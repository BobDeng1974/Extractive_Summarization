lawmakers are fuming over president @entity2 's admission on thursday that his @entity3 lacks a strategy for dealing with the rise of the @entity6 in @entity7 , with one congressman comparing his performance to the bumbling sheriff 's deputy @entity10 from ' the @entity11			1
' and as @entity3 and @entity15 members piled on with sharp criticism , a former senior aide to a retired defense secretary told @entity17 that the @entity18 are ' seeing red ' and ' spitting nails ' following @entity2 's candid admission			1
' they 're losing confidence in their mission , ' said the long - time @entity26 insider , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
' when the president does n't know what direction to point people in , all his advisers can do is guess at what he wants			2
' maybe it 's cia director [ @entity60 ] @entity59 who said earlier this year that " no , these guys do n't want a caliphate "			1
' ' he must have his head buried in a hole somewhere on the first green			0
' as @entity68 scratched its collective head , the president headed on the road friday for a political fundraising trip			0
' i do n't want to put the cart before the horse , ' @entity2 had said thursday , referring to the thorny problem of whether to attack @entity6 inside @entity7 's borders			1
' we do n't have a strategy yet			2
' ' we need to make sure we 've got clear plans , and we 're developing them , ' the president said			0
' at that point i will consult with @entity83 and make sure their voices are heard			0
' @entity3 press secretary @entity86 scrambled to mop up after the ill - timed gaffe on @entity88 , saying @entity2 ' was explicit – as he has been in the past – about the comprehensive strategy that we 'll use to confront ' @entity6			1
he repeated that word – ' comprehensive ' – in a hastily arranged appearance on @entity94			0
on friday he told reporters that the @entity2 administration is n't going to walk back the president 's choice of words , but was concerned about ' the way it was being reported ' by news outlets			1
a reporter from @entity94 had challenged him , saying that ' the fact that you came out so quickly and tried to explain what the president had to say suggests that what he said was not what he intended to say			0
' @entity86 said the @entity26 is ' developing ' a strategy to ' confront some of the challenges there			1
' @entity113 , a deputy chief of staff in the @entity114 @entity3 , said thursday night on @entity115 that he was ' appalled ' by the president 's ' we do n't have a strategy ' moment			1
' he was warned about the role that @entity6 was playing inside @entity7 , and he has had all that time to develop a strategy about what to do about @entity6 in @entity7 – and he still does n't , ' @entity113 said			2
@entity124 chairman @entity123 said on @entity94 that @entity2 's appearance thursday ' was an odd press conference at the very best , but to have a press conference to say we do n't have a strategy was really shocking given the severity of the threat			1
' @entity133 rep. @entity132 , the @entity134 ' vice presidential nominee in 2012 , said thursday night , in @entity135 said the @entity48 needs a ' strategy to finish [ @entity6 ] off			0
' ' not to contain them ... but to fundamentally finish them off , ' @entity137 said			0
' and i do n't think the president sees this moment for what it is			2
' senate minority leader @entity144 urged @entity2 ' to exercise some leadership ' and determine a plan for eradicating @entity6 that @entity83 can support			1
the president mentioned four times on thursday his intention to seek advice from @entity83 before deploying more military assets in the @entity152 , likely in response to concerns from members of the @entity3 and @entity15 that he was unconstitutionally freezing them out			2
but ' there 's no point in me asking for action on the part of @entity83 , ' @entity2 told the press corps , ' before i know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done			1
' taking over : this undated image posted on a militant website shows fighters from @entity6 marching in @entity170 , @entity7 clad in a muted tan suit that drew as many comments on @entity88 as the content of his remarks , he emphasized that he is mainly focused now on pushing back @entity6 in @entity49 , where @entity48 military jets and drones have executed more than 100 airstrikes this month			0
but he boasted that @entity48 could put down the @entity6 threat in @entity7 – at least in the short - term – at a time of his choosing			2
' as i 've said before – i think i said it in the previous press conference , ' he said , ' our military is the best in the world			0
' ' we can rout @entity6 on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily , he insisted , referring to @entity6 by the @entity3 's preferred name			1
' but then as soon as we leave , the same problems come back again			0
' ' my priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that @entity6 made in @entity49 are rolled back and that @entity49 has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself , ' the president said			0
the vicious terrorist group has its most comfortable stronghold in @entity7 , leaving open the possibility that defeating them in @entity49 could leave them more entrenched one nation to the west – in a country that shares a hotly contested border with @entity213 , a key @entity48 ally			0
the administration has green - lighted surveillance flyovers across portions of eastern @entity7 in recent days to assess @entity6 's numbers and evaluate potential military targets			2
horror : @entity220 emerged thursday showing @entity6 militants marching 250 @entity7 soldiers , lad only in their underwear , to a mass execution near the key northern @entity227 air base gathering strength : @entity6 captured this munitions warehouse in @entity170 , @entity7 on sunday @entity3 aides have leaked to a variety of news outlets the idea that @entity2 is considering striking @entity6 in @entity7 despite objections from the country 's dictator , @entity235			1
@entity7 is in general disarray as rebels from a range of moderate and militant @entity241 groups have fought a civil war for more than three years with the aim of taking over the country			0
@entity6 is among the groups that oppose @entity235			0
crushing them could strengthen the barbaric regime in @entity248 , and vice versa			0
dealing with that conundrum ' is going to be a long - term project , ' @entity2 said			2
' it 's going to require us to stabilize @entity7 in some fashion ' but identifying moderate @entity255 who can govern the country			0
expanding his @entity49 campaign to a second country , though , could highlight his administration 's failure to intervene a year ago after @entity2 warned @entity235 about the consequences of crossing a ' red line ' by deploying chemical weapons against the rebels			1
he said thursday that he has directed defense secretary @entity265 and the military 's @entity18 ' to prepare a range of options ' for him .			1
