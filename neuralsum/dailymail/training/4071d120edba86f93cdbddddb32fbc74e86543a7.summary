by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:35 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 04:37 est , 8 august 2013 new @entity3 boss @entity2 today slammed self - obsessed bankers detached from reality have become ‘ socially useless ’ and must change their ways			1
the @entity8 former investment banker demanded a change in a @entity11 culture which has become disconnected from the businesses and workers who should benefit from a properly functioning economy			1
and he vowed to ‘ snuff out ’ irresponsible behaviour , including mis - selling products to customers which they do not need just to make profit			1
criticism : @entity3 governor @entity2 said bankers who do not focus on the wider economy are ' socially useless ' mr @entity2 took charge as the first foreign governor in @entity27 last month , replacing sir @entity28			2
in his first major intervention yesterday , he announced interest rates were likely to remain at record lows for another three years			1
in a major boost for mortgage bill payers , he vowed to keep rates low until unemployment fell below 7 per cent , which is not expected to happen until late 2016			1
today he turned his fire on bankers , demanding a ‘ change in the culture ’ in reckless institutions which have been blamed for the financial crash			2
‘ the cultural issue is fundamentally important , ’ he told @entity44 ’s today programme			0
‘ there has to be a change in the culture of these institutions			2
it ’s something i ’ve spoken about in the past when i was in @entity8 , and it applies absolutely here as well			2
’ he said finance can ‘ absolutely play a socially useful and an economically useful function ’			0
but bankers and financiers had to focus on ‘ the real economy , what it does for businesses making investment , what ultimately it means for jobs in the economy ’			1
he went on : ‘ it ’s the loss of that focus , it ’s finance that becomes disconnected from the economy , from society , finance that only talks to itself and deals with each other , that becomes socially useless			2
‘ one of my other responsibilities is chairing the @entity74 and a lot of what we ’re doing there internationally is to strip out that type of behaviour			0
’ disconnected : a banking sector which ' only talks to itself and deals with each other ' is bad for the whole of society , mr @entity2 warned in particular he singled out banks who put profit before customers by selling products which they did not need			1
asked whether people working for banks should sell a product to a customer to make a profit , even if they know the product was bad for the customer , mr @entity2 said : ‘ absolutely you should n’t sell it			2
’ he stressed that conduct in the @entity11 was the responsibility of the new @entity103			0
@entity106 's interest rates are likely to remain at a record low for at least three more years , the new governor of the @entity3 said yesterday			1
the forecast was welcomed by business leaders , but will be a blow to millions of savers and pensioners			0
speaking at the @entity3 ’s quarterly inflation report yesterday , @entity2 made history by formally linking the base rate to unemployment – meaning rates will not rise from their current record low of 0.5 per cent until the jobless total falls to 7 per cent or lower			0
the @entity3 suggests this will not happen until late 2016 – another three years or more			0
unemployment stands at 7.8 per cent , having peaked at over 8 per cent in the wake of the financial crisis , and mr @entity2 said more than 750,000 jobs will need to be created to get it down to the threshold			0
but he pointed out that rates would not automatically rise when unemployment hits 7 per cent			0
he added : ‘ nor is 7 per cent a target			0
7 per cent is merely a “ way station ” at which the [ @entity131 , which sets interest rates ] will reassess the state of the economy			1
’ mr @entity2 said he has ‘ tremendous sympathy ’ for savers , who have lost out since the @entity3 slashed rates to 0.5 per cent in 2009 , but launched the aggressive tactics to ‘ secure the recovery ’			2
by the end of 2016 , rates will have been at the record low for nearly eight years – the longest period they have been on hold since the aftermath of the @entity146			2
figures published yesterday suggested savers will have been deprived of nearly £ 500billion in lost interest payments over those eight years			0
but he added : ‘ even if we ’re not directly responsible for that behaviour , it ’s that attitude in institutions that undercuts their effectiveness , is bad for the system , and to the extent that with our powers we can use them , we work to snuff them out			2
mr @entity2 was hand - picked for the job of governor by @entity163			0
he sought to reassure the public that interest rates will not rise anytime soon and hopes the use of so - called ‘ forward guidance ’ will boost confidence among households and businesses and help drive the economic recovery			1
but he said he had ‘ tremendous sympathy ’ for savers hit by the @entity3 ’s announcement that interest rates will not rise from their record low until more than 750,000 new jobs have been created			1
he said policymakers should not pull back from stimulating the economy too early or they will risk choking off the economic recovery and ending up with a similar situation to @entity181 , where interest rates have remained at rock - bottom levels for years			1
mr @entity2 said the best way to get back to normal interest rates is to have a strong economy			1
he told the programme : ‘ we have tremendous sympathy for savers			0
they have done the right thing , they have set aside some money , they are earning a lower return than they would have expected when they put money aside but the best way to get interest rates back to a normal level is to have a strong economy			1
‘ let me tell you , i first lived in this country in the 1980s			0
after that i lived in @entity181 and it was the start of life after the financial crisis and in @entity181 they made two mistakes			0
‘ the first was they did n’t fix the banks quickly enough - in the @entity106 we are fixing the banks			0
secondly , as their recoveries began , they pulled back on stimulus too early and those recoveries did n’t gather life and as a consequence , almost a quarter - century later , interest rates are still at rock - bottom levels in @entity181			1
‘ we do n’t want to make those mistakes here in the @entity106			0
this is about ensuring that in the reasonable future , and i recognise that it ’s difficult for savers , but in the reasonable future we ’re delivering that strong economy that will deliver higher interest rates and jobs			1

@entity8 demands culture change in the @entity11 to focus on real economy
vows to ' snuff out ' bad behaviour , including mis - selling products for profit
has sympathy for savers hit by promise of low interest rates until 2016
