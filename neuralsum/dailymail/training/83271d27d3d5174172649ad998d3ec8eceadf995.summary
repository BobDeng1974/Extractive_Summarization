those of us who always read newspapers from the back , often skipping the finance section , reserve the right to remain baffled by the mathematics , economics and high - stakes gambling involved			0
a £ 33million takeover bid for @entity10 dismissed as not nearly enough ? sorry , but we must be missing something awfully clever in the small print of tuesday ’s announcement to the @entity14			1
assuming we ’re not getting the @entity16 club confused with some * other * @entity10 , perhaps the famous @entity17 ice hockey franchise worth somewhere north of a billion @entity18 , the logic employed by the board – not for the first time – seems grounded in truly orwellian doublethink			1
rangers are facing financial ruin ... but the board rejected @entity26 's £ 18million bid to takeover club this is a club never more than one final reminder away from complete and utter financial meltdown			1
a company reliant on emergency loans that grant certain lenders rights beyond those of mere shareholders			0
a corporate basket case held together by hope , bits of string and bad contracts – some of which remain to be settled			0
and all of this is worth * more * than the £ 33m @entity26 was willing to spend ? even if it could be argued that they ’ve only officially rejected his £ 18m bid for a controlling stake , the £ 15m that would follow in pursuit of the rest of the shares surely represents a fair deal			1
according to the calculations of the @entity55 , @entity10 have a market capitalisation – shorthand for the overall value of all the shares available – of £ 21.18m			1
with another £ 8m required just to stay afloat and promotion to the top flight far from guaranteed , they can hardly be described as a blue - chip investment opportunity			0
yet it seems that the promise of glories to come , not the bleakness of the current situation , is what counts in matters like this			0
football is a game of dreams – and that applies equally to potential club owners as to the kid who pesters his parents to be taken to the game			2
@entity26 failed in his bid to buy a controlling stake of the @entity16 club according to football insolvency expert — and former @entity84 chairman — @entity86 , there is an obvious return to be had for whoever puts @entity10 back on a firm footing			1
@entity86 fears , though , that a power struggle and the absolute reluctance of those in charge – including @entity95 owner @entity94 , whatever the size of his actual stake – may prevent the club from fulfilling its ambitions			2
and he warns that , should the worst happen and @entity10 slide into insolvency , the men who have so casually rejected @entity26 ’s offer will have some very difficult questions to answer			1
@entity86 , whose time at @entity104 saw him temporarily stave off administration and cut debts of over £ 100m before @entity107 bought his consortium out , is an insolvency expert and partner in @entity111			2
he told @entity112 that the current @entity10 board must be very confident of finding a serious alternative to the @entity26 pitch , which may yet be revived as part of a broader takeover bid in tandem with the so - called ‘ @entity119 ’ and @entity120			1
@entity120 bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club earlier this month ‘ the story of @entity10 is something i ’ve followed going back to when they first got into trouble , so i ’m quite au fait with it , ’ said @entity86			1
‘ the problem at @entity10 , it seems to me , is that we ’re not sure who is pulling all the strings			1
is it @entity94 , is it the local directors ? unless you ’ve been sitting in on the meetings , you ’ll never know what goes on there			0
‘ as for how they can turn down an offer that is 50 per cent more than their current valuation , well it could be a negotiating tactic with an eye on this and other offers			2
‘ or it could be that the powers - that - be , whoever that may be , are prepared to put more money in rather than lose control of the club			2
@entity26 also owns @entity152 outfit @entity151 ‘ if you get @entity10 right , they will definitely be worth more than £ 21m			1
i do n’t think £ 50m or even £ 100m would be an unreasonable valuation for a @entity10 on a firm financial footing and doing well – even in @entity157			1
‘ if the current owners are n’t going to let @entity10 go for £ 33m , that suggests they have done a sounding among shareholders – and that they ’ve got an alternative plan			1
the board must be confident if they can turn something like that down , given the current financial troubles			1
‘ looking at the @entity94 situation , if you ’re asking me if i ’d rather have @entity10 than @entity95 ? well , @entity10 have more potential			1
‘ and @entity94 is a shrewd nut			0
you may not like him but he ’s a clever guy			0
he ’s put £ 130m into @entity95			0
imagine if he ’d put that into @entity10 – he ’d have a lot more in return			1
’ @entity86 ’s description of @entity95 owner @entity94 as a ‘ shrewd nut ’ is borne out by events since he first began to take an interest in events at @entity16			1
for about £ 2m worth of shares plus loans - not gifts but loans - totalling £ 3m , he has been granted a remarkable degree of influence			0
even if we accept the official explanation behind the appointment of @entity190 as chief executive , the long - time @entity94 associate apparently rising above a pack of candidates on merit alone , the fact remains that the @entity197 tycoon ’s temporary bail - out bought him the right to appoint two directors			2
having already put @entity200 on board , he still has another ace in the hole			2
another close associate who can go in there and wield influence , even if he remains barred from increasing his overall stake in the club by @entity210 rules			2
as for how @entity94 and the directors beholden to his largesse use their influence , well , there are some pretty extensive guidelines available to anyone interested in corporate law			0
reducing the concept of fiduciary duty to something we can all understand , it boils down to this : ‘ directors must use their powers for the good of the company			0
’ conflicts of interest are a definite no - no , while mention is also made of acting ‘ in good faith ’			0
in short , do n’t make decisions based on what you * want * to happen , rather than what * needs * to be done			0
@entity94 appeared to increase his control as @entity197 's @entity200 was appointed finance director no one is suggesting that the @entity10 board have come close to breaching any rules			1
all @entity86 points out is the need to be very certain that rejecting the @entity26 bid was in the best interests of everyone			2
‘ there is a risk for the @entity10 directors because , if they fail and go back into administration , then there is a potential for them to be accused of having caused it , ’ he told @entity112			1
‘ they ’ve had an offer that would have paid everybody off and put money into the club			2
if the company goes bust now , and i ’m not saying it would , you would be saying to the directors that they had a duty to shareholders to at least put the offer to them			0
so it ’s a bit of a gamble			0
‘ directors can be liable personally if they ’ve been found to have misled shareholders or if they ’ve taken decisions against common sense			2
they must have something else in place			0
‘ the best result is for everyone to work together , obviously			0
the trouble is , when you have different blocks working against each other , football takes second place to the power struggle			0
’ @entity280 struggle appears destined to continue for some time at @entity16 , as @entity26 , the @entity119 , @entity120 , the @entity282 brothers and @entity94 are joined by a cast of smaller players now prompted to declare an interest under takeover rules			1
do try to keep up with the , ahem , logic behind every major decision			0
and do n’t worry if , on occasion , the sums appear to make no sense at all .			0

@entity10 board reject @entity26 's attempt to takeover at @entity16
