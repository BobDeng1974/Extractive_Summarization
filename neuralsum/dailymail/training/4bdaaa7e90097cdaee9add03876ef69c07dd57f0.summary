‘ nobody wants to think about the cold winter coming up - we want to enjoy the sun while it lasts not start thinking about presents , turkey and snow			2
’ the switch - on is part of an experiment by the council to look into how to keep the cost of celebrating @entity8 low , after £ 15,000 worth of lights were stolen last year			2
the @entity22 rigged up the lights as a trial and plan to add lights and decorations to nine other trees in the coming weeks			1

' shops seem to start their big @entity8 push earlier each year , i think it spoils what 's so special about it			0
