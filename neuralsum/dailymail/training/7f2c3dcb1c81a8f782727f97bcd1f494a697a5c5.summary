by @entity0 and @entity1 country star @entity2 has rejected a deal to stage two matinee gigs to complete his five - show comeback special in @entity6			1
the 52 - year - old singer was offered the extra gigs on the weekend of july 26 and 27 at @entity9 , to take place before a second night - time show on each day			1
it was proposed by @entity13 as a way to break the standoff over the cancelled concerts			1
rejection : country star @entity2 , 52 , has rejected a deal to stage two matinee gigs at @entity9 in @entity6 but now , @entity2 has turned down the offer , saying it ' can not possibly compare to a five - night straight run ' and would be too much for him at his age			1
in a webcast at 5pm yesterday , he also highlighted the logistical challenge of having 160,000 fans descend on @entity9 each day			1
‘ i do n’t have a problem with matinees but sticking 160,000 people out in the middle of the day , i do n’t know if i ’m more worried for them than me because i ’m getting older , ’ he said			2
‘ i personally would do whatever it takes except cancelling on people			2
we sold 160,000 tickets to people who were coming to see the full show , and that show is only full at night			1
’ world tour : @entity2 will anounce plans for a major global tour next week last night , following tense behind - the - scenes talks , @entity40 also confirmed the proposal was ' not feasible '			1
and @entity2 ’s @entity44 publicist @entity43 remarked : ‘ to treat 160,000 people differently than all the rest who will be seeing the show the way it was meant and created is wrong			1
‘ he does not understand why it is once again put upon him to treat people less than they deserve to be treated and he still returns to why did they allow five shows to be sold and all these people to be disappointed			2
it is not his decision – it is , with the greatest of respect , the city council ’s			2
’ earlier this week , @entity2 issued an all - or - nothing ultimatum when city chiefs granted permission for just three out of the five planned sold - out gigs , which 400,000 people have booked tickets for			1
public support : @entity66 , 69 , holds a poster from @entity2 ' 1997 concert at @entity9			1
she is one of thousands protesting the cancellation the star , who has sold more than 130million albums , said to choose one show over another ' would be like asking to choose one child over another '			2
he told a press conference : ‘ if the prime minister [ @entity77 @entity76 ] himself wants to talk to me , i would crawl , swim , i will fly over there this weekend , sit in front of him			1
‘ i will drop on my knee and beg for those 400,000 people to just have fun and let them come see			2
that ’s what i want to do			2
' thousands of fans were given brief hope as news emerged of a potential breakthrough yesterday evening - with many hoping all five gigs would get the go - ahead , with a break between the final two			1
shortly before 7pm yesterday , the council said that after a meeting between city manager @entity94 and @entity40 , they would allow two matinee shows on the afternoons of the weekend concerts			1
‘ following a meeting this morning between @entity100 of @entity40 and @entity94 , chief executive of @entity13 , the @entity13 has agreed to a proposal from @entity40 designed to break the impasse that has arisen , ’ a statement said			1
the council suggested that the matinee shows ‘ will allow everybody who bought a ticket to see @entity2 ’			1
‘ it will be a matter for @entity40 and @entity2 to decide if they wish to pursue this suggestion , ' it said			1
a spokesman added that the proposals involved ‘ having the same concert on twice in the same day ’			2
but @entity2 's management later rejected the proposal , telling @entity6 lord mayor @entity115 it would be unworkable for the star , who is known for his high - octane shows			1
sources close to mr @entity100 told the @entity120 : ' this was nothing short of a flyer , a possibility			0
and it is quite clear it ai n't going to run			2
' to stage two concerts in the afternoon would be a logistical nightmare '			1
@entity77 : it comes as @entity76 ( pictured ) has snubbed an appeal from @entity2 to intervene in the matter it comes as @entity77 @entity76 has snubbed @entity2 's emotional appeal for him to intervene in the matter			1
he told the @entity132 that it was ‘ not a case of mr @entity134 moving in on top of the law and saying , “ you have to do this ” ’			0
he said : ‘ we have processes and legal systems in the country here , at the same time we have a very can - do attitude and i think the progress made today by the @entity145 and the promoter and all of the organisations involved have put on the table here a potential solution to this so lets see			1
’ ‘ mr @entity94 made his decision in accordance with the law and his responsibilities so it ’s how can you move it from that to a realisation that these concerts can take place , so let ’s see , we will continue to show an interest in hoping that it might be able to happen			2
’ the @entity77 added : ‘ people [ near @entity9 ] have withdrawn their objections and as the representatives of the people down in the @entity169 , we would like to see these things happen so i hope that ’s one potential solution that might be accepted and we will see what happens			1
’ speaking on @entity174 on @entity175 last night , @entity6 lord mayor @entity115 still did n’t rule out @entity2 making a comeback			1
‘ i ’m not going to say “ never never ” , ’ he said			0
‘ to my knowledge the management team are still on board			0
i got a call from my source at @entity183 promotions asking for a review of the plans tonight			0
i would like to see everybody facilitated , and if that is by having two gigs in three nights than so be it			2
’ meanwhile , @entity190 , chairman of the @entity191 , described the situation as a ‘ crisis ’			0
he said : ‘ the way that the community has been affected by this is quite enormous , there ’s been division , and a man who wanted to take a case has been threatened			0
‘ this is not proper social responsibility coming from @entity9			1
’ ' @entity9 needs and wants @entity2 ' : during the fiasco a split emerged among residents living near the site elsewhere , mr @entity76 revealed that he was a fan of @entity2			1
he indicated he had tickets for one of the concerts , adding that he would be one of the 400,000 people who would be ‘ out at the moment ’ because of the cancellations			2
he said people had been sending him their letters and their texts about the plans they had for the concerts and the arrangements they had made			2
he said : ‘ for those who are big followers of @entity2 music this would [ have been ] a wonderful occasion			1
’ during his online press conference yesterday , an emotional @entity2 said : ‘ today we should all be laughing and joyous but there ’s a cloud hanging over us			1
‘ up until ten days ago it was nothing but love			0
then came the thing , they said “ @entity232 , we ’re okay with three of them you ’re going to have to do figure out the other two			0
” ‘ i wish i knew where that came from			0
it ’s a simple yes but for some reason the system keeps throwing it back here			0
’ he added : ‘ the reason why it ’s a dark cloud : everybody in @entity245 who is sad about this you ’re not one billionth as sad as i am			0
‘ i ’m the real loser here , i ’m the guy who ’s out the greatest experience of his life			0
‘ you ca n’t talk about a future [ for large scale events ] in @entity245 until @entity245 has a system that works			0
let those five shows be played and fix the laws after that			2
it ’s a simple fix			0
‘ but for some reason the problem keeps getting thrown back here			0
‘ the system should be looking at itself saying we have flaws			0
’ he continued : ‘ you have a gentleman in a certain political position and he ’s standing by that decision			0
let that gentleman do his job but there should somebody who should walk over to him and say , “ we ’re going to allow these people to come and sing and have a good time			0
” ‘ i do n’t have a clue how we got here			0
all i know is that the powers that can fix it are not there			0
‘ it ’s a simple yes , open up for five nights , let everybody have fun then go to work on never letting it happen again			0
create your laws , create your guidelines but do n’t sell a show to people and get their hopes up that you ’re going to just cancel on them and that ’s okay			0
i do n’t think that ’s okay			0
‘ everybody knows we do n’t do golden circles			0
we do n’t elevate tickets or drop tickets for people with more money			0
it ’s the luck of the draw			0
’ he added : ‘ i want to hear “ @entity2 , welcome to @entity245 ”			1
i was there six months ago and i heard “ @entity2 , welcome home ”			1
’ it is understood that a solution to the matter must be found by monday .			0
