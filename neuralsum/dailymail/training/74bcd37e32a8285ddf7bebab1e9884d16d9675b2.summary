last friday , months after his initial operation , mr @entity8 , who returned home earlier this month , broke his remaining arm in three places			1

' @entity72 , a normally harmless bacteria , is usually filtered out by the body but in the father - of - one 's case , it developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome			1
mr @entity8 's major organs shut down and he spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body			1

the vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses , such as strep throat and impetigo			2
occasionally , however , the bacteria can become life - threatening if it enters parts of the body where it is not usually found - such as the blood , muscles or the lungs			2
the bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores			2
invasive group a streptococcal disease , which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body ’s defences , is a severe and sometimes life - threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body , such as the blood , deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs			2
two of the most severe forms of invasive group a streptococcal disease are called necrotising fasciitis ( infection of muscle and fat tissue ) and toxic shock syndrome ( a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs )			1
the early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever , severe pain and swelling , and redness at the wound site			0
the early symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include fever , dizziness , confusion , low blood pressure , rash and abdominal pain			1
doctors had to amputate both his legs above the knee and his left arm after his feet , fingertips , arms , lips , nose and part of his ears turned black			1

but just six months later , the 34 - year - old was back home and playing with his three - year - old son @entity26			2

he said the nerves were re-growing impressively and was expecting to be able to feel his thumb twitch shortly			0
but that has tragically been taken from him , as he prepares to adapt to life as a quadruple amputee			0
his local community in @entity179 are holding a fundraising festival for the @entity199 but mr @entity8 can no longer wheel himself onto the stage			2
ms @entity176 , said : ' he is still wonderful and full of spirits			0
' he ’s a little scared in case they find something else but he has n’t lost his sense of humour			2
mr @entity8 is set to have surgery to rebuild his lips in the next six weeks , to allow him to eat and speak normally mr @entity8 hopes he will soon learn to walk on prosthetic legs ' we hope they will amputate below the elbow but they wo n’t know until they operate and see how badly damaged the arm is			1
' the family home has been adapted to suit mr @entity8 ’s wheelchair needs and his best friend @entity218 has become his full time carer			1
before he was re-admitted to hospital , mr @entity8 said : ' our whole life has been turned upside down but for me , there ’s a lot of clarity			1
' i feel i ’ve experienced life and death and i am just so lucky to be here			0
' after his operation to reconstruct his lips , mr @entity8 will go to a specialist unit in @entity231 , south west @entity232 , for ten weeks to learn skills to regain his independence			1
this includes taking his first steps on prosthetic legs			0
he said : ‘ words can not describe how much i ca n’t wait to get walking			0
‘ all @entity26 talks about now is “ daddy when you get your legs you can kick a ball about in the garden ” and “ when you get your legs you can do this , that and the other ”			0
‘ the frustration is when i watch @entity26 playing in the garden out of the window and i ca n’t play with him			0
mr @entity8 says he is delighted to be back at home with his partner , @entity25 , and his son , @entity26 ‘ to think i could be walking by the end of the summer is just incredible			1
‘ but it does n’t take anything spectacular to make me feel great			0
it ’s these simple things , the normal things that make me so happy			0
‘ just the other day @entity218 and i were sat here watching the golf , like mates do , and that was a lovely feeling			0
‘ it was just like the old days when we used to kick back , and at that point there was n’t a care in the world			0
‘ but despite what has changed , i ’m not bitter or angry			0
i ’m proud of the fact i do n’t think i ’m mentally any different to how i was when i went into hospital			0
‘ i would n’t change anything - no way			0
