by @entity0 @entity1 has been touting the benefits of its self - driving cars for years , so a team of stuntmen decided to put the technology to the test			1
five drivers steered automated @entity9 ’ into a convoy before driving towards a lorry at a test track in @entity13			2
this video reveals the moment the leading car stops just in time , and ultimately causes the four cars behind it to all stop too			0
scroll down for full video a stunt to demonstrate the emergency stop capabilities of the @entity9 driverless car has been carried out			2
a series of cars were driven in a convoy then all the drivers , except for the first , jumped from the moving cars onto a flatbed lorry			0
a lorry in front of the procession then braked suddenly , forcing them to stop autonomously new laws are to be drawn up to allow driverless cars to take to @entity36 ’s roads			0
ministers admit the current @entity38 and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves			0
with technology being developed on both sides of the @entity46 , the government wants to ensure that @entity36 is not overtaken by @entity1 ’s determination to see its cars used legally on the streets of @entity13			0
in may @entity1 unveiled its computerised ‘ hands - free ’ self - driving bubble car , which has no steering wheel , brake or accelerator pedals , just buttons for start , pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route			0
these tests were carried out at the @entity62 , @entity13			1
as they went around the track at speeds of 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) per hour , the motorists switched on the smart cruise control and lane assist features , which allowed the cars to drive the 6.4 - mile ( 10.3km ) circuit unaided			1
at this point , a large lorry with a flatbed drove alongside and four of the stuntmen climbed out through the roofs , and jumped unaided onto the back of the hgv			1
only the driver at the front of the convoy stayed in the car , knowing there were four cars travelling behind him with no - one at the wheel			1
he then crossed his arms , with the lorry pulling up in front and slamming on the brakes			0
the @entity9 's automatic emergency braking system immediately kicked in and the car came to a standstill before it could smash into the truck			2
the remaining driver , who was in the lead car of the five - strong convoy behind the lorry , put on a blindfold and let the driverless technology in the car take the wheel - and the pedals the lorry at the front of the procession than braked heavily and the driverless technology reacted - the convoy of @entity9 cars automatically responded and stopped safely with the blindfolded driver			1
pictured is the moment the blindfolded motorist relied on auto braking to stop his car smashing into the lorry the @entity116 enables the cars to stay within the white lines of the road without any input from the driver , and it also monitor 's the car 's speed and watches out for obstacles as well the four driverless cars behind also slammed the brakes on - preventing a serious accident			1
@entity9 's ' @entity129 ' was shot in @entity13 by @entity131 - based creative agency @entity130 , with @entity133 director kit @entity132			2
@entity134 , creative director , said : ‘ as we watched the stunt men jump from their cars , leaving the empty car convoy speeding around the track , we nervously realised what an insane idea it was			0
‘ happily the cars did exactly what @entity9 promised they could and all drivers and vehicles came out unscathed			2
a team of five stuntmen each got behind the wheel of a @entity9 to showcase the @entity152 car 's safety features			0
four of them jumped from their car into a flatbed truck ( pictured ) before jumping out , the motorists switched on the smart cruise control and lane assist features , which allowed the cars to drive the 6.4 - mile ( 10.3km ) circuit unaided the cars were travelling around the track at speeds of 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) per hour before they came to a stop autonomously			1

tests of @entity9 cars were carried out at the @entity62
five stuntmen drove round the track at speeds of 50mph ( *80km/h* )
they then switched on the smart cruise control and lane assist , which allowed the cars to drive the 6.4 - mile ( 10.3km ) circuit unaided
at this point four of the stuntmen jumped out of their cars into a truck
the lead driver stayed in position with a blindfold and relied on the technology to save his life
