a ' secret technique ' has been used to create the stunning ‘ @entity22 ’ at a dozen @entity4 hotels across the country			2
each bespoke cosmic panorama has been created by artist @entity24 and his colleague who spent around three hours artistically transforming a standard white ceiling into a cosmic sky by hand painting individual shooting stars , milky ways and constellations of twinkling stars			1
whilst the three dimensional effect of the ceiling also appears to fall towards the bed by around three feet , creating a sense of immersion			0
@entity24 created the ceiling by working in the dark wearing a @entity48 headlight			0
he covered the ceiling with a base layer of special light - activated paint then used glow - in - the - dark paint that glows blue , green and aqua to add dust clouds , stars and their tails			2
