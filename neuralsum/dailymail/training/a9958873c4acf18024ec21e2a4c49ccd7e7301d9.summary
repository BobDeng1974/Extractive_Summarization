a high - stress job which left her ' burning the candle at both ends ' , combined with her mum falling very ill were the triggers that forced @entity7 to take a step back and reexamine her life			1
she quit her high - paying job in the corporate world and through her mum 's battle with cancer began to reevaluate her own health and wellbeing			1
' @entity17 was sick in 2009			0
she had colon cancer and then got diagnosed with thyroid cancer soon after , ' @entity7 told @entity20 , adding that the diagnosis was a shock as her mother had always been very healthy			1
' for us as a family it was scary of course but we all stayed as positive as we could and mum was determined to not let the illness affect her love of life			0
' through her own research @entity45 experimented with various trends and diets before discovering the @entity26 lifestyle in 2011			2
' @entity26 is a diet and i guess it ’s a lifestyle , it is inspired by our hunter gatherer ancestors			2
' we just take cues from the way our ancestors lived and look at what we as humans have thrived on , ' @entity7 explained			0
@entity7 's mum suffered from colon and thyroid cancer despite being healthy , and now grows her own vegetables the paleo diet excludes refined sugars and grains , plus dairy , legumes , and anything processed @entity7 insists the approach is just as much lifestyle - based as it is about changing what you eat now just a few years on she runs her wildly successful blog @entity77 which has over 170,000 readers a month , and has just released a cookbook of the same name			1
' it excludes refined sugar and grains , anything that comes in a package and has ingredients you ca n’t pronounce , ' @entity7 said			1
dairy , legumes and any processed foods are also banned on the @entity26 diet			2
but she insisted the approach is more lifestyle based than simply changing one 's diet , and the focus lies in many aspects of a person 's health			2
' there ’s the lifestyle aspect of paleo which does n't get talking about as much , people that follow the paleo / primal lifestyle are really focused on improving sleep , reducing stress and stress management , ' @entity7 said dairy , legumes and any processed foods are also banned on the @entity26 diet @entity7 quit her high - paying job in the corporate world to fulfill her life - long dream of working with food @entity7 's friend , letterer and designer @entity117 who worked on the cookbook ' ( it 's about ) getting outdoors and getting in touch with our more primal activities , ' she added			1
' it ’s probably more important than the food to be honest , if people did n't even follow the diet but made improvements in the lifestyle aspects it would have a huge impact			2
' @entity7 's mother is now in her late sixties but ' keeps a very active lifestyle ' and ' has a big garden where she grows vegetables and fruit and tries to eat nourishing food			1
' the author explained that her relationship with food can be traced back to her family life in @entity143 , where she grew up and lived until she was 16			0
' i have very fond memories of my childhood and everyone in the family was a big fan of cooking , ' @entity7 recalled			0
she said she remembers harvesting her own food and berries , and everything was made fresh as there were no fast food options			0
' i have very fond memories of my childhood and everyone in the family was a big fan of cooking , ' @entity7 recalled designer @entity117 helped create the front cover of the book @entity160 published by @entity161 is now available at @entity162 and @entity163 ' the cooking was kind of the centre of socialising with my family , ' @entity7 said			1
' when i look back i would consider what we ate as very nutrient dense i just did n't know it at the time			0
' my parents were quite active , my dad was an athlete and my mum was a swimmer , both competitively			0
' we spent a lot of time outside , i think i had a really good foundation , ' she added			0
with her @entity26 lifestyle @entity45 encourages people to take an 80/20 approach to ' sustain the lifestyle and a little treat every now and then '			1
' when it comes to eating well my approach is that 80 percent of the time i eat a very clean @entity26 diet , ' she explained			1
with her @entity26 lifestyle @entity45 encourages people to take an 80/20 approach to ' sustain the lifestyle and a little treat every now and then ' she said moderation and variety is the key , so people do n't get too ' obsessed with things ' ' the 20 percent is for the things i add into my diet like a little bit of white rice or dairy ' , @entity7 said before adding that the additions could be different for every person			1
' moderation and variety is the key , we just tend to get a little bit obsessed with things			0
' from a health perspective @entity7 believes the @entity26 lifestyle has reduced her stress levels , increased her energy levels , improved her immune systems and helped her deal with a whole host of chronic illnesses as simple as cold and flus			1
and with a global following of 87,000 people it seems that others are experiencing the same positive results			0
what started as a resource for others to find @entity224 recipes and support - something @entity7 struggled to discover when she initially started the blog - is now a full - time lifestyle for her			1
zucchini and @entity228 are just one of many recipes that appear in @entity7 's cookbook ingredients - @entity232 relish 3 tbsp virgin olive oil 2 medium brown onions , sliced 1 long red chilli , fi nely diced 2/3 tsp sea salt 1 garlic clove , fi nely diced 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp tomato paste 1/2 tsp coriander seed powder 1/2 cup water ingredients - @entity243 2 rashers of bacon , diced and trimmed from excess fat ghee for cooking 2 medium green zucchinis , grated ( discard the middle with seeds ) 1 medium carrot , peeled and grated 1/2 chopped green onion 2 eggs 2 tbsp tapioca fl our 2/3 tsp sea salt 1/2 tsp pepper 1/4 tsp gluten – free baking powder 3 tbsp coconut oil method ' it has completely changed my life , i still pinch myself everyday , ' @entity7 revealed			2
' i work everyday , it ’s a passion but its also a job			0
' she cooks in her @entity33 home , and creates and photographs all her own food			0
' i have a very small kitchen for someone who writes about food , ' @entity7 joked			2
although she has a few gadgets she ca n't live without such as a food processor and blender , ' i have one frying pan , it ’s all very basic '			0
