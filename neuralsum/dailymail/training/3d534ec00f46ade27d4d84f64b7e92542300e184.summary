a coroner called for a review of powerboat training after a jury yesterday ruled that the deaths of a tv executive and his daughter were both accidents			1
@entity8 , 51 , and his eight year old daughter @entity9 were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn			1
at the end of a two - day inquest into both deaths , the senior coroner for @entity17 dr @entity16 said she will write to the @entity21 to ask if it is ‘ appropriate to review the advice for the level of training required for powerboats			1
’ @entity8 ( left ) , 51 , and his eight - year - old daughter @entity9 ( right ) were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn			1
her call followed an emotional plea from mr @entity8 ’s older brother brigadier @entity34 for safety lessons to be learnt from the tragedy , during which @entity8 ’s wife @entity37 and the couple ’s other three children were also flung into the water as the 300 horsepower craft raced round in circles inflicting terrible injuries on the family			1
mrs @entity45 , 40 , lost the lower part of her left leg			0
kit , then four , was also hit by the propeller and needed 12 operations to save one of his legs			0
@entity53 , 13 , and @entity54 , 12 , escaped with minor wounds			0
brigadier @entity8 , 54 , who attended the inquest in @entity57 , @entity17 , with his wife @entity58 , said : ‘ the power in some of these craft is such that in some circumstances they can be life - threatening			2
‘ the organisations need to take things more seriously than they have in the past			0
powerboats are now more powerful than they used to be			0
incidents have more devastating effects than ever before			0
’ asked by the coroner what he would like to see done , he said the difference between training , qualifications and licences in the @entity75 and in other countries around @entity77 should be looked at			0
mrs @entity45 ( right ) took the helm of the vessel from her husband @entity8 ( left ) but did attach the ' kill cord '			1
she wept as she told the inquest that was her ‘ big mistake ’ ‘ abroad it ’s compulsory to take certain courses whereas in the @entity75 it ’s voluntary , ’ said brigadier @entity8 , who lives near @entity84 , @entity85			2
he suggested ‘ best practice ’ from abroad should be considered to avoid a repeat of the tragedy			0
@entity8 and his family , from @entity93 , @entity94 , were spending the weekend in their holiday home near @entity98 , @entity17 , when the @entity100 tragedy happened around 3.45pm on sunday may 5 last year			1
after completing several laps of the picturesque @entity102 north of @entity103 at around 30 knots - or roughly 30 mph - in the rigid inflatable boat , called @entity106 , mr @entity8 took off the ‘ kill cord ’ , which links the wearer ’s leg to the ignition and cuts the engine if they fall overboard , because he needed ‘ a wee ’ as they headed back to shore , the inquest heard			1
mrs @entity45 then took the helm but did not attach the device			0
she wept as she told the inquest that was her ‘ big mistake ’			0
the children then ‘ all called out that they wanted to go round again , ’ she said			0
the boat , seen being tailed by a local sailor attempting to bring it under control , hit the family after they fell into the water she did not think there was enough room to turn , but her husband , managing director of @entity137 ’s advertising sales division @entity137 , ‘ grabbed the wheel with his right hand and accelerated with his left hand ’ , she said			1
yesterday naval architect @entity139 , who examined the boat for the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) after the tragedy , said an ‘ error of judgement ’ may have led to mr @entity8 pushing the throttle harder than anticipated			1
‘ the throttle controls move quite easily … he was not standing in the normal position where you would push it forward and back , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think they would have foreseen it			0
this would have taken them by surprise			0
’ mr and mrs @entity45 had each undertaken a powerboat training course run by the @entity21			1
instructors described mr @entity8 as a ‘ keen , confident and responsible boat driver ’ and his wife as ‘ a very attentive student with a good level of risk awareness ’ , the inquest heard			1
but the @entity140 report found the couple were unprepared for the boat ’s reaction when it was turned at speed and then ‘ hooked ’ - the nautical equivalent of a car spinning - as they did not have the level of boat handling skills required to control such a turn			2
captain @entity173 , who led the @entity140 investigation , told the inquest the training the couple received had not provided them with an understanding of how their boat would perform in a high speed turn			2
tragedy : @entity8 , 51 , and his eight - year - old daughter @entity9 ( left ) were in a speedboat with the rest of the family , @entity37 and children ( left to right ) @entity54 , kit and @entity53 , when they were thrown from the boat and hit by the out of control vessel as it continued to circle in the water the @entity21 accepted a recommendation from the @entity140 to improve training earlier this year , he added			1
the other key safety issues identified by the @entity140 were that the ‘ kill cord ’ was not attached to the driver and that the occupants should be seated , holding on and as far aft , or close to the stern , as possible when boats are travelling at speed			2
the couple ’s four children were all sitting or standing at the front of the boat when they were thrown from it			2
yesterday @entity208 , a doctor who happened to be on a trip on another boat , said mrs @entity45 , whose leg was severed below the knee with the bone and tissue exposed , said , ‘ my life is ruined ’ and kept asking where her husband was as she tended to her after she was dragged from the water with kit by a kayaker			2
post-mortem examinations found mr @entity8 died from head injuries while @entity9 had suffered fatal multiple injuries			1
@entity45 left the inquest after giving her evidence on monday and did not attend the hearing yesterday when the jury returned their conclusions .			0
