according to the suit , filed on july 23 , in @entity21 @entity20 in @entity22 , @entity18 claims that on july 26 , 2012 , he was scheduled to take a series of @entity2 flights from his home in @entity22 to @entity27 in @entity17 to attend a conference			1
mr. @entity18 , who suffers partial paralysis of his legs stemming from a car accident in 2000 , claims he called a @entity2 customer service representative several weeks before his scheduled trip to let them know about his disability , and that he would need a lift to get onto the airplane and an aisle chair to get him to his seat			1
mr. @entity18 's initial flight was canceled due to weather , so he was booked on another flight the following day			2
when he arrived in @entity27 , he was told by flight attendants that the airline did n't have an aisle chair to get him out of his seat , nor a lift to get him off the plane			1
when he asked what he was supposed to do , mr. @entity18 claims he was told , ' i do n't know , but we ca n't get you off the plane , ' according to the complaint , first obtained by the @entity63			2
simultaneously , mr. @entity18 claims , he could see a lift available at an adjacent gate			0

when mr. @entity18 got to the airport , though , he says a flight attendant told him the chair and lift were again unavailable			0
the flight attendant then offered to put a piece of cardboard on the ground so mr. @entity18 's clothes would n't get dirty as he crawled across the ground , he claims in the suit			1
once he returned home , mr. @entity18 says @entity2 offered him 25,000 ' sky miles ' and a $ 100 voucher			2
