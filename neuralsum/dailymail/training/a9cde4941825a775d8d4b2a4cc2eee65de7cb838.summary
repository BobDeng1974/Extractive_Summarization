by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 24 july 2013 a mother who is suing a prestigious @entity3 private school has been accused of ' ranting ' at meetings and criticising teachers in an aggressive attempt to push up her children 's grades			1
the woman sent teachers a flood of letters and emails about her children 's education , a court heard - including a complaint when her six - year - old daughter received only 19 out of 20 on her spelling test			0
she is also alleged to have filed complaints about trivial issues such as a fight over a glue stick and water bottles being placed too near pupils ' shoes			1
claim : the @entity26 , pictured , has heard that a mother acted aggressively towards teachers at a top @entity3 private school the mother and her husband , a businessman , are seeking £ 50,000 in damages from the school in @entity3 , claiming teachers backtracked on a deal to give their children good references after they were withdrawn from the institution			1
at a @entity26 hearing , the school 's barrister @entity39 said that the woman had acted in a ' rude and inappropriate manner - including insisting on interrupting staff when in the middle of meetings , speaking over people , haranguing them , and on occasion screaming at them '			2
he added : ' she placed oppressive expectations on her children of constant outstanding achievement , and would admonish both child and school if her full expectations were not always met			2
' the woman , who can not be identified , allegedly pursued ' trenchant complaints ' over unimportant matters , such as bottles of water being positioned too closely to muddy pairs of shoes			0
mr @entity39 asked her , ' do you think - with hindsight - that that was quite a trivial matter ? ' , but she replied : ' it was a matter of hygiene			0
' fight : the school , not pictured , is accused of back - tracking on a deal it made when three children were withdrawn ( file photo ) on one occasion , the court heard , the mother complained that her nine - year - old son had been given an a rather than an @entity78 for a geography project			1
' it was good but not good enough , ' she said , adding that some children who achieved an @entity82 had failed to include a contents page in their essay mr @entity39 asked : ' so your child got an a and you wrote in to raise that with the school , to say he should have got an @entity78 , and you do n't see anything odd about that ? ' - she replied , ' no. ' he told the hearing that the school had no problems with the children themselves , but felt forced to ask the parents to remove them thanks to the adults ' ' particularly poor behaviour '			1
the parents withdrew their children from the school , which can not be named for legal reasons , and are now seeking damages for alleged breach of contract as well as an injunction barring the school from discussing them with any other school			1
they claim they struck a deal with the school after a ' stormy ' meeting in which the headmaster promised to provide a good reference to any school the children applied to			1
but instead he told another head that the parents had ' harassed ' him , the court heard			0
both parents deny behaving unreasonably towards staff , insisting they were doing their utmost to ensure their children 's needs were met by teachers			0
the mother said the school failed to communicate adequately with her and she only pursued issues where she felt teachers were not responding to her children 's needs			2
she had become particularly concerned by the school 's failure to provide her with her offspring 's test results , she told the court			0
friction between the parents and the school came to a head at a parents ' meeting which left staff ' visibly shaken ' and finished with the couple ' storming out ' , mr @entity39 alleged			0
however , the father denied claims that he and his wife were ' aggressive and intimidating ' at the meeting , insisting the atmosphere was ' always polite and courteous even if we disagreed '			0
