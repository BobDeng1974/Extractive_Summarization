@entity7 , founder of @entity9 , has spilled the beans on some of his greatest business regrets in his new book mr @entity7 , a former owner of @entity27 , who sold @entity9 for £ 107million in 2010 , admitted to his litany of misses in his new autobiography , @entity32 , which is published today			1
describing one of his ' head in hands moments ' , @entity7 told how he pretended to be out when @entity13 pestered him about his @entity37 album , which includes seminal hits changes and @entity39			1
@entity7 told the @entity40 : ' he was in our office in @entity43 all the time , often pleading with us for money to go and make demos			2
our receptionist would ring around and we would all pretend to be out			0
' he did decide , however , to take a 25 per cent share of the singer 's publishing rights			0
mr @entity7 said the @entity14 rushed into his office miming their future hit @entity53 , and ended up sitting on the chief executive 's knee , after which he decided not to raise a £ 250,000 bid for them on the basis that he believed only one of them could sing and none had any song - writing ability			2
rejected : mr @entity7 turned down both @entity13 , left , and @entity64 's hit musical @entity20 , right mr @entity7 said he turned down @entity64 's @entity20 because he was n't sure he could write a hit without @entity66			1
cats is now the second longest - running musical in @entity69 history and the fourth longest - running show in the @entity71 , and the music producer acknowledges that his decision ranked as one of his ' very worst '			0
another one he particularly regrets was letting the @entity77 tv show @entity22 pass him by after deciding that the show , which inspired @entity79 , was ' garbage '			0
the mogul said he passed up a chance to sign the @entity19 after he dozed off during their show in @entity85 , while he dismissed @entity18 as ' very good but very , very boring '			1
but despite all the rejections , he made more good business decisions than bad , and is currently said to be worth more than £ 70million			0
