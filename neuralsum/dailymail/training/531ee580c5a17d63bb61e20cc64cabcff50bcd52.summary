by @entity0 published : 20:15 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 12:20 est , 11 march 2014 @entity9 ' flagship @entity7 plan to ‘ guarantee ’ jobs for every young person unemployed for a year is ‘ pie in the sky ’ , @entity2 said last night			1
the @entity12 said the scheme would not work , simply creating short - term placements in the public sector at vast cost to taxpayers			2
under the plan , 18 to 24 - year - olds out of work for a year will be offered a taxpayer - funded job for six months , with those who refuse losing benefits			1
shadow chancellor @entity9 , visiting a construction in @entity25 yesterday , plans to raise taxes to pay for the youth jobs plans @entity2 blasted @entity29 's plan to give unemployed 18 - 24 - year - olds taxpayer - funded jobs @entity7 faced searching questions over the funding of the scheme , which it said would cost £ 5.5billion and be met with another tax raid on the pension pots of the better - off and a new tax on bankers ’ bonuses			1
@entity29 said the scheme was ‘ fully costed ’ and ‘ right and fair ’			2
people on the 45p top rate of tax would get only 20 per cent tax relief on pension contributions , instead of the 45 per cent they receive now			0
@entity7 would also repeat its one - off 2009 tax on bank bonuses			2
but critics pointed out the party has previously earmarked a bankers ’ bonus tax to reverse the @entity53 ’s increase in @entity54 , tax credit changes and child benefit cuts			0
the @entity57 said the party had suggested using new bank taxes to fund at least ten commitments			0
the @entity57 said official costings suggest the policy would cost £ 1.7billion more than @entity7 claims			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ they ’re re-spending the bankers ’ bonus tax yet again – and raiding hard earned pensioners ’ savings			0
the last @entity7 government did huge damage to savings and now they ’re proposing to do it again			1
’ repetition ? @entity2 said @entity29 's scheme echoes a failed one done by the previous @entity7 government he said @entity7 ’s suggestion that 80 per cent of the placements would be in the private sector was ‘ pie in the sky ’ , pointing out not one employer has signed up although the party trailed the scheme a year ago			1
he added : ‘ fundamentally , this type of scheme just does n’t work			0
‘ @entity7 ’s @entity86 , which this scheme looks very similar to , created short - term placements predominantly in the public sector			1
each placement cost £ 6,500 , and half of participants were back on benefits as soon as their time on the scheme was up			0
‘ now they are proposing another expensive scheme which will just involve more borrowing and more taxes to pay for			0
’ ' the last @entity7 government did huge damage to savings ... and now they 're proposing to do it again ' - @entity2 , @entity103 's secretary mr @entity2 said the government ’s work experience scheme was available to the young unemployed from day one , rather than after a year of unemployment			1
it was costing around £ 325 per place , 20 times cheaper than @entity7 ’s @entity86 , and had been shown to be effective at getting people off benefits and into work			2
mr @entity29 insisted : ‘ we ’ve got 56,000 young people who have been unemployed for over 12 months , a @entity7 government will tax the bankers ’ bonuses and put our young people back to work			1
’ but @entity118 , chief economist at the @entity119 , said : ‘ persistently high youth unemployment is a blight on our economy , but @entity7 ’s job scheme does not bear much scrutiny as a solution			1
no government can pull a lever in @entity128 and expect youth unemployment to disappear			0
‘ whilst a short - term placement may help some young people gain experience , it ignores the fundamental reasons for long - term unemployment , such as a welfare system which gives young people little incentive to get off benefits , and an education system that has failed to give them the skills and attitude they need to get a job			0
’ @entity144 , director of the @entity145 , warned the government had already done ‘ a lot ’ to restrict pension tax relief available to higher earners and @entity7 ’s proposal to launch a further raid was ‘ extraordinarily complex ’ .			0

@entity29 vows to hand taxpayer - funded job to unemployed 18 - 24 - year - olds
@entity155 said it echoes @entity7 's damage to savings
critics say the *budgeting* of the scheme does not fit their other policies
