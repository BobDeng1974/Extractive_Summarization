how to think like einstein by @entity2 here ’s a little bit of wish - fulfilment to keep you warm through the long winter months			1
anybody , says @entity2 , can think like @entity7 — although i had always assumed that an enormous brain was an essential qualification			1
as it happens , @entity7 had a slightly smaller brain than average , according to the men in lab coats who sliced it up			1
that ’s what happens to great thinkers after they die			2
even their skulls are n’t sacrosanct			2
@entity2 ’s previous titles include how to think like @entity23 , how to think like @entity24 and how to think like @entity25			1
he has thought more about thinking than most of us ever will			0
but he may have hit the jackpot this time			0
@entity7 had a slightly smaller brain than average , according to the men in lab coats who sliced it up for all the fun it might be to emulate the thought processes of a fictional character , a computer salesman or everyone ’s favourite smiley peacemaker , @entity7 is the motherlode			1
genius is a pathetically overused term but no one argues about it here			0
@entity7 was no infant prodigy			1
one of his teachers , dr @entity43 , said he ‘ would never get anywhere in life ’			1
( this is the only thing poor dr @entity43 is remembered for			0
) @entity48 graduated fourth out of five from @entity49 in 1900 , failed to get an academic position and , after much frustration , was compelled to take the lowly position of technical expert ( @entity54 ) at the @entity55 in @entity56			0
and yet , just four years later , he produced a series of papers that turned the world of science on its head			0
in one of them he posited the special theory of relativity			2
in another he calculated that e = mc²			0
even then , he did n’t receive his first junior professorship for another four years — or a @entity67 until 1922			0
‘ all of which goes to prove that even for an intellect as stellar as @entity7 ’s , slow and steady wins the race , ’ writes @entity2			1
‘ i have no special talents , ’ @entity7 himself said in 1952			1
‘ i am only passionately curious			1
’ ‘ i have no special talents , ’ @entity7 himself said in 1952			1
‘ i am only passionately curious			1
’ to him , the development of science was driven by the need to satisfy the longing for pure knowledge			2
he also believed that the answers were out there somewhere , waiting to be discovered			0
‘ without the belief in the inner harmony of our world , there could be no science , ’ he wrote			1
so @entity7 could combine a sense of wonder at the world with the belief that he would be able to work out what lay behind those wonders			1
it helped that he could ‘ see ’ what the vast majority of us simply can not			1
huge thickets of higher mathematics simply unravelled under his gaze			0
but once you have seen what only you can see , the next thing to do is look further			0
‘ i believe in intuitions and inspirations			2
i sometimes feel that i am right			0
i do not know that i am , ’ he said			2
not the thunderbolt of genius we might expect but a considered philosophical approach to the inner workings of the universe			0
these are not the ways of a dull conformist			0
@entity7 disliked authority and being told what to do			1
he was careless with personal relations			0
it ’s possible he loved women a little too much			0
but he not only saw the art in science , he made sure the rest of humanity knew about it too			0
‘ imagination is more important than knowledge , ’ he said in 1929			2
’ call me an old softie if you like , but i love this .			2
