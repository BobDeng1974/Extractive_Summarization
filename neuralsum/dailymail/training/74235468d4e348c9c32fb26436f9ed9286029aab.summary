by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 27 september 2013 a chemical in @entity3 soil could burn away any evidence of life before scientists are able to find it			2
perchlorate , a salt made up of chlorine and oxygen , has been shown to interfere with techniques used by the @entity12 to analyse soil samples			2
the chemical was first discovered last year when @entity12 trekked around @entity3 â€™ @entity15 sand dune			1
perchlorate , a salt made up of chlorine and oxygen , has been shown to interfere with techniques used by the @entity12 to analyse soil samples when heated , perchlorates can cause a chemical reaction that destroys organic carbon			1
@entity23 , an astrobiologist at @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , said he now believes the troublesome perchlorates are likely prevalent throughout the @entity3 surface			1
' the presence of perchlorates is n't good news for some of the techniques we 're currently using with @entity12 , ' said mr @entity23			0
' this may change the way we search for organics in the future on @entity3			0
' the @entity12 's @entity39 on @entity3 ( @entity41 ) system tests soil by heating them in an instrument , called a pyrolysis gas chromatograph mass spectrometer			1
the chemical was first discovered last year when @entity12 trekked around @entity3 ' @entity15 sand dune these break the samples down into their chemical components and determine precisely how much of each of those components is present in the sample			1
any perchlorate salts in the heated sample decompose as the temperature goes above 200 degrees @entity57 and release pure oxygen			0
perchlorates are the salts derived from perchloric acid ( pictured )			0
hydrogen atom are shown in white , oxygen in red and chlorine in green organic molecules in the sample exposed to this oxygen will then combust into carbon dioxide , destroying the molecular evidence of their presence			0
luckily , @entity23 said , some organic carbon would likely survive , either incased in more heat - resistant materials or detected before the breakdown of perchlorates			1
but @entity23 noted that scientists can account for the destroyed organic carbon by assuming a certain amount of perchlorate will always be in the @entity3 soil			1
in future tests , scientists can calculate how much organic carbon burnt away with the decomposing perchlorates in order to estimate the original amount of organic material in the soil			2
' it will be absolutely critical as we move on to other samples to compare them to the @entity15 dune to infer the presence or absence of @entity3 organic material , ' said @entity23			0
@entity23 added that @entity12 has the potential to avoid the perchlorate problem in the future by using techniques that do not involve heating the soil to the point where perchlorates break down			0
the rover already carries an apparatus capable of that , which it has n't yet used .			0

perchlorates have been shown to interfere with @entity12 's analysis
when heated , the chemical causes a reaction that destroys organic carbon
it is now believed perchlorates are prevalent throughout the @entity3 ' surface
