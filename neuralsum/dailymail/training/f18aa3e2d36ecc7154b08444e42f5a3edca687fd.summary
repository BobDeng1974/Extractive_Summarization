@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has advised @entity3 counterpart @entity2 to look upon the defensive upheaval at @entity3 as a challenge to improve his leadership skills			1
@entity7 , regarded as one of the best shot - stoppers in the world , has conceded 13 goals in seven games this season and looked a forlorn figure with the personnel in front of him changing regularly due to injury , suspension and differing formations			1
@entity0 , 35 , spent three seasons at @entity3 as a young goalkeeper and believes 23 - year - old @entity2 needs to learn how to play more of a key role in marshalling his back - four			1
' @entity7 is still a young goalkeeper , even as talented as he is			1
if he can learn that , how to get your point across to different players and get them to respond to you very quickly , that will be a good lesson			1
' you have to use a lot of body language , when the ball is out of play and there is a lull in the crowd , you try to make your point concisely			2
' you talk to players in the dressing room before the game			2
you do n't want to cloud their thoughts with too many things but you get a few points across to them			2
it is all a learning process			2
' it feels like it was only in the last five years when i turned 30 that i started to really perfect things so it takes a while			2
but some guys do it quicker than others			2
' @entity7 ( centre ) has conceded 13 goals in just seven games this season , including against @entity72 @entity74 stopper @entity0 insists @entity7 should embrace ' the challenge ' he currently faces at @entity3 @entity0 was part of @entity1 's seen that gained their first victory at @entity32 in 17 years last season and quipped : ' we cracked it , so we want do it again			1
' and despite @entity1 currently lying 15th in the table with only one @entity84 victory this season , the @entity74 regards @entity86 's suspension for @entity3 as a big boost for his team			1
@entity0 will come up against world stars like @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 at @entity32 but still thinks the absence of his former @entity3 team - mate @entity86 is cause for optimism after the striker was sent off last weekend for kicking @entity97 against @entity72			1
' it is great for us that @entity86 wo n't be playing			0
everyone has an opinion about him but as far as i am concerned , @entity86 is a threat			0
he is a very dangerous threat			0
' the more of those you can eliminate , the better			0
from his standpoint , it is disappointing he is suspended			0
but for us , it helps us			0
it is one less thing to worry about			0
' @entity0 , who has been at @entity1 seven years and equalled the club 's @entity114 appearance record when he faced @entity116 in the @entity117 on thursday , is enjoying an extraordinary indian summer to his career			1
@entity0 says it is ' great ' @entity86 will miss @entity3 's clash with @entity1 through suspension his @entity124 performances for the @entity74 led to a phone call of congratulations from @entity74 president @entity127 and a petition for airports to be named after him			1
there has been a minor backlash this season with @entity0 scrutinised for every goal conceded , particularly when @entity1 were surprisingly beaten at home by @entity136			1
' if i came back again as a footballer , i 'd choose to be a number nine			0
you can miss five chances , score one goal , and you are a hero , ' smiled @entity0			1
' goalkeepers get caned all over the gaffe			0
part of being a top goalkeeper is handling it			2
there are two goalkeepers in @entity150 at the moment ( presumably @entity152 and @entity153 , though @entity0 declined to name them ) who are getting crucified			1
it is a witch - hunt			0
' ' i have been at this a long time			0
the celebrity thing and all that nonsense happened and i was suddenly being invited to all these events and premieres			0
if it had happened to me as a young kid , it might have been different but i ended up declining most of them to stay at home with the family			0
i just doing the regular everyday stuff			0

@entity0 thinks @entity2 can benefit from his side 's poor defence
@entity1 stopper believes @entity3 counterpart must embrace ' the challenge ' he faces at the moment and learn ' a good lesson '
@entity7 has conceded 13 goals in just seven matches for @entity3 this year
@entity0 says it is all part of improving and growing as a goalkeeper
