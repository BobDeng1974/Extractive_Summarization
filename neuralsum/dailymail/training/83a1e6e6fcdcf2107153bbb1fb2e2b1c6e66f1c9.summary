most casinos in @entity37 had refused to even offer odds on the fight , so certain they were that @entity2 would annihilate his opposition			1

“ it was just great - i have great memories of that night , the preparation , just focusing , feeling good about going in there and doing something everybody thought was impossible , ” he said			0
“ i fought hard that night , i was in shape and he went down			0
” but @entity2 was not willing to hand over his title that easily , and soon after the fight launched a campaign to strip @entity0 of the title – claiming he should have been counted out in the eighth round			1

i just did n’t give a darn			0

‘ i put on all that weight and i almost passed away			0
but i got a second chance and i came through			0
‘ i woke up after being in the coma for about three days and i decided right there and then it was my time to get back on the horse and start riding again instead of sitting around moping and feeling bad about myself			0

‘ it was depression , the way everything went , my boxing career , the way everything came crashing to an end			0
‘ i was really down about everything but i did n’t really have anyone to talk to about it			0
my wife was always someone i talked to and confided in but she was n’t around then so i had to just get through it			0
