by @entity1 reporter published : 03:22 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 03:23 est , 19 september 2012 one of the biggest @entity3 drug lords was captured tuesday night after building his trafficking empire for nearly two decades			2
@entity6 , who is known as ' @entity7 ' or ' the @entity8 ' , was arrested in neighboring @entity9 , topping off a year of significant blows to the region 's drug trade			1
it was the third arrest of a major @entity3 drug boss in the last year			1
president @entity15 said @entity6 was arrested in the @entity9 city of @entity17 after months of multi-national cooperation that included help from the @entity21 and other nations			0
captured : @entity6 ' @entity23 ' @entity6 was caught in neighboring @entity9 but is expected to be extradited to @entity3 in the coming days given that his massive drug trade is based in the country ' the last of the great capos has fallen , ' mr @entity15 said , using the common term for drug lords			1
' this is perhaps the most important arrest ' in recent times , he said			0
general @entity32 , director of the @entity33 , said in a telephone interview later that the 50 - year - old @entity6 did not resist when he was caught alone on a road in @entity17 , which is near the @entity3 - @entity9 border			1
general @entity32 said he expected @entity9 to deport @entity6 , but did not know when			0
the @entity38 reports that in addition to the @entity9 drug police , the @entity39 and @entity41 intelligence officers aided the operation			0
while regional authorities obviously played a significant role in the takedown , the true extent of international help is slowly being revealed as the head of the @entity3 national police , major general @entity52 was in @entity53 at the time of the arrest in order to better facilitate communication with the @entity21			2
@entity6 was one of @entity3 's most wanted fugitives			2
early last year , authorities announced a $ 2.7million reward for information leading to his capture , but @entity3 officials did not say whether any tips from informants led to the arrest			2
proud of the capture : president @entity15 ( right ) announced ' the last of the great capos has fallen ' @entity21 and @entity3 officials have alleged that @entity6 's gang supplies cocaine to @entity73 's @entity72 , which ships the drug to the @entity21			1
@entity6 's arrest was the third involving alleged @entity3 drug kingpins over the past 12 months			1
on june 3 , @entity9 authorities arrested @entity79 , 41 , who had a five million @entity21 dollar reward on his head for allegedly trafficking cocaine to the @entity21			0
he was sent to @entity3 a few weeks later			0
last november , @entity83 , 39 , another alleged drug boss with a five million @entity21 dollar reward offered for him by the @entity21 , was caught in @entity9			0
he was extradited directly to the @entity21 in december			0
while his capture is clearly a milestone in his personal criminal history , it is far from his first run - in with the law			0
previous find : in october 2010 , @entity3 police discovered $ 29million and 17million euros that belonged to @entity6 in what was - at the time - the ' biggest seizure of drug money in this country 's history ' @entity6 was first imprisoned in february 1990 on drug charges but he managed to escape from the @entity3 prison in october of that same year			1
more recently , in october 2010 , @entity3 police discovered $ 29million and 17million euros that belonged to @entity6 in what was - at the time - the ' biggest seizure of drug money in this country 's history '			1
along with taking down one of the country 's top drug kingpins , tuesday 's arrest will greatly hinder @entity3 's largest rebel group , the @entity107 ( commonly known as @entity107 )			2
@entity6 was closely associated with the group			0
@entity6 is seen as the closest equivalent to a modern - day @entity110 , with comparisons between the two drug lords being made frequently as they both developed ways to use bribery as a way to insure that they remained well - liked by prominent political figures from all sides of the spectrum			1
since @entity110 was killed in 1993 , the widespread nature of @entity6 â€™s trafficking lent him the title as the most notorious @entity3 drug dealer .			1

@entity6 has been major drug trafficker for over 20 years
@entity3 president announced his arrest on national *television*
@entity6 , known as ' @entity7 ' , is considered modern - day @entity110
