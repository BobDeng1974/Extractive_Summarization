the first evidence of sexual intimacy has been discovered in the fossil of ancient fish , who engaged in the act in unusual ways long before originally predicted			2
professor @entity7 has narrowed down the exact time in evolutionary history when sexual intercourse was first developed as a means for reproduction due to a 1cm bone in the male			2
professor @entity7 and his team from @entity17 in @entity18 published their findings in the scientific journal nature today , which detailed that the first organisms to have sex were small armoured @entity24 fish			1
professor @entity7 has narrowed down the exact time in evolutionary history when sexual intercourse was first developed as a means for reproduction due to a 1cm bone in the male the first organisms to have sex were small armoured @entity24 fish with l - shaped claspers fossils of the ancient creatures , called antiarch placoderms , date from 430 million years ago and show that they were the first to develop differential male and female genitalia , and began engaging in the act in the freshwater lakes in which they lived			1
the paleontologist said he first came across a lone 1cm l - shaped bone last year in a fossil collection from private and museum sources from @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , reported the @entity48			1
' when you look at the shape of these structures they ca n't possibly do anything in a missionary position , ' said professor long			0
' we 've printed out 3d models of these fish and i can play mating games with them and the only way possible they can do it is sideways , square dance style , with their little arms entangled , ' he said			1
the @entity44 fossil collection revealed the most primitive sexual organ ever found , allowing internal sex for the first time			0
these sexual acts were not performed front on			0
instead the fish engaged in intercourse on the side , with the male possessing a pair of claspers designed to lock male genitalia in place for mating			1
the l - shaped claspers were inserted into the female 's mirrored genital holes , aiding the behaviour and ensuring successful reproduction			1
significantly , professor @entity7 said that this discovery also indicated that the sexual act was not purely for practical measures			0
' this is not just about bony structures on these fish , it 's about the evolution of behaviour , of when sex first became fun , ' he said			2
' why would something develop these big bony clasper things and place them inside a female unless they enjoyed the act			0
' the paleontologist said that this is one of the first indications of the evolution of sexual intercourse leading up to humans			0

armoured @entity24 fish were the first organisms to have sex
the male fish had l - shaped genitalia which they used to clasp onto females to ensure successful mating
the fish had sex side on or in square dance style with limbs intertwined
the shape indicates that the fish engaged in intercourse for pleasure as well as reproduction
