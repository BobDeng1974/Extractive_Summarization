by @entity0 published : 17:42 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 10 september 2013 belligerent : @entity1 said the @entity2 must back off from threatened air strikes before @entity4 would help make @entity6 hand over chemical weapons stockpiles @entity1 said last night @entity8 must withdraw the threat of @entity2 air strikes against @entity6 before @entity4 would back plans to make @entity13 hand over @entity6 ’s vast chemical weapons arsenal			1
the @entity4 president delivered his ultimatum as the @entity2 , @entity17 and @entity18 prepared to table a @entity21 resolution to force @entity6 to surrender an estimated 1,000 tonnes of poison gas			1
the @entity24 allies are also expected to insist that @entity13 faces trial for war crimes in the @entity27			1
president @entity1 ’s intervention stepped up diplomatic pressure on @entity30 as a vote in @entity32 on missile strikes against @entity13 ’s regime was postponed as a result of impromptu remarks by @entity2 secretary of state @entity37			1
mr @entity37 suggested air strikes could be avoided if @entity6 agreed to put its weapon stocks under ‘ international control ’			2
diplomatic sources said mr @entity37 had blundered in making the suggestion on a visit to @entity44			2
although there had been some discussion of how to make safe @entity6 ’s chemical weapons – the biggest stockpile in the world – @entity24 leaders had envisaged such steps being taken after @entity2 - led military strikes			1
but as @entity4 – belligerent ally of @entity13 – seized on mr @entity37 ’s remarks , the @entity6 government quickly said it accepted its proposal on surrendering chemical weapons			1
foreign minister @entity58 said @entity6 would declare its chemical weapons arsenal and sign the international chemical weapons convention			0
and the @entity4 president insisted the @entity2 renounce the option of taking military action in @entity6 to allow checks on @entity65 ’s chemical arsenal to go ahead			1
‘ it all makes sense and can work if the @entity2 side and all those who support it renounce the use of force , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
@entity72 also said it was backing the plan			0
‘ we are offering president @entity8 a way out , ’ its government said			2
political pressure : president @entity8 is seen leaving a lunch with @entity79 yesterday where he tried to drum up support for his administration 's plans to launch punitive military attacks on @entity6 the @entity2 , @entity17 and other allies say there is conclusive evidence that @entity6 government forces carried out a sarin attack in @entity65 on august 21 , killing 1,429 people			1
but the @entity91 ’s response has been thrown into turmoil by the @entity17 @entity94 ’s refusal to back military action , followed by president @entity8 ’s decision to delay and hold a vote in @entity32			0
after speaking by phone with the @entity2 president yesterday , @entity98 warned that the plan must not be a ‘ distraction ’ from ensuring that action is taking in response to the use of nerve gas against civilians			1
blunder : a vote in @entity32 on missile strikes against @entity6 was postponed as a result of remarks by @entity2 secretary of state @entity37 the prime minister told @entity114 the @entity4 plan was ‘ an interesting proposal ’ , adding : ‘ if it is a serious one , then it is one we should take very seriously , because it could achieve a major goal we have as a government – to get rid of chemical weapons			1
‘ it is important to make sure that this is n’t some delaying tactic , that this is n’t some ruse			0
in the resolution , i think it ’s quite important that we have some clarity about thresholds			0
' we need to know that there ’s a proper timetable for doing this , we need to know that there would be a proper process for doing it , and crucially there would have to be consequences if it was n’t done			0
’ mr @entity98 said @entity6 ’s chemical arsenal was the biggest in the world and the plan should mean that it is not only handed over to an international agency , but also destroyed			0
mr @entity98 added : ‘ if this is a serious proposal , we should treat it accordingly			0
of course we should be sceptical , of course we should not forget a war crime has been committed			0
‘ this could be a major step forward , but we need to test it out properly			0
i think we should also be clear that none of this would be happening if there was n’t serious international pressure , led by the @entity2 , on @entity6 over the issue of chemical weapons			2
’ mr @entity98 said the @entity21 resolution would contain thresholds for @entity6 action and a clear timetable			2
he added : ‘ standing back from this and looking at the overall picture , if we can achieve the removal and the destruction of the biggest chemical weapons arsenal in the world , that would be a significant step forward			0
’ president @entity8 said the proposal was ‘ potentially a significant breakthrough ’ , but he remained sceptical that @entity6 would carry it out			0
the @entity6 foreign minister said the move would ‘ remove grounds for @entity2 aggression ’ .			2
