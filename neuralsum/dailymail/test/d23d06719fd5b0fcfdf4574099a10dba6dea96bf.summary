health officials say a drug - resistant mutant super-strain of a nasty stomach bug has made its way into the @entity4 and is spreading - already causing more than 200 illnesses since last may			1
shigella infections , otherwise known as ' @entity7 ' or ' @entity8 ' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the @entity10 , @entity11 or other countries			1
the symptoms include diarrhea , stomach cramps and nausea			1
outbreaks of the @entity19 bacteria are not unusual , but this strain is resistant to the antibiotic most commonly prescribed for adults			1
cases of shigellosis ( bacteria pictured ) , otherwise known as ' @entity7 ' or ' @entity8 ' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the @entity10 , @entity11 or other countries the @entity28 released the report thursday			1
the superbug sickened at least 243 people , in 32 states and @entity33			0
sometimes antibiotics are prescribed , especially for more serious cases			1
@entity28 director @entity36 said in a statement : ' these outbreaks show a troubling trend in @entity19 infections in the @entity4			0
' drug - resistant infections are harder to treat and because @entity19 spreads so easily between people , the potential for more – and larger – outbreaks is a real concern			0
' we ’re moving quickly to implement a national strategy to curb antibiotic resistance because we ca n’t take for granted that we ’ll always have the drugs we need to fight common infections			0
scientists unlocked the genetic code of bacteria grown from a soldier who died of dysentery in @entity56 their findings revealed a superbug already resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics decades before they were in common use			2
@entity28 director @entity36 said the spike in outbreaks show a ' troubling trend ' in @entity19 infections across the @entity4 @entity66 of @entity68 's @entity67 said last november that analysis of genetic differences between this 1915 sample of @entity72 and three others isolated in 1954 , 1984 and 2002 showed that while the bacterium has changed relatively little , the mutations it has acquired have made it more dangerous and persistent			0
it also went though what is known as a ' serotype conversion ' , she said , which made it able to re-infect and cause illness in people who had already been infected before and would previously have been immune to further attacks			0
@entity19 causes an estimated 500,000 cases of diarrhea in the @entity4 every year			2
@entity28 and public health partners investigated several recent clusters of shigellosis in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 and found that nearly 90 percent of the cases tested were resistant to ciprofloxacin ( @entity96 ) , the first choice to treat shigellosis among adults in the @entity4 .			2

cases have been traced to ill travelers from @entity11 and @entity10
symptoms include diarrhea , stomach cramps and nausea
sometimes antibiotics are prescribed for more serious cases
however strain has become *increasingly* resistant to drugs
