@entity1 fans are proposing a large - scale protest in the @entity3 for the visit of @entity5 to mark their frustration at the club ’s direction			1
three supporter websites are calling on match - goers with tickets in @entity3 ’s famous stand to leave their seat vacant until eight minutes has elapsed			2
that timing reflects the number of full seasons @entity17 has owned the club , while leaving 82 minutes on the clock for supporters to back their team			1
@entity1 won the @entity22 in 1982			2
@entity1 supporters are set to stage a protest during their side 's @entity26 clash against @entity5 @entity28 ( centre ) is coming under growing pressure from the club 's fans following their poor run of form an open letter has been posted on the www.thevillablog.co.uk , @entity37 , and www.avillafan.com and requests fans vote with their feet to make a statement			1
@entity1 have only scored 12 times in 23 games this season in all competitions – the lowest total of any in @entity48 football ’s top four tiers			1
@entity28 ’s side are 13th , three points above the relegation zone following a run of two wins in 17 league games			1
now , read the open letter in full ... @entity1 and @entity57 players clash during their @entity26 match at the @entity59 this letter has n’t been easy to write and it ’s also taken time to decide if we should , but as @entity1 supporters can we really go on any longer like this ? our three sites have come together to write this letter because there has been a lot of talk the last few days of protests			1
add to that , unsavory scenes between @entity1 supporters in the stands at recent games , both at home and away , it ’s now time to do something			1
as @entity1 supporters , we all want the same thing - we want @entity81			1
we believe there is no better way of showing the board how we feel than having an empty @entity3 for the first eight minutes of the @entity5 match this weekend , one for the past eight seasons under the current regime			2
after the eight minutes then take your seat and support the team fully for the remaining 82 minutes , a number synonymous with @entity1 ’s finest hour			2
under the previous chairman , when the @entity3 wanted to be heard , @entity93 would hear and more often than not , he would act			0
in truth , he often acted before it got this bad			0
our current owner ca n’t hear the @entity3 as he ’s sat thousands of miles away , so let him see it			0
we want @entity100 back why have we gone this far ? for reasons only a few people know , @entity28 was awarded a new contract this season after two seasons of under achievement			0
but as it ’s the decision of the club to stick with the manager and in our role as supporters , knowing the owner is n’t going to change his mind while trying to sell the club , we have to play our part			2
however , things are not right at @entity1 and it ’s not just under @entity28			1
there have been too many seasons of under achievement and this great club and its supporters deserve better			0
it ’s clear to the footballing world that things are not as they should be at @entity1 and unless things change soon , the decline will continue			0
this is a peaceful demonstration followed up by good old fashioned @entity1 support			0
this is a message that if absolutely everything is not done to drive @entity1 forward , it ’s possible that more supporters are going to leave the @entity3 , but this time not come back			1
and if you ’re reading this , you have a big part to play , even if you do n’t sit in the @entity3			0
download this letter , print as many copies as you can and hand it out to fellow @entity141 at @entity3 this weekend			0
and do n’t forget to sign your name to it			0
saturday is fundamentally a warning sign and we truly hope that by acting together as supporters , we ’re demonstrating that our role is still one that should be considered very important by the @entity121			0

supporters ' groups urging fans to leave their seats empty for eight minutes
@entity1 fans *unhappy* with direction of club under owner @entity17
@entity28 's side are 13th in the table and have scored only *11* goals
