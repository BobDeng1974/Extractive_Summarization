by @entity0 published : 20:29 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 20:29 est , 5 february 2013 cuddle : tv presenter @entity2 pictured with chancellor @entity3 at the @entity4 the @entity5 flowed like water at £ 100 a bottle , served in blue glass flutes which matched the azure carpet and the collars of the mandarin jackets worn by the silver - service waiters			1
but the @entity13 ’ £ 400 - a - head winter ball , once the social highlight of the party ’s year , was meant to be a private affair			1
all the same there was not much sign of recession			2
around 600 guests arrived at the glass - roofed ballroom of the @entity24 in @entity25 — where the dress code was ‘ winter glamour ’ : black tie for men and floor - length ball gowns for the women			1
but not quite so low - key for when ordinary club members complained about being unable to get in the entrance because of all the @entity34 and @entity35 clogging the drive			1
they were airily informed by staff : ‘ we ’ve been told not to say anything			2
’ with an eye , no doubt , on last night ’s vote , @entity40 , dressed in a lounge suit , made a speech about how the @entity46 had modernised and were no longer the party of privilege			1
‘ it was brilliant , ’ says tv presenter @entity2 , who cuddled chancellor @entity3 and tackled the pm about gay marriage			2
‘ i had brought a gay friend , @entity54 , and was determined to speak to @entity40 about gay marriage and introduce him because he wants to get married , ’ says @entity2 , ex-wife of @entity53 footballer @entity52			1
‘ the prime minister was very encouraging so i kissed him on the cheek to say thank you			2
’ @entity40 ’s egalitarian theme was somewhat at odds with the opulence of the party , where guests included property magnates @entity64 and @entity66 and an auction where one wealthy supporter paid £ 100,000 for a painting of the pm			1
@entity71 venue : 600 guests were invited to the @entity24 in @entity25 for the @entity72 's @entity4 tables were laden with vases of ivory - coloured roses and lilies and the menu included goat ’s cheese with beetroot , lamb in samphire and strawberry mousse			1
but perhaps the most significant feature was @entity40 ’s speech			1
‘ not everyone stood to applaud , ’ i am told			2
beards , almost extinct at @entity89 under @entity90 and @entity91 — both hated facial hair — are making a comeback			2
the latest mp to have sprouted is @entity95 , who has returned from a research trip to @entity99 bewhiskered			2
‘ i am going for the @entity103 look , ’ laughs @entity100 , stroking his furry chops			0
impressive though his three - week growth is , @entity100 has some way to go before matching @entity106 lookalike @entity107			1
for all this there are no beards in @entity110			0
though that is not to say high office is not a hairy place			0
while the cake - baking brother of the @entity118 has his heart set on building up his own successful business empire , it seems that @entity120 still has a little way to go			1
the latest set of accounts for a company set up by @entity120 , 25 , show it was far from being in profit at the end of its first financial year and had debts of more than £ 24,000			1
but an entry in the accounts for his grandly named @entity131 suggests there is no need to panic — his debts are guaranteed by a relative			0
‘ the bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director ’s family , ’ says the note			0
in an interview last year , @entity143 - educated @entity120 said that he wanted to be known for standing on his own two feet , and added : ‘ nothing is handed to anyone on a plate ’			1
he set up his first business selling ingredients for people to make their own cakes at home in 2007			0
it now operates through his parents ’ @entity154 website from premises next door to their business in @entity159			0
the accounts for @entity131 for the year up to the end of last april show it had debts of £ 32,575 owing to creditors			1
after the deduction of stocks worth £ 3,320 and money owed from debtors of £ 5,151 , it had net current liabilities of £ 24,104			2
last heard of working in a @entity174 cake shop , former tv presenter @entity172 is unlikely to tuck into pastries in future , well not if she heeds the advice of her bank			0
she claims staff there told her to ‘ eat less food ’			0
while that might be good advice for someone overweight , pencil - slim @entity172 , ex-wife of rock star @entity184 and a former face of @entity186 , was not impressed			2
cutting costs : @entity172 was told by her bank she could cut her outgoing by eating less food @entity172 , 53 , who has a daughter by @entity184 and a teenage son by another relationship , says : ‘ i have just agreed to part company with @entity197 after over 30 years			0
having frozen my accounts i was told by an “ adviser ” to cut my outgoings by eating less food			0
’ @entity197 says : ‘ we ca n’t comment on individuals , but if someone had gone over their agreed overdraft it would be a reason to freeze the account			0
we would give them an expenditure sheet and there would be questions about their outgoings including the cost of any mortgage and household bills , including food			0
’ adored by @entity25 ’s right - on critics , architect @entity211 is not quite so revered in @entity212 , where his plans for @entity215 ’s public library , which featured in the film @entity216 , have attracted opprobrium			1
@entity219 , of the @entity220 , says : ‘ the designs have all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall			0
‘ what results is an awkward , cramped , banal pastiche of tiers facing claustrophobia - inducing windows , built around a space - wasting atrium with a curved staircase more suited to a @entity232 hotel			2
i ’m not buying it			0
’ turning to one of @entity211 ’s @entity25 projects , @entity219 adds : ‘ i am reminded that he is also responsible for the canopied enclosure of the inner court at the @entity238 , a pompous waste of public space that inserts a shopping gallery into the heart of a sublime cultural institution			1
’ these are tough times for @entity245			0
the former wife of @entity248 @entity247 is in @entity249 to tie up the affairs of her brother @entity251 , who has died unexpectedly			0
@entity245 cut short a conference on ocean pollution with @entity254 to dash to @entity251 ’s hospital bedside in @entity256 when he was taken ill. ‘ @entity245 is devastated , ’ a friend tells me			0
‘ she and @entity251 were very close growing up in @entity259 , where their father was a diplomat			0
’ @entity245 ’s daughter @entity262 , is said to have been a considerable comfort to her mother			0
@entity265 the @entity72 winter ball , @entity40 made a beeline for louche club owner @entity268			1
shaking 72 - year - old @entity270 ’s hand , @entity40 told him : ‘ i see you are taking on @entity272 , ’ — a reference to my item last week about @entity268 ’s threat to stand against the @entity107 leader if he made another reference to his taking the pensioners ’ @entity280			1
‘ @entity40 was very jovial and joked with @entity268 that he could provide some tips for handling @entity272 , ’ i am told .			1

£ 400 - a - head winter ball was held at the @entity24 in @entity25
@entity40 made a speech about how the @entity46 had modernised and were no longer the party of privilege
