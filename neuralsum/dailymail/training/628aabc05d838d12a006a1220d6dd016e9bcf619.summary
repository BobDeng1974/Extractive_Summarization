by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 10:26 est , 23 january 2014 @entity3 's agent has been locked in talks with @entity6 chief executive @entity5 over a new deal for the @entity9 star			1
@entity3 , who has 18 months left to run on his contract , has attracted interest from @entity13 and @entity15 giants @entity14			1
the forward 's agent @entity16 was at @entity6 's @entity19 training base on wednesday before returning on thursday morning to hold further discussions , with @entity3 's @entity22 future topping the agenda			1
in the driving seat : @entity3 and @entity16 held discussions with @entity5 over a new deal in demand : @entity3 has attracted interest from @entity13 and @entity15 giants @entity14 @entity6 will resist any attempts by @entity14 to force through a deal for the 28 - year - old , who , as revealed by @entity32 earlier this week , is on a list of three centre forward targets for the @entity37 club this summer			1
@entity3 is wanted by @entity38 , with the former @entity13 boss also interested in @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity43 striker @entity42			2
when informed at the weekend that @entity13 's @entity45 had predicted @entity3 would be sold abroad this summer , @entity6 manager @entity44 said : ' i disagree '			2
@entity6 , who were dumped out of the @entity48 by @entity49 on penalties on wednesday night , will be boosted by the imminent £ 37million arrival of @entity52 from @entity13 who arrived at @entity19 on thursday morning			1
uncertain : the @entity9 international 's future remains in the balance - although @entity6 are keen for him to sign @entity52 will undergo a medical at @entity58 ahead of the move , which will be a club record fee for the @entity62 champions			2
but earlier this week , @entity6 legend @entity63 questioned the signing of @entity52			1
the @entity66 pundit does not believe the @entity67 , who fell out of favour under @entity45 at @entity69 , fits in with the ' typical philosophy ' of @entity6			0
in a series of tweets , @entity9 's assistant manager said : ' does he fit in with what i would call the typical philosophy of @entity6 ? i would say no. ' positives of signing a player like him are obvious - lift everyone ( spark ) creativity , knows @entity62 , 4th place chances go up - fantastic player			0
' on the move : @entity52 will join @entity6 in a £ 37million deal from rivals @entity13 then , on @entity66 ' @entity89 show , @entity63 added : ' the first question , i think , is where are you going to play ? @entity3 and @entity94 are up top if they are fit so where are you going to play him ? are you going to play him off the left or off the right ? ' maybe they have to change the philosophy and maybe that 's what @entity44 is thinking			1
maybe he wants to play narrow wide players and maybe a three in midfield			0
' they would have to change to accommodate @entity52 in the way they normally play			0
they normally play with wide players			0
' he 's obviously a fantastic football player , there 's no doubt about that , but one thing it does do , i suppose , is that @entity44 , @entity6 and @entity5 need to sign a big player			0
' they need to make a noise and if they get him in it will attract potentially other players - and they need three or four players			0
' what it could be is the start of something to lead to other things , but typically i would n't say he fits			0
