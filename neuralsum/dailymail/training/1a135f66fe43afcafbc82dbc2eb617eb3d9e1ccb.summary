by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 06:35 est , 7 august 2012 a colourful , fruit - eating bird with a black mask , pale belly and scarlet breast has been discovered and named following an expedition to the remote @entity7 andes			1
the @entity8 , or @entity8 , is described by @entity10 graduates in a paper published in the july 2012 issue of @entity13 , the official publication of the @entity15			1
the team discovered the barbet on a ridge of mountainous cloud forest in the @entity21 range in the eastern @entity6			2
the @entity8 , @entity8 , has been discovered and named by @entity10 graduates following an expedition to the remote @entity7 @entity6 the new species was discovered during a 2008 expedition led by @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , young ornithologists who had recently graduated from @entity10			1
steep ridges and deep river gorges in the @entity6 produce many isolated habitats and microclimates that give rise to uniquely evolved species			2
though clearly a sister species of the @entity37 , the @entity8 is readily distinguished by differences in color on the bird 's flanks , lower back and thighs , and a wider , darker scarlet breast band			0
@entity45 in @entity7 : the unique terrain of the surrounding area leads to a diverse range of species by comparing mitochondrial dna sequences of the new barbet to dna sequences of its close relatives in the genus @entity56 , the team secured genetic evidence that this is a new species in the barbet family			0
the genetic work was done by co-author @entity62 at @entity63 in @entity64			0
the team chose the scientific name , @entity8 , in honor of @entity69 executive director @entity68 , who discovered and named seven new bird species in @entity7 during the 1970s and ' 80s			1
@entity28 said : ' @entity72 has inspired generations of young ornithologists in scientific discovery and conservation			0
' he was behind us all the way when we presented our plan for this expedition			0

@entity82 named after @entity10 director who discovered new species in the 1970s and 1980s
