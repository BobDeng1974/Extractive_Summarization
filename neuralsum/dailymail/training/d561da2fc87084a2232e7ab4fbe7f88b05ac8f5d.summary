by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:23 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 19:53 est , 23 december 2012 @entity3 boss @entity2 was fighting for his credibility last night as senior @entity5 said he was ‘ completely compromised ’ by the police ‘ stitch - up ’ of @entity8			1
the @entity9 flew home from holiday amid claims that he blindly accepted the word of officers in @entity15 who said the former @entity18 chief whip called them ‘ plebs ’			1
mr @entity2 was even branded ‘ extremely foolish ’ by a former director of public prosecutions			1
last month the commissioner – who is expected to be given a knighthood in the @entity24 – said the officers had ‘ accurately reported what happened ’			2
authority : metropolitan police commissioner @entity2 has been dragged into the ' @entity29 ' row mr @entity8 , as he accepts , was wrong to have set such a bad example by swearing at the police but last night he was forced to issue a statement insisting that he would preside over a ‘ ruthless search for the truth ’ about the ‘ @entity29 ’ confrontation that led to mr @entity8 ’s resignation			1
a policeman involved in the @entity15 fracas was named yesterday in the @entity40 as @entity41			1
he is the officer believed to have written the official log of the incident			2
another policeman , diplomatic protection officer @entity44 , 52 , and a man believed to be his 23 - year - old nephew @entity46 have been arrested amid allegations that the officer posed as a member of the public in order to fabricate evidence against mr @entity8			1
@entity55 footage has also emerged which undermines the claims of the two officers at the gate that members of the public were ‘ visibly shocked ’ by the confrontation last september			2
a friend of mr @entity8 , senior @entity18 mp @entity63 , warned that unless the police answer key questions about the conspiracy they will demand that the @entity68 takes the inquiry out of the @entity71 ’s hands			1
allies of mr @entity8 are furious that mr @entity2 last week claimed the @entity55 did ‘ nothing ’ to challenge the claims of his officers			1
former director of public prosecutions @entity75 said the @entity71 boss was ‘ extremely foolish ’ and accused him of ‘ an arrogance of power ’			0
‘ what exactly does @entity2 consider is the purpose of having an inquiry into the men he has already exonerated on television ? ’ he asked			1
a chastened commissioner said : ‘ the allegations in relation to this case are extremely serious			2
' for the avoidance of doubt , i am determined there will be a ruthless search for the truth – no matter where the truth takes us			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman conceded that the @entity101 ’s most senior policeman now has an ‘ open mind ’ on the affair			1
but a senior @entity18 mp said many in the party had lost faith in the police			2
the mp said : ‘ there is widespread concern that @entity2 has completely compromised his ability to have anything to do with the investigation			2
he really is in trouble			0
’ @entity114 used a statement at the weekend to accuse the officers in the spotlight of lying			0
no 10 said : ‘ the prime minister has deep sympathy for @entity8 after allegations emerged that a serving police officer fabricated evidence against him			1
‘ the prime minister , and @entity8 , were deeply shocked to be informed that the police were investigating allegations that a serving police officer had lied about the events			1
’ @entity128 , who was police minister until september , warned against the ‘ cancer ’ of corruption in the force which ‘ should not be exaggerated , but must be cut out before it spreads ’			2
' blazing row ' : @entity55 footage , which emerged last week , cast doubt on police officer @entity41 's account of the ' @entity29 ' incident			1
the footage showed mr @entity41 ushering mr @entity8 out of a side gate at @entity15 but showed no evidence of a row investigation : the @entity40 named @entity41 , left , as the policeman at the centre of the ' @entity29 ' row and the man believed to have written the official police log into the incident			1
met police commissioner @entity2 , right , has returned from holiday to deal with the crisis defence : number 10 has defended prime minister @entity114 as having ' stood behind ' mr @entity8 following the ' @entity29 ' row after @entity8 's allies accused him of leaving the former chief whip ' swinging in the wind ' met police commissioner @entity2 's statement released this afternoon in full : ' the allegations in relation to this case are extremely serious			1
for the avoidance of doubt , i am determined there will be a ruthless search for the truth - no matter where the truth takes us			0
' this is shown not only by words but by action taken immediately following the receipt of new material earlier this month			0
this includes : ' my appointment of deputy assistant commissioner @entity177 , head of professional standards , to oversee the investigation			2
' the allocating of 30 police officers to the task to ensure the investigation is not only thorough but also swift			0
' within 48 hours of receiving new information , the arrest of an officer from the @entity187 on suspicion of @entity188 in a @entity189 , and a few days later a 23 - year - old man on suspicion of assisting in that endeavour			0
' the broad terms of reference allowing the investigation to develop where the evidence takes it			0
' there was an immediate referral to the @entity68 and we are committed to keeping them updated as the investigation develops			0
' i believe these actions are vital in maintaining public confidence in the police and @entity206 and her team have my full confidence to carry out a robust investigation			0
' during the last 24 hours i have taken the opportunity to satisfy myself about the welfare of the officers involved			0
media interest is to be expected , but for officers to be pursued and identified by the media during an ongoing investigation does , of course , create significant pressure			0
' i recognise that there is a great deal of public interest in these events			0
it is the investigating team who are in the best place to gather and assess all the evidence and it is vital that they are given the time and space to do this			0
