until now , researchers blamed the collapse of the @entity2 on widespread changes in global temperatures			1
but now experts believe the huge population collapse , that took place in around @entity8 , actually occurred two generations before this weather shift			1
records show that colder and wetter weather conditions were n't recorded until after the collapse - and social and economic pressures were more likely to blame			1
historians will have to find alternative explanations for the huge population collapse in around 800bc , because climate records show that colder and wetter weather conditions did n’t occur until two generations afterward			1
a stock image of snow covered @entity21 mountains near @entity22 is shown archaeologists and environmental scientists from the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 have shown that the changes in climate that scientists believed to coincide with the population fall , in fact occurred at least two generations later			2
their results , published in the journal @entity37 , show that human activity started to decline after @entity39 , and fell rapidly after @entity40 , indicating a population collapse			1
however , climate records reveal that icy conditions did n’t occur until around @entity44			0
fluctuations in levels of human activity at a given time are reflected by the numbers of radiocarbon dates for a certain period			0
the team used statistical techniques to analyse more than 2,000 radiocarbon dates , which they took from hundreds of archaeological sites in @entity56			2
from this , they were able to pinpoint the precise dates @entity61 ’s @entity2 population collapsed			0
experts from universities in @entity64 and @entity56 think social and economic pressures were primarily to blame for the population collapse , because when iron production took over , bronze trading networks failed			1
this caused widespread conflict and social collapse			1
a @entity2 spear head is pictured it has long been thought that climate change led to a dramatic decline in @entity2 populations in @entity8			0
but records show that colder and wetter weather conditions did n’t occur until two generations afterwards			1
experts believe that social and economic stress is more likely to be the cause of the sudden and widespread fall in numbers			1
communities producing bronze needed to trade over very large distances to obtain copper and tin and control of these networks enabled the growth of complex societies dominated by a warrior elite			2
as iron production took over , these networks collapsed , leading to widespread conflict and social collapse			1
the researchers then analysed climate records from peat bogs in @entity56 , and compared the archaeological data to these records to see if the dates tallied			2
this information was compared with evidence of climate change across @entity61 between @entity107 and @entity108			0
lead author @entity109 , professor of archaeology at @entity25 , said : ‘ our evidence shows definitively that the population decline in this period can not have been caused by climate change			0
’ dr @entity114 , associate professor of @entity115 at @entity26 , added : ‘ we found clear evidence for a rapid change in climate to much wetter conditions , which we were able to precisely pinpoint to @entity44 using statistical methods			0
’ professor @entity109 said social and economic stress is more likely to be the cause of the sudden and widespread fall in numbers			1

@entity144 in @entity145 ( pictured ) is thought to date to the @entity2 @entity146 , lecturer in the @entity147 at @entity27 , explained that the @entity2 is usually seen as a time of plenty , in contrast to an impoverished @entity151			0
‘ our results show that the rich @entity2 artefact record does not provide the full picture and that crisis began earlier than previously thought			0
’ professor @entity109 conceded : ‘ although climate change was not directly responsible for the collapse it is likely that the poor climatic conditions would have affected farming			0
‘ this would have been particularly difficult for vulnerable communities , preventing population recovery for several centuries			0
’ he said that in examining the past , humans are inclined to link evidence of climate change with evidence of population change			0
‘ actually , if you have high quality data and apply modern analytical techniques , you get a much clearer picture and start to see the real complexity of human / environment relationships in the past			0

cold and wet conditions occurred two generations after collapse in @entity40
experts from universities in @entity64 and @entity56 think social and economic pressures were primarily to blame - but harsh weather made it worse
when iron production took over , bronze trading networks failed
this caused widespread conflict and social collapse , the experts said
