by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:16 est , 4 february 2014 @entity3 : 11:21 est , 4 february 2014 @entity4 , a former deputy chief of staff to @entity6 gov. @entity5 who was fired in disgrace over allegedly politically motivated traffic lane closures , says through her lawyer that she will not obey a subpoena for documents related to the embarrassing episode			1
@entity4 has become the third @entity6 official to claim the protections of the @entity15 to the @entity16 , which protects citizens from being forced to incriminate themselves in legal proceedings			1
her lawyer wrote monday to the legislative panel handling an investigation in the state capital of @entity22 that @entity4 is clinging to her @entity15 right against self - incrimination , and to privacy rights enshrined in the @entity25			2
former @entity5 deputy chief of staff @entity4 ( r ) is the third person to cite @entity15 protections in refusing to provide investigators with information about the ' @entity31 ' scandal she ' respectfully will not produce the information demanded in the @entity36 's subpoena , ' attorney @entity32 wrote to @entity37 , the special counsel in charge of the probe			1
@entity37 made his name prosecuting former @entity42 gov. @entity41 , who is serving a 14 - year federal prison term for public corruption			0
' @entity15 's protections are not limited to verbal testimony , ' @entity32 insisted in the letter published online by the @entity48			2
he also claimed some of the committee 's subpoena demands were ' impermissibly overbroad ' and might violate her right to privacy			2
the attorney did not respond tuesday to a request for comment			0
emails that surfaced in january appeared to show @entity4 orchestrating the closure of lanes leading from @entity59 , @entity6 to the busy @entity60 , a commuter route into @entity62			1
' time for traffic problems in @entity59 , ' she wrote to @entity65 official @entity64 , who responded , ' got it			0
' @entity64 was the first official in the saga to cite the @entity15 , refusing to testify in a january 9 hearing			1
@entity64 's attorney wrote friday that his client claimed ' evidence exists ' showing @entity5 was inside the circle of people who knew about the lane closures when they were occurring			2
the governor 's office fired back with emails , circulated among friends and political allies , claiming ' @entity64 will do and say anything to save @entity64 , ' and slamming the @entity82 for first misreporting what @entity64 's lawyer wrote			1
the attorney , the @entity82 ' original story incorrectly claimed , had said ' that the governor knew about the lane closings when they were happening , and that he had the evidence to prove it			0
' that text was quietly changed hours later without any acknowledgement			0
the @entity6 legislature 's @entity36 on @entity95 said monday in a statement that it had begun to receive subpoenaed documents from some of the 18 people and two organizations that received the demands last month			0
@entity64 , a former @entity65 appointee of the governor 's , refused to testify during a january 9 hearing in @entity22 , @entity6 @entity105 , the political brain behind @entity5 's two successful gubernatorial elections , also refused on friday to turn over documents , citing the @entity15			1
@entity4 's decision hit the internet while gov. @entity5 was fielding questions during a regular ' ask the governor ' radio segment			1
' it does n’t tell me anything , ' he said about the decisions , three in all , to withhold information from investigators			0
@entity5 fielded questions from @entity122 on monday night during a regular radio segment as news broke that @entity4 would refuse to cooperate with a subpoena ' i would hope they would share any information they have that would let me get to the bottom of it , ' @entity5 said , while continuing to insist he had no knowledge of the ' @entity31 ' lane closures before they were put into place			1
' but on the other hand , they have constitutional rights like everybody else , and have the right to exercise them			0
there ’s nothing i can do about that			0
' @entity145 , a @entity146 state senator who co-chairs the committee investigating @entity5 's political orbit , told the @entity149 that ' it 's frustrating when we ’re trying to find the truth of the situation that started with the governor saying he was going to cooperate and urge others to do the same			1
' she and state assemblyman @entity156 , the committee 's other co-chair , said in a statement that they received @entity32 's letter			0
' we are reviewing it and considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena , ' they said			0
@entity4 ’s announcement came just days after one of her former underlings , @entity170 , resigned from @entity5 's office			1
@entity170 , the former director of @entity6 's @entity173 agency , left her job on friday but said in a statement that she had been considering the move since shortly after @entity5 won re-election in november			0
her lawyer said monday that @entity170 , who received one of the committee 's 20 subpoenas , would find it more and more difficult to leave as parallel investigations by the legislative committee and federal prosecutors gather steam .			2

@entity4 , the governor 's former deputy chief of staff , is refusing to turn over documents to a legislative committee
the decision *suggests* that her notes , emails , *calendars* and other *paperwork* might incriminate her
@entity5 's office is under fire over accusations that he orchestrated a political *revenge* plan to close road lanes in a @entity146 mayor 's town
the *september* closures *pinched* off traffic to the @entity60
@entity5 fired @entity4 in january , and now she 's the third former official to cite the @entity15 in refusing to cooperate with a subpoena
