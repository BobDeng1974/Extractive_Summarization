by @entity1 reporter jobless people are being offered a course on how to ' design your own tattoo ' - paid for by taxpayers			1
the free sessions on tattoo art paid for by the @entity12 - run @entity10 's anti-poverty programme was yesterday blasted as a ' waste of public money '			1
the skin ink sessions for the unemployed are described a ' free fun interactive course that will develop your artistic skills to be able to design tattoos for yourself and others '			1
but leading @entity41 - dem welsh assembly member @entity40 hit out at the tattoo courses - and said it shows the job - creation scheme is a flop			1
he said : ' it is difficult to see how this venture can be justified			0
' this important regeneration programme is not delivering what is expected of it and now we see it being reduced to fun tattoo design classes			0
' the @entity53 has spent around more than Â£ 200million on the @entity38 scheme over the last ten years - but did not disclose how much is spent on the tattoo course			2
mr @entity40 said : ' tens of millions of pounds have been spent on @entity38 over the last decade or so but what indicators that are available show that in employment , health and education terms this money has had little impact			0
' the government needs to revisit how they are spending this money so as to deliver the results we need in helping deprived communities back to work			2
' the tattoo sessions are being held for free at community centres in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity76 areas of @entity34 later this month			1
the six - hour course is part of a publicly - funded @entity38 scheme to help get people back to work it is aimed to ' support people to acquire the appropriate skills to become job - ready and gain sustainable employment			1
' a spokesman for communities and tackling poverty minister @entity88 hit back by dubbing the attack as ' snobbish and grossly misleading '			0
he said : ' @entity90 publicises the fact that it has found work for young people in this growing industry - is mr @entity40 complaining about these jobs ? ' ' the truth is he has seen one advert about one small project in one @entity38 area and run to the press without first making proper enquiries about the facts of the matter			2
' a spokesman for @entity34 council said : ' the " design your own tattoo " session should not be taken at face value			0
' it is carefully structured to help people develop confidence and important skills in areas such as communication , creative thinking and working with others			0
