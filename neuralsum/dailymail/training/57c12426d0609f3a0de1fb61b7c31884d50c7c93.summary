@entity0 has created a range of tyres that monitor the pressure of tyres and automatically inflates them using just a regulator and a tube inflating your tyres too much can cause them to tear , while not having enough pressure can lead to punctures and damage to the suspension			1
with this in mind , @entity0 has created tyres that monitor pressure , and automatically inflate using just a regulator and a tube			1
if the regulator senses the pressure dropping it opens a valve to let air in , and this pumps up the tyre to the correct pounds per square inch ( @entity27 )			1
all the components of the @entity30 system , including the pump , are contained within the tyre			0
correctly inflated tyres can save fuel as well as lead to carbon dioxide reductions , while increasing the life of the tyre			2
@entity39 - based @entity0 began developing the @entity40 ( @entity30 ) in 2011 and will now start testing the tyres on trucking fleets in the @entity43 and @entity44 over the next 18 months			1
‘ this is an important milestone in the development of @entity30 for the commercial trucking marketplace , ’ said @entity45 , @entity0 ’s chief technical officer			2
‘ the tyres equipped with @entity30 have performed well in testing , and we are pleased that so many of our fleet customers were eager to collaborate with us in the next phase of testing			2
’ the system uses a so - called peristaltic pump technology to automatically maintain tyre pressure			0
this pressure is programmed in before the tyres are fitted , and is based on the individual car or truck ’s psi			0
the system ( illustrated ) uses a so - called peristaltic pump technology to automatically maintain tyre pressure			0
an internal regulator senses when the pressure drops below the specified @entity27 , which then opens to allow air into the pumping tube			1
as the tyre rolls , it flattens the tube pushing air through the valve and into the tyre an internal regulator senses when the inflation pressure drops below the specified @entity27 , which then opens to allow air into the pumping tube			1

the @entity101 ’s @entity100 has given $ 1.5 million to help research , develop and test the @entity30 system for commercial vehicle tyres			0
according to @entity0 , tyre - related costs are the single largest maintenance item for commercial vehicle fleets			2
only 44 percent of all truck tyres are within five psi of their target pressure , and 7 per cent are underinflated by 20 psi or more			0
‘ the phase of [ @entity30 ] testing will go a long way in helping us determine when we can make this technology available in the commercial tyre marketplace , ’ continued mr @entity45			0
earlier this month , the company also a long haul drive tyre in @entity119 , called the @entity120 , designed to save fuel .			0
