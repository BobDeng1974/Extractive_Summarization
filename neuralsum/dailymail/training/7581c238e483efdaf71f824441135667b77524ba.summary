by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 26 may 2012 updated : 16:51 est , 26 may 2012 no one knows exactly why this magnificent 1920s racing car was carefully dismantled , piece by piece , and buried under a shed			1
but the amount of time and effort put into the job is likely to pale in comparison to the painstaking task of rebuilding it to its former glory			0
after having been laid to rest for potentially more than half a century , the 1928 @entity13 has not only been restored to its former grandeur but has also scooped the @entity16 award at the @entity17			0
the resurrected @entity13 , similar to this 1924 - 27 @entity13 , is the only survivor in the country that displays the correct coachwork it took @entity22 , from @entity23 in @entity24 , more than a year to piece together all the parts of the two - seater car			1
but almost everything he needed was there			0
' when it was found it was completely taken apart , laid out flat and covered in gravel and one or two inches of concrete , ' said car enthusiast body who bought the parts of the car when they were put up for sale			1
speculating on why it was buried in such as way , he told the @entity40 : ' i think what must have happened was the war was coming and someone thought ' they 're not taking my car for scrap '			1
' they carefully took it apart and buried it thinking they would come back and put it together again			0
' the vehicle was discovered in 1999 under a cowshed on a farm in @entity56			0
prior to this date , nobody knows anything about the car 's history , or its previous owner			1
the two - seater car , similar to this 1927 - 1929 @entity13 , was found in pieces under a cowshed in @entity56 only 135 examples of this model of @entity13 were made in 1928 , according to the @entity68 , and @entity70 's restored model is the only survivor in the country that displays the correct coachwork			1
despite spending most of its days underground , most of the parts were in good order			2
it even had all its identification including guarantee plate and original number plates			0
surprisingly , some of the original leather from the seats and paintwork was also preserved , meaning @entity70 could restore it as close as possible to its original colours			0
the only parts that did not survive were those made from aluminium , which had corroded			2
the instruments were also missing - the most difficult parts to find - which @entity70 speculated may be adorning someone 's fireplace			2
the @entity13 was completed early this year and won the vintage car award at the end of april			1
commenting on the @entity13 's resurrection , a spokesman for the @entity68 said it was one of only a few genuine @entity101 that have come to light in the last 25 years .			0

car enthusiast @entity22 spent more than a year piecing together the parts
