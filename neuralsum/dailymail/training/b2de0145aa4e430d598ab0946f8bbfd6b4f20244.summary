but with a name like @entity8 - @entity7 , and living in a @entity10 village called @entity11 , perhaps it 's no wonder she 's a spelling champion			1

she put her success down to her love of reading and writing , plus plenty of practice spelling her long @entity37 family name and her address in @entity10			1
' if you can spell my name you can spell just about anything , ' @entity8 said			1
' after learning to spell @entity37 names and @entity10 places , @entity43 is a doddle			1
' i do n't have lessons like children do at school , and i 've never compared myself to anyone before			2
so we were a bit shocked as i had no idea that i was good at spelling			1
' i had to spell correctly as many words as i could and as fast as i could in one hour			1
but i do type very fast , because i have learned to touch type			2

let 's face it , she has to check her spellings with a name like hers and living here			0
