by @entity1 reporter published : 18:42 est , 15 april 2012 updated : 03:41 est , 16 april 2012 president @entity2 said yesterday that ' of course i 'll be angry ' if allegations that @entity7 agents hired prostitutes are proven true by an investigation			1
@entity2 said the agents represent the @entity11 and are supposed to conduct themselves with the highest levels of dignity anywhere in the world			1
' obviously , what 's been reported does n't match up to those standards , ' @entity2 said in a news conference wrapping his appearance at a @entity20 summit			2
@entity2 's remarks came after rep @entity22 , claimed the scandal was likely not the first time members of the president 's protection team have invited prostitutes back to their rooms			1
luxury retreat : the 11 recalled @entity30 were staying at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 ' angry ' : president @entity2 briefly addressed the scandal at a press conference sunday , saying the agents did n't live up to their standards @entity22 , who heads the powerful @entity38 , believes the wild hotel party ahead of @entity2 's arrival for the @entity41 is evidence that the agency could be covering up other misdeeds in the ranks of @entity20 's most elite civil servants			1
and he hinted even more agents than the 11 recalled to @entity48 last week could be involved in this scandal			2
@entity2 blasted the agents accused of misconduct , saying : ' we are representing the people of the @entity11 , and when we travel to another country , i expect us to observe the highest standards			1

@entity22 said he has n't decided whether his committee would independently investigate the prostitution allegations			0
however , he said he planned to ' look over the shoulder ' of federal investigators			0
the allegations , which could have opened the agents up to blackmail , require the agency to do ' some soul - searching ' about its personnel are screened and trained			2
' things like this do n't happen once if they did n't happen before , ' he said on @entity92			0
' we think the number ( of agents involved ) might be higher , and we 're asking for the exact amount of all the people who were involved , ' he added			2
@entity22 , a @entity99 @entity98 , linked the agents ' misbehavior , which was n't illegal , with the @entity103 controversy , which saw employees of that agency spend $ 820,000 on a glitzy conference in @entity107			2

mr @entity66 said he was told that the agent did eventually pay the woman			0
the incident was reported to the @entity11 embassy , prompting further investigation			1
security breach : experts say the agents ' behavior could have endangered the president , though the @entity144 says that was never the case in the field : the agents were in @entity33 the week before president @entity2 's arrival to the @entity41 beachfront property : the @entity152 is a luxury resort that costs about $ 160 to $ 200 per night during their week - long stay at the five - star hotel in @entity32 , the agents were seen drinking heavily , according to waiters there			1

' the president does have full confidence in the @entity7 , ' presidential spokesman @entity167 said when asked			0
mr @entity167 insisted the matter was more a distraction for the media than mr @entity2			0
but @entity7 assistant director @entity171 said in a statement : ' we regret any distraction from the @entity41 this situation has caused			2
