@entity0 believes @entity1 have made a statement of intent by drafting in no fewer than nine new players this summer			1
the on - loan defender from @entity6 was one of many new faces at @entity8 , including the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
and the 22 - year - old right back says the ambition shown in the transfer market is one of the reasons he moved to @entity1 for the season from @entity6			1
arrival : @entity0 joined @entity1 on loan from @entity6 for the season he told whufc.com : ' we 've made some great signings and that was half the reason i joined			1
@entity27 is clearly making a big push this season and we 've signed some more players since i signed			2
i think that 's a real sign of intent			0
' hopefully the players we have brought in , along with myself , can do ourselves justice in a @entity1 shirt			0
' @entity0 , who met @entity1 fans at their store in @entity38 on tuesday , is looking forward to playing with former @entity6 midfielder @entity10 , who joined on a season - long loan from @entity40			1
in action : Â£ 12m new signing @entity11 playing against @entity43 ovation : @entity10 , who joined on loan from @entity40 , was paraded before the game against @entity43 ' @entity10 justifies the response he got at the stadium on saturday ( when he was unveiled ) because everybody knows how big a signing he is for the club , ' @entity0 said			1
' he has played for some of the biggest clubs in the world and you do n't do that through luck			0
' he is a top player and @entity1 have done very well to bring him in			0
me , as much as the rest of the boys and the fans , are very excited to have him on board because he 'll bring an awful lot to the side			0
' he has n't played regularly for a while now , so he needs to get his fitness up as he has said , but when he 's firing on all cylinders he 'll be a fantastic player for @entity1 , i 'm sure			0
' day out : @entity0 ( left ) , @entity67 ( centre ) and @entity69 ( right ) met fans in @entity38 @entity0 has missed @entity1 's first three @entity72 games after suffering a hamstring injury during a friendly against @entity75			2
but the young defender hopes to be fit in time for @entity1 's next game , at @entity78 on september 15			1
' fingers crossed , i should be back for the next game , ' @entity0 said			2
' it seems like a long time out , but i have only missed three league games , so it 's not been the end of the world			0
i 'll be back soon and hopefully i can do the business on the pitch			0
