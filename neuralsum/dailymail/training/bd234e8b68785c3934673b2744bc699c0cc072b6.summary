@entity0 , pictured here as a child , was a talented student who aspired to be a filmmaker a formerly bright student who suffered brain injuries in a car crash has been awarded $ 1.5 million in damages after a judge ruled that her injuries led to her working as a dominatrix			1
23 , aspired to be a filmmaker or actress and was in the top two per cent of her class before the august 2008 car crash , just before her final year of high school			1
witnesses say the @entity19 she was travelling in was speeding when it ran off a wet road into a ditch , ending up on its side near @entity24 , @entity25			0
the car was being driven by her mother 's boyfriend at the time , @entity30			0
@entity0 's brother , @entity32 , and mother , @entity34 , were also passengers			2
both @entity0 and her mother were injured			0
when she returned to school @entity0 showed no impulse control , had frequent outbursts , made sexually inappropriate comments , and found following through on tasks difficult			1
she became isolated and dropped out of high school to finish 12th grade at home			2
after briefly attending college , she began working as a dominatrix named @entity47			1
in court in january , justice @entity48 concluded that @entity30 was driving too fast in the wet road conditions and was therefore negligent			0
however , the case against @entity30 centered not on whether @entity0 ’s brain injury was a result of the crash , but on whether it caused such a change in personality that she ended up working as a dominatrix , unable to hold down other employment			1
her lawyers argued that her decision to go into sex work showed a lack of ‘ correct thinking ’ and that her cognitive function had been impaired leading her to undertake unnecessary risks			2
after the crash @entity66 , 23 , showed no impulse control , would make sexually inappropriate comments and suffered from outbursts			1
she became isolated and eventually began working as a dominatrix as a dominatrix @entity66 is known as @entity47 and has a heavy presence on social media			1
a judge ruled that her injuries in the crash had directly led to her inability to pursue her original academic and career goals @entity30 ’s lawyer argued that her work as a dominatrix proved she was able to organize herself and was able to maintain a modest level of income and employment			2
@entity86 concluded that there was some truth in both arguments concerning the link between the accident and @entity0 ’s sex work			0
he noted that as a dominatrix she was able to keep appointments , collect money , support herself and meet deadlines , all of which showed an ability to hold down a job			0
however , he also noted that she had not minimized the risks associated with her work and had not implemented an alarm system or other safety measures , which is evidence of diminished judgment supporting a theory of frontal lobe damage			0
@entity86 concluded that after the crash @entity66 struggled to cope in a normal way , and the brain injury stopped her from succeeding at her academic and employment goals			0
she is now only qualified and able to deal with entry level jobs for a few hours a day			0
without the injury , she could have completed college or university and been qualified for a better job			0
@entity66 was awarded $ 1.5 million in damages after a judge ruled that without her injuries she would not have struggled as she has and would have been able to complete college and get a job @entity66 was therefore awarded $ 825,000 for ‘ future capacity loss ’ , $ 376,000 for the cost of future care , $ 300,000 for pain and suffering , and $ 23,000 for special damages , totaling $ 1.5 million			1
a further claim for an inability to form relationships due to her isolation and sexual and general impulsivity – that she is ‘ damaged goods ’ – was dismissed due a lack of evidence			1
her mother , @entity34 , was also awarded $ 943,000 in damages for a mild traumatic brain injury sustained in the accident			1
the former employee of @entity146 will get $ 400,000 for future capacity loss , $ 195,000 for pain and suffering , $ 158,000 for past wage loss , $ 131,000 for cost of future care and $ 59,000 for special damages .			2
