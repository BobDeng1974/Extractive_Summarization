by @entity0 what better way to enjoy yourself on @entity3 than with a celebratory drink			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , @entity6 's resident @entity7 , did exactly that in their @entity11 enclosure on tuesday morning			1
the hybrid primates were given an array of warm herbal teas to get them through the miserable rainy morning , according to their keeper @entity16			1
' it 's not something @entity7 would normally get in the wild , but it 's just herbal , non-caffeinated tea and it ’s part of the enrichment program we have for them , to make sure they get a lot of different things out of each day			1
we give it to them more so in winter , ' ms @entity16 told @entity31			2
we have lots of different flavours for them and they love the raspberry tea the best , but chamomile and ginger too			0
' ms @entity16 went on to describe the practical joke that @entity8 , the 29 - year - old female @entity7 , recently played on her keeper , saying that like little children , ' they always try to push the boundaries '			1
' she 's incredibly intelligent			0
we run training sessions with them every day and as part of them we teach them to present different body parts to us which helps with medical treatment if they ever need it			0
' when i train , i use a target stick , so if i want @entity8 to give me her shoulder i put it on her shoulder and say ‘ " shoulder " , reinforce her good response with my food and then i slowly start moving the stick further away			2
' recently in a session , i asked for her shoulder and she gave me every other body part - her nose and her foot and her hand - and eventually she went and got a stick and came back and decided to target my shoulder , so she decided she was going to train me			2
' ' they love it			0

' they are facing a great threat from the palm oil industry , ' ms @entity16 said			0
' about 300 football fields worth of natural forests are being cut down every hour to plant palm oil and it ’s found in a lot of products , about 8 out of 10 products on supermarket shelves including chips and cookies right through to shampoos			0
' farmers like to clear the primary forest [ rather than re-planting ] because they can get money for the timber they clear – and unfortunately the animals that are found end up on the black market			0
' the greatest threat to @entity7 around the world is the unsustainable palm oil companies , which clears up to 300 football fields of their natural habitat every hour the @entity115 is considered ' critically endangered ' , with less than 6,600 left around the @entity117 species are also declining dramatically , with less than 54,000 left in the wild ms @entity16 recommended that @entity7 and other wildlife lovers encourage the use of sustainable palm oil and sustainable wood , while avoiding buying wooden products made with @entity125 @entity124 the devastating clearing of their natural habitat has led to the endangerment of the two @entity7 species , with the @entity115 being labelled at a ' critically endangered ' level with less than 6,600 left around the world			1
the @entity117 species are also declining dramatically , with less than 54,000 left in the wild			1
ms @entity16 recommended that @entity7 and other wildlife lovers encourage the use of sustainable palm oil and sustainable wood , while avoiding buying wooden products made with @entity125 teak			2
' another thing that we can do is to write to the government to try and get them to encourage companies to label their products if they 're using sustainable or non-sustainable palm oil , ' she said			0
' currently , palm oil can just be listed as a vegetable oil , so as consumers we do n’t have the right to make a conscious choice			0
