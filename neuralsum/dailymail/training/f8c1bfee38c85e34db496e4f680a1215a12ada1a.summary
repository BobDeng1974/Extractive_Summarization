twelve years ago @entity0 lit up @entity1 with a string of dazzling displays which should have seen him running out on saturday with 100 caps to his name			1
but @entity0 will never run again			1
he is not even sure how long he will be able to play with his kids in the garden			1
four shoulder operations , a shattered clavicle and four ankle surgeries since that memorable autumn of 2002 have finally done for the man they call @entity14			1
@entity0 , playing for @entity15 against the @entity16 in 2006 , was forced to retire this year the former rugby star says his retirement ' was like a bereavement ' and he will be unable to run ever again the last injury - a horrific fracture - dislocation of his left ankle sustained last november - forced him to call time on a brilliant , but ultimately unfulfilled , 13 - year professional career			1
‘ i still have n’t come to terms with it fully , ’ the 32 - year - old said			1
‘ i went through so much rehab and got so close but in the end every time i tried to run i got this hot sensation and just had to stop			1
i think i went to the pub after i was told to call it a day			2
the tears came randomly in the middle of the night a few days later			2
it felt like a bereavement			1
‘ day - to - day life i ’m all right			2
i can walk my dog			2
i can hopefully play with the kids in the garden			2
but in the morning and at night i ’ll be hobbling around , stiff and sore			2
if i have a long journey and have n’t really moved i ’ll be limpy			2
i ’m not going to be able to run again			1
’ the most naturally gifted player of his generation is n’t bitter			2
he enjoyed 13 years at @entity45 - playing 272 games - although he has ‘ many regrets ’ about an international career which eventually yielded only 10 caps			1
@entity50 played 272 games for @entity52 over 13 years at @entity45 in the @entity53 but he has joined a growing list of professionals forced to retire early through injury , and the severity of his last one is shocking , even by today ’s gladiatorial standards			1
‘ i remember @entity61 ( team - mate and friend @entity62 ) standing over me - he was probably thinking i should have passed the ball - but the oxygen was n’t working at the time			2
i could hear tins shouting , “ get the f * * * ing oxygen ”			2
‘ it was like a scene out of the film @entity70 when the quarterback gets wiped out and he ’s just tearing pieces of turf out of the ground			1
@entity50 , pictured against @entity78 in 2009 , was the most talented player of his generation ‘ i did n’t need to look down because i ’d felt everything			1
i ’d heard the ligaments pop and the bone snap			2
i could hear all their players murmuring about how bad it was			2
the bone had basically shattered and cut like a dagger through the muscle inside my leg			0
‘ i was so drugged up			0
i had about five days in hospital			0
i was transferred from the local @entity52 hospital to @entity91 in the back of a @entity93 in a morphine haze			1
every time the car moved i could feel the bone moving against itself from side to side			0
’ desperate for one more season at the top , @entity50 and @entity52 ’s medical team resorted to increasingly extreme measures to try to fix his ruined left ankle			1
the former @entity15 flyer poses with his dog @entity109 on the stairs of his @entity112 home @entity50 evades the challenge of @entity115 ' @entity114 during @entity15 's 43 - 9 win in august 2003 ‘ the final treatment i had was called @entity118 , which is used for cancer patients , ’ he said			1
‘ the idea is that they pump this stuff into your arm and it travels around your body and finds the damaged area of the bone and strengthens it			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s quite an aggressive treatment and one of the side - effects is you can get properly ill. on the train home i started having flu - like sweats			0
but when i woke up the next day my whole body was throbbing			0
‘ then i needed a month for the treatment to take maximum effect			0
i waited for a month , and even when i was lacing up my boots i thought i was going to be ok			0
i went out and ran , was n’t ok , and came back in a retired rugby player			0
’ @entity50 shone against a @entity16 side containing @entity142 at @entity1 in may 2002 if things had taken a different turn , @entity50 could have appeared against @entity145 at @entity1 on saturday as a veteran star with a @entity149 winner ’s medal			1
the talent was undisputed , but his body failed him too often in rugby ’s heavyweight arena			0
barely out of his teens , the former @entity156 schoolboy was drafted into @entity159 ’s squad in november 2002 following an eye - catching display in an uncapped international against @entity142 and the @entity16			0
a memorable moment of trickery , allied to searing pace and a magnificent step , left @entity142 floundering and @entity1 purring			1
the flyer glides past @entity142 , who attempts to tackle him , during the non-cap international at @entity1 a full international debut victory over the @entity173 followed , before a man - of - the - match display against @entity175 the following week confirmed @entity15 had unearthed a gem			1
a year after leaving school , @entity50 had hit the big time			1
‘ a few months earlier i ’d been at school playing “ @entity142 ’s @entity181 ” on the @entity182 , ’ he said			0
‘ then @entity159 told me i was playing against him			0
those two games were unbelievable			0
to beat the @entity173 and @entity175 in my first two matches for @entity15 in a team of legends : it was special			1
’ but just hours after the final whistle against @entity175 , it was confirmed the sickness he ’d felt in the lead - up to the game was actually glandular fever			0
he missed the following week ’s battle with @entity145 before a back injury set in and he failed to make the @entity149 cut by the narrowest of margins			0
he ( right ) part - owns racehorse @entity199 with former team - mates @entity62 and @entity202 ‘ i remember watching the final with my in - laws , ’ he said			0
‘ i cheered the boys on but when the final whistle went i had this gut - wrenching feeling			0
i knew how close i ’d come to being part of it			0
’ @entity50 does not know what he is going to do with the rest of his life			1
a part share in racehorse @entity199 with friends and former team - mates @entity62 and @entity216 is a fun distraction , but will not provide financial security for his young family			0
‘ i have to accept that there will never be anything out there that mirrors the sensation you get from rugby , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t know how i ’ll be remembered			0
people say i could have got more caps for @entity15			1
but at @entity52 they seem to like me so maybe i ’ll go down as one of the good players at @entity52			1
‘ apart from that it wo n’t be too long until no one knows my name			0
unless you ’re @entity235 people forget you pretty quickly			0
i ’ll be like every other player			0
’ @entity50 runs with the ball during @entity15 training in @entity240 back in may 2011			1

@entity0 broke on to the @entity15 scene 12 years ago
his dazzling displays at @entity1 saw him adored by @entity15 fans
but injuries ravaged his career and he was forced to retire this year
former @entity52 man says retiring was ' like a bereavement '
@entity50 will never be able to run again after horrendous injuries
