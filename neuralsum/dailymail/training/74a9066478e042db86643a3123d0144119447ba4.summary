' @entity0 ' : @entity1 , pictured today outside court , denied driving his black @entity3 while over the legal limit a close friend of prince @entity6 has claimed a drink driving charge against him could be invalid because of malfunctions in a police breathalyser machine			1
@entity1 , 32 , was pulled over in his £ 90,000 black @entity12 last year , and tests found that he was significantly over the legal alcohol limit			1
he is currently standing trial in @entity16 , which heard today that a reading showed the proportion of alcohol in mr @entity1 's breath was 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath			1
the legal limit is 35			1
but , despite the reading , and the testimony of officers who say his breath smelled of strong liquor on the night , mr @entity1 's lawyer has argued that the reading could have been wrong			1
he said that signals given off by radios held by nearby police officers , as well as those produced by @entity1 's own @entity34 , could have interfered with the intoximeter machine used in the police station			1
however , he was later contradicted by experts , and told the machine had been recently serviced			2
@entity1 had that night refused to give a breath sample at the side of the road after being pulled over near @entity42 , the @entity44 night club he runs			1
he was instead arrested and taken to a police station in @entity46 instead to undergo the test			1
giving evidence , pc @entity48 told the court he stopped @entity1 at around 1am on may 28 last year			1
he said : i noticed a black @entity3 pull out of a side road and travel down @entity54 towards @entity55			2
' the reason my attention was drawn to the vehicle was because in my opinion it seemed to accelerate at speed			2
' i decided to turn around and stop the vehicle and speak to the driver			0
' ' as i was speaking to him i could smell intoxicating liquor on the male 's breath			2
' i made a request for mr @entity1 to take part in a roadside breath test			2
i showed mr @entity1 the device , mr @entity1 said " i do n't want to "			2
' i said to my @entity1 " if you fail to provide a sample you 'll be arrested , are you refusing to provide a sample ? " supercar : @entity1 was pulled over while driving is @entity77 supercar			1
he is pictured above with the vehicle in 2013 ' mr @entity1 replied : " yes "			2
' ' i asked : " have you had an alcoholic drink in the last 20 minutes ? " ' he replied no. ' i asked : " have you had a cigarette in the last five minutes ? " ' he replied no '			2
' when i asked him to take the roadside breath test he replied : " i do n't want to "			0
@entity1 was taken to @entity84 where he gave a sample over the legal drink drive limit , around an hour after his arrest			1
he insists he only drank two bottles of beer that night			0
@entity90 , defending , said that @entity1 could be innocent despite the reading , as the breathalyser machine could have suffered errors in the recording that went unseen by officers			1
he told the court : ' i 'm going to suggest to you that there are certain error messages that can be produced on this device that only come up on the screen			0
famous friends : @entity1 poses at an upmarket book launch at @entity105 's @entity104 last april friends : prince @entity6 , left and @entity1 , right , watch a @entity107 rugby match together in 2002 ' they will not come up on a print out			1
is that news to you ? ' @entity112 , the custody sergeant who oversaw the two intoximeter tests , said ' yes ' , adding : ' i would only be guided by the print out			0
as the print out said no errors , i took that to mean no errors			0
' @entity120 said he only knew of four error messages that suggested the breathalyser machine may have given a faulty reading			1
but mr @entity90 said there were 13 - some of which only show up on the machine 's screen and are not contained in a printout			2
the officer said he knew ' how to log into it , work it and be guided by it ' but he said he was ' no expert ' on the number of error messages that exist			0
mr @entity90 also suggested that police radios and mobile phones were in use near the machine and may have interfered with the reading			1
he told the arresting officer pc @entity48 : ' i 'm going to suggest that your police radio was on your person and switched on			0
' royal favourite : @entity1 is pictured here with princess @entity148 inside @entity42 but the officer insisted it was n't , and told the court : ' my radio and phone are normally taken off me and placed on the custody desk before i approach the procedure			2
' i removed them myself			0
i placed them on the desk myself			0
' he admitted that there were other police officers in the adjacent custody room who would have had their radios on , but said he was n't sure what frequency they were tuned into			1
mr @entity90 also claimed that @entity1 still had his iphone in his pocket when the test was carried out			2
he said : ' his telephone was n't taken from him			0
when he came back to the desk he had to surrender his telephone			0
' i 'm suggesting that the defendant had his mobile phone on him during the procedure			0
' but the officer insisted the socialite had been searched , his pockets emptied and his mobile phone removed when he first got to @entity46 police station and before he was breathalysed			1
the coutr also heard how the machine was serviced and found to be in working order on march 4 2013 - just two and a half months before @entity1 used it			1
but @entity90 , defending , said he was ' challenging the reliability ' of the device			0
party pal : prince @entity6 and @entity1 pictured leaving @entity184 , in @entity185 , after a night out he said he had no actual evidence to prove that the machine was working perfectly			1
he said : ' the furthest i can go is to accept that the engineer went to check the calibration and the device			0
but i have no actual documentation saying it was fully operational			0
i do n't have any actual figures about how the machine was seen on that date			0
' pressed by district judge @entity198 on what the thrust of the defence case is , he added : ' i 'm challenging the reliability of the breath analysis on this occasion			0
that has always been our challenge			0
' @entity208 , an independent forensic alcohol consultant called by the prosecution , said there was no reason to doubt the machine 's findings - especially as a repeat reading had been taken			1
club owner : @entity1 with prince @entity218 's ex-girlfriend @entity217 at the launch of @entity42 branding the idea that it had misread @entity1 's alcohol levels twice as ' too incredible '			1
she said : ' for it to affect two independent specimens to the exact same extent is to be too incredible			0
' they are completely independent because they are two separate breath specimens			0
' these are two separate breath specimens being analysed by the same hardware and coming up with the same result			0
' @entity232 footage played to the court shows @entity1 being taken the station where he blew into an intoxicator machine , which measured the amount of alcohol in his system			1
he sat on a bench with his arms crossed after taking the test before being told to removed the laces from his shoes as he was put into a cell			0
the 32 - year - old denies the allegation			2
@entity1 owns @entity248 - @entity247 in @entity44 and has run celebrity hotspots @entity250 and @entity251 in the past			2
his grandmother , @entity253 , was a member of the @entity255 sugar dynasty and his friendship with @entity218 stems from their participation in the @entity259 - one of the oldest fox hunting packs in @entity261			0
he also organised prince @entity6 's stag party in @entity263 three years ago			1
his grandmother , @entity253 , was a member of the @entity255 sugar dynasty and his friendship with @entity218 stems from their participation in the @entity259			0
@entity1 , of @entity265 , southwest @entity105 , denies driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit			1

@entity1 , 32 , has known the prince for years and organised his stag do
he was pulled over in his black £ 90,000 black @entity77 by police
he refused to blow into a breathalyser during the *incident* in may last year
@entity1 was later tested at a police station and was above the legal limit
but his defence lawyer has argued that the machine gave a false reading
says officers ' radios and @entity1 's @entity34 could have interfered
but it the machine was serviced and *deemed* functional just months before
forensic alcohol expert said there was ' no reason ' to doubt machine
@entity1 denies the drink driving charge at @entity16
