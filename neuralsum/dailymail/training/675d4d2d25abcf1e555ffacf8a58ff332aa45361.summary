@entity0 faced an open @entity2 revolt last night after a senior party figure called for him to resign as leader			1
@entity5 , the former mp for @entity6 , said the party ’s dismal performance in last week ’s @entity11 by - election ‘ was not the performance of a government - in - waiting ’			1
writing in today ’s @entity13 , below , mr @entity5 says mr @entity0 ’s leadership is ‘ a complete disaster ’			1
he pleads : ‘ @entity0 – for the sake of the party we both love , please stand aside now			1
mr @entity30 spoke out after mr @entity31 dismissed his call for new policies to widen @entity2 ’s appeal			1
the @entity13 revealed last week how mr @entity30 had accused mr @entity0 of ‘ extraordinary complacency ’			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ normally when @entity30 talks about broadening the @entity2 coalition , he means broadening it to include @entity30			1
’ but yesterday , mr @entity30 hit back : ‘ the reason voters hold us in such low regard is because of patronising and condescending views like that			1
@entity0 has been warned that @entity2 voters are defecting to @entity29 over immigration concerns ‘ @entity29 ’s support is being driven by a vitriolic rejection of an arrogant @entity49 elite who think they know it all			1
this is the problem we have at the top of the @entity2			2
’ mr @entity54 , who took part in the @entity57 campaign , echoed mr @entity30 ’s criticism and said he was shocked by the hostility to @entity2 on the doorstep			1
‘ we came extremely close to losing the seat , ’ he said			2
‘ the ministerial bag - carriers who now run the @entity2 have no idea how to manage the bare - knuckle street - fighting which is @entity66 ’s speciality			1
‘ the seat nearly fell – and the @entity67 could be lost for the same reason – because we are not tackling people ’s feeling of unfairness over immigration and the effect it is having on schools , housing and hospitals			1
‘ the team around @entity0 have this aversion to even discussing immigration because they are so ideologically wedded to the @entity80 and its open borders policy			2
’ @entity0 was forced to withdraw his most recent party political broadcast over a copyright issue one northern @entity2 mp , speaking on condition of anonymity , said : ‘ if @entity0 cared to ask me , i could tell him why @entity29 is picking up votes in northern constituencies			1
it is because if a single mother with a child is in a queue for council housing , she will find that an @entity95 family with three children can jump ahead of her			0
‘ and if she goes to the local @entity98 , the same @entity95 families will have taken all the appointments			0
anyone who utters that kind of sentiment is denounced as a racist			0
it is nothing of the sort : it is the truth			0
’ sorry @entity0 , you 're a complete disaster as our leader ... so stand aside now ' says former mp @entity5 last week ’s by - election results confirmed what many of us in the @entity2 have been thinking for months – that @entity0 needs to step down as leader and make way for an election winner			1
it is not the performance of a @entity120 - in - waiting to scrape a majority of little more than 600 votes in @entity57 and @entity123 , a previously safe @entity2 seat			2
@entity0 is a decent , intelligent man			0
that is not in question			0
there is no gentle way of putting this but @entity0 's leadership of the @entity2 has been a disaster but – and there is no gentle way of putting this – his leadership is a complete disaster			1
yes , if we manage to stay at our current rating of around 35 per cent , then @entity0 may well become prime minister in may			0
however , recent history demonstrates that this can not be relied upon			0
in the 1980s , @entity2 leaders @entity143 and @entity144 were also ahead in the polls for much of their time , yet fell short			0
@entity0 ’s speech to the @entity2 conference last month , when he forgot to mention the deficit , was a train crash			1
my fear is that his fluff will join mr @entity143 ’s donkey jacket – when he wore a green coat while placing a wreath on the cenotaph in 1981 – as symbolic of a doomed leadership			2
likewise , when mr @entity144 fell over on @entity160 , clutching his wife @entity161 as he evaded a wave during the 1983 party conference , it became a metaphor for the electoral tsunami that was to come			0
both @entity144 , left and @entity143 , right , both seemed destined to win a general election for @entity2 despite their flaws , even @entity168 and @entity144 demonstrated qualities which @entity0 lacks			2
@entity144 bravely tackled @entity171 and @entity168 was one the greatest orators of all time			0
the reason they both lost to @entity176 was because voters could not imagine either man standing in front of no 10			0
@entity0 has the same problem			0
i am a traditional , old - fashioned politician who left school at 16 , worked for local council and began my political career in the unions			0
for 18 years as an mp , i represented the solid , working - class seat of @entity6 in @entity190			0
it is now held by the @entity192 on a wafer - thin majority from @entity2 , but could be vulnerable to @entity29			1
@entity195 , where @entity29 triumphed last week , is only 40 miles down the road			0
@entity0 will never appeal to floating voters in such vital marginal seats			2
he has surrounded himself with too many wet - behind - the - ears advisers and apparatchiks who have never done a real day ’s work in their lives			0
chief courtier in this dysfunctional set is @entity206 , who combines his role as shadow foreign secretary with heading our general election strategy team			0
@entity206 was heavily implicated in @entity212 ’s ‘ bottled ’ @entity211 of 2007 , ran @entity214 ’s failed leadership campaign and played a key role in the pro-union referendum campaign in @entity217 , which was floundering until @entity212 stepped in to save the day			1
and we are counting on him to deliver victory in 2015			0
of our elder statesmen , no - nonsense former home secretary @entity220 or plain - talking ex-chancellor @entity221 would both be better leaders than @entity0			2
and among younger @entity227 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 can all , unlike @entity0 , deliver crisp , cogent – and complete – speeches			2
@entity0 , for the sake of the party we both love , please stand aside now .			2

@entity233 *blasted* @entity0 as ' a complete disaster as leader '
@entity0 is under serious pressure from his party over @entity240 disaster
party *mps* fear @entity0 is *incapable* of *challenging* @entity29 's street fighters
mp @entity30 was *embroiled* in an extraordinary *public* *slanging* match with @entity31 , the party ’s *vice-chairman* .
another mp , @entity54 , said @entity2 could lose the @entity67 because mr @entity0 ’s team had no idea how to combat @entity66 ’s ‘ street - fighting ’ political *skills* .
a senior @entity2 mp said voters were defecting to @entity29 because they were *furious* at being *overtaken* by immigrants on housing waiting lists .
