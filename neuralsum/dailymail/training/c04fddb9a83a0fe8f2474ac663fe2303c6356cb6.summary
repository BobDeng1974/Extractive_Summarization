in a makeshift camp a few miles from the border in @entity4 's @entity3 , @entity0 sat in his tent where the dirt floor had turned to mud			1
strong winds blew snow in the entrance and children huddled in one corner around a fire in a metal crate			0
' the storm will finish us			0
i seek refugee in @entity22 , ' the 27 - year - old @entity19 refugee told @entity23			2
chill : a youngster braces against the cold at a camp for @entity19 refugees in @entity4 's @entity3 after the first winter snows fell this week , bringing fresh misery to the hundreds of thousands who have fled the war @entity19 refugees play with snow : this week 's storm , dubbed @entity35 , pushed temperatures below freezing in northern @entity4 and some areas of the @entity3 , which is dotted with informal refugee settlements ' this winter promises to be very harsh ' : @entity40 of the @entity41 high commissioner for refugees told the @entity42 that at least 80,000 @entity19 in @entity4 will spend the winter in tents the season 's first snow settled in parts of @entity4 this week , giving refugee children who have fled the war in @entity19 the opportunity for a snowball fight outside their tents			1
but , children 's games aside , the winter weather heaped another layer of misery on the already grim existence of many of the estimated one million @entity19 in @entity4 who have fled the civil war raging in their homeland			1
this week 's storm , dubbed @entity35 , pushed temperatures below freezing in northern @entity4 and some areas of the @entity3 , which is dotted with informal refugee settlements			1
' we are extremely concerned for the refugees this winter that promises to be very harsh , ' @entity40 of the @entity41 high commissioner for refugees told @entity42			1
since the @entity19 conflict began in march 2011 , more than two million @entity19 - at least half of them children - have fled the violence in their homeland to neighboring countries like @entity4 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
many will spend the winter in flimsy tents with often only a plastic sheet covering the ground			2
clearing the decks : in @entity4 , more that 835,000 refugees live in tented camps , unused buildings or with friends or family , according to @entity86 figures			1
the government estimates the true figure to be closer to 1million abandoned : unlike in @entity72 , @entity71 and @entity73 , the @entity4 government is not providing facilities or land to temporarily accommodate refugees despite the continuing influx , which has increased the population by 25 % @entity0 , who declined to give his last name , says his family does not have enough money for food or to build a sturdier shelter at the camp , which is home to around 1,000 of his compatriots			1
outside his tent , men filled bags with dirt to hold down tent shelters and placed car tires and bricks atop the flimsy wooden structures to prevent the wind from tearing them apart			0
elsewhere , in another nearby camp in @entity3 , around 200 @entity19 refugees live in huts and derelict buildings at the foot of a mountain			1
they are housed in structures walled with scrap wood and poles , with roofs of plastic sheeting held down with ropes and tyres ; they too are slowly freezing to death			0
@entity127 , a 25 - year - old business studies graduate living there , told @entity130 : ' we have no heating oil , few warm clothes			2
we have had to hunt for scraps of wood to keep us warm			0
it has been terrible in every way			0
' he said that he and his fellows had been able to find work as agricultural labourers in the summer months , harvesting vegetable crops			0
' when we picked potatoes , we kept the bad ones and stored them for winter , so we have something to eat when there is no work , ' he said			2
a man walks with a hammer after fixing plastic covers on tents : some @entity4 worry that if official camps are set up for the @entity19 refugees , they could become as established as those housing @entity155 since 1948 a @entity19 refugee tries to move a washing machine outside her tent to protect it from snowfall : so for now , aid agencies can help @entity19 with food , tents , blankets and clothes but they can not set up formal refugee camps in @entity4 , more than 835,000 refugees live in tented camps , unused buildings or with friends or family , according to figures from the @entity86			1
the government of the country of just 4.5million people estimates the numbers to be much higher , at around 1million			0
unlike in @entity72 , @entity71 and @entity73 , the @entity4 government is not providing facilities or land to temporarily accommodate refugees despite the continuing influx , which has effectively increased the population of the country by 25 per cent			1
many @entity19 in @entity4 live in appalling conditions , finding shelter in slums , tents and tin shacks strung with laundry lines and wedged between farmland outside towns and cities			1
in the capital , @entity191 , many @entity19 live in underground parking lots , under bridges and on old construction sites with no running water , sanitation , electricity or protection from @entity4 's sizzling summers and its freezing winters			1
the country has a troubled history of hosting refugees			2
@entity155 families who were forced from their homeland in 1948 by the newly established state of @entity208 still live in squalid refugee camps across @entity4			2
their presence was seen by some as disrupting @entity4 's delicate sectarian balance and a contributing factor in the 1975 to 1990 civil war that devastated the country			2
now some @entity4 worry that if official camps are set up for the latest flood of refugees from @entity19 , they too could become as established as those housing @entity155			1
so , for now , aid agencies can help the @entity19 newcomers with food , tents , blankets and clothes but they can not set up formal refugee camps			2
young @entity19 refugees build a snowman : @entity227 of @entity228 said the agency has been able to mobilise winter supplies for @entity19 in @entity231 but ' the needs will outstrip what we are able to provide ' smiling through hardship : the start of winter coincides with a polio vaccination campaign that seeks to vaccinate 750,000 children in @entity4 after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in eastern @entity19 in october a young @entity19 refugee girl carries a blanket : @entity4 minister for social affairs @entity243 said the government was ' trying its best ' and that the army had been called in to make refugee shelters ready for winter @entity0 , who arrived last week , said the aid is not sufficient for the new arrivals			1
' we came here in the winter but it would have been better if we had stayed in @entity19			1
at least if you die , you die in your own house , ' he said			0
in @entity256 , a @entity4 town near the border with @entity19 , refugees on wednesday were piling up extra layers of plastic bags and tarps supplied by the @entity86 in an effort to reinforce their tents			1
' i do n't know if this tent will hold up , it 's just a few flimsy pieces of metal holding it up , ' said @entity269 , eyeing his tent with worry			0
@entity269 , who only agreed to give his nickname , has lived in the settlement with about 40 other families since fleeing the @entity276 suburb of @entity277 five months ago with little more than the clothes on his back			0
ms @entity40 of the @entity86 said that at least 80,000 @entity19 in @entity4 will spend the winter in tents			1
with no end to the conflict in sight and dwindling international support to help @entity19 's neighbors cover the costs and burden of providing for influx , many of the refugees now worry about how they are going to survive the winter			1
' we used to be scared of wolves coming inside the tents at night , ' said @entity296 , a 45 - year - old refugee from the contested @entity276 suburb of @entity298			0
' now there 's so much more to worry about			0
... how will we survive the winter ? ' @entity227 , a spokesman for the @entity228 , said the agency has been able to mobilise winter supplies for @entity19 in @entity231 and elsewhere but ' the needs will outstrip what we and our partners are able to provide			1
' the start of winter coincides with a polio vaccination campaign that seeks to vaccinate 750,000 children in @entity4 after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in eastern @entity19 in october			1
' polio spreads through water and sewage , ' @entity227 said			0
' this is one the big dangers - overflowing drains			0
' chief of @entity4 's @entity318 , @entity319 , said that in past years , snow and rainfall had increased and temperatures decreased over december and into january			2
' we are still at the beginning of the season , ' he said			0
' we should have rain and cold periods during the next two months			0
' mr @entity319 said @entity35 will last until tomorrow night and that temperatures could plummet to minus - @entity329 in some mountainous areas of @entity4			2
minister for social affairs @entity243 said the government was ' trying its best ' and that the army had been called in to make refugee shelters ready for winter			0
he told @entity23 his main worry was that some refugees are living in a flood area near the @entity338			2
' @entity243 said he was trying to rehouse refugees near the river , which flooded during storms in january but that so far there was no place available			0
' it 's beyond our capacity , ' he said			0
' we tried mosques , we tried schools , we have tried everything			0
it will be a disaster			0
