@entity1 scientists believe they have identified a new and more virulent strain of @entity3			2
the subtype , known as 02 _ ag / a , is spreading rapidly and is now thought to account for more than 50 per cent of new hiv infections in @entity6			1
the virus was first seen in the city of @entity9 in 2006 and is thought to be the most virulent subtype of the virus in @entity1			1
@entity1 scientists believe they have identified a new and more virulent strain of @entity3			0
the subtype , known as 02 _ ag / a , is spreading rapidly			1
image shows mature hiv virus infection it was discovered by scientists at the @entity17 in @entity6 , the @entity18 reports			2
@entity19 , head of the retroviruses department at @entity21 , said 02 _ ag / a could spread through the population much more quickly than the current main @entity3 strain found in @entity1			1
the number of @entity3 positive people in @entity9 has jumped from 2,000 in 2007 to 15,000 in 2012 , according to @entity1 ’s @entity26 and 50 per cent of the new cases have been caused by 02 _ ag / @entity28 the newly identified subtype is not confined to @entity6 – cases have also been reported in @entity31 , in the south of @entity1 , and @entity33 and @entity34			1
@entity3 can be divided into two main types - @entity3 - 1 and @entity3 - 2			0
@entity3 - 1 is the more virulent of the two and is , therefore , responsible for the majority of cases			0
@entity3 - 1 can also be divided into subgroups and the newly discovered 02 _ ag / @entity40 is a subgroup of @entity3 - 1			1
all of the subgroups are transmitted from person to person through the same transmission methods - including unprotected sex and sharing needles - but some are easier to pass on than others			0
02 _ @entity40 is thought to be easier to transmit than some other subtypes			1
the virus was first seen in the city of @entity9 in 2006 and is thought to be the most virulent subtype of the virus in @entity1			1
it is now thought to account for more than 50 per cent of new hiv infections in @entity6 @entity58 figures show that the only regions where the number of @entity3 infections is increasing are @entity62 and @entity63 – 52 per cent of people with @entity3 in this area live in @entity1			1
this is believed to be partly because there is little awareness of @entity3 in many parts of @entity1 and because @entity1 school offer very little sex education			0
the number of new hiv infections globally has plummeted by a third since 2001 and more than halved among children , the @entity58 recently revealed			2
globally , 2.3 million people contracted the @entity78 virus last year - down 33 per cent from 2001 , while 260,000 children became infected - 52 per cent less than in 2001			0
‘ the annual number of new hiv infections continues to decline with especially sharp reductions in the number of children newly infected with @entity3 , ’ @entity81 executive director @entity80 said			2
last year , 1.6 million people died of @entity78 - related deaths , down from 1.8 million in 2011 and 2.3 million in 2005			0
the report showed that 9.7 million people in low and middle - income countries , the bulk of those infected , had access to @entity3 drugs last year , compared to only 1.3 million seven years earlier			0
while the hike is impressive , it falls short of a @entity58 target announced two years ago to reach 15 million people by 2015			0
some 35.3 million people were living with the virus last year - about 70 per cent of them in @entity101 - up from 30 million in 2001 .			0

the hiv subtype 02 _ ag / @entity40 is spreading rapidly and is now thought to account for more than 50 per cent of new hiv infections in @entity6
it is thought to be the most virulent subtype of the virus in @entity1
infections have also been reported in @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity34
