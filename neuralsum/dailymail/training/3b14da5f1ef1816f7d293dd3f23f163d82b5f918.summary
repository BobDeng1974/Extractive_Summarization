by @entity0 the @entity2 ‘ @entity3 ’ movement has been a surprising success in its home country , and the concept is now being taken across the pond			1
@entity8 has developed an international reputation for its series of ' @entity3 ' programmes , including a live - broadcast of a seven - hour train journey and the creation of a sweater , from sheep to knitted garment			1
@entity19 - based production company @entity18 , has bought the @entity21 rights to the concept and is set to start making ‘ ambiance shows ’ for the @entity21 audience this year			1
the @entity25 way : a @entity21 production company has bought the rights to @entity2 ' @entity3 ' which has seen shows such as a seven - hour broadcast of a train journey from @entity31 to @entity32 ( pictured ) , knitting tv and a live feed from a bird house @entity18 , which also makes @entity37 's @entity36 ' , are hoping to adapt the concept to reflect @entity21 past - times such as wildlife observing and cross-country travel , and hope to be premiering their first shows as early as this summer			1
‘ it does n’t compete for your attention , ' @entity42 of @entity18 said			2
' in a world where we have this many channels and every channel has a docu - soap about some outrageous personality who lives unapologetically and sort of yells at us , as television viewers ... this was just the opposite			0
' this one allows you to watch and just sit back and relax			0
not in a boring way but in a really " that ’s different " sort of way			0
it allows you to breathe			0
’ the @entity2 ‘ @entity3 ’ was born on state broadcaster @entity63 in 2009 with centenary of the @entity32 railway line			1
americanized ' @entity3 ' : @entity18 will now attempt to make their own versions of success concepts such as the 134 - hours journey of a @entity2 ship @entity71 pitched : @entity2 reality tv show @entity72 sees birds hang out in their coffee shop - themed bird feeder rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line , @entity63 instead decided to stick a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven - hour trip from @entity31 to @entity32 , interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme			1
remarkably , it was a roaring success , with 1.2 million viewers , nearly a quarter of the population of @entity8 , tuning in for at least part of the trip			0
since then , the network has broadcast a cruise journey , a fire being slowly built and burned , and more recently , the knitting of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came			2
earlier this month , the tax - funded channel began the online broadcast of @entity72 , a live stream of birds and squirrels hanging out in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop			2
the show is due to air until june 2014 , with the best action usually taking place during daylight hours			0
fans can watch live via @entity63 's website .			0
