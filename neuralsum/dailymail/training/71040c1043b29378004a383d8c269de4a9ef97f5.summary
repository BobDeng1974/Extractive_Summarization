it seems almost every day we are treated to another amazing image taken by astronauts on board the @entity5			1
but keeping track of all these images of @entity8 can be a challenge , especially when it comes to finding one observing a specific location			2
thankfully , an interactive map has the solution by lets you explore all the images taken at specific points across the world by astronauts on board the @entity5 @entity21 of the @entity22 in @entity23 has made an interactive space image map ( interactive module above )			1
the map compiles images from tweets sent by astronauts and cosmonauts on board the iss. each image is given a location tag and can be searched on the map by scrolling around the world clicking on an image will take you to the original tweet to see what they astronaut said , and it also shows the position of the @entity5 construction of the @entity5 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			2
it completes an orbit of @entity8 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,600 days , during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of @entity8 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
the map was created by @entity59 , @entity60 at the @entity22 of the @entity61 ( @entity61 )			1
it includes images posted to @entity64 by two astronauts and two cosmonauts currently on the space station during the @entity69 mission : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
and it also includes contributions from the general public , such as time - lapse videos and more , posted online			1
the map was created using mapping software @entity79 by @entity81			0
clicking on a location tag reveals the picture taken at that spot , in addition to providing a link to the original tweet			1
each location tag also contains the letter of the first name of the astronaut or cosmonaut who took the image for easy identification			1
on the map the current location of the @entity5 is also shown			1
@entity59 tells @entity97 he wanted to create the map ‘ to enable lots of people to see the world from @entity5 perspective over time - and not let a tweet slip by			1
’ he added that it is also ‘ an example of mapping pictures and videos for my students - so they can build similar maps with their topic areas			0
’ there are many different images to view on the map			2
this image over @entity115 was taken by @entity116 cosmonaut @entity73 on 23 august 2014 @entity117 astronaut @entity71 took this picture of @entity120 vortices on a volcano around @entity122 of @entity123 in june 2014 the astronauts are continuing their groundbreaking research on the @entity5 , with a new crew set to travel to the station next month , while @entity116 cosmonauts also completed a spacewalk last week			1
and recently @entity131 @entity130 took part in a live @entity133 to answer questions from people on @entity8			0
one included sir @entity136 , who asked : ‘ what do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years ’ time ? pioneers ? guides ? or the norm ? ’ @entity70 responded : ‘ my hope would be that in 50 years from now , space travellers will not only be professional agency astronauts , but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience i am having right now			2
‘ anyway , i hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away			0

@entity59 of the @entity22 in @entity23 has made an interactive space image map
the map compiles images from tweets sent by astronauts and cosmonauts on board the @entity5
each image is given a location tag and can be searched on the map by scrolling around the world
clicking on an image will take you to the original tweet to see what the astronaut or cosmonaut originally said
the map also shows the position of the @entity5 , and includes videos and tweets from *members* of the public
