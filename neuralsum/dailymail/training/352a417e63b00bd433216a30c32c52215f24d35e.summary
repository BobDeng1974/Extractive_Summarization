doctors said she would never be able to conceive naturally a woman who was told she would never give birth naturally after going through the menopause three decades early has told how she defied doctors to have a baby boy			1
@entity11 had begun trying for a baby when she was 24 , but within a year her hopes of a large family appeared cruelly dashed when she discovered her body had been undergoing the change since she was just 17			2
the healthcare assistant and her partner @entity18 , who are both now 31 , had gone to doctors after failing to conceive for a year			2
but they told her she would be unable to conceive naturally and she started a course of hormone replacement therapy			1
@entity3 said : ' when i went for the tests i just thought that at worst my body was being a bit slow and they ’d prescribe me fertility drugs to make it happen a bit quicker			1
' when they told me i was going through the menopause i went into shock			2
i was sure they must have had my results mixed up with an older lady			2
how could i be going through the menopause , i was only 25 ? ' i looked over at my partner and saw tears in his eyes and realised what it meant – that we would never be able to have kids			2
' @entity3 had always dreamed of having a large family with her partner , who she met ten years ago			1
confident that she would quickly get pregnant after coming off the pill when she was 24 , @entity3 allowed herself to start picking names			1
but after a year of trying she visited her gp			2
when he asked her about her cycle she told him her periods had always been irregular and he arranged blood tests			2
days later the results were back and showed @entity3 ’s hormone levels were lower than expected			1
a little anxious , the couple thought it would n’t take much to sort out			0
but the truth was far worse			0
after hospital tests , their consultant broke the news that @entity3 was one of a small percentage of women to start the menopause early			1
he estimated she may have been as young as 17 when it began			0
' it was like our whole future had been ripped away			0
i was mourning for the life i thought i would have – full of kids			0
i felt like i was letting @entity73 down , too , ' @entity3 said			1
it was explained their only real hope lay in egg donation			0
@entity3 was five - months pregnant before the couple relalised ' in sheer panic i sat my younger sister down and asked if she would consider donating her eggs , ' @entity3 said			1
' i cried when she said she would and paid for us to see a private fertility expert			0
they gave us lots of different scenarios to consider – for example , what if she gave me some eggs and was then unable to fall pregnant ? ' it made me realise it was n’t something we could rush into			0
my sister was only 20 and i did n’t want to pressure her			0
' but as the weeks passed , depression set in			0
' everywhere i looked there seemed to be pregnant women and babies , ' recalls @entity3			1
' @entity73 was brilliant but it was tough			0
' then in november 2007 she saw alternative therapist @entity100 after a friend recommended him			1
mr @entity100 explained that he would try to alter the way she thought about pregnancy in the hope her body would follow suit			0
he told her to visualise herself conceiving , being pregnant and finally giving birth			2
' after the session i felt hugely relaxed , ' @entity3 said			1
' i ’d really enjoyed it and left feeling positive for the first time in ages			0
i did n’t think i would get pregnant , but i felt better			0
' @entity3 and @entity73 before she fell pregnant ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) just after he was born then seven months later in july 2008 she and @entity73 went on holiday where she complained about feeling bloated			1
she said : ' i put it down to the side effects of the @entity118			0
i also thought i might be constipated after rubbish on holiday			0
' but then the couple began wondering whether @entity3 could be pregnant - and dashed to the supermarket to buy a test			1
' i was shaking when the line turned blue , ' said @entity3			1
when they returned home @entity3 saw her gp			1
' i lay down and he started examining me			0
then he gave me the biggest smile and said " congratulations " , ' she said			0
happy family : @entity3 and @entity73 with @entity4			1
they said they were still hopeful about having another child he estimated she was already five months pregnant , and had conceived about two months after having alternative therapy			2
@entity3 stopped taking @entity118 and just 16 weeks later in december 2008 gave birth to @entity4			1
he is now a boisterous three - year - old			0
' holding him for the first time was the best moment of my life , ' she said			0
after the birth , @entity3 was put back on @entity118 and she says that if she and @entity73 decide to try for another baby she ’ll be making an appointment with @entity146			1
' i do n’t know what he did , but i felt instantly better and a few months later i was pregnant after being told it was impossible			2
however it happened , i ’m so lucky it did , ' she said .			0

@entity3 was devastated when she was told she could *n't* have children as she had dreamed of having a big family
she *credits* alternative therapist will helping her conceive
