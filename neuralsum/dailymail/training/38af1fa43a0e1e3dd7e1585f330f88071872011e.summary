anthropologists have long puzzled over how much contact @entity1 had with modern humans and when this may have occured			1
now , a genome taken from a 36,000 - year - old skeleton has shed new light on the period of interbreeding between the two species			1
the study of @entity12 recovered from a fossil of one of the earliest known @entity15 - a man who lived in @entity16 - shows that the genes of the earliest inhabitants of the continent survived the @entity20 , helping sow the seed for the modern - day population			1
a genome taken from a 36,000 - year - old skeleton ( skull pictured ) has shed new light on the period of interbreeding between @entity1 and humans			1
the study of @entity12 shows that the genes of the earliest inhabitants of the continent survived the @entity20 , helping sow the seed for the modern - day population the @entity32 genome revealed a small percentage of @entity1 genes , confirming previous results that found neanderthals and the first humans to leave @entity38 for @entity15 , briefly interbred			1
even today , everyone with @entity44 ancestry - from @entity41 to @entity42 and @entity43 - has a small element of @entity1 dna			0
but despite @entity48 going on to share the @entity15 landmass with @entity1 for another 10,000 years , no further periods of interbreeding occurred , the study claims			1
professor @entity51 , of the @entity52 , questioned whether @entity1 populations dwindled fast and how late modern humans encountered them			1
‘ we were originally surprised to discover there had been interbreeding			0
now the question is , why so little ? ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s an extraordinary finding that we do n’t understand yet			0
’ the @entity32 genome revealed a small percentage of @entity1 genes confirming previous findings that found @entity1 ( illustrated ) and the first humans to leave @entity38 for @entity15 briefly interbred			1
experts think this happened approximately 54,000 years ago it is commonly thought that @entity1 died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources			1
a recent study by the @entity69 suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred			2
experts believe that @entity1 ‘ may have survived in dwindling pockets of @entity15 ’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct , instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans			1
the study did n’t cover eastern regions such as @entity77 and @entity78 , where @entity1 are also known to have lived			0
‘ so it is still possible @entity1 lingered later in some areas , ’ professor @entity79 said			0
‘ overall pattern seems clear - the @entity1 had largely , and perhaps entirely , vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago			2
’ lead author dr @entity84 , an evolutionary biologist of the @entity85 at @entity86 , said the work revealed the complex web of population relationships in the past			0
he believes the study has revealed a firm framework with which to explore how humans responded to climate change , encounters with other populations , and the dynamic landscapes of the @entity20 , for the first time			1
anthropologists now believe that @entity44 separated into at least three populations earlier than 36,000 years ago			2
all the decedents of @entity48 , @entity101 and a mystery third lineage , developed the unique features of most non-african peoples - but not before some interbreeding with @entity1 took place			2
the new study allows scientists to more accurately estimate when this occurred - around 54,000 years ago - before the @entity44 population began to separate			1
the ancient man ’s complete genome is the second oldest modern human genome ever sequenced			0
by cross-referencing it with previous research , the team discovered a surprising unity running from the first modern humans in @entity15			0
they believe that a ‘ meta - population ’ of hunter - gatherers with deep shared ancestry managed to survive through the last @entity20 and colonise the landmass of @entity15 for more than 30,000 years			2
the study of dna used in the study was recovered from a fossil of one of the earliest known @entity15 - a man who lived in @entity32 , in western @entity16 ( marked on the map ) even today , anyone with @entity44 ancestry - from @entity41 to @entity42 and @entity43 - have a small element of @entity1 dna			1
a sequenced human genome with rows of protein data is pictured while the communities within this population expanded , mixed and fragmented , this was a ‘ reshuffling of the same genetic deck ’ , the researchers explained			0
@entity15 populations as a whole maintained the same genetic thread from their earliest establishment out of @entity38 until @entity148 populations arrived in the last 8,000 years , bringing with them agriculture and lighter skin colour			2
@entity151 , from @entity52 ’s @entity152 , said : ‘ that there was continuity from the earliest @entity155 to the @entity156 , across a major glaciation , is a great insight into the evolutionary processes underlying human success			0
‘ for 30,000 years , ice sheets came and went , at one point covering two - thirds of @entity15			0
‘ old cultures died and new ones emerged - such as the @entity166 and the @entity167 - over thousands of years , and the hunter - gatherer populations ebbed and flowed			0
‘ but we now know that no new sets of genes are coming in : these changes in survival and cultural kit are overlaid on the same biological background			0
‘ it is only when farmers from the @entity178 arrived about 8,000 years ago that the structure of the @entity15 population changed significantly			2

genome was taken from a 36,000 - year - old skeleton found in @entity16
@entity12 recovered shows the genes of the earliest inhabitants of @entity15 survived the @entity20 and shaped the modern population of the continent
anthropologists from @entity52 and @entity86 say study shed light on interbreeding between @entity1 and humans
they believe interbreeding occurred approximately 54,000 years ago
experts say study reveals a framework to explore how humans responded to climate change , the @entity20 and encounters with other populations
