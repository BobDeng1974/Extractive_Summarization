by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 10:50 est , 31 december 2012 a 17 - year old high school student has been suspended for a poem she wrote about the mass shooting at @entity4			1
@entity5 wrote the poem in a personal notebook about @entity8 and what she felt were his reasons for the mass murder at the @entity13 school earlier this month			1
on december 14 , crazed @entity8 gunned down 20 students , aged just six and seven , and six adults in one of the worst school shootings in @entity19 history			1
i know why he pulled the trigger , ' wrote @entity5 in a poem action : the @entity29 , a 60 - pupil vocational school for students , suspended @entity5 after reading the poem he was armed with a high - powered rifle , similar to that used by @entity19 soldiers , two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition			1
many of his victims were shot several times			2
authorities say he killed himself and also killed his mother at their home			2
killer : @entity8 gunned down 20 students , aged just six and seven , in one of the worst school shootings in @entity19 history			1
many of his victims were shot several times the close - knit community of @entity52 is still struggling to come to terms with the scale of tragedy and to understand what could have led to the brutal rampage			1
@entity5 , who writes ' all types ' of poetry to express herself , told today that she was just trying to express ' her belief that tragedies in @entity4 happen because people feel helpless			1
' but the contents of the poem prompted the school officials at the @entity29 on @entity66 , @entity67 , to suspend her			1
' i understand the killings in @entity13			1
i know why he pulled the trigger , ' wrote @entity5			1
' why are we oppressed by a dysfunctional community of haters and blamers ? ' the poem was found in a personal notebook of @entity5 's by a teacher , reported @entity80			1
@entity5 attends @entity13 's @entity29 , a 60 - pupil vocational school that prides itself on being able to help students who have not been able to settle at other establishments			1
she says in the past she has handed in poems dealing with dark issues and has not experienced any problems			2
her poems are a therapeutic way of expressing herself , explained the student , and should not be over-analysed			2
' for example , the only person i can think of would be like @entity92			2
he writes weird stuff all the time			2
that does n't mean he 's gon na do it or act it out , ' said @entity97			0
' i feel like they 're over reacting			0
why ? because my daughter does n't have a history of violence			0
she did n't threaten anybody			0
she did n't threaten herself			0
she simply said she understood why , ' said her mother , @entity103			0
outraged : ' i feel like they 're over reacting			0
why ? because my daughter does n't have a history of violence			0
she did n't threaten anybody , ' said her mother , @entity103 , left they wan na hold me back i run but still they still attack my innocence , i wo n't get back i used to smile they took my kindness for weakness the silence the world will never get i understand the killing in @entity13 i know why he pulled the trigger the government is a shame @entity121 never wants to take the blame society puts these thoughts in our head misery loves company if i ca n't be loved no one can the @entity130 are currently deciding about @entity5 's future at the school and if she poses genuine threat to the safety to her fellow students			1
but for now , she is suspended until further notice			2
the massacre , which president @entity138 yesterday described as ' the worst day of my presidency ' , has prompted a look into new gun controls and banning assault rifles such as @entity143 used by @entity8 in his rampage			0
the @entity145 has resisted those efforts vociferously , arguing instead that schools should have armed guards for protection			0
@entity138 's comments come as the schoolroom shooting has elevated the issue of gun violence to the forefront of public attention			0
' i am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools , ' @entity138 said			0
' and i think the vast majority of the @entity19 people are skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem			0
' visit @entity163 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy			0

@entity5 wrote the poem about the tragedy as a ' therapeutic exercise '
' i understand the killings *...* i know why he pulled the trigger , ' it reads
poem was later found by a teacher who handed it to the school principal
*concerned* school officials have suspend her until further notice
