by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 06:37 est , 14 june 2012 a federal agency charged with preventing the spread of infectious diseases has come under attack for ' serious ' airflow problems in one of their buildings that houses anthrax , @entity10 and monkeypox			2
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) works to develop disease prevention and control , with particular focus on infectious diseases			1
but despite harbouring lethal airborne gases new documents reveal that their building in @entity20 has a poorly engineered airflow system which could expose unprotected staff and visitors to dangerous pathogens			1
concern : the @entity12 were accused of having serious airflow problems in one of their buildings housing infectious diseases on february 16 safety inspector @entity30 sent an email to a top @entity12 official which said : ' as the door closed a very noticeable puff of air could be felt coming through the slit in the window out into the " clean corridor "			1
' @entity39 : caused by the bacterium @entity41 and transported through spores , anthrax causes respiratory infection in humans			0
it starts with cold or flu - like symptoms which last for several days , followed by fatal respiratory collapse			0
@entity10 : severe acute respiratory syndrome is another respiratory disease in humans , caused by the @entity10 coronavirus			0
resembling severe flu the virus killed 916 people between november 2002 and july 2003			0
@entity56 : this exotic infectious disease causes symptoms similar to small pox			0
monkeypox can be transmitted to humans from infected animals and cases occur primarily in remote villages of @entity65 and @entity66 in proximity to tropical rainforests			0
under biosafety regulations imposed by the @entity12 itself labs housing the most dangerous ' inhalable ' infectious gases must be maintained under negative pressure			1
meaning that pressure inside the room should always be less than that on the outside - ensuring that no toxic air will flow out			0
dr @entity77 , former head of the @entity78 and @entity79 , said airflow systems serve as a final safeguard keeping dangerous germs confined to labs			2
worryingly the revelations about inadequate airflow are just the latest in a long history of botched safety procedures at the $ 214 million infectious diseases laboratory in @entity20			1
in 2007 backup generators failed to keep airflow systems working during a power outage reports @entity91			2
while in 2008 the door to the lab housing @entity93 - a bacterium which causes the life - threatening q - fever - was found to be sealed with duct tape			1
nine workers were tested for the bacterium , which causes the fever , but none were infected			0
shocking : in 2008 a door to the lab housing a deadly bacterium was found to be sealed with duct tape ( picture posed by model ) congressman @entity108 said : ' this is yet another incident that calls into question @entity12 's self - inspection policy			1
' and dr @entity77 added that the airflow issue and the failure of the @entity12 to respond quickly highlighted the problems with self - inspection			1
the @entity12 did not immediately respond to requests for comment .			2

the @entity12 were found to have serious airflow issues at their building in @entity20
revelations come after news that one lab was sealed with duct tape
