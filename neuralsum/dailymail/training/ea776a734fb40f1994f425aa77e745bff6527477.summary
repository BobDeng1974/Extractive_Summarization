@entity1 midfielder @entity0 was full of praise for @entity4 captain @entity3 , describing facing him as ' always a pleasure and an honour '			1
speaking after @entity1 's 2 - 1 win over @entity4 in @entity10 , the @entity8 star compared @entity3 to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , as well as @entity4 team - mate @entity14			1
the @entity16 hard - man also had a pop at team - mate and match - winner @entity19 , saying the former @entity21 striker would score three times the number of goals if he made the right movements			1
' it always gets me emotional , i wo n’t deny it			0
' of course , on the field you ’ve got to get stuck in there , but it is always a pleasure and an honour			0
he ’s also a very nice guy , always very approachable			2
' i cheered on @entity47 until the end , but they lost the @entity50 title in an incredible way			0
' players like @entity3 , @entity11 , @entity14 , @entity12 or @entity13 never go past the apex of their careers			0
' @entity0 was less kind about @entity19 , who scored the goal which beat @entity4 in @entity57 on saturday night			1
' @entity19 is a player with great quality and his goal was scored with the movement of a real hitman			2
just the one : @entity19 scored the crucial goal in @entity10 but @entity0 thinks he is capable of even more getting stuck in : @entity0 went in two - footed on @entity64 , but escaped without a card warning : the @entity8 midfielder has a tattoo of a tackle on his leg , and put his foot in against @entity4 ' he has the quality of the greatest strikers , but sometimes does n’t move the way they do			1
this is a problem for him , as he ’d score triple the goals if he made the right movements			1
' @entity19 is starting to understand that now , as his teammates and the coach help him			2
you can see he is beginning to mature tactically			0
' in my view if @entity19 learned to run into space and stretch out the team , he ’d become unstoppable , because physically there are no defenders who can hold him			2
' @entity1 are second in @entity89 behind @entity90 , who shocked @entity92 on saturday			0
the two sides meet in @entity94 on friday , with a win virtually guaranteeing progress to the knock - out stages .			0

@entity8 midfielder says it was ' emotional ' to face @entity4 skipper
' he 's also a nice guy ' adds @entity0
@entity19 ' would score triple the goals ' if he *improved* his movement
