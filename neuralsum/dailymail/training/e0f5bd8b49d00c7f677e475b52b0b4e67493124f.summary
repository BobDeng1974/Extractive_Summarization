dozing in a mother 's lap , eyes half - closed , or throwing their arms around a father 's shoulders in a great hug — every child craves a parent 's affection			2
for @entity12 the lioness , it is no different			1
@entity16 , in this case , her parent is a human			2
@entity18 , 27 , co ‑ founder of the @entity19 in the @entity20 , @entity21 , has his hands full with the three - year - old lioness he has raised almost from birth			1
now a teenager in lion years , @entity12 is preparing to live in the wild — and surrogate parent @entity28 is teaching her to hunt			1
two of the babies died and the third was abandoned by the adults			0
working with a vet , @entity28 put the tiny animal , weighing just 4lb , on a drip to combat severe dehydration			0
over the next few days , he experimented with a recipe to fatten her up , until he hit upon a mixture of fresh eggs , cream , milk , vitamins , sunflower oil and calcium			0
' to this day we believe she is probably the most spoiled and well - fed lion in @entity21 , ' he laughs			1
within a year , she had put on 175lb , was weaned and was eating raw meat			2
@entity28 , born in @entity36 , and his fellow conservationist , @entity68 from @entity69 , were determined to help @entity71 return to the wild , and have been coaching her to hunt			1
that meant hours spent teaching her to stalk and kill — skills which are not wholly instinctive and which cubs typically learn from the adults in their pride			0
' we did n't want @entity12 to become like other lions in captivity , constantly fed by streams of tourists , ' says @entity68			1
' she hunts her own food , taking antelopes , and she will let us be near her when she eats it , which is remarkable			0
' we want to release her eventually as a wild lion , not as one who has met lots of people			2
she only interacts with me and @entity28			0
' best buds : @entity18 , 27 , raised @entity12 after she was abandoned by her pride new challenge : a documentary series follows @entity12 and mr @entity18 as he teaches her how to hunt realising that they were developing a unique bond with @entity71 , the two naturalists invited filmmaker @entity101 in , and a six part series called @entity103 will be released later this year			1
the film shows how @entity12 nuzzles and even hugs her human ' parents ' , and will allow them to scratch her tummy or rub her jaws			1
she keeps her claws sheathed during play sessions and lies with her head contentedly on @entity28 's lap while he strokes her ears			0
most of us can only imagine the thrill of raising a lion from a cub			1
but @entity119 , senior curator of animals at @entity122 , and his team have shared a similar experience over the past two years			0
as @entity12 does not have a pride to teach her how to hunt , mr @entity18 has to get down and dirty and show her in order to teach her how to live as a wild lion , mr @entity18 has spent many hours crouching in scrubland or pouncing in watering holes alongside @entity12 success ? a proud @entity12 managed to catch a large swollen toad , and carried it in her mouth the zoo 's pair of endangered @entity137 lions had twin cubs , called @entity139 and @entity140 , in november 2012			1
but the mother rejected them when they were just 13 days old after her mate died			0
' we do n't carry out hand - rearing unless there 's a strong reason , ' emphasises @entity119			2
' if the babies have been with their mother for a while , it is quite a challenge to get them used to artificial milk and teats , as they are obviously used to suckling naturally			0
' lions reared by humans will treat them as part of their pride , he says			0
many readers will remember the story of @entity161 , who bought a lion cub in the pet department at @entity164 in 1969 with his friend @entity165 , and raised it in his flat above a shop on the fashionable @entity168 in @entity169			1
as one : mr @entity18 is fulfilling a lifelong ambition by living with lions in the wilds of @entity174 family : mr @entity18 observes as a veterinarian cares for his beloved lioness friend the new documentary has been called an ' extraordinary story that transcends all known borders between man and lion , predator and prey ' by its makers sustainable living : a team from the @entity19 feed a group of young male lions in an enclosure when the cub , who they called @entity195 , outgrew the flat , they arranged , with the help of conservations , to introduce him to the wild in @entity200			1
when @entity119 and @entity165 returned to @entity200 a year later , @entity195 recognised them instantly , putting his paws on their shoulders in rapturous excitement			2
the footage subsequently became an internet sensation when it was posted on @entity207 in 2008			0
it has since been watched more than 100 million times			0
perhaps the extraordinary bond between @entity12 and her surrogate parents @entity28 and @entity68 will prove as touchingly enduring .			2

video of lion hugging her conservationist carer went viral last year
@entity12 was saved as a cub by 27 - year - old @entity18
new documentary follows pair as mr @entity18 teaches @entity12 to hunt
