he had survived the perilous flight back from @entity3 - occupied territory hundreds of miles away			1
exhausted , the @entity5 ‘ spy ’ pigeon swooped down on a chimney in @entity8 for a rest			1
and there , sadly , he fell off his perch			2
perhaps overcome by fumes from the fire below , he died – with a vital coded message in a tiny capsule still strapped to his leg			1
shock : @entity18 with the remains of a carrier pigeon which he discovered behind his fireplace his remains lay undiscovered in the chimney for around 70 years until the home ’s current owner @entity18 recently decided to restore the fireplace			1
‘ the chimney was full of twigs and rubbish , ’ he said yesterday			2
‘ we were stunned by how much came out			2
then i started finding bits of a dead pigeon			2
we thought it might be a racing pigeon until we spotted the red capsule			1
’ the former probation officer and his wife @entity36 , both 74 , unscrewed the capsule and found a hand - written message inside on a ‘ cigarette paper thin ’ piece of paper			1
it has been sent to code breakers at @entity44 in @entity45 , the intelligence centre where work to crack the @entity49 code shortened the war by years , and to their modern - day counterparts at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , who also are trying to decipher it			1
history : historians believe the message , ( left ) which was written by a sergeant @entity62 , will provide unique insight into the war			0
it was discovered rolled up in the red capsule attached to the pigeon ( right ) complex : the message contains 27 codes , each made up of combinations of five numbers and letters the bird could have been on its way to wartime decoding hq @entity44 , in @entity45 ( pictured )			1
code - crackers are now frantically trying to decipher the message , which never reached its intended recipient carrier pigeons have been used for centuries and were used in both world wars to convey military messages			0
they can reach speeds of 80mph and distances of 700 miles			0
the @entity88 trained 250,000 birds in @entity90 , forming the @entity91			0
the were so relied upon that the government even introduced a special @entity88 squadron to cull falcons and hawks who attacked them			0
the birds would be dropped into @entity3 occupied @entity98 using mini parachutes			0
they were then picked up and secret messages were inserted into capsules on their legs			0
the birds would then fly hundreds of miles back home			1
when they landed , wires in the coop would sound a bell or buzzer and a soldier of the @entity111 would know a message had arrived			0
he would go to the coop , remove the message from the canister , and send it to its destination by telegraph , field phone , or personal messenger			0
thirty two pigeons were even decorated with the @entity123 during the war years - the animal equivalent of the @entity126			0
among them was @entity128 - a pigeon who carried out more than ninety missions during the war			2
another was @entity134 who was the first bird to deliver intelligence from an agent in enemy - occupied @entity138 in october 1940			2
@entity139 delivered an @entity141 message from a ditched aircrew 288 miles in 7.5 hours in 1942			0
mr @entity18 said : ‘ it will be amazing if we discover an unknown detail from such an important part of @entity5 history			1
’ some 250,000 pigeons were deployed in the @entity90			0
able to fly at a mile a minute , they carried messages from behind enemy lines and , like a forerunner of the ‘ black box ’ , accompanied @entity88 bomber crews in case they crashed			0
experts say the red capsule mr @entity18 found is the type used by the @entity159			1
their human agents undertook sabotage missions such as blowing up trains , bridges and factories in @entity166 - occupied territory			0
the message was written by a sergeant @entity168 and contains columns of groups of five letters			0
it is thought that its intended recipient , ‘ @entity174 ’ , is code for @entity176			2
one theory is that the message may have been requesting a bombing raid somewhere			0
another is that the pigeon was bound for @entity183 ’s hq in @entity184 , @entity8 , from where he planned the d - day landings			1
homing pigeons were taken on the d - day invasion and released by @entity189 to keep generals back on @entity192 shores updated on the operation			2
some pigeons were based at @entity44 , which is now a museum			1
but @entity201 , curator of its permanent ‘ @entity202 ’ exhibition , said all of the pigeon messages in its archives are in long - hand , not code			2
‘ the message mr @entity18 found must be highly top secret , ’ mr @entity201 said			1
‘ the aluminium ring found on the bird ’s leg tells us it was born in 1940 , and we know it ’s an @entity189 pigeon because of the red capsule it was carrying , but that ’s all we know			1
’ en route : experts believe the pigeon and coded message may have been flying back from @entity3 to @entity216 in @entity184 , @entity8			1
@entity183 is pictured in 1944			0

@entity18 , 74 , found the *stricken* bird when he opened the *disused* fire place while *renovating* his @entity8 home
it is thought the pigeon may have stopped on the chimney and become overcome with fumes
experts believe the pigeon may have been flying back to @entity216 in @entity184 , @entity8 or @entity44 , @entity45
