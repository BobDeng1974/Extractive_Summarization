one thing that will not change in the new version however , is the customary list of possible murder weapons - the candlestick , dagger , lead piping , revolver , rope and wrench			1
there are 324 potential murder combinations in the new game , with the victim - a high profile @entity100 - always staying the same			0
and it includes portraits of each character , with the mayor , who lives in @entity105 , described as ' loved by the people ' with ' an abundance of charisma '			0
but in @entity56 , suspicion is rife as rumours spread about the board ’s @entity100 turning on the mayor and exposing him so he will ditch his ambitious plans to climb politics ‘ greasy pole ’			0
and all the other shady characters are under suspicion too , with the @entity118 - based therapist ’s motive for murder stemming from a move she made on the @entity100 , who has been using her couch in an unorthodox way			2
@entity25 - based games maker winning moves @entity125 is launching the game today at @entity127 , @entity105 , with the help of a @entity129 look - alike on a @entity130 armed with a giant candlestick			2
suspect : the new version features the likes of footballer @entity134 who is described as ' consumed by greed ' familiar : the blond mayor is described as having ' an abundance of charisma ' the new game features new suspects new landmark murder scenes replace the old rooms the game still features the same selection of weapons @entity118 therapist @entity29 is one of the new characters journalist @entity58 is ' always looking for the next scoop ' @entity149 is a talent show winner ' clinging to stardom ' traditional : the original @entity15 game as released by @entity153 an oversized 5ft by 5ft replica of the game will also be on show , and people around the capital will be treated to @entity15 street art complete with a silhouette game and the words ‘ was it the mayor ’ outside tube stations and popular tourist destinations			1
‘ detectives ’ have been handing out @entity168 tips as to ‘ @entity169 ’ across @entity25 this morning , telling the public to meet at @entity105 at 1pm to solve the case			0
winning moves @entity125 chairman @entity174 said : ' the public has been asking us for some time to do regionalised @entity15			2
and with the 2012 buzz around @entity25 , we are now delighted to oblige			0
' we have very exciting plans to roll out other regional @entity15 ’s across the @entity125 and @entity179 too			2
' the board game @entity15 was first patented by @entity49 solicitor 's clerk @entity54 back in 1944 and was originally called ' murder ! ' and designed to provide entertainment in shelters during lengthy air raids			1
but the game was n't released until 1949 after it was picked up by @entity153 who renamed it @entity15 - a play on the word ' clue ' and ' ludo ' which is @entity193 for ' i play '			0
it was released at around the same time in the @entity196 and renamed @entity15			0
unlike the version that board game fans came to know and love , @entity54 's original concept featured 10 characters , including names such as mr @entity203 and mr @entity204 , one of whom would be designated as the murder victim by random drawing at the beginning of each game			1
it also featured a range of nine weapons , with murders committed using an axe , bomb , poison or even a fireplace poker			0
there has been three editions released in the @entity125 over the years , with the longest lasting 47 years following the game 's release			0
the latest edition was released back in 2002/2003			0
as well as providing hours of fun as a board game , @entity15 has also been the inspiration for a number of spin off products , the 1985 cult classic film clue starring @entity229 and @entity230 , a @entity232 musical , a play and various game shows .			1

traditional @entity15 characters killed off as the popular board game gets a 21st century makeover
the new version will feature a footballer , socialite , journalist and therapist among the suspects
@entity25 landmarks such as @entity76 and @entity77 will replace the customary murder scenes
but the classic murder weapons including the revolver , rope and candlestick stay put in the new version
manufacturers hope to roll out a range of regionalised versions of the game next year
