@entity2 ’s @entity1 spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet erupting from comet @entity5			1
the jet may have been caused by a wave of heat reaching ice trapped under the surface , causing an explosion of material			1
but it is unusual , because so far such activity has only been spotted on the day - side of the comet - not the night , like this			1
the first image was taken at 7:13am bst ( 2:13am est ) on 12 march , and the second was taken two minutes later			2
the jet is unusual because it is erupting from the dark underside of the comet , whereas such activity had only been seen on the day side so far			1
credit : @entity2 the two images , released yesterday , were taken by the @entity32 camera on the @entity1 spacecraft from a distance of 47 miles ( 75km ) , according to @entity2			1
as the comet gets closer to the sun , its surface gets warmer , causing frozen gases to erupt from the surface , carrying dust particles			0
but it ’s not clear if this caused the jet - or an explosion of material caused by ice sublimating ( turning from solid to gas ) underground			1
in the first image , taken at 7:13am bst ( 2:13am est ) on 12 march , the upper comet can be seen with several rays of dust illuminated by the sun , while the dark underside shows no such features			2
two minutes later though , in the second image , a spectacular new jet emerges from the dark side , hurling dust into space at 26ft ( eight metres ) per second			1
‘ this was a chance discovery , ’ said @entity32 principal investigator dr @entity61 from the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) in @entity63			1
‘ no one has ever witnessed the wake - up of a dust jet before			0
it is impossible to plan such an image			0
’ how or why the activity occurred in the dark region of the comet , though , is not yet understood			2
‘ it is possible that the first rays of sunlight hit some cliffs or outcrops that remained hidden to @entity1 due to the orbital position at the time , ’ said @entity32 scientist dr @entity74 , also from the @entity62			1
the @entity1 probe , which carried the @entity84 lander , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity87 and @entity88 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity90			1
it chased comet 67p through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity84 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet			0
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			0
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			0
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
@entity84 managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , is continuing to orbit and study the comet			1
from data collected by the two proves , @entity2 said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity87 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			0
in the first image ( left ) , the upper comet can be seen with several rays of dust illuminated by the sun , while the dark underside shows no such features			2
two minutes later , in the second image ( right ) , a spectacular new jet emerges from the dark side , hurling dust into space at 26ft ( eight metres ) per second the @entity1 probe , illustrated , which carried the @entity84 lander , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity87 and @entity88 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity142			1
it chased comet @entity90 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014 the region of the comet where this jet erupted from is known as @entity150			2
by 7:17am bst ( 2:17am est ) , the region had rotated into sunlight , and the jet was no longer visible against the overexposed coma			0
this means scientists are n’t sure if the eruption was short - lived , or was a continuous jet			2
‘ usually , @entity21 ’s dust - jets are rather long - lived , ’ said dr @entity74			2
‘ most of them last for a full dayside rotation of approximately six hours and even reappear in the next rotation			0
’ @entity1 is continuing to study comet 67p ahead of its closest approach to the sun in august			1
and engineers on @entity87 are also hopeful that the @entity84 lander on the surface will soon get enough solar power to wake up from its slumber			0
this recent image was taken on 15 april from a distance of 103 miles ( 165km )			0
it has been processed to spotlight the comet ’s activity , including a striking jet on the left , near the neck region this image was also taken on 15 april , from a distance of 106 miles ( 170km ) from the comet ’s centre			2
it shows the small lobe of the comet on the left , and its large lobe on the right @entity1 is continuing to study comet 67p ahead of its closest approach to the sun in august			1
and engineers on @entity87 are also hopeful that the @entity84 ( illustrated ) on the surface will soon get enough solar power to wake up from its slumber			0

scientists in @entity63 observed a jet erupting from comet @entity21
the event was captured by the @entity32 camera on the @entity1 spacecraft
in images two minutes apart , the jet appears on the dark side of the comet
it may have formed when melting ice caused an explosion of material
