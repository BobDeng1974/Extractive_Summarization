by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 16:07 est , 15 november 2012 stealing : @entity2 boss @entity1 has accused the @entity3 of copying @entity5 's programme format their stock in trade is the soothing and the genteel			1
however , @entity12 's two classical music radio stations are at the centre of an unseemly row over an ' aggressive ' bid by @entity16 to steal @entity5 's listeners			1
the popular commercial station claims that its @entity3 rival , which has overhauled its schedule over the last 18 months , has imitated a string of ideas : from listener phone - ins to request slots			2
@entity1 , the boss of the @entity2 , which includes @entity5 , yesterday said that the @entity3 had been ' overtly ' copying it by introducing changes			1
appearing at the @entity28 in @entity29 , mr @entity1 said : ' if you look at the changing programmes @entity16 has done against @entity5 , it is pretty overt that it has looked at the successes that @entity5 has had and adjusted its programming structure			1
' he added : ' it 's now possible to listen to @entity16 between 6:30am and 4:30pm and hear only one hour that 's not presented by a former @entity5 presenter			1
' @entity16 has introduced listener requests on the phone every day - copying the format pioneered by @entity5 in classical music radio in the @entity12			1
' if you look at what they 're doing , it 's what we 've been doing for years			0
' the @entity3 's whole remit is to provide distinct content in all they do , but it is increasingly replicating what is already catered for			1
and you can see why , because we have a much larger listenership			0
' @entity16 has aggressively pursued @entity5 and it uses its other platforms to cross-promote the station			1
they are absolutely trying to take our listeners			0
' @entity16 has changed its schedule in the past 18 months in an attempt to broaden its appeal , but some listeners have complained that it increasingly sounds like rival network @entity5			1
the station has introduced a morning programme called @entity64 , which has been compared to @entity5 's @entity65 that airs at the same time			1
and its breakfast show has been criticised for relying too much on the audience to call , text or tweet in their views and take part in competitions			0
mr @entity1 said that most of the changes had been inspired by @entity5			2
he said : ' @entity16 's breakfast show is now made up short excerpts of classical music - instead of the full works it broadcast previously			1
that means less choice for the listeners			0
' @entity5 launched a weekly classical cd sales chart when it launched in 1992			2
@entity16 has copied this , launching its own chart			2
copycats : the @entity3 has come under attack for replicating commercial shows on @entity16 with listeners claiming programming has been ' dumbed down ' @entity91 act : @entity92 has worked for @entity5 since 2006 ' @entity16 's cut back on jazz programmes during the day - replacing them with classical music programmes and moving jazz mainly to late nights - reducing listener choice to compete with @entity5 head - on			1
' @entity16 now has more film soundtracks in its daytime programmes - particularly breakfast - copying @entity5			1
' despite the changes , @entity16 's audience has only marginally increased			2
in figures released last month it had 2.15million listeners , up just over one per cent on the same time last year			0
at the same time @entity5 had 5.45million listeners			2
many @entity16 listeners have called for a return to ' pure and simple good music '			2
@entity112 , from @entity113 , labelled the changes a case of cultural vandalism			0
while listeners said the new programmes were more ' @entity119 ' because of their reliance on audience participation			2
one listener told @entity123 : ' i finally switched off breakfast this morning			0
a dj instead of a presenter , snippets of stuff from newspapers filling in the cracks , invitations to tweet , and bitty music , all of which i have heard a million times before			0
' others have accused the presenters of behaving like they had drunk too much caffeine			1
last year , governing body the @entity140 told @entity16 to ' extend its core appeal ' but said it must do so without ' jeopardising distinctiveness '			0
it said there were times when the station could sound ' heavy and inaccessible ' and was viewed as ' elitist ' , before recommending that it should be more welcoming			0
the station , which is predominantly listened to by those who are over 55 , and middle class , was effectively told to find ways of finding younger and more minority audiences			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' @entity3 national stations offer a distinctive range of programming with a strong public service focus which marks them out from commercial stations			0
' @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity16 all organise big events and focus on speech , drama , live music , new music and music that has limited airplay elsewhere			0
' we are always sensitive to leaving space for the commercial sector and we are delighted that companies such as @entity2 continue to thrive			0
