student @entity0 was shopping in her local @entity1 ’s when she decided to give her girlfriend a spontaneous peck on the cheek			1
one fellow customer , however , did n’t see the ‘ light kiss ’ as a romantic gesture – and reported the couple to a security guard who allegedly then told them to leave			1
the female guard explained that the shopper had complained that the lesbian clinch was ‘ disgusting ’ , and that she was ‘ worried for her child ’			2
infuriated , the 22 - year - old reported the incident to fellow gay rights activists online , declaring that @entity1 ’s was guilty of perpetrating a hate crime and that she had a ‘ human right ’ to kiss in the supermarket			2
the row began on saturday – which was @entity25 – in a @entity1 ’s in @entity26 , a town known for its vibrant gay scene			1
in a post on gay rights charity @entity32 ’s @entity31 page , miss @entity0 said : ‘ the security guard later apologised , saying that she herself was gay and had simply been asked to speak to us by another customer who found us “ disgusting ” and was “ worried for her child ”			1

’ last night a @entity1 ’s spokesman said that it had made a full apology , promised similar incidents would not happen again and said it had paid money to a charity of miss @entity0 ’s choice			1
the spokesman denied the security guard had told miss @entity0 to leave , and instead asked her to stop kissing , but apologised for her treatment all the same			1
‘ this should never have happened – it is clear that she and her partner were not behaving inappropriately and we are very sorry that they were treated in this way , ’ the spokesman said			0
‘ we have called her to apologise and will be making a donation to a charity of her choice			0
