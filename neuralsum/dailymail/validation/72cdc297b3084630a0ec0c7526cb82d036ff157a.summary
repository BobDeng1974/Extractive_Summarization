@entity1 boss @entity0 is under no illusions about the potential repercussions of monday night ’s visit to @entity5			1
any clash against @entity7 , particularly in the @entity0 era , carries added value for the @entity10			1
the fact that it is an @entity12 quarter - final with a place at @entity14 at stake merely adds to the occasion			1
and for @entity0 it ’s a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on @entity21 ’s side ahead of the tense season finale			2
@entity23 holds off @entity24 as @entity1 trained on sunday at their @entity26 training ground @entity27 lets fly with a shot , as @entity0 promised his team would attack @entity7 the @entity10 squad are put through their paces as they look to reach @entity14 for the third time in two years @entity0 is confident his team can beat @entity7 by playing attacking football the @entity12 is n’t the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe			1
they are also battling for a @entity39 position , a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs ’ long - term ambitions			2
there are no points at stake tonight but @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s a big game , and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team			2
’ however , the reverse is also true			0
losing against @entity7 could plant a seed of doubt in @entity1 ’s quest to finish in the top four — and their poor recent record at @entity5 does n’t bode well			1
@entity7 have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the @entity10			1
we should n’t forget , though , that @entity0 also has pleasant memories of the @entity5			1
he lists @entity63 ’s goal that clinched the title for @entity1 at @entity5 in 2002 as his favourite			1
and the @entity66 insists his current crop of players can produce another win in @entity7 ’s back yard on monday night			1
@entity1 's @entity72 winning playmaker @entity71 has been in top form since returning from injury @entity76 forward @entity75 , who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against @entity78 , looks lively in training per @entity82 , whose place was in doubt before an injury to @entity85 , gestures to his team - mates ‘ i do n’t believe our recent record at @entity5 ( to be a factor )			1
when the team is less good , they lose			0
when the team is not as good , they lose , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it does n’t matter what shirt they wear , or what stadium they play in			0
it is down to quality			0
‘ if i ’ve learnt something in my life it ’s that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day , not where you play			0
‘ the fact that we can win away from home , that is important			0
if you have n’t won away from home all season it ’s more difficult			2
but we know we can do well away from home			0
’ @entity114 attempts to control the ball as @entity23 , @entity82 and @entity116 watch on indeed , their victory over @entity119 at the @entity120 earlier this season proved they can produce big away performances against @entity125 ’s elite , and @entity0 insists last season ’s @entity12 triumph has bolstered belief that his side can become @entity125 football ’s top dogs once more			1
‘ yes , of course we want to dominate again , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i think today you have more competitors and it will get worse with the seasons coming because you get more money in			0
that means even the smaller teams will be capable to buy the best players in @entity141			0
@entity63 ’s goal at @entity5 in 2002 that clinched the league title for the @entity10 at @entity5 ‘ maybe the competition will become harder for everybody			1
winning the @entity12 gave us energy because we had a few years without winning a trophy and so on that front it was vital			0
‘ this team has a good mentality because we had a slow start this season and every time we lost a big game you see how much the players are touched			0
‘ i think the mentality is very healthy , they want to do well and we will be focused on @entity7			0
‘ once you get to the quarter - final you think that ’s a good opportunity to win a trophy			0
you want to do it , but it ’s at that stage where it ’s conflicting always with the @entity39			2
