by @entity0 and @entity1 it is a classic whodunnit stretching back more than 40 years to a chance find in a @entity5 bookstore , where @entity6 and @entity7 first discovered the sketchbook			1
yet the identity of the artist who sketched the scenes between the 1920s and 1940s remains a mystery to this day			1
some of the sketches were apparently made as far afield as @entity15 , but a large number are of scenes from @entity18 – and the @entity19 have now appealed for information to help solve the puzzle			1
@entity23 sketch : @entity24 in 1941 , with the @entity25 in the background escape from the war : a scene of tranquility on the @entity31 in 1941 , near where it meets the @entity34 such is their determination to trace the artist that they have published a book of the sketches which feature scenes from the @entity44 and @entity45 areas as well as the @entity46 , pictured in 1941			1
@entity47 – on the @entity48 tells the story of the set of sketches which the @entity52 discovered in a slim blue leather - bound volume when they were browsing in a bookstore in the @entity56 , @entity57 , in 1971			2
they begin on an ocean liner in the 1920s and conclude in @entity5 in the 1940s			1
one clue is the initials @entity63 on the front cover of the sketchbook , but written in an ‘ inelegant ’ hand which suggests that it may not be that of the artist			2
@entity69 voyage : a shipboard scene sketched on the @entity71 bound for @entity15 in 1925 @entity72 in 1925 : some of the sketches were apparently made as far afield as @entity15 the early sketches , all dated but unsigned , were done on board the ocean liner @entity77 as she was steaming to @entity79 in @entity15 at the end of 1925			1
' on and off over the years we have chased down all sorts of clues , but few have yielded worthwhile nuggets for us ' @entity86 next come sketches ‘ up country ’ in @entity88 , now @entity89 , and then there ’s a pause before the artist resumes sketching in the @entity94 between 1940 and 1942			2
in june 1941 , the artist sketched scenes of @entity24 and the @entity25			1
a month or so later , sketches were made of the @entity97 near @entity44 , and the next week was at @entity45 and the @entity98			0
the @entity99 have noticed that most of the @entity94 sketches were close to @entity102 establishments , and they believe the artist – or his or her spouse – was probably in the @entity102 at the time and moving around , possibly to help with training			0
trying to solve the mystery : it is a classic whodunnit stretching back more than 40 years to a chance find in a @entity5 bookstore , where @entity6 and @entity7 ( pictured ) first discovered the sketchbook @entity114 adventure : the @entity115 in 1920s @entity88 the book even contains a list of all the passengers for the voyage on the @entity71 , in a bid to identify anyone on board who might be able to help join the dots			1
mr @entity86 , 77 , who lives with his wife in @entity126 , @entity127 , said : ‘ we ’re especially interested to know if anyone has any pictures or memorabilia relating to the @entity102 around @entity44 , @entity24 or @entity45 in the summer of 1941 , so we can try and cross-check any names with the passenger lists			0
‘ for the most part the sketches are dated , so we can pinpoint precisely where the artist was at various times in those years			2
but who was the artist ? ‘ the sketches are charming , most likely the work of a gifted amateur rather than a trained professional			0
watching : approaching the island of @entity145			0
the early sketches , all dated but unsigned , were done on board the ocean liner @entity77 as she was steaming to @entity79 in @entity15 at the end of 1925 drawing : @entity151 nets on @entity97 in 1941			1
the @entity99 have noticed that most of the @entity94 sketches were close to @entity102 establishments ‘ the artist was maybe using the sketchbook as a camera when travelling or on holiday , capturing special scenes for her or his memory			2
‘ on and off over the years we have chased down all sorts of clues , but few have yielded worthwhile nuggets for us , except the passenger list – hidden among the 225 or so souls listed on the manifest is the name of the man or woman who did the sketches			0
‘ it is , of course , unreasonable to think that the artist is still alive today – he or she would be aged well over 100			0
on the other hand , it is highly likely that children or grandchildren are still with us			0
‘ so our success in identifying the mystery artist lies in one of those descendants hearing this story , directly or indirectly , and recognising a forebear who “ ticks the boxes ”			0
