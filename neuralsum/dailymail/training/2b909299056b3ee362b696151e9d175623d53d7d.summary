by @entity1 reporter losing interest in hobbies and other activities in old age could be an early sign of dementia , say scientists			1
a @entity10 study found that elderly people who were apathetic but not suffering depression had shrinking amounts of grey and white matter – neurons in the brain that control memory and communication respectively			1
researchers say the findings offer doctors a new tool with which to identify a group of the population at risk of developing alzheimer ’s disease			2
the study has shown that patients suffering from @entity30 lose interest in their hobbies which can be an early indicator of the condition ( stock photo ) researchers gave mri scans to 4,354 people with an average age of 74 as part of the study people with two or more symptoms of @entity30 had on average 1.4 percent grey matter in their brain compared with healthy people dr @entity44 , of the @entity45 in @entity46 , said : ‘ just as signs of memory loss may signal brain changes related to brain disease , apathy may indicate underlying changes			1
‘ apathy symptoms are common in older people without dementia			2
and the fact participants in our study had apathy without depression should turn our attention to how apathy alone could indicate brain disease			0
’ the researchers used brain volume as a measure of accelerated brain ageing			0
neuron losses occur during normal ageing but larger ones could indicate brain diseases			0
in the study , 4,354 people without dementia and with an average age of 76 underwent an mri scan			1
they were also asked questions that measure apathy symptoms which include lack of interest , lack of emotion , dropping activities and interests and preferring to stay at home , and having a lack of energy			2
researchers found that apathy was a common complaint among patients with @entity30 people with two or more symptoms had 1.4 per cent less grey matter and 1.6 per cent less white matter compared to those who had fewer			1
grey matter is where learning takes place and memories are stored in the brain			1
white matter acts as the communication cables that connect different parts of the brain			0
dr @entity44 said : ‘ if these findings are confirmed , identifying people with apathy earlier may be one way to target an at - risk group			0
’ the study is published online in @entity109 – the medical journal of the @entity111 .			0

new study shows that patients with @entity30 *'s* have less grey matter than healthy people
@entity10 researchers performed almost 4,400 mri scans on elderly patients
losing interest in favoured hobbies can be an early sign of dementia
