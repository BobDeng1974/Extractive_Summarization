@entity4 , 29 , said she turned to prostitution when she was a penniless student			2
the ‘ self - employed escort ’ went on to study for a master ’s degree but was able to buy a flat in @entity14 ’s @entity13 , putting down a £ 110,000 deposit in cash			1
she was caught when police found huge amounts of cash in her possession and realised she had not paid income tax of £ 120,000 on it			1
investigators believe @entity4 was earning around £ 3,000 a week on average , and charging up to £ 1,000 a night			2
yesterday she tottered into @entity25 on her high heels , wearing a tight black miniskirt and jacket and a striped blouse with her dark hair dyed blonde			0
she wept as the court was told that her parents , council worker @entity33 , 52 , and @entity34 , 51 , learned of her secret double life as a prostitute after the police began their case against her			0
prosecutor @entity39 had told the court that concrete facts and figures were hard to come by , ‘ given the nature of the employment she was engaged in ’			0

another prosecutor , @entity59 , told the court : ‘ this defendant was working for years as an escort and in that job she received significant sums of money			2
‘ when she was arrested she read out a pre-prepared statement in which she said she had been a self - employed escort for about ten years , and that she was often paid in cash and received valuable jewellery in gifts			1
’ prosecutors initially claimed that @entity4 made £ 870,000 over five years and owed £ 315,000 in tax			1
but yesterday she successfully argued that her period of tax free earnings lasted just two years			0
trial : @entity25 a police raid on @entity78 ' home found £ 73,000 stashed in her flat and items of high value jewellery given to her by some of her clients she was not charged with offences directly relating to the sex industry , because it is possible for a prostitute to operate within the law providing she works alone and in private premises			1
@entity4 worked out of her luxury flat			0
but her financial affairs were a different matter , and she faced three charges relating to fraud and theft			0
she had denied one charge of money laundering £ 110,000 for alleged criminals @entity98 and @entity99 , and another of using deception to obtain her £ 250,000 mortgage from the @entity103 building society – she had pretended to a be a racehorse consultant			1
those charges were left to lie on the file , but she admitted defrauding the taxman between april 2005 and january 2007 , when she made more than £ 300,000 as an escort			1
@entity109 , defending , told the court that @entity4 started work as an escort to fund her university education			1
‘ it is lamentable that any young woman should have to come to @entity14 and do this kind of work in order to support herself , ’ he said			2
‘ her family have been embarrassed by these proceedings , not only because of the offence but because they did n’t know she was working as an escort in the first place			2
the criminal offence was committed in naivety on her part , as she was only 22 when this started			0
funding : asutaits started working as a call - girl to pay for a masters degree at the @entity133 ‘ since this has been hanging over her , she has suffered from depression and insomnia and has taken illicit drugs , and has dropped out of her master ’s degree			1
’ jailing @entity4 for 16 months , judge @entity140 said she had deliberately avoided paying tax			0
‘ the amount of tax which is subject to this charge which has been evaded is £ 120,000 , ’ he said			2
‘ in my judgment this was an offence that was fraudulent from the outset carried out over a significant period of time			0
’ in november the court will rule on how much @entity4 must repay to the taxman – but the sum is likely to be covered by the £ 130,000 already seized from her			0
last night her uncle , @entity154 , said at his home in @entity156 that his niece had been a pupil at the @entity159 catholic school			0
