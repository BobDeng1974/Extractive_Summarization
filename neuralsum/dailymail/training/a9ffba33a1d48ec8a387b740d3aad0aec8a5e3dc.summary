physically unimposing but allergic to giving the ball away , @entity0 will go down as @entity3 's greatest ever player , the man who best represented a generation that won three major international trophies back - to - back , and rivaled the @entity7 1970 side for the accolade of ‘ best ever ’			1
he was in @entity9 in 2008 when @entity3 ended its 44 - year wait for a trophy winning the @entity12 , he was in @entity13 two years later as they became @entity15 , and in @entity17 in 2012 as they completed the hat - trick			1
he was also in @entity19 in 1999 alongside @entity20 as the seeds of senior success were sown with an under - 20 @entity24 triumph			2
@entity3 ’s golden era started with his emergence and in @entity7 it appeared to have ended with his demise			1
but those losses will be forgotten long before the victories in @entity57 , @entity47 and @entity43			0
@entity3 were terminal big - tournament failures in 2008 – a different hard luck story every two years – and @entity61 was an unpopular coach going into the tournament having ousted @entity64 legend @entity63 and handed leadership responsibilities to @entity66 midfielder @entity0			1
the pay - back came throughout the tournament but none more so than in the final when his clever lofted pass over the @entity75 defence on the half hour put @entity76 through to beat @entity77 for the only goal of the game			2
at 28 - years of age that might have been the peak for @entity0 but he was only just getting started			1
two years later he swaggered through the @entity24 picking holes in the rival defences that now tended to line up eight - men deep against the @entity85			2
he got his hands on the @entity24 after @entity87 scored the winner against the @entity89 and would stand alongside him a few month later on the @entity91 podium			0
many @entity3 fans still see it as an injustice that he finished third and not first in the voting			1
in the @entity97 two years later there were signs that the old midfield metronome was staring to lose time but he kept his place all the way to the final and produced one of his best ever performances in @entity3 ’s perfect 4 - 0 victory over @entity108			1
all smiles : @entity0 ( far right ) celebrates winning @entity41 with team - mates ( from left to right ) @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity20 benched : @entity0 watches from the sidelines as @entity3 beat @entity49 in their final @entity24 group game younger days : @entity0 tussles with an opposition player during a @entity24 clash with @entity47 in 2002 praise : @entity122 columnist @entity121 ( right ) has described @entity0 as the best midfielder he has ever seen it ’s not just his football that will be missed from the international stage – a willingness to talk about the beautiful game has always made him stand out from his contemporaries			1
he was interviewed by @entity122 in 2011 and engaged for over an hour on the differences between the @entity131 and the @entity85 game displaying all the intelligence off the pitch that he has shown for , first @entity61 and then @entity136 , on it			0
for such an important player he also managed to remain understated in the most dramatic of circumstances			0
in the @entity24 semi-final against @entity142 in 2010 with just two minutes left the match referee asked him if he could have his shirt after the game			0
' if you blow the whistle a minute early it ’s yours , ' was his reply			0
there were times when his willingness to talk football upset some who found @entity3 ’s domination tiresome			1
he was fond of talking about his team ’s ‘ superiority ’ on the pitch though more often that not that meant numerical superiority , with so much of their success due to always having the extra man in all areas of the pitch			0
battle : @entity0 shone as @entity3 comfortably defeated @entity108 to be crowned @entity167 champions in 2012 back of the net : @entity0 pounces to score against @entity169 in the @entity171 semi-finals against @entity169 and @entity0 was so often that extra man , appearing for a team - mate receiving and then moving the ball on			1
‘ i get the ball , i give the ball , i get the ball , i give the ball ’ as his club coach at @entity66 , @entity178 , once put it			2
at the @entity180 he played 599 accurate passes with a 91 per cent success rate			2
it will be a long time before that kind of relentless domination of possession is seen again			0
and before anyone plays such a big part in three straight tournament victories			0
@entity190 ' to quit ' @entity191			0

@entity0 has *announced* his retirement from international duty
the *34* - year - old helped his country win @entity97 2008 , the @entity180 and @entity41
he *struggled* for playing time as @entity3 crashed out of the @entity33 in the group stage
the @entity66 midfielder made his debut in 2000 and won 133 caps
@entity0 is now *widely* regarded as @entity3 's best ever player
