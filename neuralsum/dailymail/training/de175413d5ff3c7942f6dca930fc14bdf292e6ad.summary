when you are the first beaver to be spotted in the wild in @entity3 for 800 years , it must get a little lonely			1
so thankfully , the male pictured at the aptly named @entity5 last month has now found some companions to swim with			2
amazing images of the family of wild beavers have been captured by the same retired environmental scientist who pictured the solitary male			1
a total of three beavers , two are pictured , have been caught grooming themselves , gnawing the base of trees and playing together in the same location the three @entity24 beavers are thought to be adults and were filmed paddling together and gnawing at trees on the riverbank			1
their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries			2
eager beavers : could the @entity35 be replaced by furrier workers ? @entity37 set up three infra - red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river in east @entity15 after he first noticed trees had been nibbled there last october			1
he said he believed the male had been lost from a breeding farm but nobody claimed him			0
there are several such programmes in the @entity50 , including the nearby @entity51 , but none of the animals are unaccounted for			2
‘ when we saw three , that ’s a totally different situation altogether , ’ said mr @entity37			2
‘ three indicates a family and looking at the footage , all three are quite sizeable and active , which indicates to me that they are not young			2
i would expect them to be at least two years old			0
‘ that indicates they may have been around for at least two years or more			0
‘ during that time , they may have been fitting in very nicely in terms of the environment			0
’ mr @entity37 said he could n’t believe his eyes when he came across the images of the first beaver at the river last month			1
‘ for me , there was a combination of amazement and a little bit of disbelief , ’ he said			0
‘ i had looked through hundreds of video clips and there was nothing at all in them			0
‘ then there was one beaver , i was a little bit taken aback			2
’ the trio has also been seen interacting with local wild otters and felling trees in the area			1
the beaver is shown in the bottom left of this image , while the top of the otter is the shown swimming past him the animals were pictured in a sequence of shots taken beside the @entity5 , in @entity51 , near @entity95 , @entity15 , pictured beavers were hunted to extinction in @entity3 and @entity98 during the 12th century and disappeared from the rest of the @entity50 400 years later			1
landowner @entity100 admitted he has no idea where the creatures , a single beaver is pictured , have come from beavers were once common throughout @entity50 but were hunted to extinction in @entity3 and @entity98 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur , meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal ’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure			1
they remained in @entity113 but disappeared from the @entity50 completely 400 years ago			0
natural powers : facts about beavers the family ’s arrival in @entity15 this month remains a mystery but @entity100 , who owns the land , said he is delighted with his new neighbours			1
‘ we are quite happy for them to be here , ’ he said			0
‘ at some point we will possibly have to go in and clear up some of the wood because it could possibly cause a flood problem			0
‘ but it ’s all very interesting – my wife has just started a holiday business with a safari tent and this will give people something extra to look at			0
’ the @entity136 is investigating the sighting			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it is unlawful to release beavers in @entity3 – we are looking into this case and will consider what action to take			1
’ @entity143 , of the @entity144 , said : ‘ this is not necessarily the right way to go about having beavers reintroduced to the @entity3 countryside			1
it would be better if it was done in a planned way			0
‘ but now they are here we need to take a really close look on the impact they have			0
‘ i think we should leave them alone but observe their impact on the local landscape			2
’ there are two species of beaver , the @entity24 and @entity163			2
the @entity24 is considered ‘ vulnerable ’			0
it is extinct in most of @entity165 , with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from @entity169 to the @entity171 and @entity172 borders			0
there were several attempts to breed @entity163 and @entity24 beavers to boost numbers of the @entity24 species , until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible			0
sightings of a single beaver , pictured , were reported in july 2013 , and again in january this year , in the same location where the family has been seen			1
these images , as well as the new shots of the beaver family , were all captured by retired scientist @entity37 during recent years beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at @entity51 and @entity190 - but none are unaccounted for			1
here , a beaver gnaws on wood in captivity @entity37 used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island near the river , after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees			1
this image is one of the results the retired scientist first noticed a tree that had been damaged from nibbling , which made him want to get photographic evidence of the beaver 's @entity212 photo documents the damage done by the wild beaver			1

a trio of beavers has been spotted on @entity5 , in @entity51 , @entity15
retired scientist @entity37 has been filming the area for several months
he caught the family grooming themselves and gnawing the base of trees
they were also seen interacting with local wild otters
sightings of a single beaver were reported in july 2012 and in january
beavers were once native to @entity3 but were hunted to extinction during the reign of @entity236 in the 16th century
