so , what ’s the deal with double points ? seems a bit bonkers to me			1
you would n’t be the only who thinks it ’s a loopy idea			0
the contentious new ruling will be used for the first time in the sport ’s history this weekend , and it ’s been branded a farce by the drivers and fans alike			0
the idea behind it is to keep the championship alive heading into the season finale			2
however , it could scupper @entity22 ’s bid to win a second title			2
under normal circumstances he would only need to finish sixth in @entity25 to guarantee the title , but with double points , he must now finish second			1
@entity22 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) could both win the @entity29 championship in @entity25 surely that is n’t fair , though ? probably not , and the fans will probably be in uproar if @entity27 triumphs by virtue of the ruling			1
it does n’t make any sense for one race to be worth more than another , particularly the soulless surroundings of @entity25			0
it would have been a better idea to award double points at one of the blue - riband events ; @entity45 or @entity46 for instance			2
the @entity48 in @entity25 hosts the final race of 2014 @entity29 season , with double points up for grabs 1			1
@entity22 - 334 points 2			2
@entity27 - 317 points @entity22 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity56 on sunday week , even if @entity27 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity22 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
whose idea was it ? you may be unsurprised to hear it was @entity70 ’s brainchild , the same man who thought the introduction of sprinklers during a race would be a good idea , too			0
the 84 - year - old originally wanted the final three races to carry double points , but failed to get the green light			1
he ’s now distanced himself from it in recent weeks			0
indeed , in the build - up to the season finale , he said : ‘ one race is stupid but imagine if it was the last three races			1
it means that somebody would have to have a 150 - point advantage minimum to be sure they will win			0
the teams have not accepted it because they are bloody idiots			0
’ @entity29 chief executive @entity70 poses with @entity46 footballer @entity92 at the @entity46 @entity56 does that mean double points will be off the menu in 2015 then ? it seems that way			1
the teams and drivers appear unanimous in their disdain for the ruling , and it sounds as though @entity70 has had enough , too			0
‘ i do n’t know what we are going to do next year , ’ he claimed			0
that said , as it stands , the ruling still forms part of next year ’s @entity106 , so action will need to be taken over the winter to ensure they do n’t return			0
‘ nobody likes the double points , ’ @entity111 boss @entity110 said			1
‘ we are going to discuss that next time around , i do n’t think @entity70 likes them , so it ’s probably something we should be getting rid of for next year			0
’ @entity27 hurls his trophy into the air as @entity22 is awarded his trophy for second place at the @entity46 gp what happens if @entity27 wins the title then ? will he be viewed as a deserving champion ? many would see it as a case of @entity22 being robbed rather than @entity27 winning fair and square			2
indeed , even if @entity27 wins on sunday it will be his sixth of the season compared to the ten racked up by @entity22			2
however , we should not forget that @entity27 has beaten his team - mate in qualifying this season with the @entity133 widely considered as one of the quickest drivers over one lap in the sport , nor that @entity22 would have lost the title to @entity139 in 2008 had the double points ruling been in place then			1
you can only play to the rules in front of you			0
@entity111 team - mates @entity22 and @entity27 have been battling each other in a two - horse race all season			1

the @entity29 season comes to an end in @entity25 on sunday
double points are available for the first time in the season finale
@entity111 ' @entity22 and @entity27 go head - to - head for the title
@entity22 leads his team - mate by 17 points going into final race
the @entity164 will win the championship if he secures a second - place finish
