by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:59 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:11 est , 17 december 2013 cap : drivers are paying £ 200m a year too much for insurance because of accident bills , an investigation has shown car accident costs , such as carrying out repairs and providing a replacement vehicle , could be capped to crack down on rip - offs			1
the @entity11 said yesterday that drivers are being overcharged some £ 200 million a year on motor insurance because accident costs are out of control			1
it is also concerned that repairs carried out following accidents may be shoddy and even dangerous			1
concerns were revealed in the provisional findings of a @entity11 investigation , which concluded the motor insurance market ‘ is not working well for motorists ’			1
the inquiry also raised questions about the cosy relationship between insurers and price comparison website , who take commission to recommend deals			0
the websites often make insurers sign contracts that promise not to offer cheaper premiums via rival websites with the result there is no meaningful competition			0
the main problems and exaggerated costs surround drivers whose cars are damaged by other road users through no fault of their own			2
generally , their own insurer will supply an expensive replacement vehicle and arrange for repairs , which can take a long time and are often expensive			2
these costs are then passed on to the insurer of the driver who was at fault and end up putting up insurance premiums for everyone on the road			0
commission chiefs have outlined a series of measures which it may implement to make the cost of dealing with accidents cheaper and so bring down the cost of motor premiums			1
these include making a driver ’s own insurer responsible for providing a replacement vehicle , plus caps on the costs of providing a temporary replacement and repairs			0
it is also looking at whether it is necessary to carry out compulsory audits on the quality of repairs offered by garages			0
the @entity11 said measures may be necessary to ensure there is genuine competition to offer the cheapest premium on price comparison websites			1
deputy chairman of the @entity11 , @entity83 , who is leading the motor insurance investigation , said : ‘ our provisional view is that many drivers of the @entity88 ’s 25 million privately registered cars are footing the bill for unnecessary costs incurred during the claims process following an accident			1
these costs are initially borne by the insurers of at - fault drivers , but they feed through into increased car insurance premiums for all drivers			1
relations : the inquiry also raised questions about the relationship between car insurers and price comparison websites ( library image ) ‘ there is insufficient incentive for insurers to keep costs down even though they are themselves on the receiving end of the problem			0
’ he added : ‘ we have concerns about the quality of post-accident repairs because too many repairs are substandard			1
‘ price comparison websites lead to increased competition to the benefit of motorists , but clauses requiring the same price to be offered for an insurer ’s product across the market reduce competition			1
’ the investigation has not considered the impact of personal injury claims on premiums , which has been a scandal in its own right			0
@entity132 became the whiplash capital of @entity134 in the last decade with lawyers and claims firms generating huge bills , often for bogus claims			0
the government has made efforts to tackle this abuse by banning ambulance - chased lawyers from paying referral fees to people and organisations who provide details of accident victims			0
the ban came into effect in april , however it is unclear if it is working			0
the @entity152 welcomed the @entity11 ’s efforts to cut down on costs , but it said some of the findings were based on flawed research			1
head of motor at the @entity152 , @entity159 , said ‘ today ’s possible remedies are a further step along the road to getting a market that enables insurers to deliver fully for consumers			2
’ he said that ‘ excessive costs ’ in dealing with accidents had been passed on to drivers for too long			2
‘ we welcome the provisional remedies which could give the at - fault insurer greater control over the claim they are paying for and reduce the overall cost of providing replacement vehicles to customers , ’ he said			0
mr @entity159 also welcomed efforts to stop price comparison websites from limiting competition on premiums			0
however , he said the commission ’s concerns about shoddy vehicle repairs and the need for quality audits were based on a flawed inspection report which looked a very small number of cases .			2
