a neglectful mother has been spared jail after a judge compared her child - rearing abilities to those of @entity14			2
@entity2 , 27 , appeared in the dock after regularly leaving her seven - month - old daughter home alone			2
she wept in court as she admitted child neglect , which carries a maximum sentence of ten years			1
however , judge @entity20 gave her a community order instead			1
in doing so , he referred to the recent revelation that mr @entity14 and his wife drove off without their eight - year - old daughter @entity7 after a sunday pub lunch			1
@entity2 , who routinely left her youngest alone for an hour every day while she took her two older children to and from school , admitted a charge of neglect but claimed she did not know she had done anything illegal			1
judge @entity20 sympathised , telling her : ‘ a parent makes mistakes in relation to children			1
‘ i include myself in that statement			0
recently , by way of an example , the prime minister left his own daughter in a pub. ’ @entity2 ’s school run took 40 minutes in the morning , and 20 in the afternoon			1
her neighbours tipped off police after seeing her leave home every day without her baby			0
when @entity2 was arrested , she pleaded with the officers : ‘ if i do n’t do it again , can i go ? ’ she also told police she could not manage to get the baby ’s buggy down the steps outside her house in @entity56			1
in addition , she claimed she received no childcare help from her family because they had shunned her after she refused an arranged marriage			0
abandoned : the child was left here for 40 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon because she could n't get the buggy up and down the steps judge @entity20 gave @entity2 a community order with 12 months ’ supervision , saying her only motive was to take her children to school			1
‘ what this case is not , like so many in court , is that you left children for only self - interest , ’ he said			0
‘ in that situation , i would be sentencing you to a term of imprisonment			0
‘ but this is not a case of you being an uncaring mother – quite the contrary			0
’ @entity2 said after the case that she had not realised leaving her baby alone was illegal			2
‘ when i took my two children to school my heart was pounding			0
‘ but i thought i was keeping her safe , ’ she explained			0
‘ no mother wants their child harmed but i did n’t realise it was the law not to leave them			0
i will never ever do that again			0
‘ i want to thank the judge for understanding my feelings and what i am going through			0
’ whoops : @entity14 , pictured holding his daughter @entity7 at a wedding in 2007 , thought @entity103 had all their children but she thought @entity7 was with him error : the @entity108 pub , where the @entity109 accidentally left their daughter @entity7 when they drove off in separate cars , which the judge compared to @entity114 acts of neglect the details of the @entity109 ’ accident emerged last month , weeks after the prime minister was widely ridiculed after a biography claimed he liked to ‘ chillax ’ at @entity121 on weekends			1
after the sunday lunch in question , the prime minister was driven back to @entity121 with his police protection officers in one car while his wife @entity128 drove children @entity130 , six , and @entity131 , one , home			2
@entity7 had popped in to the toilet without telling her parents as they left and each of her parents thought she was in the other car			2
a spokesman for mr @entity14 said he was ‘ distraught ’ when he realised what had happened , and confirmed that mrs @entity103 had returned to pick up @entity7 as soon as they discovered she was missing			1
she was found safe and well at the @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142 , and taken home .			0

@entity2 , 27 , left her daughter while she took her older children on the school run and did n't realise it was illegal
' if i do n't do it again will you let me go ? ' she told police when she was arrested for child neglect
her sentence could have been up to 10 years in prison but judge @entity20 said even the @entity123 forgot his child once
mr @entity14 left his *eldest* @entity7 at @entity108 near @entity121 by mistake three months ago
