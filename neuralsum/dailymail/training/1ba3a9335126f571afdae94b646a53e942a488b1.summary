@entity1 ’s defensive disasters have prompted @entity2 to consider using @entity3 as an emergency centre back			1
@entity5 midfielder @entity3 is still waiting to make his first appearance for the new @entity1 manager as he recovers slowly from an ankle injury he suffered in the summer			1
but the 33 - year - old is now doing some training at @entity11 and has already had a conversation with @entity13 about possibly playing in the centre of defence			1
the @entity17 coach is trying to steady the ship at the start of what is proving to be a traumatic @entity22 season			0
@entity3 ( centre with @entity24 and @entity25 ) could play centre - half for @entity1 @entity27 ( left ) and @entity24 were among those to struggle in the embarrassment at @entity30 on sunday @entity1 manager @entity2 ( centre ) has plenty to ponder in the coming weeks @entity3 has filled in at the heart of defence before @entity1 conceded a staggering five goals as they lost at @entity30 on sunday , having previously conceded four at @entity36 in the @entity37 and lost at home to @entity39 on the opening day of the campaign			1
@entity13 has lost @entity42 and @entity43 to injury while young central defender @entity27 was sent off on sunday at @entity30			1
@entity43 , who has a history of ankle trouble and needed surgery two years ago , is still on crutches after limping off in the first half at the @entity49			0
the @entity51 defender had a scan on monday and the initial assessment among @entity1 ’s medical staff is that he will be sidelined for four weeks			2
@entity3 has played in the centre of the defence before during the sir @entity58 era and has the experience and intelligence to operate in that role			1
the fact that the former @entity64 midfielder is being considered so early in the campaign would , however , appear to provide further evidence that @entity1 erred in the summer by not buying a top - class central defender			1
@entity3 has told friends this week that he would rather play in the central - midfield position he enjoys but he recognises that there is increased competition in that area and is ready to fill in further back without complaint			1
meanwhile , @entity74 , who was on the coaching staff at @entity76 last season , says @entity1 may need to spend another £ 100million on players before they can compete for the @entity22 title			2
‘ i know @entity1 have spent £ 150m , ’ @entity74 , 37 , told @entity80			2
‘ i think there ’s another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed — maybe £ 100m in all — before they can even think about winning the title			0
‘ there are still key positions in the team that need filling			0
i think the centre - back position is obviously the key area			0
holding midfield or central midfield needs addressing , ‘ they needed world - class players and there were no world - class centre backs out there			0
in the next two transfer windows , @entity1 might still be looking for that world - class defender			2
‘ i am certain @entity24 will come good and i have full faith in @entity42 as well			0
they ’ve bought a lot of foreign players , you do n’t get rid of your @entity105 spine			0
