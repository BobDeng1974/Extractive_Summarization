the early bird really does catch the worm … but he saves it for dinner			0
blue tits , great tits and other small garden birds scout for food in the morning but only return to eat it in the late afternoon , a study found			1
the @entity11 researchers believe the strategy allows them to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators			1
a full belly in the morning would slow them down in the hunt for food and make them easy prey			0
early riser : a foraging @entity18 with a worm in its beak so they search out food when lean and lithe and then dine in the evening to ensure they have a big enough store of fat to survive through the night			0
the ‘ early bird ’ strategy was revealed in an experiment in which over 2,000 birds were fitted with tiny radio tags which activated when they landed on feeders hidden in @entity32 , near @entity11			1
the feeders were moved around over the course of the day and the researchers noted when the birds landed on them			2
this revealed that the birds were much better at finding the feeders ’ new locations in the morning			0
however , they waited until the afternoon to get tucked in			0
the researchers said the complex strategy acts as an insurance policy , with birds remaining light yet still able to get enough fat to survive the night			1
it is particularly important in winter when the risks of predation are high and just one day without food can make the difference between life and death for small birds			1
the @entity11 researchers believe the strategy allows the birds to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators zoologist @entity58 said : ‘ birds have to store body fat to avoid starving during the cold winter nights , but this can make them slower and less manoeuvrable so they are more likely to be caught by predators			1
‘ so there is a trade - off , where birds need to remain lean enough in order to “ outrun ” their predators , or at least the next slowest bird , during the day but also store enough fat to survive each night			2
’ writing in the @entity72 journal @entity73 , he added that the study shows that rather than ‘ idly waiting ’ to until the afternoon , the birds start searching out food in the morning			2
‘ our results show these birds display very different patterns of food discovery in the morning and afternoon ; very few new food sources were found during the afternoon , whereas nearly every new food source we put out during the morning was quickly discovered			0
‘ it supports the idea of an ‘ early bird ’ strategy of scouting for food early on so they can return to feast a couple of hours before dusk in preparation for a long winter ’s night			0
