the boy was given free rein by his parents to watch graphic material on hi - tech gadgets such as his @entity18 console and @entity19			1
but in an unusual move , @entity20 directly linked the teenager ’s exposure to porn to the sex attack			1
he also criticised the boy ’s parents who , even after the offence , allowed their son to carry on accessing the internet with virtually no form of restriction			1
the case comes amid the @entity37 ’s on - going @entity36 campaign to protect children from graphic images			0
@entity41 ’s top sex crimes prosecutor , @entity40 , has recently warned that online filth is fuelling a rise in sex offending by children			1
the 14 - year - old , who was spared a custodial sentence , forced the girl to perform a sex act on him at his home during the school holidays			1
she later told the boy ’s mother , a childminder , what had happened			2
the youth initially denied the accusations but confessed after dna evidence came to light			0
he eventually admitted raping the child			0
at a hearing earlier this year , the @entity62 teenager admitted the offence , which happened last august			1
he was referred to the children ’s reporter and his behaviour will be monitored under the @entity67 set up to deal with sex offenders			2
campaign : the @entity37 has called for internet service providers to block online porn unless users ' opt in ' his name has already been added to the sex offenders ’ register and he will be subject to random checks by social workers and police for any devices capable of online access			1
@entity81 , defending , said the accused ’s parents had tried but failed to put a parental lock on their internet account			2
they had handed back their son ’s @entity18 , @entity19 and mobile phone ‘ on trust ’ after the offence			1
he said : ‘ his bedroom door was n’t to be closed and they frequently visited his room to make sure he was n’t accessing pornography			0
but he breached his parents ’ trust			0
’ unrestricted : the boy , 14 , has free rein to watch online porn ( picture posed by model ) passing sentence at the @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 , judge @entity20 criticised the parents , who wept during the hearing			1
he told the boy : ‘ the whole circumstances , i have to say , do n’t reflect well upon your parents and i have no doubt that they are aware of the element of responsibility that they must take for this shameful event			2
’ describing his offence as ‘ highly serious ’ , he went on : ‘ you are a young boy but you became obsessed with pornography through the internet and were able to access that freely			2
the result of that obsession , it appears , caused you to commit this crime			0
’ last night , @entity127 chief whip @entity126 said : ‘ parents will be worried that this child will only be subjected to random checks			0
something far more robust is needed to ensure his behaviour does not escalate as he gets older			0
’ earlier this year , mrs @entity40 warned that the availability of sexual imagery ‘ must have some effect on the attitudes ’ of young people			0
@entity138 , of the @entity140 charity , said : ‘ online pornography can give young people a skewed idea of sex and relationships			0
