by @entity0 @entity1 is set for a sensational £ 16million move to @entity3 , returning to the @entity4 after an explosive spell at @entity6			1
we asked @entity0 of @entity10 - tinted website @entity8 to explain why he wants the madcap striker at @entity12			0
a few weeks ago , @entity3 manager @entity13 spoke quite plainly when asked about the possibility of signing @entity1 , saying ' he is a wonderful player , but an @entity18 player , i just gave my opinion of him , but does n’t mean i will be signing him			1
' this , of course , followed some pretty pointed praise for the @entity18 player but @entity13 could not have made his intentions any more clear			0
how things can move so quickly though			0
as of thursday morning there are reports that @entity1 's agent is on the way to @entity30 for talks with the club after a fee was agreed			2
all this in barely 24 hours			0
he 's a superb player with unlimited potential and still only 24			1
for a striker of his ability , record and potential the £ 16million fee is a snip			2
but even the most ardent fan would have to admit that there is a very tangible reason why @entity3 would become his fifth professional club of his career - he 's often more trouble than he 's worth			1
how else would @entity60 's @entity59 , top - class striker be available for less than £ 20million ? from setting off fireworks in his home to training ground fracas , nothing is ever straightforward with @entity1			1
one minute he 's taking the opposition by storm , the next he 's getting sent off			1
in many ways , @entity3 fans can see parallels between @entity72 and @entity1 and depending on how you feel about him that is either a bad thing or enough of a reason to buy him			1
personally , i 'm torn			0
on the one hand , he is a star of near endless potential with personal issues , in much the way @entity72 was when we signed him			0
at the time , many had similar reservations , considering he had not long entered a ban for his first biting incident			0
@entity87 : there are similarities between @entity1 and @entity72 stats : @entity1 's @entity4 record ( via @entity91 ) on the other hand , @entity13 has fostered a very unique dressing room atmosphere at @entity3			1
one which , only just last season , bore its first fruit when the club challenged for its first title in years			0
if @entity13 ca n't get a handle on @entity1 from day one , he could very well cause the club to implode			2
you also have to consider how young the @entity3 squad is , how many personalities there are that a player like @entity1 could potentially influence			1
but does this necessarily have to be a bad thing ? of course not			0
while i 'm torn , there 's no denying he 's a more attractive option than @entity112 or @entity113 , both as a player and financially			2
and while my head says @entity117 is a better option , he is also 28 and for the reported loan fee of £ 10million for 12 months we could almost fund a permanent move for @entity1			2
perhaps we could take a leaf out of @entity124 's book and add a clause similar to their reported ( although farcical , if true ) ' no more biting ' clause ? regardless , most @entity128 seem delirious at the thought and , i admit , as the rumours grow i 'm becoming more enamoured of the idea , particularly as he 'd still represent a top striker and more importantly a signal of intent			1
video new @entity3 signings were excellent - @entity137			0

most @entity3 fans are delirious at thought of signing @entity1
striker is a superb player with unlimited potential
however , @entity1 is often trouble for his clubs
one minute he 's taking the opposition apart , the next he 's being sent off
