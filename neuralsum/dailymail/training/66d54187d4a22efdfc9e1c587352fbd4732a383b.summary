the 4 - year - old has been playing golf since he was two @entity8 was born with a love of golf and is able to drive the ball more than 70 yards he now plays nine hole rounds of golf twice a week and practices up to six times a week @entity8 pictured left with a trophy he won at a junior golfing competition last month , and right , on the fairway his mother @entity30 said : ' he started with plastic clubs when he was about 15 months old			1
he was crawling around the house hitting the balls – even before he was walking			2
' mrs @entity30 and her husband @entity34 did n't think the early fascination with golf would turn into anything special , even though their son - who was still in diapers - would putt across the house losing dozens of golf balls under sofas , chairs , and tv stands			1
' right when we got him real clubs , he started teeing off balls from the tee – immediately , ' mrs @entity30 said			1
' he was making contact with every ball , i mean it was amazing			0
' when @entity8 was just two , the @entity8 decided to book him for golf lessons			1
mrs @entity30 said : ' i contacted golf pro , @entity57 , at @entity58 – where he plays			2
he took him out for the first time and could n't believe how he was immediately making contact			0
' his instructor put a blanket out in front of him and was astounded that @entity8 was able to hit every ball off the tee and make it onto the blanket – which was 50 yards away			1
' he did n't know what to expect when i called him and said : " can you take someone this young ? " ' the first time on the course he was chipping in the air – and putting was natural for him			0
@entity57 told me that day – you really need to keep him in this ! ' @entity8 has had his real golf clubs for more than a year now			1
poise : @entity8 , 4 , teeing off during a tournament in @entity79 last month @entity8 ( pictured ) loved playing with plastic golf clubs as a baby and would hit balls before he could even walk @entity8 , pictured during a tournament last month ( left ) and at home as a toddler ( right )			1
he was born with a natural ability to hit the ball his mother @entity30 , pictured , said she will continue to take him to golf as long as he continues enjoying it @entity8 , pictured left and right , even practices his chipping in the backyard and in his playhouse he plays a nine hole round once or twice a week , and practices at the course 4 days a week			1
mrs @entity30 said : ' honestly , @entity8 will practice 6 days a week			1
it 's rare he will take a day off			0
i have to tell him , ' we 're taking this day off			0

he is so accurate with his aim – it is unreal			0
he 'll chip balls in his bedroom ; he just loves it			2
' last month he competed in the @entity113 in @entity79 - although it is hard for the @entity8 family to find tournaments where he can actually play against kids his own age			2
@entity119 , co-owner of the @entity113 , said she was amazed how he struck the ball with ' no thought '			0
she added : ' some kids seemed to be over-coached , where he seems to be hand - eye coordinated and just goes up and hits the ball			0

' i did enjoy how relaxed his family is			0
