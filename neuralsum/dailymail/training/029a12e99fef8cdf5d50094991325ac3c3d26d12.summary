@entity0 has apparently chosen sides in the pitched battle between @entity4 's mayor and his police commissioner – and mayor @entity6 came out on the losing end			1
the @entity8 said sunday that the president called @entity11 @entity10 – but not @entity6 – during the @entity0 family 's extended @entity13 vacation to offer ' his full support for any possible assistance in the days and weeks ahead			1
' the president then left his vacation home to play golf			0
@entity20 and @entity10 have been at each other 's throats since saturday 's cold - blooded murder of two beat cops in @entity25			1
@entity57 , 28 , the gunman who killed the officers over the weekend , suggested on his @entity59 account that his double - murder was retaliation for the deaths of @entity53 and @entity63 , shot to death by an officer in @entity66 , @entity67			1
both of the dead men were black			0
' i 'm putting wings on pigs today , ' @entity57 wrote ' they take 1 of ours , let 's take 2 of theirs			0
' @entity57 killed himself on a subway platform shortly after firing into the closed window of a patrol car , killing officers @entity80 and @entity82			0
while the administration was quick to publicize the president 's call with @entity10 , it has been mum about any @entity6 sightings on his calendar			1
@entity89 : officers @entity82 ( left ) and @entity80 ( right ) were shot and killed saturday in the @entity25 borough of @entity4			1
the suspect , 28 - year - old @entity57 , ran to a subway station and killed himself actor and @entity96 nominee @entity94 tweeted broadsides at @entity98 and mayor @entity6 over the weekend , including this image showing the mayor ( center ) making his way through a police gauntlet at a @entity25 hospital while cops on both sides of the hallway turned their backs on him the @entity8 has not responded to questions from @entity110 about whether @entity0 has spoken with @entity6 at all since saturday			1
@entity0 followed his call to @entity10 with a shortened round of golf and an afternoon on the beach at @entity115 on the @entity117 island of @entity118			1
a @entity8 pool reporter described ' a 20 - minute drive through scenic lush @entity118 countryside ringed by mountains ' on the way from the golf course to the @entity0 family 's beach hideaway			1
the president 's golfing foursome on sunday included @entity8 deputy political strategy and outreach director @entity130 , intellectual property attorney @entity131 , and longtime friend @entity132			2
@entity132 attracted unwanted attention in 2011 when he was arrested for soliciting an undercover @entity135 police officer for sex , thinking she was a prostitute , during a sting operation			0
he pleaded no contest to the charge and six months later it was removed from his record , according to the terms of a court agreement			0
if @entity0 has actively chosen sides in the @entity146 tiff , it would signal a critical loss of support for the embattled mayor			2
republicans including former @entity4 governor @entity151 have sided with police commissioner @entity10 over @entity6 -- the same choice president @entity0 seems to have made after the far - left mayor offered support for liberal protesters who disagreed with a grand jury decision to clear the officer who killed @entity53 , hundreds of @entity4 police signed petitions circulated by their union that ask @entity6 to stay away from their funerals if they die in the line of duty			1
on saturday , hours after @entity80 and @entity82 were pronounced dead , @entity6 visited the @entity166 to pay his respects			2
dozens of police on hand physically turned their backs on him as he walked down a long , cop - lined corridor on his way to meet the fallen officers ' families			0
presidents of the @entity178 and the @entity179 , the two largest police unions , both participated in the show of disdain			0
@entity10 , the police commissioner , told @entity185 's today show that the display of frustration was the wrong signal to send at the wrong time			1
' i do n’t think it was appropriate , particularly in that setting , but it ’s reflective of the anger of some of them , ' he said			0
police unions , however , are united in the full - throated condemnation of the mayor			2
' mayor @entity6 , the blood of these two officers is clearly on your hands , ” sergeants association president @entity200 said in a statement saturday night			1
' it is your failed policies and actions that enabled this tragedy to occur			0
i only hope and pray that more of these ambushes and executions do not happen again			0
' @entity214 waters : five time zones away from @entity4 , the president is protected by @entity217 on land and the @entity219 in the ocean as he golfs , dines and shops with the first lady and their children the president of the patrolman 's union , @entity228 , has also issued scathing criticism of @entity6 for failing to offer support to two police lieutenants who were assaulted during protests at the @entity233 following the grand jury decision in the @entity53 case			1
' that blood on the hands starts at the steps of @entity239 , in the office of the mayor , ' @entity228 said late saturday			2
' after the funerals , those responsible will be called on the carpet and held accountable			0
' @entity4 @entity246 congressman @entity245 slammed the unions in a rare show of anti-labor sentiment from onw of @entity252 's most liberal lawmakers			0
' they should be conducting interviews , mourning those that they lost and their family , talking about " how do insane people get firearms ? " and not criticizing – but seeing how we can stop insane people from getting an opportunity to get firearms to kill anybody , ' he said on @entity266 's ' @entity265			0
' ' two human beings were shot dead , we should not be pointing fingers at the mayor of the city of @entity4			2

a @entity285 man executed two @entity25 police officers in their *squad* car on saturday in apparent retaliation for the deaths of *criminal* suspects @entity63 in @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity53 in @entity4
