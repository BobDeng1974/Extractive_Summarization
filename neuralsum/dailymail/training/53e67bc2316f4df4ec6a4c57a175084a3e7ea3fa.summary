@entity0 , the tea - party - darling former @entity1 governor who ran for vice president in 2008 , is leaving the door open for a presidential run in 2016 , but mostly hawking a soon - to - premiere tv show			1
as the final speaker at the @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity0 praised conservative leaders and trashed president @entity11 , including a political smack-fest hidden in a dr. @entity15 - style children 's rhyme			1
' i do not like this , @entity18			1
i do not like his health care scam , ' she recited in a sing - song voice			1
' i do not like these dirty crooks , or how they lie and cook the books			0
i do not like when @entity24 steals			0
i do not like their crony deals			0
i do not like this spying , man			0
i do not like " oh , yes we can			0
" ' the effort won her cheers of ' run , @entity34 , @entity35 ' from some of the more than 1,000 activists who stayed at the @entity8 event until the bitter end			0
at one point @entity54 read ' @entity61 ' to his children over live television at their bedtime			2
@entity0 fed red meat to her fans , insisting that ' @entity68 , ' and ' yes we can ' has become ' no you ca n't ' under president @entity11			1
' no you ca n't log on to the website , no you ca n't keep your health care , no you ca n't make a phone call without @entity75 knowing , ' she jabbed			1
in between snipes at the president 's ' dopey wobbling on the world stage ' and his pledge that he had @entity81 on the run – ' yea , possibly toward us , ' she said – @entity0 carped about the @entity86 's economic record and projected a @entity88 - led future recovery enabled by tea party insurgents			1
' their agenda is failure and fiasco on steroids , ' she said of the @entity95			0
' so @entity96 is counting on the @entity88 to get it right			0
' ' the age of @entity11 is almost over – the end of an error , ' she said , to chuckles and hoots			0
' he is the lamest of lame ducks			0
' non-stop party : the @entity8 brings together conservatives , politicians , pundits and voters for three days of speeches and workshops @entity0 said she would ' never say never ' to running for president in 2016 the @entity114 will launch a new @entity0 - hosted program in april , and is marketing her as the ultimate patriotic mass - communicator @entity11 ' promised jobs for the jobless , but fewer people work today than when the peanut farmer was president , ' she said , referring to president @entity122 's 1970s economic malaise			1
' he promised to heal the planet , stop the rise of the oceans , ' @entity0 mocked			2
' but the planet is not listening to " dr. @entity11			2
" ' ' the only thing rising in his la - la land is the @entity131 empire			2
' ' i 'm probably being too hard on the president , ' she sniped			2
' after all , who could have seen this coming ? ' @entity0 made headlines this week after @entity131 @entity137 sent troops across the @entity140 border into the @entity142 region – a development she predicted in 2008 as a consequence of an @entity11 presidency , to a chorus of head - shaking from foreign - policy journalists			1
@entity54 read from the children 's classic ' @entity61 ' during his @entity149 filibuster in 2013 -- an event that @entity0 reprised with @entity151 rhymes in place of dr. @entity15 ' verses			1
@entity0 is expected to deliver a crowd - pleasing red - meat speech to close the @entity8 ' i 'm usually not one to @entity157 , ' she gloated on @entity158 , ' but i did , despite my accurate prediction being derided as “ an extremely far - fetched scenario ” by the “ high - brow ” @entity161			1
@entity8 is an annual event that features speeches and glad - handing from potential @entity88 presidential candidates like @entity165 , the @entity166 senator who won the event 's informal straw with a 31 per cent showing in a large field , easily besting @entity55 sen. @entity54 , who placed second with 11 per cent			2
on friday night , @entity0 appeared on the @entity170 , fielding questions about whether she has presidential ambitions of her own following her loss two presidential elections ago as a vice presidential nominee			1
' it depends on what it is that @entity96 really , really want in a candidate , ' the politician - turned - media - gadfly told host @entity179			1
' if they want a fighter , if they want someone who can so respect our exceptionalism , everything that makes @entity96 great , the promise of @entity96			0
and if we do n't find that , then i would run			0
' ' it does n't have to be me , ' @entity0 said			2
' i do think that there are so many @entity96 who feel like i feel , and they 're capable			0
they 're willing and able to serve			0
' watch the latest video at @entity193 @entity0 's star rose quickly in 2008 when @entity88 presidential nominee sen. @entity195 chose her as his running mate @entity0 and @entity195 failed the electoral - college test by a wide margin but claimed popular vote victories ( shown in red ) in a vast majority of @entity96 counties asked who her favorite presidential hopefuls are so far , she singled out @entity55 sen. @entity54 and @entity166 sen. @entity165 while adding that ' some would say we need to stay clear of those who have followed a conventional political path			1
maybe they are part of the problem			0
' but when @entity212 cornered @entity0 on her own @entity86 ambitions , she said ' i 'll never say never			2
' ' at this point in time , ' she cautioned , ' i do n't have a team of people , you know , getting out there doing these poll - tested – whatever they do – to let you know if you should run or not			2
i do n't have any of that kind of organization going			0
' @entity225 correspondent @entity224 sniped at the idea of a @entity0 presidential run last month , saying on the air that if she ran it would be for ' a financial reason , to get back into the spotlight			2
get the speaking fees back up			0
' the @entity8 near @entity9 was awash with @entity0 paraphernalia but right - wing activists at the @entity8 , held this week near the nation 's capital , are eager to toss her back onto the political roulette wheel			1
' are you kidding ? ' attendee @entity238 told @entity240			2
' she may not ever get elected to anything else again , but at least she pushes the rest of the candidates to be more conservative – and not to shy away from the things that make us conservatives			0
' @entity0 rose to national prominence when @entity88 presidential candidate sen. @entity195 of @entity249 tapped her as his running mate in 2008			1
president @entity11 and vice president @entity251 defeated the two handily , winning in a 365 – 173 electoral vote drubbing			0
four years later , she resigned her job as @entity1 governor , citing the expense and distraction of fighting ' frivolous ' ethics charges related to the firing of the state 's public safety commissioner			1
still , her statewide approval ratings never dipped below 53 per cent			0
@entity0 's name is everywhere at the @entity8 event , from giving the annual event 's final speech to promoting the april premiere of her new show ' @entity268 ' on the @entity114			1
in another @entity170 appearance in march , she slammed president @entity11 for what she said was a tepid response to @entity131 's invasion of @entity140 's @entity142			1
' people are looking at @entity137 as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil , ' @entity0 told host @entity279			1
' they look at our president as one who wears mom jeans			0

the former *vp* candidate told @entity170 host @entity179 that she will ' never say never ' to running for president
@entity0 is *constantly* *stoking* the fires to maintain her public *profile* as a national media figure
more rock star than policy wonk , @entity0 was the final speaker at the @entity294
' i do not like this , @entity18 . i do not like his health care scam , ' she read , dr. @entity15 - style
she *famously* resigned the governorship of @entity1 in 2010 , citing the cost and distraction of fighting what she called ' frivolous ' ethics charges
