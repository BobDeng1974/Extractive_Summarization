powerful cctv cameras which can recognise and track faces from more than half a mile away could breach human rights laws , a top @entity4 adviser has warned			1
the @entity6 's first surveillance commissioner , @entity5 , has issued a stark warning to the government by saying that advances in cctv technology risk turning @entity6 into a @entity12 society			1
he warned of a ' public backlash ' unless proper steps were taken to regulate the proliferation of 16 - megapixel hd cameras with the potential to pick out a face and then match it against a database of images of wanted people			1
watched : the new cctv cameras could breach human right 's laws due to their advanced technology futuristic : this graphic shows how the advanced cctv technology works mr @entity5 said the cameras are being rolled out up and down @entity6 cities without members of the public being consulted			1
‘ the technology has overtaken our ability to regulate it , ’ he told the @entity33			2
‘ i 'm convinced that if we do n't regulate it properly - ie the technological ability to use millions of images we capture - there will be a huge public backlash			1
‘ it is the @entity12 scenario playing out large			2
it 's the ability to pick out your face in a crowd from a camera which is probably half a mile away			0
’ research being carried out into automatic facial recognition technology by the @entity49 has achieved a 90 per cent success rate and is still improving , mr @entity5 said			1
big brother : mr @entity5 warns that the high definition cameras ' ability to perform facial recognition is an intrusion into the public 's privacy			1
this is a file picture of a @entity60 operations room he is expected to report back to @entity61 with any concerns over how @entity63 and automatic number plate recognition systems are being used			0
his concerns were today echoed by civil liberties campaign group @entity12			2
however , the organisation claimed mr @entity5 needed to be given more power from the government to clampdown on @entity63			2
@entity70 , director of privacy and civil liberties at the campaign group said : ' the commissioner is absolutely right to warn about the risks of new cctv technology			1
' however , the @entity49 has undermined the commissioner from the start by giving him absolutely no powers to do anything			0
' proper regulation of @entity63 needs someone to have the power to inspect cameras and punish those breaking the law			0
if the @entity49 is serious about this issue then the surveillance camera commissioner needs proper powers to protect our privacy			2
' support : civil liberties campaign group @entity12 also echoed mr @entity5 's concerns			1

he told the @entity33 : ‘ i do n't want the state to carry on and start pushing the boundaries			0
let 's have a debate - if the public support it , then fine			0
‘ ' if the public do n't support it , and we need to increase the regulation , then that 's what we need to do			0
' a @entity49 spokesperson said : ' used properly , @entity63 can be a valuable tool in the fight against crime			0
but for too long the system has grown and developed in the absence of any proper framework or oversight			0
' that is why we ’ve appointed @entity5 as the @entity129 to drive the adoption of a new code of practice			0
he will empower the public to shine a light on those who operate camera systems in public places , challenging them to show the use of these systems is justified , proportionate and effective			0
