by @entity1 reporter published : 21:54 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 09:14 est , 13 december 2013 battle - fatigued and suddenly bipartisan , the @entity2 voted on thursday night to ease across - the - board federal spending cuts and head off future government shutdowns , acting after speaker @entity5 unleashed a stinging attack on tea party - aligned conservative groups campaigning for the measure 's defeat			1
the legislation , backed by the @entity2 , cleared on a vote of 332 - 94 , with lopsided majorities of @entity14 and @entity15 alike voting in favor			1
final passage is expected next week in the @entity18			0
the events in the @entity2 gave a light coating of bipartisan cooperation to the end of a bruising year of divided government - memorable for a partial government shutdown , flirtation with an unprecedented @entity27 default and gridlock on immigration , gun control and other items on president @entity33 's second - term agenda			1
' minutes after the budget action , the @entity2 approved a broad military policy bill that aims to curb sexual assaults , cover combat pay for @entity52 forces and fund new aircraft and ships			2
that vote , too , was lopsided , 350 - 69 , sending the bill to the @entity18 , which plans to adjourn for the year next week			2
in the end , the budget debate in the @entity2 was tame by comparison with @entity5 's criticism of @entity14 - favoring outside groups that at times have been more of an obstacle to him than @entity15			1
' i think they 're misleading their followers , ' the @entity14 speaker said of the groups , whom he pointedly also blamed for last fall 's politically damaging partial government shutdown			1
' i think they 're pushing our members in places where they do n't want to be			0
and frankly , i just think that they 've lost all credibility by opposing legislation before the details are known			2
' sen. @entity80 , center , helped to negotiate the budget agreement which will set overall spending levels for the current budget year and the one that begins on oct. 1 , 2014 he mentioned no organizations by name , although it appeared he was referring to @entity90 and @entity91 , both of which have sought to push the @entity2 further to the right than the @entity14 leadership has been willing to go			2
rep. @entity96 , @entity97 , a chief @entity14 architect of the deal , made the conservatives ' case for support			2
the measure ' reduces the deficit by $ 23 billion			2
it does not raise taxes and it cuts spending in a smarter way , ' said the @entity109 's chairman , whose handiwork could well be challenged in the 2016 @entity14 presidential primaries			2
the second - ranking @entity112 , rep. @entity113 of @entity114 , joined other party leaders in swinging behind the measure , even though he noted that he represents 62,000 federal workers and said future government employees will pay higher pensions costs because of the bill			1
' this agreement is better than the alternative ' of ever deeper across - the - board cuts , he said			2
the agreement , negotiated by @entity96 and @entity15 sen. @entity80 of @entity43 - and endorsed by the @entity2 - would set overall spending levels for the current budget year and the one that begins on oct. 1 , 2014			1
rep. @entity96 , @entity97 , a chief @entity14 architect of the deal , made the conservatives ' case for support that straightforward action would probably eliminate the possibility of another government shutdown and reduce the opportunity for the periodic brinkmanship of the kind that has flourished in the current three - year era of divided government			1
the measure would erase $ 63 billion in across - the - board cuts set for january and early 2015 on domestic and defense programs , leaving about $ 140 billion in reductions in place			1
on the other side of the budget ledger , it projects savings totaling $ 85 billion over the coming decade , enough to show a deficit reduction of about $ 23 billion over the 10 - year period			1
the cuts would be replaced with savings generated from dozens of sources			0
among them are higher airline security fees , curbs on the pension benefits of new federal workers and additional costs for corporations whose pensions are guaranteed by the federal government			2
the measure also would slow the annual cost - of - living increase in benefits for military retirees under the age of 62			1
the bill includes a 90 - day provision that postpones a 20 percent cut in reimbursements for doctors who treat @entity174 patients and replaces it with an increase of one - half of one percent			0
without naming names , @entity5 pointedly also blamed tea party - aligned conservative groups for last fall 's politically damaging partial government shutdown the combination of short - term spending increases and long - term savings would send deficits higher for the current budget year and each of the next two , a dramatic departure from the conservative orthodoxy that @entity14 have enforced since taking control of the @entity2 three years ago			1
that was a step too far for many republicans , including some seeking election to the @entity18 next year			0
rep. @entity192 of @entity193 , one of several @entity18 hopefuls from his state , said he would vote against the legislation			0
he said the existing across - the - board cuts ' have a tendency to cut out muscle with fat , but it 's still the only tool in town for cutting spending			1
' rep. @entity203 , who is challenging @entity15 sen. @entity204 of @entity205 , announced his opposition , too , and said the legislation ' busts the spending caps that took effect just months ago by spending billions now in exchange for supposed long - term spending cuts			0
' other republicans said despite shortcomings , the bill was the best the party could get in divided government			2
' we have @entity14 and @entity15 - controlled houses and as a result no one solution is possible , ' said rep. @entity221 of @entity222			0
echoing @entity5 's sentiments , he said of the outside groups , ' what do they want , another government shutdown ? if so , they ought to run for @entity228			1
' @entity33 's press secretary , @entity39 , hailed the vote , saying it ' shows @entity43 can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done ' democrats were conflicted , but for different reasons			0
there was general support for easing across - the - board reductions in programs like education , @entity243 and transportation - deficit reduction that rep. @entity245 of @entity246 called a disaster			0
yet @entity15 were unhappy that the measure lacked an extension of unemployment benefits due to expire on dec. 28			0
rep. @entity251 of @entity114 asked for a separate vote on that issue , but republicans refused			0
the expiring program provides benefits to unemployed workers who have been without work for more than 26 weeks			0
the cost of a one - year extension was put at $ 25 billion			0
the debate on the @entity2 floor was overshadowed by @entity5 's comments at his news conference			1
the speaker , who famously says he is not affected by stress , has been criticized by some republicans this year who accuse him of buckling under pressure from outside groups and their allies in the rank and file			2
he was elected to a second term as speaker in january after an attempt by some rebels to oust him collapsed			0
@entity2 majority whip @entity278 , @entity279 , leaves the chamber on thursday evening just before the @entity2 held final votes before leaving for the holiday recess , at the @entity283 in @entity43 the october shutdown seemed on @entity5 's mind			1
' they pushed us into this fight to defund " @entity290 " and to shut down the government			0
... that was n't exactly the strategy that i had in mind , ' he said			0
' but if you recall , the day before the government reopened , one of the people that - one of these groups stood up and said , well , we never really thought it would work			1
are you kidding me ? ' @entity5 's remarks were part of a broader response by the @entity14 establishment as it struggles to counter the influence of organizations like @entity90 , the @entity91 , and the @entity309			1
the @entity18 @entity14 campaign organization , effectively an extension of the leadership , let it be known it would not give any business to @entity314 , an advertising firm that has worked for the @entity309			0
@entity14 officials have urged traditional political allies like the @entity52 @entity317 to step up their involvement in campaigns as a way to counter the influence of tea party - aligned groups , and in one or two cases , have noted with satisfaction that particularly hard - line rebels in the @entity2 will face primary challengers next year			1
@entity5 said the @entity14 leadership has had enough tea party - driven intransigence in @entity228 and he doesn ' Â­ t care what they think @entity333 , a spokesman for @entity90 , rebuffed @entity5 's accusation that opposition to the legislation was uninformed			1
' everything was widely known about what this deal was			0
we were concerned it was going to increase spending in the near term , and it does			0
we were concerned it was going to increase deficits in the near term and it does			0
' the @entity91 issued a statement that took no note of @entity5 's comments			1
it urged lawmakers to oppose the legislation , calling it ' a deliberate attempt to avoid modest but much needed spending cuts in exchange for the promise of spending cuts in the future			0
