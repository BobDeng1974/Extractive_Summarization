a @entity1 politician says @entity3 ceo @entity2 ' should be banned ' from entering the country after he came out as gay for the first time			1
@entity8 campaigner @entity7 reportedly suggested that head of the electronics giant could bring ' the ebola virus , @entity12 or gonorrhea ' , drawing on his stereotypes of homosexuals			1
according to @entity18 , the city legislator from @entity17 said : ' what could he [ @entity2 ] bring us ? the ebola virus , @entity12 , gonorrhea ? they all have unseemly ties over there			1
the 53 - year - old , said he had been open with many people about his sexuality for years but wanted to maintain a level of privacy in the public sphere			2
however , in a first - person article for @entity46 , he said he hopes coming out will inspire people to insist on their right to equality - and that is ' worth the trade - off with my own privacy '			2
the declaration makes mr cook the highest - profile business ceo to have come out as being gay			1
writing in @entity46 mr @entity2 wrote : ' let me be clear : i 'm proud to be gay , and i consider being gay among the greatest gifts @entity39 has given me			1
' being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day			2
' it 's made me more empathetic , which has led to a richer life			0
' mr @entity2 , pictured at @entity70 on june 29 , said coming out was n't ' an easy choice ' because he guarded his privacy but ' if hearing that the ceo of @entity3 is gay can help someone , then it 's worth the trade - off with my own privacy ' he added : ' if hearing that the ceo of @entity3 is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is , or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone , or inspire people to insist on their equality , then it 's worth the trade - off with my own privacy			1
' part of social progress , mr @entity2 explained , is understanding that a person is not defined by singular characteristics like their sexuality , and urged readers to remember that he is also engineer , an uncle , a nature lover , a fitness nut , a son of the @entity97 , a sports fanatic , and many other things			1
but he conceded that he is part of a minority that could greatly benefit from his support			0
throughout the 800 - word essay , mr @entity2 describes a ' tough and uncomfortable ' existence at times from his ' humble roots ' in @entity107 to global success in @entity109			1
@entity110 , he said , ' has changed so much since i was a kid ' and is moving towards equality , something helped by brave public figures that had come out and changed public perceptions			0
a tweet from mr @entity2 on june 29 congratulating his thousands of employees who part in the gay pride parade nonetheless , with laws still in place across the @entity110 that make sexuality a sack - able offense , he said being gay has given him a ' deeper understanding ' of what it means to be a minority			1
it had also made him more confident in his own identity , helped him ' rise above adversity and bigotry ' and to develop the ' skin of a rhinoceros ' that it takes to run a company like @entity3			0
the motivation to write this article was inspired by the pictures on his office wall of @entity138 and dr @entity139 , who said : ' life 's most persistent and urgent question is , ' what are you doing for others ? '' while not considering himself an ' activist ' , mr @entity2 said he realizes how much he had benefited from the ' sacrifice of others ' so knew he needed to speak out			1
he said @entity3 had long advocated for human rights and equality			0
for example , he lists @entity3 's support of a workplace equality bill before @entity154 , and of marriage equality in @entity156			0
in february , the company issued a public appeal to the state of @entity160 urging them to abandon an anti-gay bill that would permit discrimination on religious grounds			0
the company , he said , holds up dr @entity139 and @entity138 as icons for that ideal			0
mr @entity2 wrote : ' i do n't pretend that writing this puts me in their league			1
' all it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that i 'm doing my part , however small , to help others			0
' we pave the sunlit path toward justice together , brick by brick			0
' in june , shortly before mr @entity2 attended @entity183 's 44th annual @entity182 , he was accidentally outed on a @entity185 current affairs show live on - air			1

speaking about how former ceo of @entity202 became the first person at a @entity205 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay , mr @entity194 said there 's a ' corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going public			2
' he said : ' you 'd think @entity200 especially are measured by objective criteria , financial performance			0
mr @entity194 then went on to say that he had contacted a number of @entity200 for a comment for his story and received a ' very cool reception '			2
then co-host mr @entity189 piped up , saying , ' i think @entity2 is fairly open about the fact he 's gay at the head of @entity3 , is n't he ? ' for a moment , a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts looked awkwardly from one to the other before mr @entity194 , shaking his head in disapproval , responds with a succinct , ' no.
