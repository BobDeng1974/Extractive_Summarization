by @entity0 cat owners fear a killer is on the loose after six pets in the same street were killed with antifreeze in one week			1
the @entity6 has launched an investigation over the string of poisonings in @entity10 , a quiet terrace in @entity12 , @entity13 , with so many pets it is nicknamed ' cat street '			1
residents and the charity believe an assassin has used antifreeze deliberately in an act of spite - risking jail or a £ 20,000 fine			1
the owners say they have heard mysterious noises in the dead of night and have found seedlings soaked in a luminous liquid , which they have passed to the @entity6 as evidence			1
peace shattered : @entity10 , a quiet terrace in @entity12 , @entity13 ( left ) , has so many pets it is nicknamed ' cat street ' - but they are being killed in quick succession with antifreeze			1
one victim was @entity37 ( right ) devastating : @entity38 mayor , 34 , had to take three - year - old male @entity39 ( pictured ) to the vet to be put down one resident , carer @entity41 , 34 , had to take three - year - old male @entity39 to the vet after he appeared to be ‘ drunk ’ and was struggling to walk			1
she and her daughter @entity43 , 17 , were told he had been poisoned and he was put down on june 21			2
' @entity39 was n’t just a cat , he was the love of my life , ' she said			2
' i got him when my mother died and he cheered me up and just became part of the family			0
' he was my little boy			0
i ’m devastated by what ’s happened			0
' the cases have been adding up and up			0
we knew there were six but we think there could be eight or nine now			0
' @entity43 added : ' people call this street " cat street " because there ’s so many people that have cats			1
victims : @entity41 and her daughter @entity43 lost their three - year - old male @entity39 to antifreeze ' someone must be doing it deliberately			1
who would be using antifreeze in june ? ' another owner , @entity69 , 44 , had to watch her 14 - year - old long - haired tabby diesel having a fit before dying last thursday			1
' i 'm absolutely horrified and devastated , ' she said			0
' she was sitting there on the floor with black stuff coming out of her mouth			0
i could n't watch '			0
' i 'm absolutely horrified and devastated			0
she was sitting there on the floor with black stuff coming out of her mouth			0
i could n't watch ' - @entity69 on losing her tabby @entity37 , 14 used as an engine coolant , antifreeze is highly toxic to cats , which can be killed by drinking just a small amount			1
it is far more dangerous than other poisons because cats are attracted to its sweet taste and symptoms can only begin hours after ingestion			0
they react to its main ingredient ethylene glycol , which is also poisonous to humans and causes a host of symptons include the loss of muscle control , vomiting and seizures			0
it would not by any means be the first deliberate poisoning attack on cats			0
previous cases have seen antifreeze used in acts of revenge against cats who prowl neighbours ' gardens unwanted , or simply in sadistic killings			2
owners in @entity115 , @entity116 , were horrified in january after nine of their cats died in a single week			2
as well as investigating the events in @entity10 , the @entity6 is probing other recent cat deaths in the nearby towns of @entity121 and @entity122			1
inspector @entity123 said : ' this is an extremely serious offence and offenders will face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £ 20,000 if and when we catch them			0
appalled : @entity69 had to watch her 14 - year - old long - haired tabby @entity37 having a fit before dying ' this is a horrendous act of cruelty against pets that are much - loved and it will not be tolerated			1
' we also want to urge all cat owners in these areas to be vigilant and to look out for the symptoms of poisoning			1
' cats often look as though they are drunk and struggle to move around as normal			2
' if anyone notices any of these symptoms , please get your cat to the vets straight away			2
' once cats have ingested antifreeze , they deteriorate quickly and will be dead in 24 hours if not treated immediately			2
' anyone with any information on the poisonings should call the @entity6 on 0300 1234 999 .			1
