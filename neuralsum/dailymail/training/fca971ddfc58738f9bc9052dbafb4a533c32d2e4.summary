by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:15 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:50 est , 25 december 2013 the federal website has revealed that it received 2 million visits on monday , and heavy - but not as heavy - traffic on tuesday after announcing a later enrollment deadline			1
a @entity8 spokeswoman said there was no immediate estimate of visitors or how many succeeded in obtaining insurance before the deadline , nor did they explain who will receive the extension and how long they will be given to try again before facing fines			0
it was the administration 's latest attempt to move the goalposts as it tries to recover from technical failures and political missteps that dogged the enrollment drive after it opened on october 1			2
trying to make up for lost time , the administration has announced a series of last - minute changes and delays to get as many people as possible covered under the @entity31			0
a computer screen reads , ' enroll by dec. 23 for coverage starting as soon as @entity34 ' before monday 's rush , more than 1 million people had signed up for private coverage through @entity38 - which serves 36 states - and 14 state - run marketplaces , according to state and federal estimates			1
the figure , though likely to climb by @entity43 , is still short of previous estimates that 7 million people could enroll by the end of march , the last date to obtain health insurance coverage in 2014			1
about one - third or more will need to be young , healthy adults whose payments into the system would help offset the costs of covering older , sicker people			0
' sometimes despite your best efforts , you might have run into delays caused by heavy traffic to @entity38 , maintenance periods , or other issues with our systems that prevented you from finishing the process on time , ' tuesday 's blog post on @entity38 said			2
' if this happened to you , do n't worry - we still may be able to help you get covered as soon as january 1			1
' the problematic rollout of the health law known as @entity31 , which was passed in 2010 and survived legal challenges , helped send @entity73 's popularity ratings to record lows and stepped up @entity76 efforts to gut the law and use it against @entity78 in 2014 congressional elections			2
trying to make it work : president @entity73 , seen here at his last press conference of the year , has dedicated much of his presidency to enacting the health care legislation and @entity76 rivals plan to run against it in the midterms the more recent changes , which the administration has said are intended to show flexibility , have introduced a new element of confusion for consumers as well as the health insurance companies who have been pressed by the government to allow new members to pay , and even sign up , past january 1 for retroactive coverage			1
so far the industry has agreed to extend the first payment deadline to january 10			0
' health plans will continue to do everything they can to help consumers through the enrollment process and to mitigate potential confusion or disruption caused by all of these last minute changes to the rules and deadlines , ' said @entity111 , spokesman for @entity113 's @entity112 , an industry trade and lobbying group			0
@entity115 ( @entity116 ) and @entity117 were two of the millions who tried to sign up for the health care program before the first deadline of december 23 , but that was later pushed back to december 24 the @entity31 requires most @entity113 to be enrolled in coverage by march 31 or face penalties that start at $ 95			0
this week 's deadline , which had already been moved to december 23 from december 15 , applied to coverage starting on january 1			1
last week , the administration said people whose plans were canceled because they did not meet new standards of coverage under the law would qualify for a ' hardship ' exemption that allows some people to avoid a penalty for not signing up for health insurance			1
several state - run exchanges have also moved their enrollment deadlines			1
@entity138 and @entity139 , two of the largest , added a one - day grace period similar to the federal insurance marketplace			2
@entity143 said on tuesday it would allow sign - ups until december 31 given heavy volume and technical problems that have hampered its exchange			0
@entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 had already extended their deadlines beyond @entity43 .			0

the @entity73 administration gave users an extra day to sign up for the president 's signature health insurance after computer problems
coverage will begin on january 1
before monday 's rush , more than 1 million people had signed up for private coverage through @entity38 - which serves 36 states - and 14 state - run marketplaces , according to state and federal estimates
