committee chair @entity39 said : ‘ the department ( @entity18 ) has also failed to challenge properly those @entity3 tobacco manufacturers who turn a blind eye to the avoidance of @entity3 tax by supplying more of their products to @entity7 countries than the legitimate market in those countries could possibly require			1
‘ the tobacco then finds its way back into the @entity3 market without tax being paid			2
‘ the supply of some brands of hand - rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240 per cent			1
‘ @entity18 must be more assertive with these manufactures			0

but during the planning stage , @entity18 realised that @entity3 officials could not exercise their powers in another country in that way and the project was scrapped			2
the @entity8 also said @entity18 was failing to deter potential tobacco smugglers through its use of prosecution powers			0
it said : ' @entity18 has not made full use of the range of enforcement actions available to it in dealing with those involved in the illicit tobacco trade , or challenge adequately @entity3 tobacco manufacturers that fail to prevent the over-supply of their tobacco products to countries from which they might be smuggled back into the @entity3			1

tobacco fraud cost taxpayers £ 1.9 billion in 2010/11 , the @entity8 said , with nine per cent of cigarettes and 38 per cent of hand - rolling tobacco sold in the @entity3 estimated to be sold on the black market			2
but the group of mps said there were ‘ only ’ 265 prosecutions for tobacco smuggling in 2012/13 and prosecutions for organised crime fell from 62 to 51 in the last year			1
@entity18 does not know what level of enforcement action is needed to deter would - be offenders , the group of @entity110 added			0

‘ each year it constitutes a theft of revenue to the tune of some £ 1.9 billion , 20 per cent of the total sum collected through tax			0
‘ it undermines drives to cut smoking and is also linked to the activities of organised crime			0
’ the group of @entity110 recommended @entity18 and @entity146 should publicise prosecutions and other enforcement action more widely to deter potential offenders			0
the @entity8 said @entity18 had made some ground tackling tobacco smuggling , with estimates showing a drop for illicit tobacco products between 2000/01 and 2010/11			1
the expansion of @entity18 's network of overseas intelligence officers has been particularly successful , preventing £ 226 million of lost tax in the last two years for an initial investment of £ 4.6 million , it added			2
