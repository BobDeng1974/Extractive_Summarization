by @entity0 student organizations at @entity2 have started a movement against words they believe you just should n't say			1
the ' @entity9 ' campaign determines common slang phrases such as ' @entity11 ' , ' that 's so gay ' and ' @entity12 ' as offensive language that dehumanizes and marginalizes people and groups at the @entity17 college , specifically the lgbt community			1
but critics are n't convinced , saying that word discouragement is an attack on free speech and public policy			1
' language is a reflection of how we think about others and view the world , ' @entity24 , a student leader of the campaign , told @entity30			2
think before you speak : the ' @entity9 ' campaign at @entity2 confronts everyday expressions that center around gender and sexual orientation and has gained national publicity , especially from critics ' my goal is to help facilitate discussion about how language affects many social issues , from race to gender and sexuality			1
' the campaign is made up of a series of black and white posters , most of which appear only online , featuring students pledging why they will not say the street talk they have deemed offensive			2
among the banned words are ' homo ' , ' bitch ' , ' tranny ' and ' fag ' , mostly because all are oppressive terms			0
the campaign is a collaborative effort between a newly formed group at @entity2 called think before you talk and @entity64 , a @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 student advocacy group			1
the campaign has gained national publicity and plenty of supporters , but the detractors are equally as fervent			0
a new word - discouragement campaign at @entity2 has labeled phrases such as ' @entity77 ' , ' that ¿ s @entity66 ' , and ' @entity78 ' as offensive language that marginalizes homosexuality ' i ca n’t say anything about an individual person , because it might be construed as offensive to a larger group … even if i had no intention of offending a larger group , ' one @entity88 critic posted			1
others said it was unrealistic to try and put a stop on language that is so everyday			0
' as a thinking individual , i do n’t and did n’t need some children from @entity2 admonishing me for '' thinking any gender is inferior '' , ’ another @entity88 user said			0
' do you see what they did there ? ‘ ' any gender ''			0
not ‘ ' either gender ''			0
it ’s all about redefining terms , redefining life			0
' @entity107 professor dr. @entity106 said while there is a need for consideration when choosing one 's language , the ' @entity9 ' campaign has a narrow focus			2
' with anybody advocating the banning of a certain word or phrase … would they be willing to publicly say , ‘ ' i promise in return to never hinder a speech by a political figure with whose political philosophy i disagree ? ” @entity106 told @entity30			0
the project was developed by think before you talk and @entity64 , two student organizations at @entity2			1
