@entity0 insists @entity1 are still the team under pressure in the sixth one - day international in @entity3 despite their impressive win at the same venue to trail only 3 - 2 in the series			1
@entity8 's tourists narrowed the gap and kept themselves in with a chance after all of starting their @entity12 winter with a series success , if they can win the final two matches against @entity15			1
@entity0 , however , remains confident his team are capable of much better - as long as his spinners make the most of home conditions			1
@entity1 narrowed their deficit in the series to 3 - 2 after five @entity22 thanks to an impressive @entity24 century ' the pressure is still on @entity1 , ' he said , after fine performances from @entity27 with the ball and then centurion @entity24 and @entity30 with the bat had redressed the balance in a match spread over two days because of rain			1
' we just have to go and be aggressive and positive			0
' we 're very confident			0
we do n't need to panic			0
it 's just that we did n't play well			1
we know that and we know the mistakes we made			0
' one or two tweaks may be in the offing for @entity15 , who have delivered plenty already with their plethora of spinners			1
this time they would be in selection , although the tinkering will start in earnest back in @entity49 next week should they clinch the series on saturday			1
' there might be a few changes , ' said @entity0			1
' whoever comes in , we have to try to win the series			1
it was disappointing the way we played			0
but we ca n't take a step back			0
@entity27 picked up six wickets in the fifth match of the series which keeps @entity1 in contention ' we need to move forward , and try to learn from our mistakes			1
' @entity63 has hinted of late that he would like to move up to open the batting - and with @entity64 dropped from the squad after his run of moderate form , the veteran may have his opportunity			0
' the options are still open for the opening slot , ' added @entity0			2
' @entity63 is one option			0
' we 've given opportunities to @entity64			0
he 's fared pretty well , in a couple of games , but he could have done better			2
' we expect a lot from him			0
we have nine more games ( before the @entity12 ) to try and experiment with the opening slot			2
' @entity15 captain @entity0 insists the pressure is still on @entity1 , who must win the last two games @entity15 's selectors have updated the squad for the last two matches - leaving out @entity64 , middle - order batsman @entity85 and spinner @entity86			1
batsmen @entity87 and former captain @entity88 plus leg - spinner @entity89 have all been added - while uncapped chinaman bowler @entity91 and seamer @entity92 are also in the reckoning for a late entrance into the series			2
@entity0 said , however : ' we 're not looking to experiment too much ( yet )			1
@entity0 accepts his team were poor in the last game , but says he will not experiment until the series is won ' we 'll see how it goes in the next game , and then see if we can do that a bit in the last one			1
our objective is to win the series first , then do the experiments			2
' we still bank on our spinners - especially on that wicket , turning square			0
they did n't bowl that well			0
but i 'm pretty sure they 'll come back hard			0
' we need to get the combinations right			0
we ca n't play three off - spinners , just to give an opportunity to a certain player			2

@entity1 won fifth match of seven - game series to make score 3 - 2
@entity8 's side still need to win both remaining games to win series
@entity0 says @entity15 wo n't experiment with selection until series is won
the sixth match will take place on saturday
