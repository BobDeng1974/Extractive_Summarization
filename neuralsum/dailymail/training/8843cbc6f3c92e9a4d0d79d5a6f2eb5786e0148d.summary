@entity0 does not wish to be defined by the 2011 tragedy and has forged a career in the @entity7 @entity5 practises snapping at @entity29 , @entity6 ahead of an @entity7 game last year ‘ we were watching the weather			1
they said it was coming and my room - mate and i went outside and we looked for it , but it was behind us so we could n’t see it			0
my grandfather called and said we need to take shelter , so we took shelter in the property			0
about 30 seconds later it hit the house			2
’ in a closet alongside two of his room - mates , @entity5 cuddled and reassured @entity19 that everything would be ok			1
but winds of 190mph shredded the house , ripping it from its foundations			0
the twister threw him 50 feet , and while both his friends survived , when he woke in hospital the next morning , he discovered the devastating news			0
‘ you ’re not defined by what you go through			2
you ’re defined by how you respond			2
and that ’s how i want to be defined			2
‘ and the circumstance of the tornado , suffering loss and being injured , my vision was to play football and three years later , i ’m playing football in the @entity7			1
and i think it ’s really cool how far i ’ve come			0
‘ football has given me a really unique platform to be able to encourage people and inspire , challenge and motivate and not only in @entity75 , but now in @entity76 , ’ he said before the @entity6 ’ game against the @entity70 at @entity71 on sunday			1
@entity5 poses with a photo of @entity78 during a television interview , where he was asked if he knew who the former @entity82 international was			1
he did not ! @entity5 ( left ) prepares to snap on a second quarter punt against the @entity85 last season @entity5 suffered a broken wrist , severe concussion and an injury to his ankle which required a radical new technique from dr @entity93			1
‘ i got a skin graft from a cadaver			0
that ’s not my real skin on there , ’ @entity5 says , pointing to a not unsubstantial scar near his right ankle , ‘ that ’s somebody else ’s skin			1
it ’s a pretty new procedure			0
‘ he did the skin draft in the locker room after one of our college games			2
it was able to heal in the middle of the football season , under the most hostile conditions			2
they tried it on a few hundred people and mine was one of the only ones that worked			0
’ swept away by the love and support of his college and the community , the inspirational @entity5 helped to rebuild a town which had seen nearly 2,500 homes damaged by a deadly mile - wide trail of destruction			1

all proceeds go to his charity , the @entity148 , which helps those who have suffered loss or hardship			0
‘ i thought it was an opportunity to help people and to inspire people and my mantra has been some people ask for blessings , but i ask that i can be a blessing , and that ’s what i wanted to do with the book			0
‘ i definitely would n’t be where i am today if it was n’t for my family and my friends , my team - mates and the rehab staff at @entity168			0
that ’s another reason why i wanted to give back to them because they lifted me up when i needed it most			0
i ca n’t thank them enough			0
’ a deeply religious man , @entity5 draws strength from his faith and also from his parents , who have both survived cancer			1
‘ my mum when i was in third grade and my dad when i was in eighth grade			0
just growing up and having them as role models and being able to watch them face adversity and how they handled it			0
actions speak louder than words			0
’ which is clearly a mantra that @entity5 lives by			2
