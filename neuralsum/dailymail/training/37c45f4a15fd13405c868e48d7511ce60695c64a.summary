the queen anne staircase was sold off from @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 ( left ) when the house was demolished in 1954 - and now a @entity16 enthusiast has managed to trace it to a home in @entity8 ( right ) @entity16 enthusiast @entity31 , 68 , who tracked down the staircase in @entity8 , explained : ' there was @entity34 , aged six and @entity35 , who was about four or five			1
' the story goes that @entity34 was a bit of a handful and used to do all sorts of nasty things and @entity3 had trouble controlling him			2
' on one occasion , she tied the children to chairs			0
the family must have found out about this and they dismissed her the same year			0
she would have worked there for about nine months in all			0
' @entity31 , known as the ' @entity50 of @entity12 ' , said : ' the staircase was once part of @entity11 and i can remember going there as a very small child			1
@entity3 , the youngest of the sisters , worked as a governess at @entity11 ( pictured ) in 1839 , caring for five of the @entity25 family children			1
the building was demolished in 1954 and the staircase sold at auction ' but the mansion was demolished and today it 's a housing estate			1
bits of it were sold to dealers and the staircase went to one in @entity66 , @entity67			2
@entity3 , the youngest of the sisters , worked as a governess at @entity11 in 1839 ' it was sold at auction to a @entity73 and @entity72 , who had just built themselves a new house on @entity8 and were in @entity67 looking for things to fill it with			1
' they took the staircase and installed it in their house and there it stayed			0
' opera singer @entity82 and her husband bought the staircase in 1958 for their new home in @entity86 , @entity8			0
but six decades down the line no one knew if it was still in the house			0
through tireless research , and the help of the @entity93 , @entity31 managed to track the stairs down			2
in a strange twist to the tale , it was claimed mrs @entity82 had seen the ghost of a woman on the stairs in 1962 , believed to be @entity3			1
the figure , her hair in a bun , was dressed in a long full skirt with a tri-cornered shawl			0
mrs @entity82 was convincecd @entity35 's ghost had been exported 3,000 miles away with the staircase			1
indeed , the discovery , which was aided by museum staff in @entity9 , came as a complete surprise to the current owners of the building			2
fellow @entity16 enhusiast @entity113 said : ' the staircase represents a slightly more unusual connection between @entity12 and @entity3			1
' some will know she worked as a governess at @entity11 for nine months in 1839 and she depicts her experiences there in the first half of @entity119 , renaming the hall ' @entity122 ' and the @entity25 family the ' bloomfields			1
' she wrote two novels , @entity119 and @entity126 ( left )			0
she died of tuberculosis on 28 may 1849 and was buried in @entity128 , @entity129 ( right ) ' that house was demolished in 1954 and , although the interior parts were dismantled and auctioned off , their fates were lost in the mists of time			0
due to a short article in the @entity140 back in the 1960s , the wonderful @entity137 staircase , hand - carved in burled yew , went to a @entity67 dealer			2
' he then sold it to @entity145 and @entity82 , an @entity147 couple he met at @entity148 in 1958 and they installed it in their house on @entity8 , @entity9			2
' the story goes that mrs @entity82 saw a ghost on the stairs in 1962			2
was it @entity35 ? who knows ? the @entity156 ( pictured l to r @entity35 , @entity158 and @entity159 ) were part of a literary family , who lived in @entity162 in @entity13 in the 19th century ' having checked this much out , our ' @entity50 of @entity12 ' made inquiries abroad but things did not look promising			1
people seemed to think that the house had been lost in one of the many hurricanes that occur so commonly there			0
' the breakthrough came when a keen local librarian suggested contacting the @entity93 and they tracked down the exact location of the house and contacted the current owner			0
' much to their joy they discovered that not only was the staircase intact but the current owner was unaware of its origins and delighted to invite them over to see it			0
' now @entity12 and @entity182 are working together to document this little - known link between them with a view to incorporating it in the bicentenary celebrations			2
' the quirky find has come at an important time as preparations are being made to mark the bicentennial of the birth of @entity193 in 1816			0
a number of events are planned both here and in the @entity147 to mark the occasion and now the staircase has been found , it is hoped it will become a part of it			0
@entity3 bicentenaries are going to be celebrated from 2016 to 2020 starting with @entity193 's birthday on april 21 , 1816 followed by @entity158 's on july 30 , 1818 and @entity35 's on january 17 , 1820			1
