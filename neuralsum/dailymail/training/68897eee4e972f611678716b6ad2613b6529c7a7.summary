six summers ago @entity0 was without a club and told by his wife @entity3 to make a career from football within one season or abandon the sport for a steady 9 - 5 job instead			1
shifts spray - painting cars or working on building sites beckoned before @entity11 offered @entity0 a chance at @entity13 in the @entity14			1
they won the title together , @entity0 was named player of the season , and then both moved to @entity20 – where the central defender is now one win away from the @entity23			1
video : scroll down to see @entity26 's view on the @entity28 showdown with @entity29 from rags to riches : former conference player @entity0 ( right ) is 90 minutes away from the @entity23 committed to the cause : @entity0 believes @entity20 's youth gives them the edge over @entity29 it has been quite a climb up the @entity37 ladder but such is @entity0 ’s standing in the squad he will deliver the pre-match rallying call when the players assemble in a huddle on the @entity28 pitch , drawing on his own experiences to find the right emotive trigger for team - mates			1
@entity0 , who was released by @entity47 in 2008 after relegation , said : ‘ i took it to heart			2
' that summer , you wait for the phone to ring , then it ’s the end of june , players were starting pre-season and i did n’t have a club			2
‘ i had mortgages and bills to play like every normal person			0
the only call came from @entity11			2
it was either get a job , or take the opportunity of playing at @entity13 part - time			1
‘ my missus gave me an ultimatum of one season or i had to get a trade			0
' i was spray painting cars for an insurance company , i did a bit of building work , labouring			1
heartbreak : @entity0 was part of the @entity76 side that were relegated out of the @entity37 ‘ @entity77 were training at the @entity79 centre which was just being built			1
i was very lucky that season was the final piece of the jigsaw that got us out of the @entity14			0
’ @entity0 admits he was ‘ hurt ’ when @entity11 was sacked last september but says @entity26 has improved the team			1
‘ @entity11 ’s been in touch and wished the lads all the best , ’ adds @entity0			1
@entity28 will be a new experience for @entity26 ’s young team , who give away plenty of top - flight experience to @entity92 ’s high - earning side			2
@entity20 ’s wages top out at £ 12,000 per week while the likes of @entity95 and @entity96 have £ 60,000 per week deals at @entity29			0
lifeline : @entity11 took @entity0 to @entity77 and then to @entity99 @entity0 ’s career has been a world away from such mega contracts and even though riches will follow in the @entity23 his pre-match address will steer away from money as a motivation			1
‘ the huddles have all been quite emotional , i ’ve tried to hit home , talk about things which might mean a lot to the players , ’ he says			0
‘ we talk about your family , your kids or maybe the haters - people who ’ve doubted you over the course of your career			2
‘ the drive is to play in the @entity23 , to play at @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124			0
it ’s not about money and never has been			0
it ’s about playing in the highest league as a player			0
’ the 29 - year - old , who became a father in the last year to 11 - month - old @entity131 , believes @entity20 ’s youth can prove decisive			2
‘ @entity29 have the name players and they ’ve all played in the division above			0
we ’ve got a lot of young players with energy			0
if they want to stand toe to toe with us and we perform as we have done over 48 games then there ’ll only be one outcome			0

defender admits he was 12 months from *walking* away from the game
@entity0 spent time working on building sites and spray painting cars
