by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 stormed into the race lead of the @entity4 as @entity5 collected his second consecutive stage victory in another breakaway			1
@entity8 - born @entity1 began stage six one minute 25 seconds behind @entity11 's @entity10 in the general classification but got himself in the break along with @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16 of @entity17 , and together they entirely changed the shape of the @entity4			1
capitalising on the time trialling skills of both @entity14 and @entity1 , they built a lead of more than nine minutes on the road , and the peloton rarely looked capable of bringing it back despite some frantic efforts from @entity11 in the closing stages of the challenging 205.6km run from @entity29 to @entity30			1
@entity5 celebrates winning stage six of the 2014 @entity4 as @entity1 of @entity32 watches the tv to check if he has taken the race lead after stage six @entity32 's @entity1 celebrates being the new race leader after stage six of the @entity4 all the racers gather towards the end of stage six of the 2014 @entity4 @entity1 showed no interest in contesting @entity14 for the stage victory on the final straight , knowing his job was done as he took a 34 second lead in the overall standings			1
it was just reward for a rider who put a huge effort into a breakaway on stage four , only to have all his hard work undone by a double puncture			1
' it was the hardest day of my life , ' @entity1 said on @entity55			2
' i just thought they were letting us out to bring us back and i was a bit hacked off with myself because i thought i could have a good time trial but i was leaving a lot out on the road and i might have given too much			0
' once the gap went up to seven minutes i thought , that 's quite big , then it was eight , nine , and i really started digging in			2
' i spoke to @entity5 and we made an agreement he would go for the stage because i knew there was a good chance i would take yellow and it was a risk i was willing to take			2
' he gave me everything			0
i could n't have done it without him and @entity16 too from @entity17			0
he probably had the hardest day of his life , he gave all he could and i 'm grateful to him			0
' the break 's lead reached 9mins 15secs with a little over 87km to go before the peloton stepped up the chase			0
@entity11 and @entity76 were prominent on the front , but they had left themselves too much to do			0
the gap dipped under five minutes with 33km to go , but it was not coming down quickly enough and there was a lull in the chase as teams began to look at each other			0
as they moved inside the final 10km it was @entity10 on the front , desperate to keep his yellow jersey , but it would prove to be in vain			0
the @entity91 makes its way through the @entity93 in @entity29 at the start of stage six of 2014 @entity4 @entity96 of @entity32 passes through @entity97 on @entity98 during stage six of 2014 @entity4 @entity99 rides in the peloton during stage six of the @entity4 from @entity29 to @entity30 sir @entity101 looks to keep himself in the mix until the final trial on sunday @entity1 now leads @entity10 by 34 seconds , with the @entity105 @entity104 ( @entity106 ) 40 seconds behind in third and @entity108 's @entity107 50 seconds back in fourth			1
defending champion sir @entity101 had been focused on keeping himself there or thereabouts until the final time trial on sunday , but while @entity76 took the odd turn on the front , they were barely seen towards the end of the day and @entity1 's move leaves @entity118 with much work to do on saturday 's 226.5km run from @entity121 to @entity122 , sitting 62 seconds down in seventh place .			1
