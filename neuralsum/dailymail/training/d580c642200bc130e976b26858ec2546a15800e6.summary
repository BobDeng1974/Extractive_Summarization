by @entity0 these shocking pictures show frightened monkeys being held down , tattooed without anaesthetic , injected and examined as they await a flight to the @entity5 to be used in scientific research			1
the images were taken at a factory breeding farm in @entity9 , from where hundreds of monkeys are flown to @entity5 laboratories on @entity13 flights			1
they were released by the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , an animal rights organisation that recently concluded a probe into one of several @entity9 farms breeding long - tailed macaques for experiments			1
the pictures were taken on a farm that provides animals for experiments in @entity5 labs investigators say they saw horrific scenes of distressed babies being tattooed without anaesthetic , monkeys restrained and injected in view of other animals , wild animals captured to re-stock breeding colonies , barren crowded cages and animals killed or injured from fighting			1
they also claim to have witnessed the stressful separation of mothers and their babies and rough handling , including monkeys wrenched from cages by their tails and netted animals slammed onto concrete floors			2
more than 1,500 monkeys were imported into the @entity5 for experiments in 2012 - an increase of 50 per cent - and nearly 1,000 of those were from @entity9			1
warning graphic content campaigners say mothers and their babies are separated - an incredibly stressful process for both harrowing : a baby monkey is tattooed for identification purposes just a few days ago the @entity66 admitted to @entity15 that it no longer checks and approves overseas breeding facilities , instead leaving it up to laboratories , according to the charity			1
in the @entity5 , monkeys are used mainly to test drugs or for neurological research			2
animals typically endure force - feeding or injections of experimental compounds , have electrodes implanted into their brains and are immobilised in restraint chairs while they are experimented on			0
@entity15 said it has found monkeys that have suffered from rectal prolapse from the stress of being restrained , blackened lungs , trembling , collapse , bleeding and self - mutilation - including one animal who chewed its finger to the bone			0
most monkeys are killed at the end of the experiment , but others are forced to endure years in barren laboratory cages			0
the @entity15 has called for a ban on all animals for research @entity15 chief executive @entity100 said : ' just as the use of great apes was abandoned decades ago , it is time to end the use of all primates in research			0
' the pain , suffering and clear distress caused to these intelligent , emotional animals is inexcusable when there are advanced alternatives already available			0
' such crude and outdated animal research methods can be replaced with quicker , cheaper and scientifically superior methods â€“ the cutting edge of modern science			0
' a sedated male is pinned as blood is taken from his thigh a monkey with a limb missing			0
staff told investigators that the missing limbs were birth deformities			0
right , a mother with arms and tail pinned behind her back as her baby clings to her a statement from @entity132 said : ' @entity13 is fully aware of the opposition from animal rights associations concerning the use of animals and more particularly primates for medical research			1
' @entity13 would however like to state that the animals it transports are not ill - treated in any way on board its flights and are provided with the utmost care and attention			1
' @entity13 also strictly complies with the @entity146 concerning protected animal and plant species , whose transport must systematically be for identified scientific reasons and which is regulated on an international scale			2
' @entity153 ensures that all biomedical research involving the use of animals in laboratories with which the airline works is fully in line with current legislation and the regulations drawn up by scientific organisations specialising in animal welfare ' @entity153 also monitors the supplier , who must comply with the breeding rules in force			0
' @entity13 claims it has stringent policies in place to prevent the animals it transports from suffering			2

monkeys are *locked* in tiny boxes and transported on @entity13 flights
animals *snatched* from wild and *imprisoned* in @entity9 factory farms
they provide animals for laboratories in the @entity5 , @entity190 and @entity191
