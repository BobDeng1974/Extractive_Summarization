with more than two months to go until @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 still weeks away , most people wo n't have even thought festive decorations			1
but for one hotel in @entity7 it seems it is never too early to enter into the @entity1 spirit			2
the @entity10 in @entity11 has already erected an artificial tree in the bay window at the front of the building - 75 days before christmas day			1
the front of the @entity10 in @entity11 where a christmas tree has already appeared in a bay window , circled the appearance of the tree comes despite it being two months until @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 still weeks away it is also despite the fact it is three weeks until @entity2 and a month until @entity3			1
it was spotted by people passing by the three - star hotel in the spa town with one saying he was ' staggered by what he saw '			1
businessman @entity28 told the @entity29 : ' it looks completely ridiculous			0
' whoever decided to put up the tree should hang their head in shame			0
' however , one of the hotel managers told @entity36 that the only reason for the @entity1 display was to promote their festive party nights			2
he added that it was placed inside one of the hotel 's function rooms and they were n't aware of any negative feedback about the tree			1
the 12 foot christmas tree in the @entity49 restaurant in @entity50 , @entity51 , which had to be taken down after customers complained it comes after a pub in @entity51 that put up a christmas tree back in august were forced to take it down after customers complained			1
excited manager @entity57 got into the festive spirit by putting up the 12 foot tree at the @entity61 restaurant in @entity50 - despite temperatures outside at the time reaching @entity63			0
but mr @entity57 , who erected the tree to coincide with a @entity1 promotion , said he had took down the tree because the plan ' backfired '			2
the manager said it had all been a ' bit of banter ' to promote the fact the restaurant had started taking bookings , but that several customers had made negative comments			0
the tree baffled diners , who said they were shocked to enter the pub and be greeted by the festive decoration			0
@entity57 , the manager of the @entity49 , pictured , said putting up the tree was just a ' bit of banter ' to promote @entity1 a @entity85 spokesman said at the time : ' we do have our @entity1 menus available now , as some of our guests like to book up early			0
' however it looks like our manager has got into the @entity1 spirit a little too soon - we normally do nâ€™t put our @entity1 decorations up until the @entity95			1
' meanwhile @entity97 retailer @entity96 also got their countdown to the festive period under way in august by putting @entity1 cards on the shelves			0
but the cards were not the only festive - themed wares , with winter wonderland wrapping paper and tree decorations , some featuring @entity108 also up for sale .			0
