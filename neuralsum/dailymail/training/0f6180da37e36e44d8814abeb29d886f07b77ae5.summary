by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 once declared he wanted to ' let sunshine win the day ’			2
the prime minister today certainly appeared to have spent more time soaking up the rays than his chancellor @entity6 , who looked rather pale next to his tanned boss			1
they arrived on a building site at the @entity10 19 in @entity11 wearing an array of safety gear and equipment which may bring to mind more a nuclear fallout than a construction area , with a bronzed mr @entity2 still glowing from a week in the @entity18 sun. the two senior conservatives had earlier made a rare joint appearance in @entity21 to announce a raft of new building schemes			1
safety first : chancellor @entity6 ( second left ) and prime minister @entity2 ( third right ) on a visit to the @entity28 site office to view the @entity29 in @entity11 looking around : chancellor @entity6 ( left ) and prime minister @entity2 ( centre ) are shown the @entity29 by @entity28 construction manager @entity31 ( right ) the two men have avoided appearing in public together since the coalition was formed , to avoid the much - mocked impression that they are two ‘ arrogant posh boys ’ running the country together			1
however , the dramatic return to economic growth and tumbling unemployment numbers has given the conservative duo confidence to share a platform in front of the cameras			1
in government they have only been seen side - by - side when mr @entity6 has delivered @entity48 statements in the @entity49 , or at events involving other ministers			1
today they claimed more than 150,000 jobs could be created by £ 36 billion of infrastructure projects being started in the @entity55 this year			2
@entity2 looked bronzed at an event today compared to his chancellor @entity6 the two men have not appeared together as a double - act since the general election , but took part in a question and answer session at the construction company @entity28 in @entity64 the two men appeared at the construction company @entity28 in @entity64 , @entity65			2
they claimed that more than 200 rail , road , local transport , broadband , airport and waste management projects are due to start construction over the next year			2
flood defences are also on the list after a winter of devastating weather left several areas under water			0
however , @entity79 dismissed the announcement , claiming it amounted to just 10 per cent of the £ 375 billion of infrastructure investment announced in december			0
mr @entity2 and mr @entity6 announced £ 36billion worth of major building projects which will start this year the dramatic return to economic growth and tumbling unemployment numbers has given the conservative duo confidence to share a platform in front of the cameras mr @entity2 jetted off to @entity18 last week with his family , where he was seen relaxing in shorts and taking a dip in the sea			1
but in a moment of drama , the prime minister was stung by a jellyfish as he swum on the @entity103 island 's popular @entity101 beach			2
tourists told how he came running out of the water in his blue swimming trunks rubbing his arm			0
mr @entity2 stayed with his wife @entity108 and their three children at a £ 200 - a - night yoga retreat at the resort			1
they returned to the @entity55 at the weekend			0
the prime minister has ordered a major push on projects to get @entity55 building			1
‘ ensuring @entity55 has first class infrastructure is a crucial part of our long - term economic plan : supporting business , creating jobs and providing a better future for hardworking people , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ as a crucial part of our long - term economic plan , this government is backing business with better infrastructure so that more jobs and opportunities are created for hardworking people , meaning more financial security and peace of mind for families			0
’ mr @entity2 spent last week sunning himself on the @entity103 island of @entity18 , where he was stung by a jellyfish while swimming mr @entity6 added : ‘ because of the tough decisions we have taken in day - to - day spending , we can prioritise public investment where it is most needed and create the right conditions for private investment in infrastructure where it brings value for the taxpayer			1
‘ so this year over 200 new projects worth an estimated £ 36 billion are due to start , creating thousands of jobs , securing future growth and delivering the world class infrastructure @entity55 deserves			2
’ the £ 36 billion estimate is made up of £ 5 billion in public investment , £ 21 billion private and £ 10 billion in joint funding			0
but @entity79 ’s shadow treasury minister @entity155 said : ‘ we need action not words on infrastructure if we 're to get a recovery built to last			0
‘ under @entity2 and @entity6 , despite multiple infrastructure plans and reheated announcements like today 's , infrastructure output in the economy is down more than 10 %			0
‘ the government 's overall infrastructure pipeline in december showed fewer than a quarter of projects ' in construction '			0
‘ we are seeing the lowest peacetime level of house - building since the 1920s and more cuts are planned to capital spending next year			0
‘ investors need certainty and delivery , not just another load of warm words			0
