by @entity0 published : 13:25 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:55 est , 7 december 2012 a ' heartbroken ' family have just 24 hours to to flee their home over fears it is about to disappear into a 30ft crater			1
mother of three @entity8 faces losing her home to a massive 30ft deep dene hole that has appeared in the front garden of their home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the crater , which is the remains of a cave dug out by @entity19 hiding from invading @entity20 in the @entity21 , first appeared as a small hole on tuesday			2
the dene hole in @entity8 's garden first appeared on tuesday morning however it has since grown 35ft wide and 30ft deep , disrupting the @entity27 ' gas and electricity			1
a spring has also appeared in the hole , with the water it is leaking causing the crater to widen even faster			2
despite round the clock efforts by the council and engineers to help the family they have said that nothing can be done until it stops widening			1
mrs @entity8 , 44 , has lived in the house with her husband and three children since buying it nine years ago			1
the family had a full survey done when they bought the house , but it failed to reveal any potential problems			2
and now they have been forced to take down their @entity49 decorations just days after putting them up and have been given 24 hours to move their valuables from the stricken house			1
it has since swollen to a massive 30ft deep crater and forced the @entity27 to move home @entity59 holes are underground structures formed of a number of small chalk caves accessed by a vertical shaft			1
hey date back to the @entity21 and are largely found in chalky ground in @entity66 and @entity15 along the lower banks of the @entity69 holes are believed to have been dug by @entity70 fearful of an impending @entity20 invasion , hence their @entity72 say the chambers , which can be up to 60ft ( 20m ) deep were also used to store grain and extract chalk			1
describing the appearance of the crater , mrs @entity8 said : ' it was first thing in the morning i noticed a little hole , but over the day it got bigger and bigger			1
' at the minute its about 30ft wide and 35ft deep			0
because of this we have also had a spring appear so we have fresh water coming in and making the hole worse			2
' it 's probably about 7ft away from my house now and it will be closer in the morning - it just drops and drops			2
she added : ' we 've been told we have 24 hours to pack up our belongings and get out of the house			0
' i 've never , ever heard of a dene hole before otherwise i would n't have moved into this area			1
' i feel absolutely heart - broken			0
i love my home and it 's @entity49 time as well			1
i have just put the @entity49 decorations up and now i have had to take them down			1
' we are staying in a hotel tonight and trying to look for some accommodation at the minute but it 's hard to find somewhere to move straight away			1
' mrs @entity8 had a full survey done when she bought the house - but it failed to uncover the danger the collapse at the @entity105 home comes after a front garden disappeared in nearby @entity107 in october			1
emergency engineers were called to the @entity110 - side crater , with the @entity111 confirming that there had been at least one gas leak			2
@entity114 said they were taking ' all necessary precautionary measures ' regarding the dene hole , which has been fenced off			1
another dene hole appeared in nearby @entity118 , @entity14 in october ancient maps show the affected housing estate was built on more than 60 deep holes , most of which are 30ft below ground			1
but there is no information on why the council allowed homes to be built on such a vulnerable location in the first place			0
and infrastructure experts warned there was little that could be done to prevent future collapses			0
@entity111 spokesman @entity135 said : ' we take problems like this incredibly seriously			0
' ' it ’s not just us who will be affected by this			0
' electrics will be affected			0
' it would be very difficult to put anything preventative in place if the holes have been around for hundreds of years			0
' @entity148 , from @entity15 and @entity149 , echoed his views , saying : ' there ’s very little we can do because you do n’t know when or where it ’s going to happen			1
' despite the best efforts of engineers nothing can be done until the holes stop widening leading geologist @entity160 , 72 , from @entity161 , @entity162 , is a former president of the @entity164 , based in the en @entity165 , in @entity166 , @entity167			1
he claims @entity169 ’s deneholes have been mapped out by the club , which has researched and recorded the county ’s biology and geology since 1860			0
mr @entity160 said : ' teams of geologists have mapped out deneholes in that area , especially @entity14 , but a few may have slipped under the radar when studies were undertaken 50 years ago			0
' one or two may have escaped our attention and we would love to found out more			0
' i find it peculiar that the latest holes have been in people ’s front gardens because they can be found anywhere , even under someone ’s home			2
' those reporting a denehole should contact their local authority			0
they would be interested for both historical and safety reasons			0
' the dene holes can disrupt gas , electricity and water , and force families out of their homes dr @entity203 , researcher of at @entity204 , called for improved mapping of deneholes as a ‘ high priority ’			2
he said : ' @entity208 are artificial caves and can be dangerous if they collapse and need to be made safe			0
' they are poorly understood and there are many good reasons to investigate them but we need more archaeologists to be interested in them or engineers to carry out surveys if they are building homes and roads			2
' mapping them is important for an engineering and safety point of view and should be a high priority			0
' engineers should be working with local authorities to develop a better understand of the distribution of deneholes and to access the risk to infrastructure and housing			0
' @entity114 said it was taking ' all necessary precautionary measures			0

ancient first century dene hole *threatens* to *swallow* the @entity8 family 's @entity15 home
the family have had to take down their @entity49 decorations and move into a hotel
engineers say nothing can be done until the hole stops widening itself
