by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity3 's job as @entity4 is under threat after just 85 members of his @entity8 caucus voted for a fiscal cliff deal that 151 opposed and nearly all @entity10 backed			1
to add to his woes , @entity3 - who faces re-election as speaker on thursday - has been lambasted by @entity15 's governor @entity14 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , for failing to bring to a vote a $ 60billion relief bill for those affected by @entity19			1
governor @entity14 denounced the ' disappointing and disgusting ' spectacle of fiscal cliff manoeuvrings that showed a ' callous indifference ' for the people of @entity15			1
@entity14 said today : ' i called the speaker four times last night after 11.20pm and he did not take my calls			1
perhaps most ominously for @entity3 , his own leadership team publicly split from him over the vote with @entity41 majority leader @entity51 and majority whip @entity52 opposing the bill			2
in another indication of a bitterly divided party , the bill pitted another two top @entity8 prospects for the 2016 @entity41 race against each other			2
senator @entity60 of @entity61 voted no and representative @entity62 , the 2012 vice-presidential nominee , voted yes			2
according to @entity8 sources , @entity51 and @entity52 voted against the bill even though they had earlier pressurized rank - and - file members to support it , while @entity62 - another so - called @entity8 ' @entity67 - was expected to join them but changed his mind at the last minute			2
tough talk : @entity62 voted for the fiscal cliff deal because it was in the interest of the @entity74 people @entity62 later said in a statement : ' will the @entity74 people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative ? ' in the final analysis , the answer is undoubtedly yes			1
i came to @entity81 to make tough decisions - not to run away from them			2
' the influential conservative commentator @entity84 said on @entity85 that it was ' possible ' that @entity51 's opposition to the bill ' is the prelude to a challenge thursday ' , when the new @entity81 elected last november convenes			0
@entity84 said : ' it would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote			0
look , there are a lot of conservatives in the @entity8 caucus in the @entity41 who hate the bill and for good reason			0
' this is a complete surrender on everything			0
the ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1 , rather than one to one or one to two or one to three			0
so , i mean it 's a complete rout by the @entity10			0
' @entity109 , @entity110 , the former house speaker and 2012 presidential candidate , stated that @entity8 had been engaged in ' a two month dance of defeat and surrender '			0
disaster : boats are seen in a yard , where they washed onto shore during @entity19 , near @entity121 , @entity15 after the storm lashed the @entity123 long road to recovery : @entity126 , left , embraces his wife @entity127 as they survey the remains of the home owned by her parents in @entity132 , @entity133 during @entity19			1
there has been a delay on $ 60bn relief for those affected @entity138 chipped in , also via @entity109 : ' i am a @entity8 ... but the @entity8 may be the worst negotiators in history ! ' multiple accounts of the fiscal cliff negotiations revealed that @entity3 appeared to lose his composure on a number of occasions , most notably when he told senate majority leader @entity141 , the top @entity142 on @entity143 , to ' go f * * * yourself ' during a @entity41 meeting			1
@entity14 's broadside against @entity3 was also notable because he singled out @entity51 as having done his best to bring the @entity19 bill to a vote			1
but @entity51 's apparent attempts to get the fiscal cliff bill passed make him an unlikely rallying figure against @entity3 , at least in the short term			1
@entity159 , a leading conservative figure , used his @entity162 blog to dismiss the votes of @entity51 and @entity52 , saying : ' his was opportunism , not courage			0
' @entity166 , spokesman for of @entity167 , a conservative political action committee , told @entity168 that ' at least 20 @entity41 @entity8 members have gotten together , discussed this and want to unseat speaker @entity3 '			0
but he added that ' the one problem these guys face is they need a leader to coalesce behind ' .			0
