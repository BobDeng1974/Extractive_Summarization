@entity1 ’s reign as @entity3 manager started perfectly with a 3 - 1 win at fellow @entity6 promotion candidates @entity7			1
the @entity9 ’s appointment as successor to @entity11 raised a few eyebrows but this victory and the performance that delivered it will encourage all at the @entity16			0
on the evidence of this impressive win at @entity19 , delivered thanks to goals from @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , they can definitely mount an assault on the automatic promotion places			1
@entity1 applauds his new players during his first game in @entity30 management @entity22 gave the former @entity31 forward a great start , heading home from a corner to make it 1 - 0 @entity36 turns the ball in , but his effort was rightly ruled out for offside , as @entity7 tried to fight back @entity7 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 81 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 46 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 46 ) , @entity52 , @entity36 ( c ) subs not used : @entity54			1
scorer : @entity36 penalty 65 booked : @entity49 @entity57 : @entity58 ; @entity22 , @entity59 ( c ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity23 , @entity63 ( @entity64 68 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 90 +5 ) , @entity68 ( @entity24 65 ) subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 scorers : @entity22 37 ; @entity75 48 ; @entity76 68 booked : @entity22 , @entity62 , @entity59 referee : @entity78 attendance : 3,981 with just a few days to find his feet at the @entity84 club and get to know his squad , this was as good a performance as @entity1 could have wished for and a foundation stone upon which to build			1
it was not the most auspicious of starts			0
the @entity57 team coach was stuck in traffic on its journey down to @entity19 and arrived a little later than scheduled , though @entity1 , looking dapper in dark suit and club tie , was still all smiles for the waiting @entity98 cameras upon arrival			1
it seemed the @entity3 ’ socks had gone missing , or somehow clashed , and so they stepped out in a mismatched ensemble of yellow shirts , black shorts and light blue socks borrowed from their hosts			0
and to complete @entity1 ’s initiation into @entity6 football , his team booted the ball straight out from the kick - off			2
the small knot of 87 travelling fans from @entity57 gave the new manager their full and vocal backing from the outset , singing his name in repetition to a booming drum beat for the first 10 minutes			0
@entity1 has inherited a strong team from @entity11 , who jumped ship to @entity124 late last month , and @entity57 sat fifth in the standings after the weekend ’s action			1
@entity127 holds off @entity43 as @entity1 's side moved up to fourth in the @entity6 table @entity130 makes a good save to preserve @entity57 's lead on monday night at @entity19 @entity1 emerges from the tunnel at @entity19 to begin life as manager of @entity136 @entity7 , meanwhile , have enjoyed a real renaissance after last season ’s relegation dogfight and @entity141 ’s men had the opportunity to leapfrog @entity143 and @entity144 and return to the summit with three points			1
unsurprisingly it was they who set the tempo in the opening stages and captain @entity36 directed a @entity52 cross from the right narrowly wide with his knee			0
as @entity7 continued to press , @entity1 moved from his seat on the bench to stand , cross-armed , in his technical area , occasionally pointing a finger and bellowing an instruction			1
the @entity159 continued to push forward - @entity43 took a nice touch but could only fire over before @entity162 ’s cross was flicked on initially by the impressive @entity52 and then wide by @entity36			2
so it was firmly against the run of play that @entity57 took the lead on 38 minutes			2
if @entity1 goes on to achieve at @entity57 this will be remembered as the first goal of his epoch and a decent one it was too			1
@entity65 swung in a corner and there was @entity22 arriving right on cue to thump home a header			2
@entity1 responded coolly with a brief round of applause			0
the fans were again singing his name as the whistle went for half - time and he responded with an appreciative wave			2
@entity36 pulled one back for @entity7 from the penalty spot , but @entity57 responded quickly the new @entity57 manager signs a shirt outside the ground for a fan with an old @entity187 jersey it got even better shortly after the break with a second goal out of the @entity9 football school			1
@entity65 split the @entity7 defence with a diagonal through ball and @entity23 slotted the ball through the keeper ’s legs			2
things were all going a bit too well and @entity7 halved the deficit on 65 minutes when @entity52 was fouled inside the box			0
@entity36 smashed home the penalty and the momentum looked as though it was about to shift , especially when @entity52 headed over when well placed			2
three minutes later , @entity61 swung in a ball from the left and @entity24 , only just introduced from the bench , rose highest to head home and restore @entity57 ’s two - goal cushion			1
@entity36 saw a goal disallowed for offside before @entity24 almost added his second from a @entity65 cross but goalkeeper @entity40 scooped the ball away			1
there was plenty of excitement around the former @entity220 star trying his hand in the lower leagues a lengthy injury stoppage , which saw @entity7 ’s @entity43 hobble off , led to 11 minutes of stoppage time but @entity57 were n’t unduly troubled again and @entity1 celebrated with a beaming smile and a wave to his family in the stands			1
speaking on @entity98 , @entity1 said : ' it was a really good group performance			0
we were solid in a lot of aspects of the game , at times we passed it well			0
' i will try to get as much knowledge as possible [ about @entity6 ] and see as many games as possible , get to know the players			0
i knew a fair bit but it 's always good to get to know more			0
there will be many night when i 'll be in the stands watching			0
' we 'll take the confidence from this and we have another difficult one next week - @entity143 at home			0
it 's a different game , a battle and the boys will be up for it			0

@entity22 puts @entity57 ahead with a header from a corner
@entity23 makes it 2 - 0 shortly after half time with tidy finish
@entity36 pulls one back from the penalty spot for @entity7
