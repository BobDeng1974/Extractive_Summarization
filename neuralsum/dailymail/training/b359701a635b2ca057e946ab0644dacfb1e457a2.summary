by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s signing of @entity4 was confirmed during sunday ’s @entity6 final			1
his £ 12m arrival from @entity9 slipped under the radar somewhat given the timing			1
but worry not , @entity12 is here to tell you everything you need to know about the highly - rated newcomer to the @entity16 … new boy : @entity4 poses with his @entity3 shirt inside @entity19 after sealing his £ 12million move in a nutshell , who is he ? in short , he ’s a 24 - year - old @entity23 international who plays as an attacking midfielder			1
he came through the ranks at @entity9 and left having scored 28 times from 115 outings			1
@entity28 international ? sounds like a bit of coup for the @entity32 ? it certainly is and it ’s surprising there was n’t more of a scramble for his signature			1
he was included in the @entity28 @entity6 squad as a late replacement for the injured @entity42 and we suspect @entity3 were praying he did n’t get on , for he might just have alerted others to his talents			1
thankfully for @entity46 – who had been tracking the schemer for some time - @entity4 remained on the bench in @entity49 and @entity28 eventually exited at the quarter - final stage against @entity51			1
big stage : @entity4 ( right ) was part of @entity28 's @entity6 squad but failed to make an appearance for @entity28 so he is n’t established in the @entity28 squad yet ? he made his debut in a @entity6 warm - up fixture against @entity59 as a second - half replacement for former @entity3 midfielder @entity61 – who persuaded him to move to @entity19 - but he missed out on the initial squad for @entity49			1
he still just has the one cap to his name but time is on his side and he will be more involved when @entity28 begin preparations for the @entity69 in september			2
do n’t forget , 26 - year - old @entity70 was n’t an established @entity71 international until earlier this year and he ’s just joined @entity73 for £ 25m			2
you mention @entity70 , is he similar in style ? well , they ’re about the same size ( @entity4 is 5ft7in , @entity70 5ft 8in ) , both boast no shortage of skill and operate in the same areas			2
only one cost more than twice as much as the other			0
fresh start : @entity4 ( left ) , pictured in action against @entity86 last season , is @entity3 's fourth summer signing but i hear he models his game on @entity92 ? true , his idol is the @entity94 and @entity95 forward			1
he even styles his hair in a similar fashion			0
and @entity4 himself told @entity99 : ' i loved to learn how to dribble like him and do the tricks , but now i am on the professional stage , i have my own way			2
' i am looking to improve all the time and @entity3 is a well - known , very good club			2
i just love to improve and that 's what i 'm here to do			0
' the @entity3 will be hoping the comparisons with @entity92 extend beyond his haircut			2
break : @entity4 will go on holiday to @entity110 before returning to pre-season training with his new club @entity3 splash out on @entity4 so what is his game all about ? like a younger ronaldo , @entity4 has , at times , been criticised for too many step - overs , flicks and tricks			1
last season , however , he honed his abilities and the upshot was a 14 - goal return in @entity124 , no mean feat for a midfielder			0
he can create as well as score and there have been comparisons drawn with former @entity131 favourite @entity130			0
he has a turn of foot to compliment his craft and was @entity9 ’s star player last season			0
excited : @entity4 says he is hoping to become ' one of the best ' at @entity3 after leaving @entity9 sounds exciting ? he is and that ’s exactly the word which has been used to describe him			1
@entity23 journalist @entity139 told the @entity140 : ‘ the most common thing that is said about him is that he ’s very much like @entity130			0
this is because it ’s true and because he gets the fans excited			0
‘ he is very similar to what @entity130 was when he was 24			0
he is a wonderful player and he is someone that the supporters will certainly enjoy watching			0
’ so where will he fit into @entity3 ’s side ? with @entity23 compatriot @entity148 currently out of favour on @entity150 , @entity4 could well operate in the attacking domain he once populated			1
@entity148 was used in an advanced role on either flank or , on occasion , through the middle , and that is where @entity46 is likely to deploy his new signing			0
sounds too good to be true , so when will he be following @entity61 to @entity159 ? ! let him get his debut out of the way first …			0

@entity4 signed for a *fee* in region of £ 12m from @entity9
@entity28 international is @entity3 's fourth signing of summer
he joins @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 at @entity19
