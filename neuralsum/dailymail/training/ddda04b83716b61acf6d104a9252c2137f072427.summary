e-cigarettes can contain higher amounts of certain toxins than regular cigarettes , according to @entity5 scientists			1
researchers at the @entity7 found vapour emitted by the gadgets contains the toxic element chromium , which is not found in traditional cigarettes , as well as four times more nickel than found in traditional tobacco			1
the electronic replacements also contain lead , zinc and other toxic metals , although in lower levels than cigarettes			1
professor @entity20 , from the @entity7 said the raised levels of toxic metals found in electronic cigarettes are concerning , although overall his research found e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes			1
researchers at the @entity7 found vapour emitted by the gadgets contains the toxic element chromium , which is not found in traditional cigarettes , as well as four times more nickel than found in traditional tobacco he said : ‘ our results demonstrate that overall electronic cigarettes seem to be less harmful than regular cigarettes , but their elevated content of toxic metals such as nickel and chromium do raise concerns			1
’ lead author of the study , @entity39 , added : ' the metal particles likely come from the cartridge of the e-cigarette devices themselves – which opens up the possibility that better manufacturing standards for the devices could reduce the quantity of metals in the smoke			0
' studies of this kind are necessary for implementing effective regulatory measures			0
e-cigarettes are so new , there just is n’t much research available on them yet			0
' for this study , the researchers conducted all of the experiments in offices and rooms			0
while volunteer subjects were smoking regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes , the researchers collected particles in the indoor air and studied the chemical content and sources of the samples			1
' offices and rooms – not laboratories – are the environments where you ’re likely to be exposed to second - hand e-cigarette smoke , so we did our testing there to better simulate real - life exposure conditions , ' dr @entity39 said			0
the research comes after the @entity83 issued a report advising that the use of e-cigarettes should be banned indoors and all advertising stopped until the industry produces ‘ convincing supporting scientific evidence and obtains regulatory approval ’			1
professor @entity20 , from the @entity7 , branded the findings a ' concern ' backing this call , @entity93 , deputy chair of the @entity96 ’s board of science called for further regulation of e-cigarettes			1
he told @entity99 tight controls are needed so that they are n't aggressively marketed towards young people and so that their sale does n't normalise the act of smoking			1
he said : ‘ tighter controls are needed to ensure their use does not undermine current tobacco control measures and reinforces the normalcy of smoking behaviour			0
' there is a need for research to understand the health impacts of e-cigarettes on both the user and bystanders , and it is vital that the sale of e-cigarettes is appropriately regulated to ensure they are not sold to minors , and are not aggressively marketed to young people as tobacco was in the past			1
’ he added that health claims made by companies selling e-cigarettes need to be backed up by independent scientific evidence			2
he said : ‘ any health claims must be substantiated by robust independent scientific evidence to ensure that the consumer is fully informed regarding potential benefits and risks of e-cigarettes			2
’ e-cigarettes sold in the north east of @entity136 were found to contain a chemical called diacetyl , which can cause serious lung disease when inhaled e-cigarettes sold in the north east of @entity136 were found to contain a chemical called diacetyl , which can cause serious lung disease when inhaled			1
diacetyl - used to add butterscotch flavour to liquid tobacco - is harmless to eat , but when inhaled is known to cause a serious condition called ‘ popcorn lung ’ , or bronchiolitis obliterans			2
‘ popcorn lung ’ , which struck workers in popcorn factories who inhaled large amounts of diacetyl , is an irreversible disease which scars the lung and makes it impossible to breathe properly			2
the e-cigarettes were being made by one of the country ’s biggest e-cigarettes firms @entity158 , and have been withdrawn following an investigation by the @entity162			1
@entity158 have withdrawn the product , and @entity164 , head of retail for the company said @entity158 was investigating how this happened			0
she told the @entity162 : ‘ this is our first issue in five years			0
we sell millions of bottles a year			0
we are very sorry it has happened , we are investigating how it has happened			0
’ dr @entity173 , consultant physician in @entity174 at @entity175 told the @entity162 that popcorn lung can sometimes be so severe it leads to a lung transplantation			2
he said : ‘ that particular chemical - diacetyl - is associated with an unusual but well - established lung condition called popcorn worker ’s lung			2
’ ‘ it has been inhaled in significant quantities in people who worked in popcorn manufacturing factories			0
’ ‘ in those individuals it has caused a very serious lung condition , serious enough to warrant lung transplantation			0

@entity5 researchers found vapour from e-cigarettes contains toxic element chromium and four times more nickel than found in normal cigarettes
they were also found to contain lead , zinc and other toxic metals
@entity83 has called for e-cigarettes to be banned indoors and advertising stopped until industry provides evidence for claims
@entity96 has called for tighter regulation of the gadgets so they ca n't be aggressively marketed to minors
@entity162 investigation found toxic chemical *dialectyl* in one brand of e-cigarettes , which when inhaled can lead to serious lung disease
