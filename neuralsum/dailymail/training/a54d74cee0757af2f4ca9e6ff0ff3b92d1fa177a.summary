astonishingly , police officers and prison guards even refused to allow her to take the daily medicine she needs to combat her liver disease			1
‘ by the end of my ordeal i felt shattered and very weak , ’ she said , adding : ‘ i was treated worse than a dog			2
my first cell was n’t fit for a dog – let alone a 72 - year - old grandmother			1
‘ and when i told a guard that i was in jail for hugging my granddaughter his jaw dropped in open - mouthed amazement			1
he was astonished and horrified			0
‘ i deserve an apology and compensation for the way i have been treated			0
’ mrs @entity3 was originally sentenced in her absence to three months in jail by the @entity14 in april for hugging her granddaughter			1

it launched the legal proceedings when it received photographic evidence of the hug			0
in an extraordinary move , she was arrested on sunday night within minutes of sitting in her seat at @entity71 to watch the comedian @entity70			0
describing her arrest , she said : ‘ i was just sitting down to enjoy the show when a doorman told me that there was someone there to see me			0

’ she was taken to @entity98 police station where she claims she was mocked by the duty officers and refused food and medicine all night			1
‘ they put me in a cell without giving me an evening meal , ’ mrs @entity3 said			1

at this stage i felt i was wilting			0
’ mrs @entity3 refused to leave the cell until she was given her medicine			1
ignoring her request , officers then grabbed her by the wrists and bundled her into a prison van , an ordeal which she said left her with cuts and bruises			1

the grandmother then spent a further two days locked up before she was able to appear before a circuit judge yesterday			2
as the old year turns to the new , @entity3 ’s ordeal is a chilling reminder of what a secretive society @entity167 remains – and the unrestrained powers the authorities can exercise when the public is denied its right to know			1
refused access to the @entity14 , this paper has no idea whether or not there were good reasons for banning mrs @entity3 from contacting her granddaughter			1
what we do know for sure is that there can never be any justification for a judge sentencing a 72 - year - old to prison in her absence , without giving the public a full explanation of why			2
let 2015 , the 800th anniversary of @entity190 , be the year this kafkaesque court is thrown open to the light of accountability			2
