@entity0 has been on the charm offensive in recent months , eager to prove it does value its customers , despite previous claims to the contrary			1
which is probably why it was so quick to jump on a claim on @entity8 that a woman was being charged extra for her ' emotional baggage '			2
comedian @entity11 managed to confuse the airline with a tongue - in - cheek tweet stating : ' what a disgrace , there 's a woman crying at the @ @entity0 check in desk who 's been made to pay more for emotional baggage			1
the presenter and comedian wrote : ' i ca n't believe @entity0 have just fallen for this joke lol retweet ! ! ! ' the tweet was immediately picked up by his followers and has been retweeted 1,100 times and ' favourited ' 689 times			1
@entity0 boss @entity42 is normally known for having a sense of humour but it seems @entity0 's sense of humour returned quickly enough			1
when asked for comment about the incident , a spokesperson said : ' as the fastest responding airline on @entity8 in @entity53 , we pride ourselves on the speed of our customer service			2
comedian @entity11 posted the joke on @entity8 ' we apologise for temporary technical difficulties with our sarcasm detector today			1
' airline ceo @entity42 is famed for his sense of humour , often joking about at press conferences			0
however , his outspoken manner , threatening all sorts of additional airline charges from a so - called fat tax to a fee for using the toilet , has seen the airline become increasingly unpopular with passengers			0
the joke @entity8 conversation came as an 85 - year - old grandmother really was left in tears at @entity74 after being refused travel for trying to travel to @entity76 using a bus pass as identification			0
@entity79 , from @entity80 , @entity81 , had used the permit to prove who she was on the outbound flight , however @entity86 staff at @entity74 - acting as third party agents for @entity0 - advised her that this form of @entity89 was not acceptable for the return journey			1
a @entity0 spokesman told @entity92 : ' customers flying domestically within the @entity94 should travel with a passport or driving licence			2
in rare cases , where customers have no other form of @entity89 , travel may be permitted with a bus pass			0
the airline launched a charm offensive last year in a bid to win over customers ' we have asked our third party handling agent at @entity74 ( @entity86 ) to explain why this issue was not escalated and ensure it does not recur			0
' we sincerely apologise to mrs @entity79 and transferred her free of charge onto the next available flight that day , however she chose not to travel			0
' as a gesture of goodwill , we are offering mrs @entity79 a free return flight from @entity76 to @entity74 and hope she will fly with us once more			0

comedian and presenter @entity11 tweeted the joke to @entity0
the airline responded asking where he had seen the woman crying
@entity117 's followers rushed to retweet @entity0 's gaffe
