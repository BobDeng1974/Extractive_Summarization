this month marks a year since father @entity0 put up his first controversial message on the signage board outside @entity3			1
the message read : ' @entity5 , some people are gay			2
it was a statement that certainly grabbed the attention of not only local passersby but also gained an international audience			2
and his outspoken views were not just confined to gay marriage			1
his thoughts on @entity19 's asylum seeker policy , climate change and coal seam gas have also been expressed in huge letters			1
his unique way of engaging with the community began when he was visiting a dying man who 's family tried to hide the fact that he was gay			0
father @entity0 said he did n't want people to assume that he was anti-gay because he was @entity46 and a priest ' that 's when i thought to myself : " hang on , i do n't want people to assume that just because i 'm a @entity46 and i 'm a priest that i would be anti-gay " , ' he told @entity50			1
' because i 'm not			0
i 'm actually a very vocal supporter of marriage equality			1
' so i wanted to say to the community , do n't assume that all @entity5 are conservative			1
' since then , the church 's @entity29 page has taken off - now with 12,607 likes			0
' it 's just incredible			0
on a good week we get up to 300,000 views , ' he said			1
' it â€™s not unusual to get about 80,000 to 100,000 views			2
' but father @entity0 's progressive views have n't gone without criticism			1
while other conservative priests have confronted @entity32 for his beliefs , he 's also received threats and abuse from the public			1
' lots of hate mail , hate emails , hate tweets and hate posts , ' he said			1
' the ban button gets a bit of a work out sometimes			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity78 , which the @entity3 parish belongs to , declined to comment on @entity32 's views			2
what the priest finds most concerning is the level of hatred @entity19 have towards others			2
' i think the ones that i find most deeply disturbing are the ones targeted at vulnerable people , ' he said			0
' people saying things like " if they [ refugees and asylum seekers ] all drowned that would solve the problem "			1
' one particular anonymous hate mail still remains in the forefront of his memory			1
the priest says he disagrees with @entity19 prime minister @entity101 's stance on asylum seekers father @entity0 hopes to ' promote a society in which the vulnerable are cared for , in which the minority are embraced and in which human beings can flourish ' ' someone sent me a photocopied image of the boat breaking up on @entity113 , ' he said			1
' he pasted a carton of beer and a bottle of champagne on the picture and wrote " this is something to celebrate "			0
' it was a graphic example of the kind of heart that i want to change			0
' although the positive response definitely outweighs the bad , @entity32 says the criticism can ' some days eat into your soul a bit '			2
he believes media moguls like @entity129 sometimes have a negative influence on society			0
' i think responsible journalism is one of the greatest gifts that can be given to a democracy , ' he said			0
' but i think when a powerful media provider is so focused on one area of the political spectrum , i think that can be very unhealthy for society			0
' so @entity32 wants his message of compassion and generosity to be loud and clear			0
' for me it 's really about the heart and emotion			0
who we are as people and who we want to be as people , ' he said			0
' i hope to promote a society in which the vulnerable are cared for , in which the minority are embraced and in which human beings can flourish			0
' the @entity159 priest says responsible journalism is an essential element to a healthy democracy			2
however he found that media mogul @entity129 ' focused on one area of the political spectrum ' father @entity0 said he received a lot of criticism from other conservative priest and also was sent hate mail from the public about his view on marriage equality father @entity0 makes no secret of his feelings towards immigration minister @entity175 he even suggests mr @entity175 's actions are illegal and he should face court in the @entity178 father @entity0 also weighs into environmental issues , such as coal seam gas , a hot topic in his constituency forget the race that stops a nation every november , @entity19 stops all races , according to the churchman father @entity0 also feels strongly about education funding after the jailing of @entity19 journalist @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity32 took another swipe at the prime minister but @entity19 's asylum seeker policy is his favourite topic of discussion , linking the issue to his devout faith the controversial federal budget , which has prompted nationwide protests , is also not off limits			1
