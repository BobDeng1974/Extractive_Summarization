@entity10 's neighbor @entity9 , a self - proclaimed medium , clairvoyant , and healer bought half her land unbeknownst to @entity14 for $ 275 and says she 'll only return it for $ 35,000			1
@entity14 's home has an address in @entity18 , @entity2 and @entity19 , @entity3 and after having her home refinanced a few years ago her bank failed to pay the $ 200 annual property tax for the @entity2 portion of her property thereby forfeiting her ownership of the land			1
@entity10 , whose residence stands both in @entity2 and @entity3 , lost half of her home to her neighbor @entity9 because her mortgage servicer did n't pay her @entity2 property taxes @entity30 reports that it was n't until @entity10 decided that she wanted to build a shed near the property line with her neighbor that she became aware of the sale			1
' they told me i no longer owned my land , ' @entity14 recalled			0
' i was like , ' what do you mean i do n't own that property ? i 've owned this property since 1997			0
' @entity41 reports that no one is trying to evict @entity14 and her neighbor apparently wants the yard and not the house but @entity14 has been paying her homeowner 's insurance and the upkeep of her neighbor 's property without even knowing it no longer belonged to her			2
@entity53 's lawyer @entity52 said that a sign posted on a tree reading ' property sale ' led his client to buy the land and that she had no motives other than to acquire more land legally			0
' there was a yellow sign posted on the tree announcing a real - estate sale , and she decided she wanted to snap it up , ' @entity52 said			0
' who would n't want to make their property larger ? she bid on the property , and to her delight , there she goes — she has a larger property			0
' two state solution ? : the tax confusion began when @entity14 refinanced her mortgage in 2004 and continued through a second refinance in 2006 but her bank did n't pay her @entity2 property taxes when @entity14 asked for her land back @entity53 said she could buy it for $ 150,000 but later lowered her asking price to $ 35,000			1
' i 'm just an average person living my life , ' said @entity14 , an electrical contractor			0
' my neighbor is an opportunist			0
she was looking for something for nothing			0
' @entity14 says she received no notice that her taxes were n't being paid and feels as though she has been victimized			2
@entity30 reports that the tax confusion began when @entity14 refinanced her mortgage in 2004 and continued through a second refinance in 2006			2
@entity14 used to pay only her @entity3 property taxes via an escrow account and wrote a check to @entity102 , @entity2 for the land			1
in 2004 , @entity105 officials told her they also needed to put money for the @entity2 taxes into the escrow account			0
two taxes : @entity14 's home has an address in @entity18 , @entity2 and @entity19 , @entity3 and after having her home refinanced a few years ago her bank failed to pay the $ 200 annual property tax however , the bank never paid the bill and it sold the loan in 2010 to @entity120 @entity122 law says that a property owner must be notified by mail if there will be a foreclosure			1
@entity14 only receives mail at her @entity3 address and her @entity2 mailbox is sealed which may explain why she did n't receive the notice			1
@entity14 's lawyer @entity133 says that if mailing a letter to the resident fails , the postmaster must ask for an alternate address or publish the foreclosure in a public place like a newspaper or county clerk 's office			2
@entity14 wants to overturn her foreclosure case in front of @entity146 @entity145 but because she did n't bring action within the two year statute of limitations it ’s problematic			1
in talks before the court date , @entity14 said she was aghast by her neighbor 's initial demand of $ 150,000 , now down to $ 35,000			1
@entity53 's lawyer said the mortgage company would make the payment not @entity14 , but @entity14 has n't accepted the settlement yet			2
' i feel like i was the one who was damaged and victimized , ' she said			0
' i do n't think it 's fair that my neighbor should profit			0

@entity10 's neighbor @entity9 bought half her land unbeknownst to @entity14 for $ 275 and says she 'll only return it for $ 35,000
@entity14 's home has an address in @entity2 and @entity3 and after having her home refinanced her bank failed to pay @entity2 property tax
@entity14 plans to overturn her foreclosure case in front of @entity146 @entity145
because @entity14 did n't bring action within the two year statute of limitations ( because she did n't know it was sold ) the case could be problematic
@entity9 says she only wants @entity14 's yard and says the mortgage company would pay $ 35,000 , not @entity14
@entity14 still thinks it 's ' *unfair* ' that her neighbor will profit while she is ' victimized '
