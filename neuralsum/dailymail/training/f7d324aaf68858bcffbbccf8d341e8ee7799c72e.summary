by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 5 august 2013 mr @entity3 s treasury team , under shadow chancellor @entity1 , will today cite a new @entity5 poll which has found that 81 per cent believe that politicians who say household incomes have grown faster than price rises workers are on average earning £ 1,350 a year less in real terms than when @entity11 came to office in may 2010 , figures show			1
@entity15 will try to revive @entity17 ’s stumbling leadership with an assault on the rising cost of living under the @entity20			1
and they will publish a poll showing that 81 per cent of voters believe prices have grown quicker over the last year than their household incomes			2
they will contrast that with official figures showing that bonuses in financial services soared in april by 82 per cent compared to the year before as bankers delayed their bonuses to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in the pound which came into effect that month			2
the media blitz comes amid growing concern among @entity40 that mr @entity17 has let the @entity41 and @entity42 set the political agenda over recent weeks			1
the @entity15 leader has gone on holiday to @entity46 and given up his mobile phone , so colleagues can only contact him through his wife @entity49			1
yesterday @entity15 mp @entity50 complained : ‘ @entity15 ’s shadow cabinet is almost invisible in repose when it ’s an ideal time to attack ministers who are on the beach			1
it ’s a huge mistake and it ’s not good enough			0
we need to be energetic , not slumbering			0
’ the new line of attack on living standards is an admission that @entity15 ’s previous economic attacks on the lack of growth are defunct now that the economy is recovering			1
mr @entity17 ’s treasury team , under shadow chancellor @entity1 , will today cite a new @entity5 poll which has found that 81 per cent believe that politicians who say household incomes have grown faster than price rises , as @entity71 claimed last month , are ‘ out of touch ’			1
the survey also found that 70 per cent believe recent improvements in the economy have not benefited middle and lower income families			0
squeeze : how average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms since the coalition was formed in may 2010 cost of living : inflation is still more than 2.5 per cent , compared to wage rises of around 1.5 per cent shadow treasury minister @entity83 said : ‘ working people know they are worse off under the @entity41 as prices continue to rise faster than wages			1
' families have also seen their tax credits and childcare support stripped back while @entity11 has prioritised a tax cut for millionaires			0
‘ the overwhelming majority of people rightly think that ministers like @entity71 , who claim that families are better off , are totally out of touch			0
this may feel like a recovery for those at the top , but for everyone else life is getting harder			0
’ she spoke out as a @entity105 poll found 53 per cent of @entity15 supporters agreed @entity17 is ‘ hesitant			1
’ @entity108 half , 48 per cent said he is ‘ trying to find himself ’ , 45 per cent called him ‘ lacklustre ’ and 37 per cent ‘ confused			0
’ in a further challenge to mr @entity17 ’s authority , mr @entity17 has been summoned to crisis talks with the 15 unions who give money to @entity15 over his reforms to the relationship between party and paymasters			1
rise : bonus pay rose dramatically in april this year as the top rate of tax fell , according to figures from the @entity125 but the plan , which will end the automatic payment of fees from unions to @entity15 , has been dismissed as ‘ gamble ’ that will leave @entity15 ’s finances in ‘ mayhem ’			1
@entity133 , who chairs the trade union group of @entity40 , said he believed fewer than 15 per cent of union members would opt to join @entity15 under the changes , costing the party at least £ 9 million			1
‘ it will create mayhem for the party ’s finances			0
we should have avoided that at all costs			0
‘ this is the biggest political gamble in the history of the @entity15			1
it has been described as a challenge - it ’s not			0
people are not queuing up to join @entity15 - quite the opposite			2
they are waiting to see what the party will bring to the table in its manifesto			0
@entity152 , @entity153 ’s former spin doctor , also called for more aggression from mr @entity17 , saying he should emulate the pugnacious @entity156 general @entity155 from the @entity157			2
‘ @entity17 could do with a bit more @entity155 in him			2
yes he ’s been tough enough to challenge his brother , to cut his ties with @entity153 and now to take on @entity161 and the unions			0
they all feel well and truly slapped			0
‘ but it ’s time @entity17 shouted about it			2
people who think he ’s not strong or decisive enough to be prime minister need to see the evidence			0

workers earn £ 1,350 less a year in real terms , according to @entity125
@entity15 will use *shocking* stat to attack coalition
but @entity17 is *facing* *increasing* pressure from unions
