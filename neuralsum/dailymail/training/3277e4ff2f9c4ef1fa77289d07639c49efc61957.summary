' ms @entity2 battled through the condition as her parents flew to her beside from @entity175 after being told by doctors that their daughter may not survive			1
' when my mum and dad came to the hospital , they walked straight past my bed because they did n't recognise me , ' she said			2
' so i had trouble looking at myself in the mirror			0
but the doctor told me it was n't too bad so i thought i 'd give it a go			1
' when i saw my own reflection , it scared me			0
it was n't the person i knew and i was n't sure whether the people in my life would still love me looking like this			0

' i have a high risk of going blind if i catch an infection and i have to keep my eyes protected at all times			1
that 's why i wear contact lenses but that also dries out my eyes so it 's just this vicious cycle			2
' the healing process has been tough as the 29 - year - old began blaming herself			1
' i guess afterwards i felt a lot of anger because i kept thinking that i should 've never taken those tablets , ' she said			0
' i cried a few times but i 'm grateful that i was able to fight this thing			0
it 's a rare condition and many kids who go through it do n't make it			0
' now the irony is that i ca n't produce tears anymore			0
i 've actually run out of tears as a result of @entity39			0
that 's why my eyes are so dry			2
my tear ducts do n't function anymore so i do n't produce tears anymore			0

' as a way of healing i decided to document how i 'm learning to live in my new skin , ' she said			2
