what is it about islands ? small inhabited lumps of rock are inevitably associated with strange goings on			1
think dr @entity6 and the @entity7 , the @entity8 and , er , @entity9			1
@entity10 are home to mysteries , buried treasure and dark secrets			1
i have never been to an island i ’ve disliked			1
@entity17 , the @entity19 statelet in the @entity20 is no different			1
a few years ago there were hysterical stories about satanic cults – fantasies which evaporated under scrutiny			1
a place of poise and majesty : @entity17 's grand history is visible in structures such as @entity31 sniffy writers tiresomely refer to the island ’s ‘ sinister @entity33 ’			1
they rarely point out that with a ratio of about one @entity38 soldier per every two inhabitants during the @entity41 occupation , resistance would have been worse than useless			2
since the war , @entity17 has acquired another reputation , like @entity46 ’s @entity45 ’s @entity44 , a ‘ sunny place for shady people ’			1
the decision , made in the 1960s , to turn the island into a tax haven , has certainly had a host of unintended consequences - and i think , on balance , that it was a mistake			1
but the popular belief that @entity17 is no more than a colony of perma - tanned , gin - swilling tax - dodgers is a misconception			2
i have family on @entity17 , and have been visiting since the 1960s			1
this little place , which i love for all its eccentricities , is perhaps one of the most surreal anomalies in @entity66			2
@entity68 yet not - @entity68 , a fiscal loophole incarnate			2
@entity17 has a land area of just 45 square miles – less than a quarter of the size of the @entity72			2
despite this there are thirteen police forces			2
the island ’s roads labour under one of the highest concentrations of high - powered supercars and off - roaders anywhere in the world			2
yet the island speed limit is 40mph , so few of the @entity85 ever get out of second gear , and 4x4s regularly get stuck in the narrow lanes			2
casting the net : @entity17 is a glorious location for a family holiday everywhere here has a @entity94 name			1
@entity95 , was until quite recently , codified in a dialect of @entity97 - and @entity94 civil law , to this day , underpins much of the island ’s legal codes			2
some of the older inhabitants still speak @entity102 , the old @entity97 - @entity94 dialect , and yet this is a patriotic @entity68 island ( albeit one that is not in the @entity68 )			2
there can not be a more child - friendly destination in the @entity107			0
the sheltered bays of the south and east offer safe paddling and swimming , and @entity17 must have more rock pools than the entire south coast of @entity115			1
older children will like the @entity118 , a series of underground bunkers excavated by the @entity121 ( or rather their unfortunate @entity122 ) , there are two splendid castles ( @entity31 and @entity124 ) and the bizarre and rather wonderful @entity125 , an adventure park run by a farmer that is the diametric opposite to the @entity129 experience			1
the hotels are pretty good too			0
there are some beauties right on the sea			0
one of the best is @entity134 on @entity135 , probably the finest all - round beach on the island ( lots of sand at all tides , calm sea , safe , warm )			1
then there is the food			0
@entity17 may , in many ways , be more @entity68 than @entity68 itself - but the island ’s cuisine is superb			0
back in the early 1970s , when the mainland laboured under the appalling tyranny of salad cream , frozen fish and tinned fruit , @entity17 was awash with fresh seafood , extraordinary cream , sublime fruit and , of course , the finest potatoes on @entity157 – grown traditionally in seaweed - fertilised soil			1
i remember , as a small boy , being introduced to things like fresh pasta and gourmet burgers – years before such things were known back home			1
a special form of tranquility : @entity17 is blessed with pristine beaches , such as @entity169 , on the south coast today it is almost impossible to eat badly on @entity17			1
take your pick , but my favourites are @entity175 , on the magnificent @entity176 , an epic sweep of sand on the island ’s @entity179			0
this informal place serves brilliant local fish and shellfish , and tender meats			0
and it is on one of the best beaches in @entity66			0
round the corner , on lovely @entity135 ’s @entity20 , is the @entity188 – which does serve crab , is not a shack and is again , right on the beach			1
there are no fewer than four @entity194 - starred places on the island ( nine miles by five , remember )			0
this is not a place to come on a diet			0
at least you can swim it all off afterwards			0
@entity17 has long prided itself on its turquoise , unpolluted seas			0
the beaches are , if anything , best in the west and north , but all have their fans			0
my favourite is @entity211 on the island ’s northwest tip , with caves , rockpools and ice - cream yellow sands at low tide			0
the water never gets truly cold , and plenty of locals swim all year round			0
yes , there is too much traffic , and yes , @entity17 would do well to go back to earning its living from fishing , farming and tourism rather than managing other people ’s money - but this is an exquisite place			0
and autumn is a good time to come			0
@entity17 is about 100 miles south of the @entity68 mainland , often just enough to push it into the warmth and dryness of @entity94			1
when it comes to the weather and food - if not the politics - vive la difference			0
@entity240 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies direct from @entity241 to @entity17 from £ 56 return			0
there are ferries from @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 - a one way ticket ( with a car ) with @entity250 ( 0845 609 1024 , www.condorferries.co.uk ) costs from £ 49.50 per person			0
double rooms at @entity253 ( 0845 458 0901 , www.handpickedhotels.co.uk/lhorizon ) in @entity135 ’s @entity20 , start at £ 156 , on a bed - and - breakfast basis .			1

the biggest of the @entity257 is a wonderful haven for family holidays
despite its reputation as a financial services *hotpsot* , it still has *gentle* charm
@entity135 's @entity20 , on the south coast , is a splendid spot for fresh seafood
