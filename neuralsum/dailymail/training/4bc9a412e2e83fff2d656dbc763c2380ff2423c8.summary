by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 is sending 300 staff to cover @entity4 – 28 more than it is sending to the @entity5 in @entity6 just weeks before			1
the astonishing number of employees will descend on the four - day music event to provide wall - to - wall television and radio coverage , at a time when the @entity13 is under pressure to make budget cuts			0
yesterday campaigners claimed the staffing plans were ‘ overkill ’ and amounted to little more than a ‘ jolly ’ for staff			0
the @entity2 will send more staff for its coverage of @entity4			1
this year 's presenting team including @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 in total there will be 250 hours of @entity4 coverage , the same as last year when the @entity2 faced criticism that it was giving the festival too much airtime			1
headliners for this year ’s event are @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , with acts such as @entity37 and @entity38 also among those who will play			1
it will be spread across all @entity2 channels , as well as @entity42 , radio two , @entity43 , the red button and the @entity2 website , including an edition of @entity47 from the festival site in @entity49			0
coverage will be hosted by a team of 17 presenters including including @entity24 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity23 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , with @entity22 and @entity61 hosting the @entity4 edition of @entity47			2
the @entity2 said the number of employees going to the festival is reflective of the ‘ demanding workload ’ and that all 300 have a ‘ clear and accountable ’ role			1
the @entity2 is broadcasting 30 hours of tv coverage across its channels and more than 50 hours of radio by comparison , this year ’s @entity5 coverage has seen a reduction in numbers on the 295 who staffed the @entity77 contest			1
@entity79 , director of the @entity80 ’ @entity78 , branded it an ‘ inappropriate ’ use of resources , saying : ‘ taxpayers will be deeply suspicious that their money is being used to send staff on a jolly			0
‘ the @entity2 is already sending 272 people to @entity6 for the @entity5 , and sending another 300 to @entity4 does seem like overkill			1
people will be watching the coverage closely – it had better be worth the expense			0
’ last year the @entity2 faced similar criticism after spending £ 2million sending a 296 - strong team to the festival			2
there were further complaints over the quality of broadcasts , with music fans branding presenters ‘ annoying ’ and accusing them of filling time with ‘ boring chit chat ’			0
@entity2 music chief @entity101 yesterday defended this year ’s staffing decision , saying : ‘ we ’re sending the same number of people as last year and , whilst some will inevitably still argue this is too many , i can assure you that every member of staff on - site has a clear and accountable role , working long hours to offer unparalleled coverage for our audience			1
‘ we have worked hard in recent years to identify areas where resources can be shared or tasks more easily undertaken off - site			0
’ @entity35 have proved a controversial headliner with some festival - goers unhappy they are topping the bill ' whilst we are working hard to ensure we are being as efficient as possible , we will not compromise the quality of our output and we have been robust in scrutinising our plans and minimising costs			0
' @entity35 have proved a controversial booking for the event with some festival - goers unhappy that a hard rock act are topping the bill			2
some have said the group ’s inclusion is against the event ’s environmental ethos , as frontman @entity134 supports bear hunting			0
mr @entity101 said he hoped the @entity2 coverage of the band ’s performance would do justice to their renowned ' powerful , pyrotechnical performances '			2
but he added : ' if metal is n’t your cup of tea however , there will be plenty of alternatives just a few clicks away on your tablets or interactive tvs			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' broadcasting comprehensive , high - quality coverage of major cultural events requires this level of resource and every member of staff onsite has a clear and accountable role , working long hours to offer more than 250 hours of unrivalled coverage across to audiences across tv , radio and online .			1
