@entity0 can understand the reasoning why @entity2 will not be making his second debut with @entity4 this weekend			1
on the advice of doctors , @entity2 is absent from the season - opening @entity8 @entity7 after sustaining concussion following a heavy crash on the final day of the second pre-season test last month			1
fears were expressed to @entity2 of ' second - impact syndrome ' whereby a serious brain injury , or even death , could occur should the 33 - year - old be involved in a second incident so soon after the first			1
@entity0 walks through the paddock at the @entity21 circuit ahead of the @entity8 @entity7 after several weeks testing ( above ) , the @entity23 season gets underway in @entity25 on sunday despite that there has been scepticism of the decision , particularly as @entity2 spent three days in a local hospital and passed a variety of tests			1
@entity0 knows what it is like to suffer concussion as he was involved in a severe accident in practice for the 2003 @entity38 , yet just a fortnight later was back behind the wheel of his car in @entity41			1
on reflection , @entity0 knows he should arguably have never driven in that subsequent race , so can understand the precautions taken with @entity2 , even if they appear extreme			1
' as far as i know he ( @entity2 ) had three days ( in hospital ) undergoing every scan and check under the sun , ' said @entity0			1
' i 'm sure whatever they 've chosen to do is the correct decision			0
the @entity53 @entity23 driver understands why @entity4 team - mate @entity2 will miss the race @entity2 suffered concussion after a high speed crash at the @entity57 on february 22 ' concussions vary			1
some are very light , and then you have different grades of concussion , brain damage			0
' for me , i raced two weeks after an accident in @entity65 in 2003 , with checks of standing on a box , closing one eye and whatever else i had to do			2
' to be honest , i scraped through , so they let me race , but that was nearly 13 years ago			0
now the checks are very stringent			0
' with the incidents we 've had , in particular with @entity76 ( @entity77 in @entity78 last year ) , the medical people are going to be more strict , and so they should be			0
' a helicopter takes @entity2 to hospital after the former world champion crashed during pre-season testing the @entity84 waves to supporters after leaving hospital , having passed numerous tests despite @entity2 's incident at @entity88 's @entity57 , @entity0 insists he has no issues with the car			1
initially , speculation centred on mechanical failure or an electrical issue given the new @entity4 is now powered by @entity94			2
the @entity96 - based marque , however , categorically ruled out any such faults and instead stated a freak gust of wind played its part in the double world champion veering off track and into a wall			0
heading into sunday 's race at @entity25 's @entity21 , despite the lack of running throughout testing given numerous other glitches , @entity0 maintains the car is one of the best he has driven			1
@entity0 was involved in a serious accident at the 2003 @entity38 before returning two weeks later ' competitiveness is impossible to say , but in terms of feel and how the car is and what you want it to do , it does everything right and a lot better than last year , ' assessed @entity0			1
' this car is very different in that it does what you hope it will do , which is very important for myself , and also for @entity2 as far as i can see			2
' the basic philosophy of the car and idea of the aerodynamics and how it works is definitely right			0
i have n't driven a @entity4 like this before , not in the way it works			2
' i 'm not saying it 's the quickest @entity4 i have ever driven , because it 's not , but in the way it works , the basic car is very good			0
' @entity4 reserve driver @entity135 will race in @entity2 's absence at the @entity8 @entity7 whilst @entity0 is confident of finishing sunday 's race , he appreciates @entity94 are a long way off from challenging their main rivals			1
' you are going to have doubts , and it would be stupid not to have doubts when you look at winter testing because we have n't completed a simulated race distance yet , ' said @entity0			2
' yes , i do know it 's going to be a tough start , but it 's also very different			0
' the last two years have not been the easiest seasons for us , but i think the difference with this year is the understanding there could be something very special on the horizon with @entity94			0
@entity0 looks on as the @entity158 concept vehicle at a @entity160 press conference ' the whole team is unbelievably excited about what could happen in the future			2
' but we also understand there 's a lot of work needed before we even start thinking too much about winning races , even podiums and fighting for the world championship			0
' it 's a great base for the future , but it is going to take time			0
it 's not going to be an overnight thing			0
