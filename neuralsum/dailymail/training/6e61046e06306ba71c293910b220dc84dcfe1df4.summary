by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 12:19 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 4 april 2013 new ' @entity4 ' host @entity3 will more than double his multi-million dollar salary when he takes over from outgoing host @entity7 next year on the top - rated @entity9 show			1
industry insiders predict that @entity11 will see the $ 5 million he gets for fronting ' @entity13 ' boosted to $ 12 million when he goes head - to - head with @entity16 ' @entity15 and @entity18 's @entity17 in february			2
even though that is three million less than the $ 15 million @entity7 reportedly takes home , it still represents a massive show of faith in @entity11 , who has been working late night television for less than five years			1
the move , anticipated for weeks now , will officially take place following the network 's broadcast of the @entity32			1
the 62 - year - old @entity7 - who was temporarily removed from the show in 2009 in favor of @entity47 - had made repeated jokes about his bosses and the network in recent weeks while rumors swirled over the latest move			1
but he and @entity11 , 38 , presented a united front while announcing the news			0
they recently made a parody video set to a tune from @entity58 that lampooned their situation			0
' the main difference between this and the other time is i ’m part of the process			2
the last time the decision was made without me			2
i came into work one day and — you ’re out , ' @entity7 said , comparing his previous ouster and now			1
' this time around there really are n’t any complications like there were the last time , ' he added , according to the @entity75			2
' this time it feels right			1
' @entity7 , whose salary was a reported $ 15 million following a recent pay cut , also said in a press release : ' @entity80			1
i hope you 're as lucky as me and hold on to the job until you 're the old guy			0
if you need me , i 'll be at the garage			0
' laughing his way to the bank : @entity7 has been on an @entity88 joke offensive since reports emerged saying @entity11 , pictured , would be replacing him at tonight @entity11 , whose @entity90 began at 12:35 a.m. , added : ' i ’m really excited to host a show that starts today instead of tomorrow			1
' ' i have nothing but respect for @entity7 , ' @entity11 said			1
' if it were n’t for him , i would n’t have a show to be taking over			2
' @entity11 currently earns $ 5 million as host of @entity90 and it is predicted he could earn as much as $ 12 million in his new role , according to @entity100			0
the exact terms of his new deal were not immediately disclosed			0
but the show will be relocated from @entity105 to @entity106 , where the program started in 1954 when @entity108 was its host			1
@entity7 - aside from the brief interruption when @entity47 hosted the program - has been the show 's presenter since 1992			1
he has routinely been tops in the ratings , even as @entity9 's primetime and daytime programming has fallen off			2
' i ’m glad i ’ve kept it no. 1 , ” @entity7 said			1
' when i started people said , " oh the only reason you ’re winning is because of ‘ er , " or " the only reason you ’re winning is because @entity124 came on and said that one thing			0
" well , at least now i can say the only reason we ’re winning is cause we ’re winning			0
' after leaving , he said he expects to be ' back on the road , being a comedian again			0
' in competition ? @entity7 and @entity3 have been the mainstay of @entity9 's late night schedule for the past three years with reports now saying @entity11 will take over tonight ' @entity134 ' producer @entity133 , who also produces ' @entity90 ' , will take over as producer of the new ' @entity4			1
' @entity11 's replacement at 12:35 a.m. was not named , although @entity137 of " @entity134 " is considered a strong candidate			0
@entity9 is worried that @entity18 's @entity17 , whose show recently started at the 11:35 p.m. time slot , will establish himself as a go - to late night performer for a younger generation if the network did n't move swiftly to install @entity11			1
@entity17 took to @entity144 to jokingly offer his congratulations to his new counterpart			0
' congratulations to my dear , sweet @ jimmyfallon - a formidable rival and an incredible lover			0
' but the move also has the potential to backfire with @entity7 's fans , who did not embrace @entity47 when @entity7 was temporarily moved to prime time a few years ago			1
@entity47 held onto the job for just eight months before being replaced by his predecessor			1
@entity47 now hosts a show on cable network @entity159			1
next generation ? : with @entity11 's ascension to the top chair , @entity137 , right , is considered the favorite to take over the 12:35 a.m. show @entity47 briefly replaced @entity7 as host of @entity4 in 2009 until @entity9 executives reversed their decision			1
he now hosts a show on @entity159 @entity7 , whose contract expires next year , has n't always sounded so gracious over @entity11 taking over			1
he has recently used comedy as a weapon against his network bosses - branding a recent ratings boost a ' miracle ' and saying that @entity9 is a ' big number two ' in his show			0
' you know what that means ? between @entity180 and @entity181 , this is truly the season of miracles			0
we ’re number two ! i ’ve been saying for the last week that @entity9 is a big number two			0
have n’t i been saying that ? congratulations ! ' hit with youth : @entity3 has proved remarkably popular and executives believe his age and appeal to younger viewers will keep tonight on top for years to come @entity7 went on to talk about a report that @entity196 is reducing its contracts , adding : ' apparently they got the idea from @entity9			2
' the routine comes hot on the heels of other cutting remarks against executives at the network			0
@entity7 had also joked about a ' make - nice ' meeting he had with bosses the night before			2
he said to make amends they had offered to send him and his wife on a carnival cruise - the crippled liner that caused passengers to endure five nightmarish days in the @entity213			0
in another wisecrack , @entity7 cited news reports of a @entity217 man who had a knife pulled from his back after three years , he sniped : ' he must have worked at @entity9 , too			2
' rising star : @entity3 is photographed with snl creator / producer @entity133			0
@entity11 will be @entity7 's replacement on tonight , which will be executive produced by @entity133 in another routine he referred to his bosses as ' snakes			1
' ' you know the whole legend of @entity228 right ? @entity228 drove all the snakes out of @entity230 – and then they came to the @entity231 and became @entity9 executives			0
' the rapid ascent of @entity11 and his certain promotion is seen by analysts as @entity9 recognizing the competition offered by @entity18 's popular @entity17			0
while @entity7 's ' tonight ' show still tops the ratings , @entity17 moved his show to the earlier time - slot of 11.35pm to directly compete with him and @entity16 ' @entity15			1
the @entity75 report quoted one senior executive as saying , ' there is no way on earth that this is not going to happen ' - a certainty which may explain why @entity7 is n't holding back the abuse			2
' according to several reports , scientists say they are getting closer and closer to being able to do @entity252 - style cloning of extinct species , ' @entity7 , he told his audience one night			2
things that were once thought to be extinct could be brought back from the dead			0
so there ’s hope for @entity9			0

the transition will take place following next year 's @entity32
move occurred with @entity7 's *blessing* , *unlike* when he was temporarily ousted by @entity47
' this time it feels right ' @entity7 said
show will also move from @entity105 to @entity106 , where it originally started
