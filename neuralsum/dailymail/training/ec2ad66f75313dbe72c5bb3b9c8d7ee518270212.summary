by @entity0 perched on the edge of glamorous @entity4 , @entity2 's @entity1 is one of the most exclusive hotels in the world			1
beloved of the rich , famous and powerful , it has played host to everyone from prince @entity11 to @entity12 during its 90 years in existence			1
now the hotel has opened its doors to a team of documentary makers - and the results are eye - opening			2
luxury : the @entity1 in @entity2 has played host to a who 's who of @entity23 and real royalty from the guest who has ' moved in ' to the hotel , along with his pet bichon frise and mountain of @entity31 luggage , to the president demanding a room made up with entirely new bed linen , it seems there 's no limit when it comes to pleasing the people who stay there			1
one regular is @entity41 , a @entity42 celebrity hairdresser who made his millions via his salon business and decamps to the @entity1 each weekend			1
' i was born very , very poor and i remember when i was a teenager , i saw @entity1 from the front , and thought : " one day , i 'll stay here " , ' he remembers			1
' and i work very , very hard for it			2
i 'm a famous hairdresser and i work 12 to 14 hours a day			2
there is no secret - that 's how i can afford to come to @entity1 every weekend			1
' the coiffeur , who lives in @entity52 , says the secret of the hotel 's success is knowing what guests want - and delivering it before they even think to ask			2
glamorous guests : @entity60 spent 10 days at the @entity1 and princess @entity61 also visited regular visitor : celebrity hairdresser @entity41 spends every weekend at the @entity2 hotel @entity64 : @entity66 crystal chandeliers decorate the public areas at the @entity1 ' @entity1 is very unique , ' he explains			1
' i know everybody and they know what i like			2
for example , in @entity42 , we do n't do the eggs , we do n't like the omelettes			0
' we like the fresh fruit and the pastries , and they always make the special ones i like for me			0
' and mr @entity41 is by no means alone in his appreciation of the @entity1 's charms			1
joining him on the guest list is a veritable who 's who of real and @entity23 royalty - all of whom come with special requests			2
in charge of dealing with them is @entity93 , a glamorously coiffed and perfectly presented woman who has been working in hospitality for 60 years			0
' every hotel has a golden book , wherever they are in the world , ' she explains			0
' these are guest books of very vip guests who have stayed with us			1
' while most behave , not all are so considerate , among them actor @entity103			1
' there 's a story that he threw a desk out the window during a ball because he thought his one love had been unfaithful or something like that , ' she remembers			1
fine dining : guests have the choice four different restaurants to choose from and can eat in their rooms comfortable : according to manager @entity119 , the hotel is home to the most comfortable mattresses in @entity2 ' i do n't know how he could throw a desk out of the window - i really do n't know how he did it			1
' much better behaved were @entity127 and @entity128 , who immortalised the hotel in their 1933 film , @entity132			0
more recent guests have included @entity134 , @entity135 and even the @entity136 , although as @entity138 points out , @entity137 is n't the first @entity140 royal to visit			1
' @entity11 and @entity61 were here , ' she says			1
' they stayed in the @entity143			0
i 've had @entity60 here too - i had @entity60 for 10 days			0
' @entity145 , he was very nice			0
and @entity146 , i had him down here			0
and he was here when @entity145 was here and it was difficult because we did n't know he was coming , so we had to manouvre a lot and keep him happy until we could get him up to the sixth floor			0
' although no room at the @entity1 comes cheap , the sixth floor is where the most luxurious suites are to be found			1
so expensive are the rooms , the hotel wo n't publish the prices which means , glamorous though it might sound , keeping @entity23 's finest happy is an exhausting job			0
' you do wind up working through the night sometimes , ' explains @entity138			0
' especially if , like @entity161 , they 're keeping to @entity163 times			2
early riser : @entity161 insisted on being served breakfast at 4am immortal : @entity127 starred in 1933 's @entity132 visit : recent guests have included @entity135 fit for an a-lister ! each room boasts an elaborate granite and marble en - suite bathroom idyllic : the exclusive hotel boasts incredible views of @entity2 's glamorous @entity4 ' you do wind up giving them breakfast at 4am in the morning or something like that			1
' with the majority of a-listers now eschewing hotels for the privacy of rented villas , what keeps them coming back to the @entity1 ? manager @entity119 thinks she has some answers			1
' once you are inside this hotel , you feel peaceful , ' she reveals			0
' we have an open - air pool , with a beautiful bar			0
and i think , in this hotel , we have the most comfortable mattresses that i ever saw in my life			0
' that is something remarkable , ' she continues			0
' @entity202 ' wife bought two mattresses from us			0
' we have people who love to serve , to pamper people			0
we have to make sure guests are happy because , ultimately , that is what they 're here for			2
' this world : @entity1 , tonight at 9pm on @entity211			2
