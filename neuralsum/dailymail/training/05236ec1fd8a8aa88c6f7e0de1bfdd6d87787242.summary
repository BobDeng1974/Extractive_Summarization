by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor more than £ 3.5billion has been lost in benefit fraud and error , despite @entity5 ’s promise of an ‘ uncompromising ’ crackdown			2
repeated announcements about efforts to catch welfare cheats and curb bungling by officials have led to no change in the amount of money lost			2
in fact , since the coalition came to power in 2010 the amount of cash written off has risen by £ 300million			1
official figures show how fraud and error has risen in cash terms , and as a proportion of the total welfare bill has remained flat at 2.1 per cent since the coalition was formed today the @entity27 insisted it was ‘ fixing the welfare system ’ but the @entity29 has warned that the scale of the losses – up by more than 9 per cent in a last year – are ‘ unacceptable ’			1
of the £ 3.5billion lost last year , £ 1.2billion was the result of fraud , £ 1.6billion was attributed to error by benefits claimants and £ 800million was lost by officials paying out too much			1
in 2010 - 11 , the first year of the coalition , £ 3.2billion was lost in fraud and error , leading mr @entity5 to promise a ‘ tough and uncompromising ’ strategy to deal with the problem			1
in august 2010 he said : ‘ we will not shrug our shoulders and let them get away with it any longer			0
‘ we will take the necessary measures to stop fraud happening in the first place ; root out and take tough action against those found committing fraud ; and make sure the stolen money is paid back			0
’ but losses have risen every year in cash terms , and still accounts for 2.1 per cent of the total welfare budget , down slightly on the 2.2 per cent seen in 2009 - 10			1
work and pensions secretary @entity56 smith was tasked by @entity5 with tackling fraud and error @entity60 's shadow work and pensions secretary of @entity61 said : ' @entity5 and @entity62 have repeatedly promised to catch down on fraud and error in the benefits system , yet on the latest figures from government show the value of overpayments by the @entity27 rising , not falling , on their watch			1
' some £ 3.5 billion has been overpaid in benefits in the last year and millions have been written off on their flagship welfare reform , @entity74			2
ministers talk tough on benefits , but are not acting			0
it 's time for them to get a grip of fraud and error			0
' figures released today show that in 2012 - 13 £ 1.32billion was lost through almost £ 500million from @entity80 , £ 250million in @entity81 and £ 230million in @entity82			0
@entity83 accounted for £ 230million , @entity84 £ 210million , @entity85 £ 110million , the @entity86 £ 90million and @entity87 £ 80million			0
welfare minister @entity88 said : ‘ we are fixing the welfare system to stop errors and ensuring investigators have the resources to catch cheats			0
‘ the level of fraud and error in the benefits system is lower than three years ago , and only a small minority commit fraud , but we are determined to continue the battle			0
this year we expect a record number of prosecutions			2
‘ the public play a vital role in our efforts to crack down on benefit fraud and error			0
we urge anyone who suspects someone of cheating the system to report this to the benefit fraud hotline			0
’ last month the @entity29 refused to sign of the department ’s accounts because of the scale of the problem			1
in 2012 - 13 a total of £ 1.2billion was lost in fraud overpayments , including £ 800million in benefits handed out by the @entity27 and a further £ 400million lost in payments made by local councils			1
in 2011 - 12 the figure was £ 1.1billion , still markedly up on £ 800million in 2007 - 08			0
@entity84 , @entity82 and @entity80 were most likely to be used to con the taxpayer out of money , the @entity29 said , because ‘ they require the claimant to supply complete and accurate information in order to establish entitlement to benefit ’			1
the biggest scam involves claiming benefits as a single person while living with a partner , or lying about income levels and working cash in hand			2
@entity29 chief @entity138 ‘ qualified ’ the @entity27 accounts as a result of fraud and error which it was said remains ‘ unacceptably high ’			1
the accounts of the department and its predecessors have received similar qualified audit opinions since 1988 - 89 .			2
