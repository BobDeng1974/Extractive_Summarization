for 120 years it has been a great @entity1 institution , bringing world - class performances of classical music to the public			1
but now the @entity5 has been accused of dumbing down the @entity6 – by holding an @entity8 - style dance party			1
this year 's @entity6 will include a late - night concert hosted by @entity11 @entity10 , who will pay ' homage to @entity8 and its infectious , energetic brand of club music '			1
veteran dance dj @entity10 ( left ) will bring club classics to the @entity17 for this year 's @entity6			1
pictured right is cartoonist @entity20 's take on the ' dumbing down ' of the @entity6 it will take place on july 29 , coinciding with the 20th anniversary of @entity27 's broadcasts from @entity8 , and will reinterpret ' club classics ' such as @entity23 's @entity22			1
proms director @entity29 said it was a ' natural ' move , adding : ' these 20 years of dance have been a huge phenomenon on @entity27 so why not celebrate it in a @entity6 way with a big orchestra ? we do now live in a world , thank @entity38 , where you can like all kinds of music			1
' live music at the so - called @entity44 will be played by the @entity45 , which has worked with pop stars such as @entity47 , professor @entity48 and @entity49			1
when conductor sir @entity51 started the @entity6 in 1895 , he wanted to inspire the public to enjoy top - class classical music			2
he had accepted a challenge from @entity55 , manager of the new @entity56 , to ‘ run nightly concerts to train the public ’			0
the plan was to gradually raise the standard of music until they ‘ created a public for classical and modern music ’			2
sir @entity51 more than lived up to that challenge			0
he conducted the first promenade concert , as it was known , offering tickets for as little as a shilling			0
audiences could smoke , drink and eat , keeping the atmosphere informal			0
he established a tradition of playing @entity71 on mondays and @entity72 on fridays , later adding @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
the @entity6 moved to the @entity17 in 1941 after the @entity56 was bombed			1
by the time of sir @entity51 ’s death in 1944 , they were firmly established as the highlight of the classical music calendar			2
the @entity5 was accused of ' undermining ' the @entity6 by conservative @entity81 , who said : ' the @entity6 are one of the great @entity1 institutions			0
like so many institutions , it is under attack by people who think that being novel is necessarily good			0
the world loves the @entity6 as they are			0
it is extremely damaging to undermine the ethos of the @entity6 by bringing in fake originality			0
' the @entity6 already have a good , convivial finish , and that is part of the tradition , but to undermine the framework and ethos of the @entity6 is unacceptable			0
' the @entity44 is not the only surprising addition to this year 's line - up at the @entity17 , which runs from july 17 to september 12			1
there will be a ' grime symphony ' featuring rapper @entity103 , and the @entity6 will include a singalong section inspired by @entity105			0
the series of 92 concerts will also include a tribute to @entity109 , with a performance of pieces referenced in sir @entity113 's books , including compositions by @entity71 and @entity115			2
it is one of a number of sunday matinees on the schedule , which are designed to attract families with children as young as five			0
sir @entity123 will host another of the afternoon concerts , featuring music from his natural history television series @entity128			2
more traditional fare includes the complete @entity72 piano concertos and sir @entity131 conducting @entity133 's @entity132			1
the @entity11 's selection is the latest bizarre choice for the @entity6 ( pictured at @entity17 ) , which has previously been accused of ' dumbing down ' rapper @entity136 ( left ) and pop singer @entity137 ( right ) have played the @entity6 in recent years in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience			1

@entity11 @entity10 will *present* a late night prom at @entity17 this *summer*
bizarre choice may prove *controversial* with more traditional *listeners*
@entity145 1 *present*er 's evening will celebrate club music in @entity8
