a new report , backed by @entity2 mayor @entity1 , may make it easier for @entity3 to work and travel within the @entity5			1
the report , penned by @entity8 's @entity7 , urges the @entity5 government to rethink their immigration laws when it comes to @entity3 and @entity12 , by creating a ' bilateral mobility zone ' between the countries			1
the report encourages a system similar to @entity3 's @entity17 ( @entity18 ) with @entity12 , which allows free movement between both countries			1
@entity12 are given an arrival date when they enter @entity3 but no termination date			2
allowing them to work , live and visit for an indefinite period of time			0
it is hoped that this scheme would dramatically restructure the current @entity5 arrangement , which has seen a drop in @entity3 migrating to the @entity5 from 40,000 in 1999 to 26,000 in 2011			1
the report , ' how to solve a problem like a @entity37 ' , has received @entity1 's seal of approval , who claims the ' @entity5 needs immigration controls and an end to porous borders '			1
in the report , mr @entity1 recalls his trip to @entity3 in 2013 and how it inspired him to be an advocate for new @entity5 visa laws			1
' in 2013 i visited @entity3 and was reminded of the myriad enduring bonds between ' the @entity50 - speaking peoples , ' ' i was also struck by the strength of the @entity3 economy ' the report encourages a system similar to @entity3 's @entity17 ( @entity18 ) with @entity12 , which allows free movement between both countries ' @entity5 are more deeply contacted with @entity3 – culturally and emotionally – than with any other country on earth , ' he said			1
the @entity18 would be a starting point for the @entity5 to build a fair and reasonable regime with @entity3			2
the report quoted an unnamed @entity3 nurse who recently returned home after spending 2 years in @entity2 on the @entity65			2
while she had no intentions of staying in @entity5 long - term before she left @entity3 , the nurse met somebody while she was travelling and she is now left in limbo , wondering how she can return			2
' i did n't have a workplace willing to sponsor me , ' she said			0
' what really upsets me is the fact that i am a nurse			0
anyone can see the @entity5 is in dire need of well - trained @entity77 nurses			0
' i know because i worked alongside many @entity79 nurses that had poor @entity50 skills and whose clinical skills were borderline dangerous , ' she said			0
an @entity3 teacher , who works in the @entity5 , told the report that it is scandalous how many hoops @entity3 citizens have to jump through in order to stay in the @entity5			2
' the amount of processes that @entity3 and @entity12 and other @entity8 citizens have to do just to stay in the @entity5 is absolutely ridiculous			1
something needs to be done , ' she said			0
in the report , @entity1 also states that the same conditions would apply for @entity5 citizens who wanted to work and live in @entity3			1
it is hoped that this scheme would dramatically restructure the current @entity5 arrangement , which has seen a drop in @entity3 migrating to the @entity5 from 40,000 in 1999 to 26,000 in 2011 ' @entity102 would never be seen as alien , ' the report predicted			1
' nor would @entity3 or @entity12 in @entity5			1
the issue may come down to political climates and the resulting political will			0
' the @entity5 , @entity3 , @entity107 and @entity12 share the same head of state , the same language and the same common - law legal system			1
' critically , they are all highly economically developed democracies and there is also a distinct common culture and familial bond between them			0
the report also touches on @entity3 's recent attitude towards immigration , claiming that it would morally be wrong for the @entity3 government to allow @entity5 to work and live in @entity3 and refuse @entity121 nationals			1
' this issue may come down to political climates and the resulting political will , ' the report said			0
for instance , @entity3 's current attitude towards immigration has become quite turbulent in relation to @entity121 asylum - seekers and their branding as ' boat people '			1
' it may be seen as hypocrisy for any @entity3 government to on the one hand allow freedom of work and movement of @entity5 yet on the other refuse entry to nationals from @entity121 countries , ' the report said			1
the @entity8 has a combined population of 2.3bn people in its collection of 53 developed , developing and emerging economies in the report , @entity1 also states that the same conditions would apply for @entity5 citizens who wanted to work and live in @entity3 ' at present the @entity5 underutilises this network and the @entity8 is undermined by an outmoded @entity5 visa regime , ' the report said			1
it goes on to claim that the @entity8 countries matter to the @entity5 because they represent the nation 's past and future legacy			0
yearly immigration by nationality from old @entity8 nations – @entity3 , @entity107 , @entity12 , and @entity157 – peaked at 73,000 in 2004			2
this figure crashed to 29,000 in 2011			0
2012 brought only slight increases in migration from @entity3 in september 2013 , @entity1 , floated the idea of establishing bilateral labour mobility zones between the @entity5 and @entity3			2
in his regular @entity165 column , the mayor highlighted the story of @entity3 school teacher @entity167 , who was forced to return to @entity3 after her visa expired and her school did not renew it			2
' in spite of all her efforts she has been effectively kicked out of @entity5 , ' he said			0
' what is her crime ? that she is n't @entity176			0
nor is she @entity177 , or @entity178 , or @entity179 , or @entity180 , or @entity181 , or @entity182 , ' ' in 1973 we betrayed our relationships with @entity8 countries such as @entity3 and @entity12			0
' it was assumed that in order to be internationalist it was enough to be @entity79			0
well it is perfectly obvious in 2013 that this is no longer enough and we need to seek a wider destiny , ' he said			0
