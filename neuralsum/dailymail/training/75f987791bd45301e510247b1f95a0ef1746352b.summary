a four - year - old real estate advertisement has emerged revealing the use of @entity3 people moving out of the area as a selling point for luxurious apartments			1
the suburb of @entity8 has long been the indigenous heart of @entity11 's inner city but since residential development has started taking over the urban goldmine - a website used the fact that there would be less @entity3 neighbours as a hook for potential buyers			1
the shocking ad has sparked outrage from the indigenous community with many describing it as ‘ sickening ’ , ‘ despicable ' and ‘ straight out racism ’			1
the ad on @entity34 's website , which primarily targets @entity43 buyers , talks about the good rental return and convenient location before attempting to lure keen buyers with the fact that they would n't have @entity3 as neighbours			1
' the aboriginals have already moved out , now @entity8 as the last virgin suburb close to city , it will have great potential for the capital growth in the near future , ' the ad said			2
@entity31 owner @entity56 told @entity57 that he is mortified about the line and he would never have endorsed the advertisement as he prides himself on his company 's relationship with the indigenous community			1
' when our office moved here in 2000 the first thing we did was knock on @entity68 's door at the @entity69 , ' he said			2
' we would never do anything to harm that relationship			2
' mr @entity56 , who has not employed @entity34 for years , said the ad had clearly not been thought through properly			1
' it is not in @entity75 's character to condone that - the ad was simply not expressed correctly but we knew nothing about it until yesterday			1
' the ad for the 18 @entity37 apartments is four years old - the last sale was two and half years ago @entity31 has been appointed by the @entity69 's to construct its @entity83 , a $ 70 million redevelopment of the area known as @entity86 in @entity8			1
the project will include student housing and 62 units of affordable housing earmarked for @entity3 people			0
@entity93 chief executive @entity92 told @entity57 that he finds it hard to believe that @entity75 were unaware of the advertisement			2
' @entity75 will be held to account and not just deflecting it on to say it was someone else ’s problem , ' he said			0
' that ’s more arrogance than anything to claim that they did n’t know			0
' ' we are go gutted as the community rep body for all @entity3 people in the area that this had been in the public domain for so long – it ’s a very deceitful way of doing business in the community			1
' mr @entity92 said he was horrified by the news that he described as ' deplorable ' and ' despicable '			0
' i find that unacceptable that someone would be trying to work with our community at the same time as marketing other opportunities based on our community being moved , ' he said			0
' it 's the most sickening end of trying to work with people in good faith			0
' aboriginal activist , @entity123 , described the ad as ' laughable ' and ' straight out racism ' mr @entity92 is just one of many leaders in the indigneous community expressing outrage about the advertisement			1
long - time @entity3 activist and lawyer , @entity123 , who also lives in @entity8 , described the ad as ' laughable ' and added that this kind of mentality has been around for years			2
' even changing the names from east @entity8 to west @entity8 and that sort of stuff - and the funny thing about it is the postcode remains the same and this was before the gentrification , ' he told @entity57			0
' i do n’t know where these developers get off coming up with that – that ’s just straight out racism - @entity8 is a multi-cultural village - there are people of all colours there ' mr @entity123 insisted that although some @entity3 people have moved out of the area due to the exorbitant rent - the indigenous community was here to stay			1
' @entity8 has been the ideological address for @entity3 people from all over @entity160 and we do n’t intend to move , ' he said			0
' anyone who wants to move to @entity8 , and the surrounding suburbs , is quite welcome but @entity3 people will always be there - so if you do n’t like @entity3 people do n’t move there			0
' ' we are a great mob of people to live with so come and enjoy our company			0
' he also called on @entity8 locals to show leadership and be a shining example			0
' i would like to throw down that challenge to the residents of @entity8 to get rid of those sorts of comments that are out there and become world leaders in race relations			0
' @entity31 , who knew nothing about the ad until tuesday , has been appointed to construct the $ 70 million redevelopment of @entity86 in @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity3 and @entity188 social justice commissioner , @entity187 , told the @entity160 that he was ' sickened ' by the advertising , and he called on the company to meet with @entity3 local community			1
mr @entity192 said he had already spoken to the community to explain his stance on the situation			0
@entity196 , the head of the prime minister ’s @entity197 , told the @entity160 that the suburb 's indigenous history should be ' honoured not trashed ' .			2
