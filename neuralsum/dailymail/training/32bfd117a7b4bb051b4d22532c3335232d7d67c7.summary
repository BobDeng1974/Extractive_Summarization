two other top jockeys have suffered the deaths of 17 and 16 horses respectively over the same period			0
the figures , produced by an animal rights group , fuel claims that horse racing is cruel , and should be restricted			1
fatalities : @entity15 riding @entity16 at the 2012 @entity17 , shortly before their fatal fall @entity19 say that the jockeys ’ death rates are broadly reflective of those across the entire sport , with the top riders having more deaths just because they have more races			1
the figure of 20 was for champion jockey @entity15 , whose mount @entity16 died in last month ’s @entity17			1
in the same race , according to @entity28 also died , leading to a wave of concern about welfare			0
at the time , @entity15 , one of @entity34 ’s most successful jockeys and @entity35 two years ago , said : ‘ it is one of those terrible things you wish would never happen			1
’ he described @entity16 , on which he had won the @entity39 at @entity40 in march , as ‘ a horse i wo n’t ever forget ’			1
last year alone , @entity15 ’s mount @entity44 died in a race at @entity46 in december , a @entity43 died after a race at @entity48 in july , @entity42 also died at @entity48 in january , and @entity49 died after the races at @entity40 on @entity51			1

@entity16 was the 20th mount ridden by @entity15 to die during or after a race since 2007 ‘ they have accumulated the highest death tallies because they ride a lot of races			1

’ jockeys ’ @entity83 spokesman @entity100 said : ‘ leading jockeys will ride far more horses per year than others , so , simply by the law of averages , they are more likely to see some of their mounts suffer fatal injuries			0
