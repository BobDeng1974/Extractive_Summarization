mr @entity25 told the jury : ' not surprisingly there was media interest in what was going on and the defendant voiced his opinions			0

' because of the connections he had , he acted in breach of trust towards the community in which he lived			0
he was arrested on april 19 and since then there have been no further incidents			0

' the prosecution say that the defendant @entity1 was the person responsible for these loud bangs and explosions			1

the court heard that @entity1 had also been reporting his ' concerns ' about explosions to the police			1
but the prosecutor said this was an attempt by the defendant to “ put police off the scent ” and that what he had down amounted to a breach of the community ’s trust in him			0
