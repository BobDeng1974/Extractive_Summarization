a new craze has coffee drinkers blending two tablespoons of butter into their morning brew in the hope of boosting energy levels , losing weight and feeling mentally alert			1
the fad has taken the @entity8 by storm and is now gaining traction in the @entity11 , with big coffee shop chains adding their own versions of the buttery coffee to their menus			1
known as ' fat black ' and ' paleo coffee ' , it was formulated by @entity8 health guru @entity19 who discovered yak butter tea while traversing the @entity22 mountains			1
adding two tablespoons of unsalted butter - made from grass - fed cows - and a dash of coconut oil to morning coffee can provide six hours of energy , burns fat and improves cognitive function , @entity8 health guru @entity19 claims writing on his website , mr @entity19 said : ' i learned about the power of butter at 18,000 feet of elevation near @entity35			1
' i staggered into a guest house from the -10 degree weather and was literally rejuvenated by a creamy cup of yak butter tea			0
' mr @entity19 says the coffee will give you energy for ' six hours if you need it ' , programs the body to ' burn fat for energy all day long ' and ' improves cognitive function '			1
the drink is made from a strict recipe of organic black coffee made from his trademark ' low toxin beans ' , which mr @entity19 claims are ' cleaner ' than regular coffee			1
a dash of medium - chain triglyceride oil – a supplement made from refined coconut oil - is then added			1
this ' improves brain energy ' mr @entity19 says			2
next , two tablespoons of unsalted butter , preferable from grass - fed cows are melted in , and the mixture is whipped up into a froth			0
according to mr @entity19 , butter contains all the benefits of healthy milk fat with none of the damaging proteins found in cream , making for ' the creamiest , most satisfying ' cup of coffee			1
advocates swear they feel mentally alert and top of their game , able to fire on all cylinders			0
the drink is made from a strict recipe of organic black coffee made from his trademark ' low toxin beans ' , which mr @entity19 claims are ' cleaner ' than regular coffee it is used by ' recording artists before they go on stage , world champion athletes , and some of the world ’s top executives ' , mr @entity19 claims			1
but others have described the taste as too rich and oily , leaving them feeling sick and uncomfortable			0
critics argue the underlying science is shaky , and fear bulletproof coffee is one of the greatest marketing cons of the century			1
in fact , a study published in anthropologist journal in 2004 found that @entity22 women who drank large amounts of butter tea stood a greater chance of becoming obese , ' increasing their risk for other health problems '			0
nutritionists also warn those who drink the coffee are replacing their more traditional , nutritious breakfast , with something that is low in essential nutrients			2
and some argue butter is high in saturated fats , which raises the level of cholesterol in your blood and therefore increases your risk of heart disease and stroke			1
apparently the drink is consumed by ' recording artists before they go on stage , world champion athletes , and some of the world ’s top executives ' , mr @entity19 claims however , others say studies have shown saturated fat has been unfairly demonized			1
research published in the @entity8 journal of @entity138 in 2010 found no evidence saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of heart disease			1
and while butter and coffee may sound like an unlikely combination , it has actually been consumed around the world for years			0
aside from the @entity22 mr @entity19 encountered , who do indeed drink yak butter and tea at high altitudes , @entity148 commonly add spiced butter into their coffee			2
and in @entity156 , coffee beans are often stir - fried with butter in a wok before being consumed			0
nutritionist @entity159 says adding butter to coffee is not a recipe for a heart attack - as long as you avoid eating carbohydrates nutritionists and dietitians are divided on whether bulletproof coffee can be incorporated into a healthy diet or not			1
here nutritionist @entity159 argues bulletproof coffee is not a path to a heart attack , while dietitian @entity173 says it goes against all the principles of healthy eating			2
@entity176 : its better to fuel on fat nutritionist @entity159 says it 's healthier to fuel on fat than carbohydrates			0
she said : ' bulletproof coffee is drank by people following what is called a @entity184 diet - @entity184			1
' this is a growing movement world wide of smart people who have worked out that fuelling on fat is much healthier and less fattening than fuelling on carbohydrate			2
' it is a direct rebellion to the @entity191 official dietary advice , which has proved so disastrous for obesity , type 2 diabetes and other chronic illness since the dietary guidelines were introduced in the late 1970s/early 1980s			0
' the key point for those not familiar with @entity184 is that you must do the low carb bit if you 're going to do the high fat			0
' if you have a butter / coconut oil coffee with a slice of toast for breakfast you will highly likely gain weight			1
' people doing @entity184 are invariably consuming 20 - 50g of carb a day - somewhere between a couple of mugs of greens up to 2 bananas a day ( although @entity184 followers wo n't eat bananas - they 'll get their carbs from veg / berries and nuts )			2
' she added : ' personally i would always have eggs / milk / yoghurt for breakfast , simply because these foods are nutritionally far superior to butter / oil			0
' coconut oil provides a bit of vitamins e and @entity227 and nothing else of value			2
' butter is good for the fat soluble vitamins , but not much else			0
' eggs are a fantastic already for most vitamins and minerals			0
' @entity235 : go for a skinny latte instead @entity237 said : ' the idea of adding saturated fat to coffee goes against the principles of healthy eating and long term weight management			2
@entity237 says coffee with semi-skimmed milk instead of fat will give a range of nutrients for long - term health ' such faddy practices that promise speedy weight loss may well help you lose weight fast - but it 's likely to creep back on again , and you may end up heavier than before you started			0
' adding extra fat to coffee means adding extra calories - the idea of opting for a skinny latte makes good sense , whereas adding the recommended amount of fat and butter to your coffee could set you back around 3 - 400kcal			2
' it will probably fill you up more than a regular coffee , but having it for breakfast means there 's less room for healthy breakfast foods that give you fibre and micronutrients			0
' my advice would be to go for foolproof coffee - quality coffee made with semi-skimmed milk as part of a balanced whole grain breakfast			0
' ' it will fill you up , energise you , help keep your blood glucose levels steady , and give you a range of nutrients to keep you healthy in the long term			0
