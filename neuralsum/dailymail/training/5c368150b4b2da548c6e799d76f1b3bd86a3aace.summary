by @entity1 reporter published : 19:50 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 15 november 2012 a man narrowly avoided an abduction arrest after he picked up the wrong little girl at school and drove away with her			1
@entity6 was supposed to pick up six - year - old @entity7 yesterday at her @entity8 , @entity10 school as a favor to her mother			0
instead , he drove away with nine - year - old @entity13 -- and almost wound up in jail			0
@entity13 vaguely resembled the little girl he was supposed to bring home , @entity6 said , and since she answered to the name @entity18 , he assumed it was her			1
@entity13 , 9 , ( left ) was supposed to go home with her mother 's friend while @entity7 , 6 ( right ) was supposed to go home with @entity6 after school			2
@entity6 took the wrong girl home and nearly got arrested			1
' i told her i was looking for @entity18 , ' @entity6 told @entity25			1
' and the young girl said her name was @entity18			1
' @entity13 , who was also expecting one of her mother 's friends to bring her home that day , climbed into @entity6 's car			2
' i got off the bus and he pulled up and he asked if there was a @entity18 , ' she told @entity36 10			1
' i said , ' yeah			0
' my crossing guard let me go and i went with him			0
' the two of them drove away , with @entity6 unaware that @entity7 , who he was supposed to pick up , was still patiently waiting for him			0
@entity6 had n't seen her in several weeks and she 'd recently gotten a haircut , so he did n't recognize her			0
@entity6 did n't realize he had the wrong @entity18 until they 'd driven several blocks			1
@entity6 got the scare of his life when he picked up the wrong girl after school			1
but he knew he 'd made a terrible mistake when he asked her about a recent family vacation			2
@entity18 said she had no idea what he was talking about			1
' he was like , " you were n't with @entity54 in @entity55 ? " no , i would never have been in @entity55 , ' @entity18 said			1
@entity6 stopped the car and told @entity18 they were going back straight away			1
' i know @entity18 was in @entity55 for two weeks , ' said @entity6			2
' i had to turn around and take her back			0
i got the wrong @entity18			1
' but police , alerted by the sharp - eyed crossing guard who saw @entity18 climb into an unfamiliar car , were already on the prowl for him			1
the crossing guard had even jotted down his license plate number to give to police			0
police pulled @entity6 over in his car and nearly arrested him for abduction			2
but after asking him and @entity18 several questions , it became clear it was a simple mix - up			2
meanwhile , the friend who was supposed to pick up @entity13 was waiting at the bust stop and unable to find the little girl			0
she called @entity18 's mother , who had a few moments of panic before learning her daughter was alright			1
' my girlfriend called me and said , " where 's @entity18 ? '' said @entity13 's mother , @entity83			1
' i said , " well she 's supposed to be at the bus stop waiting for you			0
" she said , " she 's not here			0
'' ' both @entity7 and @entity13 were reunited with their mothers after police untangled the comedy of errors			0
although the situation ended happily , there was also a lesson learned for the girls			0
' do n't go in someone 's car when you do n't know ' em , ' said @entity13			0
as for @entity6 , he says he 'll have no problem recognizing the right @entity18 in future			2
' i wo n't forget , ' he said			0
' i 'll take a picture			0
