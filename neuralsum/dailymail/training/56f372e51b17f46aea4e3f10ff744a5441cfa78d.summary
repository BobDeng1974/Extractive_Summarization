' @entity0 , making his first appearance since completing a £ 16milllion move from @entity77 last week , could not be faulted for his attitude in an encouraging afternoon 's work , but he missed three super chances			1
you could see his team ethic - he was pressing , working for us as much as he could			2

decisive : @entity134 said that @entity8 were unlucky at key moments , such as @entity142 's ' soft ' penalty ' in the beginning after some mistakes we conceded the first goal , but we competed very well in that first half			1
we created a chance , a one against one with the keeper			0
' then in the second half we conceded a very soft penalty at a key moment in the game			0
' and at 2 - 0 down we tried , but we tried but were unlucky			1
i 'm disappointed with the result			0
' @entity4 waltzed past four @entity8 players and then scuffed his shot to keeper @entity40 , leaving the @entity1 star on the receiving end of that classic quote above from his own manager			1
