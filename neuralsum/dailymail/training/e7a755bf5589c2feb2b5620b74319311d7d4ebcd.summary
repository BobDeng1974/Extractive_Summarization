by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 06:41 est , 19 october 2012 it is a phrase you would not associate with one of the holiest men alive			2
indeed , it must have caused the stenographer a little consternation when the @entity8 apparently finished his speech with a very frank ' f * * * it ' to an audience of students at @entity13 in @entity14			1
still , the stenographer had to transcribe what he heard - or thought he had heard - and flashed the phrase up on the closed caption video screens			2
so those relying on the screens for dialogue heard his holiness finish his message of peace by telling them them they could do the unspeakable			2
embarrassingly , the his holiness was just being polite , telling the audience that if they did not agree with his views on world peace , they could just ... forget			0
blooper ! the @entity8 's phrasing got lost in transcription as he delivered a world peace lecture on @entity34 on wednesday at the @entity35 the @entity8 , delivering the memorial lecture at @entity13 on wednesday , called on the audience to create a peaceful society through dialogue			1
5,600 people were inside the @entity41 in @entity42 , although it is not known how many of them thought they heard what the stenographer heard			0
the offending phrase came towards the send of the speech , when the 77 - year - old said : ' if you feel these points are not much relevant - not much interest - then forget			1
' but the now presumably - blushing stenographer had to go with his first instinct , and the exact phrase he wrote on the screens in the hall was ' f --- it '			0
' apologies for any confusion ' : the @entity8 , sporting a @entity13 cap , blesses the crowd during his speech			1
the university later clarified his remarks this is not the first time the @entity8 has been heard not swearing			1
the @entity66 recounts the occasion he told a crowd in @entity69 , @entity70 , how we ' should forget about our religious differences ' - causing similar confusion			0
this time , @entity13 clarified the situation , telling the @entity66 : ' @entity8 's last word of the day , verified by his personal translator , was " forget "			1
another clip on @entity78 also shows the esteemed holy man telling a crowd : ' we should forget about our religious differences			0
and also forget , and forget			0
' he then looked up at the laughing audience , and asked them : ' what did i do ? ' ...			0

unlikely ' swearing ' came at the very end of a speech at @entity13 on @entity90
