by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 24 january 2013 a 64 - year - old car dealer nicknamed ' @entity2 ' by workmates and subjected to jibes from colleagues about his age has won an unfair dismissal case			1
workers at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , changed @entity14 's car numberplate from @entity15 to @entity16 and asked when his 65th birthday - and expected retirement - was , an employment tribunal heard			1
mr @entity0 was service team leader at the dealership and claimed that bosses wanted to replace him with a younger employee when he retired			1
strikes back : @entity14 , who was nicknamed @entity2 after the @entity23 character , pictured right the tribunal was told that principal dealer @entity25 frequently reminded mr @entity0 of his age and once introduced him as ' my 104 - year - old service team leader '			1
he told mr @entity14 that he had checked personnel records to find out when his 65th birthday was and asked him to swap jobs with @entity31 , a younger member of staff being groomed to replace mr @entity0 in his higher paid role			1
mr @entity0 was dubbed ' @entity2 ' by staff after the @entity23 character - which the @entity36 tribunal explained was ' a small , wizened character who is several hundred years old '			0
he stayed put in his job - but when a round of redundancies came up he was given the axe in february last year , after being put into a ' pool of one '			1
he won his claim of unfair dismissal on the grounds of age discrimination			0
the tribunal was told how mr @entity25 had ' a tendency to express himself in a way which suggests that he does not consider carefully when and how it is appropriate to make references to the protected characteristics of employees and others in the workplace '			0
employer : mr @entity0 was employed at the @entity10 dealership in @entity11 , @entity12 the tribunal said in its ruling : ' the respondent tolerated the playing of work related pranks and the use of age - related nicknames in its workplace			1
' for example , on one occasion an employee of the respondent changed the letters of the claimant 's number plate from @entity15 to @entity16 , although the tribunal accepts that the claimant found this to be humorous rather than offensive			0
' further , a number of the respondent 's employees referred to the claimant as " @entity2 " , a small , wizened character in @entity23 who is several hundred years old			0
' mr @entity25 denied describing mr @entity0 as his ' 104 - year - old service team leader ' , but the tribunal found that it was the type of remark he might make			0
he was disciplined for an offensive email in july 2011 telling staff not to move cars from one dealership to another without a deposit being left , and the tribunal found it was evidence of his managerial style , which he also applied to mr @entity0 's age			2
the tribunal said in its ruling : ' mr @entity25 commented that he could see no problem with age - related banter " if everyone is getting on "			2
' he went on to say that such banter was not the same as " discrimination about the colour of someone 's skin "			0
' whilst it is obviously the case that it is not necessary for employees to avoid all light - hearted references to the protected characteristics of other employees , the way in which mr @entity25 expressed himself left the tribunal to find that he did not regard age - related banter as being something which some employees might find offensive			2
' it ruled that because mr @entity0 had been made redundant while no consideration was given to making mr @entity31 redundant instead he had been discriminated against .			0

@entity14 was subjected to *taunts* about his age by colleagues
bosses at @entity10 wanted to replace him with someone younger
he was put on a ' *shortlist* of one ' when redundancies came around
a tribunal ruled that he was discriminated against because of his age
