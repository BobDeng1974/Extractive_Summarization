@entity0 believes @entity2 ’s loan spell at @entity3 has been so successful that he is now ready to challenge for a place at @entity5 next season			1
such an outcome would obviously deny @entity9 ’s stated aim of retaining the young @entity10 for another year , yet @entity0 also sees a clear positive			1
to the former @entity3 captain , @entity2 ’s development can act as a perfect advert to encourage more emerging talents to take their next career step at @entity16			1
young defender @entity2 ( left ) has impressed on loan at @entity3 this season the 19 - year - old recently won his first international cap for @entity20 in a @entity22 qualifier against @entity23 the 19 - year - old earned a first full cap for his country when he came off the bench in their 1 - 0 win in @entity30 on tuesday night following a red card for @entity32			1
@entity2 will hope to join @entity33 in @entity5 ’s first - team squad when he returns to his parent club this summer and @entity0 feels he is equipped to take that step			1
‘ @entity2 certainly looks like he could go back to @entity5 and make an impression , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ for a young boy , he ’s been exceptional			2
he looks a lot older in his play and it surprises you when you remind yourself how young he actually is			0
‘ the only question is whether he will get the opportunities he wants down there			0
i think he will , especially now that he is featuring for @entity20 in a qualification game			0
‘ unfortunately , @entity3 ca n’t compete with the money on offer in @entity50			1
the new television deal down there has taken things to another level again			0
‘ i ’d love @entity2 to stay at @entity3 for 10 years but that ’s not going to happen			1
he ’s an ambitious boy and wants to go and challenge himself to be the best he can			0
from some of the games i ’ve seen , i think he could slot into that @entity5 defence no problem			1
@entity2 has been tipped to partner @entity20 team - mate @entity32 ( left ) on his return to @entity5 @entity2 has formed a successful partnership with @entity63 @entity62 ( left ) at @entity16 ‘ however , hopefully his success will help @entity3 bring more youngsters in			1
previously people said you move to @entity50 to get international caps			0
@entity2 and @entity69 showed that ’s not the case			2
‘ @entity3 can say , “ come here and you will progress ” and use those examples to attract players			2
’ @entity75 revealed earlier this week that @entity77 captain @entity76 is one central defensive candidate under consideration by @entity3 as they look a potential additions for next term			1
‘ good players attract attention and @entity76 has been playing very well for @entity77 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he is certainly someone who was very promising as a young boy and is hopefully getting back to that level			0
’ the current partnership between @entity2 and @entity62 has formed the foundation of @entity3 ’s bid for the @entity88 – a feat the club last achieved in 2001 when @entity0 was skipper			1
manager @entity9 should be able to attract rising youngsters to the @entity92 , claims @entity0 @entity3 are considering a bid for @entity77 defender @entity76 to shore up their defence while some will point to the absence of a competitive @entity99 from the top - flight , the @entity96 international is adamant a domestic clean sweep this term would be the equal of his achievement under @entity105 ’s management			1
‘ a treble this year would stand beside the other three in @entity3 ’s history , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you have to beat what is in front of you			0
‘ there have only been three in @entity3 ’s history and that tells you how hard it is to achieve it			2
‘ if they do get the @entity88 , there should be the same adulation as when my team won it in 2001 and @entity122 ’s team did it twice			0
‘ it would be a fantastic achievement if @entity125 was collecting the @entity126 to complete a @entity88			0
‘ @entity127 has been a challenge with @entity129 doing so well , although i think the pressure will eventually tell			0
‘ you ca n’t take away what @entity3 have achieved so far and sometimes the difficult part of the @entity88 is winning the cups			2
‘ @entity3 have had a terrible record in the @entity136 over the years and that shows how hard it is			2
‘ i ’d like to see the talking done when they have two in the bag and are preparing for the @entity126 final			0
‘ @entity9 ’s approach is new			2
he ’s spoken about the @entity88 from the start but it does show the level of confidence he has			0
’ former captain @entity0 insists a treble for @entity3 this season will equal his own three - way success from 2001 @entity0 was speaking at @entity150 as he launched the search for nominees to be inducted into the @entity153			1
the 49 - year - old has a very decent claim himself , but would be delighted if figures who operated behind the scenes were recognised			0
‘ professor ( stewart ) hillis , who passed away last year , and other @entity161 backroom guys who maybe are n’t as well - known would be very deserving of being in there			0
‘ @entity163 is another one who contributed a lot with @entity3 and the national team - and i think that would be a great gesture if they were inducted			2
’ fans can make nominations by logging on to sfmhalloffame.co.uk			0
