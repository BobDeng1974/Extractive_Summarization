@entity0 knows his success at @entity2 will be gauged on silverware			1
on his ability to deliver @entity6 football and domestic dominance on an annual , undisturbed , basis			2
and yet for this educated , single - minded @entity10 , the cups and trophies are not his prime motivation			1
they are not his raison d’etre			2
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 supporters may feel differently , but for @entity0 it ’s about the experiences			1
here is an idealist who wants to manage @entity2 in @entity25 and feel goosebumps on his arms			1
new challenge : @entity0 is looking ahead to a new challenge with @entity31 giants @entity2 vision : @entity0 wants @entity2 to make a mark on @entity35 football playing the right way ‘ my dream with @entity2 is to go to @entity38 for a @entity6 match , play a really big @entity35 team and control the game			1
i want to have more passes than the opposition and really just blow them away			2
that ’s my dream , ’ he said			2
‘ for me , it is about moments			2
trophies are important , but i do n’t remember the trophies i won in @entity10			2
‘ i remember the moments - driving to the stadium , seeing the people happy			2
playing fantastic football to win the game and the young kids are smiling - i get goosebumps from that			2
‘ when i came to watch @entity2 play @entity56 at home last season , it was unbelievable			1
think what it would be like if @entity2 could also control the game ? that would be awesome , fantastic - and that ’s my dream			1
’ all of this is well and good			0
but the truth is this			0
@entity0 will only hang around to sample these moments as a @entity2 manager if he wins games			1
if he consistently delivers trophies and @entity6 qualification			0
he takes a major step towards that goal in @entity70 this evening			0
@entity2 arrived in @entity71 , the country ’s capital city , to soaring temperatures of 31 degrees centigrade			1
the tar may not be melting on the streets , but a certain degree of expectation is bubbling under the surface here			0
excited : @entity0 is relishing the opportunity to take @entity2 to the next level all ears : @entity2 players listen to a team talk from @entity0 during a pre-season friendly @entity86 ’s champions are marginal favourites			1
yet @entity87 fancy their chances of an upset			0
even if no @entity70 team has competed in the @entity6 group stage for 17 years			0
in this old city , they speak freely of @entity2 being weaker than they used to be			1
former @entity38 striker @entity95 claims his old team are nowhere near the calibre of line - up he performed in under @entity99			2
there ca n’t be many who recall @entity102 or @entity103 being world beaters , but @entity105 has given rise to a common view in @entity70			0
under @entity108 , @entity87 are no great shakes themselves			0
but their confidence is pinned on a growing conviction that the same might be said of @entity2			1
‘ we are meeting a team who could fight for playing in the @entity6 group stages , ’ acknowledged @entity0			1
‘ they have a goal to do this and they are capable			0
‘ i think we are going to have two very close games and small details are going to prove the difference , as it did last year for @entity2 and the year before			1
they had some very close matches			0
’ @entity0 , a coach with precious little real experience at this level , declared himself ‘ comfortable ’ with his team ’s chances			1
yet there are plenty of observers – and they are not all @entity70 - who suspect that this @entity2 team lack the depth and quality to reach the group stages for a third successive year			1
@entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 have gone , while captain @entity141 is injured			0
@entity142 and @entity143 have not departerd yet , but the only new faces are @entity145 - a goalkeeper who has n’t played a competitive game for two years - and @entity147 , a @entity149 loan signing who has barely kicked a ball in six months			2
unfazed , however , @entity0 said : ‘ i have seen my players for a month now and i ’ve seen the quality in the squad			1
so , if we can manage to get the best out of them for this match then i know we have a very good chance to beat @entity87			0
confident : @entity0 will back himself to do well in the @entity38 hotseat ‘ of course we want a good result here and if we win then it ’s a good result			1
but it ’s not easy to win away from home and i know at their own ground they will attack us very hard			0
‘ the players have to prepare , have to know what they are going to meet and how we ’re going to go into the game			0
‘ if we do that well , i see in the squad we have a lot of good football players			0
’ on the persistent suggestions from current and former @entity87 players that @entity2 are no longer the team they were at this level , @entity0 is dismissive			1
‘ maybe there is a bit of disrespect			0
but they can say a lot of things , ’ he said			0
‘ i think how we are feeling is much more important than how the others are thinking			0
’ the arrival of attacker @entity147 strengthens @entity0 ’s options			1
yet it ’s hard to see how the new man can be fit or sharp enough to make a positive contribution to a team in need of first - choice , quality signings			1
as he must , @entity147 believes he can make a positive difference to the squad and claims he can play some role against @entity87 and his former @entity199 coach @entity108			0
‘ i ’m not expecting to go right in and start , ’ said the 23 - year - old @entity10 international , ‘ but if i get the chance then i can tell the coach that i ’m ready and i ’m going to take it			1
‘ it ’s not bad to maybe get a debut in the @entity6 qualification , so i hope i can make a contribution			0
competitive : @entity0 wants to make @entity2 a force to be reckoned with in @entity25 ‘ i am match fit			1
i have n’t played many first - team games for @entity149 , but many for the second team and i played three or four national games during that time			2
i also played pre-season , so i feel fit			0
’ @entity0 knows @entity147 well after taking him on loan from @entity217 for 18 months while coach of @entity219			1
neither is @entity87 coach @entity108 a stranger to his abilities			0
‘ @entity108 was my coach at @entity199 and we were together for some years , ’ explained @entity147			0
‘ when i first started up at 15 he was my first coach and introduced me to senior football			0
‘ he played a big part in my development so it will be fun with the two coaches involved tomorrow night			0
‘ playing under @entity0 was kind of where i made my breakthrough			1
i owe him a lot - and i hope i can repay him here			2

while he knows he will be judged on his trophy haul at @entity2 the new man *'s* dream is to control @entity35 opposition and *entertain* the *crowd*
@entity0 *replaces* @entity238 who left at the end of last season
the 38 - year - old has *previously* managed @entity243 and @entity219
