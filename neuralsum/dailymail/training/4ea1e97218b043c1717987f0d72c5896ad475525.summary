by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 13:35 est , 14 may 2012 media demands : lord @entity2 told the @entity4 inquiry today that @entity6 's links with the media were ' too close ' while in opposition @entity6 became too close to the media while he was in opposition , former cabinet secretary @entity2 said today			1
lord @entity2 - who retired as head of the civil service at the end of last year - said he tried to ensure ministers maintained a distance from the press			1
but , giving evidence to the @entity17 into press standards , he admitted that he had not always been successful			1
' i think the prime minister himself , the current prime minister , has said that he felt his relationships had got too close , and i agree with that			2
' mr @entity6 admitted last july that he and other politicians had allowed themselves to get ' too close ' to media proprietors and editors , and he has since said that relations were ' too cosy '			1
however , he has stressed that his contacts were not only with @entity30 's @entity29 , but with a wide range of media organisations			0
lord @entity2 also said today that @entity33 should have declared a £ 40,000 shareholding in @entity35 when being vetted so he could have unsupervised access to top secret material			1
in his evidence , lord @entity2 said that while in opposition parties should have a different relationship with journalists than government ministers			1
he said : ' you have much fewer resources , so you do not have big press offices and the like , so you do tend to make closer personal relationships with journalists			0
' there tends to have been swapping of mobile phone numbers , all of those sorts of things			0
' every single secretary of state is subject to collective responsibilities much more important in government than we see in opposition			2
we have to be much more careful , ' he said			0
he added that a lot of special advisers come from a media or pr background			2
the peer said that the inquiry had an opportunity to issue guidelines specifically for opposition parties on their relationships with the press			0
' i think you would want to put it to the leaders of all the parties , " here is a set of rules that we think opposition parties should abide by " , he said			0
lord @entity2 said he had suggested to @entity6 that all meetings between ministers and newspaper editors and owners should be recorded in a transparency drive			1
however , he said it would not be right to record all discussions between mps and journalists because they are part of the ' basic lifeblood ' of parliamentary life			0
he said editors ' are different because of the ability to very strongly support different political parties			2
' @entity35 shares : @entity33 told the @entity4 inquiry he held £ 40,000 worth of shares while he was mr @entity6 's press secretary in @entity104 - and did n't realise the potential conflict of interest until afterwards the former head of the civil service also said that @entity33 should have revealed his @entity35 shareholding			1
mr @entity33 admitted to the inquiry on friday that he held £ 40,000 worth of shares while he was mr @entity6 's press secretary in @entity104			1
he said he only realised the potential conflict of interest after he left @entity113			1
he said in his witness statement : ' i was never asked about any share or stock holdings and because i knew that i was n't involved in any commercial issues , including the @entity121 bid , it never occurred to me that there could be a conflict of interest			0
' in retrospect i wish i had paid more attention to it			0
' however , lord @entity2 said mr @entity33 was asked to sign a form declaring any outside interests when he entered @entity113 but the shareholding was not disclosed - although it should have been			1
a decision was taken to vet him so he could have unrestricted access to secret materials after the airline bomb plot when printer cartridges packed with explosives were found on planes			1
lord @entity2 said mr @entity33 needed more access to top secret documents			1
the press secretary already had undergone a full security check giving him substantial access to secret materials and supervised access to top secret materials			1
questions have been raised about why mr @entity33 was cleared only to @entity149 level ' security checked ' in @entity104 , rather than the tougher dv or ' developed vetting ' level			1
@entity154 's former spin doctor @entity153 was given the higher level of security clearance when he was in @entity113			1
lord @entity2 said he had been keen to keep the numbers of people given the highest vetting to a minimum , to help avoid leaks			1
he added that he did n't know whether other former press secretaries had been cleared to @entity151 level			0
the ex-news of the @entity166 editor resigned before the process was complete			0
he also pointed out that @entity151 was designed to establish ' whether you are blackmailable ... in terms of your position or your personal life '			0
' it would not have gone into enormous detail about phone hacking , for example , ' lord @entity2 said			1
exit : @entity178 's special adviser @entity177 who resigned last month after admitting that the contacts over the @entity121 bid had become too close lord @entity2 said that @entity178 's aide @entity177 should have dealt with the @entity121 fairly			1
mr @entity177 resigned last month after admitting that the contacts over the @entity121 bid had become too close			1
@entity181 has been demanding that mr @entity178 quit for allowing the situation to get out of control			1
lord @entity2 said it was for ministers to authorise their special advisers ' activities , but there was not likely to be a written record of instructions			1
' i would have expected the minister to be clear about what his special adviser should be doing , ' he said			1
he insisted that ' keeping all parties informed about process is perfectly reasonable , but not getting into substance '			0
he added that reviewing the bid was a ' quasi-judicial procedure ' and there was an obligation to deal with it fairly			0
lord @entity2 said he was right to tell @entity202 not to launch an inquiry into media standards in the weeks before the general election			1
he said that if a probe was launched it should have been done with all - party agreement - which would have been difficult in march 2010			0
' there were stories that there was more information out there and i think there was still a question mark as to whether more would emerge ... ' on the basis of what we knew then i would stick with that recommendation			0
' asked whether he had been unwilling to pick up a ' hot potato ' , the peer replied : ' i would say it was clearly a big potato			0
the timing was not ideal			0
' if you are going to do this it would be good to have all - party agreement			0
trying to broker such a thing in the weeks leading up to a general election would be quite difficult			0
' ' forgetful ' : @entity30 was accused of ' selective amnesia ' over a key 1981 meeting as he bought @entity236 @entity29 hit out today at ' fantasy ' allegations made about @entity30 's ' sinister ' back - room dealings with politicians			2
@entity241 , counsel for the @entity17 , was accused of ' headline grabbing ' by suggesting the media mogul was suffering ' selective amnesia ' about his discussions with @entity245			0
the idea that the pair had made an implicit pact over lunch in 1981 to allow his purchase of the @entity236 was a ' science fiction theory ' , according to the company 's barrister @entity252			0
' this is the stuff of fantasy , ' he told @entity4			0
' deals can not be done through telepathy			0
what are the terms ? what is the duration , what is the quid pro quo ? ' mr @entity264 said the documentary record had no evidence of an explicit or implicit deal to exchange favourable media coverage for favourable treatment			2
mr @entity30 also had no reason to lie about having no recollection of the key lunch at @entity273 , as mr @entity274 suggested last week in ' headline - grabbing style ' , he added			2
' it is against the rules , and for good reason , to raise such an issue after the witness has gone , rather than when he is here to answer for it , but never mind that , ' mr @entity264 said			2
' mr @entity30 has nothing to lie about			2
the documents tell the story			2
' mr @entity264 accused mr @entity274 of suggesting it was ' sinister ' for newspapers such as @entity288 to back politicans they agree with			2
' that is exactly what they are meant to do , and are expected to do , as agents of a free press in a democracy , ' he said			0
' in mr @entity274 's hands , the characteristics of a large readership , floating voters , an absence of immutable party loyalties , begin to sound sinister			2
