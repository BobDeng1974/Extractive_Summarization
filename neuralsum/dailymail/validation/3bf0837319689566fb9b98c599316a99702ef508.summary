june @entity9 , 56 ( left ) , has been jailed for 16 years after admitting killing partner of ten years @entity11 , 54 , then posing as him on @entity3 before trying to steal his money today @entity9 was jailed for 16 years after admitting manslaughter , with mrs justice @entity29 telling her : ' you lied so much and so continually that it is difficult to separate the truth from the fiction			1
' mr @entity11 had been in a long - term relationship with @entity9 , but the court heard that it was sexually abusive , and that mr @entity11 had often forced her into prostitution			1
mr @entity11 was a car salesman by trade , but often had little to live on , staying in friends ' houses and caravans , often without heating or running water			1
but in 2009 he was awarded 150,000 euros compensation by a court after he was found to have been abused in a care home in @entity46 , @entity47			0
the court heard that mr @entity11 had used the money to buy a caravan and two cars , and had planned to use the money to move to @entity17 and open a bar			1
however , three days before he died mr @entity11 got into an argument with @entity9 after she refused to move abroad , and accused him of keeping the money from her			1
the court was told he flew into a rage after she refused to have sex with him and stormed off			0
three days later , on @entity62 2010 , @entity9 and her son , @entity61 , beat mr @entity11 over the head with two pieces of wood , before rolling his body up in a carpet , the court heard			1
it is not known exactly what became of the body , but @entity9 is reported to have told friends that mr @entity61 cut the corpse into pieces before burning it on a bonfire			2
however , @entity9 has refused to tell police what happened and the @entity78 said that there was not enough evidence to charge mr @entity61 with disposing of the body			2
after mr @entity11 disappeared @entity9 began posting status updates on his @entity3 page pretending to be him , and claiming he was still alive			1
she falsely suggested he had run off with a younger woman in @entity17 and did n’t want to contact his family because he thought they were after his money			2
@entity9 killed mr @entity11 at this house in @entity88 on @entity62 in 2010 after a row			1

' @entity9 then tried to get access to mr @entity11 's money , which she believed was being stored in a @entity100 bank account that she had access to			1
but unbeknownst to her , the cash was actually being stored in a separate account in @entity47 , leaving her with little more than access to mr @entity11 's benefits money			1
over the next few months she took £ 800 from mr @entity11 , including £ 400 taken from his body , but was unable to get her hands on the larger haul			1
in desperation she persuaded another man to go to @entity47 and pose as mr @entity11 , saying he had lost his debit card , in order to access the money , but failed			1
@entity114 , prosecuting , said : ' her main aim was to get access to the many thousands of @entity117 or pounds of the compensation money			0
fortunately she was unable to do so			0
' in the meantime , police began investigating my @entity11 's disappearance after his family became concerned when they were unable to contact him abroad			2
investigators eventually contacted @entity9 's friend @entity126 , with whom she lived , and @entity127 , who said she had confessed to the killing			2
mr @entity126 told officers : ' she said : " we just gave him the one , two , three			0
we banged him with a baseball bat and he ’s been put on a bonfire			0
” ' miss @entity127 added : ' she told me : “ all men are bastards			0
he was a hard bastard to get down but @entity61 and i got him down			0
” “ he ’s cut up and in bits in bins			0
no - one will ever find him			0
he ’s in bins , burned and cut up			0
” ' officers first interviewed @entity9 in 2013 , but she kept up her charade for another two years before finally admitting what she had done			2
officers have spent more than £ 1million in trying to unravel the case and nearly 100 police officers have been involved in the @entity100 , @entity47 and @entity17			2
@entity149 , mr @entity11 ’s sister , said : ' five years of not knowing what has happened to him and the whereabouts of his body have been mental torture to the family			1
@entity22 @entity21 was told that @entity9 tried to access 150,000 euros ( £ 110,000 ) that mr @entity11 was paid in compensation after being abused in a care home as a child , but was unable to get her hands on it ' not being able to bury @entity160 has been indescribable			1
' mr @entity11 's daughter @entity161 added : ' the people who did this were meant to care for him			2
it is heartless and cruel that they knew we would never see him again			0
' @entity167 , defending , said the couple ’s relationship had been marred by domestic violence and mr @entity11 had forced his partner to work as a prostitute since he came out of prison			1
' over a period of years he effectively used to pimp her out , ' he said			0
' it is an important contextualising matter			0
when the incident did happen she lost control			0
' he went on : ' it was something which occurred on the spur of the moment			0
it was not pre-meditated , she delievered a single blow			0
' the court also heard that mr @entity11 , who had a long history of offending , was himself convicted of manslaughter after stabbing his own son , @entity192 , 19 , in 1999			1
@entity192 died after the pair got into a ' tussle ' in a caravan in @entity196			0
mr @entity11 previously described how he watched his son die in his arms			2
he went on the run but was eventually caught sentenced to seven years at @entity200 in 2004			0
the term was reduced on appeal and he was released the following year because of the time he had already served on remand			0
@entity9 was said to have stood by him when he came out and they moved to the @entity100 and were staying with family in @entity206 when @entity11 lost his life .			2
