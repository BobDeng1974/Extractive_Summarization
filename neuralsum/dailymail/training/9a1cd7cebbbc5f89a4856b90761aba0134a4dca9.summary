@entity0 gave a prickly reaction to questions about his relationship with @entity5 compatriot @entity4 ahead of @entity7 's trip to @entity8 on monday			1
the two men have barely spoken since @entity10 left his job as @entity13 's director of football 10 years ago claiming that he had been undermined by @entity4 who was coach at the time			1
@entity10 was reluctant to talk about @entity4 on friday and was grudging in his praise of what the new @entity8 boss has achieved at @entity19 's this season , guiding his team to third place – one above @entity7 – after losing a number of key players in the summer			1
' we play against @entity8 and we have to speak about them and not the trainer - coach			2
' i 've read that ( how many players @entity8 lost ) but do you know how many players we lost ? i 've never read that in the media			0
we have lost more players			0
' @entity4 is a very good coach and i know that he can do that but it 's also surprising me that a club like @entity8 is in that position but that is always a matter of coach , players and staff			1
when you do that , it 's very good			0
' @entity8 are able to come in the first four but that 's also because i believe in the management of @entity4 and his brother			2
when the cohesion is good he can manage			0
' asked about @entity7 having to pay more for players than @entity8 , @entity10 added : ' i do n't think money is the question			2
when @entity7 are coming , clubs ask for more money and then we have to pay because we 're @entity7			0
' do you think @entity8 paid so much for the players ? no i do n't think so because they are @entity8 and not @entity7			2
' there is always a relationship between @entity65 and @entity7 and teams like @entity67 and @entity8			1
' @entity10 , seen here with @entity4 at @entity69 , claimed the @entity8 boss had undermined him @entity10 shares a joke with his players during @entity7 's training session on friday @entity10 signed @entity74 from @entity8 last summer and were also linked with a move for @entity76 , who eventually joined @entity77 in a £ 25million deal			1
' they have a very good squad , ' said the @entity5			0
' i know a lot of players and a lot of players were offered to us			0
