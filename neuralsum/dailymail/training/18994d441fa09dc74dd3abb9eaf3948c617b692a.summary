by @entity0 this spring - heeled impala must be thankful for his sharp reflexes after he leapt high into the air to narrowly avoid the snapping jaws of a hungry crocodile			1
the predator 's desperate lunge sent the animal high - jumping into the air , startling the yellow - billed oxpeckers that were resting on his back			1
although it was a lucky escape for the impala , one ca n't help but feel pity for the crocodile - a specimen whose clumsy attempts to find a meal are a source of mirth to local guides			1
leap : a spring - heeled impala jumps into the air to avoid the snapping jaws of this hungry crocodile in @entity25 that 's some altitude : the impala continues its impressive leap as his fellows decide they had better flee too airtime : even before the startled impala has landed from his leap , his pals have made good their escape where 's everybody gone ? the hungry crocodile , it turns out , is well known to local guides for being ' useless ' the crocodile had arrived slowly , gliding across the surface of the still water , before hiding beneath at the very edge of the river bank , where it was spotted by a steely - eyed elephant			1
the protective pachyderm saw that the crocodile had moved itself into an attack position and unsuccessfully tried to shepherd the impala away from the riverside - even at one point trying to stamp on the submerged predator			2
but the impala failed to heed the elephant 's warning and their protector eventually lost patience and drifted away - leaving the crocodile free to make his move			2
the dramatic images of his attack were captured by @entity68 - based amateur photographer @entity67 , 64 , at the @entity69 in @entity25 , where he was on safari with wife @entity72			1
three elephants drinking water together shortly before the abortive attack : a protective pachyderm had tried to warn the impalas and even give the crocodile a good kick before they eventually lost interest mr @entity67 said : ' even though i knew it was there , the expectation was tremendous as neither @entity72 nor myself have ever seen a croc attack and certainly not from the four metres or so we were away from this one			2
' our guides were familiar with this croc and had very little regard for its ability , describing it as " useless "			0
nonetheless i was holding my breath for longer than was healthy			0
' the scene was played out on the banks of the @entity96 which , at the very end of the dry season , had been reduced to a series of connected but quite shallow pools			1
' rather surprisingly the impala did n't retreat very far from the crocodile after the attack and soon returned to the river bank , ' said mr @entity67			0
' they were however , very nervous and startled themselves with their own reflections for several minutes			0
' as soon as three or four of them had settled down and resumed drinking , the croc once again launched an attack but for some unknown reason this was completely in the wrong direction from where the impala were and served only to confirm the low opinion our guides had of him			0
' all in all i believe it managed five unsuccessful attacks during that day			0
