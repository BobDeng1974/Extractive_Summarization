i remember the sun , the golf course where we were staying and that there was just so much to do			2

there are a few of them now , and all have different styles , from casual to fine dining			1
they are about being back home with friends and family			1
ideal dining companion ? @entity35			1
i 'm just such a huge football fan			0
i can think of a lot of legendary golfers , but i 'd love to have chatted to somebody regarded as the @entity41 in his day			0
i think we 'd have had great banter			0
least favourite ? any golfer in the world after they 've had a bad round			1
what do you never travel without ? headphones and music ; clean underwear and good company			1
favourite hotel ? the @entity57 in @entity58 , where i feel at home			2
i 'm always looked after well , but not in a fussy way or with special treatment			0
and the breakfasts are great ; lots of sausages , bacon and breads from back home			0
hands on the trophy : @entity3 in familiar victorious mode after winning the @entity72 last july favourite place ? it has to be home , really			1
there 's just nowhere i 'm more relaxed			0
i probably have a very romantic view of home , because i 'm not back for more than about six weeks in a year			0
naughtiest thing you 've done on holiday ? as a kid i think i probably did a pee once or twice in a hotel pool			2
top travel tip ? take good music and headphones wherever you go			2
you can escape almost anything ( or anybody ) with great tunes			0
what 's one place you 're keen to see but have n't ? i 've heard so much great stuff about the @entity96 in @entity97 , so it 's definitely on my list			0
i just love the sound of @entity100 and @entity101			0
