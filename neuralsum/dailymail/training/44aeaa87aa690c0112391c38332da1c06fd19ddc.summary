by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 16:17 est , 7 may 2013 a @entity2 mep is demanding that immigrants who come to @entity4 to beg and commit crimes should be guaranteed the right to full state benefits and even be provided with police protection			1
@entity1 , mep for @entity9 , is calling for new laws to protect immigrants from being excluded from social security benefits , under plans currently being put forward by @entity14			1
in a bid to curb so - called benefits tourism , the prime minister has announced plans to curb rights to housing , health care and cash support from those immigrants who arrive in the @entity4 with no job			1
handouts : a @entity4 mep wants immigrants such as these @entity27 gypsies pictured in @entity28 last month , to be granted full rights to social security benefits but in a @entity32 parliament report which calls on the @entity33 to oppose mr @entity14 ’s initiatives , miss @entity1 is demanding unlimited healthcare for immigrants and an overhaul of the social security system to ensure they are provided with sufficient financial support during their stay in the @entity4			1
in particular , she wants the hoards of @entity27 – in particular the women – who illegally harass people on the streets of central @entity9 to ' not be excluded ' from social security benefits as ' undocumented migrants '			1
in a draft report , miss @entity1 claims ' women of ethnic background like @entity27 ' have special needs , which @entity51 will vote on in the coming weeks – long before the end of the year when @entity53 and @entity54 are given full rights of residency in the @entity4			1
the centrepiece of @entity14 ’s reforms is a six - month limit on the right of @entity62 nationals to claim out - of - work benefits , which is coming under increased attack by @entity65 in @entity66 – who will now join forces with @entity1 who also wants mr @entity14 ’s immigration reforms derailed			1
miss @entity1 ’s report , aimed at ‘ vulnerable groups ’ does however include protecting older people in care from also missing out on benefits and proper care – or receiving very low quality care which only extends to ' cleaning and feeding '			1
in it she calls on the @entity33 however to force the government to ' carry out studies and surveys ' to show how poorer immigrants are also being ' affected by austerity measures '			2
clash : @entity9 @entity2 mep @entity1 is opposed to proposals by prime minister @entity14 to curb benefits for immigrants who do not have jobs however , miss @entity1 wants @entity90 and illegal ‘ immigrants ’ to not only receive benefits from the government for often working in illegal rackets , but for them to also to benefit from special protection against any bad feeling from @entity4 citizens who might show their anger against them			1
the @entity99 and former teacher argues in her report for them to be protected legally against ' hate speech , bullying and assault ' as they are often considered ' too much to care for '			0
and she has the support of the powerful @entity33 which recently warned mr @entity14 that its officials would ' scrutinise ' his reforms for fairness			2
yet it has already come under attack from @entity113			0
' the welfare state in this country exists to provide a safety net for hard times and it should be available to those who have paid into it through their taxes ' argues the @entity113 deputy leader , @entity121			0
' our public services are already overstretched and it is irresponsible to allow them to be put under yet more pressure ' he told the @entity128 on line last night			0
they warned that his proposals – including restrictions on housing , health and unemployment support – must comply with @entity62 free movement rules			0
@entity138 mp @entity137 warned the @entity62 to “ show some respect '			0
he insisted that decisions on immigration must be decided by the @entity4 parliament and he promised to ' strengthen ' tests to ensure only those who pay into the system are able to receive handouts			2
sir @entity147 , chairman of pressure group @entity148 @entity4 , said : ' it is surely only fair that everybody should contribute to the welfare system before they can draw benefits			2
' just recently a group of 60 @entity27 gypsies arrived in @entity28 in @entity9 and are currently camping in @entity156 , where police are only able to occasionally check on their passports			0
tourists have been reported as seeing woman squat in open view in the park , as open top tour buses trail past what was once a highlight of the @entity9 sightseeing tour			0
@entity4 is preparing itself for a predicted influx of @entity53 and @entity54 when they are given free access to our jobs market in january			0
@entity148 has warned that 50,000 could arrive in the @entity4 every year for five years from 2014 .			0
