it ’s been another interesting week for us at @entity2 , where we have added @entity3 to the team			1
@entity3 is a fighter i respect enormously and i can reveal some of the big plans i have for him			1
he will be fighting on may 17 in @entity8 and it is my hope to put him out one more time after that before a winter fight with @entity13			1
that fight is huge and , as it stands , i have pencilled in @entity15 in november			2
if they both keep winning , then they have a massive fight to look forward to and ultimately a final eliminator to a crack at the cruiserweight world title			1
obviously their first fight , which @entity3 won , was in @entity15 , @entity13 ’s backyard , but credit to @entity3 who is happy to go there again as it has the most suitable venue			1
we could do @entity8 again , but the venue there holds 5,000 – this fight is bigger than that			2
it is a fight built on animosity and rivalry – there is no pretend table flipping			2
it ’s a genuine domestic grudge match			0
new arrival : @entity3 has joined forces with @entity2 ahead of his cruiserweight debut in may for me , personally , it is great to be working with @entity3			1
for someone so young – 27 – he has already achieved so much in the sport			0
since losing his light - heavyweight world title last year he has taken his time working out what he wants to do in the sport and what is his best way forward			0
he is the kind of guy who needs to get excited about the sport again			0
he wants to feel the buzz , to get exposure and raise his profile and this move has enabled that			0
it is a new journey for him			0
he has come up to cruiserweight and i think that is smart			2
it is an accessible division			0
we have a great relationship with the @entity68 promotion team and they have a huge foothold on the cruiserweight division			2
they have @entity74 world champion @entity73 and @entity75 , the @entity76 champion , on their books so we are in a strong position in terms of making those fights down the line and these talks are already taking place			0
it is interesting for both @entity3 and @entity13 at the moment			1
the way i look at it , as a promoter , is that i have two things i have to deliver for my fighter			0
number one is to plot the best path to a world title and the other is to deliver the fight that is most lucrative for them			2
as it happens , the most lucrative and biggest fight for both @entity3 and @entity13 right now is to fight each other			1
i could deliver either of them a world title fight tomorrow , but there is no rush			2
i am happy for both guys to settle into the division first , have two fights each – i will probably look to get @entity13 out again at the end of june or early july as he hurt his hand in his last fight – and then they can fight each other			1
after that , the winner will go after titles			0
again : @entity3 ( right ) is set to face @entity13 ( left ) in november in a long - awaited remach bitter : the pair have one of the most heated rivalries in boxing having made their dislike of one another clear same result ? @entity3 edged out @entity13 three years ago and is prepared to return to @entity15 at the moment we are still looking at opponents for @entity3 on may 17			1
@entity13 ’s last opponent , @entity124 , was sort of a gatekeeper for the elite of the division - a tough test against a good fighter			1
we will be looking at a similar test for @entity3			1
@entity13 has passed his first test in the division and now @entity3 has to do the same			1
then we will have something really special to look forward to in the winter			0
fights involving @entity137 fighters that do n’t like each other definitely sell			0
at the same time , though , they are ambassadors for their sport and they need to behave			0
that is something we will have to deal with closer to the time			0
i also have concerns about @entity148 and @entity149 being in a room together and as their fight draws closer it ’s something we have to plan carefully			2
that is when you know you have a huge fight because it is all so real			2
i think the public sees through fake hype , but the public know how much @entity13 and @entity3 do n’t like each other			1
they just need to make sure they do nothing silly before going in the ring			2
i ’ll make that clear to both fighters – ultimately they are role models and have to be professional			2
fine start : @entity13 began his cruiserweight campaign with a stoppage victory over @entity124 our @entity8 bill on may 17 , on which @entity174 features , will be co-headlined by @entity175			1
the @entity176 , who is @entity137 and @entity178 featherweight champion , is a real sensation			0
he is currently ranked no 3 by the @entity179 , no 6 with the @entity76 and no 10 by the @entity74 and no 12 with the @entity180			1
he is going places fast			0
i can reveal we are lining up a @entity179 title eliminator for that may show with @entity187 featherweight @entity186 , who is 21 - 3			1
that will hopefully manoeuvre @entity175 into a @entity179 world title shot later this year			1
one to watch : @entity176 @entity175 is one of the rising stars of @entity137 boxing over in the @entity192 next week is @entity193 and @entity194			1
i feel like @entity193 is treading water a bit now			1
one thing that often happens when you miss the big fight that everyone wants , like he has with @entity201 , sometimes you stop being relevant			2
that seems to be happening a bit with @entity193			1
i do n’t mean that to sound disrespectful – @entity193 will never be irrelevant			1
but his stock has been affected by getting knocked out by @entity205 , which followed an unfair points loss against @entity194			1
he came back with a win against @entity209 but that ’s not too much to shout about in the grand scheme of his career			0
this @entity194 fight is interesting			1
@entity193 simply has to win for the sake of his career and he is against a fighter in @entity194 who is hugely underrated			1
@entity194 does n’t get the most recognition because he does n’t have the biggest personality and he does n’t carry the hype of his fellow contenders , but he is an extremely dangerous fighter and he is great at adapting in the ring , which is why he is unbeaten in 31			1
tough task : @entity193 will bid to avenge his controversial defeat to @entity194 on april 12 doubt : @entity193 remains convinced he won the first fight with @entity194 two years ago my time : @entity194 wants to be @entity193 again to convince people he deserved the first victory i actually think @entity194 is the favourite going in against @entity193			1
he is the fresher , younger fighter and , unlike @entity193 , he has never been knocked out			1
@entity194 is not a huge puncher , but he is just too fresh for a great fighter who appears to be sliding			1
if @entity193 does lose , i really do n’t think there is a way back for him			1
if he wins , then let ’s all hope that he can finally get it on with @entity201 , albeit for a fraction of the money he would have made if that fight had happened a few years ago			2
i ’m like all boxing fans in that regard – it was a fight i desperately wanted to see			2
but you need to fully appreciate how bad the rivalry is between @entity245 , who promote @entity201 , and @entity246 , who deal with @entity193			2
they seem hell bent on never working together			0
we head to @entity250 this weekend for the 33rd edition of the @entity253 series where eight hungry welterweights will battle it out for the £ 32,000 first prize - you can expect fireworks in this one			0
knockout : the @entity253 tournament returns to @entity250 this saturday with the welterweights @entity253 has been a huge success since its inception in 2008 - it drives the casual viewer into the sport and , in an age of multi-tasking , these fast all action formats continue to strive			0
@entity270 will also take on @entity271 on the show in an eliminator for another crack at @entity275 while popular @entity277 @entity276 and @entity278 also feature			0
we are all counting down to @entity280 at @entity281 on may 31			0
an application has gone into @entity283 to take the capacity up to 80,000			0
i should know more about that this week			0
the pressure is building ahead of my attempt at the @entity289			0
my dad pulled out his times last night and his first was completed in three hours and 52			0
he is putting the pressure on			0
i might be able to squeeze inside four hours but i do n’t know about three hours and 52			0
he was saying his best marathon time was three hours and 22			0
you have to ask yourself if a taxi was involved			0
i would n’t put it past him .			0

@entity3 will make his cruiserweight debut on may 17
he will then have another fight before a rematch with @entity13
@entity175 could be in a @entity179 eliminator with @entity186
i make @entity194 favourite against @entity193
