' i think it looks awesome			2
i 'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to a rugby jersey , but it looks like a rugby jersey , and it 's black , the blackest we 've ever had in fact , and it feels pretty good on			0
' but that is not all			0
due to the differing requirements of both forwards and backs , adidas created specific shirts for each position , which was a popular decision			0
' the big boys need to be able to grip in the scrums , then you 've got the backs who do n't need to do that , so they want it as tight as possible so the other team ca n't get hold of it			0
' ' the team have always said that fit is what 's most important to the players , so it 's great to have two different jerseys for the forwards and backs			0
