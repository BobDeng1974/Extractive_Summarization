drifting on the surface of the ocean , jellyfish - like creatures called @entity3 man o ' war are feared by swimmers and surfers because of their painful stings			0
but one photographer has braved numerous agonising encounters to capture these beautiful creatures on film			0
taken at the waterline , the photographs show the siphonophore ’s luminious tentacles glowing brightly beneath the waves			1
drifting on the surface of the ocean , jellyfish - like creatures called @entity3 man o ' war are feared by swimmers and surfers because of their painful stings			0
they glow because of a natural phenomenon called bioluminescence @entity23 , originally from @entity24 in @entity25 , was attracted to the creatures , also known as bluebottles , because of their vivid colouring			1
found in tropical and subtropical waters , the bluebottles live at the water ’s surface and because they have no means of propulsion , and are carried along by currents , winds and tides			2
however , they are far from helpless because their tentacles deliver a painful sting			0
@entity23 was attracted to the creatures , also known as bluebottles , because of their vivid colouring			1
found in tropical and subtropical waters , the bluebottles live at the water ’s surface ( pictured left and right ) and because they have no means of propulsion , are carried along by currents , winds and tides the @entity47 is a carnivore			2
using its venomous tentacles ( pictured ) it traps and paralyzes its prey			1
it typically feeds upon small marine organisms , such as fish and plankton , but is itself eaten by loggerhead turtles and the blanket octopus , for example bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism			0
it occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates , as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton			0
the word comes from the @entity74 ' bios ' for living and the @entity77 ' lumen ' for light			0
bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction			1
different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways			0
deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light , but @entity93 use it to lure prey with a light - up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish , which they can eat			2
fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens , while their larvae use it to repel predators			0
on numerous occasions the alien - like marine creatures wrapped their tentacles around mr @entity23 ’s wrist and neck , which were not covered by his wetsuit			1
he spent the last 12 months at @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , photographing the @entity115			1
mr @entity23 , 38 , used an ' over-underwater ' technique with a waterproof lens dome he made himself			2
in order to get highlight the glowing effect of the bluebottles he used an underwater flash gun			2
the bluebottles appear to light up because of a natural process called bioluminescence			1
bioluminescence is also the reason why sea waves to light up neon - blue at night			1
tiny plankton are disturbed , causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction			1
organisms such as plankton , jellyfish and anglerfish are able to glow by releasing the chemical luciferin , which reacts with oxygen to create light			2
while some fish use their light to lure prey , it ’s thought that jellyfish and siphonophores glow as a defence against predators			1
for example , comb jellyfish flash brightly to startle attachers , while siphonophores such as bluebottles either display a chain of light or release thousands of glowing particles into the water in order to confuse predators			1
in the bluebottle ’s case , it may draw attention to its venomous tentacles to scare off hungry loggerhead turtles , or equally lure small fish , which it traps and paralyses with its fronds			1
dr @entity169 , a marine biologist at @entity171 's @entity170 , explained : ' bioluminescence occurs widely among some groups of animals , especially in the open sea and in insects			0
mr @entity23 ( pictured left ) spent the last 12 months at @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , photographing the @entity115 ( right ) and suffered numerous stings to his wrists and neck			1
he used an ' over-underwater ' technique with a waterproof lens dome he made himself to create his beautiful images while some fish use their light to lure prey , it ’s thought that jellyfish and siphonophores glow as a defence against predators and in the bluebottle ’s case , draw attention to its venomous tentacles ‘ most marine light - emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater , ’ he said			1
‘ however , some loose - jawed fish emit red and infrared light , and the genus @entity199 emits yellow light			0
‘ sometimes thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of bioluminescent bacteria in the milky seas			0
' mr @entity23 said : ‘ what you do n't see in the still image is the constantly changing dynamics of what 's going on			2
‘ the ocean is surging back and forth , the wind is blowing and these guys are perfect sailors - they motor along in the slightest breeze			0
‘ i 'm also trying to frame all this up whilst treading water or swimming alongside trying not to get stung			0
it can be frustrating at the best of times			0
’ describing what it feels like to be stung by bluebottles , mr @entity23 said : ‘ the stings start out like an electric shock feeling , followed by a stinging , tingling sensation which then dulls to muscle numbness around the area after an hour or two			1
‘ the numbness lasts the rest of the day and too many stings can be potentially dangerous so i do my best to minimise it			0
‘ i guess they do say you have to suffer for your art. ’ describing what it feels like to be stung by bluebottles , mr @entity23 said : ‘ the stings start out like an electric shock feeling , followed by a stinging , tingling sensation which then dulls to muscle numbness around the area after an hour or two			2
here , the creature glows eerily			0
