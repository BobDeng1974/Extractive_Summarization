by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 6 february 2013 @entity1 has asked for permission to start test flights of its @entity1 as the investigation into the battery fires which have grounded the flagship aircraft continues			1
the company is awaiting the green light from the @entity9 to resume flights with test planes so that investigators can study the lithium - ion packs in the air			1
a decision has not yet been made but analysts expect @entity1 to be given the go - ahead			0
positive step : @entity1 has asked for permission to carry out fresh test flights with the @entity1 jet the move comes despite shocking images which were released yesterday of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in @entity26			1
pictures released by the @entity28 showed the blackened lithium device with frayed and broken earth wire			1
investigators are trying to establish the cause of an in - flight fire which forced an @entity35 flight to make an emergency landing in @entity26 last month			1
all 50 @entity1 787s belonging to eight airlines in seven different countries remain grounded while investigations continue			0
@entity42 scans of the overheated lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a week earlier on january 7 which saw another @entity1 make an emergency landing in @entity48			2
the latest probe is said to have found evidence of short - circuiting and ' thermal runaway ' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating			0
the @entity35 flight made an emergency landing in western @entity26 after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin			2
charred to a crisp : the burnt out remains of the lithium battery from a @entity1 which investigators are examining in @entity26 grounded : the fire on board an @entity35 flight forced the plane to make an emergency landing last month damage : a ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred , frayed and broken an investigator in @entity26 at the time said the burned insides of the plane 's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits			1
but on monday @entity1 filed a request with the @entity9 to resume test flights to establish whether conditions in - flight are linked to the battery problems			1
the company performed thousands of hours of tests on the six - jet development fleet before the plane â€™s 2011 commercial debut			1
but a week ago , @entity90 , the founder of @entity91 said the batteries used by @entity1 in its @entity1 aircraft are ' inherently unsafe ' - after it emerged that an airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded			2
all @entity35 said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems			0
flagship : the @entity1 has been hailed as the next step forward in aviation history - but has been beset by problems from the start and @entity107 also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 ' on a few occasions '			2
lithium ion batteries are more susceptible to catching fire when they overheat and are more likely to short - circuit than other types of batteries			0
boeing built in safeguards to gain safety certification for use of the relatively light and powerful batteries to power various electrical systems on the 787 , the world 's first airliner made mostly from lightweight composite materials			0
the string of disasters could potentially cost @entity1 billions although shares rose 0.9 percent to $ 75.89 at the close in @entity127 yesterday			0
the @entity1 has been seen as key a part in @entity1 's plans to take on @entity132 giants @entity131 and despite the delays in production , they were able to re-capture the crown as the world 's largest maker of passenger jets last year , overtaking @entity131 for the first time in a decade .			0
