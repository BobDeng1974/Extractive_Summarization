with the scottish independence referendum just five days away , one of the country 's most famous citizens has finally had his say on the vote			2
@entity6 , the beloved @entity7 character , has revealed that he supports a @entity9 vote in thursday 's poll - and has offered to become the first leader of an independent @entity12			1
the groundskeeper , who is portrayed as an exaggerated version of a stereotypical @entity15 , said in a campaign video that he intended to ' stand in the proud tradition of @entity18 and @entity19 '			1
however , unfortunately for @entity6 , as a resident of the @entity21 he would be unable to vote in the referendum			1
in the satirical clip , he portrays the debate as being between ' the freedom - loving heirs of the @entity39 tradition , and those who enjoy crawling like worms beneath @entity43 boots '			0
@entity6 adds : ' i am hesitant to throw my support to either side - be it the right one , or the obviously wrong one			2
' he goes on to praise the merits of an independent @entity12 , pointing out in particular its whisky industry and oil reserves in the @entity53			1
the video then takes a surreal turn as @entity6 ponders @entity12 's future - and suggests that he is a better choice for the country 's leader than the ' safe choice ' @entity60			1
contest : @entity6 offered to take on @entity60 in the race to become @entity12 leader he says : ' for a leader who can stand in the proud tradition of @entity18 and @entity19 , wo n't you consider the return of @entity12 's prodigal son - @entity6 ? ' @entity6 wo n't back down to world leaders , because i have n't a clue who they are and i 'm not willing to learn			2
' i 've lived in @entity21 most of my life , so i 've seen first hand how not to run a country			0
' he then rips off a shirt and reveals that ' @entity78 or die ' is written on his chest , exclaiming : ' that 's not a tattoo , it 's a birthmark ! ' the video was released ahead of the forthcoming 26th episode of @entity7 , which is broadcast on @entity85 in the @entity43			0
@entity6 is just the latest in a string of expat @entity12 to endorse independence - actor @entity87 , who lives in @entity88 , and @entity90 - based @entity89 are both keen advocates of a @entity9 vote , even though as foreign residents neither of them is eligible to cast a ballot			1
other fictional characters to have spoken out have opposed independence - when asked about the referendum , @entity96 star @entity95 said ' @entity96 wants what the will of the @entity12 people want , ' adding : ' i love @entity12			0
i hope they remain part of @entity43			0
' and @entity105 said earlier this year that he backed @entity107 's call for @entity12 to remain the @entity108 , but that @entity109 was keen on independence so she can make a bid to become @entity112 .			0
