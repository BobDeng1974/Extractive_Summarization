so spare a thought for poor old fisherman , 6ft 3ins @entity9 , for whom - as the last occupant @entity14 's @entity13 - it must have been an almost daily occurrence			1
the big man in the tiny house had just two cramped rooms in which he could stretch out his weary limbs after returning home from sea			1
but now thousands of tourists from all around the world cram inside the pretty 122 - inch tall building ( 10ft ) every year to catch a glimpse of the 16th century treasure			1
squash : @entity14 's smallest house has proved to be a big hit with tourists , according to tour guide @entity30 located on the west coast of @entity34 in the sleepy fishing village of @entity36 , it can only fit four people at a time and is just 6ft wide			1
according to the five members of staff who now offer tours , during peak season dozens of excited visitors from as far afield as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 line up to get a glimpse of this quirky dwelling			2
local tour guide @entity30 , 58 , dons traditional @entity34 dress to give visitors an authentic experience , and explained why the pint - sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters the world over			1
she said : ' thousands of people come to the @entity13 in @entity14 each year			2
that means we get hundreds of people every week during the height of summer			2
move over : with only two rooms , there was not much space for a strapping fisherman @entity9 fisherman : @entity9 spent his days at sea and his nights in this home which now attracts thousands of tourists from across the globe ' i think people are attracted to the novelty of being in such a small space in the knowledge that at one time this was someone ’s entire home			1
' tall people in particular can relate to the last occupant , fisherman @entity9			1
' he was 6ft 3ins tall so would have had an interesting time trying to perform everyday chores			1
' the @entity13 in @entity14 is so small it has been officially recognised by the @entity81 as the @entity83 ’s tiniest house			0
it was occupied for more than 200 - years until @entity9 finally moved out in 1900			0
according to ms @entity30 , neighbouring houses , which were also tiny , were destroyed by the authorities and there were attempts in the past to demolish the building			2
however , local people stood up against town planners and eventually raised enough money to turn @entity9 's house into the much - loved tourist attraction it is today			0
' this house is a great way to show present - day people how we once lived , ' added ms @entity30			0
' there is a little living room with historical pictures and items			0
and stairs lead up to the six - foot by eight - foot bedroom			0
' all the cooking , washing and toilet activities would have been performed outside			0
for many people this house is a total eye - opener			0
' tourist attraction : locals saved the house , which used to be one of several , and it is now a popular destination for people from all over the world			0

the tiny home in @entity34 was once home to a 6ft 3ins tall fisherman
with just two rooms , it only can only fit four *curious* tourists at a time
