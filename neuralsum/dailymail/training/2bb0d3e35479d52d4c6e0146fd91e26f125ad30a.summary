the @entity1 - led coalition against @entity2 was under increased pressure last night as the @entity4 of @entity5 pledged to avenge the brutal murder of one of his pilots			1
@entity9 , a strong ally of @entity11 and @entity12 , had personally taken the decision to take part in controversial air strikes in neighbouring @entity16 that led to first lieutenant @entity17 being burned to death			1
but some @entity5 say they have already paid too high a price to support @entity1 ’s military operations in the region and have questioned the king ’s approach and their role in the coalition			1
significantly , it emerged yesterday that the @entity53 , one of four @entity50 nations in the @entity52 coalition , had already stopped air strikes and would not resume them until improvements were made to contingency plans to rescue downed pilots			1
the king promised a ‘ relentless ’ operation against @entity29 in a defiant speech last night in response to the murder of its pilot , whose f - 16 fighter crashed in december over the jihadi @entity16 headquarters in @entity66			1
speaking on state television , he said : ‘ we are waging this war to protect our faith , our values and human principles , and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground			0
’ the pilot ’s father , @entity79 , who had previously raised questions about @entity5 ’s role in the coalition , called for his son to be avenged			1
‘ i demand the @entity95 organisation be annihilated , ’ he said , as the shock and strain of the sheer barbarity of the murder took its toll on the airman ’s mother , @entity89 , who collapsed and was rushed to hospital after being told details of the death			0
mr @entity79 added : ‘ this murderous organisation , made up of militants from all the world countries , is acting in barbaric ways , violating all the international laws , codes of ethics , and prisoners ’ conventions			0
that is why i strongly demand the government to swiftly take revenge for the blood of @entity110 and the dignity of our country			0
’ @entity9 ( pictured with @entity1 president @entity114 ) had personally taken the decision to take part in controversial air strikes in @entity16 that led to first lieutenant @entity17 being burned to death sickening : a boy enjoys the video @entity2 yesterday issued a video showing crowds celebrating the pilot ’s murder as they watched it on giant screens set - up across @entity66			1
the four - minute video , entitled @entity128 ’ @entity129 of @entity5 pilot , showed men and children gathering to watch footage of @entity17			1
as the airman goes up in flames , the crowd can be heard cheering and shouting religious slogans , before they praise the manner of the murder and @entity29			2
the video is filmed in a documentary style , and among those featured is a young boy who smiles and talks passionately about the killing , as well as other barbaric acts			0
@entity146 has been criticised for featuring the unedited video of @entity79 ’s death on its website			0
the @entity1 news channel , which had not posted the murders of other hostages , was the only media organisation in the @entity1 to offer the video in full			0
@entity154 , an expert on radical extremism , told the @entity156 : ‘ the whole value of terror is using the media to spread terror			0
[ @entity146 ] are literally – literally – working for @entity161 and @entity29 ’s media arm			2
’ @entity5 ’s response began at dawn yesterday when it executed failed @entity41 female suicide bomber @entity165 , who had been on death row since 2005 , and another @entity161 - linked terrorist , @entity167			1
four more jihadis are expected to be executed in the coming days			0
unprecedented outrage and condemnation swept across the @entity171 yesterday at the new levels of depravity reached by @entity29			2
even @entity161 criticised the manner of @entity79 ’s death , saying it provided ‘ conclusive proof of @entity29 ’s deviance ’			1
@entity2 may have decided to burn first lieutenant @entity17 alive after seeing the idea on @entity180			0
fanatics had taken it upon themselves to put forward ideas for methods of execution , writing in @entity186 that they were suggesting ways ‘ to kill the @entity5 pilot pig ’			1
the discussions began just two days after the 26 - year - old was captured in december			0
the messages were then shared thousands of times by the jihadi group ’s web - savvy activists			0
some suggested burning @entity17 alive and running him over with a bulldozer ; in the gruesome video of his execution published by @entity95 , the pilot is indeed set on fire in a cage , which is then flattened by a bulldozer			0
the @entity180 campaign appears to have been a reaction to others writing messages with the hashtag ‘ @entity208 ’ , in which well - wishers – including @entity5 ’s @entity211 and @entity212 – praised the pilot			1
the timing of the execution suggestions lends support to the theory that @entity17 was actually killed at the beginning of january			0
experts say @entity29 ’s gruesome video of the murder would have taken some time to edit before its release			2
however , intelligence officials believe the situation has been manipulated by @entity29 to put pressure on @entity5 and foster opposition to its role in the coalition			1
the fact that @entity5 had agreed to exchange 26 - year - old @entity17 for @entity230 was seen as driving a potential wedge in the coalition because of @entity1 opposition to doing deals with terrorists			1
security has also been stepped up throughout @entity5 as fears of further attacks and suicide bombings grew after @entity95 identified other @entity5 pilots and their family homes on the murder video of @entity17 , urging its supporters to attack them			2
a recently retired intelligence officer warned : ‘ while the government is trying to create the impression that it is working for @entity5 ’s interests , people do n’t believe it			2
’ @entity9 was yesterday greeted by a crowd of several thousand people at @entity5 ’s main airport as he returned from the @entity1 , with many holding up pictures of the monarch , the pilot and their country ’s flag in a show of support			1
in his televised speech he urged his countrymen to unite			0
‘ it ’s the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of @entity5 in the face of these hardships , ’ he said			2
military planners admit that while the @entity53 , @entity5 , @entity269 and @entity270 have all flown missions against @entity29 in @entity16 , they are seen as primarily symbolic amid criticism in the region that it is an @entity1 war that does little to force out @entity16 ’s president , @entity274			1
@entity275 , a spokesman for the @entity5 armed forces , yesterday described @entity17 as a ‘ martyr ’ and said their ‘ revenge will be as huge as the loss of the @entity5 ’			2
intelligence officials believe they have identified the location in @entity66 , near the @entity282 , where the pilot , locked inside a cage , was doused in petrol before being set alight .			0
