@entity0 , 48 , is on trial accused of killing a former @entity2 who died when an alleged stunt in a vintage @entity6 aircraft went wrong a former @entity2 pilot killed his passenger after crashing his aircraft while performing a ' foolish and dangerous ' loop - the - loop at a low height , a court has heard			1
@entity0 , 48 , allegedly carried out the acrobatic manoeuvre in his @entity6 plane , despite passenger @entity15 being too big for the move to be carried out safely			1
the court heard how @entity0 , described in court as a novice , was ' reckless ' for attempting to perform the stunt at a height ' at which recovery was improbable '			1
@entity0 's ' risk - taking ' allegedly caused the plane to nose - dive into a field near @entity26 , @entity27 , killing mr @entity15			1
the 26 - year - old was a former @entity2 who served in @entity30 and @entity31			0
@entity0 , from @entity32 , @entity27 , also suffered serious injuries during the crash , from which he has since recovered			1
he denies manslaughter and endangering the safety of an aircraft			1
opening the case at @entity40 , @entity41 , prosecuting , said : ' the prosecution case is that the fatal crash was caused as a result of conscious risk - taking by @entity0 , in that he flew the aircraft in a way which created an obvious risk of serious injury to @entity15 , and @entity0 either chose to disregard it or was indifferent to it			1
' the prosecution submits that what he was intending to do was plainly dangerous and created an obvious risk of serious harm			0
' mr @entity57 told the jury of six men and six woman that , at 18st 7lbs and 6ft 2in , mr @entity15 ' size placed restrictions on how the aircraft should be manoeuvred , something @entity0 should have known and made the flight unsafe			1
he said @entity0 had flown 35 hours in the aircraft , making him a ' novice ' in it , and that he was not trained to perform the loop - de - loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting			1
the jury was told the flight was the second @entity0 had flown from the @entity70 in @entity27 that day , having taken another friend up in his plane earlier			1
mr @entity57 said he had successfully completed several loops with the other passenger and that gps tracking suggested he crashed near where these previous acrobatics had taken place			0
' the location of the fatal manoeuvre and the improbability of @entity0 's own account of the loss of control , and evidence from eye witnesses on the ground , all point to the fact that this was indeed an attempted loop , ' said mr @entity57			2
the plane crashed into a field near @entity26 , killing mr @entity15			1
the 26 - year - old was a former @entity2 who served in @entity30 and @entity31 and ran a maritime security company @entity0 had flown 35 hours in the aircraft , making him a ' novice ' in it			1
he was not trained to perform the loop - de - loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting , the court heard the court heard how the pair took off from the airfield at about 2.49pm , with the weather described as ' a pleasant spring day '			0
the fatal crash happened a short time later , at 3.08pm			0
@entity0 , who had a private pilot 's licence , had flown 184.8 hours at the time of the crash , but only 35 hours in the @entity6 , making him ' inexperienced ' in it			1
mr @entity57 described to the jury how eye - witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash			0
the plane , built in 1940 , then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first			0
mr @entity15 was sat in the front seat of the plane , with @entity0 behind him ' the prosecution say eye - witnesses saw the aircraft entering a loop , ' said mr @entity57			1
' that point is absolutely disputed by the defence , who say it never happened			0
thereafter the aircraft entered a spin from which it did not recover			0
' eye - witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash			0
the plane , built in 1940 , then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first , the court was told mr @entity57 said @entity0 had ' no formal training in aerobatics			1
' he also told the jury the plane was flying too low to attempt a loop manoeuvre			2
when interviewed , @entity0 claimed he lost control of the aircraft due to ' a control restriction			2
' he said that following a left - hand turn , the rudder remained to the left			0
@entity0 told investigators who launched a probe into the flight that he pulled back on the stick in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft , which may have made it appear as though he was performing a loop			1
during his interview , @entity0 said he understood an aircraft needed to be at 3,000ft to 3,500ft to recover from a spin			2
however , mr @entity57 said the plane had been much lower than that when he performed loops earlier with his previous passenger , @entity162			0
' the prosecution case is that it was an attempted loop and it was far too low because when the plan got out of the loop it was too low to do anything about it , ' said mr @entity57			0
after the crash , horrified bystanders dialled 999 and paramedics and fire crews rushed to the scene to help			0
emergency teams spent around an hour cutting away the fuselage at the front of the plane so they could free mr @entity15			2
mr @entity15 , who was in ' a very bad way ' , was flown to @entity177 on a coastguard helicopter			2
@entity0 was also taken to @entity177 for treatment to his injuries			0
mr @entity15 was pronounced dead later that day			0
a post mortem examination showed he died as a result of multiple injuries			0
the court heard from an expert , who told the court it was ' reckless ' of @entity0 to attempt a loop manoeuvre at the height he was flying			1
although gps data of the final seconds of the flight was lost , it did show he was flying 1,423ft above the ground moments earlier , thousands of feet lower than he should have been before starting a loop			0
@entity0 had previously ' dangerously ' performed loop manoeuvres far below the height a novice should have been doing them			1
emergency teams spent around an hour cutting away the fuselage at the front of the plane so they could free mr @entity15			2
he died later that day at @entity177 the jury has been told inexperienced pilots , such as @entity0 , should be no lower than 3,000ft after completing a loop - the - loop			1
mr @entity57 said gps data showed that on a flight on february 12 , 2011 , the former @entity2 dropped to 393ft above the ground when apparently performing a loop			0
aviation expert @entity209 told the court that the heights at which he was performing the acrobatic stunts were described as unsafe and ' plainly not simply foolish , but dangerous '			1
reading his expert report , mr @entity57 said mr @entity209 believed it was only ' a matter of luck ' that @entity0 had previously performed loops successfully			1
mr @entity209 said it was ' beyond belief ' that @entity0 was unaware of the guidance on the height at which aerobatic manoeuvres should be performed			1
he said : ' to attempt a loop at such a low height with his limited level of experience was quite simply reckless in my opinion			1
' mr @entity209 believed @entity0 's explanation that the spin had been sparked by a jammed rudder was ' not credible '			0
the expert concluded that what @entity0 was doing before the crash was a ' deliberately attempted loop '			2
mr @entity57 said : ' he was clearly aware of the recommended height limitations for aerobatic manoeuvres and yet chose to disregard them , possibly encouraged by previous experience , having done it at that very low height			1
' mr @entity209 's view is that ... what he was attempting to do was plainly dangerous and created a serious risk of harm to his passenger , @entity15			2
' on previous occasions tracked by the gps , @entity0 was also flying lower than he should have been even when not performing manoeuvres , the jury was told			2
according to the gps data , @entity0 performed @entity251 in his three previous flights before the fatal crash - twice on february 12 and once earlier that day			1
in each case , the aerobatics were performed above the @entity258 area , near where the deadly crash occurred , the court heard			0
on the day of the crash , the data showed that in the first flight @entity0 was flying at 1,000ft before dropping to 409ft , apparently after doing a loop			2
mr @entity57 said the data proved @entity0 was going back to the area where he had previously performed loops , even if it did not show he was doing one before the crash			2
' this occurred in the same location that the aircraft carried out other aerobatic manoeuvres on all three of the previous flights , ' said mr @entity57			0
' he was going back to @entity258 to do what he did at @entity258 , which was loop de loop			0
' the jury was shown photographs of the wreckage surrounded by emergency crews			0
an investigation into the fatal crash was carried out by the @entity283			0
the court heard that the investigation had found no sign of malfunction with the plane 's rudder			0
mr @entity57 described how the @entity6 was a training plane used by the @entity290 until 1952 and 4,000 were built in the @entity291 with many still in use as recreational aircraft around the world such as the one involved in the accident which was built in 1940			2

@entity0 , 48 , took @entity15 for a flight in his @entity6 aircraft
he allegedly performed stunt despite @entity15 being too big for it to be safe
plane crashed into field in @entity26 , killing @entity15 and injuring @entity0
@entity0 had flown 35 hours in the aircraft making him a ' novice ' , court told
expert told court move was ' foolish and dangerous ' because of low height
@entity0 , from @entity32 , @entity27 , denies manslaughter - the trial continues
