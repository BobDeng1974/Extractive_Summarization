just as i ca n't travel to @entity1 without thinking of @entity2 , so i ca n't travel to @entity3 without thinking of @entity4			1
their songs of beaches , baggies , boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun - kissed paradise , and their voices sounded as bright and as laid - back as @entity14 itself			1
this time i was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band			1
their songs sounded as bright as a sun - kissed paradise , their voices sounded as laid - back as @entity14 itself i started in @entity26 where the three @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 - were raised , and joined up with guitarist @entity30 and vocalist @entity31 to form a group			1
the @entity34 home on 119th street , where the boys taped their first single @entity37 ' in 1961 , was demolished to make way for @entity39			2
the rest of the street remains though , its neat lawns , porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group 's clean - cut @entity46 origins			1
a redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the @entity50 , with a bas - relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here ' broadcast to the world an image of @entity3 as a place of sun , surf and romance '			1
@entity26 is indeed a place of sun ( 263 days a year ) but no surf and little romance			1
it 's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry ( @entity69 is only five miles away )			2
i could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get ' bugged ' driving ' up and down the same old strip '			2
@entity75 , with its low - rise jewellery shops and furniture stores , is no place for the young			1
the @entity77 added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling @entity4			1
i started in @entity26 where the three @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 - were raised , and joined up with guitarist @entity30 and vocalist @entity31 to form a group now run by the son of the original owner , it retains its kitsch medieval @entity88 interior , with wrought iron chandeliers , tiled awnings and mock grilled windows			1
@entity92 , another gathering place , is a blue - roofed fast - food outlet that offers food from one service hatch and ice cream from another			1
when i arrived @entity99 , a 1963 hit by @entity100 , was playing over speakers in the overhang			2
this was the very ' hamburger stand ' where @entity105 saw a girl pull up in her father 's @entity107 and had the inspiration for @entity110			2
@entity113 , around the corner on @entity112 , is where the @entity105 boys and @entity30 attended			2
@entity4 came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song @entity118			1
the nearest surfing beach to @entity26 is @entity120 , but the best is @entity121 , better known as @entity122			1
here the sand is soft , the surf is year - round , and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles			1
other than @entity126 , @entity4 were famously non-surfers , but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean - side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it			1
they mentioned @entity121 in @entity134			2
the city of @entity121 makes much of its surfers			2
there 's a @entity138 , a @entity139 and a small @entity140			0
the sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses , caps and jeans			1
my hotel , the @entity150 , had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read wiped out rather than @entity155			0
it was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfers bobbing about in the ocean			0
from the pier i could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall , grey waves			1
as if on cue , a local surf music tribute band , @entity164 dressed in faded blue denims and short - sleeved @entity167 shirts , began playing at the pier entrance			1
an even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when @entity175 drummer @entity174 took me to an outdoor gig in @entity177 , @entity178 , where he played with bassist @entity179 ( ex-nomads ) , and guitarists @entity183 ( @entity182 and his @entity185 ) and @entity186 ( the @entity181 )			0
we picked up @entity186 from his apartment			0
he was wearing a baseball cap , blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye			0
on the drive down he told me his story			0
as a 15 - year old schoolboy in 1961 he 'd composed a hit tune called mr @entity200 for @entity181			1
that summer , when playing at the @entity203 in @entity204 , a leading surfer came over to him and said : ' wow , man ! your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave			0
you should call it surf music			0
other than @entity126 , @entity4 were famously non-surfers , but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean - side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it when @entity4 adopted this sound the hard - core sports crowd initially shunned them			1
' as long as they posed as surfers they were resented by those in the true beach culture , ' @entity186 told me			0
' but when they went on to celebrate @entity14 youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising , that broadened their appeal			0
after that , even surfers appreciated them			0
' when @entity4 started recording their focus shifted from @entity26 to @entity236			1
they signed with @entity237 , whose 13 - storey circular tower at 1750 @entity240 , built in 1956 , has become an @entity3 landmark			2
legend has it that the architecture was based on the image of a bunch of singles stacked on the spindle of a record player			0
the night i visited , @entity251 were playing a promotional set on a specially built platform outside the tower			0
@entity4 ' earliest albums were recorded at @entity237 but by the time of @entity257 and @entity258 , they were also recording around the corner at @entity260 and @entity261 ( 6050 @entity262 )			1
now called @entity264 , this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album @entity267			0
in 1965 , @entity105 bought the then - modern 1448 @entity268 in @entity269 with its great views over the @entity3 basin			2
that summer , when playing at the @entity203 in @entity204 , a leading surfer came over to him and said : ' wow , man ! your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave			0
you should call it surf music ' it was here that he notoriously built himself a huge sandbox in the living room to stimulate his creative juices			0
( the video for @entity286 was filmed in the garden pool			0
) two years later he moved to 10452 @entity289 in the more upmarket gated community of @entity291			0
several @entity4 ' albums , including @entity293 , @entity294 , 20/20 and @entity295 , were partially recorded here , while @entity296 , a fringe figure on the @entity3 music scene in 1969 , visited to tape songs that he 'd written			1
in songs such as @entity258 , @entity300 , @entity302 , and @entity110 , @entity4 explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot - rodding			1
illegal street racing still takes place but usually in the early hours of the morning , and it 's a crime even to be a spectator			0
custom car shows tend to happen out in the desert rather than in the city			0
but at the @entity313 ( 6060 @entity314 ) it 's possible to see everything from hot rods and deuce coupes to @entity318 and @entity319			0
spread over two spacious floors , there are plenty of cars from the era @entity4 celebrated - a peach - coloured 1957 @entity325 once owned by @entity326 , a black 1957 @entity327 , and a wonderful boat - sized 1959 red @entity328			1
the hot rod section has a classic @entity331 customised from a 1932 @entity332			0
appropriately the museum cafe , @entity333 , is a 50s - style diner with red plastic seating , chrome surfaces and neon signs			2
on my final day i headed north on the @entity339 to @entity340			0
there 's probably no road that better embraces the joys of @entity3 - steep hills and canyons to one side , broad beaches and ocean to the other on my final day i headed north on the @entity339 to @entity340			1
there 's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of @entity3 - steep hills and canyons to one side , broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a @entity4 ' soundtrack			1
the group even recorded a song about it in 2012			0
a left - hand turn took me a mile down a hill to a private beach edged with cliffs where the group was photographed for the cover of 1962 's @entity134 , and again two years later for @entity367			2
@entity360 is now home to one of the world 's most luxurious trailer parks			0
film directors , screenwriters , models and @entity236 actors such as @entity375 and @entity376 have swapped bricks and mortar for transportable homes with a view			0
a surfboard - shaped sign ironically declared @entity383			2
the warning was somewhat redundant as beaches can be private but the sea is free and , anyway , the waves are so mild that no serious surfer would choose it			2
maybe that 's why @entity4 came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot			1
getting there @entity396 ( virginholidays.co.uk , 0844 557 3859 ) offers five nights at the @entity398 in @entity121 from Â£ 915pp			0
this includes return flights from @entity401 , accommodation on a room - only basis and car hire			2
