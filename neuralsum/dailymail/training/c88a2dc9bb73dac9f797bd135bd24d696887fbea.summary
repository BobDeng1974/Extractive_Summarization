by @entity0 ' the perfect bridge player 's death ' : @entity3 died while playing a winning 29 - point hand of cards one of @entity7 's leading bridge players died immediately after being dealt a ' once in a lifetime ' hand because she ' could n't take the excitement '			1
@entity3 , 80 , collapsed in front of friends while playing a remarkable 29 - point game but even her heartbroken son admitted today : ' it was a lovely way for her to go '			1
the grandmother of 12 suffered heart failure at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , during her regular tuesday night bridge night			1
bereft friends said today they were in shock , but admitted it is the ' perfect bridge player 's death '			1
in the panic nobody checked her cards but she may have had four aces , four kings , and a jack - almost unheard of in bridge circles			1
she had played the game for five decades and achieved the hallowed status of @entity35 , but experts said today a 29 - point game is so rare it is unlikely she ever had one			1
her son @entity40 said : ' i can imagine the smile on her face when she looked at her cards and she knew she had a winning hand			1
she died doing what she loved to do			0
' the other members of the bridge club responded magnificently and tried everything to revive her			2
' but when all is said and done , it was a lovely way to go			0
remarkable : in the chaos after the much - loved grandmother died nobody noted down her hand , but experts have speculated it probably had four aces and perhaps four kings ' her death was obviously a great shock and was very sudden , but looking back we are very happy she went this way			1
' when i go myself i would love to think i 'll go out like this , doing something i love			0
' the maximum points total for a bridge hand is 37 , meaning she had almost three - quarters of the scoring cards in a pack			1

' in effect she played this remarkable hand and collapsed and died immediately afterwards			2
each of the four players , split into two teams , receives 13 cards in a hand			2
the object of bridge is to win tricks			2
each person will ' bid ' for tricks , based on how many they believe their cards can help them win			0
they will make this ' bid ' based on the number of scoring cards they have			0
these are as follows : ace : four points @entity101 : three points queen : two points @entity105 : one point there are 13 tricks to be won and a trick consists of four cards - one from each player			1
the highest card wins the trick , unless a trump card is laid			0
in this instance , experts have suggested that the winning hand contained a jack , four kings and four aces			0
' @entity3 had 29 points in her hand			1
i have n't seen a 29 point hand , if ever , or certainly not for a very long time			2
' i ca n't remember seeing one with more points than that in the past 18 years or so			0
' @entity3 will no doubt have been extremely excited by getting such a hand			1
my theory is that she could n't take the excitement			0
' it 's very sad but what a way to go			2
it 's the perfect bridge player 's death '			1
@entity3 was sitting around the table with her close pal @entity136 , 66 , when she slumped forward in her chair			2
another close friend and playing partner , @entity140 rushed over to help , but by then @entity3 was already dead			2
@entity136 said : ' she was delighted to have played that hand			0
she had n't even put her cards away when she went , it was very sudden			0
i knew instantly she was gone			0
' @entity3 was exceptionally kind , terrific fun to play with , and she 'd been playing for donkey 's years			1
' if you had asked her a fortnight earlier how she would have liked to go she would have said : at the card table			0
' tragedy : the bridge ' doyenne ' fell ill at the @entity18 , an old railway station at @entity19 , @entity20			0
