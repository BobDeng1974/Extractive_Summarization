if you have time on your hands and the urge to wander , it could be the ideal proposition for you			0
a luxury travel firm is offering a 365 - day tour spanning four continents and 32 of the most exclusive hotels on the planet			1
the only catch is the price – because at £ 220,000 per person , it is likely to be well outside most people ’s price range			0
starting in the @entity17 kingdom of @entity18 , the holiday takes in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity22 – ending 19 countries later in @entity24			1
the year - long jaunt is being offered by @entity19 specialist @entity38 and hotel group @entity40 , and it is understood a number of wealthy clients have already expressed an interest			1
@entity45 , managing director of the company , said : ‘ this trip will feel like being part of a private club and guests will be treated like royalty			2
it aims to appeal to high net worth individuals in need of a pampering sabbatical			0
’ however , should travellers really need to get in touch with the office , mr @entity45 promises that ‘ each hotel offers connectivity ’			2
the itinerary is designed to celebrate the best of each country , with visits timed to take in the most awe - inspiring sights			0
it begins in march 2015 , with spring in @entity18 – when the @entity17 are alive with flowers			1
next is @entity67 , where travellers will have access to a private white sand beach and the opportunity for excursions on the @entity73			0
then it is a tiny tropical island , @entity75 , in the @entity76 in the @entity77			0
the idyllic atoll is less than 600 yards across , and the surrounding @entity79 is the perfect spot for sailing , windsurfing , fishing or snorkelling			0
the year - long trip also includes an 11 - night stay in the @entity31 in @entity32 , pictured @entity33 and @entity34 held their lavish wedding ceremony at the @entity31 in september following that is @entity89 , with a chance to explore four of @entity92 ’s @entity91 including the @entity93			1
sushi and @entity96 ’s @entity95 come next , then a @entity98 marine reserve			0
and despite this extensive tour of @entity19 probably being enough for most holidaymakers , the tour then heads for @entity21 after a relaxing cruise down the @entity104 archipelago			1
the first stop is @entity106 , and – after a stay on the @entity110 coast – the trip heads to a 15th - century village in @entity112			1
@entity113 is spent in @entity32			2
then , as the northern hemisphere braces itself for winter , the tour returns to @entity18			1
and just in case the trip becomes a bit too relaxing , travellers can get their blood pumping on the ski slopes of @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124			0
at the end of january the tour heads to @entity127 , before finally ending in rural @entity24			2
however , the company is keen not to exclude those whose diaries are looking a bit too full to justify a whole year on holiday – and they are also offering the trip in a series of 90 - day breaks .			2
