christmas trees are already on sale despite there being almost 40 days until the big day there are almost 40 days still to go , but major retail chains have started selling real @entity7 trees			1
the move goes against the advice of experts who recommend waiting until at least the first week of december to buy a real tree , and then keeping it away from radiators to ensure it has n’t faded to a twig by @entity7			1
the usual peak for sales is seven to 10 days before @entity7			1
retailers are always keen to bring forward the festive trading period in any way they can			1
however , 10 @entity24 and 35 @entity25 stores have been selling pot grown trees for the past two weeks and began selling cut trees yesterday			1
trees grown in a pot from seedling stage last longer as they have a fully formed root system			2
some @entity34 and @entity35 stores started selling real trees at the weekend			2
shoppers have a choice of the traditional @entity39 , which is renowned for quickly drying out and dropping its needles , together with the more expensive @entity42 and the luxuriant @entity43 , which will last longer			2
the official advice on the website of the @entity46 reads : ‘ it is suggested that trees should not be purchased earlier than december 1			1
’ shopper @entity48 , who noticed @entity34 selling trees at a store in @entity51 , said : ‘ if you put a @entity7 trees up now in a house with central heating it will be dead in a few weeks			1
by @entity7 it will look like a stick			1
‘ all the needles will drop or the branches will droop in a few weeks and we have about five and a half weeks to go before @entity7			1
how are you supposed to defy nature ? a tree will be dead by @entity7			1
‘ we have n’t even got to the first sunday in @entity64			0
why are people buying them now ? it ’s miles too early , you ’ll have to buy another one in a few weeks to make sure it looks good for @entity7			1
’ she added : ’ it ’s all rubbish and one - upmanship			0
it ’s nothing to do with @entity7 if you have the tree now			1
why is it getting earlier and earlier ? ’ @entity77 , of the @entity46 , said the useful life of a cut tree depends on the variety and how it is cared for			0
buying @entity7 trees this early could leave them ' looking like a stick ' by the time the big day arrives ( file picture ) ‘ the @entity42 tends to last longer than the @entity39 , ’ he said			1
‘ it is a bit like buying a bunch of daffodils			0
most people can tell the difference between a nice fresh bunch and some that have been sitting around for a while			0
it is the same with a tree			0
‘ to prolong the life , it is a good idea to cut half an inch off the bottom and leave it outside to stand in a bucket of water for while so it can drink in the water			0
you then need to put it into a stand where you can top it up with water every day			0
‘ you would n’t put a bunch of flowers next to a radiator and you should adopt the same policy with a christmas tree , otherwise it will dry out			2
’ he added : ‘ the earlier you buy a tree the more difficult it is			0
after all , it is a cut plant			0
our advice would be to wait to get a christmas tree until the first week in december and try and make sure it is freshly cut			1
try keeping it topped up with water and cool			0
’ many families have switched to artificial trees in recent years on the basis these can be re-used			2
at the same time they are cheaper than spending anything from £ 20 to £ 50 on a real tree			0
the @entity132 says a real tree can be ‘ greener ’ than an artificial one			0
it estimates that a two metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg of carbon dioxide , in terms of the energy involved in manufacture and transport , which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill , and more than ten times that of real trees that are burnt			2
mr @entity77 said around six million real trees are sold in the @entity151 every year and this figure appears to be holding up			2
‘ for many families the tradition of going out to buy the christmas tree creates memories that last a lifetime			0
very few people reminisce about getting the artificial tree out of the loft , ’ he said .			0
