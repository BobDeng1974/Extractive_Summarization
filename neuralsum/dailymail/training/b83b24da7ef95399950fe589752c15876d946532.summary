@entity0 has revealed a car lighting technology that can make the back of its cars show bright patterns to other drivers			1
this ' swarm ' is made up of thousands of small red lights that cover the width of the boot and react to movements of the car			1
the screens are designed to show other drivers what the driver it doing - but motoring organisations told @entity19 the technology should stay a concept			1
when the driver presses the accelerator the lights move faster , and when the car brakes the lights flow forward when the driver turns the wheel , the red dots flow in the direction it has been turned			1
when the car speeds up the number of dots , or ' fish ' , increase and they flow faster around the surface			1
swarm technology is made up of thousands of organic light - emitting diodes ( @entity41 )			1
these small points of red light flicker and move like a swarm of fish			2
the movements of the red dots follow the movements of the vehicle			0
when a right turn is made , they flow to the right			2
when the driver brakes , the dots flow forward			0
the faster the car goes , the faster the dots move			1
when the driver brakes , the dots slow down and flow forward onto the top of the boot			0
@entity0 â€™s swarm lights are made up of thousands of organic light - emitting diodes ( @entity41 )			1
these diodes can be added to any surface			0
when an electrical charge is put through this organic material , the diodes light up			1
@entity0 claims these lights mean drivers in cars behind can always see what the driver of the car in front is doing			1
however , a spokesman from the @entity71 had a different view , ' @entity73 is a delightful concept design but under current lighting regulations it is probably best saved for aquariums or art galleries			1
' if they pass safety tests , the swarm lighting could replace the traditional braking lights on future @entity0 cars			2
@entity0 unveiled its swarm lighting technology at the @entity84 in @entity85 last week			2
the @entity87 car maker also announced a laser tail light			2
oleds are made up of thin films of organic particles			1
in the @entity0 example , these particles are spread thinly onto a flat , polished glass surface			0
it can also be spread onto flexible plastic surfaces , and will work as the surface bends and moves			0
the covering only needs be a few thousandths of a millimetre thick			0
when an electric charge is sent through the covering , the particles emit photons and any surface covered by the material lights up			2
the light and colours produced by @entity41 are brighter than leds because they are multi-layered			0
oleds are more energy - efficient because they use less electricity to produce a brighter light			0
in good visibility , the laser tail light shines a fan - shaped red line from the back of the car			0
it is used to prompt the driver behind to keep a safe distance , similar to a stop line			0
in fog or spray , the laser beam bounces off the water in the air and turns the line into a triangle , similar to the warning triangle used on breakdowns .			0

lights designed to look like moving swarms of **animals**
respond to movement and direction of the car
as the car speeds up the ' **animals** ' move faster
technology uses lights made from organic material
the @entity71 warns it is ' best saved for art galleries and aquariums '
