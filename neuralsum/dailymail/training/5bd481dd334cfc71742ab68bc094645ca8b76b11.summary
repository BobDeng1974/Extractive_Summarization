other , similar technologies change the friction between the finger and the screen using static electricity , and @entity13 claim the use of ultrasound is a world first			1
it is also a breakthrough technology because ultrasound vibrations usually need a large amount of energy to work effectively			2
this is the first time it ’s been developed to run on smaller devices with mobile batteries			0
@entity65 developed a similar system in october that uses an algorithm for @entity69 touchscreens that modifies the friction between a user 's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at			1
the company claims that it can reproduce edges , ridges , protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology			0

@entity13 said : ‘ while technologies already exist that convey texture by vibrating the touchscreen display panel itself or by generating static electricity , @entity94 has developed the industry 's first technology to use ultrasonic vibrations to convey tactile sensations by varying the friction between the touchscreen display and the user 's finger			1
‘ this technology enables tactile sensations – either smooth or rough , which had until now been difficult to achieve – right on the touchscreen display			0
' users can enjoy realistic tactile sensations as they are applied to images of objects displayed on the screen			0
’ by varying the ultrasonic vibrations , using a layer beneath the screen , this reduces friction and creates what @entity13 calls a ‘ floating effect			1

high pressure air makes an image feel slippery to create a ‘ bumpy or rough ’ touch sensation , the prototype table quickly switches between high and low friction , in response to where the fingers are placed on the screen this tricks the brain into think the screen is slippery , and mimics liquid			2

this combination of tactile information , visual information from the display , and audio information from the speakers can trick the brain into thinking it ’s touching something physical			0
@entity65 researchers have worked with a different technology to create a similar effect			2
they used an algorithm for @entity69 touchscreens that modify the friction between a user 's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at			2
@entity65 said the technology can be used to feel soft , fragile features ( pictured ) examples demonstrated by @entity13 include a @entity14 harp , which gives users the sensation of plucking the strings of a koto , a traditional @entity14 harp			2
the @entity169 demonstration gives the impression that users are touching a cd placed on a mixing deck , using volume and other controls as if they were physical buttons			0
as a user turns the lock in the vault demonstration , sound and tactile feedback gives the illusion of turning a combination lock on a safe			0
one key feature of @entity65 's algorithm is that it can be implemented in real - time			0
a 3d model of objects ( like the kettle seen here ) can be zoomed and panned in real - time to sense fine edge and protruding features of the object while the @entity194 demonstration gives the sensation of touching the skin of a real - life alligator			0
@entity13 continued : ‘ by enabling more realistic and intuitive operability , the tactile sensory technology in this prototype has wide - ranging potential applications , including for electronic product catalogues , on tablets and other devices			1
’ the technology could lead to textured maps where users can feel tall mountains , new apps for visually impaired people and more interactive touchscreen games			0
the firm aims to develop the prototype further , and increase the amount touch sensations , before making it available to buy in 2015			0

@entity13 ’s technology uses ultrasonic vibration to mimic textures .
it varies the amount of friction between the display and the user ’s finger to create the illusion of different *surfaces* .
other , similar technologies use static electricity .
the prototype tablet was on display at @entity252 in @entity1
