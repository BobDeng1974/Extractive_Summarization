the pair were both working at @entity31 , a sheet metal manufacturer in @entity33 , @entity34 , when tragedy struck in september 2013			2
@entity7 was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building 's roof , taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television			1
but he accidentally touched a 400 - volt busbar , a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard , while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests			1
forensic pathologist @entity51 told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on @entity7 's arm			1
family : the 19 - year - old was working with his father @entity8 , an experienced electrician , at the time of his death he said : ' i gather @entity7 was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called @entity31 to conduct a complete electrical inspection			1
' one of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof			0
in order to gain access , @entity7 had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located			1
' his father was working in the premises at the time			1
a short time late his father saw @entity7 fall head first into the roof of the toilet block , about 12ft			1
he did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall			2
' he went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition , although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse			2
' dr @entity51 told the inquest the cause of @entity7 's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground			1
his mother @entity93 , 47 , said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son @entity95 , who worked at @entity31			0
she told the inquest : ' he said , " do n't panic mum but @entity7 has had a fall			1
" i remember saying , " why , what happened ? " he said , " he has fallen from a ladder			0
" ' i asked if he was ok and he said he did n't know as he was n't conscious			0
he said , " you need to get here as soon as you can mum			0
" i just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over			0
' i remember running up the stairs to get to him			0
i just got more or less up the stairs and i saw the paramedics trying to save him			0
' workplace : @entity7 and his father were carrying out electrical tests at @entity112 in @entity33 in a statement mr @entity7 , 50 , who has been an electrician for 32 years , said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in september 2012 after embarking on a three - year training course , and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident			1
he said : ' as an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics , switches , sockets and lights			2
' you would only ever allow @entity7 to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability , knowledge and competence			1
' mr @entity7 said he had carried out work at the @entity31 premises twice before , and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an ' @entity136			2
' he said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10 - tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead			2
he told the inquest : ' as far as i am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking " danger high voltage "			2
i have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign			2
' had i been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then i would not have continued to take this work			0
in all 32 years ' experience with busbars i have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident			0
' that was the worst and fastest day of my life			0
it 's a blur but i ca n't get rid of some of those thoughts			0
the test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a tv into a wall			0
' i 'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again			0
he was the light of my life and my family and i will miss him so much			0
time is a great healer and i hope that will be the case			0
