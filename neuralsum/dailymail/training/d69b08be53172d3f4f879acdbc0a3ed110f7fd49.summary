by @entity1 reporter published : 20:40 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 03:13 est , 6 december 2012 most families who order a turkey for @entity4 expect to pick it up			2
@entity6 , however , had a shock when one turned up outside her door – of his own free will			2
fortunately for the bird , which had escaped from a nearby farm in @entity13 , mrs @entity6 , 62 , already had one of his friends in her freezer and had no need for additional dinner table fare			1
instead she simply took some photographs to record the moment			0
a great escape : this turkey escaped a local farm before being spotted by residents running around a suburban neighbourhood in @entity13 plucky bird : @entity6 discovered the turkey hiding behind shrubs on her driveway on @entity31 yesterday , mrs @entity6 told how a young boy called at her home on @entity31 to ask ' have you seen a turkey walking around the estate ? ' she initially dismissed the door - knock as a prank and shut the door - but when she saw the worried lad still outside she went out to investigate			1
retired mrs @entity6 said : ' i asked him where the turkey was and he said it was hiding behind a bush			0
he then took me to where it was			0
' all i could see was these black feathers and all of a sudden he reared up and emerged from the bush			0
a new home : the @entity52 managed to capture the bird - which has since been nicknamed @entity54 - and take him to a local bird sanctuary ' imagine the shock when he ran out in front of me and started strutting around			1
' the young lad had stayed out there for hours with the bird while he waited for someone to come out			1
mysterious : a spokesperson for the @entity52 said it 's unlikely they will ever know where the bird came from ' he was clearly upset at the thought of the turkey being out all night and worried a fox would probably get it			1
' at one point he even tried to catch it and put it in his own garden			0
' i told him he had done everything he possibly could for the turkey and that he deserved a medal for his efforts			0
' i had my own turkey already so when it walked up the drive i thought " oh no , i ’ve got one of his mates in the freezer "			0
' the @entity52 were called to the street on november 28 and managed to catch @entity54 before taking him to a nearby animal sanctuary			1
a charity spokesperson said the bird had been taken to the vet and checked over but they did not know where it came from			1
she said : ' we were asked to come and retrieve a black male turkey after a member of the public had corralled him in to a garden			0
' an inspector and and animal collection agent arrived and took the bird to an animal rescue centre nearby			2
' at this time of year a lot of people who would n’t normally do so farm turkeys on an ad - hoc basis			1
' perhaps a local farmer had been keeping them in a spare field and this one managed to escape			2
' if their wings are n’t clipped properly they can easily get over a fence and make a run for it			0
' so it ’s likely that it ’s a farm turkey but we wo n’t ever know for certain			2
