like the components of some abandoned @entity3 , the carefully pickled remains of animals lie slowly stewing in jars stowed in this eerie abandoned place			1
after decades of neglect , even the formaldehyde that preserves these parts of anatomy has yellowed with age , while the specimens themselves slowly fall apart			2
the patina of age colours these scenes from an abandoned laboratory - equipped with anatomical samples including parts of kittens and dogs to a pigs head and even whole rats - with a palette reminiscent of a gothic novel			2
inside of the abandoned @entity24 of @entity25 , @entity26 : hundreds of anatomical samples sit decaying in yellowing formaldehyde in this abandoned laboratory that has been all but forgotten for more than two decades but was found by a @entity31 urban explorer who goes by the pseudonym @entity34 and took these pictures gruesome : a decaying brain sample has sullied the preservative fluid it was kept in , while right dozens of microscope slides litter the floor , gathering dust dark place : the patina of age colours these scenes from an abandoned laboratory - equipped with anatomical samples including parts of kittens and dogs to a pigs head and even whole rats - with a palette reminiscent of a gothic novel , but it was in reality only finally closed in 1990 @entity55 collection : the shelves of the lab strain beneath the weight of countless samples , each the body part of some long - dead creature it is all that remains of @entity64 of @entity25 in @entity65 , @entity26			1
the centre for experimental animal science has stood abandoned since 1990 and , like so many historic places , is soon to be transformed into luxury apartments			1
these last glimpses of the gruesome , decaying evidence of endeavour in physiological science were captured by a @entity31 urban explorer who prefers to go by the pseudonym @entity34			0
he said : ' @entity79 , as this location has been nick - named , is like something out of a horror - film			0
' my images show what lies behind the walls of a neo-renaissance veterinary school in @entity26 which now lies derelict and decaying ' people are initially horrified that this sort of place exists , but are equally intrigued and want to see more			1
' who ( would ) live in a house like this ? the centre for experimental animal science has stood abandoned since 1990 and , like so many historic places , is soon to be transformed into luxury apartments experiments : a blood - stained tray lies on the table amid various samples and , curiously , next to what looks like an unsmoked cigarette an animal 's intestines that have been kept for examination : the urban explorer who infiltrated the site and took these photos says it has earned the apt nickname ' @entity79 ' a goat 's snout is still well preserved in its embalming fluid : the building housing this part of the veterinary school has stood abandoned for 23 years a goat 's snout is still well preserved in its embalming fluid : the building housing this part of the veterinary school has stood abandoned for 23 years the site comprises 19 @entity120 style buildings , constructed in the early @entity121 , which were later incorporated into the university of @entity123 in 1969			1
in 1990 the buildings became derelict and were listed			2
all but one of the buildings have since been converted into executive homes			1
but this grisly secret still hides deep within the bowels of the one remaining , undeveloped structure			0
' it 's like being in some crazed professor 's laboratory containing all manner of grotesque animal organs and body parts , ' he said			0
' at any moment you half expect the professor to come bursting through the door to punish you for invading his laboratory			0
' @entity145 as this place seems , it once served a crucial purpose , a school dedicated for the training of veterinary surgeons			0

grisly images captured in the derelict @entity24 of @entity25 in @entity65 , @entity26
it has lain abandoned and derelict for more than two decades , while surrounding buildings have been developed
soon , this place too will be transformed into executive homes . but who would want to live there ?
