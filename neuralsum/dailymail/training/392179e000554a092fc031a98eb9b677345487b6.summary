by @entity1 reporter published : 18:10 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 18:12 est , 26 november 2012 @entity2 is demanding that the @entity3 return a $ 2.1 million research grant after chilling reports of gruesome animal cruelty were uncovered			1
the animal rights organization 's demand relates to one of countless tales of animals suffering in horrific conditions at @entity3 , which has one of the largest medical research programs in the country			1
recipients of research grants are required by the @entity18 to adhere to a lab animal welfare policy			0
seven years ago , @entity3 paid $ 92,500 to settle federal findings that its researchers had violated the @entity22			1
tragic : @entity24 the rhesus monkey endured a chronic painful infection but was still kept on a research study for two years by the @entity3 now @entity18 reports which have recently become public record have revealed that incidents of animal neglect and mistreatment have persisted			2
some of the worst abuses include laboratory mice having toes removed without anesthesia			1
several animals - including birds and a squirrel monkey - receive little or no pain medication after surgical procedures			1
one primate was starved for weeks , while mice were allowed to die of thirst			1
animal rights supporters complain that a $ 92,500 fine is lose change to the university in comparison to the research grants which bring in millions of dollars			1
critics of the system argue that there is not a strong enough incentive for @entity3 to improve standards			2
the tragic case study that has so angered @entity2 relates to a female monkey called @entity24			0
researchers studying @entity58 implanted a device in @entity24 's skull so that gene therapy could be delivered directly to her brain			0
as is common practice , the screws were left in the monkey 's skull when the device was removed			2
a squirrel monkey was found to have received little or no pain medication after surgical procedures monkeys and mice were amongst the animals found to have been mistreated by @entity3 vets soon noticed that @entity24 became lethargic and picked continually at the spot on her head			1
over the next two years the veterinary staff treated her with painkillers , further surgery and even removed the screws , but the wound remained unhealed			0
only after two years of persistent pain for @entity24 , did vets find that a piece of acrylic had been left in her head since the 2008 implant			0
a photo of the miserable - looking monkey , with a wide , red wound at the top of her head was taken by federal inspector who arrived unannounced just days after the acrylic was removed			0
three week later , researchers euthanized @entity24			0
' allowing an animal to remain on a study for almost two years while undergoing repeated invasive treatments for chronic complications of the study is not consistent with the intent of this section of the @entity22 , ' the inspector wrote			0
@entity3 has one of the largest medical research programs in the country ' keeping an animal on study under these circumstances does not avoid or minimize discomfort , distress , or pain to that animal			1
' the inspector also cited @entity3 for failing to remove foreign material , a violation of the research protocol			2
although the university says its study led to a clinical trial now under way , the inspector made it clear that @entity24 should not have been involved once her distress was evident			0
' there are many thousands of animals suffering every day , and on top of that , you have @entity3 failing to provide many of them with adequate veterinary care when they 're sick , ' said @entity134 of @entity2 , which is calling on the @entity18 to force @entity3 to return the $ 2.1 million grant that funded the study in which @entity24 was involved			2
@entity3 has one of the largest medical research programs in the country and relies on hundreds of thousands of animals as its researchers try to develop treatments for diseases of all kinds			1
@entity3 said it takes the care and use of the animals it studies very seriously and tests on animals are a last result the @entity150 enforces the @entity22 at research institutions around the country , usually with one unannounced visit a year			1
the inspectors look for violations , which can trigger a second unannounced visit to see if they 're fixed			0
' the university takes very seriously the care and use of the animals it studies , beginning with ensuring that as few animals as possible are used in research , ' spokeswoman @entity161 told the @entity164			0
she said @entity3 uses computer models and cultured cells for research if it can			2
if those wo n't work , researchers turn to animals			0
@entity3 : due to negligence or errors , laboratory mice had toes removed without anesthesia			1

the @entity3 has one of the largest medical research programs in the country
despite being fined $ 92,500 in 2005 for violating the @entity22 , the @entity181 continues to mistreat animals
laboratory mice had toes removed without anesthesia
a squirrel monkey and some birds received little or no pain medication after surgical procedures
one primate was starved for weeks , mice were allowed to die of thirst
