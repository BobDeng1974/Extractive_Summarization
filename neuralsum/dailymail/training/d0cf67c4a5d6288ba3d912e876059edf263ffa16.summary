and the 18 boys as young as eight molested by paediatric consultant @entity0 are probably only a fraction of his victims – as a series of official blunders gave him time to destroy his sick library of films			1
the doctor was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse by the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1

it was finally closed down in a @entity37 police raid in the summer of 2012 and the concerned officers soon dispatched the names of customers globally			2
the company was closed down in 2012 and the names of customers passed to police forces worldwide			2
but it was only when @entity19 was absorbed by the @entity45 last november that @entity0 ’s name was passed to @entity48 police			1

one patient examined – and possibly filmed by @entity0 – yesterday told the @entity86 : ‘ he would ask to get me in the room on my own , and say i ’m old enough to go in a room on my own			1
‘ and then he ’d want to check me			0
instead of checking just my joints , he ’d want to check my whole body			0
‘ he ’d make me strip down			0
he focused on my private parts			1
’ speaking of the possibility that there were many more victims of @entity0 , det sgt @entity97 of @entity48 police yesterday told the @entity86 : ‘ unfortunately the hard drive had been removed from the laptop			1
‘ i do n’t know how many examinations he ’s done , so i do n’t know how many possible cases there are of live abuse by him			0
‘ so how many movies of examinations were on that hard drive we ’ll never know			0
