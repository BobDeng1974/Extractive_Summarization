@entity0 is now just three weeks away and many of us who are hosting will have our shopping list sorted and our recipes planned			2
the smoked salmon blini - a fish starter on a bed of cream cheese topped with lemon - is a staple festive canapé			1
the @entity29 family has specialised in hand curing fish since 1963			1
using traditional methods , natural ingredients , oak chippings and lots of manpower			2
founder @entity29 developed a unique smoking technique and he and his three sons , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 ( who is the current @entity53 ) are the only four people in the world to know the secret recipe			1
the process involves salt , smoke , and brushing back the natural fish oils into the salmon during the smoking			1
this helps to give the unique taste and texture that @entity29 's , @entity31 has become famous for			1
their smoked salmons scooped two prizes at this year 's @entity70 - the wild was one of them			1
@entity73 was a little too oaky , with an overpowering flavour @entity75 and @entity76 smoked salmon ( l ) and @entity79 salmon wild salmon is a rare product because fishermen have to comply with @entity84 pre-set quotas and the ultra-short window the wild salmon are in the appropriate area			1
the family source it from nearby shores and the salmon is then prepared for hand smoking in the original family smokehouse			1
they started shipping to the @entity17 two weeks ago - just in time for @entity0 - and promise to have your order to your door from @entity98 within 24 hours			2
prices for @entity29 's @entity28 start from £ 12.50 for a small 125g portion - more than double the regular high street price for smoked salmon - through to £ 79 for a whole side			1
as a smoked salmon enthusiast i had no qualms about taste testing four varieties			1
the others were @entity75 , @entity25 and @entity27			1
@entity29 's comes in at almost three times the price - £ 12.50 for 125g			1
my colleague made a little canape using each variety and i tried them all on camera			1
fourth place : @entity116 , £ 2.66 per 200g @entity25 did n't impress compared to the others			1
it has crunchy little bits in it and the colour was pale			2
however , it 's fantastic that you can even get smoked salmon at this price , and it does taste okay			1
third place : @entity73 , £ 4.80 this smoked salmon from the @entity126 was a little too overpowering on the oak flavour , quite unusual			1
a lovely smoked uniform colour though , so it would look good for a dinner presentation			2
second place : @entity131 , £ 3.69 per 100g @entity26 was actually a close second , and considering the price , it is incredibly good value			1
the texture was smooth and silky with little fat to cut through			2
it 's worth paying an extra few pounds to get your hands on this			1
first place : @entity29 's wild , £ 12.50 for 125g or £ 25 for 250g my favourite was actually @entity29 's			1
it tasted healthy , firm and lean , and it was succulent with a rich , deep flavour without being overpowering			0
makers say it tastes ' as natural as possible ' , nodding to the way the fish is caught - swimming through the @entity152 on its migration route as nature intended			0
it 's almost 10 times the price of @entity25 salmon per gram			1
but @entity29 's careful selection , curing and smoking processes , artisan skills , age - old recipes and fine fresh ingredients reflect in the superior taste			1
the high price mark up from farmed to wild smoked salmon is a product of the strict limit in fishing and difficulty in sourcing			1
but why did it taste so much better ? regular smoked salmon - the farmed kind seen on most supermarket shelves - has a particularly high in fat content because the fish have usually been reared in small confined areas where they can not swim freely and put on muscle weight			1
wild smoked salmon , on the other hand , have naturally swum hundreds of miles through migration to spawning grounds and contain just a third of the fat of farmed version			1
@entity186 , director of the @entity187 , has described the two types of smoked salmon - wild and ' flabby ' farmed - as virtually two different foods			1
he said : ' the farmed salmon is a couch potato compared to the majestic and iconic wild salmon			1
