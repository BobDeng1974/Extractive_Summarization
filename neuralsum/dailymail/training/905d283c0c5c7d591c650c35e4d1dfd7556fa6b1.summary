by @entity1 reporter a computer glitch could help smokers get affordable coverage through @entity5 next year despite a rule allowing insurance companies to charge them much more than non-smokers			1
in yet another delay for the health care overhaul , the @entity10 administration has quietly notified insurers that the system glitch will limit penalties insurers are allowed to charge			2
the glitch , which will take at least a year to fix , is more likely to benefit older smokers			1
oops : the @entity10 administration says a computer glitch may help smokers , especially those 60 and over , skirt insurance premium penalties under @entity5 however , younger smokers could wind up facing higher penalties than they otherwise would have			1
a june 28 @entity25 document couched the smokers ' glitch in technical language : ‘ because of a system limitation ... the system currently can not process a premium for a 65 - year - old smoker that is ... more than three times the premium of a 21 - year - old smoker , ’ the industry guidance said			1
if an insurer tries to charge more , ‘ the submission of the ( insurer ) will be rejected by the system , ’ it added			0
starting in 2014 , the law requires insurance companies to accept all applicants regardless of pre-existing medical problems			2
but it also allows them to charge smokers up to 50 percent higher premiums , a way for insurers to ward off bad risks			2
not for everyone : while older smokers may benefit , younger smokers could pay more than they otherwise would have if insurers respond to the glitch with a blanket fix for an older smoker , the cost of the full penalty could be prohibitive			1
premiums for a standard ‘ silver ’ insurance plan would be about $ 9,000 a year for a 64 - year - old non-smoker , according to the online @entity63			1
that 's before any tax credits , available on a sliding scale based on income			0
for a smoker of the same age , the full 50 percent penalty would add more than $ 4,500 to the cost of the policy , bringing it to nearly $ 13,600			1
and tax credits ca n't be used to offset the penalty			0
the underlying reason for the glitch is another provision in the health care law that says insurers ca n't charge older customers more than three times what they charge the youngest adults in the pool			1
the government 's computer system has been unable to accommodate the two			0
so younger smokers and older smokers must be charged the same penalty , or the system will kick it out			1
that 's not what insurers had expected			0
slow : the @entity10 administration announced the glitch in late june , saying it will take at least a year to fix before the glitch popped up , experts said the companies would probably charge lower penalties for younger smokers , and higher penalties for older ones			1
‘ generally , a 20 - year - old who smokes probably does n't have much higher health costs than someone who does n't smoke in any given year , ’ said @entity104 , an insurance market expert with the nonpartisan @entity106			1
‘ a 60 - year - old is another story			2
’ the administration is suggesting that insurers limit the penalties across all age groups			0
the @entity117 guidance document used the example of a 20 percent penalty			0
in that case the premium for a 64 - year - old would be about $ 10,900 , a significant cut from the $ 13,600 if insurers charged the full penalty			2
it 's unclear what insurance companies will do			2
a spokesman for @entity130 , the main industry trade group , said insurers were aware of the issue and expected the administration would fix it eventually			2
another workaround for the companies would be to charge the full penalty to both younger and older smokers			1
in that case , there would n't be any savings for older smokers , and younger ones would see a big price shock			1
roll out : the @entity5 health insurance markets , in which the uninsured will be able to buy health plans , are set to roll out october 1 despite a string of delays @entity104 said he suspects insurers would keep the penalties low to sign up more young people			1
@entity152 said he thought they would do the opposite			0
‘ it 's going to throw cold water on efforts to get younger people to sign up , ’ he said			0
workers covered through job - based health plans would be able to avoid tobacco penalties by joining smoking cessation programs , because employer plans operate under different rules			0
but experts say that option is not guaranteed to smokers trying to purchase coverage individually			0
some see an emerging pattern of last - minute switches and delays as the administration scrambles to prepare the october 1 launch of the new health insurance markets			1
people who do n't have coverage on the job will be able to shop for private insurance , with tax credits to help pay premiums			2
small businesses will have their own insurance markets			1
last week , the @entity183 unexpectedly announced a one - year postponement of a major provision in the law that requires larger employers to offer coverage or face fines			0
officials cited the complexity of the requirement as well as a desire to address complaints from employers			0
‘ this was an administration that was telling us everything was under control , ’ health care industry consultant @entity194 said			0
‘ everything was going to be fine			0
suddenly this kind of stuff is cropping up every few days			0

older smokers likely to benefit , saving around $ 4,500 per year
younger smokers could pay more than they otherwise would have
the glitch will take at least a year to fix
@entity5 health insurance markets launch october 1
