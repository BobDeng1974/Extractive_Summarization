by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 03:24 est , 16 november 2012 level playing field : @entity3 managing director @entity2 has called on the government to look at the way foreign multinational companies pay tax in the @entity8 high street institution @entity3 said it could be put out of business if foreign multinationals are not forced to pay more tax in the @entity8			1
@entity14 , managing director of the retailer , issued a stark warning about the effect on domestic businesses if the government does not create a level playing field			1
he said companies in overseas tax havens will ' out - invest and ultimately out - trade ' businesses paying full taxes in the @entity8			1
mr @entity2 has now called on the @entity27 to look into the ' principle ' that underpins where earnings are taxed - suggesting that @entity8 companies are not competing on a level playing field			2
his comments come two days after bosses from @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 were subjected to a three - hour grilling by mps over how they manage to pay little or no corporation tax on their @entity8 operations			1
all three denied accusations they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and were met with derision from members of the @entity46			2
last year , @entity47 , which is owned by its 76,500 staff , who receive a share of any profits at the end of the company 's financial year , reported half year profits fell 18 % due to increased investment and it 's commitment to be ' never knowingly undersold '			0
profits were also affected by ' extremely challenging ' conditions , including competition from other high street and online retailers			0
mr @entity2 told the @entity63 @entity64 that the tax issue was wider than any rivalry between @entity3 and companies such as @entity36			1
he said : ' our customers expect around a fair and level playing field and i suspect our customers do think both companies should be treated in the same way			0
' mr @entity2 said overseas companies will effectively be able to invest more in the long run thanks to low tax bills			1
he said : ' you have got less money to invest if you 're giving 27 % of your profits to the exchequer than , clearly , if you 're domiciled in a tax haven and you 've got much more			2
' so they will out - invest and ultimately out - trade us and that means there will not be the tax base in the @entity8			1
so i do think it 's an issue that needs to be examined			0
' mr @entity2 also argued that the @entity27 should look into the ' whole question ' of whether earnings from a particular country were taxed in that same country			0
earlier this week @entity36 public policy director @entity95 received criticism from mps when he appeared before the @entity97 ' committee			1
taxing : @entity95 , director @entity99 at @entity36 , was grilled by @entity97 this week over basing their @entity102 operation in @entity103 threatened : @entity47 , which runs more than 40 department stores in the @entity8 , including this store in @entity106 , said it will be ' out - traded ' by foreign multinationals unless a fair tax playing field is created ( file picture ) @entity46 chair @entity110 said that he was not a ' serious person ' after failing to give key information and vowed to call in another @entity36 executive to fill holes in his evidence			1
she said : ' the idea that you come here and simply do n't answer the question and pretend ignorance - it 's just not on , it 's awful			0
' she also told the executives before her : ' we 're not accusing you of being illegal , we 're accusing you of being immoral			0
' @entity126 , political director of the @entity127 , echoed the call for the government to investigate the current tax system			2
he said he ' understood the public anger ' over the issue			0
he added : ' but what we have to remember is that they are operating within rules and legislation , set by a succession of governments of all colours , that have provided loopholes in a tax code which is thousands of pages long , incredibly complex and burdensome			0
' what the call from @entity14 for an investigation should mean , is that the government should not only be looking at multinationals and how they pay tax but how all businesses pay tax in this country			1
' @entity36 told mps at the beginning of the week that it used @entity103 as a base for its @entity157 operations because of the favourable tax rate there			1
@entity95 , the online retailer 's public policy director , said the @entity103 business 's turnover in 2011 was £ 7.3billion yet it paid taxes of just £ 6.4million			0
it paid no @entity8 tax in 2010 on revenues of £ 3.3billion			0
@entity35 paid only £ 6million to the @entity27 last year on @entity8 sales of £ 2.6billion			2
@entity34 was strongly criticised for paying just £ 8.6million in tax in 14 years of trading in @entity8			2
it paid none in 2011 on revenues of £ 398million			0
under pressure : the bosses of @entity36 , @entity35 and @entity34 faced a grilling by mps over their tax affairs			1
