@entity0 made a mess of a first half free - kick and @entity3 made it six games without scoring for @entity6 as the @entity8 champions were beaten by @entity9 in their first defeat in qualifying for eight years			1
@entity0 ’ clanger allowed @entity13 to give the hosts the lead and with @entity17 defender @entity16 getting the better of @entity3 it always looked as if @entity19 ’s side would leave empty - handed			1
@entity6 substitute @entity20 equalised with eight minutes left to make it two goals in two games for him but @entity26 ' cross was headed home by former @entity29 midfielder @entity28 three minutes from time and @entity9 took all three points			1
subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68			0
goals : @entity13 17 , @entity54 87 @entity6 : @entity0 , @entity70 ( @entity71 81 ) , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 58 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 ( @entity20 71 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity3			1
subs not used : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90			0
goal : @entity20 82 @entity3 ’s international goal drought looked like coming to an end in the first half as his combination with @entity78 almost broke the deadlock inside the first 10 minutes			1
the midfielder crossed from the right and @entity3 ’s header went fractionally wide			0
he was coming into the game having failed to score in his first six matches for his adopted country , in stark contrast to nine goals in nine games for @entity29			0
the @entity107 - born striker had started brightly and was seeing plenty of the ball			0
unfortunately @entity0 did not see the ball at all at the other end of the pitch when he handed @entity9 a shock lead			2
the @entity6 keeper had made a brilliant save moments earlier from @entity116			0
@entity50 crossed from the right , and with @entity0 wrong - footed , @entity118 striker @entity116 thought he had scored but the @entity120 keeper changed direction and turned the shot away for a corner			1
but on 18 minutes @entity13 drove a free - kick through a less than convincing @entity6 wall and with a slight swerve the driven shot seemed to confuse @entity0			1
had he not moved he would have caught the ball but he had already gone right and when he readjusted his position , his fumbling block could not prevent the ball hitting the back of the net			0
it should have been a special night for @entity0 , moving into second place for all - time international appearances for a @entity8 player , with only @entity139 ’s @entity138 on 165 having played more			1
@entity6 and @entity140 defender @entity72 looks in dismay during his side 's shock defeat by @entity9 @entity19 named a strong team against @entity9 - with the likes of @entity76 , @entity3 and @entity80 all starting for @entity6 @entity29 midfielder @entity78 also featured for @entity6 against @entity8 rivals @entity9 @entity3 , pictured on the receiving end of a tackle by @entity17 's @entity16 , played the full 90 minutes against @entity9 @entity9 's match - winner spent four years as a @entity29 player , although he never started a @entity152 game for the club			1
in 2010 the winger was sold to @entity156 side @entity155 , where he looked to have revitalised his career , scoring 14 times in his first two seasons			0
but no goals in 17 games in the 2012/13 season saw him fall out of favour , and @entity54 was loaned to @entity118 in @entity164			0
after a decent spell he returned to @entity166 , only to be loaned out again , this time to @entity167 in @entity168 , where he plays alongside former @entity170 striker @entity169			0
so far this season he has scored twice in three games , as well as making two appearances off the bench for @entity9 , including thursday 's crucial cameo			1
but @entity0 ’ 158th game had been ruined by an error that now put @entity6 on the back foot			1
@entity78 and @entity3 led the charge to get back into the match and @entity3 in particular was everywhere , including in the face of @entity16			0
the two clashed off the ball and were both spoken to by the referee			0
ten minutes before the break @entity3 so nearly had his first goal for @entity6 when he headed @entity78 ’ corner goalwards			2
@entity49 pulled off a fine save and then saved @entity188 ’s acrobatic volley from the rebound			0
@entity3 was denied at the start of the second half and @entity78 also went close but the @entity29 pairing were unable to get @entity6 back into the game			2
it was in @entity9 nine years ago that @entity6 ’s record goalscorer @entity195 netted the first of his 59 goals and the reigning @entity8 champions had hoped @entity3 – the man they see as the heir to @entity202 ’s throne – would also get off the mark here			1
despite his blistering form for @entity29 he played in a disappointing 1 - 0 friendly defeat by @entity207 last month and then missed their 5 - 1 win over @entity209 a few days later			2
some @entity211 fans even wanted that team – with @entity213 youngster @entity20 leading the line – to be used again for this game			0
@entity20 replaced @entity216 ’s @entity76 with 20 minutes left and scored the equaliser from @entity75 ’s cross			2
it seemed that would set - up a grandstand finish and give @entity3 the opportunity to break his duck with the winner			2
@entity9 had other ideas though and from @entity26 ’ cross @entity28 got the winner			2
@entity213 striker @entity20 came off the substitutes ' bench to score his second goal for his country @entity3 congratulated his fellow striker after @entity20 scored past @entity9 goalkeeper @entity49 @entity29 striker @entity3 was unable to add to his personal goal tally for the season as he was kept quiet all evening @entity0 could lose his first team spot to @entity237 's @entity236 as he was at fault for @entity9 's first goal @entity54 was mobbed by his international team - mates after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal @entity19 saw his side fall to their first defeat in a qualifying campaign for eight years @entity6 full back @entity75 tries to rally his team - mates after conceding to @entity9 in the @entity40 qualifying match @entity249 and @entity250 react to conceding a late winner against @entity9 in their @entity253 qualifier @entity255 v @entity254 highlights			1

@entity9 ace @entity28 scored in the 87th minute to give his side all three points
@entity120 goalkeeper @entity0 was at fault for @entity9 's opening goal
@entity6 's no 1 appeared to *misjudge* @entity13 's 17th - minute opener
substitute @entity20 put @entity6 on level terms before @entity54 's late winner
@entity6 recorded their first defeat in a qualifying campaign for eight years
@entity3 's international goal drought continued on thursday night
