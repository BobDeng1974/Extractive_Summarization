by @entity0 from the clean - cut adverts featuring pretty , sleeved dresses to the new in - store food halls , everything is calculated to seduce mrs @entity5			1
but , no , this is n’t @entity8 : it ’s @entity9			1
remember @entity9 ? it was the @entity11 ’s last bastion of flammable tat and elasticated waists			2
but , after making a loss of £ 71 million last year , its @entity15 - tanned owner sir @entity14 seems to have settled on an aggressive new strategy : copying @entity8 in every possible way			1
' people do n't want to buy cheap rubbish , ' sir @entity14 says bluntly			0
' people want to buy nicer things			0
' @entity9 is about to fight @entity8 by introducing 50 new food halls , a range of high - quality homeware in vamped - up shops and a new line of well - cut clothing designed for older women			1
in sir @entity14 ’s quest to capture mid-market woman , he has also been busy poaching a host of senior staff from @entity8 , including managing director @entity39 , womenswear trading director @entity40 and head of childrenswear buying @entity43			1
sir @entity14 is clearly moving in for the kill but , as he walks me through his souped - up collection at @entity9 ’s @entity48 headquarters , he steadfastly refuses to be drawn into comparing @entity9 and @entity8 directly			1
instead he talks about his new target customer : ‘ a @entity5 mum — a slightly older demographic ’			2
sounds familiar ? ‘ people do n’t want to buy cheap rubbish , ’ he says bluntly			0
‘ people want to buy nicer things			0
’ squint slightly and everything looks like it could have come from @entity8 — albeit for a fraction of the price — from a smart print jacket to a @entity64 - alike monochrome body - con illusion dress for £ 35			1
then there ’s the new @entity66			0
for the moment they ’re stocking only basic groceries — no gourmet tv dinners likely to trouble the @entity8 food hall — but the swanky style of some of the posh nosh planned for the @entity77 gifts section makes it clear that battlelines are being drawn			1
homeware is also being taken very seriously			0
sir @entity14 wants it to pass his acid test : ‘ if you put it on a table , without a label , can you guess it ’s from @entity9 ? ’ a candle in a glass jar catches his eye			2
‘ how much is that ? ’ he demands			0
‘ ten pounds , ’ a quivering subordinate splutters			0
that ’s great ! £ 10 ? that ’s fabulous			0
i want my wife to see that			0
i ’m taking that with me			0
£ 10 ? @entity100 , ’ he says , scooping it up			0
but he ’s not done with blowing the @entity9 trumpet : ‘ somebody well - known texted me last week and said : “ i just happened to go into @entity9 and bought four fabulous lights and some fabulous home stuff			1
” ’ which of his celebrity friends could it have been ? @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , or perhaps @entity111 ? ‘ just someone you ’d know , ’ he says , with a nudge - wink smirk			0
so how do @entity9 ’s offerings compare with those from @entity8 ? the answers may surprise you … all @entity9 branches had food halls for years , but they were closed in the late @entity120			1
now sir @entity14 is testing the waters with two @entity66 in @entity123 and @entity124			0
another will open in @entity126 in four weeks			0
so is there likely to be a @entity9 chicken tikka masala or cottage pie ? so far , it seems not , with the @entity66 offering instead an affordable mix of branded goods — such as @entity133 at £ 1 for two litres and @entity135 gravy granules at £ 1 for a 170g jar — as well as alcohol and fresh and frozen foods			2
the stores are punctuated by giant price signs and red stickers boldly announcing ‘ £ 1 ’ or ‘ 85p ’			0
it ’s not very @entity8 , but sir @entity14 says that customers are already going for a less ‘ larder - stocking mix ’ than expected — with fresh food doing well — so the potential for selling posher groceries is definitely there			1
and take a look at the @entity77 gift items that will be in the main department store ( yes , they ’ve already been planned )			0
there are £ 35 hampers , swanky chocolates and big , classy bottles of infused olive oil that are distinctly upmarket			0
this is @entity9 ’s heartland , and the retailer has really gone for it , with everything from £ 15 duvet sets inspired by @entity162 and @entity163 to bravely quirky floor lamps for £ 130			2
the products are high - end and smartly grouped into design styles , including next season ’s sophisticated ‘ @entity174 ’ look — all soft , luxurious textures in the proverbial 50 shades of grey , highlighted by expensive - looking metallic gleams			1
@entity77 collections , too , will go far beyond baubles and tinsel , with stylish and quirky bedding , lighting and decorations that would look at home in @entity182 ’s or @entity183			0
@entity9 ' @entity185 dinner plate , £ 3 , @entity8 ' @entity187 dinner plate , £ 7.50 with everything pulled together into room - sets styled up to look like @entity190 , @entity9 could be a real secret weapon in decorating the home			1
in contrast , @entity8 feels like a very cohesive collection but slightly bland — all very tasteful but not nearly as much fun			2
@entity9 has a strong vintage streak , while @entity8 is more contemporary but less vibrant			1
the different takes on this year ’s favourite owl cushions say it all — @entity9 has a funny little thing by quirky young label @entity199 & @entity201 , while @entity8 offers a more subtle cushion in shades of brown			1
two plates tell the same tale : @entity8 ’s pretty but crisp @entity208 dinner plate versus @entity9 ’s painterly , confident @entity210 dinner plate			1
prices , surprisingly , are almost on a par in many cases , although @entity9 is still erring towards the cheaper side			2
@entity9 ' @entity216 bra , £ 16 , @entity217 for autograph silk bra , £ 22.50 @entity8 ’s loyal customers love its lingerie with a passion — and it ’ll be nigh on impossible to lure them away			1
in any case @entity9 ’s current range simply does not reach the heights of @entity226 ’s satin drawers			2
however , it does have some pretty lace bras from just £ 12 — a price that is on a par with @entity8 ’s most basic bras — and many are made in the same factories as @entity8 ’s , so the quality is up there , if not the variety			1
most @entity8 shoes now feature the comfort - enhancing @entity237 inner soles			1
but @entity9 has a rather stylish collection featuring foot - friendly details such as low block heels and low wedges			1
there are also a couple of good statement bags , although some do look cheap close up			0
but at around £ 20 , they ’re half the price of @entity8 ’s			2
@entity9 ' wide - fit peep - toe slingbacks , £ 15 , @entity8 ' peep - toe @entity237 slingbacks , £ 17.50 the bread and butter of both @entity8 and @entity9 ’s clothing lines have long been easy - to - wear basics : t - shirts and blouses , comfortable trousers and classic office wear that wo n’t scare the horses			1
however , @entity8 has also spent years developing more high - profile brands — like the @entity262 , @entity263 , and love - it - or - loathe - it @entity8 — that cover every base from beachwear to eveningwear			1
@entity9 is now taking the same path by renaming its classics range ‘ @entity270 ’			2
but instead of grouping clothes by brand , @entity9 is grouping them by category — t - shirts , occasionwear , shoes , and so on			2
this undoubtedly makes it easier to shop for specific items			0
after all , if you want to buy a cardigan , it makes sense to have all the cardigans in one place rather than scattered around the shop			0
@entity9 ' @entity288 shift dress , £ 55 , @entity290 prom dress , £ 89 for this spring / summer , the frumpy - but - functional @entity9 utility trousers are still selling in the hundreds of thousands — but many of its key pieces , such as smart dresses and jackets , are well - tailored , fashionable , tasteful and distinctive			2
a great deal of effort has been put into fabrics , too — historically one of @entity8 ’s strengths			0
at @entity9 , @entity40 ’s product knowledge seems to be shining through here , to the possible detriment of her former @entity8 bosses			1
the daywear includes some surprisingly sophisticated , well - cut wiggle and shift dresses , costing between £ 30 and £ 50 — slightly less than similar dresses in @entity8 ’s standard ranges			1
@entity9 ' @entity312 crepe tunic dress , £ 25 , @entity8 ' zipped pocket shift dress , £ 39.50 and there are plenty of sleeves ( oh happy days ) , lower hemlines and generous cuts to please the less - than - coltishly slim			1
knitwear is still basic , with some acrylic faux - cashmere jumpers that will have you crackling like an electric force field			0
however , there are pure cotton cardigans for £ 15 in a rainbow of shades that sir @entity14 says he is proud of			0
but at the moment , @entity9 is still a long way from the breadth of @entity8 ’s knit collections			1
when it comes to next autumn ’s coats , @entity9 has a range starting at £ 45 , from little - old - lady sensible to gently fashionable — a relatively conservative approach that may well appeal to those turned off by the styling extremes of the @entity339 collection			2
eveningwear has gone glam , too : there are well - tailored vintage - looking dresses with lots of lace and gold jacquard , impressive amounts of beading on the necklines and accessories to match			0
skirt lengths are elegantly low and , as well as the younger looks , there are forgiving pieces that will hide middle - aged spread .			0

the fight to seduce mrs @entity5 is on as @entity9 and @entity8 begin battle
@entity9 are introducing 50 new food halls , high - quality homewear
perhaps most *importantly* , @entity9 will release new line of women *'s* clothing
a number of senior staff from @entity8 have recently moved to @entity9
