he stepped off the plane in @entity2 very much the @entity3 and , despite @entity5 's best efforts , he will fly home as the @entity3 as well			2
it 's not that @entity5 did a great deal wrong in @entity10 's underwhelming 1 - 0 win over @entity11 , but when @entity12 resorts to bringing on a player who before the match declared himself fatigued to provide the spark it does n't bode too well			1
the ' tired one ' was @entity5 's @entity19 accomplice @entity18 and with an uninspiring @entity10 trying to break down 10 - men @entity11 after the hour mark , he was summoned from the bench to offer a much - needed injection of pace			1
@entity5 carries the ball forward on one of his trademark driving runs as @entity10 search for the breakthrough @entity5 carries @entity10 's attack during the second half as they seek to take advantage of having a man more @entity5 's heat map from the match showed how he covered a great swath of the midfield @entity18 was introduced to good effect as @entity10 chased a goal in the second half @entity5 is not without speed but he simply ca n't muster the raw acceleration that @entity18 can when needs must			1
he had impressed for much of the first - half but faded a little after the break and fresh legs were definitely required to lift @entity10 to the victory that maintained their perfect start to @entity50 qualification			1
tiredness eventually catches up with even 19 - year - olds and @entity18 , who has been carrying a heavy burden of expectation for both club and country this season , felt it necessary to tell @entity12 on the eve of the match that he was suffering the effects			0
@entity18 , who was taken off at half - time in thursday 's rout of @entity64 with the more demanding trip to the @entity66 in mind , had very much been @entity12 's @entity68 and the @entity10 system had been tweaked accordingly			1
but instead of him , it was @entity5 who took position at the top of a midfield diamond behind frontmen @entity75 and @entity77			2
@entity5 is muscled off the ball by @entity11 's @entity79 during the @entity50 qualifier @entity5 gets the better of @entity11 's @entity81 to win the ball during the first half passes : 48 passing accuracy : 87.5 % duels won : 9 duels lost : 6 recovered possession : 10 tackles : 4 fouls won : 1 shots on target : 1 blocked shots : 3 chances created : 0 the early signs were encouraging , with @entity5 , bold and direct , at the centre of every @entity10 attack			1
he hustled and harried , forcing @entity98 into a mistake before rampaging across the box and firing off a shot that was blocked			0
the link - up play with @entity75 was intuitive and the captain automatically tried to locate @entity5 's intelligent runs during the opening stages			2
on the quarter - hour , @entity5 , having dropped deep again to retrieve possession , found space with a smart flick over his own head before attemptin to find @entity111			0
@entity5 , who had been one of @entity10 's few bright sparks at the @entity113 in @entity114 , featuring in all three matches , looked perfectly at home in the advanced role			1
he was close to turning in a deflected @entity77 cross and then forced a save from goalkeeper @entity120 at his near post			0
he recovered the ball on 10 occasions and recorded a passing accuracy of 87.5 per cent , which certainly is n't to be sniffed at			0
tellingly , though , he directly did n't create a chance all night			0
the longer @entity10 hammered away at the densely - packed @entity11 defence without reward , the more his influence waned			0
@entity5 and @entity75 have a chat during the early stages of the match			0
they linked well throughout the win kept @entity10 top of @entity135 with maximum points from their three matches so far @entity10 had dominated proceedings , enjoying as much as 75 per cent of the ball , and the balance shifted further in their favour when @entity11 captain @entity142 was sent off for brutally stopping @entity111 's storming run just two minutes into the second - half			1
with more space to exploit and @entity147 legs tiring , @entity10 were screaming out for extra pace to take advantage			0
@entity5 , unfortunately , was n't the man to provide it and @entity12 wisely moved to bring on first @entity152 and then @entity18			1
there were a few eyebrows raised by the fact @entity18 had felt unable to start the match but was now required to rescue it			0
but whatever his condition , the introduction of the two speedsters gave @entity10 the impetus they needed			2
@entity75 curled home the decisive free - kick and @entity10 take another step closer to @entity165 the year after next			1
@entity5 does provide an exciting option for @entity10			2
it 's just that @entity18 at the moment offers a little bit more .			0

@entity5 played at the head of @entity10 's midfield after @entity19 *colleague* @entity18 was benched with fatigue
@entity5 played well for much of the first - half but faded after the break
it required the introduction of @entity18 and @entity152 to provide @entity10 much - needed pace and impetus
@entity75 's free - kick ensured @entity10 's perfect start continued in the race the qualify for @entity50
