@entity0 has added the ability to let people add their latest @entity4 snaps to their profile			1
the firm 's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to @entity10 's site			2
@entity0 also said it had improved its mutual friends feature			1
simply open @entity0 , go to your new profile , and connect it to your @entity4 account with a single tap - your @entity0 profile will automatically start displaying your recent @entity4 photos			1
@entity0 only displays the last 34 photos , users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library			1
' you asked , we listened , ' the firm said			2
' we ’ve made some exciting new changes to your @entity0 profile including a slick , new @entity4 integration and more common friends			1
' the firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their @entity4 user name in their profile			1
' now there ’s no need to put your @entity4 handle in your profile description to tell your story ( we got sick of having to do that , too )			0
' it also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your @entity4 feed know it was part of a dating profile			0
' and in case you were wondering , @entity0 wo n’t post anything to @entity4 on your behalf or alter your existing @entity4 privacy settings			1
' @entity0 has overhauled its profile as part of the @entity4 integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests the firm has also used @entity10 to boost its ' mutual friends ' feature			1
@entity0 now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches			1
' this adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe , ' @entity0 claims			1
it is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look , expanding the number of interests people can add			0
earlier this month @entity0 rolled out ‘ @entity80 ’ , a premium service allowing people to ‘ undo ’ a like or change their location			2
a study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services			2
sixteen to 34 year - olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users , accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base			1
the study , carried out by @entity95 - based research firm @entity94 , also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location - based dating app. significantly , just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service , ' co-authors @entity102 and @entity103 said in the report			1
but now they have set a limit on the number of ‘ likes ’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100			0
when a user reaches this limit , the app tells them ‘ you ’re out of @entity116 ’ , and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again			0
but , below this clock , a big red button says ‘ @entity119 with @entity80 ’			0
a price is then shown			0
but different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts			0
it seems the prices range from around £ 1.49 a month to as high as £ 14.99 - but the reasons why are not clear			0
this means some users will pay £ 17.88 a year for @entity80 - but others , in the upper price category , will have to fork out a whopping £ 179.88 a year			2
this equates to some users inadvertently paying £ 162 more than others over the course of a year			0
speaking to @entity135 , @entity136 , vice president of communications and branding at @entity0 , told @entity135 the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release			2
' we are testing @entity80 in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally , ' she said			0
' the @entity145 is one of our test markets , so a certain portion of the population was given access to @entity80 at varying price points			0
' however , it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity			0
in addition , @entity0 has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service .			2

@entity0 only displays the last 34 photos - but users can easily see more
