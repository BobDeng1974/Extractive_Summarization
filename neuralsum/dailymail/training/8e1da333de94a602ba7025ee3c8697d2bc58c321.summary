ill - feeling towards the @entity1 supremo is palpable around the @entity33 , with a large section of their support calling for change in the dugout , despite all @entity2 has achieved in his 18 years in north @entity39			1

i want to see @entity1 do better , ' says @entity0 , who spent three years out of action before coming out of retirement to play in @entity54			1
' but @entity2 is the man for @entity1 , 100 %			1

@entity0 ( right ) on the @entity1 training ground with manager @entity2 in september 2013 ' i do not like to think of what @entity1 would be without him as manager			1
' he has spent a lot of money , and i can see that the results should be better			0
' this club ( @entity1 ) changed my life , in particularly @entity2			1

' will it ( the unbeaten season ) be repeated ? who knows , football is crazy			0
but we will be remembered			0
' the goals we scored , the way we passed the ball , it was just incredible			0
' the @entity85 " celebrate with the league trophy at the end of the 2003 - 04 season one humorous incident stands out from @entity0 ' time at @entity1 , and the @entity43 veteran is already laughing when the subject is first mentioned			1
' i have not considered doing it again , no , ' @entity0 adds , referring to the penalty routine he and @entity80 got disastrously wrong against @entity116 in 2005			2
' it was my error , but it is @entity80 that gets all the questions			0
we still laugh about that more than anything			0
' now we can laugh , but not so much then			0
there was a bit of trouble then , but now it is okay			0
' you can follow @entity127 on @entity128 @ @entity129 @entity0 and @entity80 ( right ) look confused as they mess up a penalty against @entity116 in 2005			0

@entity1 boss @entity2 has been heavily *criticised* by some fans
@entity0 says his old club would be crazy to sack @entity2
the @entity1 legend understands the concerns of the @entity27 supporters
but @entity0 points to the *aftermath* of *sir* @entity70 's @entity75 departure as an example of what can go wrong
@entity147 : @entity1 are like a pack and when *people* attack @entity2 , we come out fighting to defend our boss
