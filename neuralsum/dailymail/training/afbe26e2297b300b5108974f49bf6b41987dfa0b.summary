by @entity1 reporter published : 20:23 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 06:44 est , 7 march 2014 a murder suspect has been cleared after experts found that a supposed confession she made in a 999 call was mis - heard because of her strong regional accent			1
@entity8 , 33 , has spent weeks in custody , wrongly accused of killing an alcoholic friend who died after falling down the stairs			1
a key piece of evidence was the hysterical 999 call she made after @entity15 , 48 , fell at home in @entity17 , @entity18 , in august			1
the murder trial took place at @entity21 and @entity22 , where @entity23 , 33 , was cleared of all charges she was thought to have told the operator : ‘ i do n’t care – i pushed him down the stairs , just get someone in here			1
’ but acoustic tests showed the @entity32 actually said : ‘ i do n’t care if you say i pushed him down the stairs , just get someone in here			1
’ prosecutor @entity37 said : ‘ she was becoming increasingly agitated at the questions from the operator			1
’ the mistake occurred because the @entity18 police officer who transcribed her 999 call to the ambulance service was confused by her strong scouse accent			1
social workers told @entity47 that mr @entity15 had previously made false complaints of being assaulted to explain drunken falls			1
forensic tests also showed that a head injury was probably caused when he hit a radiator at the bottom of the stairs rather than by a blow before he fell			2
@entity15 had fallen at his home in @entity57 , and the local ambulance services were thought to have heard a criminal confession miss @entity8 was arrested after 48 - year - old mr @entity15 died from injuries he suffered in a fall down the stairs in his home in @entity63 , @entity17 , @entity18 , in august last year			1
she has always denied playing any part in the accident , which happened when mr @entity15 was more than four times over the drink drive limit			2
he had one leg longer than the other as a result of suffering serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1983 and was often unstable on his feet because he chose not to wear a caliper on his leg			0
he had also become a chronic alcoholic who had been drinking heavily before his fatal fall , @entity47 was told			2
@entity8 , of @entity17 , denied murder and was found not guilty by judge @entity80 , @entity81 , after the prosecution offered no evidence and withdrew the case			1
she appeared by video link from @entity87 prison in @entity88 where she has been held for the past week after being arrested for alleged breach of bail conditions			0
the judge ordered she should be freed immediately			0
mr @entity37 , @entity81 , prosecuting , said mr @entity15 's family had been informed of the decision to halt the case			2
he said : ' the deceased mr @entity15 was aged 48 at the time of his death and had suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1983 which left him with a weakness down one side of his body and his right leg significantly shorter than his left			1
@entity17 is a market town and civil parish in the @entity106 of @entity18 , @entity107 on the @entity108 ' he was supposed to wear calipers to assist his gait and balance but frequently did not do so			2
' unfortunately , living with his ongoing difficulties and the effect of his injury , led him to drink to excess and he became an alcoholic			0
' the defendant was staying at his home on the night of august 12 to 13 last year and in the morning of the 13th the deceased fell down the stairs and suffered a head injury from which he died five days later			1
' the prosecution case was that miss @entity8 had struck him on the back of the head or pushed him so as to propel him down the stairs			1
the defence was he lost balance and fell and it was an accident			2
' there were two strands of evidence			0
the first was what mr @entity15 said to the paramedics before they took him to hospital , which was the only account he gave because he was put into a medically induced coma at @entity136 and did not regain consciousness			2
' in response to direct question when the paramedics arrived he said he had not been assaulted and had just fallen down the stairs			0
' the paramedic pressed him , principally because his control had wrongly informed him that a knife was involved			0
' he continued to question mr @entity146 with a great deal of persistence and in the end he said he had been hit on the head before he fell			0
' @entity151 have to assess the reliability of that account and inquiries were made with social support workers and those who looked after him for social services			0
' it became clear he frequently fell over and on occasions said he sustained the injuries from being attacked but the social workers said that was not the case and he had said out of embarrassment to make an excuse			0
' the other aspect is the 999 call during which miss @entity8 was emotional and hysterical and gave an account that was difficult to understand because of her very strong accent and was originally interpreted as her saying she did not care if she did push him down the stairs			1
' police sent the tape to an acoustic expert who used specialist equipment which enabled them clarify what she said			0
' it is clear she was becoming increasingly agitated at the questions from the operator and what she said was " i do n't care if you say i pushed him down the stairs , just get someone in here "			1
' the deceased suffered a laceration to the back of his head and the pathological evidence is that he could have been hit or that he had hit his head on a radiator at the foot of the stairs on which his blood was found			0
' the suggestion that he lost his balance and suffered an accident is plausible			0
he had a very high blood alcohol level of 328 milligrams per 100 millilitres			0
' his drinking habits may have given him a significant tolerance but the view of the experts is that nevertheless this level of alcohol would have impaired his balance and coordination			0
' he had a history of losing his balance when in drink and the @entity21 take the view there is no realistic prospect of conviction			0
' miss @entity8 , of @entity17 , denied murder and was found not guilty after prosecutors withdrew their case .			2

@entity8 , 33 , spent weeks in custody after being wrongly accused
she was falsely accused of the murder of @entity15 , 48 , who fell at home
she was thought to have told the ambulance service operator : ‘ i do n’t care – i pushed him down the stairs , just get someone in here . ’
the mistake occurred because the @entity18 police officer who transcribed her 999 call to the ambulance service was confused by her strong scouse accent .
