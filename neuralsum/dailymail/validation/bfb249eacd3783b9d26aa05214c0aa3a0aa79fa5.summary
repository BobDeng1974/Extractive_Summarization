a multi-million - pound office building just off @entity1 has been taken over by anarchist squatters			1
around 50 people are currently living in the former offices of the @entity5 on @entity6 in central @entity7 after moving in on friday night			1
the self - proclaimed ' @entity8 ' today vowed to stay put for ' as long as possible ' in the building , not far from @entity10 , which they targeted because it was originally opened by @entity12			1
although they have already received a court summons , they ignored the document and did not attend the legal hearing			2
the property has ashtrays and drinks glasses strewn across the floor , while half - eaten in what appear to be @entity40 and co-op bags have been piled up in rooms			0
the anarchists say that they have not done any permanent damage to the building , designed by @entity47 architect @entity46 , apart from vandalising the plaque which records mr @entity12 opening the premises in 2001			1
the building is currently on the market with estate agent @entity52 after being vacated several months ago by the @entity5 , which used it as an annexe to its main headquarters a few doors away			1
food : half - eaten meals in what appeared to be @entity40 and co-op bags were seen in a corner of the squat vandalised : this plaque recording the opening of the building by @entity12 was defaced by the squatters posters : the @entity70 advert was defaced , while another poster showed the heads of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 on stakes hallway : a welcome table appeared to have been set up at the bottom of the stairs in the building mockery : one of the anti-capitalist messages painted on a poster in the window one squatter , 28 - year - old @entity86 , who was previously jailed for assaulting a police officer during an anti-capitalist protester , said that the group intended to take care of the building			1
referring to the mess on the floor , he said : ' we do clean up after ourselves every morning - we just have n't had the chance to do it yet			0
' when we leave they will get the building back in pretty much the same condition in which we found it in			2
' he added : ' we call ourselves @entity8			0
we all have different views			0
some are here to make a political point , but some are not			0
' but the main point for us all is that there are million , even billion , pound properties standing empty and i think it is disgusting that these buildings are left empty when there is a housing crisis going on in @entity7			0
message : a protester known as @entity118 writes out a sign to be put in the window cheery : one message simply said ' have a nice day ' in contrast to other more aggressive posters washing up : this morning the squatters claimed they had not yet had time to do the cleaning claim : the squatters say they have a legal right to be in the building and have ignored a court summons aggressive : some posters declared ' class war ' and ' the working class strikes back ' ' we have a wide range of people here - chefs , caterers , law and politics students , and even an aspiring model - with an age range from about 18 to 60			1
' @entity86 claimed the building 's link with mr @entity12 was one reason the squatters moved in			1
' we just saw it was empty and decided to take it , ' he said			0
' it is a massive building to be empty , and we could see that plaque through the door - the building was opened by @entity12 who is a war criminal and has blood on his hands , so we decided to take it			1
' some of the posters in the window proclaim an apparently violent message - one has a picture of @entity73 , @entity75 and @entity74 's heads on spike , with the words : ' the only cuts we want to see			0
' another shows a picture of a cemetery captioned ' we have found new homes for the rich			0
' @entity170 : one poster made a reference to the late anti-war protester @entity173 , who lived in @entity174 contraband : a police hat appeared to be hanging from a coathook in the office building celebration : a squatter draped in the @entity182 flag in an apparent homage to @entity184 the squatters say they will stay ' as long as possible ' , but do not yet know how long they will be able to remain			1
' we took it on friday and already by sunday we had a notice asking us to go to court , but i do n't think anybody went , ' @entity86 said			2
although the property still has electricity and running water , the squatters insist they are not stealing the utilities			2
a spokesman for the @entity5 , which represents the interests of company directors , said that the institute has had no link to the property since moving out			1
he added : ' we do n't mind a good strong , serious , debate - even if we do n't agree with the squatters with a lot of things - and they are entitled to their opinion			2
' we vacated this building six months ago , but there ’s a chance there are some old @entity212 or @entity213 books left behind			2
who knows , perhaps they ’ll learn something			0
' the @entity217 said they were unable to act unless they received a complaint from the landlord			0
a spokesman for @entity70 did not respond to a request for comment .			0
