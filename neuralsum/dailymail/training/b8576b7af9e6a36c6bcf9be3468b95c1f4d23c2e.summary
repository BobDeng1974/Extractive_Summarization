in a blog post on the @entity10 website , chief technology officer @entity52 , said : ' the vulnerability allows malicious applications to impersonate specially recognised trusted applications without any user notification			2
' this is a widespread vulnerability dating back to the january 2010 release of @entity4 2.1			1
mr @entity52 also suggested the malware could gain access to ' financial and payment data by impersonating @entity41 ' , an app which utilises mobile payments , leaving thousands of user accounts at risk			1
however , @entity5 has moved to calm any fears by confirming they have been alerted to the problem and issued a fix to protect users			1

' probably not many people will already be affected by the flaw			0
security flaws do go unnoticed by companies but that usually means they go unnoticed by hackers as well			0
