by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 feels he has proven after two of the toughest weeks of his @entity5 career he is not a driver to crack under pressure			1
it was after a poor error of judgement in qualifying for the @entity12 @entity11 that gave @entity13 team - mate and title rival @entity15 pole position sir @entity16 suggested @entity2 's head ' had gone a bit '			1
but in the wake of shocking bad luck in qualifying for the last two races in @entity25 and @entity26 that placed @entity2 's back against the wall , the 29 - year - old came out fighting and conjured two astonishing drives			1
i 'll drink to that : @entity2 finished third in sunday 's race despite starting from the pit lane challenger : he is up against @entity13 team - mate @entity15 for the 2014 title in @entity40 , following a brake disc failure that pitched him into a 30g impact into a tyre barrier , @entity2 powered his way to third from 20th on the grid			1
at the @entity45 , a fuel leak caused a fire that wrecked his car , and given the damage and subsequent re-build he was forced to start from the pit lane			0
a spin on lap one in wet conditions only compounded @entity2 's woes , yet in the face of adversity he again rose to third			2
there was also controversy as he was asked to move aside for @entity15 at one stage , with the duo on different strategies			2
@entity2 refused , which proved crucial as he managed to keep @entity15 behind him in the dying moments of the 70 - lap race when the @entity25 was on a charge on fresh tyres			1
given @entity2 's gross misfortune so far this season , as he has also suffered two retirements to @entity15 's one , it is no wonder he can not wait to recharge his batteries			1
' it 's been a very trying , challenging and testing last two weeks , and to be able to still keep myself together ... , ' said @entity2			2
' i saw one story that i would crack under the pressure , well these last two weeks have shown that 's not the case , that i 'm still in the fight and raring to go			2
' this break will be good for me now to re-energise , get fit , and with the car lighter ( in the absence of the @entity86 suspension system ) i can maybe put some weight on and come back stronger , both physically and mentally			0
' back to the wall : @entity2 came from the back of the grid to finish third in @entity26 overtake : @entity2 on the shoulder of @entity92 before then , however , there are clear - the - air talks to be held with @entity15 , @entity13 motorsport boss @entity95 and executive technical director @entity96 , whose suggestion it was for @entity2 to yield			1
@entity2 knows to have done so , when both he and @entity15 were still in with a chance of the win on lap 51 when the call was made , would almost certainly have damaged his championship chances			2
going into the break with eight races remaining , @entity2 now trails @entity15 by just 11 points			1
a far from happy @entity15 has made it clear he feels @entity2 was in the wrong as he said : ' @entity2 did n't let me by , although he was ordered to so , so that 's obviously not good and we need to discuss that internally			1
' that 's the best way forward for us as a team			0
it 's pretty obvious what happened , it was all on the radio			0
' so we need to discuss it , we will discuss it , and we will see how we move forward			0
' blow : @entity15 was leading sunday 's @entity121 until the deployment of the safety car holding station : @entity2 ignored a direct team order from the pit wall to let @entity15 through asked as to whether he felt he would have won the race , @entity15 said : ' that 's so theoretical			1
i do n't know ...			0
ah , no , no , no , let 's go by what @entity95 said ( that @entity15 could have )			0
' he 's looked at all the data and things like that , so let 's go by his opinion			0
he 's the best person to know that			0
' @entity15 , however , bristled when he was questioned on whether if roles had been reversed he would have done the same for @entity2			2
' i 'm sorry that 's not something that 's relevant now to discuss , ' snapped @entity15			0
' it 's hypothetical , theoretical , it 's not relevant			0

@entity2 feels he is not going to crack under pressure of @entity5 title battle
he has *secured* two *podiums* in last two races both from the back of grid
finished ahead of @entity15 in @entity26 amid controversy surrounding team orders
