by @entity0 demands : it was alleged that @entity3 demanded @entity5 minority status in return for another policy the decision to recognise the @entity5 as a minority group was the result of ‘ petty ’ horse - trading over policies between the coalition parties , senior @entity8 claimed last night			1
amid deepening tensions , it was claimed the @entity17 minister @entity3 - one of @entity19 ’s closest allies – demanded the move in return for signing off another policy			1
the @entity17 are said to have refused to agree to reforms of town hall pensions , which could save taxpayers up to £ 600million a year , unless the @entity27 announcement was made			1
cornish people were granted the same rights and protections as other ‘ national minorities ’ in the surprise move last month			1
@entity17 chief secretary to the treasury @entity33 unveiled the plan on a visit to @entity36			0
it appeared to be part of an effort by the to shore up faltering support in the @entity41 , traditionally one of the party ’s strongholds			0
the claim that it was part of yet more ‘ horse - trading ’ will add to growing concern among senior @entity8 that government is being reduced to ‘ transactional ’ deal - making with their coalition colleagues			1
last night a @entity51 source identified mr @entity3 as a significant problem for relations between the two parties			1
conservative ministers did not disagree with the proposal for @entity27 , but thought it bizarre that mr @entity3 apparently sought to link it to a major austerity measure			1
‘ you can do a deal with @entity33 [ @entity33 ]			2
he will do what he says he ’s going to do			0
but i have never come across a more tricky politician than @entity3 , ’ said the @entity51 source			1
‘ you would n’t believe the horse - trading that we have to do and how silly some of the gimmicks that they want are			2
’ @entity8 cabinet ministers are rallying to the support of education secretary @entity71 , who has been embroiled in increasingly bitter public disputes with the @entity17 in recent weeks			1
yesterday the @entity73 revealed mr @entity19 twice suggested police should be brought in to investigate damaging leaks about his plans to extend free school meals , which he blamed on @entity78 – a former senior aide to mr @entity71			2
deal : the @entity81 are now a minority under an @entity84 convention , and the @entity5 language receives state funding ministers insist problems are not limited to mr @entity71 ’s department , but are increasingly happening elsewhere			2
one example , the source said , was the @entity93 ’s bid to make vital savings in the management of town hall pensions			0
ministers agreed to bring in a bank or actuarial firm to cut huge administration costs , which vary greatly across almost 90 local government retirement schemes			0
but the @entity17 insisted on the @entity5 announcement in exchange for agreeing to the reforms , the source claimed			1
the @entity81 have been afforded the status of a national minority , made under a @entity108 convention			0
only 557 people claim @entity5 is their main language , but teaching of the dialect is receiving government funding			0
it emerged yesterday mr @entity19 has asked cabinet secretary sir @entity115 , to issue a formal warning to mr @entity78 about his duty of confidentiality			0
