@entity1 manager @entity0 has warned goalkeeper @entity2 that he faces a battle to keep his place from new signing @entity5 this season			1
@entity0 must decide who to play in sunday ’s @entity9 against @entity10 at @entity11 after acknowledging that he now has ‘ two no 1 goalkeepers ’			1
@entity13 , a £ 6million signing from @entity0 ’s old club @entity15 , has primarily been brought in as back - up for @entity2 but on the understanding that he will offer more of a challenge to the @entity21 goalkeeper than the departed @entity22			1
safe ? @entity2 has been warned that he faces a battle to keep his place in @entity1 's starting line - up the 32 - year - old @entity26 played in the majority of games on @entity1 ’s pre-season tour of @entity30 while @entity2 recovered after the @entity31 , and has made no secret of his desire to become first - choice at the @entity34			1
@entity0 , who dropped @entity2 for seven @entity36 games at the end of last year due to a loss of form , said : ‘ i will make the decision who will start — not only the goalkeeper , the whole team			1
‘ i have two @entity45 goalkeepers , i have two no 1 full backs , right and left , and in other positions			1
‘ @entity5 has settled in very well			0
i know him from @entity15 and he ’s a very good goalkeeper			0
that is why i say we have a stronger squad than last year			0
i ’m sure @entity5 will be very important for us , but i also continue thinking we have the best goalkeeper in @entity21 in @entity2			2
‘ top teams need two players for each position because we have to play so many games during the year			0
when we finish the season i can tell you if he ( @entity2 ) has had more or less opposition			2
’ sticks : @entity0 must decide who to play in sunday ’s @entity9 against @entity10 at @entity11 @entity1 ’s remaining @entity31 contingent — captain @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 — are not fit enough yet to play in the traditional curtain - raiser and some may struggle to be ready for next weekend ’s opening @entity36 game at @entity73			1
however , it is understood that the @entity36 champions are on the brink of making their fourth signing of the summer with confirmation of @entity80 ’s £ 32m move from @entity81 said to be imminent			1
@entity80 ’s arrival will coincide with @entity84 ’s departure to @entity85 after @entity1 agreed a £ 12m fee and £ 800,000 in add - ons based on the @entity90 club ’s success in @entity91			1
@entity80 ’s former @entity81 team - mate @entity92 , who joined @entity1 from the @entity94 club for £ 12m earlier this summer , is sure the @entity95 will make an impact			0
‘ i ’ve played with him for a long time , he ’s a great player and a friend as well , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s very quick and strong , very competitive			0
new boy : @entity2 faces stiff competition from new @entity1 signing @entity5 ( pictured ) @entity13 in action durin @entity1 's pre-season friendly against @entity104 in the @entity30 ‘ with his characteristics , he might bring an element to the team that @entity1 does n’t have			1
’ @entity92 will challenge fellow @entity108 @entity67 for a defensive midfield role this season and , like @entity13 , is determined to fight for a first - team place			2
the 27 - year - old watched @entity114 ’s humbling 7 - 1 defeat to @entity115 at the @entity31 — a match in which @entity67 was replaced at half - time — and when asked if he could have reinforced the team answers ‘ naturally ’			2
he added : ‘ i have a very strong defensive game and that is going to help us a lot because teams will take advantage of @entity1 being so attacking , on the counter-attack			0
i ’m going to add very good value in that sense			0
on the move ? @entity84 ( above ) look set for a £ 12million move to @entity85 coming in : @entity80 ’s ( above ) £ 32million move from @entity81 said to be imminent ‘ there are some great players here but i know my strengths and will work hard to make sure i ’m first choice			1
’ although @entity92 will compete with @entity67 for a place , they might also play together , which would present a problem for commentators			0
city team - mates have already devised a way to differentiate			2
‘ i think they ’re calling @entity143 ” and me “ @entity145 ” , ’ he said			0
@entity92 was speaking at @entity1 ’s @entity9 media day at @entity147 , where he helped the club ’s community coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs in a free soccer school			2
battle : @entity92 ( above ) will challenge fellow @entity108 @entity67 for a defensive midfield role this season			0
