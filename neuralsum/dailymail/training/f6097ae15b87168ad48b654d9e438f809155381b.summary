by @entity0 a teenager who was terrified of becoming ‘ a hunchback ’ because of her misshapen spine has achieved her dream of becoming a model			2
@entity6 , 18 , suffers from severe scoliosis which makes her spine curved			1
the schoolgirl would spend hours in front of a mirror attempting to improve her posture			0
it caused her severe pain when she moved and she feared she would end up in a wheelchair when she was diagnosed with the condition at 16 , doctors told her she would need a 12 - hour operation and she feared it would end her dreams of becoming a successful model			1
scoliosis causes the spine to excessively curve sideways			1
the condition affects around four per cent of the population and if left untreated it can lead to fatal heart and lung problems			0
current treatment techniques centre on having major operations , which are risky procedures involving metal rods being inserted either side of the spine			1
doctors told @entity6 that she would need a risky 12 - hour operation to correct the curvature in her spine ( pictured ) but she refused to have the surgery as she thought it would end her chances of being a model instead , she turned to a non-surgical treatment to improve her condition , and has stunned medics with her remarkable progress			1
@entity6 of @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ‘ it was awful how much time i would spend crying and i was terrified of what would happen to me when i was first diagnosed			1
‘ i was paranoid i would end up looking awful and would end up in a wheelchair			2
’ @entity6 , who often modelled in fashion catalogues , has a double s - shaped curved spine			1
@entity6 has now found relief from the pain in her back by doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around her spine she first noticed aching pains when she was 14 , but put them down to growing pains			1
it was only when she started to suffer agonising sharp pains during photo shoots that she mentioned it to her mother and went to see her gp			0
she was told by a consultant she would need surgery but instead discovered a clinic called @entity72 on the internet			0
the idea is that various exercises can strengthen the muscles surrounding the spine , stabilising the condition			1
@entity6 said : ‘ i was ecstatic and i could n’t wait to start the treatment			1
i think everyone should consider exercise before putting themselves through a risky operation			1
‘ i could feel the difference in my back after the first few days , and i could see the difference			0
‘ as long as i keep up with the exercises i should n’t suffer from pain and my scoliosis should stabilise			1
i feel like i am back in control again			0
’ ' i lost interest in everything and i had no quality of life at all			0
i had gone from being really confident in my body to wanting to hide away at every opportunity			0
as long as i keep up with the exercises i should n’t suffer from pain and my scoliosis should stabilise			1
i feel like i am back in control again ' - @entity6 the condition is likely to get worse , but @entity6 has thrown herself back into modelling regardless			1
she said : ‘ i am so happy now - it 's remarkable how far i have come			0
i was in constant pain on a daily basis and my whole world had fallen apart			0
‘ i lost interest in everything and i had no quality of life at all			0
i had gone from being really confident in my body to wanting to hide away at every opportunity			0
‘ i feel i can now finally look forward			0
’ a spokesman for @entity72 said : ‘ @entity6 decided our treatment could not do any harm and if it worked it could change her life			2
‘ within weeks of being on the course , @entity6 ’s condition dramatically improved			2
she was no longer lying awake at night with pain and her confidence soared			2
‘ since completing her treatment , @entity6 has returned home and has been able to shop and feel confident in her clothes again for the first time in months			1
‘ she has regained all of her passion for life and has bounced back to her normal , fit and sociable self			0
she has also re-started her modelling career and is very excited about what the future holds			1
’ scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an s - shape			1
signs include a visible curve in the spine , one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other , clothes not handing properly and back pain			2
@entity143 usually only affects adults with the condition			0
in most cases , the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy			2
in the @entity152 , scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000			0
it is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis			2
it is more common in women than in men			0
most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows			0
however , in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing			0
occasionally , a child needs surgery to straighten their spine			1
in adults , it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain			2

@entity6 , 18 , has scoliosis which makes her spine s - shaped
it caused her severe pain every time she moved and *damaged* her confidence
doctors said she *'d* need a risky 12 - hour operation to straighten her spine
turned down the surgery as she thought it would end her modelling career
instead , she found relief in exercises *specially* *designed* to strengthen the muscles around her spine
