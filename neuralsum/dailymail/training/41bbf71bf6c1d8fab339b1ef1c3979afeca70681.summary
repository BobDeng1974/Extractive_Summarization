@entity2 's @entity1 100 metres champion @entity0 insists athletes can not afford to be distracted by the doping allegations engulfing their sport			1
a programme broadcast by @entity8 tv station @entity7 revealed allegations of systematic doping and cover - ups in @entity12 and it was announced on tuesday that @entity14 , the hard - hitting former president of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , would head an independent three - man commission investigating the damaging claims			1
@entity19 's event has been tainted by doping , with the fastest man in the world in 2014 , @entity20 , a two - time drug cheat			1
@entity23 , the second fastest man in history , returned to the track this summer after a reduced one - year suspension , while former world record holder @entity27 also came back to competition after his enforced absence for testing positive for a banned stimulant			2
@entity0 hopes @entity32 athletes can not afford to be distracted by doping allegations on @entity20 , @entity0 said : ' the sport has allowed him back in , he 's served his time and he 's come back			1
all you can do is just get on with it and train and control what you can control as an athlete in your performances			2
' i think i raced him once and i think he said , ' good luck ' to me or something like that , but apart from that i did n't really converse with him			0
' asked about the latest drug scandal to hit the sport , @entity0 added : ' i 'm just an athlete , i just focus on myself , focus on competing , focus on training and that 's all we can do as athletes - as opposed to focusing on the politics within the sport			1
that 's a distraction , you can only focus on yourself			0
' i 'm pretty sure the sport will be cleaned up and all things will be good eventually			0
' @entity19 's training partner @entity59 , one of a crop of exciting young @entity32 women sprinters , said : ' if we 're worrying if ( other competitors ) are on drugs , that means they are affecting us , they will be draining our energy and we would n't be concentrating on what we came to a championships to do			1
' @entity69 has joined @entity19 's @entity71 - based training group under @entity72 and both athletes will compete at the @entity74 in @entity75 in february , with the @entity76 taking place in @entity78 the following month			2
@entity2 's @entity19 wins the men 's 100m final during day two of the 2014 @entity81 in @entity82 the @entity75 meeting is the same one at which @entity19 earlier this year suffered the hamstring injury which ruled him out of the @entity87 and denied him the chance to compete at the @entity90			0
but the 27 - year - old , whose career has been hampered by injury , said he was not taking a risk with his fitness by doing another indoor season			0
' there is no risk at all , i believe i am over my injuries and that 's that , ' said @entity0 , who added that a decision had yet to be made over whether he would compete in @entity78			1
' ( my fitness ) been very consistent this winter , i 've had no hiccups			0
' the @entity106 is also hopeful of playing a greater role in the 4x100m relay team next year , having not been part of the quartet which won gold at the @entity112 in @entity82 in august , despite being the individual 100m champion			0
@entity114 has replaced @entity115 in charge of the relay programme			0
' i was always involved with the squad , i just unfortunately never got the opportunity to run , but i definitely will be involved with the relay ( in 2015 ) , ' @entity0 added			1
' as a team , bringing in the additions of myself , i 'm sure we 'll be able to contend for global medals now			0
' : : watch the world 's best athletes compete at the @entity74 on saturday 21 february			2
