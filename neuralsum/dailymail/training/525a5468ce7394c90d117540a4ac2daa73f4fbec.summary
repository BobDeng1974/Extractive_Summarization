imagine having an entire galaxy named after you			1
that 's exactly what happened to one amateur star gazer after he spotted a new galaxy as part of an online search for the @entity9			2
the galaxy , discovered by @entity11 , has been named @entity12 after his nickname was misheard by a television producer on the @entity16 programme			1
@entity17 was the first person to identify a unique galaxy 10 billion light years away from @entity18			1
he is pictured here with his telescope in his observatory mr @entity11 , 60 , was stunned when he found out that a blurry spec he spotted in an online search was a cluster of stars , gas and matter from a distant world			1
he said he felt like he had ' won the lottery ' after discovering the new galaxy 10 billion light years from @entity18			1
the service engineer from @entity31 , @entity32 , spotted the image of light from the galaxy being bent by gravity			2
incredibly , as the universe is estimated to be 13 billion years old it means his discovery is one of the nearest to the the @entity41 ever captured by an amateur			1
the galaxy discovered by @entity11 has been named @entity12 after his nickname was misheard by a @entity9 television producer @entity45 ' @entity44 ' @entity11 made his discovery as part of an online search led by the @entity9 's @entity16 programme			1
the show recently launched a @entity51 2 project asking amateur astronomers to find galaxies so massive that they warp space and time			2
in general relativity , the presence of matter ( energy density ) can curve space time , and the path of a light ray will be deflected as a result			0
this process is called gravitational lensing scientists on the project are asking amateur star gazers to visually inspect astronomical in the hope they can find this ' gravitational lensing ' phenomenon			2
and despite scientists initially wanting to name the new star - system after @entity72 it was named after mr @entity11 after being backed by professor @entity74			1
the amazing image - which captures the notion of gravity lensing - has since since caught the attention of observatories around the world			0
mr @entity11 said : ' the object at the front is two billion light - years away , and the object that just happens to be directly behind it , is another eight billion light - years away			1
' given the universe is only 13 billion years old , it means this object at 10 billion light years away is quite near the beginning of the universe			1
' i was one of six people in the world who spotted the image			0
' but apparently i was the first			0
it is very rare to get a perfect ring from these lensed objects , normally they are a crescent on one side			0
' i have an observatory in my garden at home , and what interests me is deep space objects			0
' people know you have to have a " clear sky " , but for what i 'm looking for it has to be very clear			0
@entity17 , a service engineer , captured an image of light from the galaxy being bent by gravity from his back garden in @entity31 , @entity32 ' that 's why when i saw the appeal for help with this on - line project looking for deep space objects , i thought i 'd give it a go			1
' to have some of the largest telescopes in the world looking at it , i realised it must be something very interesting			0
' i 've never won the @entity125 , but i imagine this is what it feels like			0
' the father - of - two made the amazing discovery as part of an online search led by the @entity9 's @entity16 programme			0
scientists involved with the programme used the @entity136 radio telescope at @entity137 to look at the object and phoned observatories in the @entity140 , and @entity141 to get more data on it			0
@entity45 ' @entity44 ' @entity11 made the discovery of the new galaxy as part of an online search led by the @entity9 's @entity16 programme			2
the show is hosted by professor @entity74 ( left ) and @entity148 ( right ) but the galaxy discovered by mr @entity150 - who is also known as ' @entity44 ' - was named @entity12 after his nickname was misheard by a television producer			1
mr @entity11 added : ' the producers had asked my name and nickname , but they must have misheard @entity44 as @entity156 because that 's what appeared on the screen , so people were suggesting @entity12 as the object 's name			1
' gravitational lensing was used to prove @entity72 's general theory of relativity			0
' and when they asked the public for names on the tv that was among those suggested			0
' it was down to @entity171 and @entity12 and i thought it would go to @entity72			2
' but then professor @entity74 said it should be named after me to highlight amateur astronomy			2
' i guess it 's lucky in a way as @entity156 was far more likely to be used then @entity177 - it 's much more snappier			0

@entity180 was discovered by 60 - year - old engineer @entity11
it was named @entity12 after his nickname was misheard by a tv producer
as the universe is estimated to be 13 billion years old , this galaxy is one of the nearest to the the @entity41 ever found by an amateur
