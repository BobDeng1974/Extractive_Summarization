by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 10:19 est , 1 december 2012 education chiefs say the growing trend of parents hiring private tutors to coach their children through the 11 - plus is giving an unfair advantage to middle - class pupils			1
@entity9 wants to introduce a new ' tutor - proof ' version of the exam designed to stop the children of more affluent parents dominating the intake at the county 's top selective schools			1
the authority conducted a review amid concerns the exam was too ' coachable ' , meaning clever children from working - class families were being squeezed out			2
advantage : the children of middle - class parents who can afford to pay for private tuition have an unfair advantage , education chiefs have said youngsters in @entity9 who pass the exam , which they sit in their final year of primary school , have the option of applying to attend one of the county 's many selective , grammar schools			1
grammar schools - of which there are more than 30 in @entity9 - are among the best in the country but do not charge fees			2
this is in contrast to independent schools , the most prestigious of which charge annual fees of up to £ 30,000			0
the 11 - plus is designed to test pupils ' innate ability , but research has shown 28 per cent of parents across the country hire a home tutor for their child , according to a report in @entity55			1
in @entity57 and the @entity58 the figure rose to 35 per cent , with parents spending an average £ 3,800 per child per year on private tuition			0
concerns : @entity9 wants to see a test that is less ' coachable ' than the current 11 - plus @entity9 's education spokesman @entity64 told the newspaper local headteachers had expressed concerns about the 11 - plus , which is administered by the authority			1
' i would like to see a test that is less coachable than the current one , ' he said			0
' it does n't seem right that those who can afford to have their children coached can gain an advantage in a test over those less well off			0
' mr @entity64 said the council was preparing to consult further with head teachers , with a view to introducing a new scheme by 2014			0
but critics said the notion of a ' tutor - proof ' test was almost impossible , and questioned the likelihood of developing an exam for which there could be no coaching .			0

education chiefs in @entity9 fear use of home tutors gives an unfair advantage to middle - classes
@entity9 said use of private tutoring *ahead* of the 11 - plus is now so *widespread* it is *distorting* *results*
