it is not the first new species to be named after characters from the @entity4 films			1
even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business , those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names			0
in 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm @entity90 after the @entity92 knight from @entity4 - @entity35			1
professor @entity25 ( pictured above on the right with student @entity94 left ) named the new species of catfish after his favourite character from the @entity4 films that he watched as a young boy @entity10 ( shown above ) has bug - eyes , bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth there is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as @entity105			1

two other new species - @entity10 ephippiata and @entity137 - were found alongside it			2
he said : ' in biology , taxonomy is probably the most important science			0
' we have not even completed cataloging all of the species found locally , and in places like @entity147 , it sometimes feels like we have barely started			0
' we need names to be able to discuss anything about the biology of the organisms , and it is the one branch of biology used by every biologist alive			0
' the purple deep sea worm above was named @entity90 , after the @entity92 knight from the @entity4 films the trapdoor spider above was named @entity114 , after the sarlacc monster in @entity116			1
