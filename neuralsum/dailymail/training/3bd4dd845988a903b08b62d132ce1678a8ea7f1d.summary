an auto shop worker has built an upside down truck that looks like a flipped - over vehicle			1
@entity3 spent six months and $ 6,000 building the upside down truck from the parts of two separate vehicles in the car workshop he runs in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the road - legal car is created from a 1991 @entity12 pickup truck with a 1995 f - 150 pickup truck body placed over the top - but upside down with the wheels pointed towards the sky			1
@entity3 designed the upside down truck from the parts of two separate vehicles , a 1991 @entity12 pickup truck with a 1995 f - 150 pickup truck , in the workshop he runs with his wife @entity21 in @entity8 , @entity9 mr @entity3 says when he first saw a @entity22 on its roof in his garage he thought it would be interesting on the road it is designed to look like a red and white @entity22 pickup truck knocked on to its roof - complete with spinning tyres and a license plate that reads ' @entity32 '			1
mr @entity3 and his wife @entity21 run a collision centre in @entity9 where he built the creation			2
he got the idea for the subverted truck when he was called to transport an overturned @entity12 to his body shop			1
when he saw the @entity22 on its roof with four wheels sticking up in the air , he thought it would look interesting travelling down the road			0
mr @entity3 said : ' i built the truck by starting out collecting parts for a @entity47 , we bought different parts in different locations			2
the bare bones of @entity3 's pickup truck ( pictured ) which forms half of the unusual vehicle he designed the 1991 @entity12 pickup truck ( pictured below ) is joined with the 1995 f - 150 body placed on top ( above ) ' then on the drive train it is a 91 @entity12 that i bought complete			1
we tore the body off of it and transformed the @entity47 upside down on to the 91 @entity12			2
' the vehicle attracts attention wherever it goes , causing drivers to stare and pedestrians to stop in the road			0
mr @entity3 estimated that a thousand pictures of the car are taken every day it is on the road			2
mr @entity3 is out on the road in @entity8 with his dog @entity70 and the ' @entity72 ' license plate is clearly seen mr @entity3 pulls over the unusualy upturned pick - up truck - which he says causes people to stop in the street ' there 's no blueprint - i just started buying parts and then putting it together			1
' it 's all in my head and we had to make adjustments throughout , but it turned out pretty much like i envisioned it			0
' people are amazed , it 's one of those things when you first see it , it 's hard to recognise what it is but when you take the second look then they want to pull me over and take a closer look at it			0
' mr @entity3 did n't tell his wife @entity21 he was building the truck until it was finished - when he took it to the dealership where she works to surprise her			1
ms @entity104 said : ' he just showed up at my job and called me to come outside			0
i went outside and saw this incredible creation			0
' people were stopping in the street and it was a lot of fun			0
' @entity3 is car crazy and his mind is always thinking about what the next project is going to be			0

@entity3 spent six months and $ 6,000 to build his ' topsy turvy ' truck
vehicle with ' @entity32 ' license plate made from a 1991 @entity12 pickup
