by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 02:12 est , 18 june 2013 double - edged sword : stress sets off eczema , so it is doubly cruel that @entity5 works in an industry that demands perfect looks stripping off for an intimate scene in a tv show that will be watched by millions would be nerve - racking for any actress			1
but for @entity11 , star of the recent @entity13 drama @entity14 , showing some skin was nothing less than ' mortifying ' - because she suffers from severe eczema all over her body			1
' it was a nightmare because i felt so self - conscious , and we were outside , so my hay fever was set off , too , ' says @entity5			1
' but we just laughed about it and i 'm so pleased i did it now			0
' thanks to expert make - up both on and off screen , you 'd never guess that @entity5 suffers with eczema , a condition causing patches of itchy , red , dry and cracked skin			1
but the 30 - year - old actress , best known for starring in soap opera hollyoaks , has had it all her life			0
' when i was born i came out covered in eczema , ' she says			2
' my mum and dad had it , but theirs was less serious			0
' my earliest memories are of having long baths in emollient and wearing mittens all the time to stop me scratching			0
the itchiness drove me crazy			0
i still scratch myself in my sleep , sometimes so much that it bleeds			0
' throughout her teens , @entity5 was highly self - conscious about her eczema , and despite laughing about it good - naturedly at school , she would weep to her mother at night			1
so she sometimes finds it hard to believe she grew up to be an actress , confident enough to bare all for the cameras			0
one in five children and one in 12 adults lives with eczema , a condition triggered by inflammation , says dr @entity61 , a leading dermatologist and spokesperson for the @entity63			2
' there are various forms , but the most common is atopic eczema , which is inherited through genes that carry eczema , hay fever and asthma			2
so it may be that one or both parents have one of these conditions but they produce a child with eczema			2
' the condition is caused when the immune system over-reacts to harmless allergens , setting up a process of inflammation which causes the distinctive red , itchy patches of skin , often on the insides of elbows and knees			1
experts agree that eczema is probably caused by a combination of an inherited predisposition and environmental triggers			2
worryingly , the number of cases in the @entity95 has increased dramatically			0
' eczema has become hugely prevalent - there 's been about a threefold rise in the past 40 years , ' says @entity99 , chief executive of the @entity100			2
' genes do n't change that fast so we suspect the culprit is modern living - we wash a lot more than we used to and use more products , and we central heat our homes and air condition our buildings			0
soap and temperature variations seem to be common triggers			0
' indeed , when @entity5 's family moved to @entity117 when she was 11 , after her mother got a job there , her eczema all but disappeared as she was n't living in such a changeable climate			1
but it returned when she came back to the @entity95 at 16			0
worrying : the number of cases of eczema in the @entity95 has increased dramatically ' unfortunately , it was around then i really started getting into acting and dancing and i felt so self - conscious wearing leotards			2
' i remember being in a play where there was lots of holding hands , and no one wanted to touch me			0
the boys would say they did n't want to lift me			0
i felt like an ogre			0
' stigma is a huge issue for eczema sufferers , says @entity99 , who has the condition herself			1
' we hear of people going to the shops and people refusing to serve them			2
' @entity5 knew she was entering an industry where looks mean everything - and cruelly , stress can exacerbate eczema , so she often suffered flare - ups just before acting jobs and auditions			1
' i remember going to see a gp when i was 21			0
i 'd had a terrible break - out and had a big audition coming up			0
she said : “ i think you should think about changing your job			0
” ' i was so upset as i was n't getting much acting work at the time			0
it was definitely my lowest point and i did think : “ what am i doing ? ” but luckily my mum was great and told me not to listen to her			0
' the turning point came in 2008 when , at the age of 25 , @entity5 was offered the part of @entity165 in @entity167 's @entity166			1
' that helped massively , ' she says			0
@entity5 sat down with the head of make - up and explained her condition , including the products and ingredients she used and avoided			1
' i 've used emollients and steroid creams all my life ; they do help , but i try to use the steroids sparingly because they have the side - effect of thinning your skin			2
my hands already look older than my years			0
' all eczema sufferers are advised to minimise the amount of product they put on their skin - besides their treatments			1
but @entity5 has to be especially careful because , like a third of people with eczema , she also has food allergies , including an allergy to nuts			1
food allergies are disproportionately high among eczema sufferers because the conditions share the mechanism of an exaggerated immune response , says dermatologist dr @entity61			1
' the new thinking is if eczema occurs before a baby is six months old they are likely to have a food allergy , whereas if it starts later the risk goes down			1
' @entity5 not only has to watch what she eats , she also has to check the labels of every product she puts on her skin			1
' only two years ago i was recommended a face cream , which was supposed to be good for eczema			2
i put it all over my face and my skin felt like it was on fire			1
that 's nuts : @entity5 , like a third of people with eczema , has a food allergy - to nuts ' i could n't breathe and my lips swelled up like sausages - my top lip was touching my nose and my bottom lip was touching my chin			1
my boyfriend googled the face cream straight away and found that it contained peanut oil			0
' @entity5 had gone into anaphylactic shock , a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction where the release of histamine can cause dangerous swelling in the airways			1
her boyfriend took her straight to @entity238 where she was treated with antihistamine and adrenaline			0
thankfully , with the experts at @entity166 , @entity5 has developed a regimen both to treat her eczema and , where needed , conceal it			1
she says : ' the problem is , so much of what 's out there for eczema is medical , but the fact is young people , and especially girls , want a cover - up , too			1
doctors tell you just to let the skin breathe , but when you 're 15 and going to school it 's not that simple			2
' @entity5 feels confident enough to talk publicly about her eczema for the first time			1
' lots of actors and models have it , but no one wants to talk about it because they feel they need to keep up this perfect ideal			0
' i want to get rid of the stigma because i remember what it was like to be a teenager with eczema			2
' people think it 's contagious and it 's gross			2
the more people understand what eczema is , the less of a big deal it is			1
' after years of trial and error , @entity5 has got living with eczema down to a fine art. here are her tips : @entity5 supports the @entity63			1

eczema occurs when the immune system *overreacts* to harmless allergens
this results in red , itchy patches of skin , often on knees and elbows
food allergies are disproportionately high among eczema sufferers
so people like @entity5 have to watch what they eat and put on their skin
