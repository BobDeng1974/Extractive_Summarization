in one corner , the mouthy puncher			2
in the other , the educated boxer			2
after three years of petty squabbling , cheap insults and idle threats , a line will finally be drawn under one of @entity9 boxing 's most bitter of rivalries			1
when first @entity13 and then @entity12 clamber through the ropes , both men will finally be free to do what they crave most : hurt each other			1
@entity13 and @entity12 continued their hostilities at the weigh - in on friday afternoon @entity13 finds one of @entity12 's taunts amusing as the pair had to be separated at the end of their weigh - in promoter @entity23 ( centre ) was on hand to keep the pair apart as the taunts and jibes continued opinion remains split down the middle as to which will conquer			1
repeat or revenge ? this is the classic clash of the hard - hitting puncher against the skilled boxer			1
while the waters will be muddied when the inevitable red mist descends , @entity12 's only chance of victory is surely the knockout			1
one he intends to be brutal			2
he says : ' i hope i do n't put him out with one shot			0
i want it to be painful			0
after he 's fought me he 's not going to want to box any more			1
' @entity12 , apparently rejuvenated at cruiserweight , has shown glimpses of why he was branded the ' bomber ' as an amateur with two stoppage victories this year			1
@entity13 and @entity12 will be contesting the @entity50 and @entity51 cruiserweight titles @entity12 weighed - in a fraction under the 200lb limit for the cruiserweight division ahead of facing @entity13 @entity13 received a hostile reception in @entity56 but remained focused at the weigh - in on friday although @entity13 has followed suit , his foes were of a lower calibre			1
indeed , as a world champion , he stopped just two of his six challengers			0
and in the first meeting in 2011 – a fight , incidentally that history has made much closer than the reality – it was @entity13 who out - boxed the more crude @entity12			1
and the @entity70 says : ' a lot of people have him as the favourite because he ’s the naturally bigger guy			0
' i feel comfortable , strong , sharp and fit			0
i ’ll beat this guy			2
i ’ll bring the speed , i ’ll bring the stamina			0
he can bring his power – i ’ve already tested it and i ’ve taken it with ease			0
has he become this @entity84 puncher overnight ? ' both men stand at a crossroads but each is made from different fibres			0
cleverly and @entity12 square up after the press conference ahead of their fight cleverly taunts rival @entity12 ahead of their anticipated re-match in @entity56 cleverly and @entity12 both look focused ahead of their fight in @entity56 this weekend @entity12 is a fighting man and knows little else ; he insists he would fight for free			1
@entity13 , who won three major titles while studying maths at university , is less limited			1
the question mark hanging over him is his mentality			0
does he have the heart for another war after being broken down piece by piece against @entity107 15 months ago ? @entity12 insists not			1
he says : ' he will say anything to convince himself at this moment in time			0
he 's probably telling himself he 's going to knock me out , he 's going to do this and that , but reality is striking home with him and it 's striking home very quickly			2
@entity12 soaked up the atmosphere before he hit the scales in front of the local @entity56 crowd the @entity56 crowd was orchestrated by @entity12 who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown he says : ' i 've got such a good academic brain and i could have a comfortable life outside boxing			1
i could turn my hand to many other things but its boxing i 've decided to do and to stick to because i 've worked too hard to just throw in the towel ; i 've come too far			2
' i 'm on the verge of big things again so to throw it away at this stage would be a real shame and something i could never forgive so for me its about giving it another crack and going to get another world title			0
that 's my goal and that 's what i 've set out to do			2
' these men pride themselves on being different but in reality share more than they care to admit			0
both have changed trainer following heavy defeats			0
both are almost two stone heavier than three years prior			0
but only one will achieve closure in front of a sold - out @entity156 crowd			2
the puncher or the boxer ? i predict the latter , a repeat performance from @entity162			0
and heartbreak for @entity12 .			1
