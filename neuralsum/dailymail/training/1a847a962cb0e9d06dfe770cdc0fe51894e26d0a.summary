forget being sneezed on : government scientists are deliberately giving dozens of volunteers the flu by squirting the live virus straight up their noses			1
it may sound bizarre , but the rare type of research is a step in the quest for better flu vaccines			2
it turns out that how the body fends off influenza remains something of a mystery			0
' vaccines are working , but we could do better , ' said dr. @entity18 of the @entity19 , who is leading the study that aims to infect up to 100 adults over the next year			1
it 's not an experiment to be taken lightly			0
after all , the flu kills thousands of @entity40 a year			1
for safety , @entity41 chose a dose that produces mild to moderate symptoms - and accepts only volunteers who are healthy and no older than 50			0
and to avoid spreading the germs , participants must spend at least nine days quarantined inside a special isolation ward at the @entity19 hospital , their health closely monitored			1
they 're not released until nasal tests prove they 're no longer contagious			0
the incentive : about $ 3,000 to compensate for their time			0
' i received a very scolding email from my mother ' about signing up , @entity55 , 26 , said with a grin			0
' their standards are so high , i do n't believe i 'm in danger , ' added @entity55 , a restaurant worker from @entity63 , @entity64 ' i do n't get sick that often			0
' a masked and gloved @entity41 had @entity55 lie flat for about a minute			0
infected : @entity55 volunteered to have the flu virus sprayed into his nasal passage as part of the study ' it will taste salty			1
some will drip down the back of your throat , ' @entity18 said , before squeezing a syringe filled with millions of microscopic virus particles , floating in salt water , into each nostril			1
sure enough , a few days later @entity55 had the runny nose and achiness of mild flu			1
the best defense against influenza is a yearly vaccine , but it 's far from perfect			2
in fact , the vaccine is least effective in people age 65 and older - the group most susceptible to flu - probably because the immune system weakens with age			1
understanding how younger adults ' bodies fight flu may help scientists determine what the more vulnerable elderly are missing , clues to help develop more protective vaccines for everyone , @entity18 explained			1
here 's the issue : the vaccine is designed to raise people 's levels of a particular flu - fighting antibody			1
it targets a protein that acts like the virus ' coat , called hemagglutinin - the ' h ' in @entity108 , the strain that caused the 2009 pandemic and that is causing the most illness so far this winter , too			2
isolation : test subjects like @entity55 are required to live in isolation at the hospital for nine days after they are infected but it 's not clear what antibody level is best to aim for - or whether a certain amount means you 're protected against getting sick at all , or that you 'd get a mild case instead of a severe one			1
' as mind - boggling as it is , we do n't know the answer to that , ' said dr. @entity125 , chief of @entity19 's @entity126			2
' we made some assumptions that we knew everything about flu			2
' just targeting hemagglutinin probably is n't enough , @entity18 added			1
already , some people in his study did n't get sick , despite remarkably low antibody levels , meaning something else must be protecting them			0
could it be antibodies against the ' n ' in flu 's name , the neuraminidase protein ? specific t cells that are activated to fight infection ? genes that switch on and off when a virus invades ? to begin finding out , @entity41 first developed a laboratory - grown copy of the h1n1 flu strain and sprayed different amounts into volunteers ' noses until he found the right dose to trigger mild flu			1
he hopes eventually to test the harsher @entity155 strain , too			1
now he 's infecting two groups - people with low antibody levels and those with high levels			0
some were recently vaccinated , and some were n't			0
he 'll compare how sick they get , how long they 're contagious and how the immune system jumps into action			0
flu : dr. @entity18 handles live doses of the flu virus intended for his test subjects called a human challenge study , this kind of research has n't been performed with flu viruses in the @entity40 for more than a decade , before scientists had ways as sophisticated to measure what happens			1
' it 's all going to add up to a better understanding of what you need to have to be protected against the flu , ' said dr. @entity182 , a flu specialist at the @entity184 who is closely watching the work			2
so far , @entity41 's patients are becoming contagious a day or two before they start feeling bad , one reason the flu spreads so easily			0
he sees a range of symptoms , from sniffles to a few days of moderate fever , fatigue and congestion			0
@entity55 's flu was pretty mild , and he passed the time studying , watching tv and playing games with the four other study participants infected this month			2
' all i had to do was read and watch movies , so it was n't that terrible , ' @entity55 said			0
' it was a really cool experience ' to see how research is done .			0

test subjects are required to stay in isolation at a hospital for nine days
researchers hope to develop a better flu vaccine by studying people with the virus in a controlled *environment*
dr. @entity18 hopes to infect about 100 people over the next year
