by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:20 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 03:47 est , 31 may 2012 a new ' stealth tax ' assault on @entity6 's 34million motorists is set to hit drivers of the greenest cars , the @entity2 can reveal			2
the move to ' reform ' @entity10 ( @entity10 ) will tighten the tax screw on drivers by increasing the amount of revenue all motorists have to pay – whether their cars are green or gas - guzzlers			1
the assault was signalled by chancellor @entity19 in the small print of the last budget though not mentioned in his @entity21 speech			1
' @entity23 ' : @entity19 , left , signalled the move in the small print of the last budget , and @entity26 minister @entity25 , right , outlined it to mps last week treasury minister @entity25 last week told mps debating rip - off fuel prices and calling for the ditching of controversial 3p duty rise in august that they were ' considering whether vehicle excise duty should be reformed to support the sustainability of public finances and to reflect the improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency			1
' the @entity37 said the changes sound ' sinister ' and warned drivers to brace themselves for more pain			1
the motoring group also believe the shake - up is tied to the prime minister 's controversial plans to privatise the main motorways and trunk roads in @entity47 – paying a proportion of the road tax collected to private companies who win the franchise to run them			1
the will also be allowed to raise tolls on any new roads or lanes they create			2
chancellor @entity19 did not mention the shake - up in his @entity21 speech			1
but the @entity2 can reveal that the plan is outlined in one brief paragraph on page 70 of the @entity63 ' red book ' setting out @entity65 intentions			1
it says : ' the government will consider whether to reform @entity10 over the medium term to ensure that all motorists continue to make a contribution to the sustainability of the public finances , and to reflect continuing improvements in vehicle efficiency			0
' taxes for vehicles were first introduced in the 1888 budget – before the first motor cars hit the road			1
flat rate vehicle excise duty was ring fenced for spending on road construction from 1920			0
but this ended in 1937 , after which it became a cash cow for funding other areas of government spending			0
the government started to levy varying taxes on cars depending on their co2 ratings in march 2005			2
ministers claimed it was to encourage people to buy cleaner cars			0
it was reformed along a sliding scale of 13 bands - from zero to more than £ 1,000 - and follows the principle that ' the polluter pays			0
' the more a car pollutes - based on emissions of carbon dioxide @entity104 per kilometre driven - the more the driver pays			0
the beauty of the system from a @entity63 perspective is that the cleaner cars become , the more it can tighten the screw			1
green car of the year : drivers of cars like the @entity114 face taxes on the vehicles being hiked as more environmentally friendly vehicles go on sale the @entity63 told the @entity2 it had ruled out a return to the original ' flat rate ' road tax for cars and said it would be consulting with motoring groups on reform			1
but the @entity37 says there are two key clues to the government 's intention			1
it highlights the @entity63 desire ' to ensure that all motorists continue to make a contribution to the sustainability of the public finances			1
' that suggests drivers of even the cleanest vehicles could lose their tax exempted status , and that the level of tax paid at each level will rise			2
the call ' to reflect continuing improvements in vehicle efficiency ' also suggests the tax screw will be ratcheted up to account of the fact that ever - cleaner cars mean that yesterday 's ' green ' car is tomorrow 's ' gas - guzzler			2
' vehicles are currently divided into 13 ' bands '			0
from april 1 drivers of the least polluting vehicles in ' @entity154 ' below 100g/km pay nothing			2
those in @entity157 between 101g and 110g/km pay £ 20			0
this rises steeply to top ' @entity159 ' where drivers of cars in excess of 255g/km will pay £ 475 – though in the first year of ownership this soars to £ 1,030 as a further disincentive			2
but @entity37 spokesman @entity166 pointed out that many mainstream diesel cars already have sub- 100g/km emissions – and therefore pay no tax			1
there are currently 57,000 vehicles in this zero bracket , nearly 500,000 in @entity157 and more than a million in @entity173 public highways ? the @entity37 believes the new tax hikes are linked to @entity177 's controversial plans to privatise the motorways and trunk roads mr @entity166 said : ' the @entity180 is going to tighten the tax screw			1
cars are getting cleaner so the @entity63 risks losing tax			1
tightening the @entity185 is one way to ratchet up the income			0
' they ca n't have too many cars which are clean and tax free			0
so they may scrap the tax - free status for the cleanest cars			0
' but he added : ' the timing is also key			0
the prime minister has raised the spectre of privatised motorways and trunk roads			1
he suggested they would receive a proportion of the road fund licence			0
to do that he might have to reform vehicle excise duty			0
' he added : ' rising fuel prices mean people are driving less so the government is getting less fuel tax			0
this may be a way to plug the gap			0
it 's a bit sinister			2
we 'll be disappointed if they ratche up the tax '			0
@entity216 's shadow transport minister @entity215 mp said : ' instead of tackling the soaring price of fuel , the chancellor has hidden plans for another stealth tax hike on motorists in the small print of the budget			1
' the conservative - led government must come clean about how much extra they plan to charge hard - pressed motorists by whacking up the rate of vehicle exercise duty			0
' a @entity63 spokesman said : ' we are asking questions			2

@entity63 will tighten the screw on drivers by increasing taxes on greener *models* to maintain revenue
@entity37 calls the plans sinister and believes they are tied to plans to privatise motorways and trunk roads
move was indicated in the last budget , but was hidden in the small print and not *announced* in @entity21 speech
