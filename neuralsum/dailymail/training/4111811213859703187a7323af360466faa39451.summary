rant : @entity1 wrote on a fan site that he was ' unable ' to watch the @entity3 former frontman of @entity5 has slammed @entity7 fans for their support of the country 's athletes in the @entity3 , asking : ' has @entity11 ever been so foul with patriotism ? ' the rock star , who has come out with controversial remarks in the past , has said that he can not even bring himself to watch the @entity3 , slating the presence of the @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity18 in the process			1
he even likened fans of the country 's growing support of their athletes to a mindset held by the populace @entity26 in the late 1930s , and told @entity27 to ' @entity28 '			1
the 53 - year - old singer will not have been celebrating , or even watching , on saturday when @entity30 brought home a remarkable eight gold medals - their best haul in a day since the 1908 @entity34			1
@entity1 , who fronted one of @entity7 's most influential bands , published a statement on the @entity38 to you fan site : ' i am unable to watch the @entity3 due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event			1
has @entity11 ever been quite so foul with patriotism ? ' the " dazzling royals " have , quite naturally , hi - jacked the @entity3 for their own empirical needs , and no oppositional voice is allowed in the free press			2
' it is lethal to witness			2
as @entity50 is suddenly promoted as a super-wealth brand , the @entity11 outside @entity50 shivers beneath cutbacks , tight circumstances and economic disasters			2
not celebrating ? @entity56 won gold on a remarkable saturday for the @entity58 , when they won three gold medals in athletics home support : @entity1 has condemned the ' blustering jingoism ' he believes the @entity34 has roused in the @entity58 public ' meanwhile the @entity58 media present 24 - hour coverage of the " dazzling royals " , laughing as they lavishly spend , as if such coverage is certain to make @entity58 society feel fully whole			1
in 2012 , the @entity58 public is evidently assumed to be undersized pigmies , scarcely able to formulate thought			1
' as i recently drove through @entity72 i noticed repeated graffiti seemingly everywhere on every available wall			2
in large blue letters it said @entity78			0
' it could almost have been written with the @entity58 public in mind , because although the spirit of 1939 @entity26 now pervades throughout media - brand @entity7 , the 2013 grotesque inevitability of @entity85 and @entity86 ( with sir @entity88 close at heel ) is , believe me , a fate worse than life			1
' the singer 's latest rant has not gone down at all well on @entity95 , where many users have taken to the site to hit back at @entity1			1
what a haul : @entity99 ( centre ) and @entity7 are on course to beat their previous record of 19 gold medals in the @entity34 disapproval : @entity1 ranted that the ' @entity106 ' had dominated the @entity3 comparison : @entity109 troops march past @entity110 in a @entity112 street in may 1939			1
@entity1 has likened the support for @entity58 athletes at the @entity3 to the mindset of the @entity112 people during the late 1930s @ @entity117 said on his profile : ' he is as dogmatic as those he opposes			1
unable to see anything but his own ideas as correct			0
# morrissey ' @ @entity122 quipped : ' he 'll not be at the closing ceremony then			0
' @ gwarizm tweeted their views on the rocker 's rant against the @entity34 : ' @entity1 complaining about nationalism ? a case of the pot calling the kettle " devious , truculent and unreliable			2
' and @ ameliadodge simply said : ' i feel like @entity1 lost his touch after he left @entity136 ' champion : the black athlete @entity138 , who won four gold medals at the @entity140 in @entity141 and embarrassed @entity110 , who had intended to use the @entity34 to promote his @entity143 ideals this is not the first time @entity1 has made remarks that have caused a stir			0
the singer , whose former band once released an album called @entity150 , criticised the @entity152 for their treatment of animals			0
@entity1 is a well - established vegetarian and animal rights campaigner			0
speaking to the @entity157 about @entity152 's treatment of circus animals , he said : ' did you see the thing on the news about their treatment of animals and animal welfare ? ' absolutely horrific			0
you ca n't help but feel that the @entity152 are a subspecies '			0
he has also made @entity170 comments in the past			0
last year , when the @entity172 visited @entity173 on a state visit , he even likened her royal highness @entity175 to the former @entity177 tyrant @entity176			0
he wrote in @entity173 magazine @entity178 last year : ' the very existence of the @entity172 and her now enormous family ... is entirely against any notion of democracy , and is against freedom of speech			0
for a broad historical view of what the @entity172 is and how she ' rules ' , examine @entity176 or @entity187 , and see if you can spot any difference			0
' the @entity191 wrote their 1986 album @entity193 , and sang the lyrics : ' her very @entity195 with a head in a sling / i 'm truly sorry â€“ but it sounds like a wonderful thing			2
' show of support : these fans wore @entity3 glasses to get behind @entity30 athletes @entity206 : @entity207 - a - plenty have been waved throughout a successful olympics for @entity209			1
