by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson so it was fixed right ? well probably not			0
while many have speculated over new @entity4 fixtures managing to put the first @entity5 of the season on the weekend that @entity7 comes back from his four - month ban			1
to ensure @entity7 played a full - part in that first @entity10 vs @entity12 game of the season the @entity4 would have needed to schedule it a bit later			1
if they fixed it they made a pretty bad job of it			0
@entity37 football will want @entity7 on the pitch for what is already being billed as the @entity40 ( @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 ) against @entity44 ( @entity7 , @entity45 and @entity46 )			1
but the @entity4 computer has not made that a certainty			2
it should be game - on however in the second half of the season			0
when the meeting in the @entity55 comes around in march we will see the two most expensive forward lines in history battle it out			0
the game at the @entity55 falls on the weekend of march 21 - 22			0
@entity5 fixed for @entity7 return date not fooling anyone : @entity7 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity65 cover up ! @entity7 holds his face to suggest that he had only collided with the @entity68 defender october 26 - @entity10 ( a ) january 11 - @entity69 ( @entity70 ) march 22 - @entity10 ( @entity70 ) may 17 - @entity69 ( a ) as always the @entity37 season repeats the first half of the campaign with games in exactly the same order			1
the first six weeks of the season are usually blocked - out by the @entity4 computer preventing a @entity10 vs @entity12 match happening too early in the season and therefore the return leg also happening too late			1
the last six weeks are also blocked preventing a @entity10 v @entity12 match coming too close to @entity83 semi-finals so that effectively leaves quite a small window of opportunity			1
@entity12 president @entity86 was sat next to @entity87 at @entity4 headquarters along with the other 18 club presidents on thursday lunchtime			2
he will now hope more than ever that when the court of arbitration for sport reviews the @entity7 case in the second week in august it will change the draconian ruling that prevents him so much as training			0
signed : @entity96 was unveiled as a @entity10 player on tuesday at the @entity98 he ’ll want the @entity100 winner as fit as possible to take on @entity101 and @entity102 in the old enemy ’s amphitheater			0
because there are @entity83 games the week previous to the weekend of october 25 - 26 the game will almost certainly be scheduled for the sunday so it could be some debut for @entity7 , albeit from the bench after his four months out of action			1
' it ’s all still a long way off , ' said @entity10 spokesman @entity112			0
it must seem that way for @entity12 ’s sidelined striker .			2

@entity7 may be able to make his @entity12 debut against @entity10
the two teams meet at the @entity120 on the weekend of october 25 - 26
the striker is currently serving a four - month ban for biting @entity65
@entity5 fixtures are not set too early or too late in the @entity4 season
@entity37 *authorities* do like @entity12 and @entity10 facing each other around the time of the @entity83 semi-finals
