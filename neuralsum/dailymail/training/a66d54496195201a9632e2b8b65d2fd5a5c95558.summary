’ allegations of the so - called ‘ @entity44 ’ plot to allow hardline @entity41 to take over a handful of schools were revealed last month in a leaked letter – supposedly written from one extremist to another			1
it detailed a five - step plan designed to take over the running of several @entity6 state schools , and listed examples of the non-muslim staff members who they had successfully ‘ forced out ’			1
claims : it is alleged the views of radical cleric @entity58 were promoted the authenticity of the document has since been called into question			1

yesterday @entity73 mp @entity72 criticised the probe for progressing at a ‘ glacial ’ speed			0
and @entity6 mp @entity76 claimed that the council has known about these allegations for ‘ eight years at least ’ but failed to act for fear of ‘ appearing @entity80 ’			2
the @entity73 politician said : ‘ young people are being targeted from a young age in schools across @entity6			1
it ’s much like what we got in the 1980s and 1990s where radicalism was being taught in universities where there were greater numbers of young people they could attract			0
‘ they are using schools in this way to persuade children to see their way of thinking , which will be useful to them later on			2

and another teacher , who has worked at several @entity6 schools , including @entity116 , told the @entity129 : ‘ they are promoting a radical form of @entity126			1
‘ children know no better so they just accept it , then they go home and their parents are n’t aware of it so these views go unchallenged			0
i ’m worried about what the future will hold for these children			0
