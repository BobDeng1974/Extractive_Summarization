he alleged he was contacted by @entity4 journalists who said they would pay him to retrieve the private phone records of the dead			1
the former cop , who now works as a private investigator , said that reporters wanted @entity20 victim ’s mobile numbers and details of calls in the days surrounding the tragedy			1
the voicemails are likely to have included harrowing messages from distraught relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones in the wake of the terrorist attacks in @entity8 in 2001			2
a source told the @entity31 : ' this investigator is used by a lot of journalists in @entity35 and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims ’ private phone data			1
' he said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their ­ relatives			1
' his presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the ­ relevant voicemails , just like it has been shown they have done in the @entity20			1
the @entity50 said he had to turn the job down			2
he knew how insensitive such research would be , and how bad it would look			2
' the source said that the ­ journalists were interested in getting the phone records belonging to the @entity20 victims of the attacks			1
under @entity35 law , the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) makes it a crime for @entity35 companies to offer corrupt payments to foreign government officials			2
if the allegations of payments to police officers are proven , mr @entity65 could face an @entity35 prosecution in his role as deputy chief operating officer the @entity35 - listed @entity72 a former @entity8 police officer has also claimed that @entity4 journalists tried to pay him for phone details of @entity20 9/11 victims capitalising on grief : reporters were allegedly tried to get hold frantic calls as the tragedy unfolded in 2009 , the former @entity82 producer @entity81 was jailed for six months after being prosecuted under the @entity58 for making $ 1.8m ( £ 1.1m ) in bribes to a @entity85 government official			1
@entity87 law professor @entity86 , an @entity58 expert , said : ' i would be very surprised if the @entity35 authorities do n't become involved in this @entity91 conduct			2
' he said the @entity58 could be invoked because @entity72 is an @entity35 company and because the alleged payments would have been made in order for the newspaper to make money from the stories obtained			0
@entity97 , media correspondent for the @entity99 news agency in @entity8 , said : ' if the fall out were to continue , my goodness , if it were to impact @entity65 , then we start to talk about it impacting @entity72 ’s succession plan , so that affects the company globally			1
' @entity107 , media correspondent for the @entity108 , added : ' there ’s a whole domino effect			0
what else falls apart ? do bankers get nervous ? ' @entity113 had one flirtation with bankruptcy in the early 90s			0
he ’s very dependent on the goodwill of @entity117 and of bankers			0
“ his company is very profitable now — it ’s not quite the same as the 1990s — but he does n’t want these dominoes to keep toppling … ' the fact he shut down a newspaper reflects how seriously the scandal is affecting a whole empire			0

' it looks like atonement , but it 's not			0
it 's supposed to change the subject , but it 's too late for that			0
' the most shocking thing to me about the paper 's closure is what an empty gesture it is			0
' i expected much better from the genocidal tyrant			0
' the tricky thing about the reverse ferret is that unless you nab the beast the moment it bursts out of a pant leg , it can be impossible to apprehend			0
' from the way @entity72 is acting , it looks to me as if the @entity164 have lost control of their precious ferret			0
if i were @entity113 , i 'd start wearing my socks over my cuffs			0
ferrets will eat anything that looks and smells like meat			0
' the claims came as the disgraced paper 's owner @entity113 flew into @entity175 to take personal charge of the phone - hacking scandal			2
he first stopped at @entity91 's headquarters in @entity179 , @entity175 , where he arrived in a red @entity180 , a copy of the last edition of the @entity4 in his hands			0

last hurrah : editor of the @entity4 , @entity216 , poses with staff outside the newspaper offices for the last time they had beaming smiles as they crossed the road to the @entity194 , where they were expected to dine together			0
they were later joined by mr @entity65 ’s son , @entity224 , the chairman of @entity91			2
pictures of the ' @entity113 and @entity186 show ' will infuriate the victims of phone hacking and those who question her denials			1
