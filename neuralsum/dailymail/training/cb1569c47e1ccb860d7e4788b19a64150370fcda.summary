by @entity1 reporter published : 09:46 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 03:25 est , 7 march 2014 space odyssey gravity was the big winner at last night 's @entity5			1
the movie about a medical engineer and an astronaut stranded in space after an accident , starring @entity11 and @entity12 , bagged seven awards during one of the most hotly contended events in years			1
but while the awards are normally the domain of the major @entity21 film studios , two small @entity17 visual effects teams emerged as the stars of the event			1
triumph : ( from left to right ) visual effects artists @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 celebrate winning @entity30 in @entity32 award for ' gravity ' at the @entity5 @entity34 brought the stunning visuals in the lost - in - space fantasy drama to life - creating everything you see on screen except the actors ' faces , while the jaw - dropping 3d effects were the product of conversion company @entity44			1
collecting one of the golden statuettes , the film 's visual effects supervisor @entity26 praised the crew behind the camera for their extraordinary work producing one of the most talked - about films of the year			1
but it is testament to the skill of the visual effects experts who helped create the amazing film - produced almost entirely inside a cramped studio - that much of their work was invisible to the audience			1
stunning : gravity , starring @entity12 as @entity64 , won seven awards at the @entity5 complicated : the team behind the visual effects had to created a convincing sense of zero gravity using @entity69 describing one of the most difficult scenes to capture , mr @entity26 - who has worked on films including @entity73 and avatar - detailed how painstaking attention had to be paid to every frame in order to maintain the sense of reality			1
gravity was the toast of @entity21 after winning seven @entity5			1
@entity82 director @entity81 was lauded for his vision which helped create a stunning movie			2
but @entity5 judges heaped praise upon the team behind the film 's revolutionary special effects			1
the film won : ' there ’s the shot where the @entity94 is being destroyed , which is incredibly complicated to choreograph and to simulate the destruction , and @entity12 ’s action is very complicated in that , so that was very difficult , ' he told @entity98			2
the team pioneered @entity69 which involved imposing actors in a studio on to entire landscapes and backgrounds			2
what set gravity apart from other films which used computers were the hyper realistic backgrounds			2
whereas the 2009 sci - fi 3d epic @entity110 was set in a fantasy landscape , @entity79 had the difficulty of making the interior of the international space station as convincing as possible			1
one of the techniques adopted was called previsual in which every camera angle and movement of the actor was planned in advance			0
the painstaking process enabled the team to seamlessly impose the actors into an environment where objects , cameras and background appear to be moving			2
@entity26 told @entity98 : ' we did replace bits of it with @entity69 , because she was being held up by rigs , and rigs would cover bits of her , but on the whole it ’s her body			0
and so that made that incredibly complicated to shoot to make it look as though she was floating			0
' the use of @entity144 effects was also was also a hallmark of the movie			2
a team from @entity44 spent six - months converting the film footage into stunning and convincing stereo or @entity144 images			1
' many of our early discussions about the stereo concerned the contrast in style between the environments inside and outside the capsule , ' said @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity44			2
award - winners : @entity161 ( r ) , winner for @entity162 with @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 ( @entity166 ) winners for @entity168 , all for the film ' gravity ' painstaking : the finished film was the culmination of months of painstaking work by visual effects teams meticulous : the actors faces were imposed onto a computer generated background ' part of the vision for the stereo was to create a contrast between the vast , unending feeling of space for the exterior shots and the claustrophobia , isolation and loneliness of the interior shots in the close confines of the capsule – something that i feel really comes across when you see the film			1
' ' everyone with an interest in filmmaking is familiar with the long seamless shots that @entity81 and cinematographer @entity202 created for @entity203 , ' said @entity204			0
' on gravity , @entity81 and @entity202 have gone one step further			0
the long , unbroken , floating camera shots work spectacularly well in space , and led to us producing the longest continuous shot that i believe has ever been converted – 15,531 frames , or 10mins 47 secs			0
high - tech : creating the stunning movie gravity was only made possible with thanks to cutting edge computer technology gravity is about a medical engineer and an astronaut stranded in space after an accident ' but for us , this film was so much more than just the technical achievements , or solving the production challenges - gravity is one of those movies that we ’ll all look back on later in our careers and be extremely proud to have worked on			1
' ' there was a time , perhaps , when conversion was seen by some as an afterthought , tacked onto the end of the filmmaking process to sell more tickets , ' added @entity158			0
' gravity is here to bury that thought once and for all			0
gravity is unlike anything you have seen before			0
in terms of @entity144 , this film is awe - inspiring			0
' in terms of filmmaking , it ’s a quantum leap forward , creatively and technically			0
in terms of unifying the practical toolsets used to realize the storytelling vision , it ’s unmatched			0
it was an absolute honor to be part of the team entrusted with delivering @entity81 ’s extraordinary vision for @entity79			0
' gravity is available to own now on @entity259 , dvd and in @entity144 .			0

@entity261 - based @entity44 created stunning 3d effects
@entity34 created everything you see on screen except the actors ' face
