mr @entity76 , sitting at @entity47 , said it was described by the police as one of the best cannabis factories ever found in @entity81 in recent history			0

deep underground : the disused railway tunnels housed a warren of tunnels devoted to growing vast quantities of the @entity94 drug elaborate : a trapdoor in the floor of the railway tunnel led to where the cannabis production was taking place ' there should be others standing alongside you in the dock today , ' he said			1

' the officer in the case described the set up as one of the best he had encountered in 22 years of service as a drugs officer , ' said mr @entity115			0
' the simple fact is that this is one of the best - designed and constructed commercial operations that @entity233 have ever encountered			0
' @entity50 told police he had been approached to look after the place , had invested his £ 40,000 savings into the venture , he was retired and said he felt pressurised into taking part in the venture			1
@entity56 said he was a self - employed commercial building designer , but was bankrupt			0
