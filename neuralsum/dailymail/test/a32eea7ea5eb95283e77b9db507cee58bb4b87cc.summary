@entity2 's family 's charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments			1
the charities ' errors generally took the form of under - reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments , or in other instances , omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue , the charities confirmed to @entity16 , which uncovered the mistakes			1
following the discovery , the @entity18 and the @entity19 said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors			1
the foundation and its donors have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks			0
@entity30 critics say the foundation makes @entity32 , who is seeking the 2016 @entity35 presidential nomination , vulnerable to undue influence			2
her campaign team calls these claims ' absurd conspiracy theories '			0
following @entity16 ' report @entity30 presidential candidate @entity41 called on the non-profit to return all of the money it received from foreign governments			1
a charity must show copies of the forms to anyone who wants to see them to understand how the charity raises and spends money			2
the unsettled numbers on the tax returns are not evidence of wrongdoing but tend to undermine the 990s role as a form of public accountability , experts in charity law and transparency advocates told @entity16			1
' if those numbers keep changing - well , actually , we spent this on this , not that on that - it really defeats the purpose , ' said @entity84 , a senior fellow at the @entity85 , a government transparency advocacy group			0
for three years in a row beginning in 2010 , the @entity18 reported to the @entity58 that it received zero in funds from foreign and @entity90 governments , a dramatic fall - off from the tens of millions of dollars in foreign government contributions reported in preceding years			1
those entries were errors , according to the foundation : several foreign governments continued to give tens of millions of dollars toward the foundation 's work on climate change and economic development through this three - year period			1
those governments were identified on the foundation 's annually updated donor list , along with broad indications of how much each had cumulatively given since they began donating			0
' we are prioritizing an external review to ensure the accuracy of the 990s from 2010 , 2011 and 2012 and expect to refile when the review is completed , ' @entity106 , a foundation spokesman , said in an email			2
the @entity18 erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years - even though it previously received millions			1
pictured , @entity84 and @entity2 speak about the charity last september the decision to review the returns was made last month following inquiries from @entity16 , and the foundation has not ruled out extending the review to tax returns extending back 15 or so years			1
@entity106 declined to comment on why the foundation had not included the necessary break - down of government funding in its 990 forms			0
he said it was rare to find an organization as transparent as the foundation			0
' no charity is required to disclose their donors , ' he said			0
' however , we voluntarily disclose our more than 300,000 donors and post our audited financial statements on our website along with the 990s for anyone to see			0
' separately , the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , the foundation 's flagship program , is refiling its form 990s for at least two years , 2012 and 2013 , @entity19 spokeswoman @entity138 said , describing the incorrect government grant break - outs for those two years as typographical errors			2
@entity19 , which is best known for providing cheaper drugs for tens of thousands of people with @entity146 around the world , began filing separate tax returns in 2010 , and has previously refiled at least once both its 2010 and 2011 form 990s			1
changes : in light of @entity2 seeking the 2016 @entity35 presidential nomination , the foundation said it would only continue to receive donations from six countries that are already supporting ongoing projects ' i ’m # readyforhillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations , ' @entity30 presidential candidate @entity41 said on @entity161			1
' add your name if you are too , ' he added , including a link to a @entity41 for president petition asking for supporters ' email addresses and zip codes for both those years , @entity19 said its initial filings had over-reported government grants by more than $ 100 million			2
some experts in charity law and taxes said it was not remarkable for a charity to refile an erroneous return once in a while , but for a large , global charity to refile three or four years in a row was highly unusual			1
' i 've never seen amendment activity like that , ' said @entity185 , a @entity186 lawyer who has specialized in charity law for more than four decades , referring to the @entity19 filings			0
@entity32 stepped down from the foundation 's board of directors this month but her husband , @entity32 , and their daughter , @entity193 , remain directors			0
the foundation said last week after @entity2 became a candidate that it would continue to accept funding from foreign governments , but only from six countries that are already supporting ongoing projects			2
@entity19 will also continue to receive foreign government funding , again with additional restrictions			0
@entity204 , @entity32 's spokesman , has declined to answer inquiries about the foundation and @entity19			0
though mrs. @entity2 has abdicated her board seat , @entity30 rival @entity41 has zeroed in on the @entity35 presidential candidate in a tweets about the @entity18 's tax headaches			1
' i ’m # readyforhillary to return all the money she raised from foreign nations , ' he said , referencing a @entity216 organization that spent more than a year laying the groundwork for her eventual announcement			0
' add your name if you are too , ' he added , including a link to a @entity41 for president petition asking for supporters ' email addresses and zip codes .			0

a @entity16 investigation uncovered errors in tax returns filed by the @entity18 and the @entity19
for 3 years , the @entity18 reported it had received nothing from foreign and @entity90 governments - despite receiving millions previously
it will now refile its tax returns from 2010 , 2011 and 2012 but has not ruled out reviewing tax returns extending back as many as 15 years
the @entity19 is refiling forms from at least 2 years
experts said it was not uncommon for charities to have to **re-file** but said it was unusual that a global charity would have to **re-file** for multiple years
@entity30 presidential candidate @entity41 called on the non-profit to return all of the money it received from foreign governments
