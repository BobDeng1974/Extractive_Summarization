the bird , a steppe eagle called @entity13 , landed on the cabinet and then knocked over a selection of ornaments with its 4ft wings and pecked at a bowl of pot - pourri			1
@entity26 ’s friend @entity41 put on a winter jacket and gloves for protection and tried to lure the big bird down			1
when that failed , the pair placed pieces of ham outside in a bid to tempt it but with no joy			1
they then phoned a local bird of prey rescue centre and an expert spent 30 minutes coaxing the eagle eagle onto his glove using a dead chick			1
he then took the young eagle back to the rescue centre where he gave it some food			2
it was later reunited with its owner and falconer @entity63 who revealed the young bird was called storm and was being trained to ward off seagulls at a nearby landfill site			1
the eagle had been reported missing three days prior to turning up at @entity26 ’s house after it was frightened by a loud bang and broke its tethers			0
@entity72 : the eagle looks like an ornament as it perches on @entity26 's wooden display cabinet flight and fright : @entity26 's friend @entity41 put on a winter jacket and gloves for protection and tried to lure the bird down and then put ham outside to tempt it outside , but with no joy @entity26 , a retired maths teacher aged in her 50s , said : ' we were about to watch the final of the @entity35 tennis when this big black thing swooped into the room			1
' we have had small birds fly into the patio doors before and i thought it might have happened again but then @entity41 said " it ’s an eagle "			1
' we could n’t believe it			0
initially there was total panic - our two dogs were in the front room and they both jumped to their feet and started barking			2
' we took them into a bedroom and shut the door then went back into the lounge to get a proper look			2
' there was the huge eagle , around 18 inches tall , sat on top of the wooden glass cabinet			1
' it had knocked over a few ornaments and then started pecking away at a bowl of potpourri			0
' we thought about trying to tempt it back outside and tried putting ham outside but it did n’t work so we called the police who put us in touch with @entity23			1
' they came out quickly and thankfully they were able to get the eagle down from the top of the cabinet without it damaging anything or getting hurt			2
' coaxing it down : the bird was reunited with its owner and falconer @entity63 who revealed the young bird was called storm and was being trained to ward off seagulls at a nearby landfill site the @entity135 @entity134 in @entity136 - originate from @entity135 , @entity137 and @entity138 and winter in @entity139 and @entity140			1
they can grow to 2.5ft tall with a wingspan of up to 7ft			2
they favour open dry habitats , such as the desert or steppes ( grassland plains )			0
they feed mostly on carrion , but will also hunt rodents and small mammals as well as small birds			0
@entity154 eagles often prefer to scavenge and are known to steal food from other raptors			0
like some other birds , they have a crop ( thin - walled , expanding area ) in their throats which enables them to store food for several hours before digesting them			0
@entity167 , who runs @entity23 with her husband @entity168 , said : ' we got a call from a lady yesterday afternoon saying there was a bird of prey sat in her front room			2
' we thought it might be a small bird like a sparrowhawk but when we got to her house there was this huge @entity135 @entity180 sat on a cabinet			1
' @entity168 tempted the eagle down onto his glove with a dead chick and we took it back to the rescue centre where we gave it some food			1
' its owner came to pick it up and was very relieved to have it back again			2
' he is training it to scare off seagulls at a landfill site where he works and it had broken its tethers after being frightened by a loud bang at the site			1
' mr @entity63 said the eagle was recovering at his home after the ordeal			0
he said : ' he broke his tethers and flew off			0
i knew it was only a matter of time until he turned up somewhere but the question was where that would be			0
' i 'm very pleased to have him back safe and well			0
he is weathering out and relaxing at home now			0
' i have spoken to @entity26 and apologised for ruining her tennis match ! ' mr @entity63 is a professional falconer who flies birds of prey at industrial sites to scare off seagulls			1

he was rescued from his previous owners who had not cared for him very well			0
' he was in a real state when he came to me but now he 's 100 per cent better			0
' i have eight falcons which i fly at sites to keep seagulls away and i decided to take storm to work with me			2
