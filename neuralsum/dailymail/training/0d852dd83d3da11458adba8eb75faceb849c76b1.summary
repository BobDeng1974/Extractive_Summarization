@entity0 put in a stunning display as the @entity2 began their @entity4 campaign with a hard - fought draw against a resilient @entity6			1
the @entity8 winger , who has been in superb form in the @entity10 this season , was the creative force in a team set - up to attack , and was rewarded with a second - half goal , which cancelled out given @entity17 ’s early strike			2
on the first match - day outside of the country ’s two major cities , and without the hosts playing any part , there was some concern that @entity26 ’s stadium might be empty for the @entity28 clashes			0
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity29 tips the ball around the post in the match against @entity2 @entity0 ( right ) competes alongside @entity33 of @entity6 in the 1 - 1 draw @entity6 's @entity35 ( left ) tussles with @entity36 ( right ) as they chase the ball @entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity29 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity35 ; @entity33 ( @entity42 86 ) , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) ; @entity48 goal : @entity43 2 booked : @entity40 30 @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 4 ) : @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 © ; @entity36 ( @entity57 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 64 ) , @entity60 , @entity0			1
goal : @entity0 66 those doubts proved to be unfounded , however , as locals and travelling supporters alike packed out the small ground in the jungle city , overfilling the stands to such an extent that some fans were moved into the press box to find them seats			0
it took @entity6 , the @entity4 winners in 2012 , just 62 seconds to take the lead , when @entity76 in the @entity2 goal made a hash of punching away a cross from the left hand side , and @entity43 curled in from the edge of the box			1
the men in green were always likely to sit back and play to their strengths on the counter-attack , where @entity87 ’s @entity48 was a constant threat , and the early goal allowed them to adopt their favoured gameplan and frustrate the @entity2 side			0
@entity0 was the biggest threat in a @entity2 side that lined up with an all - out front four , but he was hindered by a @entity95 defence that conceded just twice during qualification , and a pitch that cut up at an alarming rate			1
there were concerns before the game that the stadium would not be full for @entity6 v @entity2 fans were in jubilant spirits ahead of the first game of @entity28 at the @entity4 the @entity8 winger was still able to create an early chance for striker @entity58 , but the centre forward could n’t get the ball out of his feet			1
the @entity112 kept attacking throughout the first half , and were almost handed a goal by @entity6 keeper @entity29 , who spilled a cross straight to @entity60 , only for the striker to blaze over from 6 yards			2
@entity29 more than made up for his early error though , saving well from both a @entity0 drive and an @entity60 header			0
the one time the @entity6 keeper was beaten in the first period , by a deflected @entity0 free kick , the ball squirmed inches wide of the post			2
as the game wore on the men in white seemed to be running out of ideas , the @entity6 defence living up to their mean - spiritied reputation			0
@entity6 's @entity131 ( left ) challenges @entity2 's @entity60 ( right ) for possession @entity6 's @entity33 ( left ) vies with @entity56 ( right ) of @entity2 but , when a slip by @entity6 left back @entity135 gifted possession to @entity136 , the @entity95 were exposed			1
he picked out @entity0 on the edge of the box , and the winger curled it beautifully into the top corner			0
suddenly the chances started to flow , substitute @entity143 threatening with a couple of strikes from the edge of the box , before a spectacular @entity60 bicycle kick was saved by @entity29			0
but neither side could fashion a winner , and were forced to share the points ahead of games against @entity152 and @entity153 .			2

@entity43 put @entity6 ahead with low strike after only 62 seconds
but @entity8 's @entity0 equalised with a strike from *18* yards
@entity0 propelled @entity2 's attacks but was unable to fashion a winner
