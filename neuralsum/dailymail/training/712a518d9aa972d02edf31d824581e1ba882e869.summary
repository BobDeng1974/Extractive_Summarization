by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 09:41 est , 20 june 2012 two young children of a lesbian couple will receive thousands of pounds in @entity4 compensation after the death of their sperm donor father who was also the nephew one of the women			1
@entity9 , four , and his sister @entity10 , six , were secretly fathered by 20 - year - old @entity11 , who died after hospital doctors failed to spot a lethal blood clot			1
mr @entity11 ’s aunt , also called @entity15 , 42 , is the civil partner of @entity16 , 31 , who became the biological mother of the children after his donated sperm helped her fall pregnant			1
family : @entity15 , right , whose now deceased nephew donated sperm so that her civil partner @entity16 , left , could give birth to children @entity26 , six , and @entity10 , four the adult trio kept the truth a closely - guarded secret between themselves until mr @entity11 ’s death forced his aunt to make an emotional confession about the true identities of the children to her sister @entity36 , the victim ’s mother			1
mrs @entity36 and her husband , @entity39 , believe six doctors at @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , made errors in his care by dismissing his symptoms and ignoring vital test results			2
the couple , from nearby @entity49 , immediately launched legal action against @entity51			2
the trust has now admitted liability over his death and agreed to pay out £ 85,000 in compensation following a settlement in the medical negligence case			1
@entity26 and @entity10 have each had £ 35,000 put into a trust fund and will receive the money once they turn 18			1
mrs @entity36 will also get an additional £ 6,255 due to ongoing health problems , including depression			2
the remainder will go into her son ’s estate			2
father : sperm donor @entity11 tragically died at the age of 20 after doctors failed to detect a blood clot today , @entity70 said : ‘ my kids are n’t going to see their dad ever again and nothing has happened to the doctors			1
‘ it ’s absolutely disgusting			2
it ’s not about the money at all			2
my kids look up to the sky every day and talk to their dad			0
‘ he should be here with them			0
he played a big part in their lives			0
‘ we would all go out for sunday lunch together			0
we would take them to the park together			0
‘ they are the spitting double of him too			0
we are over the moon for what he did for us			0
he gave me and @entity16 a family and i ’ll never forget him for that			0
i would give up everything to have him back			0
’ mr @entity11 became seriously ill ten days after undergoing a routine hernia operation at @entity99 in november 2009			1
he was rushed into @entity41 suffering from severe chest and back pain and was vomiting blood on december 8 , with a letter from his gp stating his symptoms were indicative of a post-operative clot			1
but doctors at the @entity42 - based hospital ruled out the fatal condition despite abnormal test results , which included an x-ray showing a shadow on his right lung			1
instead , they diagnosed him with a suspected viral chest infection and discharged him the next day			0
mr @entity11 later collapsed at his home in @entity49 and died on december 9 , when the clot , which had formed in his left leg , travelled through his veins and into his heart , causing a cardiac arrest			1
@entity11 also left a sister @entity123 , 16 , and brother @entity124 , 21			1
it was only then that the family learned that he had been the father to little @entity26 and @entity10			1
his parents , who learned they were biological grandparents as well as aunt and uncle to @entity26 and @entity10 , were shocked but overjoyed to make the discovery the youngsters had been conceived with their son ’s help			1
mrs @entity36 said : ‘ even though it was n’t done in the most conventional of ways , he still would have been in their lives and at some point , [ the children ] would have been told about him			2
it was never going to be a secret kept forever			0
’ speaking about the settlement , she saide : ‘ for us , it ’s never been about the money			0
no amount of money in the world can mend a broken heart			0
close : @entity11 with his aunt @entity15 , who kept his sperm donation secret until after his death ‘ until we get an apology and something is done about what they did , we will not walk away from this			1
’ his parents had hoped that the @entity4 trust would specifically acknowledge the children			1
mrs @entity36 added : ‘ we did n’t want to accept their offer because , at first , they refused to acknowledge the kids			0
‘ we even offered to provide dna samples if they had wanted			0
‘ we told them we would accept an offer , if they recognised them , which they have now done			0
‘ but i feel like it ’s an insult to my son ’s memory because , more than two years on , we have still not had an apology for what happened , which would have gone a long way if they had have done that at the beginning			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity51 said : ‘ we are deeply saddened by the death of mr @entity11 and wish to again express our sympathies to his family at this difficult time			1
‘ whilst a settlement has been made , we recognise it will not compensate the family for their loss			0
‘ we have implemented the recommendations made by the coroner and have put the necessary measures in place to minimise the chance of a similar case happening again			2
