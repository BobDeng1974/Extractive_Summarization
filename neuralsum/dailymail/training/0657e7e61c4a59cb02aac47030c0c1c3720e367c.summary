the underground shelter was built during the height of the @entity5 in 1958 to protect key personnel in the event of nuclear war			1
it is accessed through a small reinforced concrete hatch and ladder which leads 20ft down to a shower , small kitchen , chemical toilet and beds			1
welcoming : the bunker , with its own air supply , was originally used during nuclear exercises by the @entity21 the underground shelter was built in 1958 by the @entity23 to protect key personnel in the event of nuclear war the bunker , with its own air supply , was originally used during nuclear exercises by the @entity21			1
but for nearly half a century it has become damp and neglected beneath the fields of a farm in @entity29 , @entity30			1
landowner @entity31 , 58 , who was a young boy when it was built by the @entity33 , has now sold it to an undisclosed buyer			2
he said : ' i would n't want to live there - even if it meant surviving the @entity39			2
you 'd just be stuck in the ground			2
in need of an update : the interior of the bunker in @entity29 , @entity30 the shelter was snapped up for a meagre £ 15,000 when farmer @entity31 decided he did n't need a nuclear bunker any more there are believed to be fewer than 1,000 @entity5 nuclear bunkers left in @entity50 the @entity5 is the name given to the relationship that developed primarily between the @entity52 and the @entity53 after @entity54			1
the @entity5 was to dominate international affairs for decades and many major crises occurred - the @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and the @entity60 being just some			1
for many , the growth in weapons of mass destruction was the most worrying issue			2
as a result underground military bases where @entity67 and the @entity68 prepared for what might have been were built during the period			2
about 1,500 of bunkers like the one in @entity29 , @entity30 , at were built during the height of the @entity5 in the 1950s , with many decommissioned less than 10 years later			1
the three sites up for sale were used until 1992 , when they were taken out of service following the collapse of the @entity53			0
many have been bought by telecommunication companies and others are used as safe storage for computer systems , but also memorabilia collectors have been tempted to snap up the bunkers			0
' it has been on the farm my whole life			0
when i was younger it was in use and soldiers would be posted there , but gradually they stopped coming back			0
' he added : ' i have been selling bits of land over the last few years , and finally decided to get rid of the shelter			2
' i was going to do something with it , but then i decided that if i wanted to live underground , i would live somewhere bigger			0
' it 's a total mess down there , and it 's filled with stuff left over from when it was being used			0
' the new owner of the bunker has told @entity31 he plans to renovate it so it can be used in the event of a catastrophe			0
@entity108 , who runs a unique property website , said the bunker sale was an opportunity to buy a unique piece of construction for not very much money			0
he said : ' they are really interesting and at a price you can afford , i 'm not surprised this bunker was snapped up so quickly			0
' it 's a time capsule from a period of history that we will hopefully never have to revisit			0
' they were seen as a beacon of hope in a terrifying time , but now i think an anti-nuclear bunker would be the perfect place to hide from your angry wife			0
' there are believed to be fewer than 1000 @entity5 nuclear bunkers left in @entity50			1
mr @entity31 has lived on the farm in @entity29 , @entity30 , his entire life , and was only three when the @entity33 began construction on the subterranean structure damp and neglected : this shaft leads to the underground bunker mr @entity31 said : ' it 's a total mess down there , and it 's filled with stuff left over from when it was being used '			1
