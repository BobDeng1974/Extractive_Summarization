by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 06:59 est , 23 august 2012 burying her face in the baby ’s blanket , @entity1 has her first and last cuddle with her beloved daughter			1
the harrowing photograph captures the precious moments @entity10 spent with @entity11 after the infant was stillborn			1
just days before it was taken , midwives had told @entity10 that all was well with her baby			1
but it later emerged that they had missed vital signs that the foetus was critically under - developed			1
by the time they did notice , it was too late to save her , and @entity11 died in her mother ’s womb two days before her due date			1
heartbreaking : the harrowing moment @entity1 cradles her stillborn daughter @entity11 who died in the womb two days before she was due to be born her parents released the heart - wrenching photograph yesterday as they told of their anger at how medical staff ‘ played @entity34 ’ with their child ’s life			1
‘ @entity11 knew more love in her short stay with us than some children know in their lifetime , ’ said miss @entity10			0
‘ we just gazed at her all evening and wondered how we could have made something so beautiful and perfect			0
’ following the baby ’s death , the hospital admitted mistakes had been made			2
despite the fact that the unborn child was under - developed , medical staff at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , repeatedly assured the expectant parents that there was ‘ nothing to worry about ’			1
miss @entity10 , 39 , said : ‘ they measured her as small and told me not to worry about it , played @entity34 with my baby ’s life and our little girl paid the ultimate price – her life			1
their lack of care took our wonderful baby away from us for ever			2
‘ they may have taken away our one and only chance of having a baby			2
’ never forgotten : @entity1 and her partner @entity73 with a box of keepsakes to remind them of their stillborn daughter a parent 's worst nightmare : the tiny coffin containing the body of baby @entity11 , who died two days before her delivery date if miss @entity10 had been induced or the baby delivered by caesarean and given specialist care , she may be alive today			1
instead , the child was so weak that she died in her mother ’s womb two days before her due date and miss @entity10 was forced to go through the trauma of a stillbirth			1
following the ordeal , she was given a few heartbreaking hours to say goodbye to her daughter , and partner @entity73 , 40 , took this photograph			1
the couple , from @entity98 , had been trying for a baby for three years and suffered a miscarriage early in 2010			1
when miss @entity10 conceived again in september of that year , they were cautious , but doctors told them they were having a ‘ textbook ’ pregnancy and their confidence grew			2
following scans at 36 weeks and 38 weeks , three separate midwives told the couple that their baby was small , but said they did not need to worry about it			1
' they may have taken away our one and only chance of having a baby			2
' they later discovered that by the 40th week , @entity11 was five weeks behind on her development			0
it was only during the final check - up that a midwife raised concerns about the size of the baby and immediately referred miss @entity10 for a scan			1
the following day , miss @entity10 felt some unusual movement and had a wave of nausea			0
she now believes this was the exact moment @entity11 died			2
she said : ‘ i remember feeling some very small movements in bed in the morning , which was unusual			0
at lunch time , for about 30 seconds i felt quite sick and had stomach ache			0
‘ i just put this down to being due any minute			2
i now know this was her way of telling me the exact time she had gone			0
’ in the wrong : earlier this year @entity139 - which ran @entity50 ( pictured ) at the time - admitted a breach of duty empty : @entity1 stands over the cot of her daughter @entity11 at her home in @entity98 , @entity52 grief : the couple are to receive compensation after the hospital accepted responsibility miss @entity10 did n’t feel any further movements all day so she went to the hospital for a check - up			1
she was referred to another hospital for a heartbeat scan , which confirmed her worst fears			0
miss @entity10 said : ‘ i did n’t look at the screen			0
our lives changed for ever from that second onwards			0
‘ i did n’t know what to feel or think and just lay on the bed with a blank mind			0
it was n’t until i got my pyjamas and went into the bathroom to change that it hit me			0
‘ i could see my large bump in the mirror and knew we would n’t be taking our baby home			2
i then started crying and screaming and @entity73 came in to comfort me			0
’ miss @entity10 was induced the next day – the day before her predicted due date – and @entity11 , weighing 5lbs 7oz , was delivered			1
after she was discharged from the hospital , miss @entity10 returned to spend some time with @entity11			0
she said : ‘ @entity73 and i hoped for a girl all along and we got our wish			2
she was absolutely beautiful and completely normal in every way			0
‘ i had to force myself with all my strength to put her back in her little white coffin			0
’ in march this year , @entity139 – which ran @entity50 at the time – admitted a breach of duty and that the midwives had been in the wrong			0
it has also agreed to pay the couple an undisclosed amount of compensation			1
school finance officer @entity10 said : ‘ to hear it officially and then to read that if action had been taken our baby would be here was heartbreaking			1
’ in a statement , @entity191 , which now runs the maternity services at the hospital , said it took full responsibility and was addressing the problems raised			2
miss @entity10 – who suffered another miscarriage in may this year – has reported the errors to the @entity200			0
she is also campaigning for growth charts to be given a prominent position in maternity books to help prevent similar tragedies .			0
