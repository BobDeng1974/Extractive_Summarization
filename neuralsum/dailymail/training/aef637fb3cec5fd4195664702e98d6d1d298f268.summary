but one woman has been plagued for three years by a a rare illness which means she hears novelty 50s hit ' @entity15 ? ' @entity1 suffers from a form of tinnitus where music and songs play constantly in her head on a loop - meaning she has had to endure three years of sleepless nights			1
other tunes which have intermittently tormented the 63 - year - old school cleaner during that time also include @entity26 , happy birthday and @entity28			2
mrs @entity1 explained : ' it 's like having a radio that you just ca n't turn off			1
' i began hearing tunes in my ears three years ago and it just has not stopped since			0
' it 's especially bad at night time and i have terrible trouble getting to sleep - it drives me to breaking point at times			2
' it comes and goes but i can always hear music , especially @entity15 , faintly in the background			0
' the rare condition , known as musical hallucination , has left doctors baffled with hospital consultants saying there is nothing more they can do to treat her bizarre problem			1
@entity1 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , continued : ' they have given me a hearing aid which they had hoped would fix my hearing problems and therefore stop the music but it just has n't worked			1
' i had special therapy too but they 've now told me there is nothing more they can do			0
' i 've come to accept that i 'm probably going to be stuck with this hellish condition for the rest of my life			0
' @entity1 used to love ' how much is that doggy in the window ' , a version made famous by @entity70 ( right ) @entity1 has worked as a cleaner at the @entity71 for the past 27 years and has learnt to live with the condition by using calming noises , such as bird song and whale music , to block out the phantom tunes			1
but the annoying music is often so loud it drowns out the sound of her retired lorry driver husband @entity79 when he is speaking			0
she added : ' there are times when my husband will be trying to talk to me and i ca n't hear what he is saying over the music			1
' it can be very frustrating and it drives us both mad at times			0
' @entity1 has had problems with her hearing since a very young age around the same time that she first heard the tune that most commonly features in her musical hallucinations			1
she said : ' my mum told me that when i was young i used to love the song how much is that @entity15			2
' i used to sing it around the house all the time but now i ca n't stand it			1
' @entity70 sings ' @entity15 ? ' a spokesman for the @entity101 said : ' musical hallucination is the sensation of hearing music when none is being played			1
' musical hallucinations have a compelling sense of reality and are often mistaken for real music until it becomes clear that none is being played			2
this is especially true when they are experienced for the first time			0
' they are typically heard as short fragments of simple melodies - often from music heard regularly and familiar from youth , and especially from hymns and carols			0
' individuals with hearing loss sometimes notice that the music in these hallucinations sounds as it did when it was first heard and not how it would with their current level of hearing			0
' the most common and easily treatable cause of musical hallucination is hearing loss , so your doctor is likely to request that you undergo some tests of your hearing and , based on the results of this , may prescribe a hearing aid which many people find makes their musical hallucination less intrusive			1
' according to the @entity101 , around 10 per cent of the adult @entity141 population suffer from a mild form of tinnitus with one per cent saying it affects their quality of life			0
last month former @entity149 guitarist and songwriter @entity148 revealed he was suffering from the condition , adding his name to a long list of high profile tinnitus sufferers including @entity155 's @entity156 and @entity158 's @entity157 .			2
