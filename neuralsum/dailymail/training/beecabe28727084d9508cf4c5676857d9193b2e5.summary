by @entity0 she the @entity2 - born beauty who ’s wowed @entity4 and can call @entity5 and @entity7 close friends			1
in fact , it was at @entity5 ’s estate in @entity11 where she married actor @entity13			2
but ever - modest @entity14 , 31 , maintains that her life is just as chaotic and unglamorous as any other new mother 's			1
back to business : three months after giving birth @entity14 is on the promotion trail for her new action - film @entity20 , with @entity22 praise indeed : apparently @entity24 initiated a meeting with @entity14 after being impressed by her performance in another film and , despite a recent holiday in @entity29 with @entity7 and her fiancé @entity30 , @entity14 says her life is , actually , really quite normal			1
in an interview with @entity32 for @entity33 , the actress , who is currently promoting her new film @entity20 with @entity24 , says : ‘ i do n’t feel i lead a glamorous life			1
most of the people we ’re friends with are people you can just hang out with			0
’ @entity14 , who gave birth to first daughter @entity41 in february , also maintains that the glitzy @entity4 lifestyle is never going to go to her head			1
‘ everybody was asking , “ what ’s your birth plan ? ” ’ she says			2
‘ and i was like , “ i do n’t really have one , to be honest			0
” the nurses were like , “ thank @entity49 ” - they ’re used to women who come in and say , “ i want this music playing when the baby comes out , i want this candle , these flowers … ” ’ just like us : @entity14 and husband @entity13 leave @entity2 hotspot , the @entity57 , on friday night , left			2
right , @entity14 pregnant before the birth of daughter @entity41 in february edge of tomorrow is @entity14 ’s first film since the birth of @entity41 , and one which required a gruelling three - month training regime to get her into shape			1
fortunately , she says , all the filming was done before she became pregnant as she got injured and fell over so often			0
since @entity14 ’s been back in the spotlight , and just three months after the birth of @entity41 , she has noticeably whipped back into shape quickly , though has credited breast - feeding for her slim physique			1
‘ i found that because i managed to produce a lot of milk , i do n't know why , it helped me lose the weight , ’ she told @entity70 recently			0
‘ my boobs thought i had 12 children ! ’ prior to @entity20 , @entity14 is most famous for playing the bitchy and ruthlessly - ambitious assistant in @entity78 , and queen @entity79 in @entity81 , to name but a few staring roles			2
whether it ’s action , comedy or drama , @entity14 ’s career has gone from strength - to - strength , and it was apparently her performance in @entity89 with @entity90 in 2011 that made @entity24 sit up , take notice , and asked his team to arrange an interview			1
hard to believe , then , that @entity14 nearly changed her name when her career started			0
she hated her surname : ‘ because we all know what it rhymes with			0
but my @entity104 agent at the time said , “ do n’t , it ’s so memorable			0
” now , every male actor i work with ends up just calling me “ @entity14			0
