@entity0 are very relaxed amid claims they may have nearly £ 7m of @entity3 prize money withheld @entity0 must not have lost more than £ 35.4m over a period of two seasons but trust in youth development @entity0 's losses for the 2012 - 13 financial year were £ 49.8m , plus £ 41m losses for the 10 - month period through to may 2012			1
however , clubs can use investment in youth development and club infrastructure to offset those figures and @entity0 believe they would have a strong case to present to @entity5 should they be investigated			2
clubs can also use projected revenues when arguing their case and @entity0 figures for the current year are expected to be very healthy			0
