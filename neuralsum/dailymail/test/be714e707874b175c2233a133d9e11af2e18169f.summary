‘ i will often recommend that people put up pictures of what they want to look like or what they used to look like , provided the body image is healthy			0
‘ l ’d hate for someone to put [ their photo ] in and see themselves not the way they are going to look , and get discouraged and disgruntled that they ’re not changing how they ’re supposed to			0
‘ but my first thought upon hearing about this app , was : " it sounds like a really good idea			0
" ' @entity85 ( lost 20lbs/9kg ) @entity85 is seen here before ( left ) and after ( right ) digitally losing 20lbs ( 9kg ) ' at first , i thought it was great			0
the " after " picture looks pretty realistic , which i was n’t actually expecting , and it was amazing to see what i could potentially look like with a few more trips to the gym !

' looks like it ’s time to hit the treadmill … ' @entity105 ( lost 38lbs/17kg ) @entity105 is seen here before before ( left ) and after ( right ) digitally losing 38lbs/17kg ' it was cool to see such a dramatic difference , but i feel as though the app just changed the shape of my face , which is n’t necessarily how i would look nearly 40lbs lighter			2

' i personally did n’t think the app gave a realistic rendering of weight loss			1
' the app allows you to take or upload a photo			0
