by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:17 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 07:16 est , 8 february 2013 ministers were last night accused of breaking promises to reduce plastic bag usage and its devastating impact on the environment by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee			1
despite growing momentum to introduce a charge for the bags , @entity9 said it ‘ may not be the best option ’ due to ‘ pressures on household budgets ’			1
measures to slash the billions of carrier bags handed out by retailers every year were backed by @entity19 , @entity20 and then prime minister @entity21 when the @entity22 launched its ‘ @entity24 ’ campaign in 2008			1
death at sea : ministers were accused of failing to reduce plastic bag usage and its impact on the environment , such as this turtle entangled in a bag , by appearing to dismiss calls to charge a small fee usage initially dropped by 14 per cent , but the issue was then kicked into the long grass by the @entity37 and in 2011 350million more bags were handed out			1
mr @entity19 responded by issuing an ultimatum to supermarkets ordering them to deliver significant falls in numbers or be forced to by law			2
' banish the bags ' : despite momentum to introduce a charge for plastic bags , @entity9 said it ' may not be the best option ' due to ' pressures on household budgets ' a poll last year found a majority of the public would back a charge			1
however mr @entity9 – the minister in charge of the natural environment – laid out objections on cost grounds , despite research showing a fee would make people re-use bags and therefore escape the charge			1
the @entity37 has also raised a plethora of unavoidable green taxes which put a far heavier burden on family finances			0
just three months ago farming minister @entity69 said a charge – which has been successfully introduced in @entity71 at 5p , is coming to @entity72 in april and is being consulted on in @entity73 – would change behaviour in ‘ that very large middle group who want to do the right thing and feel guilty when they do not ’			2
campaigners say plastic carriers are used for an average of just 20 minutes but damage the environment for hundreds of years , killing birds and wildlife which ingest them and blighting beaches			0
dr @entity87 , senior pollution policy adviser at the @entity89 , said : ‘ we are absolutely astounded that @entity9 has come to this decision			1
' our research shows that bag charging is popular and effective			1
’ @entity95 mp @entity94 who backs a charge , said : ‘ i understand the @entity98 's reluctance , but it is important to recognise that no one is asking for a tax			2
' this would be a simple levy that shoppers can easily avoid , and which would be distributed to community groups , not the government			2
wherever it has been applied , it is popular and effective			0
‘ if @entity110 had dropped plastic bags over the side of his boat 500 years ago , there ’s a pretty good chance they would still be floating around intact today			2
we are an extraordinarily wasteful country and of all the waste we generate , the plastic bag is surely the most idiotic			2
’ green mp @entity121 accused the government of ‘ betraying its promise ’ to take action and said the @entity22 ’s campaign had ‘ demonstrated the level of public support for such a measure ’			0
@entity129 of the @entity130 said taxpayers already foot a huge bill for councils to clear up littered bags			0
he said : ‘ carrier bags are not a free resource			0
littered carrier bags find their way everywhere – becoming unsightly and horrible eye - sores right across our countryside , and causing horrible harm to wildlife			0
this is the real price that is being paid			0
’ a poll by @entity147 found 75 per cent of people think a bag charge would cut usage and help to protect the environment , and most -56 per cent – backed a small 5p charge			1
it is understood the @entity98 wanted to block a charge which could raise millions of pounds a year for good causes			1
the @entity156 , @entity157 , insist they have not made a decision yet and are still monitoring the situation in other parts of the @entity161 while ‘ considering all the relevant factors , including the pressure on household budgets at this time ’			0
a number 10 source denied the idea had been axed and said it was ‘ still on the table , and we are looking closely at the situation in other parts of the @entity161 ’			0
taxpayers will foot most of a £ 95,000 bill for a garden featuring an ‘ avenue of dead trees ’ to educate the public about plant diseases			0
@entity157 will use the cash for the feature at the @entity179 in may – despite cuts to flood defences and animal disease controls			0
critics called it a ‘ cock - eyed ’ plan considering 60 experts in forest research have been sacked as part of government cost - cutting			1
effective taxes : research at the @entity89 shows that bag charging is popular and effective , dr @entity87 said			1

@entity9 : introducing a bag charge ' may not be the best option '
a poll last year found a majority of the public would back a charge
mr @entity9 objected on cost grounds , despite research showing a fee would *encourage* people to re-use bags to avoid the charge
