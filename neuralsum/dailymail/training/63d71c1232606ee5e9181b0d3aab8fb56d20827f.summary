by @entity0 , @entity1 saturday was the first time since december 2012 @entity3 lined up without last season 's two leading scorers @entity6 , who was sold to @entity7 in the summer , and @entity8 , out after getting injured on international duty			1
the pair contributed 56 @entity12 goals between them last season as the @entity15 ran champions @entity16 a close second but @entity17 , a Â£ 16million arrival from @entity19 , never looked like coming close to emulating either during the 1 - 0 loss to @entity21 at @entity22			1
goalkeeper @entity23 does not believe the team 's failure to score was purely down to their absences , for one reason or another			2
@entity23 ( second left ) and @entity3 players can only watch on as @entity21 take the lead at @entity22 @entity23 ( left ) believes @entity3 will score goals despite failing to find the net against @entity21 ' i think we have more than enough players in the squad with more than enough ability and different types of players to create chances and score goals , ' he said			1
' i do n't think that is the reason we did n't manage to score			0
it was more about us conceding very early and @entity21 sitting back with two lines of five people , very much like last season against @entity47			2
' i am sure if we got one , there would be more than one , and that is why it is a frustrating night			0
' it is something we have to take on the chin , move on , forget about it and make sure we score some goals on tuesday ( in the @entity15 ' opening @entity59 fixture against @entity62 outfit @entity61 )			2
@entity8 ( pictured ) was unavailable to play for @entity3 against @entity21 due to an injury @entity6 ( pictured ) left @entity3 for @entity7 this summer , meaning the club lost all his goals ' for me it is the first time in the @entity59 so i am looking forward to seeing what it is like			1
' i 've heard the atmosphere inside the stadium is something special so i will look forward to it , but the most important thing is the three points			0
' we have to do our jobs as professional players and get a good result because a good start in the @entity59 is always important			0
' we have to try to forget ( the occasion ) , we have to look at it as a game to get three points and step onto the pitch and do our jobs			0
' once kick - off starts it is a game of 11 men against 11 men			0
' @entity87 ( left ) scores for @entity21 against @entity3 at @entity22 to give his side a 1 - 0 victory			1

@entity3 lost 1 - 0 to @entity21 at @entity22 in @entity12 on saturday
@entity6 *signed* for @entity7 from @entity3 during *transfer* *window*
@entity23 *confident* the side have the players to score this season
@entity23 believes @entity3 must ' make sure ' they score on tuesday
@entity3 face @entity62 champions @entity61 in @entity59
