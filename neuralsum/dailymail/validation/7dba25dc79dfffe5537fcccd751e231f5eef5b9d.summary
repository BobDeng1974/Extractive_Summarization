recording the encounter at home , the video maker waits poised with his hand on the computer mouse as the little mammal named @entity14 watches			1
after flicking his thumb a few times he gets the weasel ’s attention and invites the onslaught from his cute and cuddly attacker			2
the intrigued weasel comes over to its owner after he twiddles his thumb in the hope of getting its attention diving at his thumb , the weasel rolls underneath it and begins nibbling on it as it curls itself up into a ball			1
before retreating , looking around and repeating the process – this time clinging on to the thumb			0
spinning onto its back , @entity14 casually looks at the camera and bares its teeth before flipping back onto all fours with great agility and attacking the man ’s hand once more			1
seconds out , round one ! the weasel feels out its opponent 's thumb before springing into action retreating behind the computer ’s speaker , the weasel runs back and forward in between its rough - and - tumble			1
