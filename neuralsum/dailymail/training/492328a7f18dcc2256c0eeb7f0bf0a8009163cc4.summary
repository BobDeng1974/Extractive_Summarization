by @entity0 tourism authorities in @entity2 have reacted to suggestions that police are instructed to turn a blind eye to extreme sexual behaviour by tourists in the notorious @entity9 resort – and are more interested in protecting the area ’s infamous nightlife than clamping down on unsuitable activities			1
not much left to the imagination : @entity2 has gained new notoriety in recent weeks ( file picture ) the @entity17 sunspot , which sits in the south - west of @entity18 , has been in the spotlight in the last fortnight in the wake of video footage which showed a female @entity24 tourist performing sex acts on 24 different men			1
notorious : scenes of drunkenness are common in the resort area ( file picture ) the incidents took place during an event organised by @entity34 – a company which runs often debauched pub crawls for young holidaymakers on the island			2
however , @entity39 , the head of tourism at the town hall in @entity42 – the @entity2 municipality in which @entity2 is located – insists that the local police do their jobs properly			1
he also argues that the resort is keen to drag its image out of the gutter			2
‘ i do n’t think anyone doubts that the police are doing their job , ’ mr @entity39 says			1
‘ that ’s not our perception			2
’ ‘ what happened [ in the video ] was not acceptable , and we do n’t want out resort to be associated with this kind of behaviour			1
’ mr @entity39 insists that the negative publicity can be blamed firmly on @entity34 – and that the scandal is an isolated incident rather than a sign of a wider problem			0
‘ this has been the irresponsible act of one rogue operator , which could damage the hard work we have been doing in the last years to promote @entity42 , ’ he says			0
since the video emerged , the resort has introduced a new regulation which requires pub - crawl companies to be licensed , and keep numbers of revellers to a maximum of 50			1
however , locals in @entity2 claim that antics such as those seen in the video are widespread , and are effectively condoned by the authorities			1
party capital : @entity2 has been caught in the spotlight since the video footage emerged ( file picture ) ‘ i have seen @entity24 tourists have sex in front of the crowds , without any shame , ’ one taxi driver , who asked not to be named , told the @entity87			1
‘ the only difference is that now mobile phones have cameras and there are social networking sites to post the footage on			1
‘ part of the problem is that the local police look the other way			2
‘ there are a lot of hotel spaces here , and they have to be filled somehow			0
’ scene : the unnamed girl was captured on video working her way through men at @entity113 in @entity2 the company that organised the pub crawl has tried to distance itself from the incident			1
@entity117 , head of @entity118 , says he was appalled by the video			2
' i was disgusted by it			0
disgusted by the young lady who was doing it , ' he commented last week			0
' i ca n't say that my reps encouraged that as that 's not what happened			0
' she should be spoken to by her parents			0
it 's something to do with her upbringing			0
asked whether he felt any responsibility , @entity117 told 5 news : ' i 've no moral responsibility for this – i was n’t even fully aware of it at the time			0
' the girl involved even bought a ticket for the following night ’s carnage tour			0
@entity34 did n’t encourage her , so why should i apologise ? '			0
