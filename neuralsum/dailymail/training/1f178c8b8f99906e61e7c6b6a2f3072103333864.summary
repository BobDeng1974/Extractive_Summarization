by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 04:58 est , 10 december 2012 some people create man caves in their basement , but @entity4 's got a century - old general store , full of brightly colored packages a customer might have found in a general store circa 1900 , give or take a few years			1
@entity4 , a retired electrical contractor , started off with just a wooden stove when he started his collection about 20 years ago			1
but within 10 years , he had built a collection of hundreds of store items			1
colorful : the shelves of @entity4 's basement are filled with an incredible array of bright tobacco tins , with long - gone names such as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 ' i just started buying it up , ' said the decorated @entity26 veteran , who was wounded while serving on a river boat			1
now , it 's all displayed on shelves , counters and cabinets , which also date from many years ago			0
the shelves and boxes hold a dizzying array of tobacco packs of long - gone brands like @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
there 's a curious snuff ball made by @entity44 just down the shelf from tins of @entity47			0
' @entity49 and @entity50 , ' the slogan says			0
comprehensive : @entity4 has hoarded a wide range of general store items ' graphic art ' : @entity4 says he likes the advertising on the packaging on the medicine shelves , @entity4 's got dr. @entity59 's mixture for @entity60 to @entity61 near the section containing @entity63 , along with dozens of other products from @entity65 to toothache drops			1
there 's even a veterinary medicine section , featuring products such as dr. @entity71 's @entity70			0
nearby are tin and paper containers that once held such scary - sounding stuff as @entity75 and @entity76			2
@entity4 did n't neglect food and drink as he built his store collection			1
one unopened box contains @entity81 's @entity80 , just 31 cents			0
veteran : @entity4 served in @entity26 dedication : @entity4 has built up his collection over the last two decades ' i 've even got a case of kite string down there , ' he said			1
a tin sign celebrates a product once made here in @entity92			2
' @entity93 , for your health 's sake , ' just 5 cents a bottle			0
most of the items in the collection are n't worth much on the collector 's market , thanks in part to internet shopping			2
but a few , like his @entity108 chewing gum man , are pretty rare , he said			0
proud : @entity4 shows off his basement but @entity4 built the collection mainly because these products are a kind of history in and of themselves			1
' that 's the thing i like ; the graphic art , ' said @entity4 , pointing to an old wooden cabinet with a colorful lithograph on the front proclaiming ' it 's @entity121 to dye with @entity122			2
' companies were n't spending money on tv , radio or internet advertising 100 years ago , @entity4 said			0
' their advertising is basically on their tins and boxes			0
' attention to detail : the collector inspects an old tobacco tin for a date			0
