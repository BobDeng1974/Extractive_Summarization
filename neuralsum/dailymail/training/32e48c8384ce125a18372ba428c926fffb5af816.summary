in one of the more memorable scenes of the iconic 1980 film ‘ @entity4 , ’ the title characters drive through shopping mall with police not far behind as shocked shoppers run for safety and the whole place ends up trashed			1
throughout the madcap chase , deadpan stars @entity11 and @entity12 calmly point out stores like @entity15 and haircuts and an unrecognizable @entity17			0
they leave behind them a completely wrecked suburban shopping center and that ’s how the place stayed forever after			1
failed : built in 1966 and closed after only 13 years , @entity21 , @entity23 's @entity22 became memorable for good reasons and bad or at least almost forever after			1
according to @entity26 , the memorable moment took place in @entity21 , @entity23 ’s @entity22			2
and after @entity29 left it in shambles , they left town without even cleaning it up			0
a reader called @entity35 , who appears to have personally documented the mall ’s skeletal afterlife as well as its demolition , told the automotive blog the mall had actually closed down in 1979			2
hilarious : @entity11 's character ( right ) notes dryly to @entity12 's ( left ) , ' lots of space in this mall , ' in the indelible scene from the classic movie iconic : the suburban behemoth was the perfect setting for an indoor car chase in the 1980 classic the 800,000 square foot behemoth had only been built 13 years prior , in 1966 on top of what was once a golf course			1
a spike in crime in the area caused it to shut down just before director @entity59 dressed it up for the famous scene and left without picking up after himself			0
‘ once the crew left , ’ wrote @entity35 , ‘ ( the mall in a disastrous state that was never repaired , despite a lawsuit that was ultimately tossed ) , the mall was briefly used as a school , then left to rot from 1981 onward			0
’ what was once a sprawling , $ 25 million mall with three anchor stores and over 60 merchants total became a ‘ bombed out shell			0
’ trashed : the mall was dressed up then wrecked for the scene and left that way for over 20 years by the movie crew and director @entity59 ' @entity79 ' : the 800,000 square foot mall was closed due to a crime spike in the area and quickly went from suburban dream to crime riddled nightmare dangerous : the mall , seen here in its heyday , had 4 anchor stores at 60 merchants but became a magnet for gang activity in its decline for around 20 years , the hot bed of gang activity and vandalism sat untouched			1
by 2003 , @entity22 had become a favorite of photographers and blogs like @entity99 who were fascinated by the monument to the suburban dream turned rotting nightmare			1
after at least one murder , a rape , arsons , roof collapses , and a failed $ 76 million redevelopment attempt , the @entity104 suburb had enough of its infamous landmark			2
the mall was torn down in 2012 using $ 4 million in disaster relief funds given to the state of @entity23 after @entity114 , to be replaced by stand - alone shopping retail stores and restaurants			2
failed : several attempts were made at revitalizing the mall , including a $ 76 million attempt in 2006 , but all of them failed no more : by 2003 , the mall had become a favorite of photographers and bloggers			0
it was finally torn down in 2012			0

@entity22 , one of the first of many more to come in suburban @entity1*30* , began as a *bustling* center of *commerce* but went bust after only 13 years
the 800,000 square foot shopping mall sat *festering* for *30* years as a hot bed of gang activity outside @entity104
