trauma : the teenager was targeted while she was ' vulnerable ' from being separated from her friends an @entity6 man who fled from the @entity7 to begin a new life in @entity9 will spend the next 14 years behind bars after a judge rejected his claim that cultural differences had led to him raping a woman			1
@entity15 , 30 , was told by judge @entity16 in @entity9 that his background as a traumatised @entity19 refugee was no excuse for the rape of a drunken and vulnerable teenager			1
the judge noted that a psychologist had told the @entity25 in @entity9 that @entity15 , who arrived in @entity9 in 2001 , had an ' unclear concept of what constitutes consent in sexual relationships '			1
rejecting that argument , the judge said @entity15 's background and flight from the @entity7 was not an excuse for violence , telling the @entity6 : ' you well knew the victim was not consenting to the act of sexual penetration you performed			1
' it was not the first time that @entity15 had appeared in court on a rape charge - in 2009 he was jailed for a minimum of seven years for the abduction and sexual assault of a woman on @entity48 , 2008 - five days after he had raped the teenager			1
already serving seven years imprisonment for that offence , he was now charged with raping the 18 - year - old who he had found alone , intoxicated and sitting on the pavement near a nightclub after she had had a disagreement with her friends			0
@entity15 , the judge said , had driven from his home that night in december looking for a victim			1
sentence : a judge at @entity63 in @entity9 , pictured , said it was no excuse that @entity15 was traumatised because he had fled the @entity7 attack : the @entity6 refugee raped the drunk teenager after picking her up outside a nightclub in @entity9 , pictured , and driving her to a dark street he sat down beside the teenager , began talking to her and offered to drive her to a hotel where her friends had moved on to			1
but when he drove off in a different direction , the young woman became concerned and texted her friends - until @entity15 took her phone and drove to a dark street			2
the teenager cried and asked if he planned to kill her			0
he replied by putting his hand around her neck and forcing her to remove her clothes before raping her			0
' your offending is of the utmost seriousness , ' said judge @entity16			0
@entity6 women on the streets of @entity89			2
the rapist from @entity6 said ' cultural differences ' contributed to his sex attack ' you preyed upon a young vulnerable stranger who was alone and intoxicated at night			2
your brutal conduct must be denounced by this court			0
' @entity15 , who pleaded guilty to rape , will serve a sentence that includes his jailing for the second sexual attack			2
it was dna from that second offence that led to him being charged with the earlier rape of the teenager			0
with a maximum sentence of 14 years set , he will have to serve a minimum of 11 years and will be eligible for parole in seven years and eight months			0
he is likely to be deported back to @entity6 when he has served his sentence .			0
