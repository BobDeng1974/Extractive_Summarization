by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 04:17 est , 9 october 2013 died : @entity1 , 97 , helped introduce easy - care cotton after @entity3 the inventor who developed wrinkle - resistant cotton has died at the age of 97			1
dr. @entity1 , who created the material in the 1950s , died on saturday at her home in @entity9			1
she is credited with saving the cotton industry as the introduction of synthetic fibres in the 1930s and 1940s led many consumers to turn to the the easy - care fabric			2
the achievement ' is considered one of the most significant technological developments of the 20th century			2
' her obituary in the @entity22 reads : ' a chemist long affiliated with the @entity25 , dr. @entity1 helped perfect modern wrinkle - free cotton , colloquially known as permanent press , in work that she and her colleagues began in the late 1950s , '			1
dr @entity1 grew up in @entity30 , and started at @entity31 of @entity32 at 15			1
the daughter of a civil engineer and an artist , she credited her parents as being her inspiration saying : ' my father was the one who believed in education			2
he said the only thing we would get would be a good education and nobody could take them away from you			0
' her graduation during the @entity50 meant she was forced to take a job in a high school , but she took night classes to earn her master 's degree as well as earning a ph.d. in physical chemistry from the @entity57 in 1948			0
high flier : dr @entity1 grew up in @entity30 , and started at @entity31 of @entity32 at 15 inspiration : she credited her parents with inspiriting her to reach her potential she went to work at the @entity62 @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity63 in @entity30 , where she spent most of her prolific career			1
during the @entity65 she developed a way to deliver fat intravenously to patients who were too ill to eat - a method used to feed seriously wounded soldiers			1
she explained : ' they wanted some emulsion that you could give in addition to glucose that would help the people that were wounded			0
' @entity78 : she married @entity80 in 1950 and went to work at the @entity62 @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity63 in @entity30 invention : dr. @entity1 and her colleagues helped perfect modern wrinkle - free cotton in the late 1950s in the 1950s @entity1 ’s research team began to look into cotton and discovered how to treat cotton fibers so that these chainlike cellulose molecules were chemically joined			1
the @entity90 writes : ' at the time , chemists knew that cellulose molecules could stick to each other by way of hydrogen bonds , but hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken , making cotton fabric prone to wrinkling			0
' the new treatment strengthened the bonds between cellulose molecules by inserting short organic molecules between them , rather like the rungs of a ladder			0
the new product was one enormous molecule with different properties from the original cellulose molecules			0
this “ crosslinking ” made cotton wrinkle - resistant			0
' driven : after her retirement from the @entity62 @entity25 , she went on to teach at the @entity114 until she was 81 the same chemistry also faciliated the ability to incorporate flame retardants into children 's sleepwear , mattresses and uniforms for firefighters and the military			1
but @entity1 repeatedly denied she was the sole inventor of wrinkle - free cotton			2
' i do n’t like it to be said that i invented wash - wear , because there were any number of people working on it , and there are various processes by which you give cotton those properties , ' she said			0
' no one person discovered it or was responsible for it			0
but i contributed to new processes of doing it			0
' in later years , while she continued to research cotton fibers , @entity1 taught classes part - time at @entity32 and at the @entity114			1
she retired from the @entity25 in 1986 but kept on teaching at the @entity114 until she was aged 81			1
her husband , @entity80 , died in 1970			2
at the age of 86 , she received the prestigious @entity146 @entity145 for her work on textiles and her commitment to education			0
legacy : dr @entity1 is credited with saving the cotton industry as the introduction of synthetic fibres in the 1930s and 1940s led many consumers to turn to the the easy - care fabric			2

dr. @entity1 created the material in the 1950s
she died on saturday at her home in @entity9
she taught at the @entity114 until she was 81
also developed a way to deliver fat intravenously to sick patients
