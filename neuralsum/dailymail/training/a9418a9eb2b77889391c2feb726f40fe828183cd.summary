the first laboratory chimpanzees from a south @entity2 research centre have got a taste of the great outdoors after they were ' retired ' to a national sanctuary			1
nine chimps were taken from @entity7 at @entity9 's @entity8 and have been given a sprawling home in the ' @entity12 ' sanctuary in @entity13			1
and as these photos show , the chimps were thrilled - if a little nervous - about their new home			1
it is one of the first of 111 chimpanzees coming to the national sanctuary for chimpanzees getting to know their new home : chimps use sticks to poke into a mock termite mound to taste a sweet substance the curious creatures munched on fruit and explored their new home , larking about in the sunshine and wandering around their wild habitat			2
the research centre , which no longer has an @entity45 chimp research contract , is expected to deliver seven more tomorrow and a further 95 will make their way to the outdoor haven in the following months , according to @entity49			1
the huge research centre , which has ' 6,000 non-human primates representing eight species ' studies and tests chimps for ' research aimed at promoting human quality of life			1
' excited to be outside cheeky chimp hatching a plan play with me ! a baby chimp rolls around in the grass as the chimps get to know their new home the @entity45 proposal calls for major cuts in grants to study chimps in laboratories on its website it says that it ' specializes in the breeding , management , and importation of a diverse range of nonhuman primate species '			2
the laboratory ' offers a broad range of diagnostic , laboratory , and human resources for the development and characterization of nonhuman primate models for applied and basic research			2
a @entity45 committee is recommending that all but about 50 of the agency 's hundreds of research chimpanzees should be retired to the outdoor sanctuary , which was created on 200 acres of a @entity91 park			1
the @entity45 proposal , which will go to the agency 's director after a 60 - day public consultation period , also calls for major cuts in grants to study chimps in laboratories			2
it also calls for labs to maintain their policy of not breeding the great apes for research			0
two chimps tussle for food at @entity12 in @entity13 , where they 'll have wide open acres to play in and enjoy the rest of their lives nuts about nuts : as one chimp tucks in , a committee is recommending that all but about 50 of the agency 's research primates should be retired to the outdoor sanctuary towering trees and 20 - ft play structures offer climbing , swinging and resting places for the retired chimps @entity123 , the @entity125 ' vice-president for animal research issues , said the sanctuary is the most ' appropriate ' place for the animals , and was disappointed that there was a recommendation to retain 50 of the creatures			1
she said : ' i 'm glad they made clear those animals should be kept to much higher standards than they are currently being kept in			0
' a $ 30 million cap on total spending for construction and care of @entity12 's retirees has been looming , @entity49 reported			0
@entity123 said the @entity142 will urge @entity143 to move money now spent on research contracts to @entity12			0
the sanctuary gives the animals better care for less money than the labs are paid , she said			0
the @entity12 boasts groundcover , trees , and climbing structures provide a stimulating environment crucial for the primates ' development and rehabilitation			0
the chimpanzees can make sleeping nests from vegetation provided by staff or they can build nests from the trees and plants found in the wooded habitat			0
towering trees and 20ft play structures offer climbing , swinging and resting places for the chimps , who will be able to do whatever they please in their new home .			0
