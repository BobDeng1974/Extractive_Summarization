while most newlyweds dream of falling into a hammock and doing precisely nothing immediately after their ' @entity5 ' one young @entity4 couple decided that a regular honeymoon just was n't romantic enough for them			1
instead @entity7 and @entity8 decided to pool their savings , quit their jobs and embark upon an epic adventure that turned into the world 's longest honeymoon			1
covering six continents , 33 countries and 302 places in 675 days the holiday of a lifetime included 57,397 overland miles , 226,152 photographs , 110 hikes , 105 buses , 46 jars of peanut butter , 41 safaris and 39 scuba dives			1
so we thought , we could take this nest egg and buy a house or a car , or we can do something that most people wait to do until they 're retired			2
' why not do this in our late twenties and early thirties , and we 'll have these amazing memories rest of our lives ? ' and in true modern traveller style , the media - savvy @entity56 blogged their every movement to their 15,000 online fans ( check them out on @entity62 / @entity61 )			2
using @entity8 ’s background as a magazine editor and @entity7 ’s as a media strategist and photographer the couple launched the @entity68 blog to share the experience with friends and family			1
@entity73 charm : dancing on @entity74 in @entity75 milestone : celebrating 500 days while travelling to @entity77 from @entity78 matching outfits : going green in @entity81 , @entity82 starting in @entity84 , they moved through @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , sharing snaps and updates with their followers on social media as they went			1
their travel philosophy was to go to places too far to visit while they have jobs and too rugged to tackle when they are old			2
their favourite place was @entity100 ( formerly @entity100 ) for the friendly people and fascinating blend of styles and cultures			1
@entity7 also fell in love with @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108			2
he said : ' only one or two people before us had stayed in the property			2
they built a loft above an actual vineyard , and brought in a @entity115 treehouse architect			2
to get to the room , you go through the vines , off this ladder , and into this vineyard loft			0
there was a big @entity123 tub out on the porch			0
it was really great drinking wine there , having a vineyard loft experience			0
' the couple say there are too many memories to list them all , but also highlighted having a cheetah jump on top of their open - roof safari vehicle in the @entity35 in @entity36 , wreck diving the @entity137 ships in @entity138 , @entity139 and watching the @entity140 from the @entity141 in @entity142 as highlights of their immense trip			1
and , maybe surprisingly for some married couples out there , they both say that the trip has made their relationship stronger			1
in an interview during the trip with @entity8 said : ' people were like , " you must really like your husband			1
i do n't think i could spend that much time with mine			0
" it made me , think , " yeah , i do really love him			0
i think it 's going to be okay , right ? " ' you start to bond on a level that is not possible on a regular schedule			0
your brain starts to fuse and you can sense each other 's needs or humor or reactions			0
we play off of each other really well			0
' @entity7 added : ' we 've just become even better husband and wife than when we started			0
it 's so amazing to have someone to share those experiences with , and the next day laugh about the scary thing that happened and become stronger for it			1
' wrapped up : at the @entity179 , @entity180 here we go ! : the couple take off on the @entity183 over @entity184 in @entity185 , which has a 160ft free - fall a private view : at @entity188 in @entity189 the couple set up a blog called @entity61 to share their adventures @entity7 and @entity8 are now turning their passion for travel into a business , offering bespoke advice to travellers wanting to follow in their footsteps through trip coach a one - on - one guide to world travel			1
they say : ' we did our 675 - day trip around the world for just under $ 40 per person per day , including flights , food , lodging , activities … the works			1
this is an average of the pricier countries like @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity142 ( $ 75 per day ) with the less expensive places like @entity78 and @entity86 ( $ 20 per day )			1
traveling around the world turned out to be less expensive than the mortgage on our apartment			0
' we were really scrappy on the road when not in nice resorts , which was maybe two times per month			0
we did all overland travel , and very few flights — and when we did fly , it was on miles			0
' we also took shared vans and local transport			0
our top travel tips include : - have separate credit and debit card accounts in case one disappears - pack the right technology ; it ’s the hardest thing to get on the road - buy your flights as you go ... an around - the - world plane ticket will cost more and severely limit your flexibility ' we would also say always travel overland via local transportation whenever possible as we think that is one of the most valuable experiences we 've had on our entire trip			1
you miss so many things when you fly ; on land , you see the scenery and the stops and the food stalls and the guys motorbiking through the rice fields and how locals live along the way			0
' check out trip coach , a one - on - one guide to world travel combining their knowledge and passion and offering bespoke advice to anyone looking to explore the world			1

' holidays and honeymoons are often too rushed as trying to pack everything in at once			0
here 's five ways to make the most of your trip : 1			1
planning - make sure you use websites , guide books and friends to find out what 's best and what can be missed in the city2			0
get out early - carpe diem ! you 'll get the most out of your trip by getting out of bed			2
look for homestays and flat shares - if you want a taste of local culture , homestays are a great way to experience the local culture first hand4			0
get flight ready - keep flight day stress to minimum by checking in online , and try to take minimal luggage.5			2
