they may look like inventions straight out of a sci - fi film , but this collection of designs were very much real and developed in a top - secret @entity6 war lab more than 70 years ago			1
@entity7 1 , also known as ‘ @entity8 ’ , was a weapons laboratory set up in 1939 by @entity10 - a firm believer in the importance of science and technology in warfare			1
he encouraged his scientists to trial even the most absurd of inventions - many of which never made it beyond the drawing board - but some were so successful that they played a vital role in ending @entity23			1
@entity10 was the @entity33 candidate for @entity34 , @entity35 , but lost in the elections 1			2
the @entity37 : a giant wheel covered in rockets the @entity40 was a series of robust fortifications built after 1942 by the @entity43 to defend against an anticipated @entity45 invasion			1
@entity10 was born in @entity46 into the blue - blooded dynasty of the @entity48			1
he was an enthusiastic soldier , fighting in several wars before entering politics			2
@entity10 was made prime minister of @entity6 in may 1940			2
he survived several strokes in later life , and on his death , he had one of the largest state funerals in history			2
it posed a significant obstacle for @entity60 , and so a potential solution to create a breach large enough to allow a vehicle through was dreamed up by one of @entity66 ’s military think - tanks			1
the panjandrum was an unlikely - looking weapon , made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle			1
cordite rockets were to propel it at predicted speeds of up to 60 miles ( 97km ) per hour , which even without the deadly force of the explosives it carried , was pretty terrifying considering it weighed around 4,000lbs ( 1,800kg )			2
after extensive trials , the prototype had a disastrous final test in which it veered dangerously off course and disintegrated in the sea			2
the panjandrum , pictured , was an unlikely - looking weapon , made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle 2			1
the time pencil : a hidden detonator with sights on the @entity91 otherwise known as ‘ pencil detonators ’ or officially as ‘ switch , @entity93 , delay ’ , these were pencil - shaped timed fuses with a vial of corrosive copper chloride at one end			1
they were inserted into explosives and used as a ' time delay ' to set off a bomb			2
they could be set to delay for between 10 minutes and 24 hours			2
to activate it , the vial was crushed so the copper chloride would begin to dissolve a metal wire			2
once the wire snapped , it released a spring that propelled a striker down the hollow tube to the percussion cap , to detonate the explosives it had been inserted into			2
these were used extensively during covert operations by the @entity117 in @entity118			2
one of these detonators was used in the 20 july plot of 1944 , in the briefcase - bomb attempt to kill @entity122			1
this hidden detonator used a vial of corrosive copper to dissolve a metal wire , propelling a ' striker ' down a hollow tube and detonating explosives the pencil was attached to 3			0
the @entity131 : like a sea mine , but with a man attached the idea of using a human torpedo to attach explosive charges had been around since the end of @entity138			1
@entity10 ’s version was attached by frogmen who used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs ( two kilograms ) of explosive to an enemy ship , capable of punching a large hole in the hull			0
divers would carry the limpet mines underwater and attach them to ships , causing devastating damage when they exploded			1
they were used in the war to devastating effect			0
seven @entity154 ships were sunk or disabled by @entity45 commandos alone , using limpet mines in @entity157 , 1943			1
@entity10 ’s ' human torpedo ' used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs ( two kilograms ) of explosive to an enemy ship , capable of punching a large hole in the hull you can read more about @entity10 's ' mad science ' in issue 22 of all about history 4			1
@entity167 : a giant iceberg @entity168 steel and aluminium were at a premium during the war , so when inventor @entity175 , who worked at @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , was considering a way of protecting @entity40 convoys beyond the reach of aircraft cover , he realised the answer was ice			0
specifically , he considered creating huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway			0
the problem was that icebergs tend to roll over , so @entity175 ’s answer was a combination of wood pulp and ice , which he called ‘ pykrete ’			0
this would n’t sink , was much stronger than ice and would n’t shatter , so it could easily be carved into shape			0
however , it never came into being			0
@entity175 encountered a series of engineering problems that ultimately required the use of some steel in @entity204			0
@entity205 , the invention of long - range aircraft fuel tanks and the use of airfields in the @entity210 made it redundant			1
@entity175 's radical idea was to build huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway - although they never came into being 5			1
the sticky bomb : a @entity219 ( @entity220 ) ca n’t @entity218 this was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs ( half a kilogram ) of nitroglycerine , covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal			0
its handle contained a five - second fuse and a safety pin that , upon being pulled , released the metal casing and exposed the adhesive			1
the adhesive was added to allow the bomb to remain attached to an enemy tank for the few seconds of delay before the bomb exploded			0
in theory , the sticky bomb could be attached to a passing tank , although in practice tanks often proved too dirty or wet for the bombs to stick			0
despite this , 2.5 million were made and used between 1940 and 1943			0
the @entity244 is shown being assembled in 1943			0
this was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs ( half a kilogram ) of nitroglycerine , covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal 6			0
artificial @entity253 : a pop - up invasion aid to bring the @entity255 ‘ mulberries ’ , or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known , were portable , temporary harbours designed specifically in @entity23 to help the @entity60 unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large - scale invasion			1
in the years leading up to the d - day landings , it had become apparent that any attempt to land en masse on the @entity40 coastline of @entity267 would require the use of the @entity270 harbours			1
and to do that , the @entity60 would need to depend on penetrating the @entity272 , which could not be done			0
instead , the @entity259 were to be transported and assembled off the @entity270 coast , providing mobile port facilities including cranes , roads and piers			0
‘ @entity280 ’ and ‘ @entity281 ’ were successfully used for the invasion of @entity279 in june 1944			0
the @entity282 was destroyed by storms but the @entity284 served for six months after @entity285 before being decommissioned			0
‘ mulberries ’ ( one pictured ) , or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known , were portable , temporary harbours designed specifically in @entity23 to help the @entity60 unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large - scale invasion 7			1
the piat : a one - man @entity293 ( when it hit anything ) by the middle of @entity23 enemy tanks had become increasingly well armoured , to the point that they were impenetrable to the outdated infantry grenade launchers			1
@entity301 , @entity302 , anti-tank ( @entity292 ) was a portable mortar system that used a powerful spring to arm and launch a bomb weighing 2.5lbs ( 1.1kg ) with a shaped charge up to 360ft ( 110 metres ) away			0
they were first issued to @entity6 forces in 1943 and used throughout the war by the @entity60			0
although not entirely reliable , they were quite capable of taking out enemy tanks when they hit their targets and detonated			0
you can read more about ' @entity66 : @entity6 's mad scientist ' in issue 22 of @entity316 , on sale now @entity301 , @entity302 , anti-tank ( @entity292 ) was a portable mortar system designed to help @entity6 soldiers battle @entity321 tanks - and when they hit , they were very successful			1

' @entity8 ' operated out of @entity323 at first in @entity23
eventually it moved to a mansion in the *countryside* to avoid air raids
the top - secret weapons lab developed some *groundbreaking* weapons
these included the human limpet mine and a rocket - powered wheel
