by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 19:47 est , 28 august 2012 hit out : @entity2 deputy leader @entity1 has hit out at discrimination against older women @entity2 deputy leader @entity1 has hit out at discrimination against older women , warning it was leading to a generation of ‘ passive participants ’ in public life			1
miss @entity1 , who is also shadow culture secretary , said many viewers were females of a certain age who themselves ‘ do n’t want to be written out of the public domain ’			0
speaking at @entity13 at the weekend she said it was ‘ offensive and wrong ’ that women were made invisible ‘ because you are past your reproductive age ’			0
she said the treatment of @entity19 , the former @entity21 judge , who was dumped off the show , was ‘ symbolic ’ , adding ‘ something needs to be done about it ’			0
the @entity2 mp said the ‘ discrimination ’ against older women did not apply to older men who kept working and were treated as ‘ venerable , experienced and sage ’			1
the @entity28 has been the focus of controversy about the treatment of older women in broadcasting in recent years , with former @entity35 presenter @entity34 winning an ageism case against the corporation last year and the earlier row over ditching miss @entity19 from @entity21			1
earlier this year @entity28 director general @entity39 admitted there were not enough older women on television			2
the soon - to - leave chief admitted the corporation had a ‘ case to answer ’ over the lack of female presenters - especially in ‘ iconic roles ’ and there were ‘ manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the @entity28 ’			2
broadcasting veterans such as @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 have been among many female voices who have attacked the treatment of women on tv			0
criticism has included the fact that older male performers such as @entity62 are allowed to carry on into their later year , unlike many of their female counterparts			0
tackling inequality : former @entity35 presenter @entity66 ( left ) with @entity67 , a discrimination expert who won an ageism case against the @entity28 miss @entity1 ’s comments came as she appeared at a ‘ @entity72 ’ session at the tv festival			2
a member of the audience asked if in the wake of the @entity34 case whether people were ‘ too obsessed ’ about gender and age on tv			0
the long - serving politician said ‘ no ’ and replied : ‘ the reality is that there is a particular form of discrimination against older women which does n’t apply to older men who are regarded as venerable , experienced , sage and does n’t apply to younger women but uniquely applies to older women			1
‘ i think that what we have got in this country is a new generation of older women who have done things very differently from their mothers , played a different role in the family , played a different role in the workplace , have had different educational aspirations			1
women in broadcasting : the sacking of women such as @entity19 ( pictured with other judges on @entity21 ) was ' symbolic ' of the discrimination @entity107 said ‘ the idea that you have to be written out of the public domain because you are past your reproductive age is really offensive and wrong			1
the whole thing about @entity19 as well was very symbolic and actually it needs to be addressed			0
’ she added : ‘ a lot of people watching the @entity28 are older women themselves who do n’t want to be written out of the public domain and if you look across the senior positions the idea that you have got a country where you have got younger women and older men , but otherwise older women have just got to be passive participants , it is not the reality and something needs to be done about it definitely			1
’ at the same event she attacked @entity130 ’s first minister @entity129 for unrealistic proposals to split up the @entity28 .			0
