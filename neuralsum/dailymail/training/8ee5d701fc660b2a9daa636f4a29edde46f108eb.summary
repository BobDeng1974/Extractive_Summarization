by @entity0 published : 03:06 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 03:06 est , 24 july 2012 scientists have successfully tested a new drug treatment for tuberculosis which could be an effective weapon against increasingly resistant forms of the disease			0
the combination of three drugs killed 99 per cent of patients ' tuberculosis bacteria in two weeks			0
' the results of this clinical trial give us the first indication that a new @entity15 drug regimen - a combination of drugs - could be more effective than any of the existing tb drug regimens , ' said dr @entity19 , chief executive officer of the @entity20 , a non-profit research group that conducted the study			1

the disease killed 1.7million in 2009 he said the combination is especially promising because it could be used to treat patients with both treatment - sensitive tb and tb strains that are resistant to two or more of the common drugs , known as multiple - drug resistant @entity15			1
the cocktail includes one existing tb drug , pyrazinamide , a repurposed antibiotic from @entity36 called moxifloxcin that is now used off - label for patients with drug - restistant @entity15 , and a new drug called @entity41 being developed by the @entity42 - based @entity20			1
the findings , published in @entity44 , come as the @entity15 bacterium @entity46 tuberculosis is rapidly developing resistance to the world 's most effective tools			2
standard treatment for @entity15 usually includes a mix of four drugs over a period of six months and multi-drug resistant @entity15 can take 18 to 24 months to treat			1
since most of the disease is cleared in the first few months , people often do not finish their full regimen of @entity15 drugs , which can lead to drug resistance , making @entity15 more dangerous and more difficult to treat			1
according to the @entity63 , in some parts of the world , one in four people with @entity15 has a form of the disease that can no longer be treated with standard drug cocktails			1
even more deadly forms of @entity15 are emerging			2
dr @entity68 of the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , has identified more than a dozen cases of @entity15 that can not be killed by any existing form of treatment			1
@entity15 kills an estimated 1.4 million people each year , and some 9 million people are newly infected			1
tuberculosis virus : some strains of the disease are becoming increasingly resistant to drug combinations in the mid-stage study conducted at two sites in @entity84 , researchers tested the drug combination on 85 patients with @entity15			1
after two weeks , they found the new treatment combination was 99 per cent effective at killing off tb bacteria in these patients			0
a follow - up study of the treatment testing the drug combination over a two - month period already has begun and should be completed next year , dr @entity19 said			0
once that study is done , the group hopes to start large - stage clinical trials			0
' the results look strongly promising from this early trial , ' said dr @entity99 , director of the @entity63 's @entity100			0
' if further trials hold up , we may have a major solution for drug - sensitive tb and drug - resistant tb			0
' the study was funded by the @entity106 , the @entity107 and the @entity109 and @entity110 governments			0
the study , which needs to be confirmed in larger and longer trials , was presented at the @entity112 in @entity113			0
the new treatment does n't contain any drugs in the class called rifamycins , which pose the greatest threat of side effects for patients who also are being treated for infections with @entity122 , the human immunodeficiency virus that causes @entity123			0
dr @entity19 said : ' @entity15 is the largest killer of @entity123 patients , and so in order to contain the @entity123 epidemic , we have to contain @entity15 to a much greater extent			2

in some countries one in four people with @entity15 has a form that can no longer be treated with standard drug cocktails
