a family told of their horror at being threatened with jail by the @entity4 which falsely accused them of animal cruelty and insisted that their beloved family cat be put to sleep			1
@entity9 and his wife @entity10 suffered two years of trauma after an @entity4 inspector seized their cat , 16 - year - old @entity14 , in may 2013 claiming that he was too thin and had matted fur			1
after 24 hours of agonising negotiations @entity14 was put to sleep by a local vet against the wishes of @entity20 and mrs @entity21 who were threatened with prison if they refused to sign the release form			1
in the months that followed the @entity4 issued proceedings against the family for animal cruelty which saw mr @entity9 , an accountant at @entity42 , repeatedly dragged to court to plead his innocence			1
on friday , more than two years after @entity14 ’s untimely death and after spending around £ 5,000 on legal representation , the @entity44 ruled there was not enough evidence to proceed and the case was dismissed			1
speaking yesterday mr @entity9 condemned the aggressive approach of the charity and spoke of the trauma his family had suffered after being treated ‘ like criminals			1
’ he also spoke of his fear that many other loving , law - abiding pet owners could find themselves in the same situation as a result of what he called the charity ’s ‘ bullying tactics ’ and added that any legal costs he may be awarded will come not from the charity but from central funds meaning the tax payer foots the bill			0
he said : ‘ there is no risk for them in prosecuting cases like this , so if they lose the tax payer picks up the bill			0
@entity14 had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted the couple 's daughter @entity21 ( pictured with @entity14 ) was not allowed to say her final goodbyes to cat ‘ after all we have been through there is no negative impact on them at all			1
’ mr and mrs @entity21 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , adopted @entity14 from a friend as a six - month - old kitten when they moved to the rural town in the late nineties			2
they went on to have two children , @entity28 , 15 , and @entity26 , 13 , but always regarded @entity14 as ‘ the original member of the family			2
’ @entity14 , a long - haired breed of cat with fine but extremely thick hair , had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted			1
at first mr @entity9 , 53 , coped with this by taking him to local vets who would give him an anaesthetic before trimming him			2
but after few times this was stopped as the vets feared that regularly subjecting him to a general anaesthetic would do more harm than good			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ from about 2003 on we were left to do it ourselves , i would let him sit on me and stroke him until he fell asleep and then @entity115 would carefully snip away the worst bits of his fur			2
‘ the only thing that worked through his hair were hairdressing scissors and so she would sit there hour after hour snipping away			0
@entity14 was in good health at the time of his death and mr @entity9 is still fighting to be given back his ashes ‘ the irony that she should be accused of animal neglect after the care she gave that animal - it could n’t be further from the truth			1
’ after a neighbour complained about his appearance an @entity4 inspector visited the family in june 2012 and mr @entity9 agreed to monitor the animal ’s health since he was now approaching old age			1
but after another complaint the same inspector returned in june 2013 and convinced mrs @entity21 to allow her to take their cat to the vets for a checkup			2
she took @entity14 to a different vet than the one normally used by @entity20 and mrs @entity21 and called back within an hour to say he would have to be put down immediately			1
initially the couple refused to sign the paperwork to allow the procedure and were told to attend a meeting with the vet and the @entity4 the next morning			1
that night , lost as to what to do next , mr @entity9 typed in ‘ @entity4 bullying ’ to an internet search engine and discovered a charity called the @entity157 which advises people being prosecuted by the @entity4			1
they told him to tape every conversation he had with charity and to seek legal representation - he believes that it is only as a result of that taped evidence that he escaped prosecution			0
in the meeting the couple found themselves threatened with court action and the police if they did comply with the charity ’s demands			2
in a transcript from the meeting the inspector says : ‘ if you two do n’t authorise that the vet can euthanise @entity14 then there is the option of overriding that decision where i can go to the police , who will authorise it for me			2
‘ you can also end up with a fine or potential imprisonment			0
imprisonment is very rare but because it ’s being dealt with by magistrates ’ court that is an option			0
’ on friday the @entity44 ruled there was not enough evidence to proceed and the couple 's case was dismissed the couple found themselves threatened with court and police action if they did not comply to charity 's rules mr @entity9 added : ‘ we came under increasing pressure to sign the forms , she [ the inspector ] said things like “ the law is on my side ” and “ i do n’t want to but i know i can force you to sign			1
” ‘ i did n’t want to the police involved so in the end i signed it , @entity115 to her eternal credit refused			0
‘ then we asked if we could take him home for one last night so the kids could say goodbye to him but they refused			0
‘ we asked if they could even just delay it until 4 o’clock so we could pick them up from school - the vet was about to agree this and then the inspector interrupted and said it had to be done immediately			0
‘ i thought my daughter would never speak to me again			0
’ the procedure went ahead and following a last minute request by the @entity4 in april this year that a post-mortem be carried out , the family were never even allowed to have his body back to bury him in the back garden as they wished			2
in a final insult the examination only served to prove the defence case that despite being underweight @entity14 was in relatively good health at the time of his death and mr @entity9 is still fighting to be given back his ashes			1
now he also wishes to warn other pet owners in the hope that others can be spared the ordeal that he went through			0
he added : ‘ we could have ended up with a criminal record for the rest of our lives for something we did n’t even do and there was no - one there to help us			0
‘ the @entity4 is the only non-statutory body that can bring their own prosecutions , even the @entity252 has to collect evidence and then submit it to the @entity44 to make a decision , how can this be allowed ? ’ yesterday the @entity4 maintained they brought the case against the @entity256 as a result of ‘ very real serious concerns about the welfare of @entity14			1
’ it added that the family agreed in writing to having him put down and that the charity ‘ only undertakes prosecutions where it considers there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so			0
’ however this is the second time this year that the state has been forced to intervene to prevent the charity from prosecuting a cat owner			0
in another incident the @entity44 halted a case after police broke down the door of an autistic woman ’s home to remove a cat she refused to give up			2
like the @entity256 they ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute @entity281 , 49 , who was later reunited with her pet after an eleven month battle			0
