by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 7 december 2012 @entity1 ignited outrage in @entity3 on thursday by voting to empower the @entity4 to punish @entity5 implicated in human rights abuses			1
the @entity7 approved the measure , which has already passed the @entity9 , in a sweeping 92 - to - 4 vote			0
as it was originally crafted , the legislation was meant to strengthen @entity4 relations with @entity5 by finally lifting @entity14 - era restrictions on trade relations			1
the restrictions were adopted in the 1970s as a means of punishing communist countries			0
without them , trade with @entity5 is expected to double			0
the provision is dubbed the ' @entity35 ' after @entity36 , a lawyer who died in @entity5 custody in 2009 after alleging that government officials had conspired in a $ 230 million tax fraud scheme			0
@entity41 rage : ' it is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the @entity4 , where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century , ' the @entity21 wrote in a series of furious remarks on its official @entity41 feed the @entity5 @entity21 described the provision thursday as ' nothing but a vindictive desire to counter @entity5 in world affairs			1
' ' it is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the @entity4 , where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century , ' the @entity21 wrote in a series of furious remarks on its official @entity41 feed			1
' apparently , @entity56 has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the @entity14 is going on			2
' the @entity21 said the @entity4 has no right to weigh in on the @entity5 government 's internal affairs			2
' the @entity4 decision to impose visa and financial sanctions on certain @entity5 citizens is like something out of the theatre of the absurd , ' the @entity21 wrote			2
' obviously , @entity4 passage of the " @entity35 " will adversely affect the prospects of bilateral cooperation			0
' by contrast , sen. @entity69 , a @entity70 from @entity71 , said @entity1 has every right to keep @entity3 in check when it comes to human rights			1
' this culture of impunity in @entity5 has been growing worse and worse , ' @entity69 said			1
' there are still many people who look at the @entity35 as @entity81			0
i believe it is pro-russia			0
' ' ultimately passing this legislation will place the @entity4 squarely on the side of the @entity5 people and the right side of @entity5 history , which appears to be approaching a crossroads			0
' the measure now goes to president @entity91 , who will likely sign it , even though he believes the trade bill should be considered separately from the human rights provision			2
defense : sen. @entity69 hit back against critics of the measure , saying it would put the @entity4 on ' the right side of @entity5 history '			1

@entity101 would empower @entity4 to freeze assets of @entity5 implicated in human rights abuses
@entity5 @entity21 *lashes* out against measure on @entity41
says @entity56 ' still thinks the @entity14 is going on '
sen. @entity69 hits back , says ' culture of impunity in @entity5 is growing worse and worse '
