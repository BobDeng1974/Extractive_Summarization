by @entity1 reporter published : 09:59 est , 23 june 2012 updated : 01:52 est , 25 june 2012 patients with life threatening conditions are struggling to get hold of drugs in 80 % of @entity9 trusts in @entity10 and @entity11 , a survey suggests			1
four out of five trusts are reporting delays because medicines intended for @entity9 patients are exported to other @entity17 countries			1
quotas have been introduced to control the amount of drugs set aside for the @entity9 but this has been found to exacerbate the problem			1
shortages : delays are reported in four out of five trusts because medicines intended for @entity9 patients are exported to other @entity17 countries @entity28 mp @entity27 is calling for action from both the government and industry , after more than 60 health authorities responded to his freedom of information request about drug shortages			1
the member for @entity36 in @entity11 wrote on @entity37 : ' not good enough : over 60 responses from health authorities show gov't & industry need to act on medicine shortages			0
' the @entity43 said it is considering an investigation into the scale of the problem			1
a spokesman said : ' it is for manufacturers to ensure that any quotas set are flexible enough to cope with reasonable fluctuations in demand			0
where quotas are used , companies setting them should also make sure that they are set fairly			0
' manufacturers should have their own contingency arrangements in place for pharmacies to be able to obtain medicines directly if they have problems getting hold of them			2
@entity27 mp is calling for action after 60 health authorities responded to a survey about health authorities ' the government does maintain a buffer stock of certain essential medicines that can be released in emergencies			2
we will take any action necessary in the event of disruption to supply and distribution of medicines that causes serious risk to patients			1
' in april health minister @entity80 told @entity81 that the department is considering a one - off survey of shortages of medicines at local pharmacies			2
last month @entity87 in the @entity88 published a report on their inquiry into medicine shortages , which found that the problem is caused principally by the export of medicines intended for @entity9 patients to other @entity17 countries			1
the practice is legal under @entity99 provisions for the free movement of goods			0
the shortages are worsened by attempts by those in the supply chain to solve the problem through quotas and other alternative supply mechanisms , the report said			2
pharmacists then spend long periods of time sourcing medicines in short supply , meaning they have less time to spend with patients			1
also , patients were found to be suffering as a result of the shortages , with the group citing examples where those with serious conditions such as epilepsy , schizophrenia and diabetes are unable to get crucial medicines when they need them			1
there were also incidents of people being admitted to hospital as a direct result of medicine shortages			0
the problem , ongoing for four years , is said to be getting worse , despite attempts by the @entity43 to address it			1
the @entity87 said the government could take action as there is scope within @entity99 legislation for it to exempt certain goods if their free movement threatened public health			0
but the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) defended the use of quotas as a legitimate means of ensuring @entity146 patients receive the medicines they need			1
their aim is to ensure that pharmacists do not present excessive orders to be fulfilled			0
@entity141 chief executive @entity151 said : ' we know that quotas are not the perfect answer to the problem : they are a sticking plaster not a cure			2
in april health minister @entity80 told @entity81 that the department is considering a one - off survey of shortages of medicines at local pharmacies ' there have been occasions where manufacturers have received orders for medicines which represent more than the entire @entity146 requirement for one particular medicine in one go			0
in one example a manufacturer received orders equivalent to 26 years ' worth of the entire @entity146 supply within a three - month period for one medicine			0
' if orders of this excess were fulfilled then we would be left with no stock available for other @entity146 pharmacists and patients would n't have access to the medicines they need , when they need them			2
' if all the medicines manufacturers provided went to @entity146 pharmacists , they would have in excess of what they need , but while these medicines continue to flow out of the @entity146 these problems will persist			0
and make no mistake , patients will be affected			0
' removing quotas would not benefit patients but it could cause great harm			0
the only group who would benefit are the small percentage of pharmacists and wholesalers who actively sell medicines intended for @entity146 patients abroad for a profit			1

delays are reported in four out of five trusts because medicines intended for @entity9 patients are exported to other @entity17 countries
