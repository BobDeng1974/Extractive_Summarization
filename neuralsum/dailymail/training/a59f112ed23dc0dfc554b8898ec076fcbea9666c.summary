a mystery donor responsible for thousands of rubber ducks found with cash strapped to them across the world has been revealed - as a charity started by a @entity7 mum			1
more than 2,300 of the yellow bath toys have popped across the globe in 56 countries including @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
bewildered people have been picking up the ducks and finding up to £ 50 attached to them along with a message asking them to spread on the goodwill when they can			1
@entity23 began the project after she lost her daughter @entity25 ( pictured ) , who loved the little yellow ducks , to @entity27 in april last year hundreds of people who have found the ducks have then left them elsewhere with the same message attached - and the craze spread globally			1
now @entity23 , founder of @entity31 , has now stepped forward to unravel the mystery			1
the mother began the project after she lost her daughter @entity25 to @entity27 in april last year			1
she , along with the rest of @entity25 's family and friends , started handing out ducks to strangers around her hometown in @entity41 , @entity42			1
each one had a message asking the finders to visit @entity46 where they can find out information about organ donation and register their duck as found			2
people have been picking up the ducks and finding cash attached to them ( pictured ) along with a message asking them to spread on the goodwill but the craze has since spiralled out of control and people have been carrying on the act of kindness by leaving the ducks in public places with gifts or money attached to them as well as inspirational messages			1
incredibly , more than 2,300 ducks have been registered on the website 's interactive map but thousands more are expected to be unregistered after they were passed on without the website address			2
@entity23 said : ' my daughter @entity25 was crazy about little yellow ducks			1
she had a duck umbrella , duck scarf , duck toys and even duck slippers			2
' @entity25 suffered with cystic fibrosis			1
she was waiting for a double lung transplant , but sadly we did n't find a donor in time and aged 26 , she passed away			0
' her corneas were donated to a young man and woman so that they could see again			0
it was an incredible gift and it made me think about other ways i could honour @entity25 's memory			1
more than 2,300 of the yellow bath toys have popped across the globe in 56 countries including @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 which have been registered online with the charity ( pictured ) ' on the anniversary of her death i handed out rubber ducks to strangers in our town centre			1

' the latest duck to be found was discovered outside a @entity109 restaurant in @entity110 , @entity111 , last week with a £ 50 note strapped to it			1
a message attached to it read : ' i 'm a duck and i have a present for you			0
why not buy a friend a coffee , or treat yourself - you can do whatever you want			0
' but keep me in your pocket , and when you can , put something else under me and hide me in town for someone else to find and benefit from your kindness			0
' office worker @entity127 , 44 , said he found one next to a pub with a letter and a £ 10 note in the same town			1
the charity encourages people to make a little yellow duck , such as this knitted one ( pictured ) and leave them for strangers one creative ' duck ' was even crafted out of an orange and some cardboard as part of the @entity31 he said : ' i picked it up and looked at the duck and thought ' oh that 's a really nice thing to do			1
i hope people carry it on and spread the goodwill			1
' @entity127 said he bought five lottery tickets with the surprise windfall and left them with the duck at a secret spot for someone else to find			0
the charity is also asking volunteers to knit or craft ducks out of whatever materials they can get their hands on and attach labels supporting the project			2
@entity23 said : ' the idea was for people to hand craft little yellow ducks and leave them in public places			1
the finder can then register where they found their duck on the project 's website and get information on organ donation			2
' i wish i could tell @entity25 that her collection and brave example have gone global			1
i know she 'd be chuffed			0
' many of the ducks have been found with differing amounts of money and a message attached to it which read : ' i 'm a duck and i have a present for you			1
