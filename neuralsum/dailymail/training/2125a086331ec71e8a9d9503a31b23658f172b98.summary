the daughter of @entity2 's embattled leader has risked fuelling anger among pro-democracy protesters after apparently mocking taxpayers on @entity6			1
@entity7 , whose father @entity8 is facing calls to quit by the end of today , reportedly attacked commenters who criticised a necklace she was wearing in her profile picture			1
in a string of inflammatory remarks on her purported @entity6 page , she sarcastically thanks her detractors by pointing out that the necklace and her other expensive clothes were paid for by public funds through her father 's salary			1
the post goes on to berate their level of intelligence , adding : ' most of you here are probably unemployed ... it 's okay - your mother still loves you			2
' the page has since been taken down and @entity7 has been unavailable for comment to verify the authenticity of the account			1
however , a number of respected @entity2 newspapers including the @entity37 and the @entity38 have previously reported that the page was hers			1
' actually considering the standard of @entity69 i 've skimmed through at times i doubt you 'd even understand what the term " social media platform " means ... it 's okay - your mother still loves you			2

' the week - long street protests by thousands of demonstrators pressing for freer elections in @entity2 are the biggest challenge to @entity108 's authority since @entity76 took control of the former @entity111 colony in 1997			1
they oppose the @entity76 government 's decision in august that all candidates in an inaugural 2017 election for the territory 's top post must be approved by a committee of mostly pro-beijing local elites			2
they say @entity76 is reneging on its promise that the chief executive would be chosen through ' universal suffrage			0
' student leaders who have played a key role in organising the protests initially wanted to meet with @entity8 , but after sunday 's clashes with police , they have stepped up calls for his resignation and asked that the central government in @entity108 heed their demands for genuine democratic reforms			2
raising the stakes of the stand - off , student leaders demanded wednesday that @entity8 resign by midnight thursday			0
supporters of @entity2 's democracy protesters turned on their cellphones while gathered at a downtown park in @entity142 in a show of support for the thousands of people in @entity2 who have taken to the streets to protest the @entity76 government 's decision not to allow open nominations for a new leader if he does n't , they said they would step up their actions , including occupying government buildings			1

we are demanding he resign , ' said may @entity179 , a 21 - year - old student at @entity180 , referring to @entity8			0
' it 's too late for his government to be accountable to the people so we want a new one			0
' one protester disagreed with the student leaders ' threat to occupy government buildings			0
' getting into a confrontation with police does n't seem peaceful to me , ' said @entity192 , a 22 - year - old recent university graduate			0
' if they try to force themselves inside and confront police , i do n't see what kind of point that would make			0
it may make fewer people support the protests			0
' the @entity76 government appeared to be losing patience			0
a student protester rests next to a defaced cut - out of @entity2 's chief executive leung chun - ying at one of their protest sites around the government headquarters earlier this week an editorial solemnly read wednesday evening on state tv said all @entity2 residents should support authorities in their efforts to ' deploy police enforcement decisively ' and ' restore the social order in @entity2 as soon as possible			1
' in the commentary published thursday , the @entity84 said that the rule of law must be safeguarded ' in order to realize the healthy development of democracy and politics in @entity2			1
