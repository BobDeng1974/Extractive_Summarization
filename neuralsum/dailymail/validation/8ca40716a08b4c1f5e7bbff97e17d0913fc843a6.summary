they are common to all whales , helping them to propel themselves forward through the water			0
but this week , a cetacean with no flukes was spotted diving off the coast of @entity9			1
the migrating gray whale , whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear , was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters			1
diving sharply into the ocean , it corkscrewed its body so that it could use the side of its peduncle - the area between its main body and where its flukes would be - to generate sufficient thrust			1
although experts believe the style of swimming could cause the whale to develop back problems , it is probably the only way it could make the migration			1
the flukeless creature , dubbed the ' whale without a tail ' by some whale watchers , was first spotted swimming alone off the coast of @entity57 in @entity58 on saturday , according to @entity59			1
a day later , it was seen diving into the ocean beyond @entity63 in @entity9 by stunned passengers aboard the @entity65 , who recognized it only when it blew a plume of mist into the air			2
and on monday , the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off @entity74 in @entity75 , accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration			2
speaking to the tv station , captain @entity79 of the @entity65 , which runs from @entity80 , said the rare sighting of the whale proves how intelligent the creatures are			0
' it just goes to show how smart these mammals are , to be able to adapt so well without a limb , ' he said			0
' it was migrating along fine , although a little slower than what we usually see			0
chopped off : the migrating gray whale ( pictured ) , whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear , was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters diving sharply into the ocean , it corkscrewed its body so that it could use the side of its peduncle - the area between its main body and where its flukes would be - to generate thrust			1
above , the whale 's amputated tail sighting : the flukeless creature was first spotted swimming alone off the coast of @entity57 in @entity58 on saturday			1
a day later , it was seen diving into the ocean beyond @entity63 ( pictured ) in @entity9 ' and during its deeper dives it would use its pectoral fins and swim harder on one side to spin around ” in kind of a corkscrew manner			2
but it did not seem to be in any trouble			0
' the whale , which will average 40 to 50 feet in length when fully grown , likely lost its fluke recently after becoming entangled in fishing gear , such as ropes from crab or lobster traps or gill nets			1
the entanglement could have cut off blood supply to the animal 's tail , reported captain @entity136 ’s @entity135 , which ran the boat trips during which the striking creature was seen			2
this may have led to the whale 's flukes dying and falling off without harming the rest of its body			1
@entity145 : captain @entity79 of the @entity65 whale watching boat , which runs from @entity80 , said the rare sighting of the whale ( pictured swimming ) proves how intelligent the creatures are another appearance : on monday , the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off @entity74 ( above ) in @entity75 , accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration speaking to @entity161 , marine biologist @entity158 , @entity159 , of @entity160 , said chronic entanglement trauma could be ' the worst form of animal welfare abuse '			1
he said it was likely that a gill net had slowly cut off the whale 's flukes , ' giving the major blood vessels that feed the fluke time to clot and heal as the damage got deeper			2
' according to captain @entity173 , researchers estimate that entanglement in fishing gear and other items kills nearly 1,000 dolphins and whales across the world on a daily basis			1
every year , gray whales make a 10,000 - to 14,000 - mile round trip from their feeding grounds in the cold @entity185 and @entity186 to @entity189 's @entity188 peninsula and the southern @entity190			2

above , a file photo of the @entity65 there , they mate and have calves in the regions ' warm lagoons			0
the migration is believed to be the longest annual migration of any mammal			0
@entity205 whales typically live between 55 and 70 years			0
it is not the first time a whale has been sighted with no flakes following an entanglement			0
in the 1990s , a flukeless gray whale was seen a number of times over nine years off the @entity188			0
two others were seen in 2011 and 2012 - one in the same location and another near @entity216 .			0

whale with no flukes was seen off coast of @entity9 this week
@entity222 was likely chopped off after animal became entangled in fishing gear
@entity226 , which was migrating to warm waters , used a new swimming style
dived sharply and corkscrewed body so it could use peduncle for thrust
mammal 's *incredible* *adaptability* is said to ' prove how smart ' whales are
nearly 1,000 whales and dolphins every day die following entanglement
