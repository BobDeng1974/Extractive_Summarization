the appointment of an arch - federalist as the @entity3 president risks creating a ‘ dramatic ’ backlash that will hasten @entity6 ’s exit from the @entity7 , one of the country ’s most senior diplomats has warned			1
a leaked document said @entity12 , the @entity6 ’s permanent representative to the @entity7 , believes the ‘ die is cast ’ in favour of @entity15 , the former prime minister of @entity16			2
his proposed elevation to @entity19 ’s top job has been fiercely opposed by @entity20 , who says @entity6 rejects the founding @entity7 principle of ‘ ever closer union ’ , which mr @entity15 supports			1
former @entity16 prime minister @entity15 , pictured , seems almost certain to be appointed president of the @entity3 but during a dinner with @entity26 , the head of the @entity27 , mr @entity12 apparently warned that ‘ short of a complete u-turn ’ by @entity31 leader @entity30 , mr @entity15 is on course to be appointed			1
he said @entity19 was ‘ sleepwalking into an institutional crisis ’ and apparently suggested a referendum on @entity6 ’s membership of the @entity7 , which mr @entity20 has promised by 2017 if he remains in power , could be brought forward			2
‘ he warned that mr @entity15 ’s appointment could accelerate a @entity6 referendum on leaving the @entity7 and will completely change the political landscape ’ , a diplomatic source was quoted as saying			1
‘ @entity12 warned that the appointment could lead to dramatic events in july and that it should be a priority for the @entity7 to avoid such a train crash			0
’ @entity20 , left , has failed to convince @entity31 chancellor @entity30 , right , to block mr @entity15 's appointment to the top @entity7 post @entity6 officials fear mrs @entity30 may try and use a summit next week in @entity46 to rush through mr @entity15 ’s appointment , amid worries that relations between @entity6 and @entity31 will sour further if the row goes on for months			1
@entity50 , the @entity51 prime minister who has been an ally of mr @entity20 in opposing mr @entity15 , suggested he was preparing to accept defeat			1
‘ i can imagine @entity15 will get it , though we ’re not there yet , ’ he said			0
mr @entity12 was said to have used the dinner in @entity46 last tuesday to warn that ‘ allowing the @entity57 rather than national governments to appoint the commission president is unacceptable and takes the @entity7 to a different place ’			0
the @entity6 ‘ would not accept the outcome of the process ’ , he said , since it would be political ‘ dynamite ’ that could push the @entity6 towards the exit door			0
a @entity6 diplomat said the account of the dinner , also attended by officials representing other @entity7 countries , was ‘ exaggerated ’			0
‘ @entity12 was very clear about our views but some of it has got lost in translation , ’ the source said			0
‘ the planned timing of a @entity6 referendum has not changed			0
the appointment of @entity15 might change the dynamic of the referendum but not the timing			2

@entity15 seen as front - *runner* despite serious @entity6 concerns
@entity31 chancellor @entity30 set to back the former @entity16 *pm*
@entity20 *strongly* opposes mr @entity15 's appointment as president
