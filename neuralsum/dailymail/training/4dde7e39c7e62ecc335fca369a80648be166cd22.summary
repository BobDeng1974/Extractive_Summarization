the @entity1 used a @entity3 spy base to listen in on the phone calls of @entity5 and 35 other world leaders , it was claimed last night			1
@entity7 in @entity8 , which is run by @entity1 ’s @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , is the biggest surveillance and interception facility in @entity12			1
the base analyses satellite signals as well as mobile phone and electronic data from private individuals , governments and corporations			0
concern : @entity7 in @entity8 has now been dragged inot the intelligence scandal last week it was reported that @entity1 spies had been listening in on the phone conversations of dozens of world leaders			1
claim : @entity9 whistleblower @entity26 implicated the @entity3 base the allegations led mrs @entity5 to call @entity29 and ask him to account for his agents ’ actions			1
now fresh claims by @entity1 whistleblower @entity33 , who worked for the @entity9 for 30 years , have dragged @entity3 into the scandal			1
mr @entity26 believes @entity1 agents used the base to intercept the @entity39 leader ’s phone calls – with the full knowledge of @entity3 officials			1
he told @entity42 it was likely agents at @entity7 ‘ either directly collected the data or would have processed data ’ from the bugged calls before sending the information back to @entity49			0
mr @entity26 , who left the @entity9 in 2001 over fears it was illegally gathering ‘ huge swathes ’ of electronic data from citizens in the @entity1 and globally , said : ‘ if the information did n’t come from there , it is almost a certainty that it would have been processed there			1
’ he added : ‘ everything goes through there to be analysed before the information is sent back to @entity49			0
’ @entity7 , which has 33 distinctive golf ball - shaped ‘ radomes ’ to house satellite dishes , was effectively handed over to the @entity1 in the 1950s in recognition of the important intelligence - sharing relationship between the two countries			2
the base works closely with @entity3 ’s own top - secret listening station , @entity71 in @entity72			1
committee : former @entity74 leader sir @entity74 said there needed to be a ' robust and easily understood legal system of control ' any information processed or analysed at @entity7 is then sent back to @entity9 headquarters in @entity80 , @entity49			2
the @entity81 insists ministers are ‘ fully briefed on the activities at @entity7 ’			0
but concerns have long been expressed about the lack of scrutiny @entity1 spying operations face when they are carried out on @entity3 soil			2
responding to calls for greater transparency , the @entity92 ’ @entity91 – whose members are among a select group of @entity3 politicians with security clearance to visit the site – has promised to review the laws that keep a check on intelligence - gathering by @entity3			0
former @entity74 leader sir @entity74 , one of the mps who sits on the committee , said there needed to be a ‘ robust and easily understood legal system of control ’			0
listening in : last week it was reported that the @entity1 had listened in on world leaders including @entity5 ( pictured ) he told @entity42 that the current system of regulation was set up before some of the ‘ far - reaching capabilities of intelligence - gathering ’ were in existence			2
sir @entity74 said : ‘ @entity117 must therefore be ready to review whether the existing legislation is good enough			0
when it comes to relations with other countries there is a well - established relationship between the five eyes – the @entity3 , @entity1 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			2
‘ of these relationships , the one between the @entity3 and the @entity1 is by far the strongest			0
but no matter the strength of any relationship , the responsibility for legality and for review must always rest with domestic government			0
’ documents leaked by @entity9 whistleblower @entity137 in june revealed how spies based at @entity7 managed to intercept @entity140 ’s calls as the former @entity142 president visited @entity3 for the @entity144 summit in 2009			1
but mr @entity26 ’s claim suggests that the base is used to intercept calls from politicians all over @entity12 , not just those who are visiting the @entity3			1
the @entity81 said : ‘ we do not comment on intelligence matters			0

@entity7 , run by @entity9 , is the biggest surveillance facility in @entity12
