by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 15 june 2013 @entity2 's top leader furiously told @entity3 ' the hell with you ' following @entity7 criticism over the openness of the @entity10 's presidential contest			1
@entity11 , the supreme leader of iran , issued the stinging rebuke after casting his ballot in a race widely criticised in the @entity16 as being rigged in favour of @entity19 's ruling system			1
the vote will bring an end to the eight - year era of the combative president @entity23 , whose 2009 re-election was steeped in controversy			0
many critics said it was the result of systematic fraud in vote counting after the reformist @entity30 was brutally crushed angry : @entity2 supreme leader @entity11 blasted the @entity7 for its criticism of today 's presidential election as he cast his ballot today the election race has taken unexpected turns in the past days as reform - minded @entity2 surge behind the only moderate of the six candidates			1
a victory by former nuclear negotiator @entity38 would be seen as a small setback for @entity2 's @entity41 establishment			2
candidates seen as hard - line loyalists include current nuclear negotiator @entity44 and @entity11 adviser @entity46			1
recent comments by @entity11 were interpreted as support for @entity44 , whose reputation is further enhanced by a battlefield injury during the 1980 - 88 war with then @entity7 - backed @entity52 that cost him the lower part of his right leg			1
@entity11 , however , has not publicly endorsed a successor for @entity23 , who had a spectacular falling out with the theocracy over his attempts to challenge @entity11 's near - absolute powers			1
the @entity11 did not reveal who he was voting for when he cast his ballot today			1
voting : presidential candidate @entity44 , centre , casts his ballot during the @entity2 presidential election today but he used the occasion to issue his stinging criticism to the @entity7 for its repeated criticism of @entity2 's clampdowns on the opposition and the rejection of @entity68 and other moderate voices from the ballot			1
' recently i have heard that a @entity7 security official has said they do not accept this election , ' @entity11 was quoted by state tv after casting his vote			1
' ok , the hell with you			0
' in @entity3 on yesterday , @entity80 spokesman @entity79 said that while the @entity7 does not think the @entity2 election process is transparent , it is not discouraging the @entity2 people from voting			1
' we certainly encourage them to , ' @entity79 said			0
' but certainly the history here and what happened just four years ago gives all of us pause			0
' moderate : presidential candidate @entity38 shows his identification before casting his vote after voting , @entity68 said he hoped the election would lead to ' national unity , a requirement for success against any domestic and foreign risks			1
' if no candidate wins an outright majority , a runoff pitting the two top finishers would take place june 21 , so even a strong showing by @entity38 in today 's voting could be overturned			2
@entity38 's backers , such as former president @entity68 - who was blocked from running by @entity2 's ruling system - have urged reformists and others to cast ballots and abandon plans to boycott the election in protest over years of arrests and pressure			1
@entity2 's security networks now appear to have blanket control , ranging from swift crackdowns on any public dissent to cybercops blocking opposition internet websites and social media			2
yet other cracks are evident			0
combative : today 's vote brings an end to the eight - year era of president @entity23 @entity129 sanctions over @entity2 's nuclear program have pummeled the economy by shrinking vital oil sales and leaving the country isolated from international banking systems			2
new @entity7 measures taking effect july 1 further target the country 's currency , the rial , which has lost half its foreign exchange value in the past year , driving prices of food and consumer goods sharply higher			1
such concerns could have a direct effect on the outcome of the election			2
@entity19 's mayor , @entity148 , is widely viewed as a capable fiscal manager and could draw in votes , since economic affairs are among the direct responsibilities of @entity2 's president			1
other key issues , such as the nuclear program , defense and foreign relations , are all fully controlled by the @entity11 , his inner circle and its protectors , led by the powerful @entity160			2
the other candidates permitted on the ballot by election overseers are seen as hard - line loyalists , including current nuclear negotiator @entity44 and @entity11 adviser @entity46			1
such insiders in the presidency would give @entity2 's leadership a seamless front with significant challenges ahead , such as the possible resumption of nuclear talks with the @entity7 and other world powers and the increasing showdown in @entity175 between rebels and the @entity2 - backed regime of @entity178			1
yesterday , the @entity179 said it would begin sending arms to @entity175 rebel fighters after intelligence officials concluded @entity178 's forces used chemical weapons			0
but there also are clear chances that the election could leave @entity2 further divided			0
@entity38 's rapid rise from longshot to reformist hopeful - aided by endorsements from artists and activists - has shown the resilience of @entity2 's opposition despite relentless crackdowns			0
a defeat could leave them even more embittered and alienated			0
at final rallies , @entity38 's supporters waved his campaign 's signature purple - a clear nod to the single - color identity of the now - crushed @entity30 and its leader , @entity204 , who has been under house arrest for more than two years			0
important : an @entity2 woman casts her vote in the first round of the presidential election at a polling station in @entity19 today on wednesday , the last day of campaigning , thousands of supporters welcomed @entity38 in the northeastern city of @entity215 yelling : ' long live reforms			1
' some @entity38 backers also have used the campaign events to chant for the release of @entity204 and other political prisoners , including former parliament speaker @entity221 , leading to some arrests and scuffles with police			0
@entity38 is far from a radical outsider , though			0
he led the influential @entity226 and was given the highly sensitive nuclear envoy role in 2003 , a year after @entity2 's 20 - year - old atomic program was revealed			0
but he is believed to favor a less confrontational approach with the @entity16 and would give a forum for now - sidelined officials such as @entity68 and former president @entity232 , whose reformist terms from 1997 - 2005 opened unprecedented social and political freedoms that have since been largely rolled back			0
helping out : an @entity2 boy places his mother 's voting slip in a ballot box at a polling station it was unclear how much the boycott calls by reformists could cut into the turnout among @entity2 's estimated 50 million voters , which was reported at 85 percent four years ago			2
in @entity19 , lines were seen at various polling stations			2
@entity247 also showed video of voting queues in various cities			0
journalists were under wide - ranging restrictions limiting movement around the country			0
@entity2 does not permit outside election observers			0
@entity256 , a close adviser to @entity11 , predicted there would be no need for a runoff round next friday			2
but @entity2 's interior minister , @entity260 , dismissed ' any speculation before ending the vote counting ' by his office			0
outside @entity2 , votes were casts by the country 's huge diaspora including @entity268 , @entity269 and points across the @entity7 .			1
