they may have intelligent sales techniques and an ability to make viewers splash the cash on items they do not necessarily need - but astronomy is clearly not these @entity9 presenters ' strong point			1
this hilarious video shows the moment two presenters on the shopping channel go from selling a cardigan to discussing whether the @entity14 is a star or a planet			1
as on of the presenters , @entity17 , displays the garish outfit , she says it looks like @entity21 as viewed from beyond ' @entity22 '			2
@entity23 : a model ( right ) on the @entity9 cringes as the two hosts discuss whether the moon is a planet or a star in the clip from @entity9 earlier this week , ms @entity17 says the cardigan ' kind of looks like what the @entity21 looks like when you 're a bazillion miles away from the planet moon '			1
co-host designer @entity35 replies : ' @entity36 ... ' after hearing it out loud for herself , ms @entity17 appears to realise she has made a mistake in turning the conversation from fashion to science			0
she backtracks with : ' is n't the @entity14 a star ? ' ' @entity14 is a planet , darling , ' mr @entity35 incorrectly tells her			1
the show descends into a bizarre argument as the hosts try to work out what the @entity21 's only natural satellite - and the @entity50 are			1
forgetting they are meant to be selling the cardigans , the presenters continue their argument , asking viewers to @entity56 what the @entity14 is ms @entity17 says : ' is the @entity14 really a planet ? do n’t look at me like that			1
the @entity50 is a star ... is the @entity50 not a star ? ' mr @entity35 replies : ' i do n’t know what the @entity50 is			0
' viewers are then asked to @entity56 the answer to help the confused co-hosts , who seem to have lost all interest in selling clothes			1
' so what else is it ? ' mr @entity35 asks			0
ms @entity17 replies : ' i believe it 's a star ... or something			2
' she adds : ' i feel like sometimes , though i am educated , i expose in this show that this blonde could be real			0
' viewers of the video on @entity78 were amazed at the ' shameful display of scientific illiteracy '			0
one user , called @entity82 , wrote : ' this should serve as inspiration			0
the man who believes the @entity14 is a planet " that things live on " is a millionaire who was a household name in the 90s for his eponymous fashion line			2
if he can do it , we all can			0
' user paddles409 added : ' the moon is a hollow , artificial satellite inhabited by giant , superior , hyperintelligent , ants			0
hail ants ! ' the @entity14 is neither a star or a planet , it is @entity21 's only natural satellite			1
thought to have formed 4.5 billion years ago , scientists believe it is made from debris left from an impact between @entity21 and a large planet			2
it orbits our planet around once every four weeks , with one side of the @entity14 always facing @entity21			1
despite being more than 238,000 miles away , @entity21 's tides are mostly generated by the @entity14 's gravitational pull			1
the first human to walk on the moon was @entity114 in 1969 , with a total of 12 astronauts setting foot on the satellite			0
no one has visited the @entity14 since 1972			0
other planets in the solar system have moons , but @entity21 is the only one with a singular satellite .			2

video shows @entity9 presenters arguing over *composition* of the @entity14
host gets *sidetracked* *speculating* whether the @entity14 is a planet or a star
puzzled co-hosts asked viewers for the answer as they did n't know
the @entity14 is the @entity21 's only natural satellite - not a star or planet
