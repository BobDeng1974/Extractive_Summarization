by 2020 , our day - to - day lives , relationships and even what to have for dinner could be controlled and run by digital versions of ourselves			1
according to futurist @entity6 , within the next six years many of us could have so - called ‘ digital twins ’ that schedule our appointments and even have conversations with others on our behalf			1
and they could one day console loved ones after we die by mimicking our voice , emotions , mannerisms and thoughts			1
they could even console loved ones after we die by mimicking our voice , emotions , mannerisms and thoughts mr @entity6 , founder of the @entity29 , made the comments during an interview with @entity32			1
‘ [ @entity34 twins ] will become increasingly like us and extensions of us , ’ @entity6 said			1
@entity36 , director of engineering at @entity37 , believes that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			1
mr @entity36 also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			2
the claims made by @entity6 regarding ' digital twins ' are a step towards this futurist theory of singularity becoming a reality			1
technological singularity is the development of ' superintelligence ' brought about through the use of technology			2
the first use of ' singularity ' in terms of technological minds was by mathematician @entity62 in the mid- 1950s			2
he said : ' ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life , which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs , as we know them , could not continue			1
' the term was then used by science fiction writer @entity76 who believes brain - computer interfaces are causes of the singularity			1
@entity36 cited @entity62 's use of the term in a foreword to @entity62 's classic @entity83			0
@entity36 predicts the singularity to occur around 2045 while @entity76 predicts it will happen before 2030			0
‘ when you and i die , our kids are n’t going to go to our tombstones , they ’re going to fire up our digital twins and talk to them			1
’ he continued there are prediction apps and software that already carry out similar tasks – such as @entity96 and @entity97 – and these services are only going to get smarter as algorithms , interfaces and processing power increases			1
the software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction			0
in the case of personal - assistant apps , the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is , or should be			2
it combines this with location data , taken from the phone or tablet ’s gps unit , as well as posts on social networks , email information and more			0
it then presents the user with the help it thinks they need			0
for example , if a calendar on an @entity129 phone contains a diary invite , @entity97 will create a reminder			2
it will then check to see whether the user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder , or work out how long it will take them to get there based on current traffic			0
elsewhere , as users pass bus stops , prediction apps can show bus timetables , show the latest deals as they enter a supermarket , or open a digital boarding pass as they approach an airport			2
mr @entity6 believes that digital twins could additionally learn our likes and dislikes from emails , messages and verbal feedback , in the way that machine learning currently does			1
@entity160 ’s @entity159 supercomputer uses machine learning , as does ‘ @entity161 ’ - a computer program that was able to trick users it was a teenage boy , leading to claims it had passed the turing test			1
@entity159 won the tv game show @entity170 , in 2011 , by answering general knowledge questions posed in natural language			0
more recently it has been used as a customer call centre agent and can learn a customer 's needs			0
mr @entity6 continued there are prediction apps and personal assistant software that already carry out similar tasks – such as @entity96 and @entity97 ( pictured ) – and these services are only going to get smarter as algorithms , interfaces and processing power increases the @entity185 was introduced by @entity187 codebreaker @entity186 in 1950 as part of his paper @entity189 in which he predicted that computers would one day be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence			1
@entity193 's @entity96 ( pictured ) already uses context to answer questions , and digital twins could take this a step further to learn about how a person thinks he proposed a test called @entity201 , which would identify whether a computer is capable of thought			1
a person , called the interrogator , engages in a text based conversation with another person and a computer - and must determine which is which			0
if they are unable to do so the computer is deemed to have passed - as was the case with @entity213			0
and as firms such as @entity37 buy artificial intelligence firms , such as @entity217 , it makes the technology more mainstream			0
@entity37 ’s acquisition of @entity220 in june was n’t the tech giant ’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning			0
its @entity226 search update was created to make @entity37 ' more human ' , and searches can now understand context , like a human brain			0
@entity37 also hired futurist @entity36 as engineering director in 2012			0
@entity36 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			2
he also believes the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			0
the claims made by @entity6 are a step towards this futurist theory of singularity becoming a reality			1
@entity246 from @entity247 told @entity248 : ' we can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in existing @entity37 products like @entity97 , the search function that forms part of @entity255 and @entity37 ’s self - driving car project			2
' a string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence , along with the recent hiring of @entity36 as a director of engineering shows that @entity37 is by no means done with machine learning : it is clear that the company is just getting started			0
mr @entity6 believes digital twins could learn our likes and dislikes from emails , messages and verbal feedback , in the way that machine learning currently does , such as ‘ @entity161 ’ - a computer program that was able to trick users it was a teenage boy , leading to claims it had passed the turing test ( pictured ) @entity280 believes that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			1
this chart plots the exponential growth of computing			0
@entity36 , director of engineering at @entity37 , claims singularity will become reality as soon as 2045 mr @entity6 ( picutred ) is a futurist and founder of the @entity29 ‘ taking into account the present scale of @entity37 ’s computer network , the size of its user base and its capital reserves , @entity37 is well placed to take on something as ambitious as machine consciousness			1
’ machine consciousness differs from machine intelligence			0
there are already intelligent machines that can learn from their mistakes and fix errors , but many of these are programmed to do so			0
for example , world chess grandmaster , @entity310 , was defeated by @entity160 ’s ‘ @entity313 ’ supercomputer in 1997			2
‘ to make wise decisions in the present , we must strive to deeply understand where we are in relation to both the known past and our probable futures , ’ explained mr @entity6			1
‘ this will require the support of global communities , which make the disciplined development of the field of foresight their top priority			0
‘ in particular , one of my long - term professional goals is to find passionate financial sponsors interested in the development of more world - leading academic programs in technology foresight , acceleration studies , and evolutionary development studies			2

the claims were made by futurist and *system* theorist @entity6
he believes we will have ‘ digital twins ’ within the next five years
these twins could act like digital personal *secretaries* or agents
they could also , one day , have human faces and hold conversations
in addition , when *people* die , loved ones could converse with digital versions of ourselves long after our death
apps already exist that offer similar tools *including* @entity96 and @entity97
the claims signal a step towards the futurist theory of singularity
