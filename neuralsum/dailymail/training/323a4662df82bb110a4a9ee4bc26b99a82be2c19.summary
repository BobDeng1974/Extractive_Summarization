more than three decades later the victims and their survivors have yet to receive compensation , prohibited to bring a case against @entity5 due to the terms of the release agreement from 1981			1
survivor : @entity23 cut his wrists during his 444 days held hostage , in the hope that he would be so badly hurt that he would be released from solitary confinement captive : one of the 52 @entity2 hostages is displayed to the crowd outside the @entity31 in @entity13 by his captors , a few days into their ordeal however , they are hoping to end their 33 - year - long battle for justice by persuading @entity37 to aid them in their quest for a court judgment against @entity5 as a state sponsor of terrorism			1
@entity23 , 61 , was the assistant general services officer at the @entity31 in 1979			2

‘ i wanted to hurt myself bad enough that they would panic , ’ he told the @entity50			0
he was found covered in blood and says he was ‘ ready to die , ’ but the militants managed to get him to a hospital in time			0
now he suffers from recurring nightmares that the deal has been rescinded and he will have to go back to his captors			2
' it ’s never completely in the past , ’ he says			0
‘ you ’re always in the shadow of it psychologically			0
’ scarred for life : @entity62 was only 22 when he was taken hostage in november 1979 and says @entity5 ' raped ' him of his freedom blame : @entity65 , daughter of a hostage says the 444 days as a hostage changed her father and is the reason why she has not seen him for eight years paraded : the blindfolded and bound man from the 52 held hostage is taken outside the embassy by the young militia in the early days of the hostage - taking held : a photograph from november 1979 shows two @entity5 militants with a female hostage at the @entity2 embassy ‘ @entity5 raped us of our freedom , ’ says @entity62 , who , aged 22 , was the youngest hostage taken			1
mr @entity62 spent the first month in captivity sleeping with his hands tied to his feet , and describes how the hostages were forced to watch torture videos of people being dipped in boiling tar or shot in the head in front of the camera			2
to this day he still suffers from flashbacks , has trouble being alone and say he will never forget his time in captivity			0
the @entity5 hostage crisis began on november 4 , 1979 when young militants calling themselves @entity100 , supporters of the @entity97 , stormed the @entity31 in @entity13			1
the storming of the embassy was a result of mounting hostility against the @entity2 after the exiled @entity105 of @entity5 was allowed to enter the @entity2 for cancer treatment @entity107 , was installed and supported by both the @entity2 and the @entity108 governments but his rule was overthrown shortly after his exile in january 1979 and replaced with an @entity113 republic			1
in april 1980 there was a failed attempt to rescue the hostages which resulted in the deaths of eight @entity2 servicemen , one @entity5 civilian , and the destruction of two aircraft			2
the release of the hostages was prompted by the invasion of @entity5 by @entity125 , then leader of @entity126 , in combination with the death om the exiled @entity105			1
the @entity129 was signed on january 20 , 1981 by president @entity130 , just minutes after he was sworn into office			1
all hostages were released the following day after one year , two months , two weeks and two days in captivity			2
army colonel @entity134 who died in 1990 , would tell his children of being beaten with rubber hoses and telephone books			0
@entity139 in the years following his release , his family found him kneeling against a wall in the basement with his hands over his head as if he was handcuffed			2
former hostage @entity145 , 76 , says he was under constant threat during his time as a hostage			2
he recalls how the group would be awoken in the middle of the night , stripped and blindfolded for mock - executions			0
his daughter , @entity65 wrote a letter to @entity154 during her father ’s capture begging for his release			2

‘ it is very difficult for me not having my dad around			0
’ when her father finally returned , he was a changed man			0
ms @entity65 recalls watching her parents marriage fall apart , after which mr @entity145 moved away			0
he missed her college graduation as well as both her and her brother ’s weddings			0
she has not seen her father for eight years			0
over the years the 52 hostages , 12 of which have passed since they were freed , have tried and failed to get justice and relief in @entity2 courts multiple times			1
this is due to the 1981 @entity129 , a deal brokered between the @entity2 and @entity5 by @entity178 , which saw the hostages released			1
president @entity180 signed the agreement which included a clause prohibiting the 52 hostages from bringing a lawsuit against @entity5 in a @entity2 court			1
the hostages and their families did bring a case against @entity5 in 2000 and won a default liability ruling after the state of @entity5 failed to mount a defense			1
however , the @entity191 argued to dismiss the case as it would violate an agreement signed by a @entity2 president			0
compensation and justice : @entity197 is estimating that each hostage should be awarded nearly $ 18million for their ordeal arguing that the @entity8 has never specifically invalidated the @entity129 , district judge @entity201 ruled to dismiss the case in 2002			1
in his ruling he wrote : ‘ were this court empowered to judge by its sense of justice , the heart - breaking accounts of the emotional and physical toll of those 444 days on plaintiffs would be more than sufficient justification for granting all the relief that they request			1
’ ‘ however , this court is bound to apply the law that @entity8 has created , according to the rules of interpretation that the @entity211 has determined			2
there are two branches of government that are empowered to abrogate and rescind the @entity129 , and the judiciary is not one of them			0
’ judge @entity201 dismissed a second case in 2010 for the same reason , which was later rejected by the @entity211			0
in the forthcoming weeks the hostages and their families will put forward a dossier of information to the @entity8 , containing interviews with survivors and families about their 444 - day long ordeal			1
former hostage @entity197 estimates that each hostage is owed $ 18million in compensation , but says he does not expect to get anywhere near that .			0
