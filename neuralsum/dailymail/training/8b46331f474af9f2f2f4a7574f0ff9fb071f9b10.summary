by @entity0 the chances of a ewe giving birth to five lambs is a million to one but brothers @entity5 and @entity7 have beaten the odds for the second year in a row			1
a ewe at their farm in @entity13 in the @entity14 gave birth to the rare set of quintuplets last week and both mother and babies are doing well			1
@entity7 , 41 , who helped make the special delivery , said he was stunned to see five lambs pop out - especially after another of their ewes gave birth to quintuplets during the lambing season last year			1
against the odds : this ewe at a farm in the @entity14 had five normal - sized healthy offspring - a million - to - one chance gim me five : now fit , strong and healthy , these quintuplets , pictured with their mother , are enjoying life in the @entity14 and despite the unusual pregnancy he said the labour was one of the easiest there has been at the farm this year			1
' despite the ewe giving birth to five lambs , it was a straightforward labour , ' he said			2
' the lambs came out of the mother one straight after the other without any difficulty			2
there were also no health problems with any of the lambs and , despite being quintuplets , they are all regular size			0
' you rarely see a ewe giving birth to quadruplets , so to have it happen second year running is a complete surprise			2
' last year , @entity7 and @entity5 , 46 allowed all five lambs to stay with their mother , a cross @entity63 breed , for two days before the brothers gave two of them to other ewes , to give the lambs a better chance of growing up stronger			1
simple : the birth was surprisingly straightforward , according to the farmer			2
pictured with the five lambs are ( left to right ) @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 huddled together in the arms of a farmer , the five brothers and sisters ar pictured before two of them were given to another ewe to improve their chance of growing up stronger ' they were kept together for a couple of days but it would n't be fair on the ewe or the five lambs to be all kept together , ' said @entity7			0
' it would put too much pressure on the ewe and the lambs would not get the milk they required			0
' to relieve stress on the mother , two of the five lambs were given to other ewes and it has worked great for all of them			0
' the brothers , who began their lambing season on april 13 , have so far seen 680 ewes give birth , with just another 40 to go			0
as well as attending to expectant ewes , @entity7 and @entity5 are also in the process of calving			0
after spending several days inside the barn , all five lambs have now been put out to graze			0
bounding along in the green fields of the @entity14 behind their proud mother , the lambs have all now been put out to pasture .			1
