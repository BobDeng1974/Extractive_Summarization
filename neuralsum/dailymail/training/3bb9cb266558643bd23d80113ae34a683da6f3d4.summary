@entity0 is planning an audacious mission to catch an asteroid in a giant , draw - string bag and tow it to the @entity5 - close enough for human explorers to visit			1
the @entity8 space agency is set to ask @entity9 for $ 100million in its next budget request to start planning the project , which could be the next target for human spaceflight			1
the mission , first suggested last year by space experts at the @entity15 , would aim to pluck a 500 - ton asteroid from its orbit using an unmanned spacecraft , then haul it into orbit near the @entity5			1
how to catch an asteroid : this graphic shows how the projected asteroid - catching spacecraft might look			1
the 18 - ton probe would catch a 500 - ton space rock in a giant , draw - string bag projected to cost $ 2.65billion in total and last ten years , the project is said to have found favour with president @entity32 's administration , which has already announced a goal of sending astronauts to a near - @entity36 asteroid by 2025			1
researchers from @entity15 's @entity38 ( @entity38 ) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring , but rumours of @entity0 's decision to ask for funding for the project were reported by @entity45 last week			1
' the idea of exploiting the natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years , but only now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality , ' the report says			0
the @entity38 feasibility study suggests that bringing a 500 - ton asteroid closer to @entity36 would give astronaut crews a ' unique , meaningful and affordable ' destination for the next decade			1
it adds : ' placing an @entity58 [ near @entity59 ] in lunar orbit would provide a new capability for human exploration not seen since @entity63			0
such an achievement has the potential to inspire a nation			0
' it would be mankind ’s first attempt at modifying the heavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space			1
' schematic : researchers from @entity15 's @entity38 ( @entity38 ) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring , but @entity0 is now reportedly seeking funding to execute it the report outlines an entirely robotic mission to locate and capture a @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , with a diameter of about seven metres and a mass of around 500,000kg			1
it is hoped such a modestly sized space rock may contain up to 100 tons of water , 100 tons of carbon rich compounds , 90 tons of metals and 200 tons of silicates			1
an 18 - ton probe would be launched on an @entity90 rocket and use the @entity5 's gravity to slingshot itself towards its target in interplanetary space			2
once there , the spacecraft would deploy a massive inflatable bag to envelop the asteroid - manoeuvring to stabilise against any tumble or rotation - then ' multiple " draw strings " would cinch - close the opening of the bag and also cinch - tight against the bulk material , ' the report says			2
it adds : ' due to the residual velocity between the asteroid and the spacecraft , there would be some “ impact ” as the asteroid is captured			2
' although , since the asteroid would be much more massive than the spacecraft , it is perhaps better to think of this as the asteroid capturing the spacecraft			2
' nevertheless , once the spacecraft and asteroid are tightly secured together , the spacecraft could then de-tumble the combination			2
' the proposed timeline for capturing the asteroid : projected to cost $ 2.65billion in total and last ten years , the project is said to have found favour with the @entity32 administration an ion thruster is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft that creates thrust by accelerating ions			1
ion thrusters use beams of ions ( electrically charged atoms or molecules ) to create thrust in accordance with momentum conservation			0
they create very small levels of thrust compared to conventional chemical rockets but achieve very high specific impulse , or propellant mass efficiencies , by accelerating their exhausts to very high speed			0
however , ion thrusters carry a fundamental price : the power imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of its velocity while the thrust increases only linearly			2
normal chemical rockets , on the other hand , can provide very high thrust but are limited in total impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in the propellants			0
due to their relatively high power needs and the requirement of an environment void of other ionized particles ion thrust propulsion is currently only practical in space			0
moving such a huge object using conventional rockets would need an enormous amount of fuel to be carried along with the probe			0
so rather than using chemical rockets it would be equipped with a solar powered electric propulsion system			0
such ' ion thrusters ' , as they are known , work by using electricity generated by solar panels to accelerate charged particles away from the space craft , ars technica explains			0
using these , the spacecraft could begin its long track back to the @entity5 , estimated to take between two and six years			0
the revelation that @entity0 wants money to begin planning a mission to capture an asteroid from interplanetary space comes three months after major - general @entity193 made a cryptic suggestion to a @entity196 committee on human space flight			1
' when the president announced that an asteroid would be the next destination for @entity0 's human spaceflight programme , he did not say @entity0 had to fly all the way to an asteroid , ' he said			0
' what matters is the ability to put humans on an asteroid			0
