mr @entity0 told the congregation of thousands at @entity9 in @entity10 on sunday that he did not approach police because @entity13 's victim , named @entity14 , did not want to prompt an investigation into the abuse			1
' you had a situation where this was the first time i had ever heard about my father 's abuses , ' mr @entity0 said to the huge crowd , according to @entity24			1
' there was a victim , a survivor , who was adamant he did not want a police investigation and he did n't want a church investigation			2
' so , i genuinely believed at the time , by the way no one gave me any advice to counter this , that if he wanted to go to police , he was 36 , he could , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' obviously if it was someone who was still a child we would have had no choice but to report it			0
it seems i was wrong and that will form part of the findings			0

' there have been reports of money being paid to the victim			0
again for clarification , this was between my father and the victim , ' he said to the following , ' it had nothing to do with me or @entity30			0
' ' you never forget the moment you find out your father is a paedophile ' : @entity0 said at the @entity81 into @entity82 to @entity83 in @entity84 last week mr @entity0 first heard the allegations levelled by @entity14 in late october 1999 during his weekly meeting with general manager @entity87			1

' it hit me in a ten second period , in a wave , ' he told the commission , ' you never forget ' the moment you find out your father is a paedophile			0

mr @entity0 then cried and went home			2
' i was devastated , to be honest with you , ' he said			0
' the witness @entity14 alleged to the hearing on tuesday that when he was 7 , that mr @entity0 's father @entity13 would come to his room , lie on him , fondle him and masturbate him last tuesday , @entity14 told the commission @entity13 would stay with his family when he came to @entity84 from @entity113 in the 1970s			1
@entity14 was seven when @entity13 would come to his room , lie on him , fondle him and masturbate him , the alleged victim told the commission			1
' i would wake up petrified and i would stay very still , ' @entity14 said			0
he said the abuse left him feeling ashamed , and he now suffered depression			0
mr @entity0 told the hearing that if @entity14 was under 18 - he was in his mid- 30s at the time of the complaint - then he was ' absolutely certain ' they would have gone to the police			1
' rightly or wrongly , i thought i would be preempting the victim if i were to have called the police at that point , ' mr @entity0 said			1

in reply to questions from counsel assisting the commission @entity159 , pastor @entity135 said he truthfully could not answer why the policy was not followed ' except to say that it was a new policy and not fully understood and the fact there was no formal complaint and the complainant did not give his name '			0
mr @entity159 : ' according to @entity0 ? ' when asked about @entity0 's conflict of interest and the executive 's dependence on him to investigate his father and take action pastor @entity135 : ' yes , we agree it was a difficult situation from that perspective ...
