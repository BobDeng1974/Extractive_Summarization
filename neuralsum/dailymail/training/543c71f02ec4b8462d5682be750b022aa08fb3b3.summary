@entity0 is developing its own in - house equivalent to @entity2 , the controversial photo messaging app that has been accused of promoting ' sexting ' among youngsters			1
@entity2 allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed			1
the messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures , with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online			2
onward march of the search giant : @entity0 is reportedly gearing up to release its own @entity2 - like service , despite fears the app could be promoting promiscuous behaviour among youngsters @entity2 's homepage : the messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures , with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online however , it has come under fire for promising more privacy than it can guarantee , since it remains possible to take a screengrab of the picture before it self destructs			1
@entity0 , the world 's most popular social network , reportedly plans to launch its own @entity2 - like service in the coming weeks , before the end of the year			1
the new app will be standalone and separate from the main @entity0 app , @entity34 reports , bringing the social network 's app count up to four including @entity39 - five if you count @entity41			2
@entity2 has risen to notoriety over the past year with many commentators accusing the service of promoting irresponsible sexual behaviour among teenagers			1
launched in september 2011 , it was reportedly inspired by the the humiliation of @entity50 politician @entity49 , who was caught sending explicit pictures of himself to a woman online			1
the service allows users to send pictures to a recipient , while stipulating a time limit during which they can view the images			1
this would allow a user to send a naked picture to another , but give the recipient , say , only five minutes in which to view it before it automatically erases itself			2
check this out : there are fears that @entity2 's claims at enhancing the security of picture messaging could encourage youngsters to send explicit pictures in the mistaken belief that they can not be captured and shared @entity0 could use location metadata to make money from @entity41 , the cult photosharing service it acquired for $ 715million in september			1
there have been rumours adverts would soon appear on @entity41 's thus far uncluttered user interface but a senior executive for the social network would recently only confirm plans to ' monetise @entity41 '			0
@entity0 's vice president of global marketing @entity87 told @entity89 : ' @entity41 continues to grow incredibly fast and we 're still a very small team when you think about the amount of people they are reaching			2
' there are many brands that use @entity41 right now to try to get a feel for how to engage with their followers			0
we will definitely be figuring out a monetisation strategy			0
' when that will happen , i ca n't comment , but it 's going to happen			0
' ms @entity87 pointedly avoided confirming that adverts would appear on the service , implying that the company may choose to use the wealth of data about @entity41 's users to make money			0
all photos uploaded from users ' mobile phones contain geotagged location data that reveals exactly where the picture was taken			0
that , combined with @entity0 's own facial recognition technology , gives the company a rich seam of data to mine			0
according to @entity123 , recent policy changes within the company mean that @entity41 user data can be directly passed on to @entity0 's corporate customers			0
the @entity123 comments : ' @entity0 could just clutter @entity41 with ads , but why would it ever risk that when @entity41 can instead serve as a data miner ’s wet dream ? ' given the nature of the service , even snapchat ceo @entity133 has acknowledged it seems inevitable to be used for explicit pictures , admitting : ' the minute you tell someone that images on your server disappear , everyone jumps to sexting			1
' @entity0 's version of the app offers pretty much the same service , allowing users to send messages to others that are viewable only for a set period			1
the move to come up with their own @entity2 - like app is just the latest in a string of aggressive moves by @entity0 to dominate the friend - to - friend communications market , @entity34 says			1
it 's just a fortnight since the social network giant updated its messenger app for @entity158 to allow people without a @entity0 account to send messages , in what was seen as an attempt to challenge to messaging service @entity164			1
the new service is likely to further worry parents who see the proliferation of @entity2 - like services as a potential lure to underage children to distribute explicit pictures of themselves			1
the website for the now controversial app features two young , pretty girls and the downloadable program is described as being rated for users over 12 years due in part to ' mild sexual content or nudity			0
' however , despite @entity2 's glossy promise to make photo retention harder than before , it has been shown that the program is not foolproof and is open to abuse			2
when a user attempts to take a screenshot of another person 's picture , @entity2 automatically notifies the sender but it does not stop the recipient from taking a screenshot nor can it prevent another phone or camera taking a picture of the original image			2
this has led to worries that the files sent via the service could nonetheless find their way on to the internet where the original sender quickly loses control of who can get their hands on the explicit images			0
mr @entity133 has denied that his social media tool could promote sexting among youngsters			0
' i ’m not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be , ' he said			0
' i just do n’t know people who do that			0
it does n’t seem that fun when you can have real sex			0
' nevertheless , he has told @entity221 that the @entity2 team is ' trying to do a better job educating our users and their parents , ' and that he was looking to add more guidance materials to their website soon .			2

like @entity2 , the new @entity0 service out by the end of the year would allow users to send picture messages with a time limit
however the @entity2 service has come under fire amid claims it encourages youngsters to send sexually explicit pictures
it has been shown that @entity2 pictures can be screengrabbed , meaning that the service does not offer the privacy it seems to claim
