by @entity0 the head of the @entity2 today called for all children to be taught cookery at school to help tackle the ' obesity timebomb ' and stop them wasting so much food			1
@entity9 , whose organisation has more than 200,000 members , believes compulsory lessons on the national curriculum would prepare pupils for adult life			1
her comments come after the @entity17 launched a food security campaign in an attempt to reduce the 15million tonnes of food @entity21 throws away each year			1
' excellent thing ' : @entity23 has called for all children to be taught cookery at school to improve their health and stop food wastage ministers are also considering whether to force schools to increase culinary teaching			1
mrs @entity9 said the education system had ' fallen down ' because cookery lessons were not ' taught widely '			1
she told @entity34 : ' good , healthy cooking leads to a healthy lifestyle			2
it is a holistic approach			0
we do n't want food wasted , but that is an issue in itself			1
this is a health issue as well			0
' if you give children these skills at an early age , it would go some way to tackling the obesity timebomb '			2
mrs @entity9 said lessons should focus on the basics , such as not over-cooking potatoes and how to buy and plan meals			1
she said the demands of modern life meant many children were living on a diet of ready meals because their parents were often too busy to cook			1
it would also help if more parents got their children into the kitchen with them , added mrs @entity9 , who admitted she was ' fortunate ' to learn from a mother who taught the subject			1
back to basics : mrs @entity9 says the education system had ' fallen down ' because cookery lessons were no longer taught widely ( file picture posed by models ) she added that the @entity17 , which has around 210,000 members in 6,500 branches , holds regular home - cooking courses for young parents so they can plan meals at home more effectively			1
speaking to the @entity77 , she said a useful tip would be to adapt recipes from books to include ingredients that need using up			1
she said : ' it is a case of planning what you are going to eat , make your list , and look in your cupboard to see if there is anything that would do			2
' mrs @entity9 also suggested that best - before dates do not have to be followed too religiously , especially if the food has not gone mouldy			1
getting stuck in : mrs @entity9 has also urged parents to encourage their children to help cook at home the @entity17 has enjoyed a long history of campaigning on behalf of women and their communities here 's a snapshot of some of the battles they have fought : the @entity17 's first campaign was on school dinner provision in 1926			1
in 1943 , almost 30 years before the law changed , a resolution from @entity17 in @entity105 demanding equal pay for equal work was passed at the agm			0
in 1954 , a resolution against litter was passed which eventually led to the formation of @entity112			0
in 1964 @entity113 in @entity114 won the support of the agm on a resolution against smoking in public places			0
during the 1970s , the @entity17 lobbied for the introduction of breast screening clinics – this resulted in the government introducing a number of mobile screening clinics followed by a national screening programme for all women aged 50 – 64 , the first of its kind in the @entity130			0
the 80s saw the @entity17 call for public facing information campaigns on @entity133 and @entity134			0
more recently the @entity17 has worked to raise awareness on the nature and extent of violence against women , tackled excess packaging and focussed on the plight of the honeybee			0
source : @entity17 a @entity145 spokesman said : ' decisions on the subjects to be included in the secondary @entity148 will be announced in due course , but nothing will prevent schools from teaching practical cookery			0
' we know that a healthy attitude towards food , developed early , is critical to the health and well - being of young people			2
' we are currently looking at the role food and cooking plays in schools and how this can help children develop an understanding of food and nutrition			1
' the @entity17 was set up during the @entity167 to encourage women to tighten their belts and make the most of their meagre household budgets			0
last month , it was revealed that , due to the recession , record numbers of young women are once again turning to the organisation to learn vital ' make do and mend ' skills			2
in the last three years , 56,500 women have joined the @entity17 , which has a total membership of around 210,000 in @entity180 and @entity181			0
the influence of the @entity17 was highlighted in 2007 when @entity183 credited the organisation with turning its fortunes around			2
facing falling sales amid accusations that the store had stopped listening to its customers , then chief executive @entity189 turned to the @entity17 for help			0
about 800 @entity17 members in @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 were invited to form a focus group which would help guide the company			0
they gave precise guidance on how to improve individual garments - advice which the store said has helped it improve its profits			0
it even credited members for doubling the order of a fluted printed skirt on sale in some stores the previous year			2
the women gave the nod of approval to several items which went on to become hits , including last season 's checked waterfallfront jacket , modelled by @entity214 in advertisements			0
the organisation was created in 1915 and is preparing for its centenary in 2015 .			2
