leading historians yesterday backed calls for schools to stop showing @entity3 to children learning about the @entity5			2
they sided with @entity6 after he said the comedy @entity7 and shows such as the @entity9 and oh ! what a @entity10 wrongly depicted @entity12 ’s military efforts as a ‘ misbegotten shambles ’			1
@entity15 historian professor @entity14 and fellow @entity5 expert professor @entity16 said the @entity17 was right to criticise shows like @entity3 – although they differed sharply on his broader point that the conflict had been a ‘ just war ’			2
historians have backed claims that programmes such as @entity7 ( pictured ) depict @entity12 military efforts as ' misbegotten shambles ' professor @entity14 said : ‘ i do n’t think teachers should be showing @entity3 in history lessons – and i think some of them are			1
there is plenty of excellent material on the @entity5 they can use			0
’ professor @entity16 added : ‘ i am glad @entity6 has put this into the public domain			2
‘ people do pick up their views on the @entity5 from shows like @entity3 and @entity38			0
i ’m a fan of both , but they should not be taken as being documentaries			0
’ writing for the @entity41 yesterday as @entity12 prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity5 , mr @entity6 said only ‘ undergraduate cynics ’ would say soldiers had fought in vain			1
he said the war was necessary to curb @entity49 ’s ‘ aggressively expansionist ’ aims			0
he also hit out at professor @entity14 ’s claims that troops were wrong to believe the war was about defending freedom			0
but the academic , speaking on @entity54 ’s world at one yesterday , attacked mr @entity6 ’s interpretation of the war , saying he was ‘ peddling his own political myths ’			1
professor @entity14 said : ‘ he wants to argue @entity12 was fighting for democracy but he has obviously forgotten that @entity12 ’s main ally was @entity59 – a despotism far greater than anything in the @entity62 ’s @entity49			0
speaking ahead of the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity5 mr @entity6 said only ' undergraduate cynics ' would say soldiers had fought in vain ' you also have to remember that only 40 per cent of adult men had the vote in @entity12			1
‘ the war was a very complex set of circumstances and it is wrong of mr @entity6 to reduce it to patriotic tub - thumping that we should support the soldiers			1
' of course no one wants to belittle their heroism and self - sacrifice , but we have to look at the war in the round and the long term			0

‘ it ’s a war we should be very glad the @entity97 ended up winning , ’ he added			0
@entity7 , which starred @entity98 in the title role as a captain in 1917 @entity101 , chronicles his increasingly gutless efforts to dodge the action and is shown in some schools to help children learn about the war			0
