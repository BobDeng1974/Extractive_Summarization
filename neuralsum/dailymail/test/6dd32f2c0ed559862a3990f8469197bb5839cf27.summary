a man has spent a year losing 70lbs so he could donate his kidney to his wife			1
@entity3 was delighted when he discovered he was a perfect match for wife @entity5 , who was told her life - long battle with @entity7 would kill her if she did n't get a transplant			1
the waiting list is seven years long			2
but the next day the couple from @entity11 , @entity12 , were dealt a blow : his blood pressure was too high to perform the operation			1
refusing to accept the diagnosis , @entity17 embarked on a relentless fitness regime			1
finally , in december 2014 , they got the green light			0
in february , they went under the knife together			2
on the transplant list , she would have had to wait seven years made it ! after a year of grueling dieting and exercise , @entity17 was given the green light to undergo surgery ' we both just feel amazing			1
i 'm slowly getting back to work making music , @entity5 is making sure she fully recovers			2
but the entire process has been amazing			0
' now 39 , @entity5 was six when she was first diagnosed with the chronic inflammatory disease which affects her kidney functions			2
she was placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after her 34 - year - old sister , who also had @entity7 , died following complications from a kidney transplant			1
knowing that the seven - year wait might be too long , @entity17 , a self - employed musician , submitted himself for the weeks - long evaluation to assess whether he could donate his kidney			1
journey : for a year , he kept losing weight and going in for tests , only to be told he needed to lose more finally , he visited @entity58 's @entity57 hospital in december 2014 , and the numbers all matched up however , the good news was tinged with disappointment as doctors said his size meant the operation could n't go ahead			2
' they said i was a perfect match but they wanted to check i was healthy and met their requirements			1
they sent me a blood pressure monitor , but they did n't like the numbers			1
' that was a real kick in the gut			0
' the doctors advised @entity17 , who weighed 265lbs , to lose 30lbs before returning for an evaluation			0
he did - but on the day of the test he changed a flat tire			0
' my blood pressure was all over the place			1
the results came back and they said no again			0
' it did n't stop there			0
next try was a hospital in @entity89 , @entity90 , where he was told to another 60lbs			0
eventually , they made it to @entity58 's @entity95 in december 2014			0
@entity17 made sure he did everything he could to ensure the readings were perfect			2
' i put that blood pressure monitor on and lay in bed all day			1
and thankfully , it all came back good ! ' undergoing the four - hour surgery together on february 24 , the couple took a beaming photograph in matching hospital gowns			1
life saver : special needs teacher @entity5 , 39 , has suffered from @entity108 , a chronic inflammatory disease , since she was six			1
in 2013 , doctors in @entity11 , @entity12 , said she would need a kidney transplant to survive happy : @entity3 ( pictured in hospital ) described the feeling of dejection at every hurdle until they made it perfect match : the chances of being a perfect match for one 's spouse is rare the couple , who married in 2003 , are now back home and recovering in @entity11 gift ! this was the festive @entity126 gift given to @entity5 and @entity17 by @entity57 hospital ' the way my kidney function is now , it 's at 100 percent			1
and it 's at the best it 's ever been , ' @entity5 , a special needs teacher , told @entity134			2
@entity17 told @entity135 : ' it has just been amazing			0
to know that i did everything i could to give my wife a better quality of life is just the best feeling			0
' the couple 's friends have now set up a fund to financially support them during the two - month recovery period when they will be unable to work			0
it reads : ' while the actual cost of the kidney transplant itself would be covered , they would need at least two months of financial assistance to cover regular household expenses as neither of them will be able to work during their recovery			0
your donations would be emensely appreciated			0

@entity3 was perfect match for wife @entity5 , who suffers from @entity108
but he was told he was not eligible as his blood pressure was too high
she was placed on the seven - year - long transplant list at end of 2013
@entity3 embarked on year - long fitness regime until he made the grade
they both underwent surgery in february 2015
