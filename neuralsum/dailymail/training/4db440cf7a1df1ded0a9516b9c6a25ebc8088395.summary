very sad ' : how @entity1 described himself in the recent interview with @entity7 ' when he saw my handgun and looked at it and told me that he was going to kill me that night , uh , that was enough of a threat after the way he had attacked me			2
so , i felt his hand going for my weapon , ' @entity1 said , reports the @entity26			0
when asked how he feels now , @entity1 responded ' @entity27			0
' @entity1 was found not guilty of murder in the controversial case in 2013			0
insight : @entity1 told @entity7 that he receives death threats due to bad media coverage , not the fact that he shot @entity5 he told @entity7 that after shooting @entity5 , his main concern was that he had missed his target			1
' i was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go ... get lost , and , um , you know , go into a house and - because the young man was still talking to me , as i have said			0
so i thought that it had n't ... affected him , and i got worried , and i said , " i hope that it has n't - that the bullet has n't hit a neighbor , " ' @entity1 said			0
the much - maligned former insurance salesman who has recently taken to selling his unique art on @entity49 said he was ' 100 per cent ' sure of his actions that night , and that had he not shot @entity5 , the teen would have killed him			2
international notoriety : @entity1 's case became known around the world @entity1 said that he has had death threats since the trial , which he put down to his portrayal in the media and not his shooting of a teenaged boy			2
@entity1 told @entity7 that he can no longer lead a normal life and must wear a bullet - proof vest when he is out in public			1
