maybe come the season ’s end , @entity0 will look back to @entity3 and realise that was when @entity6 ’s fortunes finally turned			1
this was a day that had all the elements to give @entity0 nightmares : freezing cold conditions , incessant , squally rain , a home side high on energy and endeavour and @entity6 bedecked in that dreadful yellow kit , the one they always seem to lose in			1
they might have lost wearing it again at @entity21			1
for sizeable parts of this collision with @entity24 , @entity6 were second best and had they gone in at half - time two goals down , @entity0 could have had no complaints			1
he has , after all , seen his team capsize in similar conditions			0
improvement , undoubtedly , is required for them to reach the top four next may but sometimes a team needs an afternoon like this to send them in the right direction			0
after drawing with @entity55 , @entity6 had to follow up by beating @entity24			1
bold words are all well and good but they need to have substance to be taken seriously , so having insisted @entity6 were “ absolutely ” capable of reaching the top four following their 2 - 2 draw with @entity55 , @entity0 required a similarly robust performance			1
for much of the first 45 minutes , he would have been tempted to watch the action unfold with hands clasped over his face			0
@entity6 were wretched , only posing a sporadic threat on the break , as @entity24 scuffled and scurried and knocked them out of their stride			1
nobody was busier than the impressive @entity68 and he almost opened the scoring in the 14th minute when @entity6 ’s defence froze and , with @entity71 rooted to his spot , he thrashed a right - footed drive that thudded against the post before rebounding to safety			1
that proved to be @entity71 ’ last involvement as he was substituted immediately – @entity0 would later reveal he damaged his thigh – replaced by @entity79			0
what became immediately apparent , was the break from the team had not done anything for @entity79 ’s confidence as in the first five minutes he was on the pitch , he flapped at two crosses and had one clearance charged down by @entity68			0
@entity32 kept his composure with two @entity24 defenders rushing back and picked his spot at the near post to give @entity6 the lead the goal on the hour mark was @entity32 's third in his last three appearances while playing as a striker @entity24 : @entity35 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 ( @entity101 90 ) , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity71 ( @entity104 83 ) , @entity105 , @entity68 , @entity106 ( @entity107 80 )			1
subs not used : @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112			0
@entity6 : @entity71 ( @entity79 16 ) , @entity113 46 ) , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 ( @entity121 73 ) , @entity32 , @entity122			1
subs not used : @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127			0
referee : @entity130 ( @entity131 )			0
captain @entity117 covered a lot of ground in the midfield for @entity6 as his head map ( above ) shows - click here for match zone @entity24 ’s supporters preyed on his vulnerability , taunting him as he prepared to take goal kicks , and it was hard not to feel some sympathy for the @entity143 ; he resembled a golfer with a severe case of the ‘ yips ’ , every kick resembling a skewwhiff drive being sliced out of bounds			1
sensing a chance to take advantage , @entity24 upped the tempo			0
their work was relentless and intense , it unsettled @entity6 and enabled them to start creating chances			2
with better fortune and sharper finishing , they would have sewn matters up before the interval			0
@entity68 went close with a header after one quick break ; @entity79 was grateful to @entity118 when the @entity162 diverted a shot from @entity164 around the post ; @entity102 thrashed another right - footed drive just over the bar			2
play like this from january to may and they will stay up			0
other a one tame shot from @entity122 , which @entity35 comfortably dealt with , @entity6 offered nothing and it was with good reason there was a collective sigh of relief when half - time was called			1
against different opposition , they would not have been so fortunate			0
@entity143 goalkeeper @entity79 made a return to the @entity6 team as he replaced the injured @entity71 @entity181 goalkeeper @entity71 looked dejected after being forced off with an apparent thigh injury at @entity21 @entity0 marched back to the sanctuary of @entity6 ’s dressing room with much to consider and he sent his players out for the second period early , having made another adjustment with @entity189 replacing @entity187 , who had suffered most at the hands of @entity68			1
that meant @entity6 had only two natural defenders but the brave call soon began to pay dividends ; can , usually a midfielder , gave @entity6 more assurance and he used possession more competently than @entity187			2
the more they kept the ball , the more they frustrated @entity24			0
soon the change in momentum became obvious			0
@entity24 ’s supporters , having been so loud , began to lose voice and in the 63rd minute , they saw their team drop their guard and , in the blink of an eye , they had been undone by a classic sucker - punch			2
there did not seem to be any danger when @entity118 jumped for a ball inside his own half but the @entity162 ’s header found @entity120 , who in turn ushered @entity32 forward with a perfectly weighted lofted pass			2
@entity6 's defence struggled to deal with @entity24 in the first half and they could n't put together any meaningful attacks either @entity6 's @entity116 falls awkwardly after jumping for a header with @entity24 's @entity218 @entity6 manager @entity0 and @entity24 boss @entity219 shake hands before the game at @entity21 @entity32 did not need a second invitation to streak away and as @entity35 sped out to try and divert the danger , the @entity224 winger jinked around his challenge before rolling the ball into the net in front of the @entity230 , which housed @entity6 ’s supporters			1
such was @entity0 ’ relief , he repeatedly pointed at @entity32 , seemingly praising and thanking him in equal measure			2
coming so soon after @entity114 ’s point - saving header on sunday , this was another big goal for @entity6 and , perhaps , further evidence that they can get to where they want to be ‘ we had to show a different side to us , different types of qualities to what we showed against @entity55 and @entity242 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the home crowd gotbehind the team , a team that is always in the game			2
@entity24 do n’t concede too many , so my players deserved huge credit			0
’ for the plaudits to continue , the results must keep coming and @entity250 are up next on monday			0
there is no margin for error but keep winning like this and @entity0 will not be complaining			0
a tribute for former @entity24 defender @entity256 is displayed on the big screen in one corner of @entity21 @entity24 supporters stand to applaud for @entity256 , who is in hospital after being hit by a lorry before @entity262 @entity32 did not need a second invitation to streak away and as @entity35 sped out to try and divert the danger , the @entity224 winger jinked around his challenge before rolling the ball into the net in front of the @entity230 , which housed @entity6 ’s supporters			1
such was @entity0 ’ relief , he repeatedly pointed at @entity32 , seemingly praising and thanking him in equal measure			2
this was another big goal for @entity6 and , perhaps , further evidence that their fortunes are changing .			2

@entity32 scored just after the hour mark to earn @entity6 three points at @entity21
the 20 - year - old rounded @entity35 before slotting into the empty net to give @entity6 the lead
@entity6 win their first @entity284 game since 3 - 1 victory at @entity286 on *december* 6
