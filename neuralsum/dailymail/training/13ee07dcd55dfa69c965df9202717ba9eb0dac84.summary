@entity0 has revealed he will be on ' alert until the last minute ' as pressure mounts on the @entity4 boss to sign a replacement for @entity6 before the transfer window closes			1
@entity6 has been ruled out until next year with a broken foot which he sustained in @entity4 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity10 last saturday			1
but while @entity0 , who was speaking ahead of his side 's match against @entity13 on sunday , did n't rule out movement in the market , he also hinted that he may not add to his squad before the deadline of 11pm on monday			1
why not ? the success of the season does not depend on one player that you buy or not , ' @entity0 said			1
' if i give you the number of strikers we have at the moment , it 's absolutely unbelievable			2
we have @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			2
' @entity6 will be back during the season and @entity39 can play centre - forward as well			1
' you sign players when you think it strengthens your squad			2
if you find the right player , then you want to do it			2
' we 've shown in the last two seasons that when we think money has to be spent , we do it			2
but we want to do it in the right way			2
' i will be on alert until the last minute of the transfer deadline			1
' in action : @entity39 played in @entity56 ' 4 - 2 win over @entity57 on thursday night injury blow : @entity6 has been ruled out until next year with a broken foot sustained at @entity10 former @entity61 striker @entity60 stated on thursday that @entity4 must add firepower if they are to win major silverware as £ 35million signing @entity35 , who started as the lone striker against @entity10 and @entity65 , is more suited a wider role			1
' we live in a society of opinions , ' @entity0 said			1
' people are better informed these days			0
many of them are better informed than i am			0
but all of these opinions do n't mean people are right			0
' everyone is entitled to an opinion , but that does n't mean it 's right			0
' in fact , when opinions have been wrong in the past , people have never come out and say " sorry i was wrong " - the easiest thing is to have an opinion			0
' on target : @entity35 operated the lone striker role against @entity65			0
he scored on the stroke of half - time @entity0 believes if any suitable targets become available , his experience of doing business on deadline day should prove helpful			1
twelve months ago @entity94 completed a late £ 42.4million move from @entity96 and two years prior to that @entity97 was among three players signed in a last - gasp flurry of deals			0
' it 's harder to buy top , top players because many clubs are on the market and everybody knows each other , ' @entity0 said			1
' the last few days are poker games			0
there are a lot of lies there and everyone is interested in the same player , even if you 're the only one who wants the player			0
' of course ( having experience of operating late in the window helps )			0
you can call it bluff when it 's bluff			0
' having qualified for the group stage of the @entity124 on wednesday night , @entity4 resume their @entity126 campaign at promoted @entity13 on sunday			1
@entity0 recalls his visit to the @entity128 in 1997 early in his @entity130 reign when @entity131 scored a hat - trick in a remarkable 3 - 3 draw			1
' i remember the first sensational goal with @entity131			0
many times i have said that that goal is one of the greatest goals i 've seen in my career , ' @entity0 said			2
' it was also my first experience with @entity140 - he did n't understand why i took him off			0
' i wanted to spare him some minutes at the end of the game , but @entity140 was always keen to play			0
