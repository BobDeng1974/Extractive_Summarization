by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 27 september 2013 their families are now joined forever through marriage			0
so it is appropriate that the coats of arms of the houses of @entity8 and @entity9 are firmly entwined as well			2
although @entity8 ’s ancestors include carpenters and coal miners , they had their own heraldic design drawn up in 2011 , shortly before the royal wedding			1
@entity16 released this photo of the new conjugal coat of arms for the @entity19 and @entity8 and yesterday the duchess of @entity19 ’s personal emblem was linked , for the first time , with that of her husband to create a new ‘ @entity25 ’			1
designed by the @entity27 in @entity28 , it represents @entity29 and @entity8 , in heraldic terms , as a married couple			1
the @entity8 coat of arms – which was applied for by @entity8 ’s father @entity33 – features three leafy acorns to represent his children			1
acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks			0
@entity40 is also a symbol of @entity42 and strength , and @entity44 , where the children were brought up , has many oak trees			0
in the centre of @entity8 ’s emblem is a gold chevron representing the @entity51 ’s mother , @entity50 , at the heart of the family			2
her family name was @entity55			0
the insignia will be the couple 's coat of arms forever , but parts of it could change the two thin white chevrons on either side indicate , remarkably , the family ’s love of skiing and mountains , while the background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principal colours of the flag of the @entity71 and match @entity29 ’s own shield			1
@entity29 ’s design is a version of the @entity75 which was granted to him by the @entity76 on his 18th birthday			1
it shows the various royal emblems of the @entity71 : the three lions of @entity42 , the lion of @entity82 and the harp of @entity84			0
it is surrounded by a blue garter bearing the motto @entity87 – shame to those who think evil of it – which symbolises the @entity92 of which he is a @entity95			0
both shields are supported by the @entity19 ’s ‘ supporters ’ – a royal lion and unicorn , each wearing a three pointed collar , known as a label			1
@entity103 and @entity104 in @entity42 , @entity102 unveils the new @entity25 for @entity8 's family in 2011 the label has a red scallop shell derived from the @entity109 coat of arms , which has been used by the ancestors of princess @entity111 for centuries			1
flowing out from the top of the @entity114 is ‘ mantling ’ , which represents the slashed cloth hung around the necks of knights fighting in the heat of the @entity120 during the @entity121			0
@entity122 , of the @entity27 , said : ‘ any married couple who are both entitled to arms are entitled to combine them in a @entity114			0
‘ there are different rules and conventions as to how this works , depending on who the individual is , but as the @entity19 is a @entity92 his is encircled by the blue garter bearing its motto			2
‘ as his wife is not , a wreath was made to balance hers out decoratively			0
obviously that will change if she , in the future , is made a member herself			0
’ a spokesman for @entity16 added : ‘ the @entity141 will be the couple ’s coat of arms forever , but parts of it could change as their own circumstances and roles change			1
‘ it was approved by the @entity76 earlier this year and can now be shown publicly for the first time .			2
