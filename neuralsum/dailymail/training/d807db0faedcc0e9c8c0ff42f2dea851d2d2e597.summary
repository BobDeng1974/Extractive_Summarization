@entity0 can equal a club record of nine consecutive victories with success at @entity4 on @entity5			1
city have hit form in the past month , with their sequence of eight straight wins carrying them into the @entity10 's last 16 and cutting into @entity12 's lead at the top of the @entity14			1
they trail @entity12 by just three points heading into the @entity18 league fixtures having - briefly - been as many as nine behind at one stage last month			1
@entity0 trained on christmas eve ahead of their @entity14 boxing day trip to @entity4 @entity12 have responded to the champions ' reinvigorated challenge by winning their last two but , after enduring an indifferent spell in october and november , @entity0 clearly have momentum			1
manager @entity26 said : ' we are playing now with the intensity and in style of play we always do			1
again we have players in high level of performance and good moments			2
' we are trusting in what we do so , in the same way maybe we played in a poor way two months ago , we are doing very well			0
' victory at @entity39 will see @entity0 match a feat of winning nine in succession that they have only achieved twice before			1
the first time was in the old @entity43 between december 1909 and february 1910 , with the second their much more recent hot streak of autumn 2011			0
@entity45 ( centre ) will be looking to add to his two - goal exploits against @entity48 on saturday the latter sequence , when @entity0 truly asserted themselves in what was to prove their first @entity14 title - winning season , most memorably included their 6 - 1 destruction of @entity54 at @entity55			1
last season they did win 18 out of 20 games across december and january but the most they won in succession was seven			0
their latest strong run was partly sparked by the brilliance of @entity62 - most obviously by his brilliant hat - trick against @entity64 last month - but @entity0 have been without their star striker for the last three games			1
the @entity67 is likely to be out another month with his knee injury and @entity26 , although confident his team can maintain their momentum , acknowledges they need him back soon			1
@entity71 ( right ) is back in training after overcoming a hamstring injury he said : ' it is enough for me for us just to continue ( playing ) in the same way - i do n't know if better things will come			0
' in this moment we are playing in a high level but we always need to return , as soon as we can , @entity62 and all the other players that are injured			0
' city are also without their other senior strikers , @entity84 and @entity71			0
midfielder @entity85 operated as a makeshift centre - forward for last week 's victory over @entity48 with @entity45 , who scored twice , behind him			2
that arrangement could be repeated at @entity4 but @entity71 is back in training could soon return after a hamstring injury			1
@entity0 's defence has also shown marked improvement during their recent run of form , with just one goal conceded in six games			1
they have recorded four clean sheets in succession and , encouragingly , three of those have been secured without influential captain @entity99			0
midfielder @entity100 ( centre ) attempts to win the ball from @entity103 ( right ) during a training drill @entity103 , who initially struggled after his Â£ 32million arrival from @entity106 , now seems to be finding his feet and @entity108 , the subject of much derision last season , is proving a solid performer			0
@entity26 said : ' you can play with more trust if you do n't concede a goal			2
if not , and you are one goal behind , you start playing faster than you need to			0
it is very important to keep our clean sheet			0
' with the defensive mistakes now fewer , the decision to release @entity120 - whom @entity0 will face at the @entity39 - at the end of last season seems justified			2
@entity120 , 32 , was a key performer in the 2011 - 12 title success but struggled to command a regular place in the final two years of his contract			0
@entity26 said : ' every squad needs change every year			2
he is 33 , 34 ( sic ) years old			0
we thought it was better for him to continue for another club			2
' i was always very happy with his performance for us last year because he is a very good player and an intelligent player			0
' @entity4 defender @entity120 will face his former club for the first time since he leaving this summer			1

@entity0 travel to @entity4 in the @entity14 on @entity5
@entity0 can equal club record of nine consecutive wins on *friday*
@entity26 's side sit second , three points behind leaders @entity12
