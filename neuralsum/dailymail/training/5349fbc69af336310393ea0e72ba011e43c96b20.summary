@entity1 manager @entity0 is not to blame for the team 's position at the bottom of the @entity5 , according to @entity6 midfielder @entity7			1
@entity0 's side were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity9 on sunday meaning the team have taken just four points from their opening seven league games			1
@entity1 's defeat was compounded by a sluggish display that has placed added scrutiny on @entity0 and his ability to motivate his under - performing players			1
@entity7 said @entity0 is not to blame for @entity1 's poor form after their defeat to @entity9 ' it is easy to blame the manager when you lose but the players have to step up , ' said @entity7 , who came on for 24 minutes at @entity25 but is yet to start a match this season			1
' the manager can change tactics , tell us what he wants , but when we go on the pitch it is the players who perform			0
' it is disappointing , we are bottom of the league			0
' if we keep clean sheets we can win games , but at the moment we are not doing that so it is hard for us			0
' @entity1 were relegated under @entity0 during his first season in charge and could be again this season @entity0 said his players ' fitness was not up to scratch after the @entity9 defeat , with a number of his squad still regaining sharpness after injury			1
@entity7 has been struggling with an ankle problem since the summer and the talented @entity51 is still trying to re-establish himself at @entity52 after a permanent move to @entity54 break down in the summer			1
' i was in the middle of a transfer and it did not happen for whatever reason , ' @entity7 said			2
' it was difficult for me because i thought i was moving			0
in the end it did not happen , so i am now and have to work hard to get back in the team and help @entity1 win games			2
the talented @entity51 midfielder , who was on loan at @entity54 last year , said the players were to blame ' these two weeks for the international break will help me get to 100 per cent			1
i did not have a very good pre-season and i need games			0
hopefully my ankle will be fine , it is not a big injury			0
' @entity7 scored four goals in 14 league appearances while on loan at @entity54 last season and the 25 - year - old admits he had hoped to sign permanently for the @entity80 giants in the summer			1
' i had a taste of something different last year , playing in the @entity83 at a big club [ while on loan at @entity54 ] , ' @entity7 said			2
' that is why i wanted to move			0
not because i do want to be at @entity1 , because it was a big opportunity for me			2
' do not forget that this club has helped me a lot			0
i am one of the longest - serving players here now , and i still love the club			0
it will always be in my heart			0
i am very concentrated on @entity1 and giving my best			2
