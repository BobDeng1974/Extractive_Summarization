by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 11 september 2013 thousands of birds filled the skies today when unusually high tides temporarily submerged their natural habitat			1
the wading birds , which find their food in the wetlands of @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , took to the air when advancing waters covered their usual stomping ground			1
spectacular flights , which feature oystercatchers , plover , godwits and geese , only occur a few times a year when tides in the area are exceptionally high			0
birds including knots , oystercatchers , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 and @entity27 took to the sky in search of food the birds flood into the sky after rising tides covered their regular feeding ground birdwatchers look on at the natural phenomenon , which takes place only a few times per year in very high tides faced with the encroaching waters , these waders took to the sky the images of the majestic formations were captured above the @entity45 's nature reserve in @entity9 , a protected and vital habitat which is home to over 300,000 birds			1
the stunning photographs show the birds , separated into their different species , peeling off into the sky in search of their next meal			0
appreciative birdwatchers looked on as the mass of birds took to the skies above the reserve , home to many species which are difficult to encounter elsewhere			2
but , though the images may look like a mass migration , with the birds quitting the area for good , their relocation was short - lived			0
pink - footed geese and waders ( left ) join amassed oystercatchers in their hunt for food these long - beaked godwits were among the wading birds which temporarily relocated the greylag geese in this pictured headed for a lake during the high tides these oystercatchers returned to their old feeding ground after the tide receded these oystercatchers and knots are so thickly gathered that the ground beneath them can hardly be seen only hours after the high tide had reached its peak , the wetlands which provide the resident birds with all their food were visible once more and the resident species of the @entity9 reserve could return home			2
the reserve is situated alongside @entity8 , one of the country 's most important estuaries for bird life , which contains 10 per cent of the nation 's salt marsh			0
it is fed by the rivers @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 which drain into @entity8 from the surrounding counties of @entity10 and @entity107			0
these waders found their wetlands wetter than usual after a high tide covered much of their food these godwits had to turn elsewhere for food after their usual habitat on @entity8 ( right ) was covered by rising waters the birds headed home once the tides returned to normal after the tides , the birds could return to these wetlands , which sustain thousands of birds the @entity8 , pictured here after the tide had receded , supports over 300,000 birds			1

the birds filled the skies today above @entity9 , @entity10
the @entity45 nature reserve on @entity8 is home to over 300,000 birds
they took to the skies after high waters covered their feeding grounds
