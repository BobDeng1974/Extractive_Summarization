sorry to come over all nostalgic while a football carnival is unfolding in @entity1 and the world ’s grandest tennis tournament is taking place , but what choice have we @entity6 sports enthusiasts got ? this pining for better times is not just brought about by poor @entity11 ’s tennis yesterday being as flat as his vowels			1
it is the result of failure after failure from our national sportsmen this year : our rugby players whitewashed in @entity19 , our cricketers losing a series at home to @entity23 for the first time and our footballers going out of the @entity26 before the @entity27 had even got @entity28 out there			1
down and out : @entity11 is the latest from our shores to have lost on the biggest stage recently it 's over : the defending @entity34 champion was beaten in straight sets 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 2 by @entity36 we must hold judgment on this — the @entity39 , @entity40 , the @entity41 await us — but we are in grave danger of seeing 2014 turning into an anti- 2012			1
ah , those blissful seven months between the late - spring and mid-winter of 2012			1
the conventions of lifetimes watching @entity6 sport were inverted			2
our heroes were not gallant losers , but imperious winners			2
at the centre of it all was the @entity52 , arguably the best thing we have accomplished as a country since winning the @entity55			2
we lit up the flame and we lit up the world , as @entity58 told the @entity59			2
across sport , fairytales were turning true			2
no @entity6 man had won a @entity64 tournament for 76 years until @entity11 clinched the @entity66 title that year			1
knocked out early : @entity67 did n't manage to get through their tough group at this summer 's @entity26 @entity69 apologises to fans that did n't go to plan ! @entity67 's test team lost the first series of this summer against tourists @entity23 @entity77 back captain cook and as for the @entity79 , here is the verdict of @entity82 sports writer @entity81 after @entity83 finished the penultimate day 10 - 6 down			1
‘ for those who think this @entity79 is finished , think again , ’ he mused			2
‘ @entity86 can still win if the following five things happen sunday : 1			1
@entity90 captain @entity89 inserts @entity26 spectators @entity92 , president @entity93 , @entity94 and the @entity95 into the singles line - up			1
@entity99 shows @entity86 captain @entity100 how to go back in time			2
last friday morning will do			2
@entity86 wins eight of the remaining 12 matches to retain the @entity26			1
’ nice one @entity81 , old buddy , but @entity104 holed from five feet to clinch victory 14½ - 13½			1
where did the time go ? @entity104 holed from five feet to clinch @entity79 victory two years ago the @entity39 had always been as @entity108 as brie and baguettes			2
as @entity111 , brother of @entity112 , the first @entity113 to win a stage of the great race , once said : ‘ if you can imagine a @entity117 scoring a century at @entity118 , then you can imagine an @entity67 winning a stage of the @entity39			1
’ yet , in 2012 , @entity120 won the whole tour			0
our relationship with the bicycle changed dramatically at that moment			0
the year 2012 even saw @entity126 win the championship of @entity67			1
it ’s no big deal nowadays , but it was then : they had not achieved the feat in 44 seasons			0
it was dramatic , too , @entity133 scoring the late winner against @entity135			0
as for cricket , we hailed the qualities of @entity139 on dusty @entity141 pitches			0
@entity139 scored three tons , taking him to 23 test centuries — the most by any @entity67			1
it beat the record set by @entity145 73 years earlier			0
@entity139 brings us back , unhappily , to today			0
@entity139 is a fabulous batsman of conspicuous gumption ( form is temporary etc ) but a ludicrously negative captain			0
a new era : @entity139 opted to blood youngsters @entity152 ( left ) and @entity153 against @entity23 losing the series to @entity23 can be attributed to his decision not to declare , say , 45 minutes before the close of the fourth day of the @entity157			1
instead he allowed @entity153 to score a maiden hundred and declared overnight			0
sir @entity23 were nine wickets down by the dismal , avoidable conclusion			1
it is my theory that there are too many ‘ support staff ’ around modern sportsmen for them to think for themselves			0
so @entity67 had an 80 - strong party at football ’s @entity26 , yet @entity82 went further in the tournament			1
what about @entity174 , the mind doctor who is credited with having helped @entity176 and @entity177 ? he was brought in to prepare @entity67 ’s footballers			1
fat lot of good that did			0
and let ’s not forget that one of his charges was @entity185 , the not - so - reformed cannibal of football			2
if good people think @entity174 is worthwhile — and @entity189 , sir @entity190 and @entity191 are among his supporters — that is an outstanding statement on his work			0
nevertheless , these huge retinues seem to be bloated products of over-funding , the bastard brother of the @entity200 era , which said loads of money and lots of people were the answer to everything			0
it is the downside of what was an upside			0
even nostalgia , it seems , is not what it was			0
the real deal ? @entity174 is a consultant psychiatrist with @entity177 and went to the @entity26 @entity212 became the third - quickest @entity6 100m sprinter of all - time when he ran 9.96secs in @entity215			1
the men ’s four — @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 — and the women ’s pair of @entity223 and @entity224 won @entity83 rowing gold in @entity226			0
@entity227 won last weekend on the @entity82 @entity228 at @entity229			0
double @entity231 champion @entity230 broke her @entity233 world 100m and 200m records and set a world 1500m best			0
@entity236 became the first @entity6 table tennis player to win a world tour singles event for 18 years when he took gold at the @entity241 in april			0
@entity242 won the prestigious heptathlon in @entity244 , @entity245 — which doubles as a mini-world championship — with a personal best of 6,682 points , the best tally in the world this year			0
@entity67 women ’s football team have reeled off eight straight wins in their bid to qualify for the @entity254 , to be held in @entity255 next june			1

@entity259 's side left the @entity26 in @entity1 early
@entity67 's test team went down to @entity23 in the first summer series
@entity11 beaten in straight sets 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 2 by @entity36
