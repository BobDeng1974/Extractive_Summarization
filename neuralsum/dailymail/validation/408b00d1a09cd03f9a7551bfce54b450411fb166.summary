@entity0 has received support in the form of action movie star @entity3 , who claims the @entity7 leader 's re-election is crucial for the safety of the country			1
in a short @entity11 video called please vote for prime minister @entity0 , @entity3 , 75 , said : ' i watched prime minister @entity0 's speech before @entity14 , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul			1
i also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the @entity7 people			1
' i have done three movies in @entity7 – ' @entity24 ' being my favorite – and i formed many friendships while there			2
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way			0
' you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way ' : @entity3 , 75 , has made an intervention into the @entity7 election , calling on @entity0 to be re-elected ' courage and vision ' : @entity3 believes that @entity0 is the leader who can stand up against the ' evil forces ' threatening both @entity7 and the @entity40 ' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only @entity7 but also the @entity40			1
' you see , we , the @entity40 people , need prime minister @entity0 as much as you do			2
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on @entity40 , too			0
' so i ask you , please , for the sake of @entity7 and the whole @entity57 , vote for prime minister @entity0 on @entity58			1
' and as far as those in the @entity40 and the rest of the world , in this season of @entity64 , it 's good to remember what the @entity65 say about @entity7 and those who support her : " pray for the peace of @entity69 : may they prosper who love you " ( @entity73 )			1
' @entity3 , star of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ; and the subject of countless internet memes and jokes , backed mr @entity0 during the last @entity7 election			1
he is also not the only @entity83 star to lend his support to mr @entity0			2
@entity85 , the @entity86 winner and father of @entity88 , released a video last week voicing his support as well as his disdain for @entity91 , saying ' president @entity91 does not love @entity7 '			1
he follows this up by saying : ' his whole agenda is to control @entity7			2
in this way , he can be friends with all of @entity7 ’s enemies			0
' he further says in the @entity98 video : ' he [ @entity91 ] does n’t want @entity0 to win this upcoming election			1
@entity40 has not been the same since his presidency			0
i beg all of you to understand the truth			0
' mr @entity0 meanwhile reiterated an appeal to hard - liners , posting on his @entity107 page that high @entity109 voter turnout was endangering his right - wing party 's dominance			2
' @entity109 voters are going to the polls in droves			0
left wing organizations are bringing them in buses , ' he said			0
he also called on supporters to vote for him to ' narrow the gap ' between @entity121 and the @entity122			0
' with your help , and with the help of @entity127 , we will build a nationalist government that will protect the state of @entity7 , ' he said			0
a new joint list of @entity109 parties , unifying four factions , has energized @entity109 voters and is poised to make big gains in the race			0
@entity7 's @entity109 make up 20 per cent of the population			1
celebrity backer : @entity85 has also intervened in the @entity7 election , saying @entity91 's ' whole agenda is to control @entity7			1
in this way , he can be friends with all of @entity7 ’s enemies			0
' @entity0 said monday there would be no @entity144 state if he were reelected			0
he 's pictured here giving a statement during his visit on monday to @entity147 , an @entity7 settlement in annexed east @entity69 @entity149 , head of the @entity150 , an alliance of four small @entity109 - backed parties , prepares to vote in @entity153 , @entity7 on tuesday			2
@entity7 are voting following a campaign largely focused on economic issues mr @entity0 , who is seeking a third consecutive term , has vowed he would never allow the @entity144 to establish a capital in the city 's eastern sector and pledged to build ' thousands ' of settler homes			1
he told public radio the two - state solution was now irrelevant , saying the ' reality has changed ' and ' any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical @entity165 '			0
the @entity144 want east @entity69 as capital of their future state , and continued settlement building has incensed the international community , which sees it as an obstacle to peace			0
throughout his campaign , mr @entity0 has repeatedly accused @entity122 leaders @entity174 and former peace negotiator @entity176 of being ready to abandon @entity7 's claim to @entity69 as its indivisible capital			1
mr @entity0 's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing @entity181 website if it was true that there would be no @entity144 state established if he was re-elected			2
' indeed , ' said mr @entity0 , who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side			0
mr @entity0 has based his campaign solidly on security issues , notably the @entity189 nuclear threat , giving short shrift to the focus on economic issues in centre - left campaigning			0
' if @entity176 and @entity195 set up the next government , @entity194 will be established on these hills here , ' he said in @entity147 , using the nickname of his key challenger , @entity201 leader mr @entity174			0
' @entity194 ' is a derogatory term used by @entity7 politicians to refer to the @entity204 , which has been ruled by @entity144 @entity206 movement @entity205 since 2007			0
mr @entity174 , meanwhile , has dismissed mr @entity0 's jibes			2
on sunday he pledged to ' safeguard ' @entity69 ' in actions , not just words , more than any other leader ' , and on monday insisted @entity69 would remain forever @entity7 's ' undivided capital '			1
former prime minister and @entity201 leader @entity213 came out in support of mr @entity174 , calling him ' experienced and responsible ' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure @entity7 's safety			1
the outgoing @entity7 parliament and the latest opinion poll showing who should end up with what @entity221 , attend his campaign meeting on monday in @entity223 in the @entity7 coastal city of @entity225 despite mr @entity0 's rhetoric , the @entity122 is tipped to come out on top in the election			1
final opinion polls published late last week put the @entity122 ahead with 25 - 26 seats with @entity0 's @entity121 taking 20 - 22 in the 120 - seat @entity231			2
the leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier - as in 2009 when the centrist @entity233 then headed by @entity176 effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought @entity0 to power for a second term			1
' in 2009 , ( @entity121 ) had a 100 - percent chance of forming a government while the leader of the largest party , @entity176 , had no chance whatsoever - and therefore she was not nominated , ' @entity245 said			0
under @entity7 's complex electoral system , the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes , but to the mp or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61 .			1

action hero says @entity0 is the ' strong leader ' @entity7 needs
intervention follows that of @entity88 's father @entity85
polling stations opened today for @entity7 's second snap general election
experts agree it 's likely to be a *referendum* on the @entity0 years
