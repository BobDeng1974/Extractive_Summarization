newly - single @entity0 made the headlines again this weekend , following reports that she has already found comfort in the arms of a new man			1
the tv star is said to be dating @entity7 , 30 , after meeting him on the set of a @entity10 advert last november			2
the @entity12 model is just latest in a long line of romances for @entity0 , 35 , who has jumped from relationship to relationship increasingly quickly over the past decade and a half			1
those closest to the brunette describe her as loyal , down - to - earth and largely unconcerned with the dazzling beauty that made her a household name			2
so why has such a good catch so far failed to find the love that she has been searching for ? @entity0 said herself of her failed relationship history recently : ' they 've all been on their a * * * s when i met them , they did n't have a career or they were at the end of one career and trying to start something else			1
' i met them all at a not very good time for them and that 's my fault for being nurturing , for being like @entity54			1
' they were all either in debt , or had no job , or they were figuring out what to do			0
' relationship expert @entity60 said : ' some people continually and repeatedly choose partners with problems			1
women are particularly good at playing rescuer ( a lost puppy brings out all those maternal , look - after - him instincts ) , but both sexes are guilty of it			0
' rescuers are attracted to people they can help			0
' they become saviours , putting their life completely on hold while they rescue their lover , cheerfully giving up work , friends and family to be at the beck and call of a person who often does n’t deserve such loyalty			0
' why the need to play doctor and shrink ? because rescuers truly believe that if they love enough , give enough and do enough , they ’ll save their lover from their problem			1
' you ’ve learnt to equate love with being needed			2
in order to feel loved you have to nurture and solve problems			0
' @entity95 looks back over @entity0 's past men , to see where she went wrong : @entity0 and action star @entity97 were childhood sweethearts and dated for seven years @entity97 1998 - 2004 : @entity0 started dating @entity97 when she was just 18 years old and he was 30			1
he spotted her while she was on a modelling job on the @entity101 island of @entity102 and later claimed it was love at first sight			2
at the time , @entity97 was making the big step from professional diver to @entity108 actor , via part - time model , after appearing in @entity111 's movie @entity110			1
the couple were so serious that they moved into a flat in @entity115 , south @entity116 , and later emigrated to @entity117 where they shared a house in @entity120			0
@entity97 was n't the only once to enjoy some career success - @entity0 also gained some small parts in television show @entity123 and the remake of @entity125			1
the couple were soon engaged to be married and were regularly referenced to as one of the strongest couples in showbusiness			0
but by 2004 , the relationship had hit the rocks and @entity0 dumped @entity97 , replacing him with the @entity108 actor @entity131			1
she said at the time : ' i was n't happy			0
i 'd been with @entity97 since i was very young and i knew i needed to branch out on my own			0
' it just so happened there was somebody else there , but it would have occurred anyway			0
' she claimed recently that @entity97 was on a break from his girlfriend @entity140 in 2013 , when she split with @entity141 , and he rang to tell her that he still loved her			0
she said : ' @entity97 called out of the blue and said , " i still love you so much , " and i said " i still love you			2
" we 'll always still love each other			2
' i know that for many years afterwards ( the split ) he was n't happy			0
' @entity0 and @entity117 actor @entity131 , who starred in @entity148 , were together for four years @entity131 2004 - 2008 : @entity0 wasted no time after her split from @entity97 , moving straight on to the @entity108 actor @entity131 , who was by then a global star thanks to his role in the @entity153 blockbuster @entity148			1
the couple appeared to be blissfully happy together for a few years and @entity131 proposed to his young girlfriend with a ring said to be worth £ 35,000			0
but the happiness was n't to last - in 2008 , the couple split and @entity0 moved back to the @entity159			1
at the time , the break - up was blamed on @entity0 's desire to spend more time in @entity159 , but in 2013 , she revealed that the actor was too controlling			1
she said : ' ( @entity163 ) wanted me either to look like a 1960s @entity166 girl or a 1950s housewife			0
that 's how he saw me			2
' i felt i had to find out who i was and what my own style was anyway , but it was controlling			2
' he projected all his fantasies on to me			0
i never had a real life with him			0
i was always in a fantasy fairy tale			0
' first time around , @entity0 and rugby player @entity141 dated for 22 months @entity141 2008 - 2010 : @entity0 did n't say single for long after her split from @entity131			1
no sooner had she moved back to the @entity159 than she was in the arms of @entity141 , then 20 , who at that time was a little - known rugby player for the @entity181			0
the couple had a tempestuous relationship that was rocked by rumours of infidelity and eventually ended 22 months later , when @entity141 relocated to @entity186 to try to resurrect his dwindling rugby career			1
unable to maintain her tv work down under , @entity0 stayed in the @entity159 and soon afterwards started dating @entity141 's friend @entity189			1
after @entity141 , @entity0 dated another rugby player , @entity189 , for two years @entity189 2010 - 2012 : @entity0 and @entity189 announced their relationship in december 2010 after dating in secret for a couple of months			1
he appeared to be a stable influence in @entity0 's life , who enjoyed nights at home instead of flashy film premieres and celebrity parties			1
the couple conceived a daughter in 2011 but sadly @entity0 suffered from a miscarriage			1
desperate to keep their relationship on track , @entity189 proposed and the couple tried for a second child but @entity0 miscarried once again			1
she told @entity210 last year : ' ( after the first miscarriage ) i went to see my doctor , who said , " the best way to get over this is to try and get pregnant again			0
" ' so @entity189 and i were n't careful , and just before christmas 2011 , i got pregnant again			0
' the look on @entity189 's face said it all			2
i think he was terrified ... i had another miscarriage after a few weeks			0
' the couple were unable to overcome the second tragedy though and split in 2012			0
@entity0 and @entity141 's second attempt at a relationship lasted just seven months @entity141 2013 : just a few weeks after @entity0 split with @entity189 , she re-started her relationship with @entity141 , who was by then back in the @entity159 with the @entity226 - based club @entity225			1
the couple dated for seven months , regularly posting affectionate pictures of themselves in exotic locations , before splitting in august 2013 , following reports that @entity141 had cheated on @entity0			1
she said afterwards of the relationship : ' he was n't funny or intelligent			2
' his only chat up line was " you 're the one			0
i 've never felt like this			0
i want to have your babies			0
" ' except two weeks later he 's saying it to the next one			2
' @entity0 started dating @entity239 , a.k.a @entity240 , last january @entity239 2014 : @entity0 started dating @entity239 , aka @entity240 , last january after meeting him at a @entity243 's party in her @entity116 bar , @entity245			1
just 12 weeks later , the model announced on @entity247 that the bodybuilder had proposed - and she had accepted			2
but just as soon as their relationship started , it was over			2
the couple split in september following reports that @entity239 had cheated on her with his former girlfriend @entity254 behind her back			1
after some serious wooing by @entity239 , @entity0 relented and they dated again for another couple of months , before splitting again in november following more allegations of cheating			1
she said at the time : ' maybe it ’s not my time to find love at the moment			1
i just get to focus on myself			0
there are more important things in the world			0

model @entity0 , 35 , has struggled to find lasting love
her most recent relationship with @entity239 lasted just 10 months
