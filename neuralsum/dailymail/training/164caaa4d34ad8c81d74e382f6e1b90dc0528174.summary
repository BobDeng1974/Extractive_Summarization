everything was in place for @entity2 to suffer another embarrassment to begin their new era in the cold and wet of @entity6 on friday but they did all they had to do to take one small step towards recovery from their winter horrors			0
it would have been easy for @entity2 to push for an abandonment to avoid any chance of more suffering when rain delayed a fixture that was always likely to be weather - affected			2
yet one thing they will not lack under @entity19 is enthusiasm and they made sure the 6,000 crowd who had waited all day at least got something of a game , even batting on during heavy rain when play eventually got under way at 4pm			0
job done : @entity29 took four wickets as @entity2 beat @entity31 by 39 runs in @entity6 ‘ it would have been wrong if the game had n’t taken place , ’ said @entity2 captain @entity33			1
‘ it was as wet as i ’ve ever fielded in and it probably was n’t fit to play but both sides got on with it			0
’ @entity2 wore a strip that was virtually orange in their ill - fated @entity44 match against @entity45 and now , seemingly with a nod to their hosts , they took to the @entity49 outfield in near identical blue to @entity31			2
the chances of their faces becoming red were increased when rain reduced the match to 23 and then 20 overs after @entity31 had won what looked an important toss			1
yet @entity2 , who will meet @entity31 in different circumstances at next year ’s @entity62 , encouragingly passed this test of their mettle			0
glum : @entity19 and @entity33 watch on as rain delays the start of the game in @entity6 fresh start : @entity33 and @entity70 come out to open the innings for @entity2 @entity2 would not usually entrust the start of a @entity44 innings to @entity33 and @entity70 and the longer - form openers had to work hard for their runs in the gloom and in the face of what @entity33 hailed as ‘ outstanding ’ @entity80 fielding			1
@entity70 was added to @entity2 ’s squad for their @entity44 matches against @entity82 in march and the world tournament without playing a game but here he showed that class usually prevails across all forms of the game			0
while @entity33 had trouble timing his strokes , @entity70 raced to 50 off 34 balls with two sixes and it will be interesting to see whether @entity2 include him for the sole short - form match against @entity44 champions @entity94 for the match at the @entity97 on may 20			1
@entity70 ’s launchpad would have led to a bigger @entity2 score than their eventual 167 for six had their attempts to accelerate not been punctured by outstanding catches which accounted for @entity33 , @entity103 and @entity104			2
contribution : the @entity2 captain scored 44 before being dismissed by @entity107 half - century : @entity70 scored 50 to help @entity2 along to 167 from their 20 overs @entity110 ’s @entity109 , one of six county players in the @entity31 side , was the pick of the home bowlers with three prime wickets but @entity2 , so woeful with the bat in the winter , will be satisfied with this opening gambit			1
once @entity119 had struck in the first over @entity2 ’s latest banana skin was close to being avoided and @entity31 fell 40 short of their revised target of 173 despite some fine hitting from @entity123 , who has given up his job in an @entity6 bank to concentrate of cricket			2
another couple of overs of @entity123 , who hit 42 off 16 balls , and things could have been very different but @entity119 took a fine catch in the deep to give @entity29 one of his four victims			0
this does not mean @entity2 are back but at least it ’s a start			0
leap : @entity107 catches @entity103 on the boundary to dismiss the @entity2 batsman for nine strike : @entity119 struck twice early to dismiss @entity141 and @entity142 ( above ) emerging talent : @entity2 's @entity144 runs in to bowl at @entity146 scene : the rain during the early part of the day cleared up , allowing the teams to play a 20 - over contest low five : @entity29 celebrates with @entity152 after picking up one of his four wickets through the gate : @entity31 's @entity156 is clean bowled in @entity6 watching on : spectators in attendance for the one - day international in @entity6			1

@entity2 scored 167 - 7 in their 20 overs of rain - reduced match
@entity33 made 44 as fellow opener @entity70 scored 50
@entity31 closed on *133* - 9 in chase of @entity167 / @entity165 *adjusted* 173 target
@entity29 took four wickets for @entity2 to restrict @entity31
@entity19 ' second reign as @entity2 coach began with a victory
