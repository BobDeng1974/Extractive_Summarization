every saturday night , we can expect the same , soggy @entity2 weather forecast			2
a hurricane of hurt , closely followed by a tear - nado ripping across @entity7 ’s carefully applied make - up , causing widespread disruption of her mascara			1
yes , there will be the occasional showers in the vicinity of @entity13 sometimes even @entity14 looks a bit damp near coastal areas — and @entity17 certainly seems slightly overcast when he reads the latest viewing figures			0
yet the full - scale flooding alert remains in place only over @entity21 , with further tears expected to fall on already saturated ground and the prospect of even more to come at the judges ’ houses stage this weekend			1
for the returning @entity52 judge , much of this series of the @entity50 has been a three - hankie weepie , a two - tissue sobfest , a one - woman show of emotion in a never - ending ugly bug bawl			0
it is understandable if the poor contestants , especially the rejects , burst into tears while holding their head in their hands , moaning softly			1
but why - oh - why , particularly given how much she gets paid , should @entity7 be so distraught ? yet since the first episode of this series , the newly - married 31 - year - old has been weeping like an open wound			1
by now , we all know the warning signs that signal a @entity7 sob storm is imminent			1
the wobbly lip and chin			0
the promise to some poor , warbling misfit that they are ‘ just my cuppa tea ’			2
that photogenic , misty look into the middle distance			0
episode three : @entity79 sings a syrupy self - penned tribute to her little sister , reminding @entity7 that she also has a sister and ( right ) @entity7 reaches for the tissues during @entity85 's performance during episode four and then the brimming eyes as @entity7 realises that the auditionee reminds @entity7 ; of a time when @entity7 herself was a struggling @entity7 and not the millionaire - popstar , professional - mime - artiste and flogger - of - hairspray - and - perfumes @entity7 that she is today			1
blub ! she ’s like sequined semtex			0
anything can set her off			2
in the very first episode , @entity7 was weeping as she hugged a contestant she had briefly met years ago			1
this seemed an unlikely wellspring of emotion , but never mind			0
a silvery teardrop trickled down her face , like a rivulet of ice melt inching down a beige glacier			0
at her side , @entity13 went to pieces during an audition by @entity109 , expertly flicking away her tears with windscreen wiper fingers			2
a week later , @entity7 is squeezing out some salty ones over @entity79 ’s performance			1
why ? because @entity79 sang a song she had written about her sister — and this reminds our @entity28 of her own little sister , who apparently writes her poems , too			0
episode five : comeback queen and @entity121 girl @entity36 gets @entity7 's vote , but no one else is impressed episode nine : time to pick who goes through to the judges ' house round and the pressure is on this time it ’s double bubble : twin tracks from both eyes as our girl manages to somehow look stricken yet devout , like a nun who realises she has forgotten to wear her underpinnings to mass. look at @entity136 of the @entity137 , @entity138 of @entity139 ! oh , it ’s all getting too much			1
in episode five , she is welling up again as @entity36 sings the @entity144 classic , @entity145			2
what ’s heated her gravy up this time ? perhaps someone has just told her that @entity149 ’s mother really did die , and she ’s struggling to cope with that news in a very flattering , soft focus kind of way			0
last weekend , the return of @entity79 threw @entity7 into yet another tizzy			1
in this episode , she puts her hands over her damp eyes so often , cynics wonder if she ’s just using her emotion as an excuse to flash her ginormous engagement ring			2
stranger things have happened at sea			0
speaking of which , the following night , @entity7 hoists the howling mainsail and climbs aboard the good ship @entity167 on her biggest voyage of tears to date			1
what on earth has happened now ? has somebody died ? even worse , has @entity17 cut her @entity174 bonus ? no. a young man from @entity176 called @entity29 is wearing tragically turned - up jeans , bearing his patterned socks to the world			0
that ’s enough to do it			0
screaming blubs ! ! he is also singing rather nicely , which is what one would hope for in a singing contest , but somehow , this tips @entity7 into full diamond - ring - flashing , wrist - buckling meltdown , with @entity13 joining in on sobby backing vocals			2
later , in the arena auditions , a singer called @entity194 makes @entity13 have a deep weep , while an unusually dry - eyed @entity7 jokes to the bewildered singer that she ‘ made @entity197 ’			1
people cry for different reasons			0
we cry because we feel sad and bad , we cry for all the suffering in the world , we cry because sometimes it ’s the only human response that seems appropriate			2
@entity7 ’s showbiz tears only serve to dilute real emotion and if she is like this with this @entity211 of nobodies , what is she going to be like during the live finals ? meanwhile , the terrible news is that she has forecast stormy squalls of tears tonight			1
in the past , @entity7 has said the judges ’ houses stage , where she personally has to tell her hand - picked contestants that their x factor journey is over and send them home , is the most emotionally wrenching of all			1
for her , not them			0
@entity225 aloft , you have been warned .			0

@entity21 seems to burst into tears during every episode
she cries when contestants are good and bad , anything can set her off
in the first episode @entity7 wept as she hugged a hopeful she met years ago
more tears are expected at the judges ’ houses stage this weekend
