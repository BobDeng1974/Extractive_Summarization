by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 11:00 est , 2 january 2014 a teenager with severe curvature of the spine has improved dramatically despite being told she might never stand up straight again			2
@entity5 , 15 , was diagnosed with scoliosis three years ago after her @entity8 teacher noticed her shoulder was sticking out on one side			1
the keen tennis player was diagnosed with a severe curvature of the spine and surgery was recommended as the only option to help her recover			1
@entity5 was diagnosed with severe curvature of the spine - or scoliosis - three years ago and was told she would need major spinal surgery to place metal rods in her back had she opted for surgery she would have had metal rods inserted into her back , before having her spine fused			1
but frustrated with the lack of options and terrified of what the future could hold for her daughter , @entity5 ’s mother , @entity28 , investigated alternative treatments , before eventually discovering the @entity32 clinic in @entity33			1
set up more than seven years ago by @entity35 , a former scoliosis patient , the clinic has helped hundreds of sufferers through the problem by teaching them exercises which improve their posture			1
the exercises vary depending on the severity of the condition			0
within a week of starting an intensive four - week treatment course , @entity5 started to notice a difference , with less pain across her back and an improvement in her breathing capacity			1
@entity5 , from @entity48 , said : ‘ when i was told that i had scoliosis , i did n’t really understand to start with			1
‘ no one ever sat me down and explained what was going on in my back until i got to the @entity32 clinic			0
instead of the operation , @entity5 opted to take part in a four week exercise programme in @entity33 and she is now pain free and able to return to playing tennis ‘ the staff at the @entity32 clinic were amazing , they made me feel normal again			1
‘ they also encouraged me to carry on living a normal life when all of the specialists at the hospital were telling me that i needed to be careful and not put too much pressure on my body by doing too much sport			0
‘ the exercises were n’t hard - you just had to think about what you were doing			2
‘ i am the sort of person to put 100 per cent into everything i do and i believe that ’s why i got such good results			0
i can not wait to get back to playing tennis			0
’ @entity5 , together with her family are now working to raise awareness of scoliosis and the alternatives to surgery			1
scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an s - shape			1
signs include a visible curve in the spine , one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other , clothes not hanging properly and back pain			2
@entity95 usually only affects adults with the condition			0
in most cases , the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy			2
in the @entity104 , scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000			0
it is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis			0
it is more common in women than in men			0
most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows			0
however , in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing			0
occasionally , a child needs surgery to straighten their spine			2
in adults , it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain			2

@entity5 , 15 , was diagnosed with scoliosis three years ago
doctors recommended she have surgery to place rods in her spine
because of the risks of the surgery she *decided* to take part in a four week exercise programme in @entity33 instead - she is now free of pain
