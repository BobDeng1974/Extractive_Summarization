by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 21:14 est , 13 december 2013 winners : @entity2 , 55 , and @entity3 , 48 , celebrate winning £ 6,676,215 last year when @entity2 and @entity5 won £ 6.6million on the lottery , they could have bought fancy cars or wardrobes full of designer clothes			1
but the couple simply ca n’t shake their thrifty ways and call being rich ‘ a headache ’			2
they still buy their clothes from markets and charity shops – a £ 6 skirt and £ 2 jumper are recent bargains – and scour car boot sales			0
and they ’ll stick to their usual £ 50 limit on @entity25 gifts			1
mr @entity2 is giving his wife four new tyres on her car , saying : ‘ i got them at a discount			1
’ mrs @entity5 , 48 , said : ‘ i ca n’t change my habits			1
my friend took me to @entity33 in @entity34 and i nearly passed out at the prices			0
’ her recent purchases have included buying herself a new skirt - costing £ 6 from the local market - and jumpers for her husband from the same place are usually priced £ 2			0
while he bought her a £ 3 pair of second hand shoes from a charity shop , although they had caught his eye because they were the same style as the ones she wore on their first date			0
the divorcees have five children between them from previous relationships and 13 grandchildren			0
they lived together in @entity58 , @entity59 , for years and mr @entity2 , 56 , finally plucked up the courage to propose shortly after hitting the jackpot last august			1
with their newly - won riches the couple could have chosen an exotic location anywhere in the world to tie the knot , but true to form they went for the simple option			2
the @entity70 ceremony took place at @entity72 and was attended only by immediate family			2
mrs @entity5 even saved money by wearing a dress borrowed from a friend and mr @entity2 wore a suit several years old			1
they now have the money to buy a fleet of cars , but she drives a two - year - old @entity82 and he has a five - year - old @entity84			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ people keep asking me if i am going to get a @entity86 or a @entity87 , but what would be the point			1
we just want to be comfortable , we are so used to living within our means			0
’ spend : they refuse to splurge on @entity25 presents or their wedding , preferring their normal lifestyle commenting on becoming multi-millionaires , he added ; ‘ it is a headache			1
the money generates a whole new avenue of problems			0
we have a solicitor and a financial advisor and we have regular meetings but at the moment it is just sitting in the bank			0
’ the couple previously had a joint income of around £ 50,000 , but could only afford to rent their home			0
that has now changed and the one exception to their refusal to splash the cash on themselves has been in buying a house			0
they are having a three - bedroom bungalow built for them to live with mrs @entity5 ’s parents			1
her 72 - year - old father @entity125 is in the late stages of @entity127 after suffering from it for a decade and her mother @entity129 is recovering from cancer and has severe arthritis			0
they hope one day to start a business , but the win has enabled mrs @entity5 and her husband to quit their jobs to become carers			1
‘ @entity5 is determined to look after her parents herself and the easiest way to support her in doing that is to move in with them , ’ he said			1
the couple have also fulfilled an ambition to buy each of their children a house as well			0
however , with @entity25 approaching they have n’t changed their customary budget for presents of £ 50 per person in the family			1
and mr @entity2 does n’t have to worry about what to get his wife because he ’s already spent money on her			2
‘ i have put four new tyres on @entity5 ’s car , ’ he said			2
‘ i got them at a discount			0

@entity2 , 55 , and @entity5 , 48 , said they can not handle *expensive* shopping and prefer to live the way they did before their win last august
they got married this year in @entity169 , @entity59
the couple have told family not to expect *lavish* @entity25 presents
