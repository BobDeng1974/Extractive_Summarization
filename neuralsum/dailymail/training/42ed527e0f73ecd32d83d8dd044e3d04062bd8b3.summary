the jockey , from @entity32 , @entity33 , but now living at @entity34 , @entity35 , admitted drink driving on march 16			0
@entity37 , prosecuting , told the court that around 5am on march 16 a man driving home from a night shift spotted @entity5 ' either asleep or looking down at his mobile phone ' with his car parked in the carriageway of @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47			1
the ' concerned ' driver went back and saw another vehicle parked behind @entity5 's @entity2 and a young man asking the jockey if he had been drinking			2
@entity5 then drove off but his registration number was taken			2

@entity5 gave a reading of 84 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath			2
the legal limit is 35mg			0
mr @entity8 , mitigating , said a number of ' trigger events ' prompted an episode of sleep - walking that led @entity5 , a man of no previous convictions and ' exemplary character ' to get in the car			1
he said @entity5 used to ride for sir @entity77 , who had recently died , an ex-girlfriend had committed suicide and he had suffered the break - up of a long term relationship			2

@entity5 initally claimed he had not been drinking , then ' rolled ' out of a police car and lay down on the ground mr @entity8 told the court : ' the thrust of my mitigation is he 's completely unaware of what he 's doing			1
he 's sleep - driving			0
' the defendant 's next recollection is actually being in the back of a police vehicle			0
' mr @entity8 added that there was a history of sleep - walking in @entity5 's family - and the defendant had sleep - walked from the age of five			1
but he had never ' sleep - driven ' before , which happened due to these ' trigger events '			0
mr @entity8 said the law did not allow him to argue ' special reasons ' and the defendant pleaded not guilty on the basis of sleep - walking while drink driving			2
he added : ' i do n't think the law has kept up with scientific developments , because it seems simply unfair for a man of this quality now to have a criminal conviction for something which in my view , he 's morally totally innocent			0
it would seem to fly in the face of natural justice			0
' @entity5 leaves @entity127 accompanied by his celebrity solicitor @entity128 dr @entity129 , a consultant psychiatrist called by the defence to give evidence , told the court he had twice examined the defendant			1
dr @entity129 said it was possible @entity5 was unaware of his actions because of his sleep - walking			0
' it is an automatic state , like a trance state , where there 's no control of it , ' he said			0
after listening to the defence mitigation , district judge @entity143 said previous legal authorities had ruled sleep - walking was not a defence for drink driving			0

@entity5 told the court he will pay within seven days			2
outside court mr @entity8 said : ' because drink driving is a crime that does n't require any specific intent , he ca n't argue this as a defence or a special reason			2
' the law needs to be changed to reflect this unique set of circumstances			0
