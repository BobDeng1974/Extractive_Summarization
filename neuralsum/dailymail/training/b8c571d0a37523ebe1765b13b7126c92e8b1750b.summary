by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:40 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:40 est , 18 december 2013 authorities across the @entity4 have decreed that the @entity6 term ' sexting ' is to be henceforth known in @entity7 as ' textopornographie '			1
@entity8 made its pronouncement earlier this month , ruling also that the imported gerund 's associated noun , ' sext ' , must to @entity7 speakers become ' texto pornographique '			2
and if that 's a bit of a mouthful for heavy breathing @entity7 lovers the @entity17 has also suggested a ready - made contraction , ' sexto '			1
' @entity19 ! @entity20 ! ' sexting , or textopornographie , is the act of sending sexually explicit messages and photographs , usually between mobile phones , that has become popular with the rise of portable technology the decision came among a wave of rulings that proposed new @entity7 terms for ' prenuptial agreement ' , ' happy slapping ' and ' child grooming '			1
@entity8 , which is @entity34 's linguistic watchdog , has been fighting a long war against the infiltration of @entity6 terms and idioms , advising countrymen to replace such words as ' le weekend ' with ' @entity41 ' and so on			1
but their latest fightback against the @entity45 invasion is to coin a new term for something you might have expected speakers of the language of love to invent in the first place			0
sexting is the act of sending sexually explicit messages and photographs , usually between mobile phones			0
the @entity6 term , a portmanteau of sex and texting , first rose to popularity in the early 21st century			0
as the spread of technology encouraged the risque practice around the world , many languages adopted the word too			0
but @entity34 's authorities have now decided to crack down on its usage			0
technology has proved a potent trojan horse for smuggling @entity6 words into @entity7 , previously spurring authorities to invent new terms for email ( courriel ) , software ( logiciel ) and walkman ( baladeur )			1
last year , they famously ruled that the @entity80 - inspired term ' hashtag ' be replaced with the more elegantly @entity7 version ' mot - dièse ' @entity8 was founded in 1635 by @entity84 , then chief minister to @entity86 the xiii , as the preeminent authority on matters pertaining to the @entity7 language			1
according its founding documents , the role of the @entity17 is to ' to labour with all the care and diligence possible , to give exact rules to our language , to render it capable of treating the arts and sciences			0
' its 40 members , elected for life by other members of the @entity17 , are known as immortels and wear an elaborate @entity106 uniform of long , black coats and black - feathered cocked hats richly embroidered with leafy green motifs			0
@entity34 , which houses l ¿ académie française : @entity34 's linguistic watchdog has been fighting a long war against the infiltration of @entity6 idioms , including such words as ' le weekend ' , ' le podcast ' and ' chat ' the @entity17 's general commission on terminology and @entity118 made its pronouncement on sexting in a communique published on december 5			2
other @entity6 words and terms given a @entity124 reinterpretation included ' child pornography ' , which is now ' pédopornographie ' ; ' child grooming ' , which became ' pédopiégeage ' ; ' happy slapping ' , which was given the more appropriate - sounding description ' vidéoagression ' ; and ' prenuptial agreement ' is now ' accord prénuptial '			1
the @entity7 government commissioned a report into @entity6 usage three years ago , which warned that the global domination of @entity136 culture had plunged the future of the @entity7 language into a ' deep crisis '			1
the report said : ' @entity6 - speakers have a vision of the so - called @entity6 - speaking world , but an equivalent concept does not seem to exist in @entity34			2
' despite having 200million @entity7 - speakers on @entity147 , the idea of a @entity7 - speaking world is becoming obsolete			2
' @entity34 is failing to promote its own language , and there seems to be very little interest in doing so			0

authorities propose *string* of @entity7 versions of often - used @entity6 words
other translated terms include ' prenuptial agreement ' and ' happy slap '
