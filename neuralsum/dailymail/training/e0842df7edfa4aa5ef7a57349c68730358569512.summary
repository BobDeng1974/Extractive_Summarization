@entity15 ' tragic suicide brought international attention to her claims that she was gang - raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by classmates who called her a ' slut ' and harassed her for sex			1

one is accused of taking the picture , both are accused of circulating it			0

death threats : since @entity15 , 17 , killed herself in april , her father , @entity40 , pictured , has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in her case ' victim ' : @entity15 , pictured , was labelled a ' slut ' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010 protection : the two teenage suspects , now 18 , can not be identified under @entity21 law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place @entity15 's heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying and torment at school			1

' no help ' : @entity120 staff failed to speak to the boys involved and @entity15 left @entity15 eventually closed down her @entity6 page because there were so many men asking her to have sex with them			2
they would say : ‘ you had sex with my friend , so why not me ? ’ the response from the school was , apparently , to do very little			0
@entity132 school board spokesman @entity131 has said that none of the boys were spoken to			0
@entity15 's death prompted the @entity137 government to launch reviews of the @entity140 's original investigation and the school board 's handling of the matter			2
an independent review released in june concluded the @entity145 could have done a better job , but it was hindered by the fact that @entity15 was often absent from class .			2

she told her mother she was gang - raped two years before and taunted about it after classmates saw a picture of the assault
