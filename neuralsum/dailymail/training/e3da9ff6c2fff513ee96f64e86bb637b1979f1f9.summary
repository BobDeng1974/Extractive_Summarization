by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 time to get tough : prime minister @entity3 and his wife @entity4 senior @entity5 say @entity3 should commit to backing an exit from the @entity7 if he fails to negotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship with @entity9			1
voters may not be convinced by his pledge of an in / out referendum by 2017 unless he toughens his stance , they say			1
after @entity17 's advances in local and @entity19 elections , @entity15 also say victory in next week 's by - election in @entity22 is vital to burst the @entity24 bubble			1
mr @entity3 said the message from voters had been ' absolutely received and understood '			0
he said : ' people are deeply disillusioned with the @entity7 , they do n't feel that the current arrangements are working well enough for @entity30			0
' what we need to do is demonstrate we are the ones with the plan to sort out this relationship and give people the choice – in or out			0
' the @entity5 ' @entity37 election results were not as bad as feared , however			1
many were taken aback to find their party came close to beating @entity40 into second place in polls voters often use to punish governing parties			1
in some regions , such as the @entity47 , the @entity45 vote was almost the same as in 2009 , at the height of @entity51 's unpopularity			0
however , the figures suggest the party will struggle to gain a majority at a general election even if it is the largest single group – raising the prospect of another coalition			1
a source close to the @entity59 of @entity5 said : ' there 's no need for seismic change			2
but the problem is these results confirm where we thought we were : cruising for a messy result next year			0
' obviously holding @entity22 is important , but the big message from the results is about the lack of trust in politics ... do people really believe there is actually going to be a referendum ? ' @entity45 mp @entity75 said an outright win was a ' tall order ' , and @entity3 's pledge to hold an in / out referendum on @entity80 had not ' shot the [ @entity24 ] fox '			1
' @entity24 present themselves as a party that wants to break down compromises they see in ... the @entity87 village , ' he said			1
' the truth is there 's more to choose between the conservatives and @entity40 than there has been in the last 25 years			0
' they will demand he brings forward the referendum and sets out his plans for renegotiating relations with the @entity7 , he said			0
senior @entity5 , such as business minister @entity111 , urged mr @entity3 to say he would back leaving the @entity7 if he could not arrange a favourable deal			1
worryingly for conservatives , the @entity19 results put @entity24 ahead in some parts of @entity22 , site of next thursday 's by - election triggered by the resignation of disgraced mp @entity118			1
mr @entity3 has already made two campaign visits to the area			0
one @entity45 mp said a failure to listen to voters could cost them the seat			0
seismic : @entity24 's @entity126 celebrating after being elected as a @entity127 on sunday he added : ' everyone says they 've heard the voters ' anger ... but then the usual cliche - laden , soft - left social democratic politics carries on as before			1
i 'm not sure that 's going to win it for us in @entity22			2
' @entity45 @entity138 said he was ' confident ' of victory , but called for a deal with @entity24			1
he said : ' personally , i 'd take @entity3 and @entity17 and lock them in a room , and not let them out until they 've reached an agreement			0
' the prime minister rejected calls to back an @entity7 exit , saying other member countries are also keen on reform			0
' i am confident of a good renegotiation , ' he said			0
he said he will not countenance ' pacts or deals ' with @entity24			2
' conservative candidates will stand as conservatives , fight as conservatives and i hope win as conservatives , ' he added			0
@entity159 , the @entity160 president , and a champion of the @entity7 , said that the @entity7 must reform and scale back			0
he said the @entity7 had become too ' remote and incomprehensible '			0
' @entity80 has to be simple , clear , to be effective where it is needed and to withdraw from where it is not necessary , ' he said			0
by @entity166 @entity167 @entity24 leader @entity17 poses for photographers at a pub ahead of a press conference in central @entity171 yesterday even after the @entity45 ’s most humiliating performance in a national election since 1906 , @entity3 was still in denial yesterday about why he and the @entity5 are so unpopular			1
although he said he accepts that ‘ people are deeply disillusioned with the @entity7 ’ , none of the other messages that great swathes of @entity30 sent to the government — and indeed @entity40 — by voting so heavily for @entity24 have been understood			2
certainly people are cheesed off with the anti-democratic , elitist and corrupt @entity180 that the @entity7 has become			0
but they are also angry and frustrated that mr @entity3 has , for many years , mostly responded to such demands with talk rather than action			0
while he has outlined plans to restrict immigration and to limit access by new immigrants to welfare benefits and public services , the problem becomes worse daily			0
while the prime minister and his colleagues have indulged in rhetoric , tens of thousands of people from @entity80 have poured into @entity30 — leaving our own citizens with the feeling that the government could n’t care less about their prosperity , their aspirations and their investment in the country			0
this is compounded by the fact that mr @entity3 seems unable to understand — or refuses to admit — that @entity24 also champions policies that voters once found in the older , establishment parties but which the @entity210 - educated , metropolitan elite who now run them find unpalatable			1
between them , @entity24 and the @entity5 got nearly 52 per cent of the vote in the @entity19 elections , confirming that there is a right - of - centre majority in this country			1
mr @entity3 ’s dilemma is how to unite these conservative forces and prevent @entity220 becoming prime minister next year by default			0
while this seems to be a challenge that is being ducked by leading @entity5 such as @entity227 , who parroted the line that the @entity45 party does n’t do pacts , in fact it has had to in the past and can do again			1
a number of @entity15 and @entity127 — led by @entity233 and including @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity138 — have said publicly that the @entity5 and @entity24 must come to an accommodation			1
principles are one thing : but the point of being in politics is to have power , and power is haemorrhaging away from the @entity5 otherwise			2
compromise : a number of @entity15 and @entity127 ¿ led by @entity233 and including @entity234 ( pictured ) , @entity235 and @entity245 have said publicly that the @entity5 and @entity24 must come to an accommodation			1
although no member of the @entity248 is prepared to countenance such a possibility yet , some junior ministers ( as well as numerous backbench @entity45 mps worried about losing their seats next year ) would find it easy to strike some deal with @entity24			2
despite mr @entity3 ’s antipathy , it would be straightforward for @entity45 parliamentary candidates to be allowed to begin discussions with @entity24 at a local level			2
it is highly unlikely that a sitting mp is going to give up his seat for a @entity24 candidate			2
however , in constituencies such as @entity266 , in @entity267 , where @entity17 has been tipped to stand and the incumbent @entity45 mp is standing down , there is nothing to be gained by putting up a novice @entity45 candidate against him when he could quite likely win the seat without having his vote split by the @entity45			0
there will be other seats where @entity5 might choose not to field a candidate and where @entity24 is strong			1
in return , @entity24 could decide not to fight seats where a @entity45 incumbent stands the best chance of defeating @entity40			2
similar deals were made when @entity281 ’s @entity5 formed an alliance with the @entity283 in 1951			2
in any case , many @entity24 activists used to be @entity45 activists			2
negotiations ought not to prove difficult			0
for his part , @entity17 has always been open - minded about a deal , though reluctant to do one with mr @entity3 because of the toxic image the @entity118 has among most @entity24 supporters			1
i suspect he might feel able to change his party ’s mind on that if there were advantages for @entity24 , such as posts for his team in a @entity45 / @entity24 government			1
@entity24 would hope to see some movement within the @entity45 party on policies other than @entity80 , notably on public spending and education			1
but there are many @entity45 mps , too , who wish their leadership would ditch its opposition to grammar schools and its £ 10 billion - a - year overseas aid programme			0
@entity24 has a clear idea of where it can win seats			2
it will shortly embark on a fundraising drive to help its general election campaign and it hopes this week ’s success will bring money flooding in , as well as attracting new activists			1
if the @entity5 have any sense , they will start talking about such an arrangement now			0
for if , next week , @entity24 wins the @entity22 by - election and the @entity5 descend into panic , @entity3 might find himself with no other option .			1

voters may not be swayed by in / out referendum promise , say senior @entity5
conservatives need a victory in @entity22 by - election to halt @entity24 advance
the party is facing another coalition even if it triumphs in general election
