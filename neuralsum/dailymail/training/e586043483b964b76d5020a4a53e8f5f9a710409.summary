by @entity0 incoming @entity2 boss @entity1 will receive a pay and perks package worth up to £ 3.7m when he begins bills are to be reduced by £ 12 a year on average after new price controls were agreed by five of the six companies that run @entity9 ’s electricity network			1
regulator @entity10 said the cut has been driven by £ 2.1billion of savings it has secured from the companies ’ business plans since last year			1
the distribution part of the energy bill - which accounts for 8 % of an annual dual fuel bill - will be on average £ 12 a year lower than it is today from 2015 - 2023			1
however , the incoming chief executive of @entity2 - which owns @entity2 - is in line for a welcoming pay and perks package worth up to £ 3.7million when he begins his tenure as boss on january 1			1
it comes as his predecessor and current @entity2 chief executive @entity28 is expected to leave with a bundle worth up to £ 4 million			2
critics yesterday branded @entity28 's sum ‘ a reward for failure ’			1
his tenure has seen household energy prices increase by more than inflation every year			1
the average dual fuel bill now stands at almost £ 1,300 a year , compared to £ 600 when he joined in 2006			1
his successor , former @entity40 executive @entity1 , will walk into a £ 925,000 salary when he takes up his new role , alongside up to £ 2.7m in perks and bonuses			2
the exorbitant salary and welcoming package comes at a time when many families are struggling to pay their energy bills and have been branded as ' insulting '			1
@entity51 mp @entity50 said : ‘ the name @entity1 is about right – he is conning the public with this insulting salary			0
‘ his base salary alone is thirty - five times the average salary and would pay the electricity bill of over seven hundred people			0
‘ mr @entity1 has said he will rebuild trust into the sector			0
he certainly has not got off to a good start , and is instead living up to his name			0
’ @entity2 yesterday said mr @entity28 would not receive 12 months ’ pay when he leaves			2
@entity28 will leave @entity2 with pay and perks package worth up to £ 4million at the end of the year but he will get to keep interests in hundreds of thousands of company shares under a host of lucrative rewards schemes			1
these will pay out to him if the group hits performance targets in the coming years – even though he will no longer be at the firm			0
he bowed to public pressure earlier this year by offering to donate his £ 851,000 bonus to charity – but sparked outrage by accepting a lucrative share scheme worth up to £ 2million just days later			2
he also holds shares in the company worth more than £ 6million , built up over almost a decade ’s service at the group			0
last november , @entity83 was the only company to have its prices agreed early after @entity10 judged its business plan for the eight - year period showed sufficient value for consumers			0
@entity10 returned five out of the six companies ' plans - @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 - because they failed to deliver value for consumers			0
since then , companies have identified £ 700 million of savings and @entity10 has ruled out a further £ 1.4billion following further analysis			0
@entity94 said it was disappointed with a number of elements within the draft determination , including @entity10 's assumptions about the scope of further cost reductions across the industry .			0
