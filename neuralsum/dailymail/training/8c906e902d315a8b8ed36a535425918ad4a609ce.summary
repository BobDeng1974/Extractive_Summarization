the hand of friendship extended down the paddock on thursday , one @entity3 to another — world champion to world champion — when @entity6 told @entity7 they do not need a new driver but a new car			1
it was some kind of balm to @entity12 as he sat in @entity13 , the place where he once spent the happiest moment of his life — hugging his father after winning the title in 2009 — but now contemplating the end of his @entity21 career			1
@entity12 is about to be released by @entity7 to be replaced by @entity22 after the final race in @entity24 in a fortnight , hence he can hardly understand it , having outscored his team - mate @entity27 94 - 53			1
@entity12 is all smiles as he speaks with members of the media ahead of the @entity32 @entity31 @entity6 won the @entity33 @entity31 with ease last week and looks set to win the drivers ' championship but @entity37 , @entity7 ’s racing director , wants a blend of youth — @entity27 is 22 — and experience			1
@entity22 is 34 and a double world champion			1
@entity6 , who spent three years with @entity12 as @entity7 team - mates , was equally astonished by the news			1
he said : ‘ @entity44 going ? really ? surely @entity12 can go anywhere ? @entity12 is better than most of the drivers			1
' he ’s a great driver			0
he ’s had an amazing career and he ’s still one of the strongest drivers here , so it does n’t correlate			2
if i had a team , i would want him in it			2
he ’s a great asset			0
‘ he ’s smart and fast			0
he ’s also just a decent guy			0
he ’s still got plenty of time as a driver to keep racing and winning			0
@entity6 has backed @entity12 to remain at @entity7 and says they should change the car rather than him ‘ he just needs to be given a better car			1
it ’s not that the team need a better driver			2
there are not many out there			0
’ the two men are not bosom friends and @entity12 has had cause to be annoyed by @entity6 ’s erratic behaviour in the past , but there is mutual respect between them as racers			1
will @entity6 ’s endorsement change anyone ’s mind at @entity7 ? even if it did , would @entity12 want to stay ? ‘ i ca n’t answer that question , ’ said @entity12 , hinting at an irrevocable breakdown in relations with the team			1
‘ when you ’re put in a position that many drivers have been put in over the years it opens your eyes to different challenges , whether it ’s racing , doing another sport or something altogether different			2
@entity6 says @entity12 is better than most of the drivers on the circuit and could still go anywhere ‘ i ’m excited about the challenges ahead			1
i have a lot of different ideas			0
‘ @entity21 and motor racing have been a massive part of my life and it ’s not going to stop			0
i just do n’t know where that ’s going to be right now			0
' i never feel like i ’m being pushed out of the sport because i ’m definitely going to be in the sport in some form			0
’ @entity12 , 34 , clearly wants to race , and not primarily for the seven - figure salary he would command with one of the big teams — @entity103 , @entity104 or @entity105 — in the @entity106 , which is his most likely refuge			1
that would allow him to combine his driving commitments with broadcasting on @entity21 , although he seems uninterested in a television career at the moment			0
more than anything he wants a winning car , something @entity7 have not provided him with since their last victory two years ago to this very race			1
@entity12 celebrates clinching the @entity21 championship in @entity32 in 2009 ‘ we are not winning races , ’ he said			1
‘ when @entity6 and i were team - mates , we were winning seven or eight between us every year			1
now we do n’t have a car that is quick enough			2
the team know that and that is why we are working bloody hard to improve			2
‘ it is n’t going to stop until the last race ; we have new parts for @entity24 which will hopefully help the car			2
two years of not winning is too long			0
’ @entity12 ’s departure will reduce the number of @entity133 drivers , possibly to just one : @entity6			1
@entity136 ’s @entity135 team are in administration and although they are hopeful of finding investors , there is no guarantee he would keep his place			0
several drivers bring sponsorship to pay for their drives , as @entity136 does			0
‘ it is worrying , ’ said @entity12 , who earns about £ 10million against @entity27 ’s £ 500,000			1
‘ there are fewer and fewer teams hiring drivers on pure talent			0
unless you have a big bucket of gold , you are not going to get into @entity21 and that has been proved by some of the signings we have seen for next season			0
‘ obviously the manufacturers hire on merit , but after that it is a case of money talks rather than skill			0
‘ that is sad considering it is the pinnacle of motorsport			0
’ @entity12 spoke like the elder statesman of the sport he is			2
he might be bitter at his treatment by @entity7 , but otherwise he was content as he talked about his future and his past with a smile on his face			2
@entity173 set for @entity7 move			1

@entity12 is set to be replaced by @entity22 at @entity7
former team - mate @entity6 admits he finds the *decision* baffling
@entity6 says it is the car that needs changing and not @entity12
the *29* - year - old says there are not many drivers around better than @entity12
