by @entity0 published : 20:43 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:55 est , 7 december 2012 personal statements on university application forms should be scrapped because they are unfair to state school pupils , a study claimed today			1
the @entity6 education charity found state pupils are more likely to make writing errors and to struggle to draw on suitable work experience			1
private school pupils are likelier to use ‘ appropriate ’ language in the 600 - word texts and to describe prestigious job placements or other activities			1
unfair : state school pupils were more likely to make errors in their personal statements , the study found half a million of the essays are penned every year by applicants seeking to sell themselves to their preferred universities			1
one private school pupil cited six high - status work placements including a stint on the trading floor of a top firm of stockbrokers and ‘ most recently managing a small gastro pub ’			0
in contrast , a state school pupil had written that ‘ in the final gcse year there was an opportunity for a group of us to manage the school lockers ’			1
the study also warned of growing evidence that personal statements are ‘ for sale ’ and teenagers are paying up to £ 350 for statements written for them by graduates			1
the research , commissioned by the @entity6 education charity , called for the personal statement section of the @entity48 application form to be radically overhauled to prevent pupils ‘ exploiting school type advantages ’			1
it said there was anecdotal evidence some pupils received so much help the statement could not be seen as their ‘ own work ’			2
competition : more than half a million personal statements are penned every year by applicants eager to sell themselves to their chosen university applicants should be only be able to list a limited number of experiences - perhaps as few as one , the report said			0
rather than allowing a ‘ free response ’ , @entity48 should consider inviting applicants to answer a specific question			0
instead of simply listing their previous achievements , applicants should be asked to state which attributes they would bring to a course or university			0
@entity75 , chairman of the @entity6 , said : ‘ personal statements should be more than an excuse to highlight past advantages			2
‘ applicants should outline how they might contribute to campus life , and universities should make it clear that applicants are not penalised for lacking opportunities in the past due to family circumstances			0
’ the study , by dr @entity88 , of @entity89 , analysed 309 personal statements written by teenagers with three bs at a-levels who were applying to the same department of an elite university			0
he found that state school applicants appeared to receive less help in composing their statements and made three times more grammatical , spelling and punctuation errors			1
when discussing work experience , they were more likely to mention saturday jobs such as waitressing at @entity105 or stacking shelves at @entity107 rather than prestigious placements			1
university applicants should be allowed to outline how they might contribute to campus life , the study said one private school applicant had talked of shadowing the @entity114 ambassador to the @entity115			0
privately - educated pupils were also more likely to cite working in family businesses			0
and when it came to listing hobbies and interests , the activities described by state school students tended to ‘ carry little weight in the admissions process ’ , the study said			1
it highlighted examples of private school applicants citing cordon bleu cookery courses at @entity130 ’s school and skiing seasons at @entity132			0
but one state school applicant had written about following @entity134 , adding : ‘ i regularly watch @entity136 and i enjoy the diversity of the @entity138			1
’ seventy per cent of the privately - educated applicants in the study ended up being accepted by an elite university , against just 50 per cent from comprehensives and colleges			0
the report called for state schools to give pupils better advice and guidance in drawing up their statements			0
it added : ‘ @entity48 should consider whether the personal statement , in its current form , is an appropriate and fair indicator of applicants ’ potential			2
’ and it said : ‘ a fairer structure for the personal statement might be one that allows one activity only to be listed			2
’ @entity48 chief executive @entity160 , said : ‘ i have every confidence in the professionalism of admissions officers - they are highly experienced in recognising social factors in the content of personal statements			0
‘ the personal statement is one of a number of pieces of evidence that admissions staff look at when assessing an applicant ’s potential to succeed in higher education			2

state school pupils more likely to make errors and to struggle with suitable work experience , study found
@entity6 also warned some teenagers pay up to £ 350 for a graduate to write their personal statement
