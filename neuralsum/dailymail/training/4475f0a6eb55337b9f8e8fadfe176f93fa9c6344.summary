hugging @entity14 tight , @entity9 went back inside the mall and ended up hiding in an inventory room with about 40 other people while @entity52 - linked gunmen massacred innocent mallgoers outside			1
he said at one point it seemed the terrorists may have discovered their hiding spot as a group of people who had left the storage room suddenly started rushing back in , screaming			1
' aside from that initial explosion , this was probably the most terrifying moment , ' @entity9 told @entity37 , ' not knowing if perhaps the people who had left had encountered some of the attackers who were then coming into the area that we were hiding			2
