@entity1 head coach @entity0 was impressed by the way @entity3 performed on his comeback from a nine - month injury lay - off			1
the 24 - year - old had been laid low since march with a pelvic complaint which caused the right - back to miss the @entity9 and the start of the @entity12 's reign in north @entity13			1
@entity3 suffered a setback in september and underwent lower abdominal surgery - a move the north @entity13 club had hoped to avoid - but on thursday he at last made his first - team return			2
@entity3 made his long - awaited return to the @entity1 first team against @entity21 on thursday night @entity21 winger @entity22 tumbles to the ground while the @entity25 full back protects the ball the @entity25 full - back admitted he was a ' little rusty ' in the 75 minutes he managed in @entity27 , but @entity0 was impressed by his display in the 1 - 0 @entity30 defeat to @entity21			1
' i think that he did well , ' the @entity1 head coach said			0
' he had a very good performance			0
he showed that he is fit and we decided only to play him for 75 minutes because it is good for his first official game after his injury			1
i am happy because he is a very good player and an important player for us			2
' @entity0 was impressed by @entity3 's performance against @entity21 the @entity42 - born full back could n't prevent @entity1 slipping to a 1 - 0 loss to @entity21 on his return fans at the @entity46 had to use their phones after the lights went out to suspend play @entity3 's return was one of few highlights on a disappointing evening for @entity1 at the @entity46			1
@entity0 was frustrated by the ' laughable ' floodlight failures at @entity21 ' temporary home , although he was more annoyed by his players ' poor showing in front of goal			2
@entity59 was the main culprit , with those missed opportunities allowing @entity62 to secure @entity64 's side the victory which saw them go above @entity1 at the top of @entity67 both sides were already assured of a place in monday 's last - 32 draw heading into the match , but the defeat means @entity1 , in theory , will now get a tougher draw			1
@entity3 , who missed the @entity9 in @entity75 , has been out for nine months with an abdominal injury @entity3 shakes hands with members of @entity1 's bench after being substituted in @entity80 the north @entity81 will face a @entity30 group winner or one of the best - performing @entity84 drop - outs , meaning the mouth - watering prospect of facing @entity87 , managed by former @entity1 head coach @entity88 , is on the cards			1
' we need to look forward , ' @entity0 said			0
' we have to see the draw on monday			0
' it is a shame because we would have finished top of the table ( with a point ) , but now we need to look forward			0
' we have to be focused not just on this competition , as we have the @entity97 on sunday and , after , on wednesday against @entity98 in the @entity99			0
' ' we need to see the draw on monday and to win the @entity30			0
it 's a shame we did n't finish on the top of the table			0
