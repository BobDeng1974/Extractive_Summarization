by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:04 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 16 august 2013 extremist : @entity3 was finally deported to @entity4 following a decade - long legal battle the family of @entity7 hate - preacher @entity3 yesterday left their taxpayer - funded life in @entity10 for good			1
the fanatic ’s wife and five children last night boarded a plane to @entity4 to join @entity15 , who is awaiting trial on a string of terrorist charges			1
the flight was funded by the government but it means the @entity10 is finally rid of a family which has cost the country at least £ 500,000 in benefits since first arriving in the early 1990s			2
it also completes a major victory for home secretary @entity28 , who succeeded in having @entity15 – known as @entity31 ’s ambassador in @entity32 – booted out last month , after a £ 3million legal fight			0
the @entity34 moved into a taxpayer - funded £ 450,000 four - bedroom detached house in @entity37 , north - west @entity38 , earlier this year while his deportation battle was still ongoing			2
@entity3 always insisted his family wanted to join him in @entity4 , but there was scepticism at @entity44			1
the two youngest children were born in @entity10 and have @entity10 passports so could not have been forcibly removed			2
and @entity3 ’s wife could herself have asked to stay on human rights grounds , arguing that she should not be separated from her children			1
win : it also completes a major victory for home secretary @entity28 , who succeeded in having @entity15 - known as @entity31 's ambassador in @entity32 - booted out last month , after a £ 3million legal fight but the family members not born here have now dropped their claim to stay in @entity10 permanently			1
@entity60 officials indicated that the family could be barred if they tried to return to the @entity10			0
however , that could prove complicated because of the youngest children ’s @entity10 passports			0
@entity66 mp @entity65 said : ‘ every taxpayer will be mightily relieved to see the family follow @entity15			0
it grates for hard - working @entity10 to see the family of a terrorist king - pin milking the system			0
‘ now we must change the rules to prevent this kind of nonsense happening again			0

@entity3 's wife and children *formally* drop their *bid* to stay in the @entity10
move comes after @entity83 finally deported the extremist to @entity4
it followed decade - long legal battle costing taxpayer millions of *pounds*
