by @entity0 greg @entity1 , a senior lawyer in the @entity2 , tried to justify the cost of the case at the @entity5 by saying it was n't about phone hacking but about a need to probe privacy breaches prosecutors have come under fire after a leading @entity2 lawyer suggested the £ 100million hacking trial was necessary to ‘ explore the culture of invading privacy ’			1
@entity1 , a senior lawyer in the @entity2 , tried to justify the cost of the case at the @entity5 by saying it was n’t about phone hacking but about a need to probe privacy breaches			1
but critics pointed out that the @entity22 into press standards had already addressed the issue			1
a stream of celebrities poured into the @entity27 two years ago to talk about alleged wrongdoing by the sections of the press and to call for tighter regulations			2
critics also said that during the eight - month phone - hacking trial – which finished with just one conviction this week – it emerged that friends , family and even celebrities themselves happily sold stories to the @entity42 for money , influence or to prolong their own time in the headlines			1
despite this , mr @entity1 insisted : ‘ this case was not about whether phone hacking took place or whether public officials were paid for information ; there are a significant number of recent convictions which show that both did happen			1
‘ this has been a lengthy and complex trial which was required to explore a culture of invading privacy			2
’ privacy experts said a criminal trial was not the appropriate forum to explore such issues			2
@entity64 , head of media law at @entity66 , said : ‘ a criminal trial is not really the forum to explore the issue of the invasion of privacy			1
we have already had the @entity73 inquiry to do that and there have been a large number of civil actions going through the courts that have also fulfilled that role			0
’ @entity2 lawyer suggested the £ 100million hacking trial at the @entity5 was necessary to ' explore the culture of invading privacy ' it came as former @entity42 managing editor @entity84 , one of five people acquitted this week , claimed he was ‘ stitched up ’ and that the press was unfairly targeted by police and prosecutors			1
in an interview with @entity91 , mr @entity84 , who worked at the tabloid from 1980 until 2009 , said he and his co-accused had been ‘ rounded up ’ as part of an ‘ assault ’ on the @entity30			0
‘ i ’ve lived with this frankly hideous nightmare for three years			0
there was no substance to it , ’ he said			0
‘ but i was obviously part of a group who were to be rounded up			0
i think the state , through its legal arms – the @entity2 , the @entity105 – chose to take on the @entity30			0
’ mr @entity84 was cleared of being part of the hacking conspiracy dating back to 2000			2
he added : ‘ i resent it for my colleagues , and i am inclined to use the term stitch - up , because that ’s what i believe it was			0
and what lies behind it was an absolute unmerited assault on a free press			0
