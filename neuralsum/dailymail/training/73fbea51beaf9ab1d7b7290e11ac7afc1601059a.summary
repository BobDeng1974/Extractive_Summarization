by @entity0 @entity1 is turning off voters with ‘ vacuous sloganeering ’ and the ‘ torturous repetition of political mantras ’ like ‘ @entity6 ’ , one of his leading backbenchers said yesterday			1
@entity9 , the mp for @entity10 , complained that @entity11 are ordered to ‘ parrot ’ the phrase in every public utterance			1
mr @entity9 is regularly used by the @entity16 press office as an attack dog , supplying quotes condemning the @entity19			2
warning : @entity9 , mp for @entity10 , has warned the party 's leader to find a new handle for the election but in an article for @entity25 yesterday , he sank his teeth into the @entity16 leader , warning that voters are repulsed by the ‘ on message ’ discipline once imposed by @entity31 ’s spindoctor @entity30			1
mr @entity1 made the catchphrase ‘ @entity16 ’ a centrepiece of his 2012 speech to the @entity37 conference and the party even has a magazine called ‘ @entity6 ’			2
but mr @entity9 complained : ‘ we ’ve already been told , from the very top , to intertwine ‘ one nation ’ into every policy statement we make , to build it into speeches , to continually repeat the phrase ‘ one nation ’ at every opportunity			1
‘ i ’m beginning to worry we have n’t moved on from the 1990s			0
but i ’m no longer sure simply repeating a key message or phrase has the same resonance with electors that it once had			0
’ mr @entity9 praised the ‘ @entity6 ’ speech as ‘ excellent ’ and a ‘ land grab moment ’ for mr @entity1			1
‘ but please , ’ he added , ‘ it ’s not a general election winning strapline is it ? the public is n’t as accepting of such simple messaging any more			1
indeed , i ’ve come to believe the public is actively turned off by the torturous repetition of political mantras			0
caution : @entity9 described @entity1 's speech last year as a ' land grab moment ' but now mps are being ordered to ' parrot ' the phrase in every appearance as they try to garner votes for the general election ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a coincidence that neither the @entity73 nor the @entity74 have invested effort in coming up with a strapline that is expected to have so much resonance among the electorate - i think they understand such an approach is too simple and outdated			1
’ mr @entity9 argued that the @entity11 most trusted by the public are those who demonstrate ‘ authenticity ’ by speaking their minds			1
‘ it ’s about showing character , imagination and a deeper understanding of people ’s lives , ’ he said			0
‘ it is n’t a coincidence that people like @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 or @entity96 have the ability to communicate more effectively with the wider public - it ’s because they are perceived to speak their mind , to say not what their party wants them to say , but what they think			2
‘ those involved in politics need to speak as they find , they need to show a more emotional , common sense connection with the things that matter to voters and , yes , be a little less message - disciplined			0
’ mr @entity9 also criticised @entity19 ministers for spouting @entity113 ’s favourite buzz phrases ‘ global race ’ and ‘ hard - working families ’ - a sentiment shared by a large number of conservative mps			2
competition : he cited @entity120 mayor @entity93 ( left ) and @entity121 leader @entity96 ( right ) as leaders that capture the public 's attention by appearing to speak their mind , not what their party wants them to say ‘ when the @entity19 chairman @entity127 pops up on the news and tries to crowbar the phrase “ for hardworking people ” into every sentence no one honestly thinks he has any connection with the lives of people striving to do right for their families , ’ mr @entity9 said			1
‘ it ’s just vacuous sloganeering			0
’ but he made clear that the same applies to his own leader			0
‘ while being on message still holds sway in the @entity37 i would argue that an opposite approach would be much more beneficial			0
‘ it needs to be less about a slogan , such as “ one nation ” and much more about developing an understanding amongst the electorate that we ’re on their side , that we understand their worries and that we have the solutions to help them get on			0
this can not be achieved through sloganeering			0
’ @entity19 mp @entity155 said : ‘ the curtain is lifted on @entity1 ’s empty @entity6 rhetoric			2
‘ this vacuous slogan belies @entity16 ’s core philosophy of more spending , more borrowing and more taxes , exactly what got us into an economic mess in the first place			0
‘ as @entity9 points out , @entity1 ca n’t move on from the policies that brought this country to its knees under @entity16 and no amount of short - term gimmicks will con the public into trusting @entity16 on the economy again			1

@entity10 mp @entity9 says @entity11 ordered to ' parrot ' phrase
hailed @entity6 speech as ' nation - grabbing moment ' but offered warning
said public is not accepting of such simple messaging any more
