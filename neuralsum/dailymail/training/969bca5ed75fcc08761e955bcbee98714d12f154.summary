by @entity0 four boys on a school trip have unearthed a 4,300 - year - old hair tress which is being described as one of the most significant recent archaeological finds in the @entity6			1
the boys , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , were on a local dig in @entity13 , @entity14 , when they saw a glint of gold in the soil			1
to their astonishment it turned out to be an ancient hair tress and one of the earliest ever pieces of metal work to have been found in the @entity6			1
the ornament may have been worn by a first - generation metal worker who could have travelled to @entity6 from overseas in search of gold and copper			2
the tresses are very rare and only ten finds have ever been made in @entity6 seven - year - old @entity8 said : ' we were digging carefully in the ground and i saw something shiny , it was gold			2
' me and @entity9 started dancing with joy			0
' the intricately decorated tress dates back to about 2,300 @entity53 , a period known as the @entity54 , which is @entity55 his friend , eight - year - old @entity9 added : ' when i first saw it i felt happy but i thought it was plastic			1
when i found out it was gold , i was very happy			2
' the intricately decorated tress , which dates back to about 2,300 @entity53 , a period known as the @entity54 , which is @entity55 , was found in a burial mound alongside three beautiful flint arrowheads and a jet button			1

during the project , the boys learned about local archaeology , which inspired them to attend the community dig. the ornament may have been worn by a first - generation metal worker who could have travelled to @entity6 from overseas in search of gold and copper @entity10 , ten , said : ' we did some work on the @entity54 at school which was really interesting			1
' but to take part in the actual excavation , and to find things , was awesome			0
' @entity11 , also 10 , added : ' we went to see the site before it had been dug up with our class			0
i ca n't wait to go back to school to tell everyone because they will never believe what we found			0
' the head tress , along with arrowheads and button , will now be analysed by specialists			2
@entity102 , who leads the @entity33 project said : ' all archaeological sites are important in their own way , but this is exceptional			0
' it can be regarded as marking the very start of mineral exploitation in the @entity110 , leading in due course to @entity113 exploitation of lead and silver , and eventually to the vast post-medieval lead industry for which the region is internationally famous			0
