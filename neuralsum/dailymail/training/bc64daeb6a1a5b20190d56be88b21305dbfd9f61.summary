by @entity0 , @entity1 caretaker boss @entity2 does not want saturday 's dramatic late 2 - 1 defeat at @entity4 to be his last in charge of @entity6			1
@entity2 was in temporary charge at the @entity8 following the shock departure of @entity10 less than 48 hours before the new @entity12 season kicked off			1
the well - organised @entity6 were left frustrated after taking the lead through a first - half header from @entity15 , one of the few summer signings sanctioned by chairman @entity17 , as the @entity18 fought back to snatch victory in stoppage time through @entity21			1
job plea : @entity2 is keen on replacing @entity10 on a permanent basis following @entity10 ' exit proud man : @entity2 was pleased with @entity6 's display against @entity4 @entity27 flicked in a free - kick from Â£ 30million @entity29 forward @entity30 to level before the break			1
@entity4 lacked a cutting edge in the final third , creating only a few half - chances against a side who had @entity37 sent off for a second yellow card - until @entity21 slotted home after @entity39 's shot was saved			1
@entity2 , who was in temporary charge last season after @entity44 left ahead of @entity10 ' appointment in november , feels he has unfinished business with the club			1
' i am proud of the players , of the performance , but am disappointed not to get something which we deserved , ' he said			2
' when you think what the players have been through in the last couple of days , you are never quite sure how they are going to respond to @entity10 leaving			1
' we said to them before the game " make sure there are no excuses " because i did n't want to have to stand up for them and say their heads were n't right to do a job because of what 's happened			0
' late winner : @entity67 international @entity21 scored late on for @entity4 at the @entity8 @entity2 continued : ' would i like it to be my last game ? no , i would like to continue			1
' i enjoy being in charge			2
whether it 's the right time or not , i will speak to the chairman on sunday			0
' in the last two days the chairman has not had a chance to speak to the players , he 's not spoken to me about what his ideas are going forward , he just said " let 's focus on today 's game "			0
' on monday i am sure there will be some more conversations			2
the players need to know which direction the club is going			0
hopefully at the start of the week there will be some more answers			0
' if the chairman felt it was right for me i would sit down and talk to him about it			0
' i like working at this club and i certainly enjoy working with the players because they are a good honest group that works hard for you			0
' whoever takes over will have little chance to bring in the required additions before the transfer window closes			0
' we have identified all summer the areas we need to strengthen but for whatever reason it 's not happened , ' said @entity2			2
' @entity10 knew what players he wanted and the club do			2
the new manager who comes in , in two weeks he 's got to know which players he wants			0
it 's not ideal if a club chooses them - you need a manager to choose new players			2
' mutual respect : @entity116 would be happy to play under @entity6 's temporary manager @entity2 veteran @entity6 forward @entity116 believes @entity2 would have the trust of the players to take the club forwards			1
' a lot of the players have worked with @entity2 for a long time and respect him , ' said @entity116 , who joined from @entity124 in 2011 , helping the club win promotion two years ago and was on the bench at @entity4			1
' we showed in the time when he took over from @entity44 ( @entity44 ) and again today that we work hard for him and enjoy playing under him			0
' it has got to be the right man now , and it will take as long as it takes , that is up to the hierarchy			0

@entity139 lost 2 - 1 against @entity4 at the @entity8
