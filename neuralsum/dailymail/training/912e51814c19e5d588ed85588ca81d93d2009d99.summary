by @entity0 last updated at 12:31 pm on 12th december 2011 struggling through : more people are dragging themselves to work despite being ill , a survey found the days of exaggerating cold and flu symptoms to get a day off are over , a survey has found , as workers fear ' pulling a sickie ' could get them the sack			1
people are now so concerned about job security they will trudge into work even when genuinely ill to underline their commitment to the job			0
the survey by @entity16 found that half of workers had not taken a single day off sick so far in 2011 because of cold or flu , despite actually being ill at least three times			2
the average number of days taken off sick due to such illnesses is now just two days a year , half the number compared to three years ago			1
this fall in cold and flu absenteeism means that such illnesses are estimated to have cost the @entity25 a mere £ 4.6 billion in 2011 , compared with more than £ 9 billion three years ago			1
workers ’ top two reasons for battling on even when ill were ‘ concerns over job security ’ and ‘ not wanting to let colleagues down ’ , which together polled more than 90 per cent of the vote			0
' our survey makes interesting reading because the figures show the difference in workers ’ attitudes to sickness and job security in just three short years , ' said @entity40 , spokesman for @entity16			0
pressures : out of the 1,000 people surveyed 90 per cent said they would go into work despite being ill as they were concerned about job security ' when we carried out our last study , fears over job security were not a strong factor , but we are now several years into the economic downturn , and with warnings of even tougher times ahead no one wants to be singled out as a weak link at work ' workers aged between 25 and 34 were found to have had the greatest number of colds and days off in 2011 , three apiece , possibly due to hectic lifestyles that revolve around work and play , leaving them more exposed to illnesses such as the common cold			1
people in the @entity65 were found to have had the most colds , an average of three , while those living and working in @entity69 have had the fewest , just two			2
pulling a sickie : the days of exaggerating cold and flu symptoms to have a day at home are over workers in @entity75 , @entity76 and the @entity77 took the least time off when ill in 2011 , with more than two thirds from each region declining to take a single day off for a cold or flu			2
meanwhile , the only major difference between men and women still appears to be their perception of how ill they really are when suffering with a cold or flu			0
out of 1,000 people surveyed three quarters of men claimed they genuinely thought they suffered when they were ill more than women .			0

average number of sick days per year halved to just two
fall in *winter* sickies saved @entity25 economy £ *4.4* billion in 2011
