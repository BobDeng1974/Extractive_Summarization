by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 after the trophy had been presented and the players had finished spraying @entity4 with champagne , i went down on to the @entity7 pitch to say my congratulations			0
the last time @entity9 won a trophy — in 2005 — i had n’t even been that bothered about going to the game and i certainly did n’t feel emotional			1
after all , @entity9 were used to winning trophies all the time			1
on saturday , i did feel emotional and i would n’t have missed being there for the world			0
i was with @entity16 , who is a huge @entity9 fan , and we spotted @entity4 so went over to say hello			1
he looked a bit dishevelled as he ’d just been given the bumps by his players and had to change out of his suit and into a tracksuit			0
i said to him that he looked like he ’d just run a marathon			0
@entity24 : @entity0 watched the cup final with huge @entity9 fan @entity16 emotional : @entity9 ended nine years without a trophy by beating @entity27 at @entity7 he wore a huge grin			1
i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen him happier			0
i think he was just delighted to be answering questions about winning a trophy — he probably wondered if it would ever happen again			1
at 2 - 0 , i was worried for him , concerned that his reputation would n’t recover from losing such a game			2
instead , the team found a way to win and now @entity4 is a winner again			0
that ’s what trophies do			0
people were doubting whether he still had it in him but here was proof that he did			0
i also spoke to @entity49 , who has without doubt become @entity9 ’s no 1 player , the first name on the team - sheet			1
last season he was trying too hard at times but the improvement has been vast			2
he refused to accept that @entity9 would lose and kept taking the game to @entity27 , making runs in behind them again and again			1
the winning goal was down to his persistence and was a fantastic finish			2
first step : but the @entity61 must continue to win delighted : @entity4 answered a lot of critics with the @entity65 win i told him that the game will forever be remembered as the ‘ @entity68 ’ and that he ’s gone down in history			1
he ’s scored 16 goals this season and , amazingly , came back from injury playing at the same high standard as earlier in the season			2
yet he could have been in goal facing penalties in a shootout too if @entity77 had made contact with @entity79 , 40 yards out , in those crazy closing moments			0
@entity81 is worthy of a mention too			0
he was once again left out of the team but you would n’t have known it from his celebrations			0
he showed true dignity and class as club captain — there was not a hint of bitterness in his behaviour			0
the players will be desperate to win more trophies now			0
i did n’t win my first until 1998 — i was injured for the 1994 cup - winners ’ cup final — and the waiting weighs heavily			2
but then you just become hungry for a repeat and try even harder			0
no 1 : @entity49 has grown to become @entity9 's most important player agonising : @entity79 saw a late , late chance cleared off the line by @entity104 to do that , @entity9 will have to add to their squad			1
yes , they are a maturing group of players but fans spend their hard - earned cash each week on tickets and merchandise and they want to see it invested in the transfer market			2
signing @entity114 in some way reunited the fans and the club , and they will expect the same again			1
football is not just about being competitive on the pitch , but being competitive off it			0
@entity121 looks likely to leave and @entity81 and @entity122 could follow			0
@entity4 must decide whether to make @entity124 his right back or buy a replacement			2
that could mean buying three defenders when they would surely rather spend money improving things at the other end			0
dignified : club captain @entity81 acted in a brilliant manner despite being left out potential : @entity114 needs to play with a striker who has the pace and willingness to latch onto his passes @entity136 has done very well , netting 22 times , but his place needs to be under more pressure			1
@entity9 need a world - class centre forward who can offer something different from @entity136 — someone with real pace who can run in behind defences			1
@entity146 and @entity147 used to fill that role			1
with the right target , @entity114 and @entity149 will cause havoc , picking him out time after time			1
at the moment , especially with @entity152 injured , @entity9 are too reliant on @entity49 ’s runs from deep			1
added to that should be a tough - tackling midfielder			2
yes , half the @entity156 is looking for the next @entity157 or @entity158 , but @entity9 need to find him .			1

after winning the @entity65 against @entity27 , @entity9 must carry on their success
i was watching with @entity163 champion @entity16
@entity49 has grown hugely this season , he is @entity9 's no 1 player
as good as @entity136 has been , @entity9 need a striker in the @entity146 or @entity147 mould - that will make @entity114 better
