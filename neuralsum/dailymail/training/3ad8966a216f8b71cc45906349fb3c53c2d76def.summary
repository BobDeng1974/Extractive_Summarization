he goes on to say that the @entity1 is singularly plagued by these violent attacks in part because of a climate of fear and paranoia and weak gun laws that enable ' disturbed white males ' to get their hands on deadly weapons - @entity44 was found to have three .9mm semi-automatic gun and more than 400 rounds of ammunition , all of which was legally purchased and registered			1
@entity2 writes that while other countries have more violent histories than the @entity1 , more guns per capita and consume the same violent movies and video games as the @entity1 , but none have anywhere near the rates of mass killings that @entity1 does			2

' we wo n't pass the necessary laws , but more importantly we wo n't consider why this happens here all the time , ' he writes			0
' when the @entity72 says , " guns do n't kill people - people kill people , " they 've got it half - right			0
