a host of ridiculous @entity2 inventions so strange they were never made it into production have been revealed for the first time			1
the quirky designs , which include a corset with inflatable bust , a portable bath and a ventilating hat , have been held at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , for 150 years			1
known as the ‘ age of invention ’ , the era welcomed breakthroughs from the likes of @entity20 , who was famed for his construction of lighthouses , and engineer @entity23 - who designed the first propeller - driven transatlantic steamship			1
it works by inflating the cups with a tube to make the breasts appear larger the @entity37 , invented by @entity38 in 1849 , was designed to stop gentlemen 's heads overheating while wearing top hats , a big problem at the time and everyday people began coming up with their own creations in the hope that they would hit on a big idea that could change their lives			1
the inventing craze was kick - started when laws allowing ideas to be copyrighted quickly and cheaply were introduced in 1843			0
each design , such as the @entity53 and a portable hair brushing machine , was logged in enormous books which were then archived			0
it also includes designs for a moustache protector , a pair of glasses with two sets of lenses and a gadget that doubles up as a knife and fork , as well as a device to get shoes on and off			0
the inventions have been collecting dust at the @entity12 until record specialist for registered designs , @entity68 , sifted through them			1
she has now complied them into a book called ‘ inventions that did n’t @entity77 ’			1
described as a useful new design the portable bath , which is set upon wheels , was designed by @entity81 and @entity82 in @entity83 in 1861 the @entity84 and @entity85 , invented by , @entity86 in 1881 was designed with the intentions that people would be able to eat with one hand mrs @entity90 said : ‘ these designs were registered in the mid- 1800s following the introduction of the @entity93 which protected “ useful ” inventions under copyright			1
‘ it was much cheaper and quicker for smaller inventors to register their designs this way rather than go down the long , expensive patenting route			0
‘ there was a rush of inventors wanting to copyright their ideas			0
’ she explained that the designers had to take their inventions to the @entity109 at @entity110 in @entity111 where they would be given a registered design number			0
‘ designers had to provide two identical drawings of their designs , one of which was stuck into a huge leather - bound volumes and the other would be returned to the copyright holder , ’ she added			0
‘ gradually these volumes of designs built up and because they belonged to the government they eventually ended up at the @entity12 for safekeeping			2
a design for a ' jack ' for putting on and pulling off boots , invented by , @entity127 , in 1846			0
it features in the new book complied from the @entity12 a design for an @entity131 , invented by @entity132 in 1862 - the same year an mp was the victim of a robbery by garrotting a moustache protector , designed by @entity137 in 1867 , is among several designs that never made it into production from the @entity2 era of inventions ‘ these enormous tomes are full of the most amazing inventions , a lot of which never saw the light of day			1
‘ at that time there was such a culture of entrepreneurship and a real interest in how things worked , partly thanks to the success of inventors like @entity20 and @entity23			1
‘ it ’s surprising how many designs were submitted by people inventing things to do with their own line of business			2
‘ surgeons would register designs for surgical instruments and cooks would register designs for kitchen products			0
‘ the designs seem humorous or inexplicably strange now but a lot of them made sense in the context of the period of time			2
a @entity174 , invented by @entity175 , in 1864			0
everyday people of the time hoped their designs would take off and change their lives this figure shows the design for a ' breast reliever ' , which was invented by @entity183 , in 1849			1
it never made it into production and collected dust elsewhere ‘ a lot of the problems these inventions set out to solve have been lost in the mist of time but back then they were real issues			1
‘ for example , the anti-garrotting cravat was designed in response to a real scare at that time when convicts who would have normally been sent to the colonies were being pardoned			1
‘ it was registered in 1862 , the same year an mp was the victim of a robbery by garrotting			0
‘ the @entity37 was designed to stop gentlemen 's heads overheating while wearing top hats , a big problem at the time			2
‘ my favourite is the corset with an expansible bust			2
obviously body image was as big an issue for @entity2 women as it is for us nowadays and this design allowed for the bust to be inflated using a tube			0
‘ the @entity2 period was known as the age of invention and most people only know about the big inventions like trains , the telegraph and the telephone			2
‘ but there was a whole sub-culture of inventing going on which we never get to hear about			0
‘ these designs are little known about and have never been published before			2
we wanted to show people what a productive time it was			0
’ designs reflected things that were possibly needed at the time like this one for an ' invalid 's @entity239 ' , invented by @entity241 , in 1852 a bed rest supporter , invented by @entity243 in 1850 , pictured left , and the front cover of the new book ' inventions that did n't @entity77 ' , right			1

designs including corset with inflatable bust and a portable bath held at @entity12 for 150 years
everyday people came up with their own inventions after success of @entity23 and @entity20
other inventions were a reflection of the time including a ventilating top hat and anti-garrotting cravat
such designs were possibly too far fetched even for the @entity263 and never made it into production
they were collecting dust and a record specialist turned them into book ' inventions that did n't @entity77 '
inventions that did n't change the @entity275 is published by @entity276 on *october* 13 and costs *£* *19.95* .
