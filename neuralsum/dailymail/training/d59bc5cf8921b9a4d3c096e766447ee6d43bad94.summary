it is an incredible view of some of the last untouched areas on earth - and one that may not be around for long			2
@entity5 has released a series of images of ' sanctuaries ' around the globe as part of a new book released this week that highlights how the view from space is being used to protect some of the world 's most interesting , changing , and threatened places			2
protected areas featured in ' sanctuary ' include @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity21 's @entity20 , the weaving waterways of the @entity23 in @entity24 , and the @entity25 in @entity26			1
in july 2014 , @entity27 8 captured the isolated island of protected forest around @entity21 's @entity30			1
@entity31 in @entity20 surrounded by once - forested pasturelands			0
experts say this and similar images are key in protecting the world 's ' sanctuaries '			0
the book is available for free download as a @entity41 file ( @entity42 ) here ' sanctuary : exploring the @entity45 's protected areas from @entity46 , ' published by the @entity47 ( @entity48 , @entity49 ) with support from @entity5 , debuted at the 2014 @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity26			1
the once - a - decade meeting is sponsored by the @entity54 , the world 's largest global environmental organization founded in 1948			1
combining satellite imagery with nature photography , descriptions of conservation projects , and comments from park leaders and conservationists , ' sanctuary ' illustrates the contributions remote sensing is making to reaching conservation goals , responding to climate change , and improving human health and well - being			0
in the book 's foreword , @entity5 administrator @entity70 wrote , ' @entity5 and numerous other space agency partners from around the globe have used this view from space to make incredible scientific advances in our understanding of how our planet works			0
' as a result , we can now better gauge the impact of human activity on our environment and measure how and why our atmosphere , oceans , and land are changing			0
' as a former astronaut who has looked upon our beautiful planet from space , i hope that we can advance the use of space - based remote sensing and other geospatial tools to study , understand , and improve the management of the world 's parks and protected areas as well as the precious biodiversity that thrives within their borders			1
' there are about 209,000 protected areas worldwide , covering 14 percent of the planet 's land and 11 percent of coastal areas , as well as 3.6 percent of the world 's oceans			1
one type of conservation effort highlighted in the book is the growing trend of connecting areas to protect migrating species such as the pronghorn , which migrates the longest distance of any terrestrial animal in the @entity117 : more than 350 miles			0
@entity118 , director of the @entity117 @entity119 , states : ' for the first time in my nearly 40 years of work in the @entity119 , the four @entity117 land management agencies are working together , applying the newest geospatial technologies to identify and protect critical corridors of connectivity between protected areas			1
' development and agricultural clearing ( pink areas ) are shown encroaching the @entity23 mangroves along the @entity131 in this @entity27 image taken in march 2014			1
imagery and content in ' sanctuary ' were provided by a range of space an environmental organisations			0
they include @entity5 's @entity140 , @entity5 's @entity141 , the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) , @entity143 , the @entity144 , @entity145 , the @entity146 , and other organizations			2
space - based @entity45 observations are also used as inputs into advanced computer models to help identify and predict environmental changes			0
with this information the conservation community can develop adaptation strategies and prepare for impacts such as disrupted migrations or increased wildfires , floods , and drought			0
by integrating climate model forecasts with an understanding of species habitat ranges , scientists can estimate where species may live in the future , where today 's protected areas might suffer stress , or where future protected areas may need to be located			1
for over 10 years , @entity5 's basic research and applied conservation programs have advanced our understanding of global change impacts within and around protected areas			1
ongoing projects include assessing coral reef health , investigating the vulnerability of @entity179 to climate change , and establishing marine biodiversity observation networks			0
@entity5 's @entity45 science program has made numerous satellite - derived data products freely available to the research and applications community to support conservation around the world			2
@entity26 â€™s @entity188 as seen by @entity189 in 2000 shows the only sand dunes in a desert of scrub and rock .			2

released to *coincide* with the 2014 @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity26 , a once - a - decade meeting
protected areas include @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity21 's @entity198 , the weaving waterways of the @entity23 in @entity24 , and the @entity25 in @entity26
