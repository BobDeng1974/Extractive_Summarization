@entity0 insists the blame for @entity3 ’s defensive frailties must be shared collectively as they prepare for the ultimate test against @entity6			1
though the @entity9 holders look set to be without @entity10 on wednesday night , they still arrive on @entity11 with a scintillating array of attacking options and players who will be aware of how vulnerable @entity3 have been this year			2
@entity3 have shipped 16 goals in all competitions and have not had a clean sheet since their one and only shutout against @entity20 on august 31 , so many will be anticipating that @entity22 , @entity23 will pick them off at will			0
@entity0 and @entity24 both agree that @entity3 need to improve when they face @entity6 @entity0 clears the ball off the line during the 3 - 2 win against @entity30 on sunday , in which the defence was poor a game against @entity6 would , ordinarily , have the city gripped with excitement for days beforehand but on monday the mood was flat , stemming from the fortuitous 3 - 2 win over @entity30 , a performance that was strewn with defensive errors			1
@entity0 , however , believes it would be unfair to make the back four and goalkeeper @entity40 culpable every time they concede and has called for unity in the build - up to a contest that he points out has the capacity to transform @entity3 ’s campaign			1
‘ the easiest way is always to criticise the defenders and keeper , ’ said @entity0 , who is only one of two players to remain from the starting line - up ( @entity48 is the other ) the last time @entity3 faced @entity6 in march 2009 — an extraordinary game which saw @entity51 ’s side win 4 - 0			1
‘ but i ’ve said it before that defending is n’t only about the back four , it is about the whole team			2
we are attacking together and we are defending together			0
we know it was n’t good enough ( at @entity30 ) , but we will try to improve			1
@entity0 says the whole team is to blame for @entity3 's disappointing form , not only their defence @entity24 says he was unhappy after the @entity30 game , despite @entity65 's late winner at @entity66 ' every game is important for us , especially in the @entity9 because you only have six group matches and we want to qualify for the next round			1
‘ every game has its own story			2
maybe we will be happy with a point , maybe disappointed but at the moment we are only thinking of getting three			0
@entity3 's defence wo n’t be looking forward to facing @entity22 on wednesday night , but there is some hope for them			1
despite scoring 18 goals in his last 10 games for club and country , he has never scored at @entity84			0
at @entity87 the @entity86 star played @entity3 on their own turf five games but drew a blank in each			0
he did , however , manage three wins and a draw , losing just once			0
‘ this is what we play for			0
the @entity9 is the best competition in the world because you face the best players in the world			0
in my eyes , they are the best team in the world so this is a big challenge for us , but we ’ll do our best and try to get a good result			2
’ that message was shared by @entity24 , @entity0 ’s partner at the heart of the defence			1
having looked a colossus when he scored a thumping header to crown an impressive display in a friendly against @entity112 , his form has since matched that of his new team			2
he has looked increasingly shaky but , to his credit , the @entity116 centre half has recognised that standards have not been good enough and he wants to banish the memory of what happened at @entity66 in the best possible manner			0
@entity22 ( right ) has started the season in blistering form , with 18 goals in 10 competitive games @entity0 described last year 's @entity9 winners @entity6 as the ' best team in the world ' video real ready for tough week - @entity128 ‘ i was glad it was over because i think one minute more and it would have been 3 - 3 , ’ said @entity24 with brutal honesty			1
‘ it is the first time in my career i was unhappy after the game even though we won because we did n’t play good			1
‘ we need to be better and in our next game against @entity6 we need to show more			0
their players , we know who they are and we will prepare a little bit different			0
but we will not play like that against @entity6 , you can be sure of that			0
’ @entity143 , meanwhile , has admitted the sale of @entity145 ‘ halted ’ the momentum that carried @entity3 to second place in the @entity149 last season but , in an interview with @entity152 newspaper as , @entity143 insisted there was reason for ‘ excitement ’ at @entity84			2
@entity10 is set to miss out on the trip to @entity84 , but @entity6 's attack will still carry plenty of threat @entity22 has never scored a goal at @entity84 , but did win three of his five trips there with @entity87 ‘ the natural progress of the team has been halted in some way in the summer with @entity145 leaving and lots of new players coming in , ’ said @entity143 , who also revealed that he has an ambition to manage in @entity152 one day			1
‘ it ’s an exciting time at @entity3 with lots of young players coming in but if we are going to get better , we are going to take the short - term hit at the moment knowing that in the long term the club will be better for it			0
’ @entity143 says the natural progression of the team has been slowed by @entity145 's move to @entity178			1

@entity0 says @entity143 ' side can recover their form on wednesday against ' the best team in the world '
' we are only thinking of getting three points ' says @entity0
defender insists it is up to the whole team , not just defence , to play better
@entity24 says he ' was unhappy after @entity30 game even though we won '
' we need to be better and in our next game ' said @entity24
