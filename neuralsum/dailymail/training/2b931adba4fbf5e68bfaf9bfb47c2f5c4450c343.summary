by @entity0 published : 16:19 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:32 est , 7 february 2014 getting stuck in rush - hour traffic is enough to make anyone 's blood boil			1
but one driver was left ' seething ' after being given a parking ticket for stopping at a bus stop while in a jam at a set of red lights			1
@entity12 , 50 , was issued with a £ 70 fine by a mobile camera car in @entity15 , @entity16 , in december last year			1
@entity17 , 50 , was left ' seething ' after being photographed apparently stopping at a bus stop in december last year and issued with a £ 70 penalty notice by the local council but mr @entity17 was actually stuck in traffic at the time , which is allowed according to the @entity23 mr @entity12 said : ' it was about 8pm and there was quite a bit of traffic on the road - it ’s a main road and the traffic light was on red			1
' i was about eight cars back from the traffic lights , and at the back of the bus stop - so there will be about three cars in front of me who received tickets too			1
' the photograph showed my car in the bus stop - but it ’s completely out of context , the photo does n’t show that my car was in a long lane of traffic			1
' i ’d never park in a bus stop - on this road it would be stupid to do so , as it ’s such a busy road and the traffic behind you would just be in chaos			1
' after being given the notice mr @entity12 consulted the @entity23 , which states that drivers must not stop ' at or near a bus stop ... except where forced to do so by stationary traffic ' before contacting the council			1
he added : ' they were as unhelpful as unhelpful can be			0
they told me to put my appeal in writing			0
i did that straight away , but after about eight or nine days i still had n’t heard back , so i rung up again			0
' it was then they told me they could send me the footage , so when i eventually saw it , i realised what had happened			0
' i ’m annoyed that it has taken so long			2
it ’s just a money - making scam by the council			2
' i was absolutely seething about what happened			0
it ’s an absolute joke			0
the fact that the officer in the mobile car had given me a fine in the first place is ridiculous			0
mr @entity17 complained to the council , who asked for his appeal in writing , before admitting there had been ' a mistake ' and withdrew the fine mr @entity17 branded the fine ' an absolute joke ' and ' a money - making scam by the council ' ' but there ’s also the fact that two operators had viewed the footage and did n’t think it was worth mentioning that i was n’t breaking the law			1
' after reviewing the decision , the council has now dropped the charge and apologised , admitting that the notice was ' a mistake '			1
in a statement , @entity104 said : ' all images are checked before a @entity107 is issued			0
in this case a mistake was made			0
' when we find out that we have issued a penalty notice in error we cancel it and refund as appropriate			0
' we continue to monitor and review performance regularly to ensure any errors are minimised			0
' the news comes on the same day that it was revealed a @entity118 council made £ 1.6million from issuing 40,000 parking fines in ten streets last year			2
@entity121 handed out 8,964 tickets in @entity123 and raised £ 393,000 in fines , according to figures for last year released by the local authority			2
their second most profitable street - @entity128 - earned the council £ 251,000 from 4,600 parking fines - despite the street being just 540 yards long .			2

@entity17 , 50 , was stuck in traffic in @entity15 in december last year
while *waiting* at red lights he was photographed in front of a bus stop
the council issued him with a £ 70 fine for breaching the @entity23
however mr @entity17 *challenged* the decision , as stopping is permitted as long as you are *prevented* from moving by other traffic
the council has now withdrawn the charge , admitting it was ' a mistake '
