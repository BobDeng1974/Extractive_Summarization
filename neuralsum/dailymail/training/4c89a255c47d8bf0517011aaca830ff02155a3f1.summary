by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 06:35 est , 31 july 2012 a little boy has enjoyed his first game of football with his brothers after surgeons reshaped his skull and put it back together - like a jigsaw			2
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was suffering from a rare condition that meant his skull fused together			1
surgeons had to cut his skull into pieces then put it back together again like a jigsaw to prevent it compressing his brain and growing even more out of shape			1
@entity8 ( left ) is now fit as a fiddle after his major operation to reshape his skull			1
he had to wear a helmet for six months after the surgery ( right ) for six months after surgery @entity8 had to wear a special protective helmet and his home had to be rigged to avoid him running into tables and sharp corners			1
but now the cheeky - faced three - year - old is well enough to play football for the first time with brothers @entity29 , 12 and @entity31 , eight			0
@entity32 and @entity33 were told that if he did n’t have the op there would have been a risk of brain damage in the future , as the skull could begin to crush the brain			1
@entity41 , 38 , said : ' my world crashed around me when we got the diagnosis and i felt sick when i thought about the surgery			0
' we knew there was something wrong since he was born , but we were told it was something he would grow out of and nothing to worry about			2
' it was the hardest decision we had to make to put @entity8 ’s life into the surgeons hands , and was horrible seeing what he had to go through			1
' @entity8 had a distinctive zig - zag scar after his operation ( left )			1
the brave youngster with his father @entity60 ( right ) @entity8 with his family , ( l to @entity63 ) brother @entity31 , 8 , father @entity60 , mother @entity41 and brother @entity29 , 12 on the day after his first birthday @entity8 was diagnosed with the condition , known as @entity66			1
he was immediately referred to @entity67 , where doctors ran a series of tests and x-rays , with an eye examination to check if the brain was already under pressure			0
if the condition had been discovered any later the surgery would have become more complicated , as by the age of two the skull is fully formed			0
happy and healthy : @entity8 's mother said ' i feel so lucky ' his parents were then forced to make the agonising decision whether to put @entity8 through the major surgery , involving cutting his head from ear to ear in a zig zag			2
@entity60 , 44 , a plastics engineer , and @entity41 both stayed with @entity8 at his bedside while he recovered from surgery			2
he had to wear a helmet for six months afterwards as his skull was still extremely fragile , and any bump could have caused serious damage			2
@entity41 , a full - time mother , said : ' we knew there would be a risk of brain damage if he did n’t have the surgery and we did n’t want it to get any worse as he got older			0
' i collapsed into @entity60 when he went into surgery , but i knew deep down it was the right thing to do			0
' the scar looked horrific and when i saw him straight after i just burst into tears because of what he had been through			0
' he still has to go for six monthly check ups , but after everything i feel so lucky he ’s so happy and healthy now			0
' to see him running around with his brothers without a care in the world is incredible			0

@entity8 diagnosed with @entity66 , which effects one in *3,000* children
caused when skull plates fuse too early meaning brain does *n't* have room to grow
