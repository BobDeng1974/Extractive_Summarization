@entity0 is preparing to issue a personal apologise to the @entity2 after he was caught boasting she had ‘ purred down the line ’ when he called to tell her @entity4 had rejected independence			1
the prime minister was said to be ‘ deeply embarrassed ’ last night after he was inadvertently caught on camera discussing the @entity2 ’s reaction to last week ’s referendum			1
his comments were blasted by @entity4 first minister @entity12 , who led the campaign for independence , as ' absolutely pathetic '			1
' that 's absolutely pathetic and he should hang his head in shame			1
' mr @entity0 is in @entity35 for talks at the @entity37 on tackling the rise of @entity40 extremists			1
but sources indicated the prime minister will issue a private apology to her majesty over what experts described as an ‘ extraordinary breach of protocol ’			1
apparently said she had ‘ purred down the line ’ when she was told @entity4 had voted by 55 per cent to 45 to remain part of the @entity52			1
audio experts at the @entity26 , who analysed the footage , claim he then said : ‘ i have never heard someone tear up like that			0
’ other listeners were divided , with some saying mr @entity0 had described the @entity2 as seeming ‘ happy ’ and ‘ grateful ’			1
his comments were blasted by @entity4 first minister @entity12 , who led the campaign for independence , as ' absolutely pathetic ' the astonishing slip came as he chatted with billionaire @entity64 media mogul @entity29 at a trade event in @entity35 yesterday			1
mr @entity0 appeared to be unaware that his conversation with the former @entity35 mayor was being picked up by the microphone of a camera , which was filming the two men walking into the meeting			1
mr @entity0 , smiling broadly , can be heard saying : ‘ the definition of relief , if you are prime minister of the @entity52 , is ringing up @entity2 and saying , “ your majesty , it is all right , it ’s ok			1
she purred down the line			0
’ the prime minister then seems to say : ‘ i ’ve never , i ’ve never heard someone tear up like that ... grateful			1
’ however , other listeners claimed he had said ‘ cheer up ’			0
his comments are embarrassing for the @entity2 , who stuck scrupulously to her constitutional position of not intervening in politics during the referendum campaign			1
the closest she came to a comment was when she urged voters to ‘ think carefully ’ before casting their ballots – interpreted by some as support for a no vote			0
@entity92 last night declined to comment on what it described as a ‘ private conversation ’ with mr @entity29			2
the 38 - second piece of footage was put out on a pool basis to newscasters , but mr @entity0 ’s unguarded remarks were initially picked up by @entity101			2
in the most astonishing remark , mr @entity0 was heard to claim that @entity2 ' purred down the line ' continuing the bizarre train of thought , the prime minister claimed pollsters had given him stomach ulcers in the video recording , @entity0 can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the @entity2			1
he said : ' the definition of relief is being the prime minister of the @entity52 and ringing the @entity2 and saying ' it 's alright , it 's okay '			1
' she purred down the line ... ' but it should never have been that close			0
' it was n't in the end , but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt … ' i 've said i want to find these polling companies and i want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through			1
' it was very nervous moments			0
' by yesterday evening , # purringqueen was trending on @entity135 after the report went viral			0
in an apparent rebuke , a @entity138 spokesman said : ‘ we would never comment on a private conversation between her majesty and the prime minister			1
’ but the @entity2 ’s former press secretary , @entity145 , described mr @entity0 ’s blunder as an astonishing breach of protocol			2
he said : ‘ i find it extraordinary that a prime minister , a head of government , could refer in such a casual way to a conversation he has had with the head of state			1
‘ this is compounded by the fact that the person to whom he is speaking was , to all intents and purposes , a complete stranger			0
‘ @entity2 ’s conversation with her prime ministers are entirely confidential for a very good reason			2
‘ it is the cornerstone of their relationship and the basis on which she can exert her constitutional right to advise , encourage and warn			0
you simply ca n’t afford to have such a casual attitude to this when you are prime minister			2
‘ he , of all people , should have been aware of the cameras and that they could pick his conversation up			0
even @entity177 , for all his bluster , has always kept schtum about the @entity2			2
’ former @entity179 defence minister @entity178 said mr @entity0 ’s slip betrayed an ‘ arrogant and disrespectful ’ attitude			2
he added : ‘ @entity2 worked enormously hard to maintain her neutrality during the referendum campaign despite a great deal of pressure to speak out			2
i am sure the @entity138 will be mortified that her private thoughts have now been blurted out by her own prime minister			1
’ mr @entity0 provoked anger in 2011 when he revealed to mps that prince @entity190 had personally lobbied against cuts to @entity52 ’s air - sea rescue capability			2
but his latest slip is likely to cause much graver offence at the @entity138			2
it could also spark anger among pro-independence @entity4			0
@entity0 claimed @entity2 ' purred down the line ' when he called her to say @entity4 had voted against independence the blunder came after mr @entity29 congratulated mr @entity0 over the outcome of the referendum			1
the first part of the prime minister ’s response is inaudible , but he then says : ‘ it should never have been that close			2
‘ it was n’t in the end , but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt … ’ he is then heard hitting out at the pollsters , who sparked panic in @entity214 by briefly suggesting the @entity216 campaign was on course to win			2
the comments will fuel concerns among @entity221 mps that mr @entity0 panicked and offered major concessions to @entity4 on the basis of one or two rogue polls			1
speaking about his own reaction to the @entity227 vote , mr @entity0 told @entity228 : ‘ i was extremely nervous and worried because i ’m a passionate believer in the @entity52			0
i represent an @entity231 constituency			0
‘ i ’m @entity231 ... i ’m also @entity52 , and i care massively about the potential break - up of our country			0
’ the extraordinary remarks were picked up as mr @entity0 went on a walkabout at the @entity238 headquarters in @entity35 , with the city 's former mayor @entity29 mr @entity0 also vowed to ' sue ' polling companies who suggested the @entity216 campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign , claiming the worry had given him ' stomach ulcers ' @entity4 first minister @entity246 today returned to the @entity247 today , with his deputy @entity248 , for the first time since he saw his dream of independence rejected by voters late on saturday september 6 , details of a @entity255 poll for the @entity256 emerged , putting @entity216 on 51 per cent and @entity227 on 49 per cent prime minister @entity0 has a reputation for speaking before he thinks ' @entity258 is sort of a bunch of ... fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists , mostly			1
' april 2006 ' too many tweets might make a tw * t. ' july 2009 ' calm down dear			0
' april 2011 , to @entity179 mp @entity266 ' when you are left on your own [ parenting ] , it 's a good reminder of how difficult it is to do anything else when looking after a little one because you worry they might drown themselves in the sink whilst you 're having a pee			0
' september 2013 ‘ i do n’t buy the value stuff [ bread ] ... i ’ve got a breadmaker which i delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways			0
' october 2013 ' i 'm a massive fan , i ’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person			0
' december 2013 , on being on @entity288 during a court case where @entity290 was a witness ' i have got a piece of supermarket sociology , which is that there is something about @entity296 customers , is that they are the most talkative			0
i found that if i shop in @entity296 it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you , and have a chat			0
' whereas in other supermarkets i find i can dart round very quickly and get everything			0
it is something about your customers , they are very talkative , engaged people			0
' april 2014 ' i have to say that after the events i ’ve been facing over the past few day , assassination would be a welcome release			0
