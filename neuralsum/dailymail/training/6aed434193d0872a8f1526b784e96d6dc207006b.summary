an @entity1 judge has recommended that a medical custody order that has kept a 27 - year - old insomniac in hospital for seven months should be lifted			1
hunting guide @entity5 was taken to hospital in october last year after he started to hallucinate after not sleeping for 11 days			1
but in november @entity5 was put into protective custody after his parents , @entity10 and @entity11 , and the doctors treating him disagreed about the medication he was being prescribed			1
hope : @entity5 could soon be free of a medical custody order which his family claim has led to him being given strong medication change : @entity5 was working as a hunting guide when he suffered insomnia brought on by steroids he had been prescribed when @entity5 's condition deteriorated , his parents wanted to have power of attorney but a court ruled in favor of the state having protective custody			1
the resulting state guardianship order , which was put into place on november 15 , led to an anxious and lengthy legal battle by his family to gain access to him and have a say in his treatment			2
if the recommendation to end the protective order is agreed by a superior judge , @entity5 will once again have the right to make his own decisions about his medical treatment , as well as personal and financial choices			1
'' he can be his own man again , ' the family 's attorney , @entity41 , told the @entity43 , adding that @entity5 would be released from the care of his state - appointed guardian			1
the 27 - year - old , who worked as a guide in @entity48 , had fallen sick during a hunting trip on october 11			0
he was prescribed anti-anxiety drugs and medication for insomnia , but within a few days he had become unresponsive			0
reunited : @entity53 , pictured right with @entity5 , was prevented from regularly visiting her son family : @entity5 and his father , @entity57 , walk along the corridor of a @entity60 medical center after his mother stole him away from the place where he was being treated it is thought his original case of insomnia was a side effect of steroids he had been prescribed while recovering from an operation			1
by january , doctors said he was suffering from autoimmune encephalitis , in which his immune system was attacking his brain			2
when his parents clashed with doctors over complaints that the drugs he was prescribed were causing him to deteriorate , they had their visits limited to just one hour a day			1
friends of @entity5 described how the practical joker who loved the outdoors quickly became a shell of a man , unable to get up or hold a conversation			2
a picture posted of on the @entity87 in april showed the once fit young man with a face swollen from medication			0
' a picture tells alot ! @entity5 is definately declining on all these drugs , ' the accompanying caption read			2
the situation came to a head shortly after that picture was taken			0
as a hospital worker tried to take @entity5 back to a locked ward in his wheelchair , the young man 's mother , @entity97 , intervened			2
she allegedly pushed the hospital employee aside and fled with her son , according to court documents			0
fun loving : before his insomnia , and seven - month hospital stay , @entity5 was full of life unresponsive : @entity5 went from being an active hunting guide to a shell of his former self progress : the courts have recommended that @entity5 should be allowed to make his own decisions again when mrs @entity53 was arrested at a medical clinic in @entity60 for kidnapping , she told police she had just wanted a second opinion on her son 's condition , the @entity115 reported			1
no formal charges were made against her			0
@entity5 was n't present at his hearing on friday , but he listened into the proceedings on a telephone			0
he is currently staying with family in @entity128			0
after the hearing , his attorney , mr @entity41 said : ' i think all the parties have come to the agreement that @entity5 has regained capacity - thanks be to @entity135 - and he is now ready to reenter society as the young man he was before he had a guardian placed over him last fall			0
' @entity5 's mother added that her son was happy to have his rights back , and said : ' he 's doing great , able to make his own decisions ... i â€™m just happy , really happy			0
