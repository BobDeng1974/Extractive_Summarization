among some of his lines : ' there is a line on her chin that bothers me ' , ' her hips exceed her shoulders ' , and ' her arms are blotchy '			2

in @entity23 ' case , @entity62 posted a photo of her on december 7 , 2009			2
the post , submitted by someone who knows her , called her a ' dirty @entity4 cheerleader '			0
it claimed that her ex-boyfriend contracted chlamydia and gonorrhea after cheating on her with more than 50 women , and that he likely gave it to @entity23			0
tv star : former @entity119 cheerleader , @entity16 , pictured , who carried out a sordid affair with one of her 17 - year - old high school students is set to get her own reality tv show @entity62 , a 33 - year - old married father of a one - year - old girl , said the only thing he wrote about @entity23 was , ' why are all high school teachers freaks in the sack ? ' ' it 's sad that i will be sitting in a courtroom in front of a jury who will decide how many millions of dollars i need to pay a convicted criminal who had sex with an underage boy if i lose , ' @entity62 told @entity135			1
' @entity16 has lied to the world over and over again			1
nobody can tell when she is telling the truth			0
even her mother told @entity140 how @entity16 is an amazing actress , ' @entity62 said			1
' i feel like i 'm being extorted by @entity16 and her lawyers			1
' this just defines who her true character is and how she manipulates people into believing that she is someone she is not			1
' she got off @entity148 , ' he said			0
' if she was a male teacher she would be in jail right now			1
there is a double standard and that 's not fair			0
' if @entity23 ' lawsuit succeeds and is awarded a large sum of money , other websites including @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 could be bombarded with lawsuits over material posted by their users			0
' it opens the floodgates , ' said @entity62 's @entity168 - area lawyer , @entity167 , who has successfully argued dozens of similar cases across the country			1
' it would basically destroy the ability of websites like @entity155 that allow users to post comments			0
... once you strip away their immunity , once you make it conditional , you open the door to allow them to get sued			0
' @entity167 said those websites and @entity62 's are clearly protected under the federal @entity183			0
passed in 1995 by @entity185 , the law was designed in part to provide immunity to website publishers from liability for content that comes from third parties			0
happy : the couple are now free to talk openly about their relationship after @entity16 , center , pleaded guilty to having sex with @entity197 , left , when he was 17 and her student @entity23 ' attorney , @entity200 , said @entity62 could be responsible for the entire post involving his client because he has n't said who submitted it and will argue that the @entity183 does n't protect @entity10			1
' unlike social media sites such as @entity155 or @entity156 that allow someone to put up something and they do n't comment about it , @entity62 personally acts as the editor in determining what goes up , ' he said			0
' it 's nothing more than an electronic newspaper that peddles smut			0
' @entity62 , who has been sued 17 times over his posts , defends the site as a form of entertainment , created to be a sort - of @entity222 for non-celebrities who crave attention or present themselves as perfect			1
' the site was created to make people laugh and give them an escape from their job and see people they know , not @entity228 and @entity229 and the same regurgitated celebrity stuff , but the pseudo-celebrities in their town , who go out to the clubs , the popular kids , ' he said			0
' it 's not intended to harm people			0
' @entity167 said nearly all 17 lawsuits were settled after @entity62 agreed to take down a given post ; he lost only one because a business partner did n't fight it			1
as for the ' freak in the sack ' comment , @entity167 said he can argue that it 's the truth			0
clueless : @entity251 said he had no idea his wife was cheating on him during his short - lived marriage but as one of the cheerleaders for the @entity119 she had ample opportunity to be away from home to do that , he 'll draw on text messages @entity23 exchanged with the student			1
the messages are under a court seal , but @entity167 has access to them as part of the lawsuit			0
' she testified under oath that she was not a freak in the sack , but anyone who reads these text messages would not agree with that conclusion			0
they 're extremely , extremely graphic , ' he said			0
' based on the contents of the messages , she acknowledged that she was , quote , " a freak in the sack "			0
' @entity23 admitted in court to having sex with the student in february 2011 , when she was 26			1
the teen had been in @entity23 ' freshman @entity284 class in 2008 , and she was his peer tutor in 2010 and 2011 before he graduated last year , according to a plea agreement signed by @entity23 â€” a move that allowed her to avoid jail time			1
the day after , @entity23 and the student sat down with @entity290 's @entity140 and said they were still in a relationship , in love and did n't care what other people thought			2
@entity62 's post about @entity23 came more than two years before her relationship with the student , and @entity200 argues that they caused her severe emotional distress and prompted her to quit her teaching job			2
@entity23 resigned as a teacher at @entity304 and from the @entity4 cheer squad in late 2011 after four years with both jobs			2
@entity200 said at the time that @entity23 had done nothing wrong and stepped down because a rumor that she had become involved with a student became too much			2
it was reported last year that she was set to get her own reality show after the creators of @entity315 , @entity316 , reportedly approached the @entity13 woman about the program			2
she said of their relationship : ' the truth will set you free			0
the stress fell off of me when i did n't have to hide anymore			0
if you can love someone at their lowest , that says a lot ' student : @entity197 has spoken out for the first time since the case came to light and said he ' loves everything ' about his teacher the show will centre around ms @entity16 and presumably @entity197 , her much younger boyfriend			1
the cheerleader 's ex-husband @entity251 and his family have hit out at plans for the show , which is scheduled to air on the cable channel @entity341			0
mr @entity251 's father , @entity342 , said his son found the idea ' obscene ' and claimed that it sent out the wrong message			0
' i know how @entity251 feels about this and it is just obscene , ' he told @entity350			0
' it is just disgusting that she is going to make money after telling so many lies and ruining my son 's life			0
' the sex scandal has turned into ' one big payday ' for ms @entity16 , according to @entity135			1
' a lot of people are going to be outraged i imagine when they find out she 's getting a show , ' a source told the website			0
' she is basically being rewarded for breaking the law ! ' she 's totally cashing in on her crime , and i 'm pretty sure that if it was a 27 - year - old man that had pleaded guilty to having sex with his 17 - year - old female student he would n't have been given a tv show ! ' resemblance ? the @entity375 cheerleader 's ex-husband @entity251 , left , and her new love @entity197 , right sour : @entity23 ' ex-husband , @entity251 , admitted in @entity379 to threatening to break her neck			1
