@entity0 has just two ‘ ebola - proof ’ hospital beds , @entity2 has learnt			1
official guidance states that patients with the highly infectious disease – which has no vaccine , no cure and kills up to 90 per cent of victims – should be treated in specially built units that are biologically secure			1
yet there is only one operational @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in the @entity0 , at the @entity12 in @entity13			1
a second , at the @entity16 in @entity17 , is ‘ being redeveloped ’ according to @entity18			1
it has an array of equipment to ensure the patient did not pass on the killer virus an ambulance arrives with @entity28 victim dr. @entity27 , pictured right , to @entity30 , in @entity31			0
dr @entity27 , infected with the ebola virus in @entity34 arrived in @entity31 for treatment on saturday should @entity0 have more than two ebola patients at any one time , they will have to be treated in less secure hospital side rooms			1
dr @entity39 , an infectious diseases consultant at the @entity12 , said there would be ‘ no other option ’ but to treat ebola patients in standard isolation rooms			1
he said : ‘ we think it is highly unlikely , but if we had more than two patients we would have to treat them in our normal isolation facilities			0
they are not to the same standard but we are confident we could prevent spread			0
’ the @entity11 , he said , had an array of equipment to ensure a patient did not pass on the killer virus , including air - lock doors and ‘ negative pressure ’ air flow to make sure nothing escapes from the unit			2
the patient is kept in a sealed plastic tent , with arm mouldings so doctors and nurses can treat them without any physical contact			0
the tent is burnt after use in dedicated incinerators			0
guidance issued by the @entity70 and the @entity71 in 2012 states that patients with confirmed viral haemorrhagic fever – of which ebola is the most deadly type – ‘ should be managed in an @entity11 ’ to ‘ eliminate or minimise the risk of transmission to health care workers ’			1
dr. @entity27 working at an ebola treatment clinic in @entity81 , @entity82			0
@entity27 and @entity83 contracted the disease while working there			0
he arrived back in the @entity86 on saturday for treatment @entity86 : the biologically secure unit in @entity31 , where charity volunteer dr @entity27 , 33 , who contracted the disease in @entity82 , will be treated			1
charity worker @entity83 , 60 , also contracted ebola while in the country @entity82 : masked medics deal with the epidemic			0
according to the latest figures from the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , there have been 729 deaths from 1,329 confirmed cases of ebola in this year 's epidemic it warns that it can ‘ spread readily within a hospital setting ’ , ‘ has a high case - fatality rate ’ , and ‘ is difficult to recognise and detect rapidly ’			1
an @entity18 spokesman said it was ‘ hypothetical ’ to talk about @entity0 having more ebola cases than @entity11 beds , as there are no confirmed cases in the country			1
but the situation can change rapidly			0
@entity86 charity volunteers dr @entity27 , 33 , and @entity83 , 60 , have contracted the virus in @entity82			0
dr @entity27 arrived back in the @entity86 yesterday to be treated at a special secure unit in @entity31 , @entity116			2
for now , ms @entity83 remains in @entity82			0
@entity0 , like the @entity86 , has dozens of volunteers on the ebola frontline in the @entity34 countries of @entity82 , @entity120 and @entity121			2
@entity82 living outside @entity122 stage a protest against using their community to bury dead victims of the virus @entity82 military police are deployed at the burial site for victims of the ebola virus in @entity131 outside @entity122 , where youths were staging a protest against being used to bury the dead according to the latest figures from the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , there have been 729 deaths from 1,329 confirmed cases of ebola in this year ’s epidemic , the largest number ever known			1
on friday , @entity96 director general dr @entity142 said ebola was spreading ‘ faster than our efforts to control it ’			0
the @entity148 refused to confirm if @entity0 citizens who contract the virus abroad would be flown back for treatment , saying only : ‘ procedures are in place but we are not going to speculate on what we would do in any individual case			2
’ with up to 10,000 passengers flying into @entity0 airports every week on 30 direct flights from @entity34 , @entity159 , the @entity161 mp and chairman of the @entity163 , said the country should not wait for its ‘ first taste of ebola ’ before taking tough action			1
epidemic : the ebola virus , which has killed more than 700 people so far			0
on friday , @entity96 director general dr @entity142 said ebola was spreading ' faster than our efforts to control it ' he wants ministers to consider introducing fever - screening cameras at @entity0 airports			1
@entity177 , which has fewer direct flights from the region than the @entity0 , introduced infra - red thermal imaging cameras at two major airports in april , in an early response to the ebola threat			1
last week @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity184 , and @entity185 said they would be introducing temperature screening at airports			2
however critics say the cameras pick up lots of ‘ false positives ’ – including people with minor illnesses and those who are hot after a dash through the airport			0
mr @entity159 said : ‘ as far as i ’m concerned any measures – including additional screening – which are felt necessary to reassure the public should be taken			2
‘ prevention is always better than cure : we do n’t want to have our first taste of ebola before taking action			0
’ a spokesman for @entity18 said : ‘ there are currently no known cases of ebola in the @entity0 , but we are confident that we have robust arrangements in place should that situation change			2
‘ the @entity12 can routinely manage two ebola patients			2
there are arrangements to increase this capacity quickly should this be required			0
the new @entity11 at the @entity16 at @entity17 is being redeveloped , but the infectious diseases unit remains open and ready to play a role			1

guidance states patients should be treated in biologically secure units
only such @entity0 unit in operation is at the @entity12 in @entity13
a second at the @entity16 in @entity17 is ' being redeveloped '
@entity159 wants to consider introducing fever - screening cameras at airports
there are no confirmed cases of the deadly virus in the country
