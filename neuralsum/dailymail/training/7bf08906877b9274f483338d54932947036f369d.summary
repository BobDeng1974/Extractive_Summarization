by @entity0 the dingo has been known as @entity3 ’s native dog since the arrival of westerners more than 200 years ago			1
but now the country has redefined a wildlife icon as scientists have said that the dingo is a unique species and not just a common mutt			0
a new study has resurrected the species name @entity14 dingo , which was first mentioned by a @entity17 naturalist called @entity18 in 1793			0
distinctive : the dingo is a unique species and not a common mutt , scientists have said			0
the dingo will now officially use its species name @entity14 dingo , which was first mentioned by a @entity17 naturalist called @entity18 in 1793 ‘ the dingo is distinct from what we describe as a domestic dog ; it 's a distinct form of canid , ’ said @entity27 , a @entity28 ( @entity28 ) ecologist			1
confusion over whether or not the dingo was a distinct species partly originates from the scientific classification of the @entity3 dingo , which was based on a simple drawing and description in the journal of @entity3 ’s first governor , @entity42 , without reference to a physical specimen			1
to find a specimen of a dingo unlikely to have cross-bred with domestic dogs , the researchers searched museum collections in @entity50 , @entity3 and @entity51 that contained specimens known or likely to pre-date 1900			1
they examined 69 skull specimens and six skin specimens to create a benchmark description of the dingo , whose defining physical features include a relatively broad head with a long snout , as well as erect ears and a bushy tail			1
the description features in a study published in the @entity64			0
it is thought that dingoes were introduced to @entity3 between three and five thousand years ago , with genetic evidence suggesting they originate from @entity70 domestic dogs			2
the animals bred in isolation until the arrival of domestic dogs after @entity50 settlement			0
an @entity77 artist is pictured with a painting of a dingo ‘ now any wild canid – dingo , dog , or hybrid of the two – can be judged against that classification , ’ says dr @entity80 , lead author of the study , from the @entity83 ’s @entity82			1
‘ we can also conclusively say that the dingo is a distinctive @entity3 wild canid or member of the dog family in its own right , separate from dogs and wolves			1
the appropriate scientific classification is @entity14 dingo , as they appear not to be descended from wolves , are distinct from dogs and are not a subspecies , ’ he said			2
many @entity3 like to think that dingoes are always yellow , but dr @entity27 said : ‘ one of our insights is that coat colour does not define an animal as a dingo , dog or a hybrid			1
we found that dingoes can be tan , dark , black and tan , white , or can have the sable coloration typical of @entity117 dogs			0
' dingoes are @entity3 ’s largest land predator and play an important role in regulating populations of species such as kangaroos , wallabies and invasive red foxes			2
the scientists believe that a clearer understanding of dingo numbers , based on the clearer identification , will improve understanding of their role in biodiversity			0
dr @entity80 said : ‘ distinguishing dingoes from their hybrids ( cross-breeds ) with feral dogs is a practical concern			1
current policies in parts of @entity3 support the conservation of dingoes but the extermination of “ dingo - dogs , ” which are considered a major pest because they kill livestock			2
’ it is thought that dingoes were introduced to @entity3 between three and five thousand years ago , with genetic evidence suggesting they originate from east @entity70 domestic dogs			2
the animals bred in isolation until the arrival of domestic dogs after @entity50 settlement			0
‘ that made distinguishing dingoes from dogs problematic , as the dna tests and analyses of their physical structure were based on dingoes whose ancestry was not known			0
they were either captive animals or wild animals of uncertain ancestry , ’ dr @entity80 explained .			0

scientists at the @entity83 and the @entity28 looked at the skulls of dingoes predating 1900
from this they came up with a benchmark description for the species
they discovered that defining physical features of the dingo include a broad head , long snout , erect ears and a bushy tail
the dingo is an @entity3 wild canid or member of the dog family in its own right , separate from dogs and wolves
scientists will use the clearer classification to differentiate between pure dingoes , which are *protected* and feral dogs , which are not
