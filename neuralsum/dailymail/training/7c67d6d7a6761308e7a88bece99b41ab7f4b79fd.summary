by @entity0 and @entity1 business secretary @entity2 says headhunters should submit all - women shortlists of candidates for top jobs to solve @entity8 ¿ s chronic shortage of female executives headhunters should submit all - women shortlists of candidates for top jobs to solve @entity8 ’s chronic shortage of female executives , @entity2 said yesterday			1
just one in five top jobs in the @entity15 index of the @entity8 ’s 100 biggest public companies are held by women			1
yesterday the business secretary slammed @entity19 , the mining giant , for failing to have even a single woman in its boardroom			1
it is the only company left in the @entity15 to still be an all - male club , but has finally pledged to sold the problem by hiring a female director by the end of the year			1
speaking to @entity28 on @entity29 , mr @entity2 said the lack of women at @entity19 is ‘ a bit of a disgrace , to be frank ’			1
later , when asked about headhunters being able to put forward all - women shortlists , he said : ‘ you know , we ’d like to see that happening			2
’ under the government ’s voluntary code , 25 per cent of directors in the @entity15 should be women by 2015			1
when lord @entity43 established the code in 2011 , the figure was just 12.5 per cent , but the latest figures show it has jumped to 20.7 per cent			0
the attitude of some senior men to female colleagues offers an insight into why so many women are being held back in their careers , and doing jobs which are beneath them			2
just four years ago , there were 21 companies in the @entity15 which had no women in their boardroom , compared to only one today			1
@entity57 , the former @entity19 chairman , said in 2011 : ‘ women are quite as intelligent as men			1
‘ they have a tendency not to be so involved quite often and they ’re not so ambitious in business as men because they ’ve better things to do			0
in march , a report , commissioned by the government , said all shortlists should include the name of at least one ¿ strongly recommended woman ¿			0
file picture ‘ quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things			0
‘ all these things have unintended consequences			0
pregnant ladies have nine months off			0
‘ do you think that means that when i rush out , what i ’m absolutely desperate to have is young women who are about to get married in my company , and that i really need them on board because i know they ’re going to get pregnant and they ’re going to go off for nine months ? ’ mr @entity2 said the changes at @entity19 are ‘ long overdue ’ , but went onto criticise the firm for the fact that it has ‘ consistently failed to act ’			1
he said : ‘ the vast majority of @entity8 ’s top companies have got the message that a diverse top management team is good for business			0
‘ it is simply not credible that one company can not find any suitable women			2
’ in march , a report , commissioned by the government , said all shortlists should include the name of at least one ‘ strongly recommended woman ’			0
the report , written by the headhunter @entity103 , also called for further investigation into the legality of putting forward women - only shortlists for jobs			2
the @entity109 is currently investigating the ‘ legality ’ of such lists , already used by the @entity112 for selecting new mps			0
the commission expects to publish its guidance this summer .			0
