barn owls : the iconic bird has seen its population tumble in recent decades , with some estimates putting numbers at fewer than 4,000 in @entity1 barn owls have staged a strong comeback thanks to the glorious weather , after their numbers slumped alarmingly following last year ’s poor summer			2
this year , experts are celebrating record numbers of eggs and chicks in nests which are monitored through the breeding season			2
the iconic bird has seen its population tumble in recent decades , with some estimates putting numbers at fewer than 4,000 in @entity1			0
but this summer ’s excellent breeding rates are raising hopes that the barn owls have turned a corner and the population will climb			0
@entity251 , of @entity253 monitoring group the @entity254 , said : ‘ what a difference a year makes			0
‘ there was a good year in 2012 when surveys concluded that 72 barn owl chicks fledged from the boxes that were monitored by our group			0
‘ but this was followed by a disastrous year in 2013 when no breeding was found at all , even though the number of boxes was approximately unchanged at 120			0
’ he added : ‘ morale in the group was at an all - time low and there were mutterings that it would take a decade for the barn owl population to recover			0
‘ but the 2013 - 14 winter was exceptionally mild and this enabled short - tailed voles , one of their main prey , to start breeding exceptionally early			0
‘ at the time of writing , 118 chicks had been found , by far a record for the group ... it is clear we are seeing a remarkable exhibition of the resilience of nature			0
’ barn owls have also been breeding in record numbers in the @entity288 and @entity289 in @entity290 following a disastrous year for them last year			0
today : low cloud and mist in some eastern areas at first			0
slowly brightening up , although staying locally dull and cool on some eastern coasts into the afternoon			0
elsewhere , generally dry with sunny periods but isolated afternoon showers in the east			1
tonight : any showers in the east dying away this evening , then generally dry with clear periods overnight			0
low cloud again returning to some eastern areas and also affecting some western coasts			0
tuesday : early cloud breaking up with most places having a dry day with sunny periods and occasional cloudier spells			1
a few rogue showers may develop in the north and west			0
wednesday to friday : plenty of dry and fine weather with sunny periods			1
some showers in the south and west from thursday these locally heavy and thundery			0
very warm , locally hot in the south			2
friday to sunday : there is likely to be plenty of fine and dry weather around , especially across the northern half of the @entity1			1
more showery conditions generally affecting southern parts , which potentially could be heavy and thundery at times			0
temperatures remaining warm or very warm for many across the @entity1 and perhaps locally hot in places			1
sea breezes could keep some coastal parts a little fresher though			0
monday , july 28 to sunday , august 3 , 2014 : currently there are signs of @entity333 frontal systems moving in from the west , bringing spells of more persistent rain , mainly to northwestern parts , interspersed with brighter , but showery conditions			2
whilst probably drier and warmer in the south			0
temperatures also gradually returning to near or a little above normal			0
monday , august 4 to monday , august 18 , 2014 : at the start of the period , the favoured scenario is for northern and western parts to be affected by spells of rain at times whilst southern , eastern and central regions have the best chance of more prolonged fine weather , though even here some rain or showers are possible			1
with time , it looks likely that all areas will turn generally more unsettled although there will still be some drier and brighter spells			0
despite this , there is a signal for temperatures remaining warm , with some muggy nights to come			2
towards the end of the period , the weather looks likely to become more settled again with some dry , fine and sunny conditions			1
it also looks likely to be warm , especially in the north and east			0
