is @entity1 right to be angry over birthday snub ? @entity4 's agent has claimed the midfielder could quit @entity6 this summer , with the @entity8 feeling the club is not giving him enough attention			1
@entity4 has backed @entity12 's bizarre attack on @entity6 for forgetting the midfielder 's birthday and says he will clarify his future after the @entity16			1
@entity12 told @entity17 : ' if you ask 100 per cent or 50 - 50 [ if @entity4 will stay ] , better 50 - 50 than 100			1
normally everything is good , yes they win @entity36			0
@entity12 said that the club should have given @entity4 a prize after he missed out on the @entity40 award to @entity41			1
' okay , @entity41 wins best player , his decision is his decision			2
but @entity1 did not win			0
normally the club must say something , make a prize to him , something a little bit more , like ' @entity1 you had a great season ' or something special , a cake			1
when asked if @entity27 are a possible destination for @entity4 this summer , @entity12 said : ' @entity27 we know are a former club of @entity1 , and all the staff at @entity27 , and players , liked him and supported us			1
he had a great time there and it ’s like another home for him			0
' it 's possible to find solutions , and the player will be happy			2
it 's not a question of money or no money			0
always more attention must be given to player , more motivation for the future			2
this is my opinion and the opinion of course of @entity1			0
no respect : @entity12 says @entity6 should have given @entity4 a prize for missing out on the @entity40 award to @entity41 having their cake and eating it : @entity82 celebrates @entity6 's title win ' of course it 's not the question of money , it 's more importantly about the relationship			1
normally everything is good , yes they win @entity36			0
' when he plays in the team , like any player , he says " i will be in team where the team loves me , if people or supporters do n't love me i can leave			1
" ' this is very important because he fights for @entity6 but he fights for @entity6 and they do n't fight for him			2

somebody in their job , in newspaper or in radio , if the company will shake his hand and congratulate him on his birthday he will be happier and life will be better and nicer			0
' if people do n't give attention to us we will forget about these peopole and work with other people			1
' some people can say what they want , but i tell you this is not about cake , more importantly it is about attention			2
@entity1 can buy cake for everybody and it 's no problem from him			0
' believe me , i bought him everything [ for his birthday ]			0
' and @entity4 earlier tweeted : ' my agent was trying to make a point here on my behalf , joke @entity155 seems important for me to make a statement			2

' @entity162 said is true			0
i will give an interview after world cup to explain			0
' how sweet : @entity166 sent @entity4 this happy birthday message on @entity127 sound investment : @entity6 signed @entity4 from @entity27 for £ 24m in 2010			1

@entity170 says @entity4 is ' more 50 - 50 than 100 per cent ' likely to be at the club next season
@entity12 also says @entity6 should have given @entity4 a cake when he missed out on @entity40 to @entity41
' if people do n't give attention to us then we will forget about these people and work with others , ' said @entity12
@entity4 could leave @entity6 in the summer after being upset by the ' sick ' *incident* , where the club did not wish him a happy 31st birthday
@entity12 says @entity82 had a ' 100kg cake ' after winning title
he also claims @entity6 showed @entity4 a lack of respect
@entity12 says @entity6 congratulating midfielder on @entity127 was ' a joke '
however , video shows @entity6 players singing @entity197 on plane
