the research was compiled by analysing 470 influential men , their different career paths and the fuzz that gets the vote			0
hair we go : academics ( left ) prefer a clean - shaven look , but not as much as the kings of the boardroom ( right ) they ’ve divided the nation ’s men into six types - mr @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , wordsmiths and the @entity40 – and found that the length of facial hair each prefers varies remarkably			1
the hipsters - musicians , actors and those in the advertising world – tend to neglect their razor blades			2

the @entity40 is more likely to stay hair - free on his face ( left ) while hipsters normally opt for a beard ( right ) academics tend to prefer a clean - shaven look , too , with 73 per cent of our top professors choosing to keep their visages follicle - free and 63 per cent of men with the highest iqs opting for the same style			1
wordsmiths , such as authors and journalists , and the everymen , such as office workers or skilled labourers , also shun beards			0
