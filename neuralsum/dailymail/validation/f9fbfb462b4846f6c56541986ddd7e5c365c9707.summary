it will take up to two weeks before doctors know if either of the embryos has successfully embedded and she is pregnant			0
she said : ' some people may think that what i 'm doing is wrong , as i 'd only met the couple in the flesh just 12 hours before having the @entity54 , but i do n't believe it is at all			2
' ideally , i would have spent more time getting to know them			0
there would n't normally be such a rush , but i 'd been having this treatment for another couple who pulled out of the surrogacy with no real reason , which has left me devastated			2
' i did n't want to lose out on the chance to have another surrogate baby for a couple , as i 'm now 48 years old			2
and it seemed such a wasted opportunity when i could use my womb again to help others			0

' at the time i said he was going to be my last , but having babies is addictive , ' she said yesterday			2
' the thought i could be pregnant again is incredibly exciting – it 's the beginning of a journey with the couple which culminates in a magical moment when i give birth			1
' if one or both of the embryos implant into her womb 's lining , the baby – or babies – will be born by caesarean section , as with her last two pregnancies			0
miss @entity10 , who also owns a £ 350,000 , six - bedroom farmhouse in @entity110 , said : ' i 'll be 49 when i give birth , which is not so strange and well within the realms of getting pregnant naturally , let alone with @entity54			1
' i love being pregnant , although i hope it is just one this time			0
with two embryos there is a chance it could be twins			0
and i really do n't want to contemplate triplets or quads at my age – i 've done triplets once and that was enough ! ' she followed the couple 's story on the surrogacy forum for several months and said her ' heart went out to them ' but that she was unable to help as she was already partnered with another couple			2
when that fell through , it was ' almost fate ' that she could step in – although she did not even know how old the mother - to - be was before agreeing to carry her baby			1
