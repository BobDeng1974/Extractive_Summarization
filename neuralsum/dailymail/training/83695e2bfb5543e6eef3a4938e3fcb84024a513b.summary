by @entity0 , science correspondent lovers of organic chocolate will find this hard to swallow – but there is no evidence that it is any better for the environment than conventional bars			0
@entity8 scientists say organic farming clearly helps wildlife threatened by intensive agriculture in developed countries			2
however , the jury is still out on the @entity14 where virgin land may be cleared for crops such as cocoa beans and bananas			1
while organic chocolate is a popular choice , it could be having a negative impact on @entity14 countries this land is likely to be home to more plants , animals and other wildlife when wild then when farmed			1
and as organic farms often need more land than conventional ones , organic chocolate may not be as green as believed			2
@entity33 , of @entity8 ’s department of plant sciences , said : ‘ more research is needed on the impact of farming in tropical and subtropical regions			0
‘ for example , there are no studies on organic bananas or cocoa beans , two of the most popular organic products found in @entity48 supermarkets			1
‘ at present , we simply can not say whether buying organic bananas or chocolate has any environmental benefit			0
’ dr @entity33 spoke out after crunching together data from almost 100 studies into the wildlife present on different types of farm			0
almost 80 per cent of organic farming happens in less developed nations , but almost no data exists about the impact of organic farming in these countries on average , organic farms , which typically grow their crops without the aid of pesticides , artificial fertilisers and intensive farming techniques had a 34 per cent more species of plants , insects and birds than conventional farms			1
in some cases , the increase in biodiversity , or number of species , was as high as 43 per cent			0
writing in the @entity79 , dr @entity33 and colleague @entity80 said : ‘ organic farming is a tried and tested method for increasing biodiversity on farmlands and may help reverse the declines of formerly common species in developed nations			1
’ however , most of the data came from the @entity48 , despite three - quarters of organic farming done elsewhere and dr @entity33 said we can not assume the same applies all over the world			1
the @entity92 said that organic farming brings other benefits , such as a drop in the use of toxic pesticides			2
it added that large - scale studies have shown that the practice has ‘ huge benefits ’ in developing countries .			0

chocolate and bananas are two most popular organic products
however they are mostly produced in the @entity14
almost all data on the impact of organic farming *focuses* on @entity48
organic farms take up more space so they could be *harming* less developed nations where it is likely that wild land was cleared for crops
