@entity0 , 29 , was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer one and a half weeks ago @entity0 was in high spirits when she visited her local gp with stomach cramps , having just returned from a nine month trip around @entity6 with her partner			1
but the remainder of the 29 - year - old 's travel plans were instantly cut short only three weeks ago , after a couple of blood tests led to the detection of a growth in her liver			1
ms @entity0 , who formerly worked as a journalist for the @entity18 in @entity19 , was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer within weeks of the discovery			1
with doctors unable to predict how much time she has left , ms @entity0 is determined to make the most of her life , proposing to her partner of four and a half years , @entity28 , 28			2
' it was n't a proposal in the true sense , ' ms @entity0 told @entity32			2
' if i had n't been diagnosed i 'm not sure we would have gotten married yet because we had other things that we wanted to do first like travelling and buying an apartment			0
' it 's one of those things that i always thought i 'd be able to do and because the doctors do n't know what kind of time frame they 're looking at , it was something that i could do when other things had been taken away from me			0
' it will be a nice distraction , something to look forward to and think about instead of thinking about the chemotherapy … it 's an opportunity for us to celebrate our life together and just forget about it for one night			0
' the former @entity18 journalist , who displayed no symptoms other than stomach cramps , proposed to her partner of four and a half years , @entity28 ( left ) , whom she plans to wed in january next year @entity55 ( left ) , set up a donations page where $ 9000 has already been raised for ms @entity0 's wedding since the page was set up four days ago a donation page for the couple 's january wedding , which was secretly set up by ms @entity0 's close friend @entity55 to help them as they direct their savings to medical costs , has already raised almost $ 9000 since it was set up four days ago			1
' i had a list of our friends and colleagues to contact to tell them the news and each person was so shocked and one of the things they all said was " what can we do ? how can we help her right now ? " and i said " well , actually one of things that she talked to me about was that she and her partner were hoping to get married " , ' ms @entity55 told @entity32			0
but ms @entity0 , who still shows no symptoms of her cancer other than occasional mild stomach pain , has also taken it upon herself to use her story as an example and encourage others to undertake regular blood analyses			1
' if i had n't happened to go in and get a blood test i never would 've have found it and i 'd be living in ignorance until it really was too late			0
it could be the thing to save your life or give you a bit more time , ' ms @entity0 said			2
ms @entity55 ( right ) with ms @entity0 and @entity99 at a @entity101 party said she set up the donations page for her friend after their mutual friends kept asking how they could help ' if i had n't happened to go in and get a blood test i never would 've have found it and i 'd be living in ignorance until it really was too late			1
it could be the thing to save your life or give you a bit more time , ' ms @entity0 , who lives a healthy lifestyle , said ' i never really realised something was wrong , i just went to my gp with stomach cramps i 'd had and i went in thinking i had indigestion problems or something minor			1
' but two blood tests revealed the journalist had poor liver results , leading to a ct scan that showed a huge growth in the vital organ			1
' that was the first time that we knew something was wrong , but at that point not even my doctor realised how bad it was and still thought it could be a benign tumour or a weird growth			0
it just snowballed from there , ' ms @entity0 said			2
ms @entity0 's first indication of a problem came after two blood tests showed poor liver function a ct scan then showed a huge growth in her liver			1
soon after , she underwent keyhole surgery in order to send a sample of her tissue to a lab for testing			0
a laparoscopy , in which a camera was inserted into her stomach , finally confirmed she had terminal liver cancer she was immediately admitted to hospital where she underwent numerous ct scans and @entity156 as well as keyhole surgery in order to send a sample of her tissue to a lab for testing			2
a laparoscopy , in which a camera was inserted into her stomach , finally confirmed she had terminal liver cancer			0
' but it 's a secondary liver cancer which means it 's starting somewhere else and spreading to my liver , ' ms @entity0 explained			1
' but they do n't know where the source is yet or whether they 'll ever know			0
if they know the source the chemotherapy can be more targeted and there 's more chance of it helping or being successful			0
' despite only learning of her exact diagnosis one and a half weeks ago and preparing to undergo six weeks of chemotherapy next monday , ms @entity0 says she ca n't help but feel somewhat grateful			1
she will undergo six weeks of chemotherapy next week , however doctors have been unable to determine how much time she has left ' as you 'd expect the first few days [ after being diagnosed ] were pretty emotional , but there are mixed emotions			0
' you feel a sense of despair that you ca n't describe , but there 's also an element of gratefulness that you have time to do more things – it 's not like i 'm in pain or had any symptoms or anything , which is why it has come as such a shock			0
' i feel as normal as i ever did , i just have it in the back of my mind now that this is growing inside of me			0
' ms @entity0 encourages anyone affected by cancer who is seeking counselling , support or even financial assistance , to contact the @entity210			2
