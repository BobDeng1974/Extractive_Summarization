by @entity0 this was the terrifying moment a boy racer lost control of his @entity5 at an unauthorised ' car cruise ' and ploughed into a crowd of spectators			1
witnesses say the young driver was allegedly trying to impress spectators by pulling off a huge wheel spin at a @entity14 car park in @entity15 , @entity16 , when he injured 17 people			1
horrifying mobile phone footage shows the car suddenly shooting forward and veering off the makeshift drag strip			1
the teenager said she remembers crashing into the windscreen but can not recall anything else about the accident			2
she said : ' we were watching all the cars and i remember feeling really dizzy , like i 'd been hit by something and opening my eyes and loads of people crowding around me and leaning over me and taking pictures			0
' i have got to go back and have my arm checked but it 's just a case of waiting for it to heal - i think i 'm pretty lucky really			0
' the incident took place on saturday night when a huge crowd , including kids in prams , met up for an unauthorised cruise , or a ' car meet ' , which was organised via @entity31			1
drivers took turns to show off their ' static techniques ' , where they rev their engines and spin their wheels on the spot to produce a huge cloud of smoke			0
chief inspector @entity73 said the events were a legal gathering of car enthusiasts but the injuries had been a cause for concern @entity80 said on @entity31 : ' we wish all those involved last night a speedy recovery			1
' the cruise is so people can see all the cars out there and not for people to try and act [ like ] idiots			0
' chief inspector @entity73 , head of local policing in @entity15 , said : ' the events are a legal gathering of members of the public who are car enthusiasts			2
' we have no concern with people viewing cars but clearly when injuries are caused that causes us concern			0
the damaged @entity5 , which appears to have been customised , was stopped by police officers after the spectators were injured @entity37 , 16 , was one of the spectators mowed to the ground after the car veered into the crowd during the event on saturday ' these have been going on for some time without an incident and so , as a result , policing has reduced on them because we have n't had an issue			1
' now , we will look at any future car cruises we have in the city and will police them appropriately to reduce this risk of injury			0
' @entity14 said the gathering had taken place ' without the knowledge or consent ' of the company or the landlord who owns the site and car park			0
car cruising usually involves groups of people gathering in car parks to watch drivers speeding , driving in convoy , racing other vehicles and performing stunts			2
