by @entity0 @entity1 faces trouble on both sides of the @entity4 today following claims the @entity6 has 80,000 @entity8 emails in their possession while a corporate probe into the company continues to gather pace			1
according to reports , the @entity6 has copies of at least 80,000 emails - all of which are said to have been taken from the servers at @entity8 , mr @entity1 's parent company , in @entity19			1
the messages were not included in evidence submitted during the @entity24 phone hacking trial - and so could not be reported until the jury reached its verdicts , it is claimed			1
it is currently unknown what the messages contain - or what the @entity6 is planning to do with them			2
a spokesman for the @entity6 refused to comment on today 's claims when approached by @entity52			0
it is understood that many of the emails were made available to @entity57 's @entity56 as long as 16 months ago by the @entity58			0
the @entity6 was provided with the emails after they were disclosed by @entity8 to the @entity60			1
it is unclear whether they were then shared with the @entity62 or with defence lawyers			0
a @entity8 executive said today : ' reports that there are new hacking allegations or newly discovered emails are false			1
' we voluntarily produced material to the @entity60 more than a year ago and we understand that material was fully available to the authorities in the @entity24 well before the trial			2
â€™ one report today suggested that the prosecution told the trial about their existence in april , towards the end of evidence being brought			0
however the emails themselves were not used			0
the twist comes amid reports mrs @entity36 and former @entity85 editor @entity37 were cautioned as part of an on - going corporate investigation into @entity1 's @entity40			1
according to the @entity88 , mrs @entity36 and @entity37 were formally cautioned by @entity57 in may 2012 following a probe into the company - formally known as @entity40 - over hacking and bribing offences			1
a corporate charge for @entity40 would have serious implications to the running of @entity8 mr @entity1 leaves his home this morning			1
the alleged corporate probe is separate to the individual hacking prosecutions this week - which saw @entity37 found guilty of conspiracy to intercept voicemails mr @entity1 was said to be at @entity40 's @entity102 base today for talks following the hacking trial verdict news @entity24 today refused to comment on the corporate charge and the allegations of cautions for mrs @entity36 and @entity37			1
the alleged caution is entirely separate from the hacking trial which culminated this week with @entity37 - @entity112 's former director of communications - being found guilty of conspiring to intercept voice - mails			1
@entity37 will be sentenced next week - as will five other former employees of the company who pleaded guilty to phone hacking			2
mrs @entity36 , however , was cleared of all charges			1
it has also been suggested today that mr @entity1 himself will be questioned by the @entity122 while in @entity123 this week			0
however , a spokesman for @entity40 categorically denied this was the case			0
ms @entity36 , who was cleared of all phone hacking charges in court this week , is said to have been cautioned by @entity57 in may 2012 the @entity8 boss was seen leaving his central @entity123 home this morning and is rumoured to have gone to the company 's east @entity123 base in @entity102			1
it is suggested @entity57 has been sitting on evidence @entity40 could face corporate action as far back as october 2011			2
@entity37 was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones earlier this week			0
he is also said to have been cautioned by @entity57 bosses were then informed the company was under suspicion in may 2012 , it is claimed			2
until that point , it is thought @entity8 cooperated with police fully - a stance which changed when minutes from the @entity144 were requested			2
this is thought this move led to the confirmation that the company was being investigated - and not just individuals			0
shortly afterwards , @entity40 lawyers are said to have met with the @entity122 and the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) to argue corporate action would ' kill ' the company			1
lawyers are said to have argued such action would ' not be in the public interest ' as it would lead to 46,000 jobs being jeopardised			0
it was around this time that @entity158 and 21 century @entity159 , mr @entity1 's film and television companies , were separated from his newspaper businesses			0
the @entity122 is yet to hand over its evidence to the @entity62 , reports suggest			2
@entity57 today told @entity52 they were ' not prepared to discuss ' any of the allegations			0
when asked whether mr @entity1 was also facing questing , they said ' no comment '			0
@entity167 mp @entity166 told the @entity88 : ' it has now been revealed that a number of executives have been interviewed under caution , and now that the individual cases have been resolved , i am sure the @entity122 will apply their customary urgency and pass their work on potential corporate charges to the @entity62			0

@entity6 has up to 80,000 @entity8 emails taken from company servers , it is claimed
messages were not used as evidence in @entity24 hacking trial
include ' emails from former @entity40 ceo @entity36 '
