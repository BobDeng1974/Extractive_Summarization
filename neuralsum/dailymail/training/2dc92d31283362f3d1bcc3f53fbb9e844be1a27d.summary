@entity0 became ill and ended up in hospital @entity2 suddenly found himself being asked if he 'd been working out or was following a new fitness regimen			2
however , he did n't take this as a compliment			0
the @entity7 manager , who is just over 5ft 9in , had dropped from 13st to 10½ st in just a year , despite making no changes to his diet or exercise routine			1
' i was petrified i had cancer , ' says @entity0 , 43 , who lives with his wife @entity13 , 36 , a teacher , and their children @entity17 , seven , and @entity18 , two , in @entity19			0
after developing extreme fatigue and thirst , as well as needing to use the loo at night , he went to his gp			0
the doctor thought his symptoms pointed to diabetes and checked @entity0 's blood sugar			2
the reading was 13 ( a normal reading is four to seven ) and he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , which occurs when the body is n't making enough of the hormone insulin or the insulin it is making is n't working properly			1
insulin mops up sugar - or glucose - in the bloodstream , so it can be used by the cells for energy			0
@entity0 's age put him in the ' at risk ' category for type 2 diabetes			1
as well as being over 40 , other risk factors include being overweight , a family history of the condition or coming from @entity48 or black communities			0
@entity0 was given metformin , which cuts blood sugar levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced and released by the liver , and a meter to monitor his blood sugar daily			1
but his levels remained high and he continued to feel exhausted			1
despite repeated visits to his gp , it was n't until two weeks after his diagnosis when he was hospitalised with dangerously high blood sugar that doctors realised he did n't have type 2 diabetes - he had type 1			1
with type 2 diabetes , the body produces less insulin ; with type 1 , the body produces none at all			1
this is because type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system malfunctioning and attacking beta cells , the insulin - producing cells in the pancreas			2
around 400,000 people in @entity76 have type 1 diabetes , with one in five diagnosed over the age of 40			1
however , because the condition is traditionally thought to begin in children and younger people , doctors may be missing cases in adults			0
when home secretary @entity86 was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last year aged 56 , doctors first thought she had type 2			1
@entity0 was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes because usually younger people have type 1 @entity0 , too , had been told by his gp that he was the wrong age to have the condition			1
experts warn this is a common mistake and can have serious consequences			1
the only way type 1 diabetes can be treated is with regular insulin injections or an insulin pump			2
people with type 2 diabetes are offered insulin only if other treatments stop working			1
the risk is that patients who are misdiagnosed with type 2 end up with dangerously high blood sugar and can be put at risk of the life - threatening condition diabetic ketoacidosis			1
without insulin , the body can not use glucose in the blood for energy , so it breaks down fat and muscle for fuel instead			0
the by - products of this process are ketones , poisonous chemicals , which can build up and make the body acidic and cause dehydration			0
this can cause heart problems , kidney failure and even swelling of the brain , leading to coma and death			0
the lack of awareness about late - onset type 1 diabetes may be leading to some patients becoming seriously ill , according to a study earlier this year by the @entity136			1
the study 's co-author , professor @entity137 , highlighted the case of a 77 - year - old female patient who suddenly developed diabetic ketoacidosis due to type 1 diabetes			1
@entity0 also suffered from this complication and spent four days in hospital			0
one possible cause of late - onset type 1 is a group of viruses called coxsackie b viruses			2
most of us get these as children , but they can be caught in adulthood and cause illnesses from colds and mild gut problems to myocarditis ( inflammation of heart muscle )			0
the viruses seem to trigger the body 's immune system to malfunction and start slowly attacking the insulin - producing beta cells in the pancreas			0
' this can sometimes happen quickly , bringing on type 1 diabetes within weeks , but for most the beta cells are killed more gradually , ' says @entity169 , a clinical advisor to @entity171			2
' physical or mental stress - such as another virus , exam stress or surgery - can tip the body over the edge ( because the stress requires a surge of glucose to repair damaged cells in the body ) and suddenly type 1 diabetes occurs			1
' but even without stress , type 1 diabetes is inevitable because the virus has led to the beta cells being destroyed			2
@entity2 , who has type 1 diabetes but was diagnosed , with wife @entity188 and sons @entity18 , 2 , and @entity17 , 7 another risk factor for late - onset type 1 diabetes may be having other auto - immune conditions , says dr @entity193 , an endocrinologist at @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			1
@entity0 suffers from a number of auto - immune conditions - rheumatoid arthritis ( inflammation of the joints ) , ulcerative colitis ( inflammation of the lining of the colon ) and vitiligo ( this causes loss of skin pigment )			0
' when i was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 30 i was warned i may develop other auto - immune conditions , ' he says			0
' but my gp did n't consider that when diagnosing type 2 diabetes			1
' doctors should always investigate weight loss , says @entity169 : ' alarm bells should ring with gps if patients with high blood sugar have lost a lot of weight , even those over 40			1
' @entity223 symptoms come on over weeks and months while type 2 manifests gradually over years			2
' dr @entity193 suggests type 1 , not 2 , should be considered if patients are n't overweight			2
it was a sudden drop in weight that lead to @entity230 being diagnosed			0
the 51 - year - old administrator was diagnosed in february 2011 after she lost a stone in just three months without dieting			0
she also suffered from thirst and lethargy , and developed leg pains , a less common symptom that occurs because high blood sugar can damage the nerves			1
the proportion of hospital beds in @entity241 occupied by patients with diabetes she was admitted to hospital after her gp tested her blood sugar levels - at 27 , they were alarmingly high			1
' the doctor at the hospital was n't sure if i had type 1 or 2 , saying usually younger people had type 1 , so it was less likely i 'd have it at my age , ' says @entity230 , who lives with her husband @entity255 , 45 , a structural engineer , in @entity256 , and has two grown - up children			2
' i knew type 2 was linked to diet , so i just thought i 'd eaten too many sweets and cakes			2
' she stayed in hospital for four days to stabilise her blood sugar and was diagnosed with type 1 two weeks later			1
' the doctors were surprised due to my age			0
i was shocked , especially when they explained i 'd need insulin for life			0
' doctors said a virus may have been to blame - she 'd recently had a cold			0
to ensure that all patients receive the correct diagnosis , dr @entity193 recommends that where high blood sugar levels are accompanied by sudden or unexpected weight loss ( or where the patient is not overweight ) , the gp should talk to a diabetes specialist			1
they should also consider testing the patient 's blood for immune @entity282 ( glutamic acid decarboxylase ) antibodies			0
these attack the beta cells during an auto - immune reaction			0
' @entity223 patients are more likely to have these , so this can indicate if an older person has type 1 or 2 , ' says @entity169			2
' another blood test checking for c - peptide , a breakdown product created when insulin is produced , is also useful to determine what type of diabetes patients have			0
' the presence of c - peptide suggests it might be type 2			0
@entity0 and @entity230 want @entity302 to listen to this advice			0
@entity0 , who monitors his blood sugar levels and injects insulin daily , says : ' there 's a mindset that type 1 diabetes affects only young people and that 's why i was fitted into the type 2 category - but this could have cost my life			1

@entity2 , 43 , from @entity19 dropped from 13st to 10½ st in just a year
his high blood sugar reading meant he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
he was given metformin , which reduces glucose from the liver
but his levels remained high and he continued to feel exhausted
by the time doctors realised he actually had type 1 , he was in hospital
experts warn this is a common mistake and can have serious consequences
