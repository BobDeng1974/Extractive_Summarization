by @entity0 last updated at 1:23 pm on 27th december 2011 a mother has been reunited with her long - lost daughter who turned up on her doorstep as a man			1
@entity5 , 48 , was delighted when estranged daughter @entity6 , 26 , suddenly made contact after they spent 14 years apart			1
but she was stunned to discover that @entity6 is now a pre-op transsexual taking male hormones and living as a man called â€˜ @entity10 '			1
together at last : @entity11 was stunned when her daughter , now living as @entity10 , told her she was going to undergo a sex - change operation @entity10 , who has a daughter , revealed to her shocked mother she is about to undergo a full sex change operation to fulfil her dream of physically becoming a man			1
despite being a mother @entity10 , who says her pregnancy in 2006 only confirmed to her that she did not like her body , is determined to change her sex			1
she was born a girl but suffered from gender dysphoria all her life and said : ' i knew i was different from an early age			2
' i felt better when i was dressed in boys clothes but did n't have a clue why i was feeling this			0
' because of this i was the child from hell and it put a huge strain on my relationship with my family - especially my mum			2
' unhappy : @entity38 , who was born a girl , hated her body and shunned girlish toys @entity10 was sent to counsellors , social workers , youth groups and doctors but her erratic behaviour continued			1
her mother @entity47 said that even as a child @entity10 shunned girlish dolls and was perpetually upset : ' i remember when @entity10 ripped the wrapping paper off a present one @entity52 to reveal a new @entity54 doll and said " do n't like it "			1
' my little girl tossed it aside and turned back to her old building toys			2
' @entity10 - when he was @entity6 - always seemed desperately unhappy and was constantly moody			1
' it was like living with a stroppy teenager but she was n't even ten years old			2
' she was n't the girl i 'd dreamed of - she became a nightmare child			1
' the pair drifted apart after @entity10 went to live with her grandmother in @entity66 , @entity67 , aged 12			1
in 2006 @entity10 decided to become pregnant with a male friend as she wanted to be a mother , and gave birth to her daughter @entity72			1
big change : @entity10 , far right , gave birth to a daughter but is determined to become a man @entity10 added : ' one thing i was clear on was that i wanted to be a mother and i was keen for my child to be biologically mine			1
' i agreed with a male friend to have a baby and was over the moon when my daughter , @entity72 , was born in 2006			2
' i hated being pregnant though			0
i was just so embarrassed to walk around with this huge pregnant belly			0
' it was so feminine , so not " me " - if anything , having @entity72 just reinforced my feelings that i somehow did n't quite fit in my own body			1
' but the end result - being a mother to @entity72 - was amazing , and completely worth it			0
' after the birth @entity10 was resolved to live like a man and started taking male hormone drugs			1
@entity10 phoned her mother without warning in july 2010 to break the news about the drastic sex change , before visiting her at home			1
she said : ' i was really nervous when i called - i had already undergone numerous psychological tests and hormone therapy and would soon be starting testosterone injections followed by surgery			0
' i said , " mum , i 've got something to tell you			0
i 've been seeing doctors and psychiatrists in @entity110 and they agree with me - i 'm in the wrong body			2
i 'm becoming a man			0
' ' there was a long pause on the end of the line - i guess mum was trying to take it all in			0
' i snapped and said , " say something then			0
why are n't you shouting and screaming at me ? "			0
' but far from being angry , @entity47 was delighted that they had ' found the final piece of the jigsaw '			0
she said : ' after the shock subsided it was like a big penny had dropped			0
' suddenly all the awkwardness , the tantrums and depression made sense - i felt like we 'd found the final piece of the jigsaw			0
' i remember saying , " good for you			0
if it 's going to make you happy then for @entity136 's sake do it			0
that 's all i want - for you to be happy			0
' a couple of weeks later , @entity10 and @entity72 came over from @entity67 to visit @entity47 at her home in @entity141			2
@entity47 added : ' finally we were able to communicate - @entity10 and i did n't waste any time getting to know each other and we had a huge heart to heart			1
' we even went on the internet to research gender reassignment surgery together			0
' our relationship is brilliant now - i 've lost my daughter for ever but it 's worth it for the wonderful son i have instead			2

daughter @entity6 - now living as @entity10 - gave birth to a girl
says her pregnancy only confirmed that she did not ' fit ' her own body
