by @entity0 the latest victory in the battle of the handsets goes to @entity4 as test show its touchscreens are superior to those found on handsets made by rival @entity9			1
@entity11 firm @entity10 has found that while the touchscreen on the @entity13 only lost accuracy along the edges , but @entity9 's @entity16 and @entity17 were inaccurate across 75 per cent of their respective screens			1
researchers measured the screen accuracy on all three devices to within one millimetre using a robot with an artificial finger			1
passes are shown in green and fails are shown in red			0
@entity4 's @entity13 , right , lost accuracy at the edge of its display , whereas the @entity16 and @entity17 lost accuracy in 75 per cent of cases @entity9 's @entity16 , pictured , had a 25 per cent accuracy the @entity17 , pictured , had a similar accuracy score to the @entity16 @entity4 's @entity13 , pictured , only lost accuracy at the edges @entity41 used its @entity42 ( @entity42 ) to measure the accuracy of the touch panels on each phone			1
the @entity42 is fitted with artificial fingers			0
it presses the ' fingers ' onto the screen and records the coordinates , to within one millimetre			2
this creates a pass or fail score where passes are shown in green and fails are shown in red			0
@entity10 performed the first accuracy measurement by tapping the phones and comparing the actual touch position with reported coordinates			2
this created a pass or fail score , limited to plus or minus one millimetre			2
passes were shown in green and fails were shown in red			0
the accuracy of each screen was then plotted using these markers			2
researchers then used the robot , called the @entity71 ( @entity42 ) to simulate typing on each device along the qwerty keys			0
by using the robot , the researchers were able to accurately track the co-ordinates of the artificial screen in relation to the coordinates of the screen			2
@entity4 's @entity13 only lost accuracy along the side and top edges			1
this bezel is deliberately added to phones to prevent fingers accidentally clicking links , opening apps or swiping pages in a book accidentally			0
@entity41 used a robot called the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) to simulate typing on each device along the keys on the keyboard			0
this image shows the typing accuracy of the @entity13 , which only lost accuracy at the edges ( shown in red ) by comparison , typing on the @entity16 was less accurate than the @entity13			1
this image shows that the keyboard lost accuracy along the edges and in as far as the @entity105 on the left , and the letter i on the right , pictured both @entity9 devices had a high level of accuracy in the bottom left of the screen , but were less accurate elsewhere			1
by comparing coordinates , @entity10 was able to work out that @entity9 's phones were only accurate across 25 per cent of their screens , meaning they were inaccurate in 75 per cent of cases			1
this could explain why , on occasions , typos can be difficult to correct or why clicking on a specific link can take several attempts			0
' because the touch accuracy is more even in @entity13 than in @entity16 and @entity17 , you get fewer typing errors , and letters which are close to the edge are working better , ' said a spokesman for @entity41			1
' you can also test this by tapping letters on the edge and typing long text messages			0
' during the typing tests , @entity4 again only lost accuracy on the very edge of the keyboard , while @entity9 's keyboard lost accuracy inwards to the e on the left and the letter i on the opposite side of the board			1
the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , pictured , is fitted with artificial fingers			0
it presses the ' fingers ' onto the screen and records the coordinates , to within one millimetre the researchers concluded : ' today when mobile devices are getting more and more sophisticated , user actions with device are expanding user experience and the quality of device are becoming major differentiators in mobile business			2
' by reliably testing touch accuracy , latency , scroll performance or other features that strongly affect the real end user experience mobile and touch device manufacturers can achieve real market benefits without sacrificing user experience			0

the touchscreen of @entity4 's @entity13 was compared to the @entity16
@entity4 's screen only lost accuracy around the top and side edges
@entity9 's @entity16 was found to be inaccurate across 75 *%* of the screen
@entity11 researchers tested the screen 's accuracy to within one millimetre
