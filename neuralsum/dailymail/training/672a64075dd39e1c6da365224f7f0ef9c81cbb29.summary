by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 15 february 2013 outraged families have complained after discovering that their local council had put their front gardens up for auction			2
@entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , say they only found out when a brochure arrived advertising their four gardens as a single lot to be sold for development			1
the householders , one of whom says the land is the only access he has to his house , have rented the strips of land from @entity20 for 25 years			1
' i will be trespassing to get to my own front door ' : homeowner @entity23 in his front garden in @entity6 @entity25 shot showing the land the council is selling , including the strip giving access to mr @entity23 's home ' someone could pitch a caravan in my front garden and i would be powerless ' : @entity34 in front of the land now their four gardens are up for auction as one lot with a guide price of £ 2,000 , and @entity23 , whose front garden offers the only access to his home in @entity44 , has the most to lose			1
mr @entity23 , 41 , said : ' i would technically be trespassing across someone else 's land to get to my own front door			1
' what if the owner refused to let me access my own home ? what would i do ? ' neighbour @entity52 , 61 , also of @entity44 , said : ' anyone could buy the land			2
' someone could just turn up , pitch up a caravan in our front garden , and i would be looking down at them from my balcony , powerless to stop them			2
' they could cut down all my trees , rip up the path and what could i do about it ? it 's just such bad practice from the council			0
wanting reimbursement for the work they 've done : @entity72 and @entity73 in their @entity75 garden the land in question lies beyond the gravel path crossing the picture , which was taken from the @entity82 ' house ' the very least they could have done is spoken to us individually and given us the chance to buy what we feel is essentially our land			1
' the residents say they have been fighting for years to purchase their gardens , but have been refused permission by the county council			0
those affected live on three separate roads , @entity44 , @entity94 and @entity75			0
because the four gardens are being sold as a single lot , if one of the families decided to foot the £ 2,000 bill , they would also own their neighbours ' gardens			1
@entity103 , 66 , of @entity75 , said : ' i am absolutely disgusted this can be allowed to go ahead			0
' how would i feel if i did buy it , going up to @entity52 and saying i 've just bought your land ? ' one thing 's for certain : i will be wanting reimbursement for all the years and all the money i 've spent making my garden look beautiful			1
' furious : resident @entity114 in front of the land that @entity20 is auctioning off later this month @entity23 , @entity114 , @entity52 , and @entity73 and @entity103 , left to right , say the first they knew was when the auction brochure arrived @entity120 , leader of the @entity121 , is writing to county council chief executive @entity122 on behalf of residents to try to stop the auction going ahead			1
he said : ' the residents contacted me because they were so desperate , they did n't know what to do			0
in all my time in public life i have never heard of anything as ridiculous as this			0
' the auction , which is being held by @entity131 , will take place at the @entity133 , in @entity134 , @entity135 on february 25			0
an @entity20 spokesman said : ' while we appreciate the residents ' situation , the land concerned is @entity20 land , and this would have been made clear when the houses were bought			2
' @entity20 , through our agents , visited all of the auction sites and where possible made contact with all those with an interest in the land			2
' we have had no approaches , prior to the auction , from anyone interested in buying the land			0
however the auctioneers have discussed how to bid for this land with the homeowners , as this offers a quick and cheaper opportunity for them to buy this land			0
