by @entity0 published : 23:17 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 04:14 est , 10 september 2012 the shocking @entity3 massacre was dismissed as nothing more than a trivial news item by the @entity7 media			1
despite the terrifying nature of the killings - and the horrific discovery that a four - year - old girl had been left under her family 's corpses in the car for eight hours - the country 's journalists paid little attention to the events			1
for newspapers and news networks in @entity7 the execution - style slayings of the @entity24 family constitute what is known as a ' fait divers ' - a term used to describe a trivial news item			2
not newsworthy ? the bullet - riddled @entity29 where the @entity24 family were discovered news of the cold - blooded multiple murders emerged well in time for newspaper deadlines on both sides of the @entity34 , but only @entity36 papers carried it on their front pages on thursday			1
centre - right daily @entity38 reported the story only on page eight , while leftwing paper liberation relegated the shocking story to page 14			2
even when one of the victims was on friday named as @entity7 local @entity45 , a father of three , only local papers and national tabloid @entity48 put the story on the front page			1
aeronautical engineer @entity53 , his wife @entity50 , 47 , a dentist , and his mother - in - law @entity52 , 74 , were discovered dead at a remote beauty spot near the village of @entity57 , by @entity58 , last wednesday			0
ignored : no mention on @entity38 's front page the day after the murder of @entity53 , right , and his family each was shot twice in the head in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire thought to have lasted around 30 seconds			2
also in the car were the couple 's daughters @entity69 , seven , and @entity72 , four , who both survived the attack			0
seriously injured @entity69 was just yesterday brought out of a medically induced coma and is recovering in hospital in @entity76 after being shot in the shoulder and pistol - whipped			0
her younger sister , who hid for hours beneath the skirt of her dead mother , returned to the @entity36 yesterday in the care of relatives			0
@entity83 wrote in an article how the @entity85 had been ' sarcastic ' about the efforts and methods of local police , who took eight hours to realise @entity72 was alive and hiding in the car			1
' maybe some people saw @entity92			0
i really do n't know ' : @entity94 , the prosecutor of @entity58 , seemed perplexed by the in - depth questioning by @entity97 reporters according to the @entity99 , the paper added that the distrust was not entirely misplaced since @entity7 police had been responsible for ' several legal or administrative fiascoes after the murder of @entity36 citizens on @entity7 soil			1
' @entity7 's most watched news network @entity106 hailed the @entity85 's ' race for information ' which turned up the first photos of the dead man , his car and details of his family			2
particularly perplexed by @entity36 journalists ' insatiable appetite for detail was public prosecutor @entity94			1
' why is that important ? ' he replied more than once to forensic questioning at the ends of @entity97 reporters at daily press conferences , the @entity99 reported			0
' maybe some people saw @entity92			0
i really do n't know , ' he reportedly answered journalists badgering him about what witnesses may or may not have seen .			0
