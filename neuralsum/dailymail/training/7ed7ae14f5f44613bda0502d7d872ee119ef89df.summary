by @entity1 reporter published : 12:12 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 31 october 2013 the @entity2 confirmed , and then quickly denied , that the mysterious new barge in @entity4 belongs to @entity5			1
on wednesday , the @entity2 visited the barge on @entity7 , near the @entity8			1
a spokesman for the @entity2 said that @entity5 is the owner of the barge , but that they ca n't say more about the project due to a nondisclosure agreement			1
' we can confirm that @entity5 is involved or associated with the barge but there is a nondisclosure agreement in effect ; the @entity2 is unable to discuss or divulge any further details at this time , ' petty officer 1st class @entity14 told @entity22			1
neither confirming or denying : members of the @entity2 have confirmed that the mysterious four - story barge in @entity4 is owned by @entity5			1
but shortly after making those statements another official retracted them under wraps : the @entity4 barge is docked at @entity7 in the @entity4 and is guarded by security and fences possible : this large structure parked between @entity4 and @entity32 , could be a floating data center being made by @entity5 but officer @entity35 's statement was quickly countered by petty officer @entity36 who told the @entity37 that the @entity2 would not be confirming or denying @entity5 's alleged ownership of the barge			1
' due to issues of commercial confidentiality we are unable to disclose any more information at this time , ' officer @entity40 said			0
lt @entity45 told the @entity46 that he had n't signed a non-disclosure agreement , but had been told by his superiors not to discuss the project because of ' legal reasons '			0
' once the project is completed , we will be releasing information , ' he said			0
the mystery surrounding the barge in @entity4 recently crossed the continent thanks to a similar barge showing up in the @entity56 , @entity57 harbor			1
mystery : this is the @entity57 barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by @entity5 according to @entity2 officials there , no such non-disclosure agreement has been set up because work has not started on the barge			1
construction is expected to start once the @entity4 project wraps			2
however , @entity70 says that the @entity2 officials in @entity57 know the owner of the @entity56 barge			1
' we have people in the ( @entity2 's ) @entity76 who have been asked by the owner not to talk about it , ' @entity70 told the @entity79			2
' they are fully aware of what 's on the barge			0
' petty officer @entity83 , spokesman for the @entity2 in @entity84 , said it was n't uncommon for the @entity2 to enter into a non-disclosure agreement			2
but what 's piquing interest the most is not whether or not @entity5 owns the barges			2
@entity90 put out a pretty convincing story connecting the company to the barges			0
what they will be used for is more puzzling			0
plans ? sources say @entity5 hopes to tow the completed structure from @entity7 across the @entity4 to @entity4 's @entity99 , where it would be anchored and open to the public is this it ? a 2009 patent filed by @entity5 shows a water - borne data center one theory is that they are being built as floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers			1
@entity5 has refused to comment on the vessels , though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally - friendly sea - powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent			2
the @entity37 reports the @entity57 barge is docked at the city 's @entity122 's @entity121			0
contractors from local engineering firm @entity125 are installing high - tech equipment in the vessel , though workers said even they did n't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for			0
@entity133 is known about them , but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor			0
the structures are registered with a @entity141 corporation as @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
in binary code used in computing , the numbers spell out ' one , ' ' two , ' ' three ' and ' four			0
' currently , numbers 1 and 2 are on the water in @entity4 and no. 3 is in @entity152			2
this is an aerial view of the ' secret project ' in @entity4 this is @entity156 3 on @entity7 , alongside @entity157 , as seen in @entity158 , before construction began also , the @entity141 company to which they 're registered is called @entity163 and large , a likely joking reference to ' @entity163 , ' the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 @entity166 film ' @entity165 ' @entity5 's patent describes ' a system includes a floating platform - mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units , a sea - based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units , and one or more sea - water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units			1
' @entity180 , the principal at @entity181 , which designs custom cargo container buildings , said the structure looks like a data center			1
' the cutouts in the long walls of the containers , when they line up , they make hallways , ' @entity180 told @entity90			0
' you could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers ... it does n't have enough windows for an office building			0
' @entity198 , a @entity199 research fellow and expert on data centers , said companies such as @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , and @entity206 have been installing specially built data centers in shipping containers for some time because they 're easy to deploy			0
meanwhile , @entity210 5 reports that @entity5 is actually building a floating marketing center at @entity156 for @entity212 , the cutting - edge wearable computer the company has under development			1
another theory is that @entity5 is building a floating marketing center at for @entity212 , the cutting - edge wearable computer the company has under @entity210 5 claims sources say @entity5 hopes to tow the completed structure from @entity7 across the @entity4 to @entity4 â€™s @entity99 , where it would be anchored and open to the public			1
the media outlet also reported that construction on the site , near the @entity8 , stopped several weeks ago because @entity5 does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront			2
construction on the site commenced last year , and the work is being shielded by a high security fence .			0

the @entity2 confirmed *yesterday* that they visited the mysterious four - storey barge being constructed in @entity4
the barge is thought to be owned by @entity5 , which some have theorized could be a floating data center or retain store
members of the @entity2 confirmed that the barge is owned by @entity5 , but another @entity238 official quickly retracted those statements
