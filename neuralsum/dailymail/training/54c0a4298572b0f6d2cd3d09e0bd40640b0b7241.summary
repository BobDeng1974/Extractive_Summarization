forget the evidence for the @entity1 , consign memories of the most @entity4 - like world outside the solar system to the bin and free your mind of thoughts about the bones of the newly - crowned world ’s largest dinosaur , @entity13			0
because these scientific accomplishments from earlier this year pale in comparison to what might be the most important piece of research of all : why dogs smell each other ’s behinds			1
and it turns out the odd behaviour is more vital than it first appears : it gives the sniffer details on the sniffee ’s sex , diet , emotional state and more thanks to complex chemical communications			1
it 's revealed that they do this to find out information about other dogs including the gender , diet and emotional state of the dog being smelled in a video by reactions , it ’s explained how a dog ’s nose is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human nose			1
and when a dog smells the rear end of another , it ’s actually collecting important information			1
the video explains how in 1975 , dr @entity62 of the @entity63 in @entity64 examined the anal secretions of dogs and wild coyotes to study this behaviour			0
they found that on the rear - end of the dog is an area called the anal sac , which excretes identifying chemicals to other dogs			1
one of the glands here is the apocrine gland , which gives the dog its natural smell			2
another called the sebaceous gland also plays a part , which mostly lubricates and waterproofs the skin and hair of mammals			0
dr @entity62 found that the primary chemical compounds that are released from these glands and produce a dog ’s aroma are a variety of short - chain acids and something known as trimethylamine			0
for centuries , dogs have been man 's best friend			0
but it turns out canines would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a treat			0
a study in @entity104 found that dogs interacted with robots similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed ' social '			0
the researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots directions			0
but the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it 's monitor , and acted ' socially '			2
@entity120 is an organic compound that is a product of the decomposition of plants and animals , and is the odour often associated with rotting fish or bad breath			0
the aroma given off by the dog is dependent upon some of the factors mentioned earlier - diet , gender , emotional state and more			1
when one dog smells another , it is able to pick up on these finer details and learn information that would otherwise be mostly unavailable			2
but how are dogs able to pick up on these smells over some of the more powerful odours that may come from a dogs excrement ? ‘ you ’d think the smell of dog poop would overpower @entity150 ’s sensitive smell , but dogs have a second olfactory system in their hyper - sensitive nose called the jacobson ’s organ , ’ the narrator explains			1
this organ is designed specifically for chemical communication and not for smelling other aromas			0
with its own set of nerves to the brain , the organ is able to circumvent other organs in the nose used for smelling and let the dog know the chemical characteristics of the dog it is smelling			2
and so , as the video concludes , the reason dogs smell one another is n’t for fun but rather they are ‘ getting to know each other in a special aromatic way			1
’ smell ya later : dogs are n't just smelling each other for fun ; the action actually has an important purpose that gives them information about the dog they are sniffing , made possible by the fact that a dog ’s nose ( stock image shown ) is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human nose			1

a video produced by @entity35 's @entity34 reveals the science behind why dogs smell each other
it 's revealed that they do this to find out information about other dogs
glands in a dog 's behind secretes chemicals that can reveal key information
this includes the gender , diet and emotional state of the dog being smelled
and dogs *discern* this information from other more *pungent* smells by using something called @entity219 's organ in their nose
