by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 21:10 est , 11 march 2013 in a text message to his son , @entity1 wrote he had ‘ no intention of sending @entity5 to @entity6 ’			1
but that is exactly where @entity8 was last night as she began her eight - month jail sentence			1
conditions in the prison , @entity16 ’s largest women ’s jail , will be a world away from her £ 2million @entity19 townhouse ten miles across @entity20			2
behind bars : @entity1 ( left , arriving at court with partner @entity22 ) will be starting his eight month sentence at @entity24 , while @entity8 ( right ) will be at @entity6 @entity26 walls : @entity24 , in @entity20 , which is home to 1,600 hardened cons institution : @entity29 holds up to 500 criminals from murderesses to petty thieves the jail , which holds up to 500 criminals from murderesses to petty thieves , has a reputation as a brutal and unrelenting institution where bullying and pilfering is rife			1
@entity41 squabbles frequently erupt into violence			0
@entity1 ’s destination was similarly bleak : the @entity26 walls of @entity45 in @entity20 , which is home to 1,600 hardened cons. both the former cabinet minister and his economist ex-wife were ferried from the court in the back of a prison van known as the ‘ sweatbox ’ which carries convicted felons to nearby prisons			1
on arrival at @entity6 , @entity8 ’s handcuffs will have been removed and she will have stood in line with the other arrivals waiting to be processed			1
after a pat down search ( women inmates are not required to strip ) for any contraband , she will have confirmed her personal details to a prison officer , including her name and date of birth			2
she will have handed over her purse , handbag , keys and mobile phone to be placed into secure storage , have had her fingerprints taken and have posed for a prison mugshot			2
like all other women prisoners she will be allowed to wear her own clothes while behind bars			0
@entity8 ( left ) outside her @entity20 home , prior to being sentenced for perverting the course of justice , and @entity1 ( right ) leaving his home in central @entity20 on sunday @entity6 has a mixture of cells : single , shared between two and larger dorms			1
but a prison source said it was unlikely @entity8 would have to share			1
her high profile and wealth leave her more open to threats and blackmail – and prison bosses will want to ensure she comes to no harm			1
@entity6 has a gym , pool table and hairdressing salon and televisions in cells , but the institution and its occupants will still be a terrifying prospect for @entity8			1
a recent inspection report exposed widespread bullying and violence			0
as well as violent drug addicts , prostitutes and petty villains , the prison holds lifers with little to lose			2
former residents include @entity109 , the mother of @entity109 , and @entity111 , 21 , who beat her neighbour to death			0
a @entity24 officer watches over the cells on e wing @entity1 ’s new neighbours behind @entity24 ’s walls will be no more savoury , from violent killers to armed robbers , thugs and burglars			1
unlike his wife , he will have no choice about what he can wear behind bars			0
at the weekend it emerged he once visited a stylist to get his ‘ colours ’ done – before throwing out any shirts and ties that did n’t match recommended tones			0
but at ‘ @entity135 ’ , it will be prison - issue blue trousers or jeans and grey sweatshirt			2
if he wants a haircut , it will be the prison barber , rather than his usual £ 75 affair			2
he too is unlikely to be in a shared cell , even after he is transferred onto a main wing of the prison after a few days of acclimatisation			2
his cell will have a television and a toilet at the end of the bed , which has a duvet and a single pillow			0
@entity109 , the mother of @entity109 , is among the former residents of @entity6 @entity155 , another onetime cabinet minister jailed for lying , writes in his autobiography of the terrifying chants other inmates struck up when the lights went out , describing how they wanted to hurt him			1
he writes : ‘ i do not think i have ever felt more lonely , more frightened or more vulnerable			0
’ @entity1 ’s notoriety means he can expect similar treatment			1
both he and his ex-wife will be grateful their stays in central @entity20 jails will be short			0
after a week or two at most they will be moved to a low security ‘ open prison ’ , probably @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 , for her and he to @entity174 in @entity175			2
under these low security category d conditions both will have more freedom to leave their cells , mix with other white collar criminals and take part in prison activities			2
both are likely to be granted early release after just a quarter of their sentence , and will return home wearing an electronic tag and under a strict eight - hour curfew			0
but last night that will have felt a long way away			0
after processing at their respective prisons , each was handed a simple arrival pack containing basic toiletries such as a soap and a toothbrush and a chocolate bar			0
both will have been allowed a shower and then a short phone call of a few minutes			0
then it will be off to the cells , the key turning in the lock and then lights out			0
@entity206 , an ex-convict turned prisons expert and editor of inmates newspaper @entity209 , believes @entity1 will be deemed at risk to self harm or even suicide and placed in the prison hospital			1
‘ he has fallen an incredible distance from grace in a very short space of time , until recently he was in complete denial of his offence and this is his first time in prison , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s a convict now , no different to anyone else in the prison and he needs to knuckle down , accept his fate and get on with progressing through the prison system ’ - @entity206 , ex-con and editor of inmates newspaper @entity209 ‘ as such he bears on his face all the classic hallmarks of a person susceptible to self harm and suicide			1
’ the cells in @entity24 are 12ft by 7ft with a window high in the back wall and a toilet and wash basin behind a small modesty screen in the corner			1
@entity1 will have to leave fine dining behind for now , as he is presented with typical @entity24 grub , such as a stew dubbed the ‘ mystery bowl ’ and a cup of a bitter tea known as ‘ diesel ’			1
mr @entity206 said he expected @entity1 to be mocked by his fellow prisoners and even by the prison staff – with jibes about his privileged background almost inevitable			1
mr @entity206 added : ‘ life as he has known it before today will never be the same again			0
it ’s important to his safety that he does n’t put on airs and graces			0
‘ he ’s a convict now , no different to anyone else in the prison and he needs to knuckle down , accept his fate and get on with progressing through the prison system			0
