by @entity0 published : 18:22 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 18:30 est , 8 november 2012 to people who were caught in snarled traffic or had to shovel snow with leaves still on the trees , the storm pulling off the @entity2 on thursday was your basic nor'easter			2
to @entity11 , it was @entity12			1
the network has taken to naming winter storms , much like is done for tropical systems			2
it also draws attention to @entity11 at times of bad weather , when the network 's ratings usually soar			1
the @entity43 names hurricanes but is n't recognizing the cable channel 's winter storm names			1
the government agency sent out an advisory to its personnel wednesday asking them to ' please refrain from using the term " @entity12 " in any of our products			1
' all their own : so long as viewers tune into the @entity11 they can see storms named like @entity12 and @entity24 , as seen here already reported on their website many news services , including the @entity0 , are n't recognizing the names in their coverage , either			1
the weather service has said it has no opinion about the names but noted that winter storms can end and redevelop , making it difficult to define where one storm ends and another begins			2
oddly enough , it was the weather service that first dubbed @entity70 ' @entity70 ' many days before it made landfall			0
that nickname faded , in large part because @entity11 would not use it for fear it made light of a serious situation			0
covered : over four inches of snow was seen falling over @entity80 's @entity79 in @entity81 though leaves still covered the trees there as well @entity84 : a list of 26 names have been planned out for this winter season primarily using @entity88 or @entity89 names while one storm has been named q for the @entity81 subway line at @entity11 , a team of meteorologists decides which winter storms get names based on factors like expected snow depth and wind speed , handing them out no more than three days in advance			0
@entity12 was named , in part , for fears that it would add to damage in areas already reeling from @entity70			1
the winter storm dropped as much as a foot of snow in some parts of @entity108 and knocked out power to tens of thousands of customers			0
the @entity11 has already named another winter storm expected to sock the @entity112 as @entity24			0
earlier this fall , the network released in advance a list of 26 names it will be using for storms , also like is done for hurricanes			0
the names , including @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , are primarily based in @entity88 or @entity89 mythology , although the storm dubbed simply @entity126 was named for the @entity81 subway line			1
if anyone is digging out from @entity130 in a couple of months , you 'll know it has been a brutal winter			0
watch the video here :			0

naming would help draw attention to both the storm and channel when their ratings usually soar
other news networks including the @entity43 are *refusing* to copy
@entity43 : ' please refrain from using the term " @entity12 " in any of our products '
