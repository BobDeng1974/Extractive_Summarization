new outlook : ' it 's a shame you have to go through something that almost takes life away to appreciate it more , ' ms @entity0 said during an interview at her home ' by assuming this role and trying to be a voice for women and trying to make a difference , and to try to get women out there to realize that early detection is everything ... do n't think that it 's okay to wait another year for the mammogram , and do n't wait till you 're 40 - if you have a lot [ of breast cancer ] in your family , maybe you need to get it earlier - because that is going to depend on your survival			1
