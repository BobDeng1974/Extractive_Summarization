men who recover from @entity2 must abstain from having sex for three months or risk passing on the disease in their semen , health experts have warned			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) said the virus , which has claimed almost 7,000 lives in @entity9 this year , can remain in a survivor 's seminal fluid for 82 days			1
the @entity6 said : ' men who have recovered from ebola virus disease should be aware that seminal fluid may be infectious for as long as three months after onset of symptoms			1
' because of the potential to transmit the virus sexually during this time , they should maintain good personal hygiene after masturbation , and either abstain from sex ( including oral sex ) for three months after onset of symptoms , or use condoms if abstinence is not possible			0
pictured , staff from the charity @entity36 , are seen carrying the body of a person killed by the disease four studies examining a total of 43 patients found three men who survived the disease still had the live virus in their semen 40 days , 61 days and 82 days respectively , after the onset of symptoms			1
experts at the @entity6 said no case of sexual transmission of @entity2 has been documented			1
they added it is unclear whether semen that tests positive for the virus is actually infectious			2
the four studies were carried out in different countries , and the first dates back more than 30 years			0
the disease is highly contagious , and is spread via bodily fluids including blood , saliva and faeces			0
more than 16,000 people are known to have been infected with @entity2 since the current outbreak began in december last year			1
of those , 6,928 people have died , according to the @entity61 health agency			0
the virus causes haemorrhagic fever , and as yet there is no cure or vaccine			0
almost all cases and all but 15 deaths have been in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 - the countries hardest hit during this outbreak			1
in the last week the @entity6 reported 600 new cases across the three nations			2
symptoms include fever , headache , diarrhoea , vomiting and in extreme cases , internal bleeding			0
two months ago the @entity6 launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in @entity9			2
experts aimed to isolate 70 per cent of victims in the three hardest - hit countries by december 1			2
new data reveals there have been a total of 16,169 cases in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , and approximately three dozen cases elsewhere			1
experts at the @entity6 said no case of sexual transmission of @entity2 has been recorded @entity72 has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths , but the rate of infection is currently slowing there			1
in contrast , the disease is now spreading fastest in @entity71			2
out of the three @entity9 countries , only @entity70 was on track to meet the december 1 goal , according to an update from @entity6			1
in @entity72 , only 23 per cent of cases are isolated and 26 per cent of the required burial teams are in place			0
in @entity71 , about 40 per cent of cases are isolated while 27 per cent of burial teams are prepared and ready			2
the outbreak of @entity2 was first reported in @entity70 in march and spiralled out of control after being declared a public health emergency in august			1
dr. @entity114 , who is directing the @entity6 's response to @entity2 , acknowledged in october that reaching today 's goal would be ' really pushing the system hard '			1
he said : ' if we do n't do it in 60 days and we take 90 days : no. 1 , a lot more people will die that should n't ; and no. 2 , we will need that much more capacity on the ground to be able to manage the caseload			0
' in recent weeks , there have been some successes in curbing the deadly disease , with cases in @entity72 and @entity70 appearing to be declining or stabilising			1
however , the areas around @entity71 's capital and a district in the country 's north are seeing a severe surge in cases			0
@entity138 , of @entity139 in @entity140 , who sits on @entity6 's @entity142 committee , said failing to reach the target now suggests @entity2 will spread even further as capacities to respond become even more stretched			1
it comes as the death toll reaches almost 7,000 - all but around 15 deaths have been recorded in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 health workers wearing protective suits help a patients suspected of having @entity2 to a treatment centre ' we need to redouble our efforts to see what we can do to reduce the spread and catch up with the virus , ' he said			1
' right now , it does n't look good			0
' dr. @entity159 , an @entity2 expert who previously worked for the @entity6 , said : ' we hope that what we 're seeing in @entity72 will continue , but unfortunately what can happen with @entity2 is that it can go to new countries , as it has already to @entity164			1
' the most dangerous thing would be if people now think @entity2 is over and become complacent			0
' earlier this month , the @entity167 announced it was scaling back the size and number of @entity2 clinics it had initially promised to build in @entity72 , citing a drop in cases			2
the ultimate goal of @entity6 's plan now is to isolate all @entity2 patients and provide safe burials by january 1			2
they believe that the number of deaths is likely far higher , given the difficulty in collecting comprehensive figures and with @entity2 having a high fatality rate			0
the first case discovered in the current outbreak was in @entity70 in december 2013			1
in @entity164 , the most recent county in the region hit by @entity2 , the @entity6 spoke of eight confirmed cases , six of which had proved fatal			2
the tolls in @entity140 ( eight fatalitie ) and @entity189 ( one sole case ) have remained unchanged for 57 days			0
both countries have thus been taken off the danger list			0
people caring for the sick or handling the bodies of people infected @entity2 are especially exposed			0
health workers have been among the worst hit , with 340 deaths out of 592 cases			0
outside of @entity9 , there have been four @entity2 cases diagnosed in the @entity167 one of which was fatal			0
there has also been one confirmed case in @entity206 , a nurse who has recovered .			0

the @entity6 said the virus was found in the semen of a survivor after 82 days during a study
