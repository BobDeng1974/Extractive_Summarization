a schoolboy with a rare illness which means he is allergic to sunlight has been racially abused in the street because of the brown suncream he has to wear			1
@entity5 , 11 , is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside			1
he suffers from the condition @entity8 , whose victims are nicknamed ' real - life vampires ' because their skin can not be exposed to direct sunlight			1
@entity5 must use the special brown suncream ( pictured ) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy he suffers from the condition @entity8 , which means he suffers from terrible sunburn ( pictured ) when exposed to sunlight @entity5 , from @entity17 in @entity18 , was given @entity19 , a thick brown paste which blocks out the light			1
but when strangers shouted out abuse such as ' chocolate face ' and ' you 're coloured ' because of his unusual appearance , he refused to wear it any more			1
his mother @entity28 , 34 , said : ' when he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say			1
i do n't know why			1
' it was either ignorance or evilness			2
people think he 's different so they taunted him			1
i hate that people take the mickey out of him			2
' the cream was meant to protect him but he 's stopped wearing it now			1
' the unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long - sleeved shirt , trousers , and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun , which would be like having ' boiling water poured on him '			2
however , his condition can also can flare up when he is inside , so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun 's rays			1
' his school got new lightbulbs in october , ' mrs @entity59 said			2
' immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up			2
he was in agony , i was so worried			1
' it turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights			2
the school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better			2
family : @entity73 with his mother @entity28 and younger sister @entity75 , who does not have the condition @entity8 occurs when there is a build - up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood			1
the skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths ( @entity83 ) and to visible light			2
it is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem			2
as a result of this enzyme deficiency , protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood			2
as blood passes through the skin , the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues			2
the nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain , and if the blood vessels are affected , they can leak fluid , causing swelling			0
the condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling , itching and burning when exposed to sunlight			1
there is currently no cure			0
source : @entity117 she added : ' he was first diagnosed when he was two			0
he was playing football in the garden with my husband , @entity122			0
' but after half an hour outside , they came running towards me , @entity5 screaming			1
he said his hands hurt			0
they had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves			0
' i put them under the cold tap and looked at him			0
his skin was red hot and burning			0
it was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size			0
' the family visited their gp , who suggested that @entity5 might be allergic to grass			1
' he was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away , ' his mother said			0
' but it kept happening and i took @entity5 to the doctors three times that week			1
' painkillers and allergy tablets did n't help			0
every time he was outside , any exposed skin became red raw , his face and hands would swell up			0
he would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference			0
' eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition			1
' we were told to wrap him up and use the special cream , ' mrs @entity59 added			0
' so , even if it 's overcast , @entity5 still wears a hat , scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin			1
the @entity19 cream is so important			0
' she spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter @entity75 had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to @entity5 for his bravery			1
' even after all he 's been through @entity177 is brilliant , ' mrs @entity59 said			0
' he is your typical 11 - year - old lad			0
even when he is flaring up , he just shrugs his shoulders			0
' he always wears a hat too he just puts up with it though			1
he ’s so brave and does n’t let it get him down			0
even though other kids can play football in the sunshine			0
' mrs @entity59 continued : ' doctors said his @entity8 was an inherited condition			1
@entity122 had a variant gene , i had a mutant gene			0
so when i fell pregnant with @entity75 i was terrified she ’d be born with @entity8 too			1
' luckily she was n't			0

@entity5 suffers from rare condition @entity8
he wears a thick brown *sunscream* to block out harmful rays which would leave him in agony
but after strangers taunted him with racist abuse he stopped using it
