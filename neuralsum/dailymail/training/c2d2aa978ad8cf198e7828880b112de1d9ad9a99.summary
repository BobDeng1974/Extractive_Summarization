she might not have had the best @entity1 thanks to the tragic death of her grandmother , but @entity4 appears to be overcoming adversity in style			2
photos from her latest campaign , for @entity11 swimwear brand @entity9 , show the 28 - year - old at her glamorous best , posing on a tropical beach in a succession of teeny bikinis			1
the campaign is the latest in a series of career coups for the @entity20 model , who last year , appeared in editorial features in a host of prestigious magazines as well as on the cover of @entity27 @entity26			1
but , as these photos prove , she wo n't be giving up her modelling career in the near future - and even managed to make some of the more dubious designs look good			2
particularly outré was an antique gold number , which could have come direct from the costume department of @entity39 : the @entity40 , and came complete with bling straps encrusted with turquoise stones			1
in better taste was a cobalt @entity31 number that boasted a smattering of pretty beading and a relatively restrained black and silver option			0
@entity39 approved : some of the designs could have come direct from the set of @entity39 : the @entity40 the designer behind the brand is @entity63 @entity62 , a former swimwear model herself , who says the idea for her own label arose after she was unable to find beachwear to suit			1
' either they were too conservative with too much coverage , or they were n’t very classy , ' she complains in an interview on the @entity9 website			2
' there was nothing out there that was sexy and elegant			0
so i decided to design my own			0
' having concluded that ' sexy cuts ' with copious embellishment were the future of swimwear , she launched her label in 2004			1
' some people said i was crazy , that my designs were too risky , too out - there to catch on , ' she adds			0
' i guess they were wrong			0
' cover - up : @entity4 works the classic leather jacket and swimsuit combination with aplomb bold : @entity4 shows off a red and gold bikini and a cutaway white swimsuit enlivened with a shimmering strap			0

the model , 28 , is fronting the new campaign for @entity11 label @entity9
makes her acting debut later this year in @entity39 : the @entity40
stars *alongside* @entity43 as @entity41 , the vengeful wife of @entity39
