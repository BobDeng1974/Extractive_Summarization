a huge planet ten times larger than @entity1 may be orbiting the sun at the edge of our solar system			1
researchers have discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 @entity8 , along with up to 900 other objects , are orbiting in a similar formation			1
this suggests that a larger planet , dubbed a @entity13 because of its size , may be creating a shepherding effect pulling these objects around with it			1
these are the discovery images of 2012 @entity8			2
three images of the night sky , each taken about two hours apart , were combined into one			0
the first image was artificially coloured red , second green , and third blue			0
2012 @entity8 moved between each image as seen by the red , green and blue dots the observable solar system is divided into three distinct regions including the rocky terrestrial planets such as @entity1 , the gas giants like @entity31 and @entity32 , and the icy @entity34 objects - beyond which lies the @entity36 cloud			1
there are three theories for how the inner @entity36 cloud could have formed			2
one is a rogue planet could have been tossed out of the giant planet region and perturbed objects out of the @entity34 on its way			0
this could have been ejected or still be in the distant solar system today			2
the second claims a close stellar encounter could put objects into the inner oort cloud region , while the third theory suggests inner oort cloud objects are extra-solar planets captured by other stars that were near our sun in its birth cluster			0
the total population of the inner oort cloud is likely bigger than that of the @entity34 and main asteroid belt			0
2012 @entity8 was first observed in november 2012 and announced earlier today			2
it is the most distant dwarf planet to be found orbiting our sun. it is approximately 280 miles wide ( 450km ) and orbits beyond the comet - rich @entity34 in a region at the very edge of the system called the @entity36 cloud			1
2012 @entity8 is around half the diameter of dwarf planet @entity72 , discovered a decade ago , and lies 80 times further from the sun than the @entity1			1
the similarity in the orbits for @entity72 and 2012 @entity8 points to an as yet undiscovered ' @entity13 '			1
the two dwarf planets are among of thousands of objects believed to form the inner @entity36 cloud and were found to have a similar orbit , suggesting the presence of a planet up to 10 times the size of @entity1			1

the motion of 2012 @entity8 stands out compared to the steady state background stars and galaxies the observable solar system is divided into three distinct regions including the rocky terrestrial planets such as @entity1 , the gas giants like @entity31 and @entity32 , and the icy @entity34 objects - beyond which lies the @entity36 cloud			1
dr @entity122 , of the @entity87 , said : ‘ the search for these distant inner oort cloud objects beyond @entity72 and 2012 @entity8 should continue as they could tell us a lot about how our solar system formed and evolved			1
' the researchers used a @entity130 ( @entity131 ) in the @entity132 to discover 2012 @entity8			2
they then used the nearby @entity134 telescope to determine its orbit and obtain detailed information about its surface			0
the dwarf planet @entity72 , artist 's illustration pictured , was discovered in 2003			2
it has a similar orbit to the newly discovered 2012 @entity8			1
the @entity87 study indicates the potential presence of an enormous planet , up to 10 times the size of @entity1 , is possibly influencing the orbit of these two dwarf planets from the sky , researchers were able to use @entity131 to calculate about 900 objects with orbits similar to @entity72 and 2012 @entity8			1
‘ some of these inner oort cloud objects could rival the size of @entity156 or even @entity1 , ’ said dr @entity122			0
‘ this is because many of the inner oort cloud objects are so distant even very large ones would be too faint to detect with current technology , ’ continued dr @entity122			0
both @entity72 and 2012 @entity8 were found near their closest approach to the @entity162 but they both have orbits at which point they would be too faint to spot			2
the findings are published in the journal @entity167			0
dr @entity86 , of the @entity87 said : ' this is an extraordinary result that redefines our understanding of our solar system , ' stock illustration pictured			0
the dwarf planets sit at the very edge of the system in a region known as the @entity36 cloud			1

researchers have discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 @entity8
it was spotted orbiting in a similar formation with up to 900 other objects
discoveries were made on the edge of our solar system in the @entity36 cloud
the similar orbits suggest a larger planet , dubbed a @entity13 because of its size , may be creating a shepherding effect on these objects
