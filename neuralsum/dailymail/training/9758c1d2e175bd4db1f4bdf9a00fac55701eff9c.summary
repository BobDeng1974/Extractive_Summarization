by @entity0 published : 03:02 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 03:03 est , 1 june 2013 thousands of new cases of kidney stones every year are caused by ignorance or denial of the need to drink three litres of water a day , according to a leading doctor			1
@entity8 , a consultant urological surgeon at @entity9 , said a lack of awareness about the dangers of dehydration was responsible for an annual increase in renal stone admissions , including among young people in their twenties			1
' the number of people admitted to hospital suffering severe pain and discomfort due to kidney stones is increasing by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent every year , ' he said			1
the @entity25 population 's ignorance of the need to drink three litres of water a day is leading to more cases of kidney stones , says a leading doctor ' over the past decade , the number of hospital admissions for renal stones in the @entity25 rose by 63 per cent to more than 80,000 and there is no sign of these numbers letting up			1
' kidney stones develop when crystals of salt gather into lumps and are not flushed out of the body due to a lack of adequate hydration , often lodging in the urinary system 's tubes			0
they can cause severe abdominal and groin pain which , in many cases , can only be corrected through surgery			0
the condition affects about 10 to 20 per cent of men and 3 to 5 per cent of women between the ages of 30 and 60			2
at @entity9 , the number of patients admitted to hospital every month has almost doubled - a trend mr @entity8 said would continue without intervention			2
' the only way to drive this down is to drive home the message that healthy lifestyle , diet and fluid intake is the best way to prevent the development and recurrence of stones , ' he said			0
the condition affects around 10 to 20 per cent of men and 3 to 5 per cent of women between the ages of 30 and 60 ' with evidence that 50 per cent of patients treated are likely to have a recurrence within ten years , largely due to complacency around hydration within a few years of having surgery , we know we face an uphill battle to change the national mindset , but we must make a start			2
' mr @entity8 said all adults should aim to drink between two to three litres of water a day , while former stone patients should maintain a daily intake upwards of three litres to avoid recurrence			0
he has also called for the introduction of a screening programme for all high risk patients - those with diabetes , gout or inflammatory bowel disease - and regular monitoring of people who suffered their first incidence of stones under the age of 25 .			0
