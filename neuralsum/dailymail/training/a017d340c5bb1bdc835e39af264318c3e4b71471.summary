by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 4 june 2013 the 61 - year - old has accused the @entity2 of ' destroying his career ' a former diplomat has won £ 320,000 damages after the @entity2 suspended him when he was wrongly accused of touching the bottom of a senior politician 's wife			1
@entity9 was ' our man in @entity11 ' until he was suspended in 2008 after his superiors confronted him with the allegation made by an opposition politician from the commonwealth state			1
last month , the @entity16 ruled that the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) was wrong to suspend him from his post as high commissioner with immediate effect - a decision that ultimately cost him his ambassadorial role and destroyed his working life			1
the 61 - year - old today accused the @entity2 of ' destroying his career ' after the government agreed to pay him £ 320,000 - along with the six - figure legal costs of the case			1
mr @entity9 accused the @entity2 of trying to ' outspend ' him with taxpayers ' cash during the legal battle as he celebrated mr justice @entity30 's order that he should receive £ 150,000 up front towards his legal bills			1
the court heard mr @entity9 was summoned before an @entity2 mandarin while on leave in june 2008 and hit with accusations that he had a ' bullying ' management style and ' displayed inappropriate behaviour towards women at social functions '			2
it emerged that the claims of inappropriate behaviour arose from a @entity11 politician who claimed that mr @entity9 touched his wife 's rear at a social gathering			1
the accusation - branded ' unfounded and scurrilous ' by mr @entity9 's @entity49 , @entity50 - was ultimately rejected after an @entity2 disciplinary probe			1
but , by then , it was too late to reinstate mr @entity9 in the @entity54 state and in subsequent years he found himself increasingly sidelined in professional terms			0
the @entity2 ( @entity57 office pictured ) will pay £ 320,000 in damages and a further £ 150,000 on account of mr @entity9 's legal costs bills his lawyers argued the conduct of the @entity2 showed a complete lack of consideration for the welfare of a loyal employee			1
the sexual misconduct allegations were eventually found to be baseless ; however , the nature of his withdrawal , led to media intrusion and caused immense distress to mr @entity9 and his family			1
as a result mr @entity9 never returned to work and in due course had to retire after a long period of sick leave			0
the prime minister of @entity11 , the @entity79 @entity78 was a witness in the case			0
he described mr @entity82 as ' one of the best high commissioners we have had in @entity11			0
i found him to be a consummate diplomat : intelligent , well - informed and an entertaining host '			0
he added that he and his wife , @entity88 , count mr @entity82 as a personal friend who they were pleased to have at their wedding in 2009			0
other senior members of the local and expatriate communities in @entity11 praised mr @entity9 equally highly and he has been particularly warmly welcomed back to @entity11 in recent years by his many friends there , including amongst the remaining local staff of the @entity97			2
the prime minister of @entity11 and other senior members of the local and expatriate communities in the country praised mr @entity9 highly speaking after the hearing , mr @entity9 said : ' it has been a long battle to clear my name and naturally i 'm pleased , as are my whole family , that the judgment has gone in my favour and indeed today 's orders have gone as we asked			1
' i would just say that it seems very unfair that one of the offices of state is using and continuing to use taxpayers ' money to outspend an individual			0
' it is more than ironic that the government is abolishing legal aid for civil actions and yet it is using taxpayers ' money to try and destroy me and in the full knowledge that my health can not begin to recover until it is over			0
' to have my career at its pinnacle and my future prospects destroyed so wrongly and , it seems , on a whim , made me unwell and i have had to go through this for five years now			0
' mr @entity9 , of @entity130 , @entity131 , said the @entity2 's failure to back him triggered a major mental breakdown , leaving him depressed and unable to work			2
he argued that superiors failed to ' hear his side of the story ' before imposing the suspension , despite his 40 years ' service as a diplomat , including previous tenure at the high commissioner in the @entity143			2
last month , mr justice @entity30 ruled that the @entity2 ' acted in breach of contract and in breach of its duty of care in withdrawing mr @entity9 from his post without affording him fair treatment ' and that the ex-diplomat was entitled to compensation for his resulting losses			2
today , the judge approved an agreed order whereby mr @entity9 will receive £ 320,000 damages			1
the @entity2 will also pay £ 150,000 on account of mr @entity9 's legal costs bills , which have yet to be finally assessed and could be much greater than that			1
@entity160 , for the @entity2 , said it planned to challenge the judge 's ruling in the @entity163			2
@entity9 's solicitor , @entity165 , said outside court during the case : ' my client is naturally pleased that justice has prevailed after what have been five long and hard - and very costly - years			0
' he wishes to thank his wife @entity172 in particular , for her unswerving love and support throughout ; his legal team for seeing at the outset the apparent injustice of his treatment in terms of the law , and for working so hard to address this ; each and every one of his witnesses whose belief in justice was very evident ; and his many friends and well wishers in @entity11 , in the @entity187 , and indeed literally across the world			0
' i hope that the @entity2 will be investigating the matter with those responsible for the decisions so wrongly made and taking action in order to ensure that such blatantly unfair and damaging treatment is not repeated			0
