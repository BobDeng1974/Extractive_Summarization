the chancellor weighed in to the row over the handling of the @entity4 ’s finances last night , branding criticism of the @entity6 ‘ unfair ’			1
@entity7 spoke as several @entity9 mps yesterday accused the @entity10 of ‘ meanness ’ and ‘ grandstanding ’ in a report in which it criticised courtiers for failing to balance the books and leaving dozens of royal residences in a state of disrepair			1
‘ i think the @entity10 chair is being unfair to the way the @entity6 has managed its finances , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
chancellor @entity7 said criticism of the @entity24 's finances was ' unfair ' after a committee of mps said the @entity4 should rent out her palaces ‘ they ’ve lived within a frozen budget over the last years and indeed the cost to the @entity24 for the taxpayer has come down quite sharply over the last couple of decades			1
’ the committee ’s chairman @entity33 had said the @entity4 should open up @entity35 to the public for longer and consider money - spinning ventures such as renting it out for commercial events			1
@entity40 mp @entity33 , who chairs the pac , said people were reluctant to criticise the royal finances but yesterday mr @entity7 said her committee appeared to have ignored significant savings made by the @entity24 in recent years			1
he added : ‘ let ’s not forget , not only are they a very important part of our constitution , but they are a huge attraction for tourists all around the world – the @entity24 generate a huge revenue for this country			0
’ senior royal aides said the backlog of building works has come about because of a real - terms squeeze on their funding of up to 60 per cent over the past 20 years			2
they were backed by several @entity9 mps , including @entity62 who said it was ‘ bizarre ’ the committee was focusing on royal expenditure of about £ 35million rather than government spending of £ 700billion			1
‘ one has to wonder if it is possible that the reason they are spending so much time on such a trivial sum is because of the opportunities it affords for grandstanding , ’ he said			0
‘ there is a meanness in saying this is all very expensive – it is not			0
’ @entity80 said : ‘ what i am totally against is this out - and - out yearly attack of the @entity24 because of who they are			0
' they are great for @entity85 , the @entity85 people love them			0
i actually felt quite embarrassed listening to @entity33 reel off the list of repairs that need doing to the royal buildings that we have not funded as a country , because what the @entity24 does for us is beyond explanation			2
‘ they put this little island of @entity99 on the world map			0
’ repair work : commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money - spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency @entity9 mp @entity107 said : ‘ i am sure the idea of opening up public access more will be looked at , but by the time the cost of extra security and so on has been included i doubt it would make much difference			1
‘ what is needed is a proper consideration of the royal finances ... after years in which the @entity117 was frozen by @entity119 and @entity120			0
’ the report highlighted what is claimed to be repeated overspending by palace officials , forcing them to repeatedly dip into the @entity4 ’s reserves			0
it also made great play of the fact 40 per cent of royal property – including @entity35 and @entity130 – are of ‘ below acceptable ’ standard			0
@entity40 ’s mrs @entity33 told the @entity132 she was shocked by the ‘ complacency ’ of palace staff , adding that they ‘ are not serving the monarch well at all ’			1
she also asked why , given the backlog of works , £ 1.1million of public money was found to renovate the @entity139 and @entity140 of @entity142 ’s home at @entity143 as well as an apartment for @entity145			2
in need of repair : the backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £ 50million to restore the @entity4 ¿ s @entity151 residence ( pictured in 2007 ) and other historic buildings tourist attraction : @entity35 has been open to the paying public for around two months each summer since 1993 portfolio : the @entity156 encompasses about 360 buildings including @entity130 ( pictured ) , @entity158 , @entity159 and parts of @entity143 venue : a state banquet at @entity130 ( left ) , and the interior of @entity35			1
