the @entity1 military has deployed its first laser weapon ever to be used in combat			1
the science fiction made real armament is seven years in the making and comes at a cost of $ 40 million			0
dubbed the 30 - kilowatt - class @entity9 , the devices was installed onto the @entity10 in august , where the warship has been patrolling with it ever since			1
@entity15 officials say the weapon can set fire to targets at the speed of light			1
those targets include aerial drones , speed boats and swarm boats , all potential threats to warships in the @entity26 , where the @entity27 , a floating staging base , is deployed			1
@entity29 : the @entity15 officially launched the @entity9 in august , the first ever laser combat weapon @entity31 reports that the system was given the okay for use in the field after passing a series of at - sea tests			1
' i have to take it out and get it wet , and the @entity26 's a pretty tough environment , ' chief of naval operations admiral @entity38 said			2
for the @entity15 , it 's not so much about the whiz - bang technology as it is about the economics of such an armament , which costs pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and smart bombs , and the weapons can be fired continuously , unlike missiles and bombs , which eventually run out			2
the weapon has several power levels			0
the laser weapon system ( @entity58 ) prototype combines light beams from six commercial , off - the - shelf solid - state welding lasers			1
each beam has a power of 5.5 kilowats , to create a laser with a total power of round 33 @entity67			0
the light from the six lasers is said to be incoherently combined because the individual beams are not merged into a true single beam ( i.e. , the individual beams are not brought in phase with each other )			0
speed of light : @entity15 officials say the weapon can set fire to targets at the speed of light			2
those targets include aerial drones , speed boats and swarm boats , all potential threats to warships in the @entity26 , where the @entity27 , a floating staging base , is deployed the laser actually uses six separate , commercial welding lasers that combine into a more powerful series of beams that can set fire to moving targets although the beams are quite close to one another , they remain separate and out of phase with each other , and are steered and focused by the beam director so that they converge into a single spot when they reach the intended target			1
coherently combining the six beams into a true single beam ( i.e. , one in which the six beams are “ phase locked ” ) would require a system with more - complex internal optics and electronic control systems			0
source : @entity112 @entity26 : the laser system is mounted aboard the @entity10 , which is patrolling the @entity26 and plans to use the weapon to fend of troublesome @entity118 ' swarm ' forces that use several smaller boats to attack much larger vessels it may be used as a ' dazzling ' warning shot to deter enemies or turned ' all the way up to lethal ' said chief of naval research rear admiral @entity125			1
' the weapon 's range remains classified			0
shooting the laser costs about $ 1 per shot , according to the @entity15 's july 31 report			2
just like in the movies , the @entity15 's laser directs a beam of energy that can burn through a target or fry sensitive electronics			2
unlike the movie , the laser beam is invisible to the human eye			0
the targeting system locks onto the target , sending a beam of searing heat			0
the @entity15 hopes that the laser will be invaluable in combating the small @entity118 fast boats and surveillance drones that harass @entity1 vessels in the area			1
this earlier iteration of the weapon is one of multiple prototypes tested			0
the current prototype was give the okay for use in the field after at - sea testing			0

the solid - state laser weapon system is designed to target what the @entity15 describes as ' *asymmetrical* threats '
those include aerial drones , speed boats and swarm boats *--* all are potential threats in the @entity26 , *specifically* from @entity118 forces
the system is aboard the @entity10 , which has been patrolling with the weapon since late august
