@entity7 and @entity9 photo manager for the @entity11 @entity10 said in a tweet that he had seen the # bringbackourhumvee meme on websites and twitter accounts supporting terrorist group @entity16 ( @entity16 )			2
the hashtag is a play on the # bringbackourgirls campaign to rescue the 276 @entity21 girls being held captive in @entity21 by @entity2 militant group @entity22			1
the @entity21 girls never were rescued despite high profile displays of support for military intervention from the first lady and celebrities like @entity49			2
tweets trolling the @entity5 with # bringbackourhumvee refer to a truck of @entity52 - made humvees @entity16 reportedly confiscated last week in @entity3			1
@entity16 happened upon the humvees as well as bulldozers , tanks , helicopters and weapons that were left behind by the @entity3 troops when they retreated from their posts as insurgents took the city of @entity62			2
the @entity63 reported last thursday that the terrorist group had transported the humvees and other materials it had captured to @entity67 , where it is also at war with that country 's government			0
photos of the humvees being captured that were posted to twitter could not be verified but the pictures are consistent with reports coming out of the region			0
this image made from a video posted by @entity81 , a group supporting the @entity83 breakaway @entity16 ( @entity16 ) on wednesday , june 12 , 2014 , which has been verified and is consistent with other @entity85 reporting , shows a militant standing in front of a burning @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity3 the first lady has become increasingly involved in policy making decisions at the @entity5			1
today she advocated for comprehensive immigration reform at a special naturalization ceremony at the @entity95 in @entity96 first lady @entity27 congratulates a new @entity52 citizen after a naturalization ceremony for 50 new @entity52 citizens held today in @entity96 at the time of the seizure , the @entity52 had made no moves to prevent the terrorist group from taking any more ground , and the president had made it clear that he would not send @entity52 forces in to defend the @entity3			1
since then the president has sent the @entity110 aircraft carrier with its usual battleship escort , @entity112 , an amphibious transport ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters , as well as 275 armed military personal into @entity117 to protect @entity119 personnel and @entity52 assets as they are moved to safer locations			0

this afternoon the president sent in armed @entity128 fighter jets to do surveillance			0
meanwhile , the battle between the @entity3 army and @entity16 blazed on as the terrorist group attacked the country 's largest oil refinery on tuesday night , setting it aflame			1

last month @entity27 and other celebrities posted tweets of themselves holding signs asking the @entity21 army to # bringbackourgirls
@entity27 did not begin the campaign to get rescue the 275 girls who were *abducted* by @entity2 militant group @entity22 , but she became the face of the initiative after she spoke out in support of it

the tweets refer to @entity52 - made *vehicles* and weapons seized by the @entity16 last week after the @entity3 army retreated
