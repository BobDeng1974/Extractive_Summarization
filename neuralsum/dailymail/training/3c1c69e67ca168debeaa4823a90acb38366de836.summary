by @entity0 approved : most of those being granted passports arrived in 2008 more than two million immigrants have been granted @entity6 citizenship since 2000 , it can be revealed			1
in the past year alone , a record 204,541 requests for a @entity6 passport were rubber - stamped by the @entity10 , official figures show			1
this is the equivalent of one migrant being given citizenship every two - and - a - half minutes – the fastest rate in history			0
it means the total number given out since the turn of the century now stands at 2,053,396			1
campaigners say the face of @entity6 society has been changed for ever in just 13 years			0
the main beneficiaries are from @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26			0
once approved , new citizens are treated in the same way as anybody else with a @entity6 passport , including no restrictions on access to housing , benefits or the jobs market			1
sir @entity36 , chairman of @entity37 , said the figures were ‘ the inevitable consequence ’ of @entity41 ’s deliberate policy of mass immigration			1
the majority of those currently being given passports arrived in 2008 or earlier			1
normally , they qualify for citizenship after living and working in the @entity6 for five years , with officials only able to block those engaged in criminality			0
sir @entity36 said : ‘ some four million foreign immigrants have arrived since 1997 of whom , so far , half appear to have qualified for citizenship			1
after being in the country for five years immigrants are offered indefinite leave to remain , unless they have committed a crime ‘ however , nobody seems to have the slightest idea how to integrate these people into our society in such a short time			2
’ the two million new citizens are entitled to vote in general elections , and critics , including @entity37 , have long insisted @entity41 adopted a deliberate policy of mass immigration for political reasons			1
they cite remarks by former @entity41 speech writer @entity69 , who boasted the aim of its immigration strategy was to ‘ rub the @entity74 ’s nose in diversity ’			1
the latest revelations , based on the @entity10 ’s own figures , come at a time when the @entity79 are battling to bring immigration under control			2
officials are now approving citizenship bids faster than at the height of @entity41 ’s open - door policy , in 2009 , when a then - record 203,789 were rubber stamped			1
the figures also shed new light on ministers ’ claims that two - thirds of new jobs are going to ‘ @entity6 workers ’			0
they point to the fact that , over the past year , the number of @entity6 nationals in work has risen by 208,000 – compared with an increase of 98,000 in the foreign workforce			1
but much of this increase is down to people who were born abroad being handed @entity6 passports , rather than @entity6 - born people finding work			2
if the figures are recalculated based on a person ’s place of birth , only 98,000 new jobs have gone to people born in @entity6			0
the vast majority – 204,000 – were born overseas			0
the numbers given permission to settle permanently , the last stage before applying for a passport , also rose by nine per cent in the year to june , to 153,000			1
there are three main routes to @entity6 citizenship , which was granted to only 82,210 people in 2000			0
last year 204,000 jobs were taken by people born overseas , compared with 98,000 @entity6 nationals the main one is residence			2
after living here for a fixed - period of time – normally five years – migrants apply for indefinite leave to remain			0
last year , 111,637 qualified in this way			2
significant numbers of passports were obtained through marriage to a @entity6 citizen , at 42,048 , or by being the child of a @entity6 national , 45,772			2
in the previous year , to june 2012 , 179,697 passports were given out – 14 per cent fewer			1
migrants must also pass the life in the @entity6 multiple choice test – recently condemned as a ‘ bad pub quiz ’ by a @entity140 academic			0
dr @entity141 said the latest version fails to mention gcses or a-levels , or ‘ practical necessities ’ such as how to report a crime			0
home secretary @entity147 has been battling to get net migration – the number of people arriving in @entity6 , versus those leaving – under control			2
ministers have promised to reduce it to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by the next election			0
it had been falling steadily and was 153,000 in the year to september 2012			2
but , in a blow to the government , it has risen to an estimated 176,000 a year			1
the rise was driven by a drop in the numbers leaving , from 351,000 to 321,000 in the year to december 2012 , the @entity164 said , while the number of arrivals fell from 566,000 to 497,000			1
last night a @entity168 party spokesman said : ‘ this shows we ’re still seeing the consequences of @entity41 ’s open - door immigration policy			1
we are tightening the rules and have cut net migration by a third since 2010			0
’ the @entity10 said : ‘ @entity6 citizenship is a privilege , not a right			0
we are toughening up language requirements for naturalisation and latest figures show applications for citizenship are falling			0
immigration is at its lowest for a decade			0
