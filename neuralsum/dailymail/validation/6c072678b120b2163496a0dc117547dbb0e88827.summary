being in the right place at the right time is a mark of a successful @entity4 driver — a truism that will almost certainly lead @entity6 to agree a new deal at @entity8 , possibly within the week			1
the double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to @entity13 in the early years and then moving to @entity8 for the 2013 season , despite the aristocracy of @entity17 motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team			1
the importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after sunday ’s @entity23 , when he saw @entity25 on the top step after the @entity28 ’s own successful move from @entity29 to @entity30			2
@entity6 sits on the podium alongside @entity25 after he claimed his first victory for @entity30 @entity6 , out of contract at the end of the season , says his new @entity8 deal will be completed this week @entity6 , who finished second , also thought of @entity37 , whose career management has been disastrous since he left @entity39 in 2005 , the year he won the last of his two world titles			1
the @entity41 then walked out on @entity13 when he could have won a third championship , went back to @entity39 as a stop - gap , joined @entity30 while it was moribund and returned to @entity13 this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners @entity45			1
@entity37 managed less than half of sunday ’s race before a cooling problem intervened			0
@entity25 , in only his second race for @entity30 , won in the car @entity37 had just vacated			2
‘ it ’s nice to see @entity30 back up , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i sat next to @entity25 and thought to myself , “ what is @entity37 thinking ? ” i remember when i left @entity13 and came here , we were better the next year			0
i had a good feeling then , but he ’s almost done the opposite of what i did			0
it could have been him today			0
it ’s just strange how things turn out			0
@entity6 finished behind race - winner @entity25 in @entity65 but still remains in the lead of the world championship @entity6 led @entity25 off the start - line at the @entity69 @entity23 but eventually lost out to the @entity28 ‘ @entity13 are a fantastic team			1
it looks bad now but i ’m sure they ’ll get it together			0
before you know it , it will be the three of us fighting , i ’m pretty sure			0
’ @entity37 ’s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted @entity78 as the @entity28 approached his first retirement in 2009			0
@entity6 , 30 , does not want to fall into the same trap , and says he is ready to sign a new contract with @entity8 for three more years beyond this season			1
the tantalising prospect of his joining @entity30 , where he is hugely admired by president @entity84 , seems remote			2
they have @entity25 and @entity6 is already part of a top team			2
no matter sunday ’s result — @entity6 beaten on pure pace by @entity25 ’s @entity30 — mercedes are the team of the moment			1
asked about signing for @entity30 , @entity6 said : ‘ no , do n’t be silly			1
my contract at @entity8 should be done this week			1
there ’s no reason why not			0
honestly , it ’s 99.6 per cent done			2
’ @entity6 is expected to earn more than his current annual £ 20million salary when he pens his new deal the exact terms of drivers ’ contracts are kept secret , but it is thought that @entity6 will get more than his current annual £ 20million salary , though probably not match @entity25 ’s deal at @entity30 , which could be worth up to £ 35m if he collects all his bonuses and extras			1
the @entity8 board want their team to be cost - efficient and will not pay the @entity106 even for a driver of @entity6 ’s talent			1
as well as tying up the contract , @entity8 will spend the fortnight before the next race in @entity112 responding to the @entity30 challenge			1
it is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in @entity116 will favour @entity8 , but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony			2
‘ i do n’t think @entity30 ’s win is a one - off , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i do n’t think they were lucky or it was a fluke			0
there ’s always talk that they are easier on their tyres			0
‘ i think we ’ll manage			0
we ’ve got a great group of people , a great approach , and from this we ’ll take a step back			0
‘ second for me and third for @entity133 ( @entity134 ) is still good but they ’re too close to us in the championship , so we ’ll work very hard to analyse			2
it was not a kick ; it was a pinch			0
we have now got a race on our hands			0
’ that is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams .			2
