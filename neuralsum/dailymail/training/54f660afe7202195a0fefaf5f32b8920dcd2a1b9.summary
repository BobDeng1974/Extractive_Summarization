by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 is expected to be announced as @entity3 's new manager this week , but what are the salient points to take away from his appointment ? @entity7 's @entity0 has been over in @entity8 this week and talks through five things we are set to learn about the @entity12 head coach			1
looking ahead : @entity1 is ready to be announced as the new @entity3 manager this week press conferences are unlikely to be boring @entity1 press conferences are punctuated by extended periods of silence where he stares down his inquisitor , seemingly attempting to unnerve with his steely gaze			1
at saturday ’s press conference , one @entity12 journalist idly asked @entity1 how he would be spending his two - day break from @entity8 ’s @entity24 training camp			1
‘ i do n’t ask you how you are spending your weekend , so why should i tell you ? ’ the manager snapped back			2
‘ he always feels like he ’s being attacked , ’ one @entity12 football journalist remarked , ‘ so he is constantly on the defensive			2
he lacks the personal skills of someone like @entity32			2
but you ’re in for an entertaining season			2
’ @entity1 has a stern manner and according to one @entity12 journalist who has been reporting on football in the @entity8 for 30 years , his brusqueness extends to his personal life			1
‘ he has two grown up daughters , ’ the journalist said , ‘ and they still address him very formally			0
there is no casual conversation with @entity45			0
’ it 's not all smiles : the @entity8 head coach 's press conferences are very rarely boring affairs talent : @entity3 hotshot @entity52 could be handed a chance under the new boss next season youngsters will get their chance as a former pe teacher , @entity1 is well - versed in handling young people , although one imagines he was probably the strictest teacher at his school			1
on saturday he gave starts to three of the youngest members of his @entity64 squad			0
@entity1 selected @entity65 , @entity66 ’s 20 - year - old defender , to take to @entity67 despite him being previously uncapped			1
@entity69 ’s @entity68 , 20 , also started and both sparkled at times			0
@entity71 , @entity66 ’s highly rated 22 - year - old playmaker played the superb pass that led to @entity74 ’s equaliser			1
@entity1 ’s trust in youth will come as welcome news to @entity3 ’s thrusting youngsters , including 18 - year - old @entity52 who scored twice on his debut in the 3 - 1 defeat of @entity81 earlier this month			1
@entity74 will be a @entity1 favourite it is obvious simply from observing the way they interact that there is a lot of respect , even warmth , between the pair			1
@entity74 was among the first to shake @entity1 ’s hand after the final whistle			1
it was also notable that @entity1 - who usually refrains from mentioning individual players for plaudits or criticism - singled @entity74 out for praise in the post match press conference			1
the striker is already very highly regarded by @entity1 but his exquisitely taken goal to level proceedings at the @entity100 will have only enhanced his reputation with the manager			1
@entity74 will feature prominently in @entity1 ’s plans at @entity104			1
‘ it has been a tough year , ’ said @entity74 beforehand			1
‘ for the first time in my career i wo n’t be playing in @entity108			0
’ @entity1 will aim to soften that blow by aiming for the top four or higher next season			2
partnership : @entity74 shares a special bond with @entity1 and will be handed major responsibility he ’ll probably be able to devote himself to @entity3 sooner than he ’d like @entity8 have an even tougher ask than @entity113 to get to the latter stages of the @entity64 after being drawn in the ‘ group of death ’ with @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
if they come second in the group , they will probably face @entity67 on their home soil			0
they were missing star names @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 on saturday night but judging by the lacklustre performance in their absence , a meeting with the hosts would be one step too far			0
@entity1 could find himself swapping the sun , sea and sand of @entity67 for the charms of @entity140 sooner than he would like			2
close knit : @entity142 has flourished as @entity1 's assistant with the @entity12 national team @entity146 demeanour @entity1 is not one for patrolling the technical area			1
he has no obvious affectations , no @entity150 - style gum chewing or @entity152 crouching			0
but his special notebook was ever - present			0
‘ i always have it with me in the dug - out and it attracts a lot of remarks , ’ @entity1 has said			2
‘ for me , it ’s an extremely valuable aid , so it ’s not important what other people think			0
first i always jot down the collective mistakes that go against the pre-planned tactics			0
that ’s the most important aspect			0
@entity164 , i always note down individual mistakes , of course			0
' this way i have a logical sequence of aspects about which i can talk to the players during the interval			0
that ’s why i find a list so useful			0
the chance of forgetting something important is negligible			0
’ distinctive : @entity1 does n't have a dugout trademark like @entity152 but still makes himself heard			2

@entity1 is likely to hand @entity74 a senior role at @entity104
the @entity8 manager is an *advocate* of youth
@entity3 startlet @entity52 will be *encouraged* by @entity1 's *policies*
