by @entity0 published : 09:22 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 11 january 2013 these incredible portraits were created by an artist who fired bullets from a .22 calibre rifle through sheets of aluminium at point blank range			1
@entity8 began using the innovative technique to shoot images of various animals but has now decided to make portraits of people which he says requires more detail , and skill			1
his work involves painting 4ft by 4ft sheets of aluminium white and taking them into the forest near his home , where he fires up to 3,500 bullets through them			1
skill : @entity8 came up with his innovative style of art when he created images of various animals with his gun shots - but now shoots portraits of people innovative : mr @entity8 makes the pictures ( right ) by firing bullets from a .22 calibre rifle through sheets of aluminium at point blank range ( left ) talent : the artist 's work - including this picture of a rabbit - requires a large amount of preparation and concentration imaginative : mr @entity8 said he came up with the unusual style of art after growing up around guns in his native @entity51 the holes create an outline of the person and the surrounding paint peels off to form a dot - to - dot style picture			1
he uses a smaller rifle in some areas of his work to add definition			0
mr @entity8 originally fired his rifle at canvas but found the bullets were too destructive as they tore it to shreds			2
however , he now faces the danger of a richochet or bullet malfunction when standing immediately in front of the reinforced aluminium			0
owl : mr @entity8 said he uses the gun ' less as a rifle and more as a power tool to systematically create points in my images ' the 38 - year - old says his artwork ' deweaponises ' the gun he received from his dad as a @entity82 present aged 15			1
the self - taught artist was inspired by the hunting and gun culture in his home town of @entity87 , @entity51 , @entity88			1
@entity8 said : ' i grew up in the south - eastern @entity88 where the culture is tied to guns and outdoor sports in general			1
' i wanted to incorporate guns into my art for quite a while , but was never quite happy with any of my ideas			0
' i use the gun less as a rifle and more as a power tool to systematically create points in my images			2
' on average each portrait takes around 12 hours to complete , with preparation and design work adding extra time			0
the artist plans to design and create a further eight portraits which will then feature at an exhibition once completed			0
he added : ' the main difference in the people and animals images is we can recognise individual humans whereas animals are more generic			2
' with a specific person i have to make sure the image actually captures my subject 's likeness			0
i end up spending a lot of time on subtle details that may only consist of three or four bullet holes to make sure everything is right			0
' @entity125 : look closely and you can see the hundreds of bullet holes needed to create this stunning image of a bird beauty : mr @entity8 started off by firing at canvas , but found the bullets simply shredded the material so he turned to metal instead			2
pictured are an image of a stag ( left ) and an @entity137 ( right )			0
