@entity0 rained on @entity2 ’s parade , telling the @entity4 side they did not deserve to beat @entity5 2 - 1			1
the @entity5 boss was fuming after his side suffered only their second defeat in 20 games in all competitions , falling to goals from @entity12 and @entity13 after @entity14 had put the visitors ahead in the first half			1
he said : ‘ we created a chance every two minutes in the second half and they had one chance			0
@entity0 ( centre ) was fuming after @entity5 suffered only their second defeat in 20 games ‘ in the first minute of the second half @entity2 had a good chance and after we were dominating the game			1
in one counter they a shot ( from @entity28 ) deflected and maybe also @entity13 is in an offside position			1
so we are not happy and not lucky			0
’ there was a whiff of sour grapes about @entity35 ’s review of a game in which @entity2 actually had more shots on goal - six to @entity5 ’s three			1
@entity35 added : ‘ we dominated the game even with 10 men because @entity41 could not run anymore because of an injury ( after @entity5 had made their last substitution )			1
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity44 dives in vain to try as @entity12 scores the equaliser for @entity2 @entity28 's long range shot was deflected off @entity13 ' head for @entity2 's winner ‘ it is always frustrating when you lose after dominating a team			1
your disappointment is much bigger because of that			0
‘ it 's amazing we have lost			2
but you do lose games			2
we have only lost to @entity59 ( since november ) and when that happens we have to continue			0
we were the better team			0
but against @entity61 we were not , so it 's the benefit of football that the result is unpredictable			2
but for us it 's very disappointing			2
’ @entity2 manager @entity65 , who has now done the double over @entity5 this season , was bemused by @entity35 ’s reaction			1
he said : ‘ i 'd rather be lucky than good			0
yes we had to ride some pressure , but all their pressure amounted to one shot			0
we got a fantastic goal and probably could have got a third			0
‘ it ’s the first time in the club 's history ( double over @entity5 )			2
i told players before game anything in terms of creating history is worth fighting for			0
to be able to do the double everyone connected to club should be proud of it			0
' @entity14 reminded @entity35 of his worth by opening the scoring for @entity5 after 28 minutes @entity14 ( left ) celebrates with @entity86 after opening the scoring against @entity2			1

@entity5 suffered only their second defeat in 20 games
