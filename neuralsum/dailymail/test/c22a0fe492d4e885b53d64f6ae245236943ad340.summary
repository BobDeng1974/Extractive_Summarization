sometime in the next few weeks , @entity0 has a lunch appointment with sir @entity2			2
on friday he expressed a tongue - in - cheek hope that @entity2 will pay but , more pertinently , the current @entity4 manager hopes to have some genuine and tangible progress to talk about			1
@entity2 , it must be said , has waited a long time for such news			0
the @entity4 team he left to @entity10 moved only backwards while this season ’s version has only occasionally appeared genuinely purposeful under @entity13			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 revealed he is set to discuss the club with sir @entity2 soon @entity13 is preparing his side for saturday 's clash against @entity17 as they bid to finish in the top four how the @entity20 table looks ahead of april 4 now , though , towards the end of this peculiar @entity20 season , life at the business end of the table has become a little more interesting			1
successive @entity4 victories over @entity26 and @entity27 have left both those teams listing a little			1
in second , meanwhile , @entity29 , one senses , have stopped looking ahead and started to glance over their shoulder			1
on saturday , for example , a win for @entity4 over @entity17 would take @entity13 ’s team above @entity29 , who do n’t play until monday night ’s engagement at @entity39			1
then , a week on sunday , the two @entity41 teams meet			0
no wonder @entity13 was sounding perky on friday			0
all of a sudden , places two , three and four in the @entity20 have begun to look rather interchangeable and it ’s @entity4 who look in decent shape to benefit			1
‘ the comments of @entity4 legends are always important because they have a lot of fans , ’ said @entity13 on friday when asked about @entity47 ’s suggestion that the recent @entity4 performance at @entity27 was one of the best he could remember			1
@entity53 ( left ) scored twice as @entity4 won 2 - 1 at top four rivals @entity27 in the league on march 22 @entity13 knows victory over @entity17 on saturday could see them leapfrog @entity29 into second place ‘ and fans are listening to the legends so it ’s nice for @entity4			1
it ’s nice for the players , and also nice for the manager when legends are saying that			0
but i think that if , for example , sir @entity2 says that then i am more proud because he can judge as a manager much better than ex-players what is the achievement in such a game			0
‘ sir @entity2 is always on his way ( travelling ) so it ’s difficult to speak with him			0
but we have made an appointment and he shall pay - that is very important ! ’ back from a break in @entity76 with his wife , @entity13 looked ready for the challenges ahead			0
he remains cautious and understandably so			0
his team have let him down before this season and @entity4 still have each of the current top three to play between now and mid-may			1
while @entity13 says @entity4 are mathematically in the title race , he says the top - four battle is not over either nevertheless , he is aware of problems that have currently mounted in front of @entity27 ’s @entity87 since @entity4 beat his team 13 days ago and knows that defeat at @entity90 saturday lunchtime could all but end the @entity93 club ’s challenge for fourth place			1
all season @entity4 have been allowed to keep in touch with the top four simply because of other teams ’ failings			2
now @entity13 has reason to hope his team ’s improved form can take them somewhere more meaningful			0
asked if second place was now a realistic possibility , the @entity4 manager said : ‘ of course			2
i can not deny that because we have @entity29 at home next week			2
‘ we have the strongest record at home so it ’s possible			0
but @entity29 is a top team so it shall not be easy			2
‘ it ’s better to be second or third			0
i would be pleased with fourth , but i want to be first			0
and my players want to be first			0
and when it ’s not first , it ’s second			0
’ @entity27 boss @entity87 ( third right ) knows defeat at @entity90 could end their top four bid the @entity117 have fitness concerns over star striker @entity119 ( right ) ahead of the trip to the @entity121 for @entity87 and his staff , the last fortnight will have been a long one			1
defeat is always harder to deal with - to move on from - when it is immediately followed by an international break			0
if his team are to get the result they need at @entity90 on saturday they will have done very well indeed , given the absence of the suspended @entity131 and @entity132 and injury concerns over striker @entity119			1
@entity90 remain well - placed			2
they have lost one domestic game in 14 since defeat at @entity136 on @entity137 , leaving @entity139 ’s @entity29 team looking rather vulnerable in second position as they try to make something of a season that already has the word ‘ disappointment ’ written right through it			2
on friday , @entity13 conceded that it was ‘ mathematically possible ’ for @entity4 to win the league			1
meanwhile , @entity148 ( left ) will hoping to continue @entity90 's impressive league form that is a fanciful notion and he knows it but he and everybody else associated with the club would certainly enjoy the sense of @entity155 will undoubtedly feel if they find themselves looking at the backs of @entity4 ’s heads by the close of play on saturday			1
@entity29 only have themselves to blame for what may yet become something of a predicament			2
@entity4 have , by common consensus , been scratchy at best this season but if @entity29 find themselves in their wake on saturday then what does that say about them ? at the root of all this , of course , is that this remains a rather average @entity20			1
it contains only one very good side and they , @entity4 , have waned themselves a little recently			2
from a morass of mediocrity , however , somebody could yet benefit			0
@entity13 will only hope that he is on course for an interesting lunch with the one man who has seen it all , and much more , many times before .			0
