the world spewed far more carbon pollution into the air last year than ever before , with emissions spurred largely by @entity4 , the @entity5 and @entity6			1
this is according to a recent report that estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons ( 36.1 billion metric tons ) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal , oil and gas			1
that is 778 million tons ( 706 metric tons ) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year , despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases			2
that is 778 million tons ( 706 metric tons ) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year , despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases the report also said that @entity4 's per capita emissions had surpassed those of @entity31 for the first time , between 2013 and 2014			1
experts said at current rates the ' quota ' for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2 ° c of warming could be used up within 30 years			1
the report claims that the world is becoming committed to ' dangerous climate change ' if it continues this trend			0
in order to keep temperatures from rising by more than 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels , beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt , more than half the world 's fossil fuel reserves may need to be left in the ground , they said			1
emissions , which are primarily caused by burning fossil fuels , will have to decline by more than 5 per cent a year to give the world a 50/50 chance of keeping temperature rises below the 2 ° c threshold			1
@entity4 's emissions surpassed those of @entity31 for the first time , between 2013 and 2014 , the report found this map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents			1
the @entity68 report claims that no one will be untouched by climate change the world pumped 39.8 billion tons ( 36.1 billion metric tons ) of carbon dioxide last year			1
that is 778 million tons ( 706 metric tons ) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year			2
@entity4 's per capita emissions had surpassed those of @entity31 for the first time			1
the quota for the total amount of co2 released without pushing the world beyond 2 ° c of warming could be used up within 30 years			1
to prevent this , more than half the world 's fossil fuel reserves may need to be left in the ground , report said			1
emissions will have to decline by more than five per cent a year to give the world a 50/50 chance of keeping temperature rises below the 2 ° c threshold			2
this year 's increase to 40 billion tonnes puts current global annual emissions two - thirds above 1990 levels			0
@entity4 , the @entity5 , the @entity94 and @entity6 are the world 's largest emitters			2
between them , they account for 58 per cent of global carbon emissions and four - fifths of the growth in carbon output in 2013			0
the @entity104 's emissions were down 2.6 per cent , but over the longer term it ' exports ' a third of its emissions			0
this is by consuming goods and services which are produced elsewhere and once these are taken into account its carbon output has merely stabilised			0
more than half of proven fossil fuel reserves may have to stay in the ground if governments are serious about a promise made in 2010 to limit a rise in average temperatures to @entity125 ( 3.6 ° f ) above pre-industrial times , the @entity116 report by leading research institutes said			1
the stark warning that time is running out to tackle spiralling greenhouse gas emissions comes ahead of a @entity130 summit in @entity131 this week to drive action in the run - up to talks in @entity135 next year , where it is hoped a global climate deal can be secured			0
' a break in current emission trends is urgently needed , ' according to the report by experts in @entity104 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and the @entity147			0
emissions by @entity4 alone , which overtook the @entity5 as the number one carbon emitter in 2006 amid fast industrial growth , have soared to eclipse those of the @entity5 and the @entity94 combined , it said			0
professor @entity153 , director of the @entity154 at the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) , said : ' the human influence on climate change is clear			0
' we need substantial and sustained reductions in @entity161 emissions from burning fossil fuels if we are to limit global climate change			0
' we are nowhere near the commitments necessary to stay below @entity165 of climate change , a level that will already be challenging to manage for most countries around the world , even for rich nations			0
' politicians meeting in @entity131 need to think very carefully about their diminishing choices exposed by climate science			0
' professor @entity174 is one of an international team of scientists from the @entity116 , which has published the ' global carbon budget ' analysis with a prediction for emissions in 2014 as well as an assessment for carbon dioxide output in 2013			2
this year 's increase to 40 billion tonnes puts current global annual emissions two - thirds above 1990 levels , the year against which attempts to cut greenhouse gases are commonly measured			0
historic and future carbon dioxide emissions must remain below a total of 3,200 billion tonnes to make it likely temperature rises do not exceed 2 ° c , the experts said , but 2,000 billion tonnes of the quota had already been used up			1
the report comes just a day after huge number protest for greater action against climate change during the @entity199 's @entity198 on september 21 , 2014 in @entity131 at current rates the quota for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2 ° c of warming could be used up within 30 years on current rates the rest of the budget could be used up in 30 years , they said			1
@entity4 , the @entity5 , the @entity94 and @entity6 are the world 's largest emitters and between them account for 58 per cent of global carbon emissions and four - fifths of the growth in carbon output in 2013 , the annual analysis said			1
last year @entity4 's emissions grew by 4.2 per cent , the @entity5 's carbon output was up 2.9 per cent , @entity6 's emissions grew 5.1 per cent , but the @entity94 's emissions fell 1.8 per cent			1
the @entity104 's emissions were down 2.6 per cent , but over the longer term it ' exports ' a third of its emissions by consuming goods and services which are produced elsewhere and once these are taken into account its carbon output has merely stabilised			0
emissions per person in @entity4 outstripped the @entity94 for the first time , with emissions of two tonnes per person , compared to @entity31 's 1.9 tonnes , although the @entity94 , like the @entity104 , exports around a third of its emissions to places such as @entity4			2
projected temperature change from 2081 - 2100			0
for the first time , the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers			0
top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems , such as civil wars , strife between nations and refugees globally emissions are expected to increase at a higher rate in 2014 than they did in 2013 , when carbon dioxide output rose 2.3 per cent			2
professor @entity256 from the @entity257 said : ' we have already used two - thirds of the total amount of carbon we can burn , in order to keep warming below the crucial 2 ° c level			1
' if we carry on at the current rate , we will reach our limit in as little as 30 years ' time - and that is without any continued growth in emission levels			2
' the implication of no immediate action is worrying clear - either we take a collective responsibility to make a difference , and soon , or it will be too late			0
' @entity130 secretary - general ban ki - moon will host a summit on september 23 of more than 120 world leaders , hoping for ' bold pledges ' as part of work on a @entity130 deal due to be agreed in @entity135 at the end of 2015 to limit global warming .			0

the report estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons of @entity161 last year
@entity116 said this is 2.3 per cent more than previous year
@entity4 emissions have also surpassed those of @entity31 for the first time
at current rates the ' quota ' for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released before 2 ° c of warming could be used up within 30 years
they claim half of world 's fuel reserves may need to be left in the ground
