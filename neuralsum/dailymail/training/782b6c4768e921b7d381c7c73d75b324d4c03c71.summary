‘ there are many reasons why it is sensible for the @entity17 to maintain contact with retired officers , ’ mr @entity9 said			1
allegations : former military chiefs including ex-head of the @entity24 @entity23 ( left ) and admiral sir @entity25 ( right , with prince @entity26 ) are reported to have boasted about lobbying top officials to secure contracts for private firms in breach of @entity6 rules ‘ but if they are abusing that access for commercial purposes then we will have to tighten it up or maybe even shut it down			1

’ six ex-senior officers were secretly filmed discussing how to influence ministers and ex-colleagues , claiming they could help set up multi-million - pound deals for firms wanting to sell equipment to @entity50			1
