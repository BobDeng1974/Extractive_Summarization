family : @entity1 has two sons aged five and seven			0
she is pictured with them in 2010 @entity1 ’s suggestions that young women should find a boyfriend instead of going to university and have a baby by the age of 27 are ‘ rather patronising ’ to teenage girls , a top headmistress said today			1
@entity12 , head of @entity13 , a girls ’ school in @entity15 , @entity16 , said she applauded the property guru ’s point that girls should consider their futures , but said it had been spoilt by her talk of ‘ boyfriends and babies ’			1
location , location , location presenter @entity1 suggested that it was time to speak ‘ honestly and frankly ’ about fertility and the fact that it declines dramatically once a woman is in her mid- 30s			1
the 42 year old , who has two sons aged five and seven with her partner , the property developer @entity30 , told the @entity32 : ‘ at the moment , women have 15 years to go to university , get their career on track , try and buy a home and have a baby			1
‘ that is a hell of a lot to ask someone			0
as a passionate feminist , i feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue			2
’ @entity48 later went on to say : ‘ i do n’t have a girl , but if i did i ’d be saying “ @entity50 , do you know what ? do n’t go to university			2
start work straight after school , stay at home , save up your deposit - i ’ll help you , let ’s get you into a flat			0
and then we can find you a nice boyfriend and you can have a baby by the time you ’re 27			2
’ she added that women have time to work on their career after they have had children			2
‘ i do n’t want the next generation of women to go through the heartache that my generation has , ’ @entity1 said			0
‘ at the moment we are changing the natural order of things , with grandparents being much older and everyone squeezed in the middle			0
' do n’t think “ my youth should be longer ”			0
do n’t go to university because it ’s an “ experience ”			0
no , it ’s where you ’re supposed to learn something ! do it when you ’re 50 ! ’ headmistress : @entity12 said she applauded the property guru 's comments had been spoilt by her talk of ' boyfriends and babies ' but ms @entity12 said that youngsters need to make the right choices at the right time for themselves			1
‘ teenagers should always be encouraged to go to university or straight to work for the right reasons , and should be encouraged to choose the path which suits them - not the one that is likely to ensure they can buy property or have a baby by the most immediate route , ’ she said			1
‘ i would never encourage a bright teenager to ditch their university prospects for fear they wo n’t “ have it all ” in the future			0
‘ i believe having it all is a total myth - it is more a case of doing what is right for you and making the right choices at the right time for you			0
’ writing for the @entity117 website , ms @entity12 said she thought that a graduate with a good degree would be likely to be able to buy their first flat around the same age as someone who has worked from the age of 16 or 18 , if not sooner			1
‘ i applaud what @entity1 is saying in principle - that girls should consider their future and security - but i think she spoils her point by suggesting abandoning university is the way forward and her talk of boyfriends and babies is rather patronising for the generation i am preparing for university and beyond			1

@entity12 , head of @entity13 in @entity15 , @entity16 , is *unimpressed*
