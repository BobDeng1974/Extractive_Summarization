by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 10 november 2013 @entity2 mps hit out last night after the global boss of @entity4 warned that his company would ‘ reconsider ’ its future in the @entity7 if the country left the @entity9			1
@entity10 , chief executive of the @entity12 car giant , said it could pull its investment and thousands of jobs if the @entity7 voted to leave the @entity9 – despite his high praise for the firm ’s ‘ blessed ’ @entity18 factory			1
eurosceptic @entity2 mps said it was ‘ scaremongering on an industrial scale ’ by a pro-european business leader speaking to a ‘ biased ’ @entity24 with a political agenda			1
sceptical : @entity27 - born @entity10 said a @entity7 out of @entity28 is ' completely different ' to the current system they insisted that @entity4 would be more likely – not less – to invest in a @entity7 freed from the shackles of @entity33 bureaucracy			1
@entity34 accused mr @entity10 of ‘ bully - boy ’ tactics of which he should be ‘ ashamed ’ , saying his intervention into @entity7 politics was ‘ extremely inappropriate and offensive ’			1
the row erupted after @entity27 - born mr @entity10 , who also has @entity41 and @entity42 roots , unveiled @entity4 ’s new @entity7 - built @entity44 model with an effusive speech in @entity46			2
his presence was hailed by @entity4 executives as a major coup and a vote of confidence in @entity7 and the @entity18 factory which employs 6,500 people			2
but pressed later in a @entity24 interview as to whether @entity4 would pull out of @entity7 if the @entity7 voted to leave the @entity9 , mr @entity10 said : ‘ if anything has to change we ( would ) need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future			1
it will have implications , obviously			0
’ @entity62 has promised a vote on @entity9 membership in 2017 if the @entity2 win the general election in 2015			2
mr @entity10 added : ‘ you can not consider the @entity7 independent of its environment			2
if the @entity7 is part of @entity28 it ’s a completely different situation than if it is not part of @entity28			0
’ eurosceptic @entity2 mp @entity71 said : ‘ this is scaremongering on an industrial scale			1
it also smacked of left - wing leading of the witness by a biased @entity24			0
' the whole interview sounded as if it had less to do with economic reality and more to do with pursuing an @entity9 federalist agenda			0
‘ why would @entity4 want to jeopardise their success by withdrawing the billions of investment they have already made ? ’			0
but deputy prime minister @entity83 welcomed mr @entity10 ’s ‘ timely ’ warning			0
he said : ‘ as the conservative mps tie themselves up in knots in @entity87 today about their @entity28 obsessions			0
the head of @entity4 says , “ look , if you pull out of @entity28 , do n’t think that companies like mine are necessarily going to carry on investing and employing many people ”			0

@entity10 said @entity12 company would ' reconsider ' its future in @entity7
@entity2 mps *attacked* comments as ' scaremongering on an industrial scale '
