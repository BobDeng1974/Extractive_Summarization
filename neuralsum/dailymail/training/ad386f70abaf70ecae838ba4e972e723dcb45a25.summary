most people do one of two things with old video game consoles : they either leave them in an attic gathering dust to be used during rare moments of nostalgia , or they ’re sold on at a car boot sale			0
but that ’s not the case for software engineer @entity10 from @entity12 , who modified an old @entity14 ( @entity14 ) to make it capable of playing music			1
his creation , dubbed the ‘ @entity19 ’ , uses a chip within the system to make sounds - and he has shown the potential of the musical instrument by playing the @entity26 theme tune			1
using an old @entity14 console , a @entity33 controller and keys , the inventor has been able to coax out sounds from a chip in the old console and make it recreate popular music such as the @entity26 theme tune the system uses an original @entity14 console as its main ‘ board ’			1
attached to the console are keys , which in turn trigger an original @entity47 sound chip in the console to give an 8 - bit sound			1
- @entity14 console - @entity33 controller - @entity14 controller - @entity14 controller - @entity54 keyboard - @entity57 ( microcontrollers ) - @entity58 - @entity59 @entity60 - @entity61 in / out connections - @entity64 / @entity63 a @entity33 controller , meanwhile , acts as the fret for the keytar			1
‘ the project was started way back in august 2013 purely as a hobby project , ’ @entity68 , who is a musician in his spare time , told @entity70			0
‘ since then i 've spent roughly 300 hours upping my electronics skills , learning new programming languages , trying different combinations of parts and writing all the software features - not to mention writing the music ! ‘ debugging and testing took the longest time by far , and i 'm still finding bugs ! ‘ all in all it was definitely more complex than i 'd anticipated			2
’ to the get the final system up and running @entity68 reveals that the system cost ‘ a lot more than it should have ’ and he had to go through more than one console to get everything working			2
‘ luckily it did n’t blow up like one of my previous projects did ’ he adds			0
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is an 8 - bit video game console that was gradually released around the world from 1983 to 1987			1
it remains one of the best - selling gaming consoles of all time - but it 's unlikely many used it in the same way @entity68 has done amazingly , the console is also still able to play games without any problems – in fact , @entity68 said ‘ it works better than it did before i started			2
’ this is because he ‘ cleaned and replaced some of the internal contacts that had started to deteriorate ( no more blowing into cartridges required ! ) , and upgraded the audio outputs to give a much cleaner sound with less buzz			0
’ @entity68 , who was on @entity110 's @entity109 in 2012 with his equally impressive laser harp , also reveals he has some other ideas in the works , but he is n’t ready to reveal them just yet			0
‘ i have quite a few ideas that i came up with while building the @entity116 , ’ he said , ‘ but for now i 'm going to keep them under wraps			0
’ no doubt many fans of his latest effort , including @entity122 of @entity124 fame who called the invention ‘ amazing ’ on @entity127 , will be looking forward to seeing what he dreams up next .			0

software engineer from @entity12 unveiled his 8 - bit @entity19 in a video
@entity10 modified the old @entity14 console into a musical instrument
keys are attached to the system while a @entity33 controller is the ' fret '
he said the *device* not only blasts out music but also still plays games
it has taken him nearly a year , and ' *hundreds* of hours ' to finish the project
