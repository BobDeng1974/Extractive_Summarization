@entity0 and @entity1 , pictured with daughter @entity2 , want their summer born sons @entity6 to start in reception class in september a father has claimed a lack of common sense is preventing his twin boys from starting school a year later because they were born in late august			1
@entity16 ’s boys @entity8 and @entity17 turned four last summer but they put off joining lessons because they were too young			1
now they have been told that when they start school in september this year after reaching the legal age for compulsory education , they will have to go straight into @entity22 and not join reception classes with pupils just weeks younger than them			1
mr @entity16 claims @entity25 is either ‘ unaware of or ignoring ’ government guidelines in which ministers make clear children ’s interests must come first			1
the @entity30 issued guidance to schools and councils in july 2013 and last december making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group			2
summer - born children can wait until the september after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop			2
and it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be ' no barrier ' to the child then starting in reception class			1
last wednesday schools minister @entity50 backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child '			1
but on the same day as mr @entity50 addressed @entity59 , @entity25 wrote to the @entity16 family to say @entity17 and @entity8 would not be able to join the reception class in september			1
the brothers were born on august 22 , 2010 , some 11 weeks premature			0
they were due in november , which would have put them in the following school year starting in september 2015			2
mr @entity16 and his wife @entity67 , who also have a daughter @entity2 , 6 , have carried out their own research into summer born children and education start dates			1
@entity17 and @entity8 both currently attend @entity73 , @entity74			1
two years ago they asked the council to delay the boys ’ start date for a year , but still in reception			2
but last week the request was rejected , and the boys have been told they must go into year 1 in september 2015 or they risk losing a school place at @entity84 where they originally applied			0
they have since changed the application to @entity86 in @entity87			0
mr @entity16 told @entity88 : ‘ academically and emotionally , the boys are nowhere near ready to start year one – they would effectively be a year younger than many of their classmates ‘ we have produced large amounts of evidence from professionals involved in our children ’s lives , supporting our case , but the local authority has dismissed it			1
’ the @entity101 have been told they must start in @entity22			1
they have since applied to attend @entity86 in @entity87 he claims the council ’s actions ‘ clearly contradict ’ the guidelines set out by the @entity30 and is calling for a rethink as a matter of urgency			0
‘ despite the ins and outs of the issue , the basis of our request is very simple : our sons were born 11 weeks early , this should be acknowledged in the admissions process , ’ said mr @entity16 , a filmmaker and photographer			0
‘ i think this is common sense coming up against a ‘ computer says no ’ attitude from @entity25			0
‘ @entity122 and down the country , @entity121 are either unaware of or ignoring the guidelines set down by the government at a national level			0
‘ the school we have applied to – @entity86 – have indicated they understand our situation and are ready to accept the boys as we are requesting - if the places are allocated by the @entity25			0
’ a spokesman for the local authority said : ' the county council ’s policy , as the admissions authority for community and voluntary controlled schools in @entity139 , is that all children should have a school place in the september following their fourth birthday			0
' however , requests for children to be admitted out of year group are made on an individual basis taking into account all relevant information			0
' the application for @entity8 and @entity150 was considered in line with our published admissions policy			0
the evidence submitted was not ignored but carefully considered by a panel of officers			0
' education minister @entity50 backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child ' @entity30 guidance allows parents to delay their child 's schooling until the september after their fifth birthday			1
this policy , updated last spring , is designed to help children with birthdays between april 1 and august 31			0
this is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four			0
the @entity30 guidance says : ‘ an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents , local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer - born child to start school			2
' there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class '			1
but some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into @entity22 to ease pressure on places in reception			1
new government guidelines was introduced after research showed summer born children were more likely to struggle at school , do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university			2
but some councils are still sending youngsters straight into year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were ' exceptional ' circumstances			0
mr @entity50 told @entity59 that there had to be ' flexibility ' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year			1
giving evidence to the education select committee , he said : ' the key thing is flexibility , and i think that admissions authorities and headteachers do need to do what 's in the best interests of the child			0
' he added : ' if a child is very immature for their age and they are born in those summer months , and it 's the very strongly held view of the parents that the child should start school in the following september , which is when the law says they should start , i think admissions authorities should be flexible and should do what 's in the best interests of the child			2
' he stressed that councils mist include parents in discussions about when their children start school			2
but @entity254 , of the @entity253 , claimed that problems in arranging different school start times have worsened she told the committee : ' we do have a compulsory school age in @entity260 , so children should be able to start at compulsory school age			2
' she added that summer - born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into @entity22			1
' parents are being forced to enrol their child in school early , prior to compulsory school age , in order to have a reasonable chance of getting a place in their preferred schools			0

@entity16 says @entity277 is at odds with guidelines
@entity8 and @entity17 turned four last summer but they put off joining lessons
now they have been told they will have to start in @entity22 in september
@entity287 says : ' no barriers to admitting child of five to reception class '
minister @entity50 says councils must do the right thing for children
