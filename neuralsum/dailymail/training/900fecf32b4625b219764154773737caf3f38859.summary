@entity0 stole the show during @entity3 's 9 - 8 penalty shootout victory over @entity4 in the @entity6 third round on tuesday night			1
the match finished 2 - 2 after extra-time before @entity0 's shootout heroics - the @entity7 saved @entity12 's spot - kick before nervelessly slotting home the winning penalty after @entity4 goalkeeper @entity15 had struck the woodwork			1
amazingly , @entity0 was only signed as back - up to @entity18 at @entity19 in june 2013			1
after arriving on a free transfer from @entity21 , the 28 - year - old took until the end of 2013 to displace @entity18 as @entity24 1 - but he has excelled between the sticks since			1
here , @entity26 looks at the 10 best bargain - buy goalkeepers ( costing £ 1.5million or less ) in the history of the @entity29 ... @entity3 goalkeeper @entity0 strokes his winning penalty past @entity4 stopper @entity15 @entity0 celebrates after sending @entity3 through to the @entity6 fourth round he saved @entity12 's penalty earlier on in the dramatic shootout @entity34 - £ 1.5m ( @entity35 to @entity36 ) his career may not have gone quite as planned since leaving @entity36 , but ask anyone on @entity39 about @entity34 and they will rave about a goalkeeper who was quite simply brilliant for the @entity41 - and that despite him having previously turned out for @entity42 during a loan spell			1
then - @entity45 boss @entity44 had been so impressed by given at @entity35 that he decided to spend a modest £ 1.5million to bring the @entity46 international to @entity48 in 1997			0
in the almost 12 seasons given spent at @entity36 he kept 91 clean sheets in the @entity29 , in spite of the fact he was playing behind a usually dreadful back four , and represented the club in the @entity55 , @entity56 , as well as the @entity6 final to defeat to @entity58 in 1998			1
@entity34 signed for @entity36 from @entity35 for just £ 1.5million in 1997 given manages to prevent @entity60 's @entity59 from scoring during a @entity29 match in 2008 @entity62 - £ 505,000 ( @entity63 to @entity64 ) when sir @entity66 describes a transfer as the ' bargain of the century ' , then you know someone has been a success - and that was exactly what he said about @entity62 's move from @entity74 to @entity64 in 1991			1
although @entity62 arrived the season before the launch of the @entity29 ( in 1991 ) , his performances for @entity64 throughout the 1990s ensure he thoroughly deserves a place on this list having cost just £ 505,000			2
with 11 major trophies won during his time at @entity83 , @entity62 's period at the club represented one of almost total domestic domination			0
the @entity88 kept 113 clean sheets for the @entity90 in the league and , if you include later transfers to @entity94 ( free ) and @entity95 ( free ) , he averages a shutout every 0.42 @entity29 matches - a quite remarkable record			1
a player who effectively redefined the role of the goalkeeper			0
@entity62 signed for @entity64 from @entity103 side @entity63 for £ 505,000 in 1991 @entity62 ( centre ) celebrates with team - mates after winning the 1999 @entity29 title @entity107 - £ 600,000 ( @entity108 to @entity95 ) it is frightening to think that @entity107 is still only 27 years old due to what he has already achieved in the game			2
after arriving at @entity95 from @entity108 for £ 600,000 in may 2006 , @entity107 spent time on loan at @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 before eventually supplanting given as the @entity117 ' no 1 in 2010 - 11			2
despite a couple of lapses in form since - leading to him being dropped twice - @entity107 has amassed 207 @entity29 appearances , become @entity124 's undisputed first - choice keeper , won four major titles and kept more than 75 clean sheets			2
not bad for someone who has n't even turned 28 yet ... @entity107 moved to @entity95 from @entity108 in may 2006 @entity107 dives to make a save during @entity95 's @entity29 match with @entity130 this month @entity131 - £ 1.5m ( @entity132 to @entity133 ) @entity131 is now 42 and yet he is still going strong having just moved to @entity134 - his fourth @entity29 club after @entity133 , @entity136 and @entity60 - on a free transfer			1
although a household name now , when the @entity139 moved to the @entity140 from @entity132 in 1997 for £ 1.5m he was largely unknown			0
but @entity131 would soon establish himself as one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the @entity144 top flight			0
@entity131 amassed 93 clean sheets in 366 @entity29 matches for @entity133 , winning the @entity147 with the club in 2004 , before excelling at @entity136			0
a further 56 clean sheets arrived in 172 appearances for the @entity151 - plus he reached the @entity56 final with @entity133 and then the @entity56 final with @entity136			2
certainly not a bad cv , you know			0
@entity131 swapped @entity132 for @entity133 in a deal worth £ 1.5m in 1997 @entity157 ( left ) throws @entity158 over manager @entity159 following @entity133 's 2004 @entity147 triumph @entity162 ( @entity161 to @entity35 ) another goalkeeper who is still plying his trade at the top level at the tender old age of 43 , @entity157 will go down as one of the great @entity29 goalkeepers - both for his sheer longevity and his ability between the posts			2
having played 25 times for @entity161 in the @entity29 , the @entity172 was allowed to leave @entity174 to join up with @entity35 - then in the @entity175 - on a free transfer in 2000			1
a mammoth 77 clean sheets followed in 262 top - flight appearances for @entity35 as @entity157 regularly helped the @entity180 club fight off the threat of relegation			0
@entity157 would then move to @entity94 - where he would play ever single league games over his three seasons in @entity115 - and @entity130 , setting a record for the most consecutive @entity29 appearances in history ( 310 matches )			2
an extremely under - rated goalkeeper			0
@entity157 moved from @entity161 to @entity35 on a free transfer in 2000 @entity157 throws the ball out of the @entity35 goal during a @entity29 match with @entity60 @entity194 - £ 1.2m ( @entity95 to @entity195 ) with a record 170 clean sheets from 572 @entity29 appearances , @entity194 - due to the fact he has played for five different top - flight sides - was always going to make this list			1
having already performed excellently for @entity161 ( 72 clean sheets ) , @entity94 ( 21 ) , @entity3 ( 18 ) and @entity95 ( 20 ) , @entity194 left the @entity202 for the south coast and signed for @entity195 for just £ 1.2m in 2006			2
big - spending @entity195 were determined to be successful and recruited an @entity124 international who still intended to play on			0
during his four years at @entity195 , @entity194 added another 39 clean sheets and won an @entity6			0
@entity194 signed for @entity195 from @entity95 for £ 1.2m in 2006 @entity194 jumps and but can not stop @entity209 's @entity208 ( not seen ) from scoring @entity211 - £ 300,000 ( @entity212 to @entity60 ) having been recommended to then - @entity60 boss @entity213 by @entity215 goalkeeper @entity214 , @entity211 arrived at @entity216 in 1999 for a fee of £ 300,000			0
although never capped by the @entity219 national side - largely due to the presence of @entity221 - @entity211 eventually overtook @entity222 as @entity60 's @entity224 goalkeeper			0
he was even voted the @entity29 goalkeeper of the season in 2002 - 03 during an @entity228 poll			2
however , injury problems that had dogged him during his time at @entity215 returned in 2003 - 04 and , when @entity231 spent big money to bring in @entity233 in 2004 , @entity211 found himself as the best goalkeeper sitting anywhere on the bench in world football			0
despite this , @entity211 still managed 142 @entity29 appearances during nine years at @entity216 before moving to @entity130 , where he played another 19 top - flight matches			2
@entity211 arrived at @entity60 from @entity212 for £ 300,000 in 1999 the @entity242 keeper runs out to try and claim the ball during a @entity55 game against @entity245 in 2004 @entity18 - £ 100,000 ( @entity246 to @entity247 ) another old - timer still trying to get back into the first - team picture at @entity3 following @entity0 's elevation to no 1 , @entity18 spent 15 years are @entity247 before moving to @entity252			1
having arrived in @entity180 for just £ 100,000 from @entity253 side @entity246 in 1997 , @entity18 went on to keep 89 clean sheets in 379 @entity29 matches for @entity247 as they finally established themselves as top - flight regulars having endured years as a yo - yo club			1
another 19 clean sheets have followed at @entity19 since his free transfer in june 2012 and , although he is now second choice , @entity18 is still very much trusted by @entity260			1
@entity18 cost @entity247 just £ 100,000 from @entity253 side @entity246 in 1997 @entity18 throws his body in the way of a shot from @entity115 's @entity264 in 2003 @entity265 - £ 500,000 ( @entity266 to @entity42 ) the second @entity267 on the list , @entity265 has played for three different @entity29 clubs and kept 109 clean sheets - putting him 12th on the all - time @entity29 list			1
having joined then - @entity175 @entity42 from @entity103 side @entity266 in 1998 for just £ 500,000 , @entity265 established himself as the @entity42 ' @entity224 and went on to keep 36 clean sheets in 136 top - flight games for the @entity140 club			0
a further 46 shutouts have followed as @entity94 , and most recently at current club @entity280 , with the 38 - year - old serving as a worthy deputy to @entity278 at the @entity279 right now			1
@entity265 arrived at @entity42 from @entity266 for £ 500,000 in 1998 @entity265 ( right ) argues with @entity42 team - mate @entity281 during a match against @entity117 @entity283 - £ 200,000 ( @entity284 to @entity36 ) newcastle are a club who have made some awful signings down the years , but goalkeepers is one department they almost always seem to get right - and @entity283 is no exception			0
the @entity291 arrived at the club when he was just 17 in 2006 from @entity284 and made an extremely - impressive debut against @entity294 in the @entity56 that season			0
loans to @entity297 and @entity298 followed so that @entity283 could gain some first - team experience before he returned to @entity48 in 2009			0
with @entity283 and long - servant @entity300 battling for first - team duties during @entity36 's season in the @entity303 , the former eventually gained no 1 status two months into the @entity41 ' first season back in the top flight in 2010 - 11			0
since then , 37 shutouts have followed in 134 appearances - not to mention his @entity310 quarter - final penalty shoot - out heroics for @entity311 in 2014 - and he has become one of the most sought - after goalkeepers in the @entity29 right now			1
@entity283 arrived at @entity36 as a 17 - year - old and cost the club just £ 200,000 @entity283 dives at the feet of @entity294 striker @entity317 during his debut in november 2006			1
