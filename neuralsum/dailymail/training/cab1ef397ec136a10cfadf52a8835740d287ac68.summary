by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 2 september 2013 a mother - of - two who is at risk of cancer has chosen to have both her breasts removed and then reconstructed with a pioneering technique - using pig skin			1
@entity7 , 32 , has seen her mother , great grandmother and cousin all suffer breast cancer - and has an 87 percent chance of developing it herself because she carries the deadly brca gene			1
she decided to have a double mastectomy for the sake of her two young children @entity18 , five , and @entity19 , eight			1
@entity20 is preparing to have both her breasts removed and reconstructed using pig skin			2
she , has seen her mother , great grandmother and cousin all suffer breast cancer and has a high chance of developing it herself breast reconstruction usually involves using tissue from another part of the patient 's body - a practice that is painful and leaves multiple scars			1
but thanks to a pioneering operation she now has the option of having her bust reconstructed with a new technique called ' @entity41 '			2
normal implants are still used to rebuild the breast but a pig skin graft works like an internal bra - holding the implant in place and allowing natural droop of a breast			1
the procedure allows patients to have their reconstruction done in an all - in - one operation , rather than the two operations normally required			0
it also leaves the breasts more flexible and robust so patients can still enjoy sports and other physical activities			0
the graft is pigskin stripped of all pig cells so that the body does n't reject it			1
it works like an internal bra - holding the implant in place and allowing natural droop of a breast a cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous			1
doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations			0
they can occur due to substances people come into contact with			0
or , they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells			2
most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system			2
it usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer			2
but it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer			2
scientists have identified a number of these so - called ' cancer genes '			2
the first genes to be found were @entity96 1 and brca 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime			1
women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts ( and possibly ovaries )			2
ms @entity108 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , had genetic testing for the hereditary breast cancer gene @entity112 in january after her mum urged her and her sister to be tested			1
after her results came back positive , ms @entity108 , a cat breeder , took the decision to have a double mastectomy			1
she said : ' cancer is in my family			0
my mum has had it and so has my great grandma and my cousin			0
' because i carry the gene i 've got an 87 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and by the time i 'm 40 i 'll probably have to have my ovaries removed too because of the risk of ovarian cancer			1
' when i found out i had the gene i knew i had to have a double mastectomy			1
waiting for cancer to happen is not an option			0
' the graft is pigskin stripped of all pig cells so that the body does n't reject it			1
it was first developed for use in general surgery such as hernia repairs and breast reconstruction in the @entity146 and was granted approval for use in @entity149 in 2008			0
ms @entity108 , who will go under the knife this week , said : ' i did n't want the usual saline implants because i 'll be in and out of hospital a lot over the course of my life having to have them altered and more surgery			0
@entity108 had testing for the hereditary breast cancer gene @entity112 in january after her mum urged her and her sister to be tested			1
she was told she had an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer ( pictured ) ' but i researched into it and found that i could have a reconstruction using @entity41			1
it 's pig skin which is used to form a balcony and hold the implants in place as well as increase blood flow			1
' i 'm going to have both of my nipples removed too because the risk of breast cancer is still there if they leave them			1
so i 'll have to have my nipples tattooed on after surgery			0
' it 's all a bit of a frightening prospect			0
i 'll look normal to everyone else but i 'll feel like my femininity has gone			0
' i suppose i 'm going to feel a bit like a mannequin but if it gives me the confidence to face people then i 've got to do it			0
' ms @entity108 is now urging women to push for genetic testing if cancer is in their family			0
breast reconstruction after a mastectomy can be carried out either with implants or by taking skin and fat from anywhere there is surplus - typically the abdomen , buttocks or back - to tailor a new breast			1
the latter produces a soft breast that will age with the patient , but a drawback of these complex techniques is that patients are left with a significant scar from where the spare tissue was taken , meaning a longer recovery time too			0
having an artificial implant after a mastectomy is the simplest solution , with shorter recovery times			0
however , a major shortcoming is that all too often patients are disappointed with the cosmetic result — many are left with a pert , high breast without much droop and which does not match the unaffected side			0
this is because all breast implants need a covering of tissue and skin over them to help anchor them in position and to provide a more natural look — and unfortunately most of this is removed if mastectomy is necessary			2
the new pig skin technique still uses normal implants to rebuild the breast , but the animal skin graft works like an internal bra - cradling the implant and allowing some of the natural droop of a normal breast			1
the graft , known as the @entity41 graft , is pigskin stripped of all pig cells , so that the body does n’t reject it			1
with the pigskin reconstruction , the lower part of the pectoral muscle is teased off the ribs and the pigskin tissue — which looks like thick , white rice paper — is stitched to the bottom edge of the muscle			0
next , the implant is inserted and the muscle and pigskin is pulled down so it covers the implant completely ; finally , the patient ’s skin is drawn down and stitched to where the breast fold will be			2
it was first developed for use in general surgery such as hernia repairs and breast reconstruction in the @entity146 and was granted approval for use in @entity149 in 2008			0
to date , 1,200 patients in the @entity266 have had their breasts reconstructed in this way .			0

@entity7 , 32 , decided to have a double mastectomy after finding out she has an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer
the technique *soctors* are using on her , known as @entity41 , strips the animal skin of all pig cells so the human body does not reject it
the skin graft is then implanted in the body and works like an ' internal bra ' to hold the normal , *manmade* implants in place
