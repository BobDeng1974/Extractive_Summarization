by @entity0 published : 21:00 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 11 march 2013 more than 100 @entity2 will this week demand ministers rip up human rights laws which have allowed hundreds of foreign criminals to stay in @entity5			1
proposals to come before the @entity8 within days would - it is hoped - end the flood of foreign convicts escaping deportation by claiming their right to a ‘ private and family life ’			1
the changes are being put forward by a cross-party group of mps led by prominent @entity18 backbencher @entity17 and former labour home secretary @entity19			2
the relatively simple amendments to the law have gathered unprecedented levels of parliamentary support , putting huge pressure on ministers to adopt them			1
abuse : @entity2 want to stop foreign criminals staying in the country by claiming their right to a ' private and family life ' under @entity30 of the @entity31			1
file picture without the changes , @entity30 8 will carry on being abused by killers , rapists , robbers and drug dealers			0
the cases include many overseas offenders who have made successful appeals despite not having any children living in this country			0
if passed , they would send a clear message to immigration judges who have to date defied efforts to get rid of the ‘ family route ’ loophole			0
mr @entity17 , the mp for @entity48 and @entity49 , said : ‘ this change is vital to stop the flow of serious - and often vicious - criminals running rings around our deportation system , making a mockery of @entity5 justice			1
‘ there ’s a groundswell of cross-party support in favour of finally doing something about these appalling cases			0
let ’s stop talking about it , and start doing something			2
’ mp @entity17 said : ' this change is vital to stop the flow of serious - and often vicious - criminals running rings around our deportation system , making a mockery of @entity5 justice ' last year home secretary @entity70 changed the immigration rules to limit use of @entity30 by foreign criminals			1
under the 2007 @entity76 those from outside the @entity75 sentenced to at least a year in jail should face automatic deportation to their home country			0
this helped reduce the number of human rights challenges from nearly 400 to around 212 per year - of which the vast majority were @entity30 8 related			0
@entity86 , an illegal immigrant and child rapist , successfully used @entity30 8 to stay in the @entity5 but the immigration courts have made clear in a series of cases , that they would ignore the new edicts and follow their own case law - because ministers changed guidance and not primary legislation			1
ministers are thought likely to propose a similar change with a new @entity98 later this year or early next			2
but the amendment proposed this week - a straightforward nine word change to a @entity98 currently before @entity101 , would become law much sooner			1
it is backed by 93 @entity104 , giving it more backing than any previous backbench proposal in this @entity101			0
supporters include three former criminal justice ministers , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
the change would not stop criminals taking their cases to @entity115 , but it would limit them to using @entity116 of the @entity31 - which protect against anyone likely to be killed , tortured or mistreated if returned			1
among those who have successfully used @entity30 8 to stay in @entity5 are @entity86 , a sex attacker who raped and violently molested two young girls while fighting deportation on human rights grounds			1
the 40 - year - old @entity122 asylum seeker was jailed for ten years for raping a sixteen - year - old girl			0
he used his two children to stay in @entity5 - then attacked again after his release from prison			2
his victims were a four year - old girl and another aged just seven			0
it is thought there are around 4,000 overseas convicts now living in the @entity5 which the government want to remove but are blocked from doing so by human rights laws .			2

more than 100 mps back law change to end foreign criminals staying in @entity5
there is huge pressure to stop abuse of @entity143
