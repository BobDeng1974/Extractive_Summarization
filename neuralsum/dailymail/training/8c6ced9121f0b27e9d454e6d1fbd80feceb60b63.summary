two hospital workers spent four hours pinned between a highly magnetic mri machine and a metal oxygen tank			1
the 4ft tank was pulled across the room by the machine 's magnetic field at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , leaving porter @entity10 and technician @entity11 seriously injured			1
hospital authorities launched an investigation into the incident , which was reportedly exacerbated when staff found they were unable to demagnetise the machine			1
painful : two hospital staff ( pictured ) were pinned between an mri scanner and an oxygen tank in @entity8 fracture : @entity10 , 28 , reportedly misunderstood instructions to fetch an oxygen mask for the doctor the incident last month was triggered while a patient was being wheeled in for a routine scan in the magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity30 ) machine			1
the 28 - year - old porter was asked to fetch an oxygen mask but thought he was being asked to fetch a whole tank , the @entity31 reported			1
it was drawn across the room , pinning him and the technician to the machine and fracturing his elbow			1
the technician , 35 , suffered damage to his lower abdomen described in one report as a punctured bladder and severe bleeding			2
normally the incident could have been over within seconds , but the machine 's emergency shut - off switch failed to work , hospital authorities said			1
that meant the men were trapped for four hours , during which both fell unconscious and were treated for their injuries while still pinned to the machine			2
a team of rescuers was called and at one point 20 people tried to pull the cylinder out with a rope they had attached to the end , according to local reports			0
treatment : @entity65 , 35 , remained in hospital after suffering a punctured bladder eventually , they were rescued after a technician from manufacturer @entity71 managed to deactivate the magnetic field , a hospital spokesman said			1
hospital deputy director dr @entity73 said in a press statement : ' we are taking up the issue of the equipment malfunction with @entity71 in an appropriate manner			2
' one of the men has suffered a fracture in elbow and has been operated on			0
the other suffered muscular injury to the lower limbs and will take a few weeks to recover			0
' later reports suggested the switch had been disabled so it could only be operated by @entity71 employees			0
a @entity71 spokesman declined to confirm or deny that claim , but said : ' at this time , we are not aware of any systemic safety concerns with the @entity30 currently in the installed base - this was a unique incident			2
' @entity96 provides extensive training on usage of @entity30 equipment to ensure safety of patients and hospital staff ... and is taking this matter seriously			0
' mri scanners use powerful magnetic fields to manipulate protons in the water molecules which make up much of the human body			0
radio - frequency waves are then directed at the patient to determine the position of the protons and how they have ' lined up ' under the magnetic field , building up a detailed picture of different types of tissue in the body			0
the magnetic fields needed are so strong that @entity30 scanners always bear explicit warnings that they should not be kept near any metal objects , even paperclips			0
@entity30 scanners tend to have a magnetic strength of between 1.5 and 3 @entity124 - compared to just 0.005 @entity124 for a fridge magnet .			0

pair were working at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9
@entity129 @entity10 , 28 , carried the large oxygen tank into scan room
he and technician @entity11 , 35 , became pinned to instrument
hospital chiefs launched an investigation over last month 's incident
