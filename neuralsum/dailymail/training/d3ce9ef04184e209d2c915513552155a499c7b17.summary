by @entity0 there must have been many occasions when critics of controversial @entity5 mayor @entity4 have wanted to throw a bucket of ice over his head - and now he has done the job for them			2
mr @entity4 performed the stunt as part of the @entity13 charity fundraising craze that is sweeping the internet , in which people around the world pour buckets of ice water over their heads and then nominate someone else to follow suit			1
the nominee has 24 hours to comply or donate $ 100 to the charity as a forfeit			2
mr @entity4 , 45 , went through with the stunt after being nominated by former @entity38 ice hockey player @entity30 , who got his soaking last week			1
in a video posted on @entity40 , @entity30 helped the mayor 's brother , @entity41 , empty a garbage bin full of ice water over the mayor 's head			1
in the video , the mayor stands in front of a large ' @entity49 for @entity51 ' banner and says : ' hi , i am mayor @entity4			2
i have been called out by legendary @entity54 for the ice bucket challenge for @entity13			0
' turning to @entity30 , he shouts : ' @entity57 , i accept your challenge			1

' @entity30 and @entity41 appear , pick up a plastic bin emblazoned with more ' @entity49 mayor ' stickers and tip it over the his head			1
