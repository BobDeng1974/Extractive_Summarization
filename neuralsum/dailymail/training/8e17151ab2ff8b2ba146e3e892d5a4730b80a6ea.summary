paint job : @entity28 president , one of the last remaining @entity3 warships , has been transformed with a ' camouflage ' paint job by a @entity7 artist to mark the centenary of the start of the conflict artist : @entity17 ( pictured ) transformed the boat , which is permanently moored on the @entity20 , near the @entity21 , as part of the 14 - 18 now project design : the anti-submarine ship 's makeover was inspired by dazzle camouflage , in which glaring colours and geometric shapes were used to mislead enemy u-boat captains during the @entity3 also called razzle dazzle , or dazzle painting , dazzle camouflage was used not to conceal @entity45 and @entity46 ships , but to make it difficult for the enemy to estimate their range , speed and route			1
each ship was given a different dazzle pattern so that @entity7 attackers would struggle to determine the class of vessel			2
as one of the last three surviving @entity60 warships , @entity1 ( 1918 ) was itself painted in dazzle camouflage during the conflict , when it was deployed as a submarine hunter tracking down @entity7 u-boats			2
designer : @entity17 , who has used similar visual techniques in his previous works , has designed a new unique pattern for the ship , which was revealed today historic : as one of the last three surviving @entity60 warships , @entity1 ( 1918 ) was itself painted in dazzle camouflage during the conflict artwork : the ship has been covered entirely in ' dazzle camouflage ' print as part of the 14 - 18 now special commissions programme to mark the centenary of the @entity3 dazzle camouflage , used during the @entity3 , was an example of the collaboration of art with national defence			1
inspired by cubist and vorticist artworks , painter @entity86 proposed painting ships with jagged stripes and lines in a bid to cut down on the number lost to the @entity7			0
although the camouflage did not actually disguise the ships , it distorted their shape when seen from far away			0
this made it harder for the @entity7 to work out how fast they were sailing and in which direction , reducing the accuracy of their guns			0
a total of 2,000 ships from the @entity60 and the @entity46 fleet were repainted in a dazzle design in 1917 and 1918 , with each one being unique so the @entity7 could not identify classes of ship by their markings			2
the camouflage fell out of favour by the 1940s , because it was rendered useless by the introduction of radar			0
dazzle camouflage was originally inspired by modernist artworks , making it a poignant choice for the national art project			1
now @entity17 , who has used similar visual techniques in his previous works , has designed a new unique pattern for the ship , which was revealed today			2
' one of the most respected @entity129 artists of his generation , @entity126 is a @entity7 sculptor whose work blurs the boundaries between design , sculpture , furniture - making and installation , ' said a 14 - 18 now spokesman			1
' these eye - catching vessels remind local people and visitors of the crucial role ships played in the country ’s wartime survival			0
' @entity1 ( 1918 ) was one of two ships given a dazzle makeover as part of the project , which aims to acknowlege the contribution made by artists during the war			2
the other vessel is the historic pilot ship , the @entity152 , which is docked in @entity153 , and has been decorated by @entity155 artist @entity154			2
' perceptions of the war have been shaped to a great extent by the artists of the time , including poets , writers , painters , sculptors , photographers and film - makers , many of whom served , and who reflected on the war and its effects , ' said the spokesman			0
' their work had a profound and lasting impact			0
' now , one hundred years later , we are inviting contemporary artists from the @entity45 and around the world to explore the resonance of the @entity3 today			0
