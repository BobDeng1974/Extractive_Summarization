the social worker instantly called the police , and after a few minutes he panicked and phoned mr @entity21 , shouting : ' i found a baby ! i called 911 , but i do n't think they believed me			2
' the couple waited together until the authorities came and took the child to safety , and mr @entity22 found minor fame when the local media reported that he had probably saved the baby 's life			1
in december that year , he was asked to appear in court to testify about how he found the boy , when and suddenly the judge asked , ' would you be interested in adopting this baby ?
