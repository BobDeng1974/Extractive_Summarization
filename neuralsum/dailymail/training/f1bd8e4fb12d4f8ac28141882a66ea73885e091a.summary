sir @entity1 's lawyers criticised a @entity3 committee for publishing a letter revealing details of the police investigation into sex abuse claims against the singer sir @entity1 's lawyers have criticised a @entity3 committee for publishing a letter about the police investigation into sex abuse allegations against the veteran singer			1
in a letter to mp @entity18 , chairman of the @entity19 , the star 's representatives said the disclosure was ' unnecessary ' and caused him ' a further round of unnecessary and extremely damaging media coverage with no due process '			1
earlier this week , a letter from @entity26 's chief constable emerged in which he said the police investigation into the singer has ' increased significantly in size ' and involves ' more than one allegation '			1
mr @entity18 has since defended the decision , saying it is ' policy ' to make all committee evidence public			1
the letter from @entity37 , of @entity38 , said : ' plainly , it was not necessary for the @entity41 letter to be published on any urgent basis , if at all			2
' the @entity41 letter appears to have been in the hands of the committee for a period of two weeks or more before it was proactively sent to media organisations , presumably to encourage widespread publicity			2
' there was ample time to properly consider whether the @entity41 letter ought to have been released before it actually was			0
' as a direct result of the decision of the committee to publish the @entity41 letter , and to proactively send it to media organisations , our client has been exposed to a further round of unnecessary and extremely damaging media coverage , with no due process			1
' mr @entity37 continued : ' our client had no opportunity to comment or make submissions to the committee in advance of publication , but had he been able to do so , the damage that has since been caused by the @entity19 's actions and by the @entity41 letter would , most likely , have been avoided			1
' the committee have , through their actions , facilitated coverage which would not have otherwise occurred			0
' stressing the fact that his client has not been arrested or charged with any offence and denies any wrongdoing whatsoever , mr @entity37 issued a strongly worded critique of this week 's developments			1
he also rebuked mr @entity18 for media appearances over the issue			1
mr @entity37 wrote : ' it does of course remain the case that our client has neither been arrested nor charged with any offence and that he denies any wrongdoing whatsoever			1
' in addition to not knowing much about the claims of new allegations , our client has not of course been interviewed about them			0
' extensive media interest was hardly dampened by the chairman of the committee who appeared on television to discuss the contents of the @entity109 on the same evening of its release			0
' it is manifestly unfair to our client that he has again been put in a situation where speculation and rumours are rife , where he can not defend himself because he is the subject of an investigation , and , where third parties appear to know more than he does			0
' it is not how a criminal investigation should be conducted			0
' mr @entity37 said it was understood that the letter from @entity124 was ' proactively ' sent to media organisations by the committee without notice being given to sir @entity1 or his lawyers			1
it also described the original letter from the police force as ' poorly worded ' and ' at certain points unnecessarily emotive ' , while including a ' number of significant points which could be misinterpreted '			0
sir @entity1 's lawyers said the police 's letter ' has the appearance of being written without the level of care and attention that such an important communication demands ' and disputed some of its contents			2
mr @entity37 said the singer has not been actively updated with ' substantive information ' relating to the investigation , claiming that ' in the main ' it is his solicitors , @entity152 , who have contacted @entity124 for updates			1
the letter added : ' that said , @entity41 and @entity152 have co-operated on several aspects of the investigation , for which our client has been grateful			2
' he remains very keen to co-operate fully and for the investigation to be resolved swiftly			0
' mr @entity37 said sir @entity1 has been kept ' fully briefed ' on conversations between his lawyers and @entity124			2
earlier this week , a letter from @entity26 's chief constable @entity163 ( pictured ) emerged in which he said the police investigation into the singer has ' increased significantly in size ' the letter addressed the police 's disclosure that there is ' more than one allegation ' , saying the ' information that has been provided to our client about the new allegations is so scarce it is difficult to comment meaningfully '			1
it went on : ' late on friday 6 february , @entity152 telephoned one of the lead officers on the investigation			0
during the course of that call , the officer told @entity152 that there was now more than one complaint ( albeit a small number )			0
very little substantive detail was disclosed			0
' it also questioned the claim that the investigation has ' increased significantly ' , saying : ' this phrasing is curious and seems to us to be - at best - a loose use of language and at worst to be unnecessarily emotive			2
' in the current climate , the phraseology deployed was likely to lead both readers and members of the press to jump to exaggerated conclusions , as indeed it has			0
' the letter called on mr @entity18 to take a number of actions in response to their concerns , concluding : ' in light of the damage that has been caused by the actions of @entity41 and the committee , we are taking the proactive step of making this letter publicly available straightaway , rather than waiting for it to appear on the committee 's website at some uncertain date in the future			1
' sir @entity1 said the claims against him were ' absurd and untrue ' and insisted he had ' never , in my life , assaulted anyone '			0
the entertainer was interviewed under caution last year by detectives investigating a claim of a sex crime involving a young boy in the 1980s , but was not arrested or charged .			0

earlier this week , a letter from @entity26 's chief constable revealed police investigation into the singer has ' increased significantly in size '
it also revealed that the investigation involves ' more than one allegation '
head of the committee mp @entity18 has since defended the decision , saying it is " policy " to make all committee evidence public
in a letter to mr @entity18 , the star 's lawyers said disclosure was ' unnecessary '
@entity37 , of @entity38 , issued a strongly worded critique
mr @entity37 also rebuked mr @entity18 for media appearances over the issue
added that his client has not been arrested or charged with any offence
