by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 2 october 2013 former @entity2 editor @entity1 claims that social networking websites may become a more reliable source of news than the @entity6 the @entity6 is led by a ‘ patrician elite ’ that fails to listen to its audiences , one of its former editors has claimed			1
@entity1 – who was @entity2 ’s economics editor for more than a decade - warned websites like @entity15 and @entity16 could soon become ‘ more believable ’ than @entity20 because they are more receptive to corrections from readers			1
and he blamed an outmoded management culture for preventing the corporation from changing with the times , saying senior executives are more worried about ‘ messing up ’ than producing interesting programmes			0
@entity1 left the @entity6 in august to become culture and digital editor at rival broadcaster @entity28			1
before leaving , he used an interview with the @entity30 to launch a series of broadsides against his former employer			0
the 53 - year - old journalist – who published a novel last year – said : ‘ editorial leadership at the @entity6 has become more modern since i joined 12 years ago			2
a more diverse set of people now get to be editorial leaders			0
but the organisation can still feel like it is set up to be led by a kind of patrician elite			0
‘ there can be a jarring sometimes between newer , younger editorial management and the way the organisation responds to commands and requests			0
’ he added : ‘ the danger sometimes is that the signals that come from the top are “ do n’t mess up , ” sometimes put a bit more forcefully , whereas the signals should be from the outside world , saying “ you ’re not ordinary enough , you ’re not believable enough , you ’re not innovating enough			0
” ‘ if i said one thing on leaving this building , it would be : “ become more receptive to those signals ”			0
’ during his time at the @entity6 , @entity1 was a vocal critic of the corporation ’s programme of cuts			1
despite insisting the corporation still has a ‘ global reputation for telling the truth and being impartial ’ , he warned it risked being overtaken by social networking sites			0
he said : ‘ to many people @entity15 is news ; @entity16 is a news service			2
our problem is when @entity15 and @entity16 become more believable than the @entity6 because they sound more authentic			1
or because they are better peer - reviewed in real time : ‘ that ’s wrong , change it ’			0
they are both subject to more peer - review than @entity6 output			2
’ he added : ‘ the problem we ’ve got as public service broadcasters , is to produce stuff that engages them as well as @entity6 content did with the 1950 ’s and 60 ’s generations … things that make them go “ wow , that is so true , and so like my life that i ’ve got to watch this every day ”			2
’ @entity1 is the second senior @entity6 journalist to leave in recent months			1
last week , economics editor @entity94 announced she was leaving to become chief market strategist for @entity98 ’s @entity97 unit on an estimated £ 400,000 salary			1
behind the times : mr @entity1 claims the @entity6 fails to listen to its viewers while websites like @entity15 and @entity16 are subject to more peer - review			1

@entity1 was @entity2 ’s economics editor for more than a decade
he *'s* warned websites like @entity16 could become ' more believable ' than the @entity6 because they are more receptive to corrections from readers
