unsafe devices are often made in @entity1 for as little as 3p on first examination the small white plug that arrived in bubble wrap in the post appeared perfectly innocuous			1
hundreds of thousands of devices much like it are currently plugged into sockets in offices , children ’s bedrooms , living rooms and kitchens around the country , powering up mobile phones — of which 30 million are sold in the @entity16 each year			1
but the bang that resounded , with a puff of black smoke , moments after new mother @entity18 plugged this device into her bedroom wall was anything but harmless			2
so powerful was the explosion , that the charger actually split in two and left a large , sooty circle around the socket			2
this was n’t a one - off , however : it would go on to happen a second time with an identical device			2
the thought of what could have been still makes care assistant @entity18 , who lives in @entity35 with partner @entity36 and their 19 - month - old daughter @entity37 , shudder			2
the incident , last november , has taken on a chilling significance since it emerged that a fire which claimed victims from three generations of one family last month , including a nine - week - old baby , was probably caused by a faulty charger			2
the blaze started in the living room and swept through the terrace home in @entity51 overnight on april 28 , killing brothers @entity52 , nine , and @entity54 , seven , their baby sister @entity54 , aunt @entity55 , 20 , and grandmother @entity56 , 53			2
such was the extent of the damage that it may be many weeks before fire investigators are able to confirm what caused the blaze , or even what type of charger was in use			2
but a spokesman for @entity67 said that ‘ the most probable cause ’ of the fatal fire was an ‘ electrical fault involving a faulty charging device ’			2
the tragedy highlights growing concerns about the dangers that may be hidden behind the casing of the ubiquitous charger in the wall			2
while the chargers which are supplied with branded electronic goods are made to the highest standard and are no cause for concern , it ’s cheap , unauthorised , ‘ unbranded ’ chargers — the type usually bought on the internet , from market stalls or abroad , rather than from reputable shops and suppliers — that can be hazardous			1
according to the charity @entity90 , many of the cheap devices it tests fail to meet the requirements of the @entity95 ( safety ) @entity97 1994			1
product safety manager @entity98 warns : ‘ it ’s driven by demand			1
people want multiple chargers to keep their lives going , one for home , one to take on holiday			1
when you can see one for £ 5 it seems worth taking the risk — at least that ’s how it seems at the time			0
’ unsafe devices are often made in @entity1 for as little as 3p			1
victims : @entity52 ( left ) and his brother @entity114 , seven ( right ) died in their home in @entity51 there have even been allegations that manufacturers may submit well - engineered products for testing , only to remove non-essential components to reduce costs — thereby increasing the risk of disastrous malfunctions			0
with an estimated 1.8 million mains mobile phone chargers bought online in the @entity16 each year , safety experts are concerned that thousands of lives are being put at risk			1
the evidence speaks for itself : last year , air stewardess @entity131 , 23 , was electrocuted at home in @entity1 when she answered her @entity134 while it was charging			1
in 2007 , seven - year - old @entity135 , from @entity136 , died playing with his @entity137 — he had been using a cheap , unbranded charger his family had bought on holiday in @entity141			1
he was electrocuted and found dead in his hotel room			0
tests revealed the charger had ‘ serious defects ’			0
his mother , @entity151 , said : ‘ until this happened to me , i would never have thought twice about buying a charger online			1
but you do n’t have to go to a foreign country to get a dodgy plug , you can get them here , or get them sent here			0
’ what to watch out for @entity157 indeed you can			0
while mains plugs for the @entity134 cost £ 15 from the @entity159 , add in a usb cable and you ’re looking at another £ 15			0
more generic usb mains chargers at @entity163 sell for £ 17.99 and @entity165 small - pin chargers are £ 14.99			1
but venture online and there are all manner of deals to be found			1
an iphone 5 mains adaptor can be picked up for as little as £ 3.69			0
for less than £ 5 you can also add an in - car charger			0
the same goes for devices which are compatible with @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity165 phones			1
it was this price discrepancy that drove @entity18 , 33 , to buy a cheap charger online last year			1
her branded @entity134 charger had broken and she wanted to buy a replacement			0
‘ @entity37 was only about three months old and i was on maternity leave , so we did n’t have a great deal of income , ’ she says			0
‘ the branded products were quite expensive , so i decided to look online and found a charger being sold for about £ 4			1
the seller had good ratings and seemed to be in the @entity16 , so i decided to buy it			1
’ ' people think it 's worth the risk to buy a £ 5 charger ' when the charger arrived , it looked entirely safe			0
@entity18 thought nothing of popping it into her bedroom wall , a few feet from her daughter ’s cot , attaching her phone , and walking into the bathroom , leaving partner @entity36 changing their baby ’s nappy			1
‘ i ’d only just got to the bathroom when i heard a huge bang and ran back into the bedroom , ’ says @entity18			0
‘ the charger had exploded and was practically fused to the wall			0
’ putting the experience down to bad luck , @entity18 contacted the seller , who apologised and dispatched a replacement charger			0
she was stunned when exactly the same thing happened			0
this time , it was in her living room wall and the plug itself blew apart			0
‘ i was naive buying something off the internet because it was cheap			1
i thought if it had happened once , it would n’t happen again			0
but the damage could have been so much worse			0
‘ as soon as i heard about the house fire in @entity51 i thought : “ that could have been us			0
” when i think that @entity37 ’s cot was near the socket i used , it makes me sick			0
’ the @entity235 found multiple reports from around the country of house fires being attributed to an issue with a mobile phone battery or charging device in the past month alone			1
only days ago , mother - of - two @entity242 , of @entity244 , in @entity245 , was woken by a flash and a ‘ bang ’ from her mobile			1
she had been charging it with a cheap plug purchased online while she lay sleeping in bed			1
with an estimated 1.8 ¿ million mains mobile phone chargers bought online in the @entity16 each year , safety experts are concerned that thousands of lives are being put at risk while the explosion tripped all the electrics in the house , fortunately it caused no damage			1
‘ i still charge my phone overnight now , but only with an official @entity266 charger and not near my head , ’ says @entity242 , 48			1
‘ i feel very lucky that this happened to me and not to my 12 - year - old daughter			1
’ fire chiefs confirm that the problem is growing			0
meanwhile , @entity273 rules governing reduction of electrical waste have seen many manufacturers now selling new phones with only a usb cable , which are used to charge via your computer , and no traditional wall plug			0
this , say experts , will only make people seek out cheap plug - in alternatives all the more			1
last year , it emerged that the @entity16 had seen a six-fold increase in the number of counterfeit electrical goods seized over the previous four years			1
and the value of such goods seized by councils and the @entity293 rose from just over £ 2.6 million in 2009 to more than £ 15.7 million in 2012			1
the most - seized items were chargers			1
some 67,000 potentially dangerous mobile chargers were uncovered in a single raid by @entity299 officers in @entity300 , @entity301 , last year			1
so what can go wrong to make a charger blow up ? unfortunately , most faults are not visible to the buyer , but instead involve the internal components			0
for example , the device may lack a suitable fuse to ensure that if something else on the phone fails , such as the battery , it safely contains any power surge or explosion			2
@entity98 says dodgy devices often lack this			2
this means that if the charger overheats , pressure will build , blowing the charger apart , creating a risk of fire and electric shock			0
cheaper products are often found to have pins that are too small or incorrectly placed			0
if they are the wrong size , they can damage the socket and lead to overheating			0
even without a naked flame , a charger can ignite under extreme heat , which is why fire safety experts stress that chargers should never be covered			1
by law , pins must be 9.5mm away from the edge of the charger body			0
if the distance is less — as it was with nine out of ten chargers in a recent sample test — there is a very real risk of electric shock from skin contact			2
as a consumer you might like to think that a ce mark — a declaration by the manufacturer that the product meets requirements of @entity273 law — means your product is safe			2
sadly , this can be all too easily faked			0
and many mobile phone users leave their devices charging overnight			1
is this safe ? while @entity266 insists its devices are designed so ‘ you can keep your device plugged in as long as you would like ’ , @entity98 still advises caution			2
‘ it does extend the risk unnecessarily			0
and the risk is exacerbated by using a cheap , unbranded charger			2
and when you are asleep you are less alert and less able to react			0
’ he says if you must leave your phone charging overnight , make sure you have a working smoke detector			2
similarly you should switch your power off at the wall if you leave your charger plugged in when not in use			0
simple tips — but as @entity18 knows only too well , they could be life - saving .			0
