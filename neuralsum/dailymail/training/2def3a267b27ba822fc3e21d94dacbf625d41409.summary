lord @entity6 , once the @entity4 's leader in the @entity5 , sent a letter last week to homeowners in @entity9 , @entity10 , claiming his ' market and fair rights , sporting rights and rights in respect of the mines and minerals beneath the property '			1
the letter added that it is ' the mineral rights which are of the most significance ' , a statement some residents fear may refer to fracking			1
campaigners have rallied together to form a @entity40 uprising on which some even suggested picketing the marquess ' ancestral home , @entity43 , wearing medieval costumes and ' waving pitchforks and burning torches '			1
' we are here to tell the good lord to frack off , ' @entity47 , a psychologist , who has received the landowner 's letter , wrote the page @entity53 against the @entity54			1
she added that she had lost a prospective buyer of her home after being forced to tell him the marquess now ' can hunt and shoot and dig up my back garden '			2
resident @entity60 suggested that they should ' find out whether @entity6 has manorial rights as well as responsibilities , e.g. giving alms to the poor , that kind of thing			2
' she told @entity69 : ' we 're campaigning because we think that lord of the manor rights have no place in this day and age			1
' the concept was invented in the time of @entity76 for a feudal society			0
it 's completely ridiculous that they should be in force now			0
' none of us who live here were told about these rights when we bought our properties , as they were n't at the time registered with the @entity89			1
' we feel very angry that this has come out of the blue			0
' we worry that this may cause problems when we try to sell our properties , but we 're also angry at the principle that is being invoked here - we do n't see why anyone else should have rights over land that we own			2
' the peer , who is descended from @entity103 's adviser @entity102 , lives in @entity43 , a @entity105 manor built buy the @entity106 in 1611			2

lavish : the peer , who is descended from @entity103 's adviser @entity102 , lives in @entity43 ( pictured ) , a @entity105 manor built buy the @entity106 in 1611			2
it contains paintings worth £ 125million his decision to register follows a law introduced by the @entity118 government in 2002 that stated all manorial rights would be lost if not registered with the @entity89 within an 11 - year window			2
now a number of landowners across the country are applying for manorial rights before that window closes this year			2
the @entity89 website states : ' although these are often described as " relics from past times " , owners of these rights or interests often have a duty or responsibility to protect them			0
' these are not new rights or interests being sought , the third party is normally simply looking to protect an interest they already hold			0
' but ms @entity60 added : ' some people are worried about fracking			0
there is concern that he may sell the rights to a private company - apparently in a similar case the @entity144 has said it might sell the rights it has			0
' of course it 's possible he does n't intend to do anything with them - but in that case , why bother registering them ? ' anger : campaigners in @entity9 ( pictured ) have rallied together to form a @entity40 uprising on which some even suggested picketing the marquess ' ancestral home , @entity43 , wearing medieval costumes and ' waving pitchforks and burning torches ' some residents complain that they have had little help from councillors or the local mp , @entity4 party chair @entity162			1
but today mr @entity162 pledged to fight for his constituents ' rights , vowing : ' over my dead body will he dig up someone 's back yard in my constituency			1
' he told the @entity69 : ' i think it is all very worrying and if i had received that letter , naturally i would be very concerned			1
indeed , my home is in the area and i would n't be surprised if i receive one too			0
but i will fight very hard for my constituents			0
' he said around 400 people in @entity9 has received the letter he had arranged a meeting with the marquess to determine exactly ' what he is planning to do '			1
but he added : ' these rights are so weak that they do n't even appear on property searches			0
i do n’t envisage the action the @entity184 have taken will impact my constituents ' rights			0
' lord @entity6 's lawyers , @entity188 , sought this afternoon to ease local residents ' worries in a statement			1
' as a result of the @entity196 , all historic manorial rights and ownerships had to be registered by october 2013 , ' it said			0
' the @entity20 has recorded his interests in the @entity198 ( and elsewhere ) and is keen to emphasise that this is a process that records pre-existing ownership			0
homeowners should not be alarmed by it			0
' the current marquess is a former @entity4 leader in the @entity5			1
on saturday , the local @entity206 is hosting its annual @entity208 market at the riding school in @entity43 , the @entity6 family seat .			1

the peer claimed his ' market rights , sporting rights and rights to minerals '
the letter told up to 400 residents that ' mineral rights ' were ' most significant '
local campaigners have *launched* a @entity40 uprising , vowing to fight claim
