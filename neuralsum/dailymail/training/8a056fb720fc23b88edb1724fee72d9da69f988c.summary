@entity0 will unlock the doors to the @entity2 this week boosted by the news that @entity4 is in contention to make his comeback in the @entity8 curtain - raiser against @entity9			1
@entity10 understands the @entity12 winger resumed full training on monday and hopes to feature on sunday for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in last month ’s @entity17 defeat by @entity18			1
@entity0 winger @entity4 resumed full training on monday it has been a frustrating six months for the 23 - year - old , who was ruled out of the club ’s last ever game at @entity24 and also missed both the autumn series and summer tour of @entity27			1
but he hopes to return for sunday ’s landmark fixture , which could bring logistical teething problems for the newly @entity31 - based side , who will stay in a @entity8 hotel on saturday night			1
‘ i do n’t think there will be a lot of disruption , ’ said captain @entity34			2
‘ being in a hotel on site will get a lot of the boys out of their comfort zone , which i do n’t think is a bad thing			2
‘ you can get spoiled with a bit of luxury			0
i learned not to be precious and spoiled pretty early on and that teaches you to get on with it and focus on what makes you tick			0
@entity4 suffered an ankle injury in last month ’s @entity17 defeat by @entity18 ‘ we ’re going to “ @entity53 ” the changing room			1
we have been very respectful to @entity8 , but we ’ll put banners up and make it very @entity0			1
we ’re not changing the seating or anything like that so i hope the off - field team at @entity0 have flags and things prepared for the crowd to lay a marker down			1
’ attendance figures are expected to reach a season ’s high in sunday ’s fixture , with ticket sales already surpassing the previous record of 22,700			1
the club are laying on transport for supporters from @entity75 , where they struggled to attract decent - sized crowds in recent years			1
@entity34 is the club ’s longest - serving player , having made his senior debut back in 2002			2
he has been involved with the @entity80 side for most of their 12 - year association with @entity24 , but is not fazed by the relocation			2
@entity0 captain @entity34 is looking forward to playing at @entity2 ‘ if you asked any other member of the squad they will probably tell you it will be weird , ’ said @entity34			0
‘ for me , it does n’t matter			0
the most important thing is the performance and making sure we are there emotionally			0
that ’s going to be the biggest test			0
‘ if i ’m being frank , for 99 per cent of the guys sunday was another day at the office			0
they do n’t all share that emotion with @entity24 and this team is completely different from when i came in			0
the only things the same are the name , the kit man and me			0
’ meanwhile , @entity18 flanker @entity104 will make his comeback in an @entity107 game next week having missed the season so far with a neck injury .			0
