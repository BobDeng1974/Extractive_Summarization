a woman who had three liver transplants and was given just hours to live has celebrated her good health by getting married			2
@entity3 , 22 , from @entity4 , never thought she would find love due to her health problems , which saw her go undergo three gruelling operations in just three years after her body repeatedly rejected her new livers			1
but , after years of hospital appointments and surgeries , the blogger met her future husband , @entity13 , 25 , on a rare day away from hospital - and the pair married last month			1
in march last year @entity13 proposed to @entity3 and they were married last month @entity3 , pictured in hospital before her second liver transplant , never thought she would find love @entity3 said : ' with all my health issues , i come with a lot of baggage , so i never thought i 'd find love			1
' the first time i met @entity13 my skin was still yellow and i had a big tube in my nose , but he saw through it and treated me like a normal person			1
' it was so refreshing because everyone was used to constantly tiptoe - ing around me and wrapping me in cotton wool because i 'd been unwell for so long			0
' i 'd lost a lot of my younger years on hospital wards so i was shocked he was interested in me , normally as soon as people heard i was a transplant patient they were too scared			0
@entity3 was given had two unsuccessful liver transplants before the third and final one was a success			1
pictured - the 22 - year - old 's stomach showing the scars from transplants one and two @entity3 , 22 , spent three years battling life - threatening liver failure , but has now celebrated returning to good health by marrying her husband @entity13 @entity3 , pictured in hospital , was told that she would be lucky to survive a week if doctors failed to find a donor ' i had to warn him that i would be ill a lot of the time and might have a shorter life expectancy because of being a transplant patient			1
' it was n't the most romantic way to get to know someone but we had to be honest with each other			0
' after experiencing health issues for much of her life , @entity3 wondered if she would ever find love			1
she said : ' i used to get really upset , talking to my mum about how i 'd never have a relationship with anyone			0
' i wondered if anyone would ever want to deal with the hassle , but it did n't faze @entity13 at all			2
@entity3 , pictured left before transplant number three and before her date with @entity13 , and , right , after the operation , says @entity13 met her when she still had tubes in her nose and was not phased at all ' in the beginning of our relationship , whenever i used to talk about my health problems , he 'd change the subject			1
' it was strange to get used to , but refreshing , he wanted to know me but in a different way to everybody else - he did n't care about my health issues			0
' @entity3 began experiencing symptoms of liver failure when she was just 16 years old			1
her worried parents , @entity88 and @entity89 , put her lack of energy down to her being a teenager , but soon her exhaustion began to take over her life			0
she said : ' at school i would find that i could n't concentrate and would bring a lot of my work home , i just lacked energy to think clearly			0
' it got to the point where i planned days out with friends , was looking forward to them , but had to cancel because i could n't pull myself out of bed			0
' @entity3 says it was amazing to find someone who did n't tiptoe around her illness but it was n't until @entity3 passed out at a supermarket that her parents realised something was n't right			1
@entity3 said : ' i came round and could n't stand up on my own , my @entity111 had to support me even when taking a few steps			2
@entity3 is now back to normal health but says that she has to take things a bit slower ' i went to the doctor 's surgery and the nurse took two looks and pulled a very worried face			2
' a gp rushed in and noticed how jaundiced i looked - he called an ambulance straight away			0
' @entity3 spent three weeks at @entity124 , while doctors tried to determine the cause of her symptoms			1
she was transferred to the @entity128 where she was diagnosed with end stage liver failure caused by auto immune hepatitis - a condition that is caused by an unknown virus that causes the body to attack itself , thinking your organs are foreign objects			1
@entity3 said : ' i was diagnosed two days before my 18th birthday			2
' my family and i were told the news , and then the doctors then introduced us to two transplant coordinators - they told me i 'd be lucky to survive until the end of the week without a liver transplant			2
' after i heard that everything turned to white noise			0
' i could n't concentrate or take in anything the doctors said			0
' in my hospital bed , it did n't feel like my last week to live			0
i had to remain positive			0
' it felt so dreadful and feared what would happen if they could n't get me a liver in time			0
' but i kept thinking that if i died i did n't want my family to remember me in pain and a misery , i wanted to leave them with happy memories			0
' @entity3 's case was urgent and she was bumped to the top of the transplant list			1
@entity164 ticked away and with less than 48 hours to live , doctors raced to tell @entity3 that they 'd found a liver , which was being flown over from @entity166			1
little did they know , the plane carrying @entity3 's new liver had crashed on the runway at @entity170 , after heavy fog and bad weather conditions made it difficult for the pilot to land			1
surgeons worried the organ may have been damaged in the crash that hospitalised two people , but fortunately it was found by the fire services who plucked it from the burning plane and rushed it to the hospital			0
the transplant was complete , but eight days later the family 's joy was dashed , when @entity3 's body rejected the new liver			1
@entity3 was put back on the transplant list , and was placed in a medically induced coma to prolong her life			1
remarkably , a second liver was soon found and a second transplant took place			2
but six months later @entity198 's skin returned to a jaundiced glow , a clear sign that her body was rejecting this liver too			0
@entity3 said : ' a lot of people die waiting on the transplant list so i felt so lucky to have had the two livers but equally shocked they had failed			1
' the first two kept me alive long enough to try again and gave me that chance to fight my rare condition , it spurred me on to keep fighting			0
' @entity3 met @entity13 just three weeks after her final transplant and the pair instantly clicked @entity3 's health continued to get worse - she suffered from fluid retention around her heart and lungs as well as severe kidney failure , almost heading into a coma			1
three months later , @entity3 was overjoyed once more to discover that a third liver was found			1
remarkably , her body accepted the liver and her health started to pick up			0
three weeks later @entity3 was discharged from hospital for the weekend where she met @entity13 , an airman in the @entity225 , at a party			1
quickly the couple grew close and in march last year , @entity13 popped the question			2
@entity3 said : ' he came home one day and asked me to marry him			2
' it was n't a big fancy engagement , but it was perfect for us			0
' the couple finally married in july last year and are now planning their honeymoon			0
@entity3 said : ' i should have died at 18 before i had my first transplant , so to find love and to have married @entity13 has made me happier than i could have imagined			1
' i never thought anyone would be able to overlook everything i 've been through			0
' my health is now fine , although i still have to take things a bit slower than other people , a day 's shopping will tire me out , which @entity13 's probably grateful for			2
