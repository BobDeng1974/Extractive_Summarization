@entity0 might create machines that show their intentions , but a math model says emotional machines like @entity6 the android from @entity7 's @entity8 wo n't exist the prospect of robot overlords , friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years			1
but according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness , emotional machines will never exist			2
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , one expert claims			1
a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity28 at the @entity29 , says that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness			1
he believes that integrated information ca n't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds , because the brain contextualises information			1
for example , when we see a red triangle our brains do n't register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area , @entity38 reported			0
instead we see it as a whole - a red triangle , we understand the ' wider picture '			0
@entity48 of the @entity49 in @entity50 , said that a computational device called the @entity53 logic gate relies on predicting outcomes using a combination of two inputs , which require a loss of information			0
‘ you have to put in two bits and you get one out			0
if the brain integrated information in this fashion , it would have to be continuously haemorrhaging information			0
’ his team has defined integration in terms of how tricky it is to modify information			0
it is easy enough for machines to edit a collection of individual images , but memories are composed of a bank of intertwined images and experiences and can not be altered in the same way			0
unrequited love : consciousness can not be created in physical machines in finite time using limited memory as this is beyond scientists ' abilities			1
the study suggests that humans will not find friendship with a robot ( pictured left and right ) but are unlikely to be made their slaves either a mathematical framework for consciousness developed over the last decade by @entity28 at the @entity29 says that the ability to integrate information is a main feature of consciousness			1
he believes that integrated information can not be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds , because the brain contextualises information			0
for example , when we see a red triangle our brains so not register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area			0
consciousness can not be created in a physical machines in finite time using limited memory , according to another expert who thinks robots will never be able to feel emotions like humans			1
the researchers have used mathematics to show that computers can not handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly			2
therefore , if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information , computers ca n’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans			1
professor @entity48 says that consciousness can not be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory			1
‘ it does n't necessarily mean that there is some magic going on in the brain that involves some forces that ca n't be explained physically			2
it is just so complex that it 's beyond our abilities to reverse it and decompose it , ’ he said			2
his research may mean that lonely humans will not find love with a robot , they are unlikely to be made their slaves either .			0
