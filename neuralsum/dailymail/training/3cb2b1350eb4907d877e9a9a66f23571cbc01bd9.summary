by @entity1 reporter published : 10:23 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 10:36 est , 23 january 2014 first it was @entity5 's fingerprint sensor that got tech fans all flustered and then there was the more recent rumour that @entity10 's next phone could come complete with iris - scanning technology			1
but now , thanks to an app , you do n't need to but a new phone to get a futuristic unlocking feature			2
new @entity18 software now allows you to unlock your phone using your ear			2
the @entity18 app claims that a person 's earprint is as unique as their fingerprint and that it is more convenient to use			1
biometrics is an increasingly popular area of development in mobile technology @entity32 based company @entity28 claims their ' biometric authentication application ' is a ' robust and reliable mobile device security solution '			1
use passwords of eight characters or more with mixed types of characters use passphrases -- short words with spaces or other characters separating them it 's best to use random words rather than common phrases			0
for example , " cakes years birthday " or " smiles_light_skip ? " avoid using the same username / password combination for multiple websites			0
the company also claims that a person 's ear print is as unique as their fingerprint			1
as with a fingerprint sensor , the patent - pending app verifies an phone owner 's identity against a profile stored on the device before granting access it			1
an owner 's identity is then checked against ear measurements as well as the manner - such as the angle - in which the phone is placed against the face			1
biometric technology is gaining popularity in the mobile phone industry , with various companies experimenting with innovative ways to make technology more responsive and tailored its user			1
earlier this month @entity10 ’s executive vice president @entity77 announced that the firm was looking to release its next flagship phone between march and april			2
the app , costing £ 2.50 ( $ 3.99 ) , also monitors the way a phone owner moves the phone to their face - checking the angle at which it rests on the users face , for example @entity10 is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its @entity92 range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on @entity5 's @entity96 , pictured @entity77 also discussed the possibility of a future model that could feature iris - recognition technology , but he did not confirm if it would be added to @entity100 or not			1
biometric experts at @entity103 - based firm @entity102 have already created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner that , they claim , could replace all passwords for you electrical devices			2
the @entity111 device can register up to five different users			0
each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises			2
these unique images are then translated into an encrypted code			0
the scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately			0
different body parts are more reliable than others when it comes to identification			0
voice recognition , for example , is far less secure than facial recognition , while iris scanning technology is even more surperior once registered , each user can add various online passwords to their @entity111 profile			1
next time the user visits one of these accounts , instead of entering a password , they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access			0
according to @entity102 , the @entity139 of the average fingerprint sensor , in which the system is hacked by an unknown print , is one in every 10,000 scans			0
for iris scans , this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans			0
@entity147 is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around £ 150 ( $ 250 ) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced .			0

$ 3.99 @entity153 software uses a person 's earprint to identify its owner
it also measures the angle at which the phone is put against a user 's head
biometrics are an increasingly popular area of in mobile technology - with @entity10 's latest phone rumoured to have iris - scanning technology
