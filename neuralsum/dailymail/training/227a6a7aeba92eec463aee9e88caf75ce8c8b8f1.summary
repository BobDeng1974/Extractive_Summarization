it was not just @entity1 who would have loved this performance from @entity4 ; @entity5 and @entity6 would have heartily approved too			1
gloriously irascible , the 27 year - old @entity7 mentally and technically outmuscled @entity8 in what became something of a grudge match to reach his fourth @entity13 final at the @entity14 on thursday			1
after a shaky start @entity4 played superbly – as well as he has done since winning @entity16 – to advance 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) , 6 - 0 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 in three hours and 26 minutes			1
it had been boiling up before then , and even the normally demure @entity25 became unusually animated , caught uttering the odd oath in the supporters ' box			0
@entity4 admitted afterwards that there was an unusual edge to it all , given that he was in opposition to his ex-coach @entity47 for the first time			1
he drew on that , as was obvious when he broke back in the first set and directed his celebration towards his opponent 's box			2
it might have been habit , but probably not			0
' there was a little bit of extra tension , it was a big match , ' said @entity4			1
' a lot was made of @entity47 working with him			1
we have been friends since we were 15 years old			0
i thought it was a bit unfair to create a bit of extra tension out of it but it was there			1
everyone calmed down after a bit			0
' @entity4 looked in supreme form again - as he has done for the past fortnight over in @entity19 @entity47 , @entity4 's former coach , watches on from @entity8 's box and @entity4 admitted that added ' extra tension ' @entity4 gestures after losing the opening set on a tiebreak after fighting back from 5 - 3 down the sun peaks through on a mild @entity77 evening in @entity19 as thousands watch inside the @entity14 @entity8 later explained what he said when the two passed at the changeover that seemed to annoy @entity4			1
' i really remember it well			0
i say to myself " well done @entity84 "			0
i think i ’m allowed to do that when i win a set			2
what , i have to be worried about every word i am going to say ? i just pumped myself up for winning the first set then sat on the chair			2
maybe next time i should stay even more calm , and that ’s it			0
it was a great battle a good match , unfortunately with a bad end for me			0
' @entity4 , the 27 year - old @entity7 , also wanted to prove a point about his hiring of @entity100 , saying : ' a lot of people criticised me working with her and i think so far this week we 've shown that women can be very good coaches as well			1
' @entity106 who reached the semis here and had her best tournament is also coached by a woman in @entity112 and i see no reason why that ca n't keep moving forward like that in the future			0
' i 'm very thankful for @entity100 for doing it			0
it was a brave choice from her to do it and hopefully i can repay her in a few days			0
' @entity4 fought back in the second set - beating @entity8 to love in a stunning half hour of tennis @entity4 had plenty of @entity123 supporters in the crowd as he looked to progress to the final @entity8 celebrates winning the first set after holding his nerve in the tiebreak the no 6 seed added : ' i was obviously disappointed to lose the first set			1
i had a couple of chances at the end and break points at 5 - 5			1
i felt like i started to play better as the set went on and tried to stick to my game and was then very aggressive at the start of the second set			2
' i changed tactics a little bit but also i was getting more comfortable with the conditions and the heavy ball that @entity84 hits			0
in the second set i made him do most of the running			2
i started dictating the points , getting the first strike in			0
after losing a tough set like the first it as important to get the momentum back			2
' the reward is a fiendishly tough final , against either the world no 1 @entity31 or defending champion @entity32 , who face off on friday			1
@entity4 will have an extra day to recover , although historically that has never been a huge advantage here			1
@entity4 had to hurdle some advertising hoardings during an intense third set - which he eventually won @entity4 's fiancee @entity156 watches on nervously at @entity14 as the semi-final unfolds on thursday @entity159 was also there to cheer on her fiancee @entity8 - but he ultimately went down to @entity162 @entity164 @entity163 and former player @entity165 watched on from the stands as @entity4 progressed comfortably on whether he would be watching their semi-final , @entity4 said : ' i will definitely watch a little bit but judging by their matches in the last couple of years here i might be in bed before they 're finished			1
so far both have been playing fantastic tennis so whoever has got tickets for that is very lucky			0
' less contentiously than the spats , there were also several technical aspects that underpinned one of the more memorable victories of @entity4 's career			2
the @entity7 's first serve was excellent , particularly the slider he has perfected out to the deuce court			0
his movement was superb , and he frequently outmaneuvered the 6ft 5in @entity191 around the baseline			0
a tendency of @entity8 has been to serve in a predictable fashion , and when he tried to push @entity162 wide with the serve the @entity123 no 1 was more agile to respond , and he began to read it perfectly from the second set onwards			2
@entity8 , the perennial nearly man , could not adjust his thinking as much as the master tactician @entity4 , who is now in his eighth grand slam final			1
the @entity191 did n't get a sniff after winning the tiebreak , with @entity4 far too strong for him @entity4 pulled @entity8 apart after losing the first set and goes into his fourth @entity13 final @entity16 2013 - beat @entity31 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 @entity13 2013 - lost to @entity31 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 3 - 6 , 2 - 6 @entity205 2012 - beat @entity31 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 2 @entity16 2012 - lost to @entity206 6 - 4 , 5 - 7 , 3 - 6 , 4 - 6 @entity13 2011 - lost to @entity31 4 - 6 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6 @entity13 2010 - lost to @entity206 3 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 7 @entity205 2008 - lost to @entity206 2 - 6 , 5 - 7 , 2 - 6			1

@entity4 beat @entity8 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) , 6 - 0 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 to reach the @entity13 final
the @entity210 will face either @entity31 or @entity32 in the final on sunday
@entity4 had lost the opening set in a tiebreak but fought back superbly
no 6 seed admitted there was ' extra tension ' *due* to his former coach @entity47 working with @entity8
