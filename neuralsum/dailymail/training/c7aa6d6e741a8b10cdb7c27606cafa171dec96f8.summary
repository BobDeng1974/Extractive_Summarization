by @entity0 published : 00:57 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 07:29 est , 17 august 2012 @entity1 , the @entity2 vice-presidential candidate , has admitted that he sought millions of dollars in federal government economic stimulus cash after twice denying he had done so			1
the embarrassing reversal was the first major campaign trail mistake made by the @entity8 congressman and came as a new poll showed that he had put his home state into play for @entity12 , who is now leading president @entity13 there			0
@entity1 said that he had forgotten that his office had sent letters , which were signed by him , to the @entity18 and @entity19 departments asking for money from the stimulus programme on behalf of two @entity8 companies			2
' they should have been handled differently , and i take responsibility for that , ' @entity1 said in a written statement released after an @entity29 interview on thursday in which he had once again denied requesting stimulus funds			1
backtracking : @entity1 went back on his statement that he did not ask the federal government for stimulus cash , after a letter revealed that he did indeed ask for grant money in 2009 the denial in an interview with @entity39 's @entity38 contradicted letters he wrote in 2009 to @entity41 , energy secretary , and @entity43 , @entity44			1
federal records show that one of the two companies , the non-profit @entity48 , later raked in $ 20.3million from the @entity49 to help homes and businesses improve energy efficiency			0
according to the @entity53 , @entity1 also told @entity55 's @entity54 two years ago that he ' did not ask for stimulus money ' in response to a question about the recovery program			2
request : @entity1 said in letters to energy secretary @entity41 that stimulus cash would help his state create thousands of new jobs new audio has surfaced of @entity1 telling the station that he ' did not ask for stimulus money ' in response to a caller 's question about the recovery program			1
@entity1 said : ' i 'm not one who votes for something and then writes to the government to ask them to send us money			0
' the exchange was first reported thursday by the @entity53			0
but a year earlier in his request to @entity41 for funds for the @entity82 , @entity1 said the stimulus cash would help his state create thousands of new jobs , save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions			1
the apparent contradiction underscores @entity1 's conflicts with his larger federal budget proposal as the @entity91 chairman			0
that plan would slash @entity49 programs aimed at creating green jobs and calls for ' getting @entity96 out of the business of picking winners and losers in the economy - and that includes our energy sector			0
' @entity1 's actions in @entity105 have been drawing fresh scrutiny since he was named last weekend as @entity2 presidential candidate @entity12 's running mate			2
the vice presidential contender is not alone among @entity2 who criticized the stimulus plan only to seek money later			1
@entity113 's @entity2 senators , @entity114 and @entity115 , for example , blasted the bill as a bloated government giveaway yet asked then - defense secretary @entity118 to steer $ 50million in stimulus money to a constituent 's bio-energy project			1
like - minded : @entity12 , pictured thursday in @entity122 , @entity123 , and @entity1 both believe that the stimulus did not create private sector jobs @entity1 's views are also consistent with @entity12 's long - held position that the stimulus was a flawed idea that did not create private sector jobs			1
' that stimulus did n't work , ' @entity12 said at an @entity131 speech in june			0
' that stimulus did n't put more private - sector people to work			0
' yet in @entity1 's letter to the @entity135 in october 2009 , he backed the @entity136 of @entity8 's grant application for stimulus money ' to develop an industry - driven training and placement agenda that intends to place 1,000 workers in green jobs			2
' economy questions : @entity1 and @entity12 both agree that president @entity13 's stimulus plan ' did nothing to stimulate the economy ' the company did not win the @entity135 grant , federal records show			1
despite the letter , @entity1 echoed @entity12 's position on thursday			0
' regardless , it 's clear that the @entity13 stimulus did nothing to stimulate the economy , and now the president is asking to do it all over again , ' he said .			0

@entity1 says his office asked the federal government for stimulus grant money after twice saying he did not ask for the funds
@entity1 was n't alone , as @entity2 *lawmakers* @entity114 and @entity115 also asked for stimulus funds after *rejecting* the plan
@entity1 and @entity12 both believe that the stimulus plan did little to create jobs in the private sector
