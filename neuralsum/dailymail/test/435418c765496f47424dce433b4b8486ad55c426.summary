sweeping is a tedious task but now a new ‘ smart bin ’ could help save you from all that bending down with a dust pan			1
the @entity5 is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner			1
using sensors on the front of the bin , it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush , turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess			1
the @entity5 ( pictured ) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum			1
it also has an integrated bag store and charging cord @entity5 comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags , and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish			1
developed by inventors @entity37 and @entity38 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , the bin is able to clean up dog hair and spilt breakfast cereal and crumbs , sucking it up directly into the bin bag			0
it is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain , glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs			0
scientists have developed a ‘ self - cleaning ’ coating that can be sprayed onto materials			0
the substance , made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles , works because it is very , very water resistant			0
any moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away , cleaning up dust in its path			0
the breakthrough , by chemists at @entity67 , comes after years of research into highly water - resistant - or ‘ superhydrophobic ’ - substances			0
it also features a motion sensitive hands - free lid that opens automatically			1
the inventors said : ‘ @entity5 and its patents pending technologies have been many months in the making			2
‘ the powerful vortex vacuum feature will deliver every dog hair , cheerio and grain of dirt directly into the trash bag			2
‘ no more stopping , no more scooping , just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and @entity5 will do the rest			1
‘ @entity5 will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day , and alert you when you are low on @entity91			1
’ the pair is hoping to attract support for their invention on @entity96			0
they said the @entity100 can run for 30 days on its battery before needing to be recharged			0
@entity101 swept close to the base of the @entity5 activates the vacuum , which sucks it directly into the bin			1
the vacuum is powerful enough so suck up spilt breakfast cereal , dust and hair , while its integrated bag dispenser knows when you need to buy new bags an extendable recharging cord is built into a flip up section just behind the main lid			2
users can buy custom - fitted bags for the @entity5 , which fit into its dispenser , or use standard bin bags			2
the bin has a capacity of 59 litres ( 13 gallons )			0
it is expected to cost $ 248 ( £ 160 ) , although early buyers can pre-order it for $ 139 ( £ 90 )			0
the @entity5 bin comes in five colours including white ( above ) and will last for 30 days on a single charge			2

@entity5 is world *'s* first internet connected vacuum and rubbish bin
it uses sensors to detect when dust is brushed close to it and sucks it up
motion sensors open the lid automatically and can send alerts to your phone to remind you when the trash needs to be taken out
