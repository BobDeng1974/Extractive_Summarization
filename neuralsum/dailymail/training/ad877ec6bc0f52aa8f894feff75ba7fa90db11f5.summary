the @entity18 was also investigating any link between the exercise and the fire			0
the revelation drew anger from @entity64 , mayor of the community of @entity36 , which has been ravaged by several of the fires over the past week			1

' i want to ensure that this does n't detract from the efforts that @entity18 have made over the past week in assisting the state 's emergency services battle these fires , ' he told the @entity97			1
the development came as residents in the @entity36 drove down ahead of a wall of flames today , with precious family heirlooms stuffed into bags			2

' a total of 95 firefighting aircraft were deployed , but winds up to 50mph forced the water - bombing helicopters to suspend operations over fires at @entity16 and the @entity36 during the day , @entity173 spokesman @entity172 said			1
all hands on deck : fire crews from @entity182 , @entity54 and @entity11 are seen waiting to be tasked for fires burning in the @entity36 welcome rest : firefighters take a break before their next assignment			1

one death has been blamed on the fires			0
the early start to the fires this year ' is indicative of the unseasonably hot , dry conditions that have been building now throughout winter into spring , and we need to remind ourselves that we still have a long way to go as we look down the coming months into summer ' , mr @entity167 said			0
@entity81 resident @entity202 said the atmosphere was tense in the village that was one of the worst - hit last week			0

hazard on the horizon : @entity221 watches the fire from the top of his roof in @entity35 as residents were advised to leave for evacuation centres in @entity5 fighting many fronts : @entity13 firefighters try to extinguish a small fire approaching homes near the @entity36 suburb of @entity49 inferno : @entity13 commissioner @entity142 said 71 fires are burning in @entity11 state around @entity5 , including 29 which are out of control marauding : a @entity237 satellite image from monday showing the spread of the @entity2 wildfires west and north - west of @entity5 fire officials said they were gratified that to date no - one had lost their life to the flames , although the toll on wildlife was , in the words of one animal rescue group , ' unimaginable '			1
mr @entity247 , a wildlife rescue co-ordinator in the @entity36 , said burned animals that had managed to emerge from their destroyed habitat included wallabies , possums , lizards , echidnas and birds			2
' many are distressed , they 've been burned and they 've been badly affected by smoke , ' he said as volunteers treated the animals			0

but at a showground near the town of @entity270 at the foot of the @entity36 hundreds of pets were in safe hands after being brought down from the mountains			2

as the loss of houses ran towards the 300 mark , weary firefighters were sickened to hear that two boys aged 14 and 11 had been held by police for deliberately starting fires in the @entity141 area north of @entity5			2
and two other boys were arrested for allegedly stealing from a cafe a charity collection box containing donations for those who had lost all their possessions			0
