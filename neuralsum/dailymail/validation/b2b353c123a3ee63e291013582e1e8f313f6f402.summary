listeriosis , a food - borne illness , linked to some @entity3 ice cream products did not cause the deaths of three hospital patients , but it may have been a contributing factor , according to @entity7 health officials			1
however , the only information provided about the patients at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity7 , is that they were adults , said @entity12 , a spokeswoman for the @entity7 @entity13			2
the @entity14 said five people , three women and two men , developed listeriosis in @entity7 after eating products from one production line at the @entity3 creamery in @entity20 , @entity21			1
officials have not released their names , and the @entity24 did not specify the gender of those patients who died			0
the deaths prompted the @entity21 icon 's first product recall in its 108 - year history			2
the deaths prompted the @entity21 icon 's first product recall in its 108 - year history listeria bacteria were found in samples of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , scoops , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , said the @entity14 ( above the @entity3 products that had listeria bacteria found in them ) listeria bacteria were found in samples of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , scoops , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , said the @entity14			1

it also said it has recovered all recalled products that were in stores and in storage			0
the five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between december 2013 and january 2015 , said hospital spokeswoman @entity64			2
according to a statement on friday from the @entity24 , all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same @entity7 hospital before developing listeriosis , ' a finding that strongly suggests their infections ( with listeria bacteria ) were acquired in the hospital , ' the @entity24 said			1
however , uncertainty remains as to where the patients acquired bacterial infection			0
@entity3 said its regular @entity47 were untainted , as were its half gallons , quarts , pints , cups , three - gallon ice cream and take - home frozen snack novelties ( above the @entity44 that have been recalled ) there appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection ( above the @entity43 which have had traces of listeria bacteria found in them ) ' @entity93 was not aware of any listeria contamination in the @entity3 ice cream products and immediately removed all @entity3 products from all @entity98 locations once the potential contamination was discovered , ' @entity64 said in a statement friday to @entity101			1
information has been available from four of the five patients on what foods they had eaten in the month before the infection			0
all four had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving @entity3 ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the @entity24 said			1
' scoops , ' as well as the other suspect @entity3 items , are mostly food service items and not produced for retail , said @entity115 , ceo of the @entity20 creamery			1
the @entity24 said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at the hospital matched strains isolated from @entity3 products obtained this year in @entity123 and @entity21			1
four patients in hospital had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving @entity3 ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the @entity24 said ( above the @entity129 that has also been recalled ) the five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between december 2013 and january 2015 , said hospital spokeswoman @entity64 ( listeria bacteria were also found in @entity37 , above ) @entity3 handles all of its own distribution and customer service , @entity115 said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional , as soon as it was alerted to the @entity123 contamination february 13			1
@entity115 did not suspect handling of those products after they left the @entity21 creamery			1
' the only time it can be contaminated is at the time of production , ' he said			0
that contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies , and that machine remains off line , he said			1
all products now on store and institution shelves are safe and wholesome , @entity115 said			0
however , ' contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers , institutions , and retailers , given that these products can have a shelf life of up to two years , ' the @entity24 statement said			1
@entity3 handles all of its own distribution and customer service , @entity115 said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional , as soon as it was alerted to the @entity123 contamination february 13			1
@entity115 did not suspect handling of those products after they left the @entity21 creamery ( above pictures from the @entity3 factory in @entity20 , @entity21 ) @entity24 recommends that consumers do not eat products that @entity3 removed from the market , and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them ( above @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity7 ) @entity184 - based supermarket chain @entity183 removed recalled @entity3 products from 860 of its 2,625 stores and the company is alerting customers through its recall notification system , spokesman @entity182 said in an email			1
' we would not sell any product that we believed to be potentially harmful to our customers , ' said @entity182 when asked if @entity183 has confidence in @entity3 products not affected by the recall and that remain on store shelves			2
@entity197 is a food - borne illness that is especially dangerous to pregnant women , newborns , the elderly , those with compromised immune systems , and other serious conditions ( like diabetes , kidney failure , liver disease , and @entity205 )			0
it rarely causes serious illness in healthy people and can be treated with antibiotics			0
symptoms include fever , muscle aches , nausea and diarrhea			0
because it can be so serious for some people , outbreaks of listeria generally cause more deaths than other pathogens such as salmonella or @entity222			2
an outbreak of listeria linked to @entity226 cantaloupe in 2011 caused 33 deaths			0
those at high - risk are advised to avoid eating hot dogs , cold cuts and other deli meats			0
they should also avoid fermented or dry sausages unless they are cooked properly			0
refrigerated meat spreads and pâtés could also contain the bacteria			0
scientists recommend people with a weak immune system should also avoid soft cheese unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk			0
@entity24 recommends that consumers do not eat products that @entity3 removed from the market , and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them			2
the @entity248 said facilities like @entity3 's are inspected on a monthly basis			0
the agency added that no enforcement action has previously been taken against the facility in @entity20 and it is operating in compliance with food safety laws			0
it is not unusual to see listeria outbreaks linked to dairy products , including ice cream , said @entity260 , an attorney who represented victims of a 2011 listeria outbreak that killed 33 people and was traced to a @entity226 cantaloupe farm			1
in december , an ice cream company in @entity266 , @entity267 , recalled nearly a year 's worth of ice cream and related products because of possible listeria contamination that sickened two men			1
@entity260 said he thought @entity3 had responded appropriately once it knew its products were linked to illnesses and deaths			2
his only criticism was that @entity3 did not mention the patients who were sickened or died in @entity7 in a statement on its online site , and instead mentioned it was the first re-call in 108 year - history			1
listeriosis is a life - threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called listeria monocytogenes , the @entity24 said			2
almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection , meaning the bacteria spread from their intestines to the blood , causing bloodstream infection , or to the central nervous system , causing meningitis			0
although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to two months after eating contaminated food , symptoms usually start within several days			2
listeriosis is treated with antibiotics , the @entity24 said .			0

@entity7 health officials said listeriosis was not cause but a contributing factor in the three deaths of patients at @entity305 hospital
