@entity1 family has owned farm since 1882 and always had working horses old fashioned approach is supported by mr @entity1 ’s wife @entity5 by @entity6 published : 18:57 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 19:27 est , 18 april 2012 powerful and magnificent , the @entity8 horses kick up a haze of dust as they pull the heavy plough across a field			1
the nostalgic scene could come straight from the pages of a history book			0
or perhaps a modern sideshow to demonstrate the methods of a bygone age			0
yet this is just an ordinary working day for farmer @entity1 – who has chosen to ditch machinery to stay true to the traditional ways his family have used for five generations			1
horsing around : a normal working day for farmer @entity1 - who has chosen to ditch machinery to stay true to the traditional methods his family have used for five generations his beasts of burden may not be as fast as a tractor , but mr @entity1 believes they do a reliable – and often better – job			1
and such is his enthusiasm for the old methods , he did n’t even bother to fix a tractor he kept for occasional jobs such as trimming pastures when it broke down recently			0
so now his four strapping @entity8 horses do all the work			2
the 56 - year - old farmer takes them out each day to plough and roll the ground , to sow crops and to turn hay on his 265 - acre farm in @entity47			2
but his determination to remain loyal to the old ways brings its challenges			0
horse - drawn ploughs can no longer be bought , so mr @entity1 has had to convert all the machinery himself from equipment designed to be pulled by tractor			1
happy family : three generations of the @entity1 family in the yard of their old fashioned property			1
son @entity61 with daughters @entity62 and @entity64 and @entity1 with wife @entity5			1
horseplay : the end of the day - hard work , but @entity1 maintains it is much more satisfying than using a tractor sturdy stallions : four strapping @entity70 do all the work			1
the 56 - year - old farmer takes them out each day to plough and roll the ground , to sow crops and to turn hay on his 265 - acre farm in @entity47 hardworking : although it takes him three times as long to till the land as it would with a tractor @entity1 maintains the economic benefits as well as his enjoyment more than make up for the slightly slower progress the @entity1 family has owned @entity86 , near @entity87 , since 1882 , and it has always had working horses			1
‘ my father never fully mechanised the farm and we used horses in conjunction with tractors , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
‘ using horses is slow but for some jobs they are better , such as rolling crops , because the machine works better if you do it slowly			2
‘ we have 265 acres of land and they work on anything and everything			0
' i ’m doing my bit to save the environment because i am producing my own fuel and i am self - sufficient with the horses			0
‘ i do it because i enjoy it , i love it			0
people think i ’m mad and there are times when i think i am			0
’ a tractor is several times faster than horses			0
in a day it can plough ten acres of land compared with only two with horses			0
for grass cutting , a tractor is around three times faster			0
and for harrowing – smoothing the surface of the soil – a tractor can do six times as many acres in the same time			0
but despite its inefficiency , the old fashioned approach is supported by mr @entity1 ’s wife @entity5 , 56			1
‘ @entity1 gets a lot of pleasure from it , ’ she said			2
timeless : @entity1 with father @entity61 in the early 80 's			2
@entity1 says his determination to remain loyal to the old ways brings its challenges simple life : @entity1 's father @entity61 with his sisters on the farm in 1940			1
a modern tractor is several times faster than horses beautiful beasts : @entity61 ploughing the land in the late 60 's			0
for grass cutting , a tractor is around three times faster and for harrowing – smoothing the surface of the soil – a tractor can do six times as many acres in the same time beautiful scene : @entity1 says - ' i do it because i enjoy it , i love it			2
people think i 'm mad and there are times when i think i am ' @entity165 around : despite its inefficiency , the oldfashioned approach is supported by mr @entity1 's wife @entity5			1
