the egg , with runny sweet - salty caramel truffles within , is utterly delectable			0
for a hungry boy @entity24 , 90g , £ 3 , @entity25 ’s almost all little boys love cars and this is a great one ! big wheels , bright colours - and it 's got a huge chocolate egg inside			1
great value for something that will keep him busy for hours and hours			0
@entity25 's @entity36 for a sweet girl @entity39 egg box , 150g , £ 9.50 , @entity40 this lovely packaging reminds me of the toy sweet shop i had when i was a little girl			1
each of the six eggs in the box is filled with a treat : milk chocolate eggs , jelly beans or chocolate beans			0
@entity51 for the trendy teen @entity53 , 300g , £ 11.95 @entity54 this is great fun - and the moustache gives it some ' cool factor ' too ( they 're apparently very on trend )			2

@entity91 's delight luxury assortment of hollow eggs , 260g , £ 10 , @entity94 easter eggs this year are superb value and these ones are particularly fun - a line - up of five eggs : two dark , two milk and one white , with different toppings			1
the ginger is my favourite , but the raspberry , butterscotch and chocolate button options are also yummy			0
@entity108 from @entity94 for greedy granny @entity71 , 150g , £ 21.99 , @entity110 it 's not really befitting for a lady of a certain age to be bashing a large egg on the kitchen counter to crack it			1
but with this , she can simply open the pretty keep - sake box and inside are nine praline eggs and six sugar - coated eggs			2
for @entity121 @entity122 with @entity123 , 244g			0
£ 3.99 @entity124 nobody would ever guess this was from @entity124 - it 's very reasonable and the hollow chocolate egg is absolutely yummy			1

the @entity135 , £ 90 from @entity136 the @entity137 the @entity135 , 1.4kg , £ 90 , @entity136 and @entity138 yes , it 's very expensive , but was there ever an egg more deserving of its name ? the giant egg is filled with a series of five chocolate eggs			1

it is made of vanilla - flecked white chocolate , set with hazelnuts , almonds and pistachios			0
there ’s a little pouch inside the egg containing a pretty necklace and earrings , which makes the cost seem more reasonable ! @entity178 @entity179 , 120g , £ 4.99 @entity180 and @entity181 if you have a child or friend who is allergic to dairy products , this is the egg for them			2
it does n’t taste exactly the same as milk chocolate , but it ’s still pretty good and is a fantastic option for anyone with allergies as it is also gluten - , wheat - and egg - free			1
rococo praline filled egg shell for @entity197 rococo praline filled egg shell in eggcup , 40g , £ 9.95 @entity201 this is so clever			0
inside the little egg cup is a real hen 's eggshell - but filled with praline ! heat it in the microwave , then tap the top , and instead of soldiers , dip pieces of fruit into the smooth hazelnut praline inside			0
for your @entity214 30 hollow milk chocolate eggs , 500g , £ 10 @entity94 these are a bargain - the eggs work out at 33p each - and they are just the right size for an @entity214 : big enough so you can find them when they are hidden ; not so big that you have to worry if your kids find a few of them .			1
