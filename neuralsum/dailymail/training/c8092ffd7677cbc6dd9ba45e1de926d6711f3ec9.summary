by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 4 february 2013 @entity2 families are shelling out £ 2,000 a year more than people in other countries thanks to the high cost of transport , energy and property costs , according to new research			1
figures have shown that the cost of living in the @entity2 is 11per cent higher than the international average , and an incredible 18per cent higher than it is in the @entity14			1
among the biggest cost for @entity2 people is transport , which is a staggering 31per cent more than overseas thanks to high fuel duty , motoring costs and expensive public transport			1
expensive : @entity2 families are paying more for fuel and property as research shows that the cost of living in the @entity2 is 18per cent higher than in the @entity14 , and 11per cent higher than the rest of the world			1
costly : commuters such as those at @entity29 in @entity30 are victim to some of the highest public transport prices in the world the @entity35 and @entity36 ( @entity37 ) worked out how pricey life in the @entity2 is after analysing data created by the @entity40 ( @entity40 )			2
experts at the @entity37 also came to the conclusion that if they government brought down prices to be in line with international averages over the next decade , it could boost the economy by 15per cent			2
as well as high transport costs , @entity2 people also face paying 18per cent more for housing and utilities , such as water and fuel , 14per cent more on recreation and cultural activities , while restaurants and hotels are 12per cent more expensive			1
however , the researchers calculated that if prices of housing , commercial property , energy and transport were brought down to average levels over the next decade , it would save every @entity2 household more than £ 2,000 pounds a year			1
economy : @entity2 people , such as these shoppers on @entity72 , pay more for transport , recreation , restaurants and housing positive : experts have calculated that if costs were brought inline with those overseas it would save @entity2 families £ 2,000 a year ( file picture ) of course these cost savings could not be made overnight , ' said @entity37 chairman @entity83 at a lecture at @entity85 in @entity30 last month			1
' but supposing that they were phased in over 10 years , a rough and ready simulation suggests that they would be associated with a rise in gdp of around 15per cent compared with what would otherwise have happened			0
' such a boost would offset much of the growth weakness which i currently expect to see in the @entity2 over the coming years and would bring the rate of economic growth over this period to around the historic average of 2.5per cent			2
' mr @entity83 said that car usage was heavily taxed in the @entity2 and that public transport was among the highest in the world			0
he said that other high costs reflected the price of property			0
although the @entity40 figures show that it is more expensive to live in @entity2 than it is in the @entity14 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , the @entity2 is still a bargain compared to @entity110			2
the cost of living in the @entity113 country is 29per cent higher , and it is also pricier in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
the analysis from the @entity37 comes as the government continues to try and boost growth			0
the @entity121 was believed to be blocking @entity123 proposals for a ' plan a plus ' which would aim to boost the economy through housebuilding			0
last month figures released showed that the economy shrank by 0.3per cent in the final quarter of 2012 and had been flat for the rest of the year			0
a forecast of just 0.9per cent has been forecast by the @entity40 for 2013 , and new figures set to be released on wednesday were expected to deliver a similarly downbeat assessment of the @entity2 economy			0
contrast : figures from the @entity40 show that it is more expensive to live in @entity2 than in the @entity14 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 contrast : the cost of living in the @entity2 has been calculated to be 18per cent more than in the @entity14 higher : these cyclists in @entity143 , @entity110 face higher living costs than @entity2 families			1

costs 18per cent more to live in @entity2 than @entity14
high property prices also to blame
@entity151 could save money by bringing down costs , say experts
