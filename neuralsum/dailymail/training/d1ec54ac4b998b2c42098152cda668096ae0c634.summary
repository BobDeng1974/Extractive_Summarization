by @entity0 a young , overweight virgin who worried he would never find a girlfriend when the scales tipped 20 stone has launched himself into a fitness programme , toned up , lost five stone ... and found love			1
@entity8 , 21 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , struggled with weight all his life , was bullied during his school years and found it awkward and embarrassing even talking to girls			1
bullies called him ' the chubby kid ' and ' fatty boom boom ' , and would laugh at him when he got out of breath running up stairs			0
@entity8 before losing the weight , left , and now with his new girlfriend @entity21 , who says she is sure she would have fancied him even before he began working out he said : ' i always had some friends but most of them were cousins and i would never have gone up to a girl in school because i was so afraid they would laugh in my face			1
' when i got older everyone i knew was going on nights out and wearing trendy clothes and i could n't think of anything worse			2
' even after leaving school , he was left embarrassed by his 19st 8lb frame , turning down nights out with his friends in favour of staying in eating junk food			0
he gorged on a diet of fast food , always choosing the large option in places like @entity45 , and never turning down chocolate bars and crisps			2
@entity8 , pictured left before the weight loss and right after , said : ' my man boobs were so big i could easily have borrowed my sister 's bra to keep them up ' and when the weight kept piling on he used food as a comfort and ate continuously through the evenings , unable to pull himself out of his unhealthy lifestyle			1
he said : ' instead of helping myself i just got stuck in the same rut of eating everything that was bad for me and doing no exercise			0
' my man boobs were so big i could easily have borrowed my sister 's bra to keep them up			0
' i was so embarrassed about how i looked with my top off that i used to go swimming in a t - shirt			2
i did n't want anyone to see me			2
' but after attending a bodybuilding event with his cousin , @entity8 realised that he could n't deal with looking the way he was			1
@entity8 and @entity21 are now completely besotted with each other , and even though @entity8 has showed her pictures of himself before losing the weight , she says ' it does n't bother me ' ' i was really interested in doing bodybuilding , but my cousin told me that i would n't even be able to start trying until i had lost a serious amount of weight			1
' that night i stood in front of the mirror and was repulsed at what i saw			0
' i had spent the day surrounded by all these men that were toned and had amazing bodies and i was foolishly thinking that i could look like that if i just started lifting weights			0
' i then realised something needed to change as i could n't go on the way i was			0
' @entity8 said : ' the raspberry ketone pills really accelerated the weight loss i was already achieving through a better diet and exercise			1
i could not have done it without them ' raspberry ketone refers to the aroma compound of fresh raspberries			1
it is used in both the food and cosmetics industries for a fruity scent and flavour			0
approximately one kilogram of the fresh fruit is required to produce just 1 - 4mg of pure raspberry ketone			1
this makes it one of the most expensive natural food flavourings , at around $ 20,000 a kilogram			0
though raspberry ketone has been on the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) safe list since 1965 , it has only been marketed as a weight - loss supplement since 2004 after a study in @entity114 found it prevented weight increases in mice on a high - fat diet			1
no similar studies have been conducted on humans , and critics believe one would need to consume huge quantities of the product to see the same kind of results as the study with mice			0
@entity8 began researching diets on the internet and spotted an advert for @entity131 raspberry ketone supplement pills which he began taking alongside a high - protein diet			1
in five months he lost five stone			1
he said : ' i remember doing four weeks of really heavy duty training			0
i checked my weight and i had only lost 9lbs			2
' but by then i was hooked			0
gradually i learned more about diet and nutrition and the weight just fell off me			2
' the raspberry ketone pills really accelerated the weight loss i was already achieving through a better diet and exercise			1
i could not have done it without them			0
' then , at a family party , @entity8 could n't believe it when a girl took an interest in him : ' i could n't believe it when @entity21 told me she thought i was fit			1
i hated my body and could n't see how any woman would be attracted to me			0
' i have always had weight issues since i was a kid and could never imagine anyone would ever be interested in looking at me , even after i lost all the weight			2
' it was instant attraction between the couple , but @entity21 , 18 , says that she would still have spotted him if he had n't lost the weight			1
@entity21 , also from @entity159 , @entity10 , who is training to be a hairdresser , said : ' i spotted @entity8 and instantly thought he was gorgeous			1
' i sent my friend over to tell him at first as i was too shy but as soon as we got chatting i felt so comfortable around him			0
' he showed me pictures from before he lost weight and it did n't bother me			1
i got to know him and it 's his personality i fell for			0
' @entity168 managing director @entity167 said : ' we were delighted to help @entity8 achieve his ultimate goal			2
' he is lovely lad and we are thrilled that he has finally found happiness			0
' our @entity173 capsules are particularly popular with young men who like to body build like @entity8			2
they help them to lose crucial body fat so that they have a better body equilibrium when they do lose bulk			0
