she is one of the hottest stars in @entity2 , currently seen shaking her sari next to a muscle - bound hunchback in the most expensive and ambitious film ever to come out of @entity7			1
she receives thousands of letters , most declaring undying love , many asking for her hand in marriage			1
she has a chauffeur , a make - up team and stylist , a cleaner , a cook and a personal assistant			1
it is all the more surprising , then , that @entity19 , who was 23 yesterday , is a white girl from @entity20 with a girly @entity22 accent more reminiscent of a cutesy five - year - old than a silver - screen sex siren			1
her extraordinary story has taken her from the quiet suburban streets of @entity27 in @entity20 to a jet - set life which means she is mobbed if she sets foot outside her limousine in @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity33			1
yet she freely admits that her film career is a matter of pure chance : she had done no acting at all before her 2010 debut and could n't speak a word of @entity58			1
that did n't seem to bother leading ' @entity61 ' director a. @entity60 , who happened upon @entity19 's modelling picture after she won the @entity64 beauty contest at the age of 17 in 2009			1
they met in @entity67 two months later and he offered her the lead role in his 2010 movie @entity71			1
' i 'd never acted in my life , ' she says			1
' @entity74 asked if i could dance and i just said yes			2
i did n't tell him the only dancing i had done was on nights out in @entity20			2
he said he would arrange workshops and help me with the scripts and the language			2
he liked the fact that i was @entity81 but had an @entity7 look			2
' so , just before she turned 18 , @entity19 and her mother , @entity83 , a horse - riding instructor , found themselves in @entity7 meeting other actors and trying on costumes			1
@entity19 recalls : ' i 'd never been to @entity7 or anywhere like it			1
' there were cows wandering through the city			0
in the car on the way to the hotel i noticed @entity95 was grabbing on to the sides as we went in and out of traffic with the horn beeping			0
at one point a cow crossed the road in front of us and she screamed			0
' then she had to get used to the food			0
' at the start i could n't eat anything			0
i did n't like the spice			0
i loved having @entity7 take - aways on a friday night in @entity20 but it 's so different in the real @entity7			2
' while her friends spent their saturdays getting ' curly blow drys ' at the local hairdresser before hitting the town , @entity19 was working 20 - hour days in @entity33 , trying to learn the language			1
rise to stardom : @entity19 ( left ) freely admits her fame is a result of pure chance and she had never acted before her screen debut in 2010 @entity121 hit : her new film ' i ' is even attracted crowds in @entity51 where she is a relative unknown as an actress ' when my friends phoned before going out , i 'd be sat in my caravan on set with @entity95 learning @entity128 , ' she says			1
' we had a tv but it just played @entity7 shows so we did n't watch it			0
i was so jealous and homesick			0
' that all changed when @entity71 became the biggest movie hit of 2010			1
it turned @entity19 into an overnight star and the offers of more roles flooded in			1
this year alone she will star in no fewer than four @entity7 movies – and she has turned down nine other offers			2
@entity19 was so much in demand that she did n't even have to audition for the part of @entity143 in the much anticipated i. but it has n't all been plain sailing for @entity19 who has experienced racist abuse from a minority unhappy with her being cast as an @entity7 woman			1
on social media and website forums , they demanded to know what this ' foreigner ' , this ' fake ' and ' fluke actress ' who ' ca n't even speak @entity58 ' was doing in an @entity7 film			2
' everyone has an opinion , ' she says warily			0
' for me , as an actress you are playing a character and to play that character you have to get into that mindset			0
i do n't think it 's any disrespect to any race			0
if people enjoy your movies that 's the most important thing			0
' i is @entity19 's fifth @entity7 movie and is directed by @entity169 , the country 's answer to @entity172			1
loaded with special effects , it took her three years to make – and takes audiences three hours to watch			2
it tells the story of a top model ( @entity19 ) who enlists the help of a local body builder ( @entity182 )			1
the pair fall in love before he is deliberately infected with a hideous virus and turns into a gruesome hunchback			2
he then seeks revenge on the people who ruined his life			0
her south @entity7 voice was dubbed on to the pictures , but she did learn her lines in @entity128 , an official language of @entity7 , so that her lips would be in sync			0
she says the director wanted to make her look very @entity7			2
' even my mannerisms had to change			0
i was very soft and gentle , and a typical south @entity7 lady			0
i wore brown contact lenses , which is crazy because all the big @entity2 stars wear green ones			0
' @entity19 now splits her time between her sister 's home in @entity67 and her two - bedroom , apartment overlooking the @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity31			1
because of the crowds she attracts , she is flanked by two burly bodyguards , @entity213 and @entity214 , wherever she goes in @entity7			2
she has one male assistant ( ' he wakes me up in the mornings and makes all my juices for me ' ) , two hair and make - up people , one stylist , a driver and a housekeeper ( ' she helps with the cooking and cleans but @entity95 does n't like it			1
one time i walked in and they were both cleaning the floor together ' )			0
she insists she loves her ' gipsy ' life but does admit that being able to pop to the shops to buy a pint of milk or walk to the postbox to send a letter when she is in the @entity51 is a novelty			1
' i do n't really do any of that over there , ' @entity19 says describing how she draws a crowd from the moment she steps off the plane when she returns to @entity31			1
' it 's like two different worlds			0
everything is calm at home and i 'm just @entity19			1
' when she arrives in @entity7 , however , she finds she is mobbed			0
' the attention i get is unbelievable			0
people come up for pictures and autographs			0
they see that you 're out in the crowd and then you ca n't move			0
' you stop and take selfies with them			0
i love it to some extent , but on your days off it can be a bit much			2
i 've probably had more than 1,000 letters from @entity7 since the film opened			1
' a lot of the letters are from guys declaring their undying love			1
i do get marriage proposals – not official ones , obviously			0
they say , ' we 've watched the film six , seven or eight times			2
' that 's dedication ! '			0

she had never acted before her screen debut in 2010 film , @entity71
now @entity19 has a chauffeur , make - up team and a personal assistant
23 - year - old gets thousands of letters from men declaring their undying love
newest movie ' i ' is even attracting crowds in the @entity51 where she is unknown
