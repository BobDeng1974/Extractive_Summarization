@entity1 manager @entity0 has spoken to @entity3 's @entity2 ahead of their @entity4 last - 16 showdown with @entity6			1
here are the top 10 quotes from the interview with the @entity10 boss			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 has spoken to @entity3 's @entity2 @entity0 on @entity1 's triumphs last season going unrecognised ' we were fighting on all fronts			1
we won the @entity15 , reached the quarter - finals of the @entity17 , played in the @entity4 and we won the @entity4 scoring 157 goals			1
@entity20 only had one competition and that 's an enormous advantage			2
' @entity0 on @entity20 getting the attention ' the slip from ( @entity26 ) @entity25 ? they lost that game 2 - 0 , not 1 - 0			1
if he had not slipped , does it end in a draw ? we 'd still have been two points ahead of them			2
so why was it @entity20 losing the league and not us winning it ? ' @entity0 on being told to buy @entity38 players ‘ it is important to have @entity38 players but can you sign them ? can you get ( @entity41 ) @entity42 ? maybe if you go to @entity20 with £ 100million you can			1
if i want an @entity38 player in the position of ( @entity48 ) @entity47 who is there ? maybe ( @entity44 ) @entity43 , but who else ? ' @entity0 on @entity52 silverware ' @entity53 in all of that great era under ( sir @entity55 ) @entity55 only won two champions @entity56			1
@entity58 went 32 years without winning the @entity4			1
it is important to be there in the later rounds but you ca n't think that not being there is a disaster			2
' @entity0 poses with the @entity66 trophy in may 2014 after he saw his team win the title @entity0 on @entity6 ' you can talk about tactics and technique but if you go a man down against @entity6 , you 're put in a terrible position			1
it is not a disgrace to get knocked out by them			0
their squad , if it is not the best in the world , it is the second best			0
no other team can put together @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 but i want to play them with 11 and if they knock us out then let that be because they were better than us			2
' @entity90 on his days as a centre back before becoming a manager ' if you want to say i was a disaster of a player then say it			0
but give me another disaster of a player who played almost 500 games across 14 years			0
' @entity90 on @entity1 's riches ' this year @entity20 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity53 have all spent more than us			1
people do n't accept that we are trying to become a big club in a very short time			0
i do n't think there 's such a difference between the top five or six squads			2
' @entity0 feels @entity38 clubs are n't helped in @entity52 competitions by the domestic fixtures during winter @entity0 on the festive fixture list ' @entity38 football gives other leagues an advantage			1
there are some traditions you ca n't change , i realise that			0
but you ca n't play nine games in december and nine in january			0
you have to stop at some point			0
' @entity0 on @entity125 ' it would be very difficult to find a more complete player than @entity125			1
there are players who are better technically			0
there are players who head the ball better			0
but show me a player who does all the things that @entity125 does well and there is n't one			0
' you leave him on the bench and he is furious , but watch him during the game , encouraging and shouting			0
and in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes			0
it 's very difficult to find another @entity125 – an intelligent player , with big balls and a massive heart			2
' @entity0 on pressure in @entity38 compared to in @entity149 ' here the pressure is normal			1
there , it 's every day , and it 's life and death			2
i 've never had a problem with pressure because i believe in my own ability			0
last year i wanted to show i could win a major league in @entity52			0
this year the challenge is to repeat the title or to do better in the @entity4			2
' @entity0 has spoken to @entity3 about @entity125 , the pressure he feels and on their trophy aims			1
