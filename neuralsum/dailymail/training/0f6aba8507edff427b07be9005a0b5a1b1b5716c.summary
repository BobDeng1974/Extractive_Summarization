@entity0 is set for a january move after finding himself unwanted at @entity2 and @entity3 - and in @entity5 a film is being produced about the mercurial winger			1
the 27 - year - old former @entity8 player appears set for a january transfer after @entity2 manager @entity10 declared he did not want to take @entity0 back from his loan spell at @entity3 , where boss @entity12 has written him out of his plans			1
his agent @entity14 told 20minutes.fr : ' there are a lot of clubs interested in him , despite everything that has been said			1
he will have a new club in january , that wo n't be a problem , do n't you worry			2
' @entity0 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity25 , is currently back in @entity26 , @entity5 @entity10 ( right ) insists @entity0 will not be allowed to return to the @entity2 dressing room a surprising development , according to the same report , is the work - in - progress that is the documentary being made about the former @entity5 international			1
film - maker @entity33 , who produced a documentary series from 1999 to 2002 that featured the daily lives of @entity0 and a host of other young players at @entity5 's @entity41 football headquarters , has been given access to the footballer 's life away from the pitch			1
in the ' a la @entity41 ' series , the teenage @entity0 and fellow future professional @entity46 were seen grappling in an angry exchange			1
@entity33 said : ' i feel a little responsible for all the media exposure around @entity0 and the consequence this has had on his career			2
@entity0 has not appeared in any of @entity3 's last three games but will not be allowed to return to @entity55 ' this film , or this series - it has n't been decided yet - is a way to redress the balance			1
' we do n't always see the best of @entity63			0
i filmed him crying with those close to him , but he is a boy who is the total opposite to his reputation			0
he is sensitive , serious , fragile			0
people do n't have any idea of the obstacles he has had to overcome in his career			0
' @entity0 has played just nine times for @entity3 since his loan move from the @entity55 and @entity12 admitted on thursday that the relationship between player and club had almost certainly run its course			1
he denied media reports of a heated row with @entity0 , but is understood to be dismayed by the midfielder 's lack of work ethic - in training and in matches			2
@entity0 could be without a club in january as @entity2 are unwilling to take him back after his loan spell ' if he decides to stay in @entity5 that 's up to him , there 's only 10 days until the window opens and i think it 's fair to say he 's probably played his last game for @entity3 , ' said @entity12			1
' he did n't deserve to be in the team on merit			0
it 's my job to pick a team which i think will win a game on the saturday			2
all this reported bust - up and the rest of it ... i think you ( journalists ) want to make that story			0
' what i 've said to @entity0 is unfortunately i was n't going to accept a performance like i saw from him against @entity107			2
it 's up to him to force himself back into the squad , that 's the way it is			0
' sometimes transfers do n't work , especially with a loan deal			2
sometimes they can be the best thing for the player and the club			0
unfortunately it has n't worked out			0
i wish him the best of luck			0
i hope he goes on to have the career his talent deserves , that 's all i 've got to say on the matter			0
' @entity3 boss @entity12 claimed he was unaware of @entity0 's location when asked about him last weekend			1
