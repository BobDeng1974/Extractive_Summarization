a record high number of workers in part - time jobs has helped create the biggest fall in unemployment for 40 years			1
it means the jobless total is below two million for the first time since the recession struck in 2008 – with just 6 per cent of @entity9 now out of work			1
it follows a drop of 538,000 in the unemployment figure in the past year , the biggest since records began in 1972 , the @entity11 said			1
the number of people with jobs reached a record high of 30.7million and the @entity11 said the number of part - time workers also broke records at 6.8million			1
there are now 4.5million self - employed people , 279,000 more than a year ago			0
the increase in part - time workers was largely driven by women with young families , or those in their 50s and 60s returning after a career break			0
while the number of men working part - time rose by just 6,000 over the past year , there were an additional 138,000 women with part - time jobs – almost 380 a day			1
the fall in unemployment could place the @entity39 under more pressure to raise the base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent			1
@entity43 @entity43 , senior economist at @entity45 ’s @entity44 writes : ' unemployment is falling fast , but this is masking signs of a weaker labour market			2
' our economy is creating jobs , but at a fraction of the rate seen earlier this year			2
' the 154,000 person decrease in unemployment is a remarkable drop			2
' however , rather than being accompanied by a surge towards employment , we see individuals withdrawing from the labour market			0
' despite our growing population , 91,000 fewer working age people were either in work or looking for work in the three months to august , compared to three months before			2
' a shrinking labour market remains a cause for concern despite the economic recovery			0
' @entity69 , the @entity39 ’s governor , had indicated interest rates could rise when the unemployment rate fell below 7 per cent			1
but when the figure dropped below this threshold faster than expected , the @entity39 did not raise rates , saying it had to take into account low wage rises , gdp , investment and productivity			0
economists have predicted that with inflation well below the @entity39 ’s target of 2 per cent , rates may not rise until the summer			1
speaking at @entity86 ’s questions in the @entity87 yesterday , @entity84 seized on the unemployment fall as ‘ great news ’ but admitted there was ‘ more work to be done ’ as wages lag behind the cost of living			1
average pay grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months to august compared with 2013 , failing to keep pace with inflation at 1.2 per cent			1
@entity96 last night urged the @entity97 to recommend another inflation - busting rise in the minimum wage next year			2
earlier this month it was increased to £ 6.50			2
the chancellor said : ‘ we want to make sure that @entity9 ’s lowest paid continue to benefit from the growing economy , which is why the government has today stated its ambition to increase the real value of the national minimum wage without an adverse impact on employment			0
’ the number of people out of work and the unemployment rate for each @entity9 region : @entity115 , 119,000 , unemployment rate 9.3 % @entity117 , 233,000 , 6.7 % @entity118 and the @entity119 , 189,000 , 7 % @entity120 , 128,000 , 5.5 % @entity121 , 207,000 , 7.5 % east of @entity39 , 152,000 , 4.9 % @entity122 , 301,000 , 6.6 % @entity123 , 215,000 , 4.7 % @entity124 , 127,000 , 4.6 % @entity125 , 94,000 , 6.5 % @entity126 , 151,000 , 5.5 % @entity127 , 53,000 , 6.1 % @entity129 mps were keen to point out @entity130 had warned the government ’s austerity programme would cost a million jobs			1
in 2011 , shadow chancellor @entity134 said it was ‘ complete fantasy ’ to think the private sector could generate enough jobs to cope with public sector staff cuts			0
but figures show there are 1.4million more people in employment than there were three years ago			0
@entity129 mp @entity144 told the @entity87 yesterday : ‘ we are the true workers ’ party now , the modern trade union movement for hard - working people			0
’ @entity149 , @entity150 treasury chief secretary , hailed the figures as evidence of a ‘ jobs - rich economic recovery ’			0
but @entity130 work and pensions spokesman @entity155 said they mask a fall in real earnings			1
@entity161 ’s @entity160 said : ‘ this is a part - time recovery built on the back of low wages and an explosion of self - employment … leaving millions … without rights , security or guaranteed income			2
’ record levels of women in work have seen the number of stay - at - home mothers go into freefall , official figures show			1
the employment rate for women is 68 per cent , the highest since records began in 1971 , compared with 78 per cent of men			1
but as the figure for women in work tops 14million , the number of stay - at - home mothers has hit an all - time low of two million			1
twenty years ago there were almost three million			0
in the past 12 months there was a fall of 30,000 women caring for their children full - time			2
but stay - at - home fathers rose by 10,000 to 234,000 , more than double the number two decades ago			1
campaigners said many parents felt forced to return to work due to financial pressures and government policy , which they said favoured mothers in employment			2
from next september , couples who both work will receive up to £ 2,000 per child to help with childcare bills , to encourage women back to work			2
the scheme will allow working couples earning up to £ 300,000 to receive a 20 per cent rebate per child on their annual childcare costs			2
the tax break is in contrast to child benefit cuts in recent years , which hit one - earner families ’ incomes by more than £ 50,000			0
@entity215 , of @entity216 , said meagre wage rises and pressure from politicians to return to work or be considered ‘ lazy ’ had driven a fall in stay - at - home mothers			1
she added : ‘ according to @entity84 , it seems you are worthless unless you go out to work , but stay - at - home mothers work as hard as anyone else … [ and ] receive little support			1
’ from april , married couples can transfer £ 1,000 of income tax allowance to their spouse			0
this will benefit part - time workers and stay - at - home parents – although it will be worth only £ 200			0
@entity236 , of parenting site @entity237 , said returning to work was ‘ often not what mums want but is the only way they can make ends meet ’			2
@entity244 : good news , but part - time work and low pay means there ’s no tax bonanza welfare reforms , championed by @entity252 ( above ) , have made living off the @entity253 less attractive @entity9 's phenomenal pace of job creation , which has reduced the unemployment rate to 6 per cent of the workforce , is one of the great achievements of the @entity129 - led government			1
but it has come at a price – average earnings and living standards have been savaged , undermining the tax base of the economy			0
that people in @entity9 have been willing to get on their bikes and get jobs , many of them self - employed and part - time , is a huge tribute to the nation ’s work ethic and the positive impact of welfare reforms , championed by @entity252 , that have made living off the @entity253 less attractive			2
the @entity9 ’s strong job creation is reaching down to the young unemployed , contrasting starkly with the eurozone where the jobless rate is 11.2 per cent and above 50 per cent among young people in @entity279 and @entity280			1
the reasons why average earnings in @entity9 have not increased , as the market for labour has tightened , are complex			0
the main explanation is that new employees have been taken on to the payroll at lesser wages than a previous generation doing the same or equivalent work			1
in contrast to public sector workers protesting wage freezes and caps , employees in the wealth - creating sectors have been willing to accept below - inflation pay increases in recognition that the nation has been through the deepest downturn for a century and they need to contribute to restoring prosperity			0
the jobless total has fallen to two million since the government came to office and the participation rate , the broadest measure of the appetite for work , is now higher than in any other advanced economy in the world , including the fast growing @entity312			1
yet despite this , income tax receipts have failed to rise by the 6.5 per cent forecast by the independent @entity315 and have only risen 0.8 per cent			0
this makes if far more difficult for the chancellor @entity96 to achieve his revised goal of balancing the budget by 2017 - 18			0
many of the jobs created have been in expanding but lowly paid parts of the service economy including retail , hotels and food services , where pay can be up to 20 per cent below other sectors			0
moreover , the jobless rate has fallen fastest in poorer regions such as the @entity115 where average pay is less			0
in addition , the @entity332 ’s introduction of the £ 10,000 personal allowance has taken many workers out of tax and the chancellor is promising to raise this threshold to £ 12,500			0
the downward pressure on wages will not last forever			0
@entity39 interest - rate setter @entity341 argues that as the labour market tightens , with falling unemployment , employers will have to pay more for entry - level workers , pushing up average earnings			1
private sector forecasters note that salaries for advertised jobs are already outpacing inflation increasing at a 1.9 per cent annual rate			1
this suggests employers will have to improve the lot of existing staff if they do not want them to move elsewhere for higher pay			0
hard work and patience should finally be rewarded better .			0

@entity84 hails ' great news ' as number in work reaches 30.7million
