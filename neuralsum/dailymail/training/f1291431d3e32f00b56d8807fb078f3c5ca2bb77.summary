' if you look at this in the cold light of day we have gone through this rationally so many times in our minds			0
' @entity179 someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain			0

treatment : the @entity100 both spent the night at @entity188 and are expected to be taken to @entity29 court when they are discharged ' frankly that was a prospect we did n’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for			2
' we rationally weighted up all the options and saw no other choice			0
' we faced a three year wait for a trial in the @entity5 and we were already told we were going to be held in a high security super max prison with a pretty harsh regime and it would n’t have the medical facilities for my health			1
' we were facing the prospect of enduring eight years of hell , and are still facing the same dilemma			0
' it ’s a bit like when someone has a terminal illness , they will sometimes end their lives with the happy memories they once had rather than face the terminal illness			2
' what we did was n’t a publicity stunt , we fully expected not to be here today and we have to be grateful for the police and hospital staff for how they have looked after us over the last 24 hours			0
