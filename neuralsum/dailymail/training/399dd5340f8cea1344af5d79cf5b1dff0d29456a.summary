by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 14:00 est , 25 december 2012 ' privileged ' : the archbishop of @entity2 will use his last @entity4 message to say how he has been inspired by meeting people who have experienced great suffering such as victims of gang violence the archbishop of @entity2 spoke today of how he has been inspired by meeting people who have experienced great suffering , such as victims of gang violence			1
delivering his final @entity4 sermon from @entity12 , dr @entity10 also acknowledged how the @entity14 's vote against allowing women to become bishops last month has damaged the credibility of the @entity18			1
but he pointed out a reason to be positive in the recently published census statistics , which indicated that 59 per cent of people still identified themselves as @entity22			1
dr @entity10 , who steps down at the end of the month after a decade as head of the @entity18 , spoke of some of the people he has had the ' privilege ' to meet during his tenure			1
' when people respond to outrageous cruelty and violence with a hard - won readiness to understand and be reconciled , few if any can bring themselves to say that all this is an illusion , ' he will say			1
' the parents who have lost a child to gang violence , the wife who has seen her husband killed in front of her by an @entity59 mob in @entity60 , the woman who has struggled for years to comprehend and accept the rape and murder of her sister , the @entity40 and @entity41 friends who have been brought together by the fact that they have lost family members in the conflict and injustice that still racks the @entity46 - all these are specific people i have had the privilege of meeting as archbishop over these 10 years			2
' and in their willingness to explore the new humanity of forgiveness and rebuilding relations , without for a moment making light of their own or other people 's nightmare suffering , or trying to explain it away , these are the ones who make us see , who oblige us to turn aside and look , as if at a bush burning but not consumed			2
' @entity76 : dr @entity10 , pictured last month showing his disappointment after the @entity14 vote against allowing women bishops , said the decision had damaged the church rejection : a general view of the @entity83 of @entity84 , where a vote rejected legislation introducing the first women bishops referring to the 2011 census , he said that faith has to mean more than just ' what public opinion decides ' , and @entity93 should not lose heart			1
' we are after all , doing something rather outrageous , asking men and women to stop and look and turn around , and learn how to keep company with a figure whose outlines we often see only dimly , ' he told the congregation			2
dr @entity10 , who is to take up the posts of master of @entity106 and chairman of the board of trustees of @entity108 , is to be replaced by former oil executive the @entity111 @entity110 , the @entity112			1
meanwhile , the archbishop of @entity114 has celebrated @entity4 by calling on the nation to ' feed those who hunger ' and ' give shelter to the homeless '			1
positive message : the archbishop of @entity114 has celebrated @entity4 by calling on the nation to ' feed those who hunger ' and ' give shelter to the homeless ' @entity124 told the congregation at @entity126 : ' @entity127 works through human agents to achieve his purposes			1
' so let us feed those who hunger with the bread come down from heaven			2
' let us give shelter to the homeless with him who could find no room in the inn			2
let us welcome him into the inn of our lives , so we might be fully alive , fully human again			2
' the archbishop - the second most senior cleric in the @entity18 - invoked @entity145 's dystopian novel @entity146 to send a message of hope and the power of humanity			1
he said : ' the novel ends with hope : brutality is turned into compassion , betrayal into loyalty , enmity into friendship , despair into hope , self - absorption into inter-dependence , death into life			2
' how ? not by @entity166 science discovering the solution , nor by the plans and schemes of those in power			2
' but it 's the vulnerable who rise up and neutralise the jealousy , treachery , violence , murder , evil and the intoxication of power			2
' dr @entity124 said @entity180 's birth meant ' religious beliefs were translated out of words into humanity , life and spirit , out of the intellect into the simple impulses of the soul '			2
he added : ' yes			2
his rule is characterised by everlasting justice and righteousness , instead of the ruthless greed and exploitation which prevailed when he was born and is prevailing now in our global village			2
' the archbishop said : ' in @entity127 's eyes , the quality of our relationships is more important than the rightness of our convictions			0
' sadly , as followers of @entity180 , we are often bad at learning how to disagree , but we do need to remain in harmony			0
we must ' make every effort to keep the unity of the @entity208 through the bond of peace ' - as @entity211 says in @entity212			0
the archbishops of @entity2 and @entity114 will tweet their sermons for the first time today to ' bring the meaning of @entity4 to a new digital audience ' ' if we can not experience and demonstrate the reality of this in @entity180 , what have we to offer to the rest of society , with its fractured relationships ? ' the archbishops of @entity2 and @entity114 tweeted their sermons for the first time today to ' bring the meaning of @entity4 to a new digital audience '			1
dr @entity10 and dr @entity124 - with the incoming archbishop of @entity2 , @entity110 - delivered their @entity4 messages simultaneously from their pulpits and over the micro-blogging site			1
their words will be ' live tweeted ' to the @entity233 's 10 million @entity232 users as part of a campaign to reach out to social networkers across the country			0
the @entity18 has asked members in its 16,000 parishes to join in by tweeting snippets from services containing the hashtag # @entity242 to spread the @entity22 message			1
a @entity232 spokesman said : ' it is fantastic to see the @entity18 embracing @entity232 and using it to share their @entity4 message with new audiences			1
' dr @entity10 has previously branded the site a potentially ' poisonous ' and destructive tool			1
but he has also spoken of its power when used to do good			0
the outgoing archbishop - who does not own a mobile phone and admits he struggles with ' any kind ' of technology - addressed the issue earlier this month when he said it was often assumed that clergy were ' too unworldly ' for social media			0
but he insisted not all clergy should be assumed to be as ' dim ' as he is in this area			0
@entity232 users were able to track the sermons at @entity12 , @entity266 and @entity126 by following dr @entity10 ( @ lambethpalace ) , dr @entity124 ( @ johnsentamu ) and the archbishop @entity267 , @entity110 ( @ bishopofdurham ) , who already has nearly 15,000 followers			1
dr @entity10 will stand down as @entity267 at the end of this month after a decade in office			1
he will take up a new post as master of @entity273 , @entity106 and will also serve as chairman of the board of trustees at @entity108 , the international development agency			0
@entity110 will be enthroned as his successor at @entity12 in march			0
the next archbishop of @entity2 has admitted it is easy to be despondent but used his @entity4 sermon to stress ' the main job of the @entity18 is never self - preservation , but glorifying @entity127 '			1
the @entity111 @entity110 , @entity112 , told @entity266 : " it is very easy to be despondent about the @entity18			1
' some speak of division and even of betrayal			0
' the processes we go through are agonisingly wounding for many			0
' there are profound differences of opinion about the nature of @entity22 truth and its place in society , about the right of an ancient tradition to dictate or even to advocate ethical values around the end of life , around marriage , around the nature of human relationships , inequality , our duty to each other			1
" and the bishop said : " it is even easier to be despondent about the world			0
' from the horrors of forgotten @entity310 in the @entity311 ( @entity311 ) to the atrocity in @entity313 , and from @entity314 in @entity315 to tribal struggles in @entity317 , and in so many places between , there is the usual diet of tragedy and loss			0
' near at home we remain in the economic doldrums and seem to find a perverse pleasure in emphasising the impossibility of trusting any institution			0
' but he told worshippers it was important to ' recognise that @entity127 's answer to all our despondency or triumph is to come in weakness as a child , to become utterly vulnerable '			0
@entity110 said : ' @entity93 reach to the jagged edges of our society , and of the world in general			0
' food distribution , places for rough sleepers , debt counselling , credit unions , community mediation , support for ex-offenders , support for victims of crime , care for the dying , valuing those who have no economic contribution to make , or are too weak to argue for their own value			0
' all this is the daily work of the church , which goes on every day and everywhere			0
we leak out into the world the love that @entity127 leaks into us			0
' the bishop said that despite only two - thirds of people now identifying with the @entity22 faith , ' we would never hear the end of it ' if this figure was associated with a political party			1
and he said : ' the main job of the church is never self - preservation , but glorifying @entity127			0
' the moment we lose sight of that , we lose everything we are about			0
the same is true for us as individual @entity93			0
' @entity110 was chosen in september to succeed @entity10 as archbishop of @entity2			1
he is expected to take up the post next year .			0

dr @entity10 also said women bishops vote has damaged @entity18
but he points to positive census which showed 59 *%* of people still identified themselves as @entity22
it was his final @entity4 sermon after serving a decade in office
