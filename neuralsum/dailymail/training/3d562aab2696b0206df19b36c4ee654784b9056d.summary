by @entity0 it 's been four months since reports of a reversible usb plug started doing the rounds , and the project just took a step forward as images of the cable surfaced online			1
the artist 's renderings , created by @entity12 manufacturer @entity11 , show what the new cables will look like , and how the ports on the side of electronic devices are set to change			1
called the usb type - @entity19 , it has been designed for use with thinner , sleeker devices , such as tablets and ultrabooks , and solves the annoying problem of inserting drives the wrong way up			1
the images , pictured , created by @entity12 manufacturer @entity11 , show what the new reversible cables could look like			1
the @entity19 is built on existing @entity32 and usb 2.0 technologies			1
captions on the images state they are ' artist renderings courtesy of @entity11 ' and ' final designs are subject to change ' the usb type - c connector has been designed for use with thinner , sleeker devices , such as tablets and ultrabooks			1
it is being built on existing @entity32 and usb 2.0 technologies			0
the plug is smaller than current laptop connectors , and more closely resembles the size of the current @entity48			0
crucially , it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in			0
this is similar to how @entity56 's @entity55 connector works			1
the usb 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001 , followed by @entity60 in 2008 , and 3.1 in july 2013			0
@entity56 uses its own @entity55 on newer models of @entity62 and @entity63 , which can be inserted either way up			2
the @entity19 will work in a similar way , while resembling the size of the current @entity48 plug			0
according to the @entity68 , the @entity19 will be ‘ the only connector one will need across all devices			2
’ crucially , however , as the new design is different to the current versions of usb plugs , users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs			1
the usb @entity19 , artist 's impression pictured , has been designed for use with thinner , sleeker devices , such as tablets and ultrabooks			1
the design and full specifications have not been released yet , but the final design is expected by the summer @entity86 , chairman of the promoter group , said the plug is being developed ‘ to help enable thinner and sleeker product designs , enhance usability and provide a growth path for performance enhancements for future versions of usb			0
' the @entity19 is built on existing @entity32 and usb 2.0 technologies			2

' the usb 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became standard by the end of 2001 , followed by usb 3.0 in 2008 , and 3.1 in july 2013			0
these plugs have been criticised because they can only be inserted one way up the design and full specifications have not been released yet , but the @entity108 claimed the images reflect its preferred design			0
the final design is expected to be released by the summer			0
@entity112 of @entity113 said his company ‘ is excited to see the development of the new thin @entity19 as it will enable an entirely new super-thin class of devices from phones to tablets , to 2 - in - 1s , to laptops to desktops and a multitude of other more specific usage devices			0

the @entity32 type - c connector is being designed for use with thinner devices
it will be reversible and work in the same way as @entity56 's @entity55 cable
the artist 's renderings were created by @entity12 manufacturer @entity11
users of older devices will need an adapter to use the new @entity19 plugs
the design of the connector is set to be finalised by the *middle* of the year
