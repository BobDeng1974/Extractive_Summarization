bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows			1
researchers found those from disadvantaged families were far less likely to study and score highly in @entity7 , maths , science , humanities and languages			1
pupils who do not take these so - called ‘ facilitating ’ subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious @entity17 universities , which often favour them			1
bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows ( file picture ) researchers commissioned by the @entity22 at @entity23 also found poor children are much less likely to get three a-levels in any courses			2
the wide - ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery , reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil 's chances of getting good results			1
taking part in school trips and getting into a daily homework routine can also help them			0
the research is based on data drawn from more than 3,000 young people who have been tracked from the age of three for the @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 ( @entity46 ) project			0
researchers found that just a third of bright but disadvantaged students took one of more a-levels facilitating subjects , compared to 58 per cent of their wealthier peers with the same academic ability			2
less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a b in these subjects , compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates			0
the findings also show that just over 35 per cent of the sixth - formers identified as clever based on their test results at age 11 got three a-levels in any subjects , compared to 60 per cent of their high - achieving , richer peers			2
an analysis of the data found that sixth - formers who did two to three hours of homework each night were nine times more likely to gain three a-levels than those who did none			0
less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a b in these subjects , compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates ( file picture ) the study said : ‘ spending time on homework is likely to reflect both student motivation and engagement , study skills and independence , school policies and the priority teachers attach to encouraging students to study at home ( or provide opportunities after school ) , as well as parental attitudes and support			2
’ the study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure , educational trips , the chance to go to a good nursery and school , feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results			1
it suggests that bright , poor students should get ‘ enrichment ’ vouchers , funded through the @entity109 - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips , reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom			1
sir @entity116 , chairman of the @entity117 which commissioned the report , said : ‘ the fact that bright disadvantaged students fall so far behind when they reach their a-levels shows that government and schools urgently need to do more to support able students from less advantaged homes			0
‘ we must ensure that access to the best schools and opportunities for academic enrichment outside school are available to all students			0
it is also vital that schools advise their students on the right subject choices at @entity137 and a-level so as to maximise their potential			0
’ professor @entity153 , co-author of the report , said : ‘ there is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools , the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education			1
there are important lessons here for teachers and policymakers seeking to reduce the equity gap in attainment			0

disadvantaged pupils less likely to score well in science and humanities
pupils who do not study these less likely to go to @entity17 university
but going to decent nursery and reading for pleasure can boost chances of good results
