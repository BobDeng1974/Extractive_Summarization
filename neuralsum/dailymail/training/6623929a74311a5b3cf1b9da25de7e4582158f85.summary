mr @entity5 would spend nine minutes in the tanning booths up to four times a week and continued this routine for eight years			1
but his addiction has come at a huge price			0
doctors diagnosed him with melanoma , the deadliest type of skin cancer , in 2010 after he spotted a mole on his thigh			1
then , last march , they gave him just 10 months to live after discovering the cancer was not curable			1
treatment has prolonged mr @entity5 ’s life but he now deeply regrets his years of sunbed use			1
the ex-tradesman , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' i loved the confidence having a tan gave me and everyone would say how healthy i looked			0

image ( left ) shows the scar from surgery to remove the cancerous mole and ( right ) shows him when he was using sunbeds mr @entity5 ( pictured when he was using sunbeds ) went for a tanning session up to four times a week ' i could n't go anywhere unless i had been on the sunbeds first			1
' pretty much everyone in my life at that time used the sunbeds , so i thought i would give them a go			2
' i just did n't feel normal without a tan and my confidence in the way i would look would go right down without them			0
symptoms that may indicate skin cancer include any mole , spot , lump or area of skin that : source : @entity67 ' to find out i had melanoma was the worst feeling in the world			2
' i felt completely numb and found it very hard to function properly for days , people would try talking to me but nothing would register			0
' now i 'm just trying to be as happy as possible with the time i 've got left			2
' doctors told me i had six to ten months to live last march but at the time they did n't have much feedback on the drugs i was taking			1
' thankfully the drugs have worked longer then they originally thought			0
' however i 'm still in the same position , the drugs will always stop working in every case - it is just a question of when			0
' mr @entity5 now wants to raise awareness of skin cancer and raise funds for @entity88			1
he has support from @entity91 star @entity90 , who plays landlord @entity92 , and he met soap star @entity93 as a surprise treat from a friend			0
the actor has invited him to @entity90 's @entity97 at the @entity98 in @entity32 on july 5 to warn people about the dangers of indoor and outdoor tanning			2
he said : ' it 's been horrific at times because i know how much it hurts my family to see me like this			0
' people are quite literally dying for a tan and it really is n't worth it			0
’ mr @entity5 is now trying to raise awareness of the dangers of sunbeds as well as raising money for charity @entity116 , senior health information officer at @entity88 , said : ' far from improving your looks , the uv radiation given off by sunbeds can make skin look wrinkled , leathery and old before it 's time , and it also damages the dna in your skin cells			1
' over time this damage can build up and may lead to skin cancer			2
if you 're really desperate for a tan it 's better to fake it			0
' see your doctor if you notice any changes in the size , shape or colour of a mole or normal patch of skin			0
' mr @entity5 is using his @entity143 @ mymelanomafight and @entity146 page to reach a target of £ 10,000 and has so far raised more than £ 2,000			2
