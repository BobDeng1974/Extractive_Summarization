' i just delivered and it 's supposed to be this beautiful , wonderful , happy time and i 'm being accused of something that 's completely ridiculous , ' @entity12 said			0

' furious : first - time mother @entity12 ( pictured with @entity30 ) is suing the @entity7 hospital which claimed she tested positive for heroin during labor and shared the results with child welfare a @entity15 spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit filed tuesday			1
opiates like heroin are made from poppies , which is why the seeds can result in false positives on drug tests			1
but @entity12 said she did n't realize what prompted the failed drug test until weeks later - when she bought the same kind of bread she had eaten ate the day before she went into labor and saw poppy seeds when she sliced into it			1
last year , another @entity50 woman settled a lawsuit with @entity52 in @entity53 for $ 143,500 , after a county child welfare worker seized the woman 's newborn in 2010 after that mother also tested positive for drugs after eating a poppy seed bagel			1
@entity12 's attorney , @entity60 , said there were no medical reasons to test @entity12 for drugs , saying she was a ' model ' patient			0
@entity65 : @entity12 said she realized weeks after her drug test that it was the poppy seeds in bread she 'd eaten before labor which caused the false test frightening : @entity12 , 31 ( right ) was allegedly told that she would have to surrender her parental rights to her husband ( left ) if she did drugs again and when the urine sample came back as an ' unconfirmed positive ' the results even included the disclaimer , ' these results are to be used only for medical purposes			1
unconfirmed screening results must not be used for non-medical purposes ( e.g. employment testing , legal testing ) , ' the lawsuit stated			0
except that 's exactly what @entity15 did , @entity12 claims , when they referred her case to @entity88 's @entity87			2
within hours of her daughter 's birth , a nurse took a urine sample from the child who was monitored for withdrawal symptoms			0
the next day , a hospital social worker interrupted @entity12 while breastfeeding ' and demanded information about her alleged drug use '			2
@entity12 told the social worker she did n't use drugs and , although their daughter 's tests were also negative , the hospital social worker still referred the case to @entity104 as @entity12 and the baby were being discharged june 26			2
lawsuit : @entity12 is suing @entity14 in @entity7 ( pictured ) for allegedly drug - testing her without consent and sharing the false results with child services a @entity104 caseworker visited the @entity111 later that day , and scheduled a july 5 inspection of their home			1
a @entity104 investigator referred the case to a drug addiction counselor and required @entity12 to sign a ' safety plan ' acknowledging she 'd surrender her parental rights to her husband if she did drugs again			2
@entity104 workers inspected the home repeatedly in the coming weeks , and the drug counselor told @entity12 she planned to recommend future random drug tests , even after @entity12 passed another urine test			0
eventually , the @entity104 investigator opted not to require the drug tests , though the agency has yet to send @entity12 a letter confirming her case has been closed			0
the agency does n't comment publicly on child welfare cases			0
' the @entity133 are very , very fortunate that @entity104 did n't take their baby away and @entity15 knows that risk exists whenever they make one of these reports , ' @entity132 said			0
