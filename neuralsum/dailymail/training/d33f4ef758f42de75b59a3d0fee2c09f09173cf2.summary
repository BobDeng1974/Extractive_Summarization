goals either side of half time from @entity2 and @entity3 saw @entity5 return to winning ways in the @entity7 as they beat @entity8 at @entity9			1
@entity11 's @entity10 runs through how the players performed			1
@entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity13 - 7 the goalkeeper was to thank for keeping @entity5 from going behind in the first half , despite making only his second league start			2
@entity17 - 6.5 played a great ball to pick out @entity2 at the back post , after receiving a corner kick from @entity21 , to put @entity5 ahead			1
right back @entity17 stretches to get a touch on the ball as @entity24 looks on @entity25 - 6 put in a competent display in his first @entity7 start , but @entity5 lacked the usual defensive assuredness with @entity30 alongside @entity31			0
@entity31 - 5 not his usual commanding self , easily between twice in the first half , by @entity34 and @entity35 , but @entity13 saved him the first time and the post the next			1
@entity38 - 6 his afternoon was ended prematurely when he came off with an injury in the first half and left little mark on the game			2
@entity5 captain @entity31 heads clear as @entity42 puts pressure on @entity25 @entity44 - 6 a few stray passes , when @entity44 is usually so certain to find his man , but was strong and solid in the middle of the park			0
@entity50 - 6 biggest shock of the day was that he did not get an assist , but when @entity5 finally started to dominate in the second half he kept their midfield ticking along			2
@entity21 - 6.5 acted fast to play a quick corner to @entity17 which resulted in @entity5 's first goal and sent a free kick heading into the top right corner only to be saved			2
@entity5 midfielder @entity50 battles for possession with @entity8 's @entity42 @entity2 - 7.5 sent @entity5 ahead with a calm finish at the back post then played an exquisite back - heel flick to set up @entity3 for their second			1
@entity64 - 6.5 quiet in the first half , not his usual dominating form on the ball , but produced a lovely clipped ball for @entity2 to skilfully put in @entity3 's path for the second goal			1
@entity3 - 6.5 scored the goal which put the game beyond doubt for @entity5 in an afternoon that @entity8 could 've got something from			1
@entity2 celebrates after giving @entity5 the lead just before half time at @entity9 substitutes @entity79 - 6 put in a solid performance down the left flank after coming on to replace the injured @entity38			1
@entity82 came on for @entity2 to provide a bit more stability to the midfield with the game virtually out of reach for @entity8			1
@entity88 got some stick from @entity8 fans , where he used to play , but provided some fresh legs in the final moments			0
@entity3 looks to the heavens in celebration after doubling @entity5 's lead 15 minutes into the second half @entity8 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity97 - 6 little that @entity97 could do about @entity5 's opener but was solid in his first return since november , after seven weeks out with an ankle injury			1
@entity101 - 6 sprightly at right - back but managed to nullify hazard to a certain extent , which is no mean feat. @entity105 - 6 excellent sliding clearance to stop @entity3 adding a third after the @entity5 striker had beaten four of his team - mates			1
@entity97 and @entity101 can do can do nothing to stop @entity2 opening the scoring as the ball squeezes in @entity113 - 6 @entity3 proved too much of a handful for the centre - back in the end who was well organised throughout			1
@entity118 - 6 received a yellow card for a late challenge on @entity21 , but overall coped well with the @entity122 winger			2
@entity35 - 6.5 rattled the right post after leaving @entity31 for dead to almost open the scoring for @entity8			0
@entity8 midfielder @entity35 is beaten in the by @entity31 , and takes a whack in the back @entity127 - 6 did well breaking up @entity5 's midfield rhythm with interceptions and the odd niggling foul			2
@entity131 - 6 did a similar job to @entity127 , disrupting @entity5 's forward play which has been so fluid and devastating this season			0
@entity34 - 7 constantly causing @entity5 's defence problems by popping up in spaces between them and often beating two or three with his skill			0
denied by a great diving save from @entity13			0
@entity34 manages to get a shot away , but fails to score , as @entity31 bears down on the @entity141 @entity42 - 5.5 while @entity34 was drawing @entity143 's defenders all over the pitch , @entity42 failed to capitalise on the spaces and proved little threat			0
@entity24 - 6 hit a bullet of a free kick that was well - saved by @entity13 , but failed to match impact up front of @entity34 who needed an ally to unlock @entity5			0
substitutes @entity153 - 6 almost caught out @entity13 with a cross that was mis - hit but heading on target soon after coming on			0
@entity156 not long enough to make an impression on the game after coming on in the final five minutes			0
@entity42 goes in for a strong challenge on @entity5 midfielder @entity44			0

@entity122 midfielder @entity2 opened the scoring just before half time
@entity3 sealed the win when he doubled the lead in the second half
