for most people a hangover will have them reaching for the painkillers and greasy breakfast , but those living in ancient @entity4 had a rather different approach			1
historians have discovered a 1,900 - year - old hangover cure written on an ancient @entity4 papyrus			1
written in @entity9 , one of the medical recipes offers advice for how to tackle a ' drunken headache ' - with the leaves of a shrub called @entity17 chamaedaphne , or sometimes @entity17 laurel			1
the text recommends stringing the leaves of the evergreen plant , also called @entity22 , together and possibly wearing it around the neck			1
this papyrus was found in @entity26 , @entity4 , and contains a medical ' recipe ' for treating a hangover while the text recommends this as a way of relieving headaches brought on by alcohol , it is not known if it had any effect			1
the treatment was discovered as part of an ongoing effort to translate the @entity26 papyrus - more than 500,000 documents found in an ancient rubbish tip at the @entity4 town of @entity26 , about 100 miles south of @entity43			1
@entity26 lies south west of @entity43 and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in @entity4			1
it has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the @entity51 and @entity52 periods of @entity4 history and among them are fragments of plays and the @entity57			1
the city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills , including lots of written material as @entity26 was governed bureaucratically by the @entity66 and the @entity67			1
archaeologists have discovered tax returns , census material , receipts , letters about religion , politics , military action and diaries , giving them a thorough picture of everyday life			0
in 1896 , two young excavators - @entity80 and @entity81 - from the @entity82 began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish			0
while they were concerned with finding works of high literature , they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material			0
some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university 's @entity92 ; among them the account of match fixing			0
the hangover treatment was one of 24 new medical texts that are the latest to be translated - the 101st volume of translations to be published			1
among the documents , researchers at the @entity82 and @entity103 have found 11 copies of known medical texts by @entity107 and @entity108 alongside the new medical texts			1
they also found four documents that appeared to be doctors notes			1
dr @entity112 , a historian and research fellow at the @entity114 who translated the medical papyrus , said : ' the remedies appear to cross what we might see as the boundary between magic and medicine - and although some ancient doctors disliked making use of " magical " remedies , this was far from always the case			0
' the recipe for drunken headache - kraipale in @entity9 - read : ' for drunken headache : wear leaves of @entity17 chamaedaphne strung together			1
' dr @entity112 said : ' the plant name literally means " ground laurel / bay " , and its leaves are often compared to bay leaves in ancient botanical literature			2
' the papyrus were discovered during excavations at @entity26 in 1890 by @entity80 and @entity81 from @entity140 at the @entity141			2
around 10 per cent of the papyri have been found to be literary and many are private documents , codes , registers , official correspondence , tax records , bills , leases , horoscopes and inventories			2
@entity17 chamaedaphne , sometimes called @entity153 ( above ) was recommended as a cure for hangovers in @entity4 1,900 years ago by stringing the leaves in a garland that was hung around the neck dr @entity159 , a papyrologist at the @entity160 , which owns the papyrus texts , said : ' these texts are hugely important as they give us an insight into daily life at the time			1
' some were copies of ancient @entity9 medical texts but there were some original medical texts - which look more like magical spells in some ways			2
' the hangover cure for example involves handing a laurel around the neck			2
i have my doubts if this would have worked but perhaps it had more of a placebo effect			0
' professor @entity182 , a historian at @entity103 who was one of those taking part in the translations , described them as ' the largest single collection of medical papyri to be published			0
' hundreds of thousands of texts written on papyrus were found at @entity26 during the excavation ( above ) the papyrus are owned by the @entity160 and kept at the @entity92 at the @entity82			1
the medical documents all date from the first century ad to the sixth century @entity195			2
these images of some of the medical papyrus found at @entity26 contain descriptions for treating eye conditions , fever and haemorrhoids with surgery it is thought the hangover cure may have been necessary as many ancient societies drank wine rather than water , which was unsanitised			1
the newly translated medical texts also include recipes for helping to halt the spread of ulcers , others for treating hemorrhoids , toothache , gangrene and a dozen for treating eye conditions			1
one recipe describes the need to rub a decapitated ant onto a stye			0
another for treating a discharge of mucus from the eyes called rheum , uses a mixture of copper flakes , antimony oxide , white lead , washed lead dross , starch , dried roses , rain water , gum arabic , poppy juice and a plant called @entity240 spikenard			2
another gruesome text explains the technique for eye surgery to treat someone whose eyelid had turned inside out			2
while fragmented , it still makes unpleasant reading			0
it says : ' the eye ... i began ... by the temple ... the other from the temple ... to remove with a small round - bladed knife ... the edge of the eyelid from outside ... from within until i scooped out			2
' dr @entity112 said many of the recipes could have been written out like prescriptions for people to follow			0
he said : ' we tried to give a good selection of different types of medical text in the volume			0
' for example there are scholarly commentaries on famous medical writings , surgical texts , handbooks for students giving definitions of medical terms , treatises on acute diseases , as well as instructions on preparing perfumed oils - which could be used for medical purposes - and medical recipes			2
the documents were found at the ancient town of @entity26 , in @entity4 around 100miles ( 160km ) form @entity43 ' one of the fragments contains a detailed description of the surgical procedure for removing haemorrhoids , though the author emphasises that in operating on the patient one of the haemorrhoids must be left untouched			1
' two others offer in - depth discussions of different kinds of fever and their treatment			0
' it â€™s natural to assume that most of these @entity298 will have been bought or copied by doctors too for their own use			0
' on the other hand , some of the medical recipes may have been copied out by ordinary individuals , so that they could have particular remedies to hand for themselves or their families			0
' this papyrus is an example of texts discoverd at @entity26 and features @entity310 ancient @entity4 would did not have modern hangover cures and used strings of leaves instead , according to new translations of 1,900 year old texts found at @entity26 in @entity4			1
image above posed by a model the longest medical papyrus ever found is the @entity319 ( pictured )			0
it contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders texts found on the site of @entity326 identify a workman on the crew designated as the ' swnw ' , or physician			1
the physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues			0
this physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus			0
these texts acted like a reference book for the ancient @entity4 medical practitioner , listing individual treatments for different ailments			1
the longest of these ever found is called @entity319 and contains more than 800 treatments covering eye problems to digestive disorders			2
the source of the papyrus is unknown , but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the @entity354 necropolis			0
a suggested treatment for a condition that had symptoms similar to asthma is listed as a mixture of herbs heated on a brick so the sufferer could inhale the fumes			0
another treatment , this time for intestinal worms , required the physician to cook the cores of dates and a desert plant called colocynth together in sweet beer			0
he would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days			0
while smearing a paste of dates , acacia , and honey to wool and applying it as a pessary would be used as a form of contraception by the worker 's wives .			0
