@entity0 is a weird and wonderful world of odd rocks that formed long ago in the planet ’s history			1
and this latest image is no exception , as the @entity6 has spotted what looks like a bizarre set of ‘ traffic lights ’ on the surface			1
of course , the discovery is nothing more than a chance alignment of rocks and shapes - but it highlights just how interesting the @entity0 surface is			1
@entity24 - based @entity23 is yet to comment on the latest discovery			1
the finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on @entity0 can be in the image , a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are stacked on top of each other			1
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity0			2
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity0			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity42 at approximately 900kg ( 2,000lbs )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity45			0
they bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on @entity48			2
but it ’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation			0
the image was shot from the six - foot ( 1.8 metre ) high , left - hand side mast cam on the @entity6			2
it was the 753rd day the rover has been exploring the red planet			1
the rock was spotted in the image by space video journalist @entity59 from @entity61 who runs a @entity63 channel called @entity64			2
‘ i saw this one and i thought “ hang on , that looks a bit strange ”			0
i think it looks like a traffic light			0
‘ it is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference , but i would estimate it was about 12 inches [ 30.5cm ]			0
‘ i posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole			1
’ the ' traffic lights ' ( left ) were spotted by @entity6 ( right ) on its way to the base of @entity88 , a geologically fascinating region that could explain how @entity0 lost its wet and habitable environment			1
other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole the rock was spotted by space video journalist @entity59			0

the image from @entity6 is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on @entity48 just days earlier , @entity6 had spotted a ball - shaped rock on the surface of @entity0			1
@entity23 said it was likely an example of @entity0 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter , according to @entity117			2
curiosity is currently at the base of @entity88 , which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago			2
the area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of @entity0			1
and , scientists hope the region might reveal how and why @entity0 lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment , with water flowing on its surface			1
this , in turn , may provide answers on the future of @entity48			0
the discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the @entity131 ( shown )			1
@entity23 said it was likely an example of @entity0 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter yesterday @entity145 's first mission to @entity0 , the @entity147 's @entity146 , arrived at @entity0 and released its first image ( shown ) of the red planet 's surface			1
' @entity151 ? keep in touch			0
i 'll be around ' the team for the orbiter tweeted on its arrival			0
