@entity1 cabinet minister @entity0 was accused of hypocrisy last night after it emerged that a huge bonus he received as a £ 3 million - a - year @entity6 banker was channelled through a tax haven			1
mr @entity0 , 45 , was promoted to @entity8 earlier this month from his berth as a treasury minister , where he was highly critical of @entity6 tax - avoidance schemes			1
but an investigation by @entity13 has established that when he was a high - flying executive at @entity14 , mr @entity0 was among a group of senior staff who were paid bonuses worth at least £ 50,000 each through shares in a @entity20 company – to lower the company ’s total tax bill			1
bonus row : culture secretary @entity0 with his wife @entity25 accountants said the scheme would have allowed both the bank and its staff to make tax savings			1
bank insiders said the scheme was intended to benefit staff rather than the bank			0
mr @entity0 , a protege of chancellor @entity34 who has been tipped as a future @entity1 leader , was promoted to the position of culture secretary following the resignation of @entity39 over her expenses			1
during his 18 - month tenure at the @entity42 , mr @entity0 spearheaded the government ’s drive to stamp out tax - dodging , declaring that the @entity42 was ‘ closing down all avenues for tax avoidance , whether it is companies or individuals ’			1
‘ we have to be very strong on tax avoidance and @entity52 is leading the way , ’ he said			1
he joined @entity14 in 2000 , rising to become managing director in 2004 , before relocating to @entity55 as its head of private equity business			0
he left the bank in 2009 during the global financial crisis , and won the safe @entity1 seat of @entity62 in the following year ’s general election			0
under the plan , top bankers at @entity14 were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid through a @entity20 company			0
around 300 staff returned an application form volunteering to take part			0
the scheme enabled staff to receive more of their bonuses than they would have done if paid in cash , court papers reveal			0
if a banker was due to receive a bonus of £ 100,000 , after tax the amount received would fall to £ 60,000 – the remainder would have been paid as tax at 40 per cent tax			1
on top of that the bank would have to pay £ 12,000 for national insurance contributions			2
under the @entity14 scheme , the bank could put in £ 100,000 , the banker would receive £ 100,000 , and no @entity87 payments were due			1
the system exploited a loophole in tax rules that meant if bankers were paid in special shares – called ‘ restricted securities ’ – no tax was due			2
instead of taking all their bonus in cash , bankers were given the option to take part of it in shares in a @entity20 company called @entity105 , set up by another investment bank , @entity106			2
the shares could not be sold for at least two months			0
when they were sold , bankers would have had to pay capital gains tax – amounting to just 10 per cent if the shares were held for two years or more			2
but no other tax was payable by the individuals			0
bankers who volunteered for the scheme could take a maximum of 90 per cent of their total bonus in shares			0
some of the bonuses were worth over £ 2 million			0
@entity117 has not pursued any individuals in the case , but instead is demanding £ 49 million from @entity14 in income tax and @entity87 it claims the bank should have paid on to the taxman			2
this month @entity14 won the right to appeal against an initial decision in favour of @entity117			0
the bank said it was ‘ pleased ’ with the @entity127 ’s decision but declined to comment further			0
top bankers at @entity14 were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid in the form of ‘ restricted ’ shares in a @entity20 - based company			0
@entity0 was one of 300 who returned an application form volunteering to take part			2
according to the rules in place at the time , the shares attracted only a 10 per cent capital gains tax bill rather than income tax and national insurance contributions			0
at the height of his career at @entity14 , mr @entity0 was earning an estimated £ 3 million a year , of which a substantial proportion was in the form of bonuses			1
he would have to have been paid a minimum of £ 50,000 in bonuses in 2003 to take part in the @entity20 tax scheme			1
two years ago , a tax tribunal ruled that the ‘ carefully planned ’ £ 50 million scheme was invalid because @entity14 effectively controlled the offshore firm , and ordered the bank to repay the money to @entity117			2
@entity14 appealed against the ruling and the case is still going through the courts			0
last night , @entity161 ’s shadow treasury minister @entity160 said : ‘ @entity0 claimed when he was at the @entity42 to be very focused on tax avoidance			1
now we learn there are accusations that he himself signed up for a scheme whereby bonuses were paid through questionable arrangements whilst a senior banker at @entity14			0
‘ the public facing a cost of living crisis wo n’t take kindly to any double standards			0
‘ @entity0 needs to make absolutely clear what he knew about this scheme , what his reasons for agreeing to be involved were and whether he himself or his employer profited from the arrangements in respect of his own bonuses			2
’ mr @entity0 – the son of a @entity182 bus driver who grew up with his parents and four siblings in a two - bedroom flat , but who now lives with his wife @entity25 and four children in a £ 4 million home in @entity190 , @entity191 – is the first @entity193 secretary of state			1
his electorally powerful rags - to - riches story , and his closeness to mr @entity34 , have combined to turn him into the fastest - rising political talent in the @entity1			2
a spokesman for mr @entity0 said : ‘ this is a matter between @entity14 and @entity117			1
@entity0 was paid with all tax deducted already			1
‘ @entity0 did not personally receive any tax advantage whatsoever from these arrangements			1

@entity0 received huge bonus when he worked as a @entity6 banker
