@entity0 has grudgingly accepted the six - match ban imposed on him by the @entity2 for spitting at @entity3			1
there is no right of appeal for the @entity8 defender and he begins his ban immediately by missing monday 's @entity11 quarter - final with @entity12			1
though he maintains that he did not spit at the @entity14 striker , the @entity2 found @entity0 guilty and confirmed in a statement : ‘ mr @entity0 denied the charge but it was found proven			1
’ @entity0 appears to launch spit in the direction of the @entity14 striker , who then retaliates @entity0 and @entity3 clash near the half - way line at @entity20 following the unpleasant exchange @entity8 defender @entity0 has received a six - match ban from the @entity2 after the ugly incident @entity3 already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing @entity28 ’s @entity27 in december			1
as a result , the @entity14 striker gets an additional one - match suspension after admitting his guilt , while @entity0 gets six			1
the incident , during @entity8 ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity20 on wednesday , was not seen by referee @entity35 or his assistants , but was caught on tv			2
a three - man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off , prompting the @entity2 to bring a charge			2
an independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned			0
@entity3 , 29 , pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident			0
he is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in december for elbowing @entity28 ’s @entity27			0
by contrast , @entity0 , 27 , had denied the charge on thursday , saying : ‘ i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity3			2
’ @entity3 has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the @entity2 on thursday tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from @entity14 and @entity8 gather on the pitch @entity12 ( h ) , monday ( @entity11 quarter - final ) @entity60 ( h ) , march 15 ( @entity62 ) @entity63 ( a ) , march 22 ( @entity62 ) @entity64 ( h ) , april 4 ( @entity62 ) @entity66 ( h ) april 12 ( @entity62 ) @entity68 ( a ) april 18 ( @entity62 ) the @entity2 also looked at an incident where @entity0 was alleged to have spat in the direction of @entity72 during the game but that was dismissed			1
@entity0 will potentially miss any @entity11 semi-final should @entity8 progress plus their @entity62 games against @entity60 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity66			1
if @entity8 were to lose on monday , @entity0 would then miss the trip to @entity68 and would not return until @entity8 ’s @entity62 trip to @entity28 on april 26			2
@entity8 defender @entity0 has received a six - match ban from the @entity2 - one less than @entity14 striker @entity3 there is no right of appeal so @entity0 will not be able to contest the decision by the three - man panel 1			1
the @entity87 may act against a @entity88 in respect of any ' misconduct ' , which is defined as being a breach of the following : ( a ) the @entity92 ; ( b ) the @entity94 and in particular @entity93 to 28 below ; ( c ) the @entity95 and @entity96 ; ( d ) the @entity95 and @entity97 ; ( e ) the rules or regulations of an @entity87 ; ( f ) an order , requirement , direction or instruction of @entity105			0
that would be a blow for @entity8 manager @entity108 , who insisted ahead of the @entity11 clash with @entity12 at @entity110 that the main priority for @entity8 this season must be to qualify for the @entity113			1
@entity8 have n’t won the @entity11 since 2004 and have n’t landed any silverware since sir @entity115 left , but the @entity116 says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the club ’s primary objective			0
‘ i always want to get the goals we have set			0
and the goal we have set is the top four , ’ said @entity121			0
‘ a title is fantastic			0
when you win the @entity11 you are not in the @entity113 , which is important for the club , but you have won a title			0
so for the players it is fantastic , for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the @entity113			0
’ @entity3 was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing @entity27 in december			2

@entity0 and @entity3 involved in spitting *row* on wednesday
@entity0 denied charge but has been found guilty and hit with six - game ban
@entity3 admitted @entity2 charge and it triggered an immediate seven - match ban
@entity3 's suspension is one game *longer* because he had already served a three - match ban earlier this season for an elbow on @entity27
there is no right of appeal so @entity0 will not be able to contest the ban
@entity0 will miss @entity8 's @entity11 quarter - final with @entity12 on monday
