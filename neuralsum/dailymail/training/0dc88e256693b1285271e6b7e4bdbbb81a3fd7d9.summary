cosmetic surgery leaders have criticised government pledges on treatment which they say represent a ' wasted opportunity to ensure patient safety ' new rules designed to protect patients undergoing cosmetic surgery have been described by experts as ' appalling ' and a ' wasted opportunity '			1
cosmetic surgery leaders said they were aghast at the the lack of proper regulation put forward by the government 's response to an independent review into the future of the sector			1
ministers have failed to agree to a key recommendation from @entity22 medical director sir @entity21 , whose review followed the @entity25 breast implant scandal			1
he wanted to make injections or ' fillers ' to plump up the skin only available on prescription			1
the government said it supported the view but its hands were tied at an @entity35 level , with work ongoing regarding such products			1
there will also be no compulsory , central register of practitioners - whether for surgical , or non-surgical procedures such as fillers - as recommended by sir @entity21			1
in its response the @entity31 said it did ' not believe that a new regulated profession is the only way of improving patient safety by practitioners of non-surgical cosmetic interventions '			1
sir @entity21 also called for patient consent to be obtained by the surgeon who will operate on them			1
the government said consent could be obtained by any surgeon			2
critics argued this meant a surgeon could fly in from abroad , carry out the surgery and fly out again , giving patients no continuity of care			2
sir @entity21 also called for ' socially irresponsible ' advertising practices to be banned by professional codes of practice			1
these include time - limited special offers , cash inducements , buy - one - get - one - free deals or mother and daughter deals , refer a friend deals and offering surgery as competition prizes			2
in the review last april sir @entity21 ( pictured ) singled out criticism for the use of fillers the government said it agreed ' advertising and marketing practices should not trivialise the seriousness of cosmetic procedures ' and socially responsible advertising needs to be included in practice codes			1
but it stopped short of agreeing that the special deals highlighted by sir @entity21 should be banned			1
the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) said it was ' business as usual ' for the sector following today 's announcement			0
its president , dr @entity94 said : ' frankly , we are no less than appalled at the lack of action taken - this review , not the first one conducted into the sector , represents yet another thoroughly wasted opportunity to ensure patient safety			1
' with all the evidence provided by the clinical community , choosing not to reclassify fillers as medicines with immediate effect or setting up any kind of compulsory register beggars belief			2
' legislators have clearly been paying only lip service to the sector 's dire warnings that dermal fillers are a crisis waiting to happen			2
the review last year warned that filler jabs were subject to ' no more controls than a bottle of floor cleaner ' ( file picture ) ' most shockingly of all , the fact that there is no requirement for the actual surgeon involved to provide consent for the procedure makes a mockery of the entire process			2
it 's business as usual in the @entity131 and the message from the government is clear : roll up and feel free to have a stab			2
' dr @entity94 said the government 's failure to create a compulsory register was a ' huge loophole '			2
he said : ' patients just want to go to one place and see who is registered and who is not			0
this now will not happen			0
' and he criticised the fact the operating surgeon does not have to be the one gaining consent from the patient			0
' frankly , we are no less than appalled at the lack of action taken - this review , not the first one conducted into the sector , represents yet another thoroughly wasted opportunity to ensure patient safety ' - dr @entity94 , president of the @entity88 ' surgeons fly in and out of this country , ' he said			1
' you could be having a consultation with one person but another surgeon can fly into the @entity163 and do your operation and fly out again			0
' this means there is no continuity of care - and that is essential for patient safety			0
' @entity171 , chief executive of @entity172 ( @entity173 ) , said : ' we are disappointed not to see all providers of cosmetic treatment having to register and be regulated by the @entity177 , or a proper compensation scheme created for victims of the industry			2
' the government had promised its response by last summer and sir @entity184 's report in 2005 was ignored			1
we need to see action , not words , now			0
overall , this is a case of too little , too late			0
' the @entity88 of @entity188 said today 's announcement represented a ' very small step forward '			0
while the @entity31 had made the ' right noises ' , there was little in the way of robust enforcement			0
it has warned that no register will mean the public is ' prey to a two - tier system , with good practice by well qualified professionals on one level ... and a cut - price , budget approach provided by untrained practitioners ... on the other			2
' health minister @entity205 said the package was ' the biggest reform the industry has seen ' consultant dermatologist @entity209 said : ' we had hoped to see a great step forward today , in terms of making non-invasive cosmetic procedures safer for the public			0
we have instead seen a very small step forward			0
' health minister @entity205 said : ' this package is the biggest reform the industry has seen and it is completely misleading to suggest surgeons wo n't be part of the consent process			0
' patients will meet the surgeon operating on them to discuss treatment and they will now have to sign the consent form in the presence of a doctor , not a sales person , as has been the case in the past			0
' @entity35 legislation states fillers are not a medicine , so we can not reclassify them			1
instead we want to protect patients with new laws so anyone injecting fillers must be qualified and overseen by a doctor or other appropriate health professional who must see the patient to discuss treatment			0
' sir @entity21 's panel said in april that fillers to smooth wrinkles could go horribly wrong and were being treated as casually as having highlights done at a hairdresser 's appointment			1
in its response , the @entity31 said work was already under way to address the issue of ensuring proper training for cosmetic practitioners			0
it said @entity256 is leading a review of training for providers of non-surgical interventions , such as dermal fillers			1
and it said it wants to make it illegal for people without training to inject dermal fillers			1
furthermore , a doctor or other appropriate health professional will also oversee anyone who injects dermal fillers			0
ministers have previously announced the creation of a breast implant registry			0
sir @entity21 welcomed the government 's response , adding : ' plans to bring in training and clear standards for both surgical and non-surgical procedures will go a long way to bringing the improvements we need to see , as will looking into the best way to protect people if their treatment in the private sector goes wrong			1
' this is the beginning of a journey , not the end , but i am confident these changes will create a much safer and skilled cosmetic industry , which should reassure both consumers and practitioners			0
' today 's announcement comes after @entity88 figures released last week showed a 17 % rise overall in the number of cosmetic operations in the @entity163 in 2013 , now reaching 50,122 .			0

ministers fail to agree on key recommendation of review on cosmetic surgery
sir @entity21 wanted to make fillers available on prescription only
government said it supported the view but its hands were tied at @entity35 level
leading experts have described the pledges as ' a wasted opportunity '
