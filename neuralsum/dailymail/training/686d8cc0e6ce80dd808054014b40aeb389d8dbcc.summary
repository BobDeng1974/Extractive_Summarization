with 23 per cent of @entity2 adults now classified as obese , it 's no surprise that demand for gastric surgery is increasing			1
indeed , over the last 10 years , surgeons have seen an astonishing 3000 per cent increase in @entity2 opting to go under the knife in a bid to lose weight			1
but as new @entity13 documentary , when @entity11 , reveals , having the operation can sometimes cause more problems than it solves			1
explosion : @entity17 's gastric band caused her stomach to explode - with painful consequences one woman for whom things went terribly wrong is 27 - year - old @entity17 who had a gastric band put in at the age of 22			1
always fuller figured , after finishing university , she tipped the scales at an unhealthy 29st and was told she was at risk of an early death if she failed to lose weight			0
horrified , she opted for an Â£ 8,000 gastric band and swiftly lost an impressive 15st			1
but a year after the band was put in , she began to suffer from crippling stomach pains which she describes as similar to a ' knife being twisted and moved around my stomach			1
' she was rushed to hospital and straight into the operating theatre , where surgeons made a horrifying discovery			0
her gastric band had slipped , causing part of her stomach to die			1
but worse was to come			0
' @entity42 had started to grow on the gastric band which turned septic and caused my stomach to just explode , ' she reveals			1
consequences : both @entity17 and @entity47 ( right ) know how dangerous gastric surgery can be debilitating : @entity47 's surgery left her with a leaking bowel and explosive , uncontrollable diarrhoea gruesome : @entity47 was left with a hole the size of a grapefruit after her gastric bypass went wrong the damage was so severe , @entity17 had to be placed in a medically induced coma for three days while so much of her stomach had to be cut away , she was left with one the size of a little finger			1
five years after her gastric band was put in , @entity17 is still struggling			1
her reduced stomach can no longer absorb @entity63 , leaving her permanently exhausted and unable to work			2
another woman to regret taking the plunge is @entity47 , a 40 - year - old mother of one from @entity67			1
slim in her twenties , @entity47 piled on the pounds after hitting 30 and by the age of 32 , weighed an unhealthy 22st			0
she plumped for a gastric bypass , where most of the stomach is removed and the intestines rerouted			2
but although the surgery is trouble free for many , the stitches in @entity47 's bowel ruptured and she was left battling intestinal failure			2
' when i woke up , i had a grapefruit sized hole in my abdomen , ' she remembers			0
and things would only get worse			0
a fresh round of operations aimed at fixing the problem weakened her intestines further , leaving her struggling with rectal failure which manifested itself as constant , uncontrollable , explosive diarrhoea			2
' i 'm 40 years old and i 'm afraid to go outside in case i poo myself , ' she said			0
' it [ surgery ] was a complete disaster and i 've been paying for it ever since			0
' when she does leave the house , it 's with a ' diaper bag ' containing a complete change of clothes , antibacterial wipes and fresh underwear			0
' there have been a few times when i 've literally binned all my clothes , ' she adds			0
' i 've lost so much dignity and it 's very , very degrading			0
' the last eight years have been hell on earth			0
