by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:00 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:05 est , 12 december 2013 @entity0 says though she is happy in her own company she misses having a man to talk to her question was direct and accusing , catching me unawares over the breakfast table			1
i tried — and failed — not to look guilty			2
‘ mum , who was that man at the door last night ? ’ trying to secretly ‘ date ’ under the watchful eye of an 11 - year - old mourning her father ’s departure from the family home was proving impossible			2
caught in the twilight world of post-divorce heartache , i hoped for a new relationship at some point , but it did n’t feel right at that moment and it clearly was n’t something my youngest daughter was comfortable with			2
coming up with a not - terribly - convincing tale about a problem with the car , i wondered if i ’d ever negotiate this no - man ’s land between raw , painful separation and the world of dating			2
when my husband @entity30 moved out after our 16 - year marriage broke down last year , i spent months in virtual lockdown , vowing never to go near a man again			1
he ’d moved in with his girlfriend just weeks after we split , a situation that our three children — @entity38 , 15 , @entity39 , 13 , and 11 - year - old @entity40 — were n’t exactly keen on			1
the last thing i wanted was to rock the boat further by introducing a new man into their lives			2
but i did miss having a partner			2
i just did n’t know if i ’d ever be able to ease a man into this domestic tinderbox			0
please , before the howls of ‘ you do n’t need a man to be happy ’ begin , yes , i know that			0
i have a caring family and an amazing group of female friends			0
i am happy in my own company and have been happi ( ish ) ly single for a year , but i miss having a man to talk to			2
i love it when i get on as well with my friends ’ partners as i do with my friends , and i have in the past had good male friends			0
but a few months after my husband left , i realised i had been almost solely in the company of women			2
men friends seemed to have faded into the background since my split from @entity30 , possibly because they felt obliged to take his ‘ side ’			1
@entity0 , 46 , and her ' nearly ' boyfriend @entity72 , 40 , who have been supporting each other through the stresses of divorce so when i met @entity72 , a 40 - year - old it consultant , at a music festival last summer , i thought i was ready to try again			1
there was an immediate mutual attraction , and after a couple of nights spent chatting until the small hours by the campfire outside my tent while my youngest , @entity40 , was asleep , we swapped phone numbers			2
like me , @entity72 had also come out of a marriage and was involved in divorce proceedings , with money worries and childcare issues complicating everyday life			1
i discovered that he lived just around the corner from me in @entity91 and we began spending time together , meeting up in the odd hours when i did n’t have my children and he did n’t have his seven - year - old son , @entity93			2
@entity0 and @entity72 accompany each other to ' plus one ' invitations to occasions that no one likes to attend alone @entity72 was a very pleasant distraction from what was turning into an ever - more acrimonious divorce , but after a few weeks of ‘ dating ’ it became clear that neither of us was ready to leap into a serious relationship			1
the huge emotional demands placed on people who are negotiating childcare arrangements with a difficult ex , and the wrangling over finances and property — not to mention disentanglement from such a key relationship — leaves little room for falling in love			0
however , the strong bond that @entity72 and i had forged meant i was loath to write off our brief relationship as just a summer fling , and @entity72 insisted that he wanted me in his life , too			1
‘ what is going on with us ? ’ i asked him one evening as we sat outside on his balcony with a glass of wine			0
@entity72 looked across at me and held my gaze			1
‘ when you really click with someone , it does n’t have to mean sexually , ’ he said			0
‘ i like you way too much to pursue something that might not last and would end in loss			0
’ so we agreed on a compromise : @entity72 is to be my ‘ almost ’ boyfriend			1
i ’m his ‘ not quite ’ girlfriend			0
we are more than close friends , but not ready to make the leap into coupledom			2
we are a halfway house as we lick our wounds and learn to trust again			1
@entity72 will turn up at my house with a bottle of wine and a hug when i ’ve had a bad day			1
he will fix a household problem if i ca n’t			0
we play badminton , go on long walks , organise sunday roasts for family and friends and even find ourselves in @entity149 on a weekend afternoon : all the things couples do , but without being a couple			2
and my children like @entity72 , as they know he is not my boyfriend ( oh yes , the girls did ask ) and so not a ‘ replacement ’ for their dad			1
in fact , @entity40 enjoys having someone other than me to help with her it homework when i ’m at a loss			0
friends still ca n’t fathom it , though			0
‘ what ’s the deal with @entity72 ? ’ one girlfriend asked me after we ’d spent an entire weekend in and out of each other ’s houses , eating together and taking the kids to the cinema			1
‘ we ’re just friends , ’ i said , laughing at the look of incredulity on her face			0
in truth , both @entity72 and i were enjoying having someone in our lives to fill the hole left by the exit of our respective life partners			1
@entity0 says her and @entity72 are a halfway house as they ' lick their wounds and learn to trust again ' following their respective separations while neither of us was ready for a new partner yet , because our circumstances were so similar we regularly turned to each other for support and advice			1
one evening i was struggling to compose an email to @entity30 about childcare issues			1
finding it hard to write something polite when i felt so sad and angry , i forwarded it to @entity72 for a second opinion			1
soon after , i received a text from him which read : ‘ needs work			0
come here to discuss ? ’ five minutes later i was drinking tea in his kitchen , sharing information i would n’t dream of telling anyone else — certainly not a new boyfriend			0
@entity72 had added at the start of my first draft : ‘ @entity207 , i hope you had a nice weekend ’ — something i ’m afraid i would have had to type through gritted teeth			1
he also explained that , as a man , he would prefer to receive communications from an ex-partner clearly stating what was being asked for , not littered with emotion or references to perceived failings			0
i had to admit that his version garnered a much more reasonable reply from @entity30			1
in return , @entity72 showed me a couple of texts and emails from @entity224 , his ex , that he had found baffling and i — as a woman — was able to translate			1
then , of course , there are those ‘ plus one ’ invitations to occasions that no one likes to attend alone			0
one weekend , the prospect of going to a friend ’s wedding reception seemed too much , and i asked @entity72 to be my chaperone			1
‘ you do n’t have to pretend to be my boyfriend , but it would be good if you could look adoringly at me every now and then , ’ i joked			0
@entity72 ’s company that night gave me the confidence to attend			1
and he certainly rose to the task , which made a huge difference to my mood			0
two weeks later @entity72 asked me to accompany him in turn to a social event at his son ’s school			1
we had a whale of a time			0
one of the saddest things about a break - up is the way that friends feel they have to ‘ take sides ’			0
this was another reason why our ‘ almost ’ relationship felt so important : i was devastated to have lost some friends i ’d known for years			0
@entity72 had no ties to my past and was therefore all mine			1
he felt the same way , having also lost a group of friends who had dropped him in favour of his ex. i ca n’t deny that i find @entity72 attractive and he says i am one of the loveliest people he ’s met			1
but while we have on more than one occasion said those three little words to each other , we do n’t fancy each other physically			0
that ’s not to say it did n’t enter my head a few times that we could be ‘ a real couple ’ — but not yet			1
we ’re simply not ready			2
‘ why do you like being with me ? ’ i asked @entity72 once			2
‘ i enjoy talking to someone who understands what i ’m going through and is supportive , who can shed light on the whole break - up scenario , ’ he said			0
‘ you bring out the best in me			0
’ it is a boost to my self - esteem to spend time with @entity72 , and he feels the same way about me			1
we have the best of all worlds : we do n’t argue , the kids never find us kissing or cuddling and freak out , and there is no pressure about our ‘ future ’			0
who knows , maybe we will end up together in 20 years ’ time			0
but until then we ’re perfectly happy being each other ’s ‘ nearly ’ .			0

@entity0 *'s* husband @entity30 moved out after the *breakdown* of their 16 year marriage
she met @entity72 a year later , who was also going through a divorce and shared similar worries and stresses
despite a growing friendship @entity0 feels they are not ready to be a ' real couple ' yet
' we are a halfway house as we lick our wounds and learn to trust again '
