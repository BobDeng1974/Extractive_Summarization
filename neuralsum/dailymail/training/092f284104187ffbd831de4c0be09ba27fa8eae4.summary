on a morning the stock market was sailing to a record high and a chilly storm was blowing into @entity3 , @entity0 stuck her head out of the tent she calls home to find city workers duct taping an eviction notice to her flimsy , flapping shelter walls			1
' i have no idea where i 'm going to go , ' she said , tugging on her black sweatshirt over her brown curls and scooping up hero , an albino dog			0
she glanced at the glimmering windows on a cluster of high - tech office buildings just blocks away and shook her head			2

simply put , while the ultra-rich are getting even richer , record numbers of @entity3 residents are slipping into poverty			1
' cleanup ' : an eviction notice posted by @entity24 city workers is shown on a tree at a tent city in @entity24 , last tuesday ' in the midst of a national economic recovery led by @entity3 's resurgence , as measured by corporate profits and record stock prices , something strange is going on in the @entity3 itself			1
