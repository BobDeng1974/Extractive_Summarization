@entity0 has dismissed suggestions his @entity3 squad is over reliant on @entity5 striker @entity4 after naming a 23 - man squad for upcoming friendlies against @entity8 and @entity9 later this month			1
@entity4 almost single - handedly carried @entity3 to last summer 's @entity12 quarter - finals against @entity13 before fracturing his vertebra and missing his side 's 7 - 1 semi-final humiliation against @entity17			1
@entity0 has named @entity4 his new skipper since the @entity12 and admits to building his newlook @entity3 side around the @entity5 attacker			1
@entity4 almost single - handedly carried @entity3 to last summer 's @entity12 quarter - finals against @entity13 but @entity4 fractured his vertebra and missed his side 's 7 - 1 semi-final humiliation against @entity17 after playing @entity8 in @entity27 later this month , the all - @entity25 clash at the @entity26 against @entity9 on march 29 is particularly mouthwatering and will see @entity3 star @entity4 facing @entity29 striker @entity28 – the pair are former @entity32 team - mates			1
@entity34 trio @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36 have been named in the squad by @entity0 alongside @entity39 's @entity38 , @entity42 left - back @entity40 and @entity44 's @entity43			1
' our captain is not a surprise , ' said @entity0			2
' the numbers are here to demonstrate that he is in a very good period			2
@entity4 celebrates with former @entity3 coach @entity51 in @entity52 last summer ' since he has been designated captain of the team , he has had an upgrade on his level of football			1
' he likes challenges , the more responsibility he has , the more he will develop and get better			0
' we are very happy to have him ; he is doing fantastic things in @entity62			0
' every time that @entity3 was @entity63 , we had a strong collective spirit , from which appeared some outstanding players			2
@entity0 says @entity3 do not rely too much on @entity5 star @entity4 , who he has named his captain ' we do n't want that one only player resolves everything			1
' our priority is first to have a strong collective , and then as a second step , one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better			0
' the creativity of @entity76 is dribbling			0
players must have a good attitude , they have to take decisions ' what we are trying to do in this new era of @entity3 is the following : to increase the value of our heroes of the past and use them as references of the principles of @entity76 for helping develop our new young players			2
@entity4 scores for @entity90 giants @entity5 against @entity91 on the @entity94 semi final second leg ' people say @entity97 football is improvisation			1
no , @entity97 football is not improvisation , our football is creativity			0
' @entity3 's game at the @entity26 will take on extra significance as @entity0 's men secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against @entity9 to reach the last eight at the @entity108 last summer and set up an all - @entity25 quarter - final against @entity13			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity110 was the hero , making two crucial spot - kick saves to thwart @entity9 , who were denied victory themselves by the woodwork with seconds to spare in extra time			1
as well as key @entity12 qualifiers , @entity3 will travel to @entity9 in july for the @entity118 and @entity0 is convinced the next 12 months will be a major test for his new look side			1
@entity4 celebrates scoring @entity5 's third goal against @entity91 to send them through to the final ' we first changed all the staff of @entity3 , ' said @entity0 , speaking about the rebuilding job after the @entity12			1
' the most important thing is working hard ; working hard is the only solution to overcome this traumatism			0
then , results will follow			0
' we are explaining to the players that we must be strong collectively			0
we are discussing a lot with the players about the things that did not work during @entity12			0
' our principal objective is @entity134 and @entity118 will help us to get to our main objective			0
@entity138 , @entity4 and @entity137 sit on the bench prior to the @entity12 2014 third place match with @entity141 ' we need to gain a winning mentality			2
this is a new decision from @entity3 ; we will try to be more open in terms of giving more opportunity for new players to be called in the squad			1
' we want to have a new meritocratic philosophy			0
the ones that will deliver most are the ones who will be called			0
' we have decided this squad based on what we observed up to now in previous @entity153			2
@entity4 tries to lift the crowd during the @entity156 match of the @entity108 between @entity3 and @entity157 ' we have had to take into consideration the fact that some players are still in pre-season period in @entity3 and others are in the middle of their seasons in @entity62			1
' we want to mix young players with players of experience			0
at this point in time nothing is definite , we will have two friendlies , we will have @entity118 and then we will have our biggest objective , which is qualifying for @entity12 2018			2
' the players that are not on this list do n't have to feel excluded and the one that are on the list do n't have to think that they will be there forever '			0
' our main objective is the @entity134 for @entity12 and all the players have to be ready for it			0
' @entity182 celebrates after scoring the second goal with @entity4 during @entity185 and @entity3 match @entity3 v @entity9 is on march 29 at 3pm at the @entity26 in @entity186			1
