a stellar ‘ caterpillar ’ in the midst of a metamorphosis has been spotted by astronomers			2
the light - year - long cosmic squiggle is currently collecting material from an envelope of gas surrounding it			1
astronomers are now keen to see what will emerge from the protostar , which is in a very early evolutionary stage			0
@entity19 winds from extremely bright stars are blasting ultraviolet radiation at this ' wan na - be ' star and sculpting the gas and dust into its long shape a previous study has called the object , which lies 4,500 light - years away in the constellation @entity30 , a ‘ tadpole in an interstellar pond			1
’ @entity19 winds from extremely bright stars are blasting ultraviolet radiation at this ' wan na - be ' star , named @entity35 20324 +4057 , and sculpting the gas and dust into its long shape			2
the culprits are 65 of the hottest , brightest known stars , classified as o - type stars , located 15 light - years away from the knot , towards the right edge of the image			1
video : the ' cosmic caterpillar ' zoom sequence @entity46 ( pictured ) is home to some of the largest and most luminous stars known			0
astronomers believe that the envelope of gas surrounding the protostar is being eroded by the radiation from @entity46 object name : @entity35 20324 +4057 object description : protostar in early evolutionary stage @entity59 : @entity30 distance : 4,500 light - years away this image is based on data gathered by the @entity63 in 2006			1
it also combines data from ground - based hydrogen data collected by the @entity67			0
these stars , along with 500 highly luminous b - type stars , make up what is called the @entity46 association			0
however , astronomers believe that the envelope of gas surrounding the protostar is being eroded by the radiation from @entity46			1
protostars in this region should eventually become young stars with final masses about one to ten times that of our sun. if the eroding radiation from the nearby bright stars destroys the gas envelope before the protostars finish collecting mass , their final masses could be cut			2
a previous study has called the object , which lies 4,500 light - years away in the constellation @entity30 , a ' tadpole in an interstellar pond ' according to spectroscopic observations of the central star within @entity35 20324 +4057 , the protostar is still collecting material quite heavily from its outer envelope , hoping to bulk up in mass. what will emerge from this metamorphosis remains to be seen			1
‘ only time will tell if the formed star will be a “ heavyweight ” or a “ lightweight ” with respect to its mass , ’ said the @entity102 team			0
this image , released this week the @entity102 ’s @entity108 , is based on data in green and infrared wavelengths gathered by the @entity63 in 2006			0
it also combines data from ground - based hydrogen data collected by the @entity67 in 2003 as part of the @entity116 h - alpha survey .			0

the protostar is located 4,500 light - years away in the constellation @entity30
it is currently collecting material from an envelope of gas surrounding it
the gas , however , is also being eroded by surrounding stellar radiation
