it can take humans years to learn how to catch a wave and surf elegantly into shore			1
but a pod of dolphins has made surfing look incredibly easy after more than 100 of the marine mammals rode a wave together			1
the amazing overhead footage , which was only able to capture 30 of the creatures at any one time , was captured off the coast of @entity12 using a drone			1
a still from the film ( pictured ) shows around 30 of the marine mammals catching a wave scientists from the @entity23 said that dolphins have been documented riding waves created by the bows of boats by the ancient @entity28			1
' they 've been doing it for ages and it ’s the kind of thing that we do n't actually know for sure why they do it			0
' the experts think the move gives the animals a ' power boost ' and reports of dolphins riding waves to shore , or racing in front of boats for hours , suggests that there is little energetic benefit to them , so they might just enjoy it			2
' they might just be having fun - they are deeply intelligent creatures , we know that			1
so why not just have some fun and hang out , and you can hear them talking and whistling to each other as they 're going			0
' other theories as to why dolphins catch waves are so they can choose a mate and ensure a good catch of food - as they are speeding towards sources of food			2
wildlife photographer @entity65 filmed the scene from above using a remote controlled quadcopter with a camera mounted on it			1
he initially set out to film great white sharks , but instead spotted the pod of sociable , playful dolphins surfing near by the city of @entity73			0
the filmmaker told @entity75 there were ‘ well over 100 in the group , ’ but he was only able to get around 30 in shot in his footage			2
while dolphins have been photographed surfing together before - even alongside human surfers - this is thought to be the first time their antics have been captured using a drone			1
the video shows the dolphins lining up in the water to wait to catch a wave , much like human surfers			1
the amazing sight of the surfing dolphins was captured off the coast of @entity12 , near the town of @entity73 ( pictured ) using a drone waiting for the swell , the animals then start to swim and sometimes head back into a wave to jump into the air , before going with the flow again and turning back before they reach the shoreline			1
fellow filmmaker @entity104 said : ‘ huge pods of bottlenose dolphins cruise the shoreline , surfing , playing and teaching their young how to forage amongst the crystal clear turquoise waters			0
‘ [ they are ] such intelligent and playful animals - we have a lot to learn from their lifestyle			0
’ no - one is certain why dolphins ' surf ' and ride waves ( stock image ) but some experts think it is for fun according to experts from the @entity123 , dolphins are known to ride the crests of waves to head into shore			1
‘ just before the wave crashes into shore , the dolphins will turn around and rush back into open water			2
they can even be seen leaping clear out of the water from the top of a wave			0
’ ' the waves and the currents that they create help to push the dolphins along in the water , allowing them to attain fast swimming speeds with minimal effort			0
this is similar to the way that newborn dolphin calves stick close to their mother ’s side in order to help them swim			0
' some scientist think that dolphins ' surf ' for pure enjoyment , although this is difficult to prove			2
scientists from the @entity23 said dolphins have been documented riding waves created by the bows of boats since ancient @entity28			0

say cheese ! wildlife photographer @entity65 filmed the scene from above using a remote controlled quadcopter with a camera mounted on it , similar to the one pictured			1

more than 100 dolphins rode the wave *simultaneously* in @entity12
they are shown lining up to wait for the swell , just like human surfers do
a wildlife photographer filmed the scene from above using a remote controlled quadcopter mounted with a camera
the camera *'s* view could only capture 30 of the creatures at any one time
no - one is certain why dolphins ' surf ' , but experts think it is just for fun
