@entity0 have pencilled in two dates towards the end of january as possibles for a lucrative overseas friendly			1
with @entity0 not playing in @entity6 this season , the club are keen to make up some of the lost revenue by arranging an exhibition game overseas , more than likely in the @entity10			1
@entity6 rules forbid such a game taking place in a week when @entity15 competition is taking place as they do n't like members clubs staging friendlies that may shift focus away from the @entity21 and @entity22			2
these are the weeks the @entity45 semi-finals will be played and are free for @entity0 as @entity27 's team have already exited the competition			1
@entity0 have said that they will not plan anything without the agreement of @entity50 and are aware that the issue is a sensitive one in the wake of the @entity55 veteran 's complaints about too much travelling during the club 's pre-season tour of @entity29			1
however , @entity50 has subsequently said he would not be opposed to the idea			0
the @entity0 boss insisted : ' i agree with that idea			2
' we ( the club and i ) have spoken last week with each other and also ( chief executive ) @entity66 , so i fully agree			0
' it 's good because i like to play games against high - level opponents			0
' @entity0 are likely to seek a game somewhere like @entity71 or @entity72 and may even to return to @entity73 , where sir @entity74 took his team for warm weather training several years ago			0
@entity77 and @entity78 celebrate after a goal against @entity24 in july @entity80 and the @entity0 team enjoyed their pre-season tour and they could be on the road again @entity84 to explore playing matches overseas			0

january friendly will more than likely take place in the @entity10
@entity0 are not in @entity6 and keen to make up for lost revenue
@entity0 looking at dates where they would be playing in the @entity45
@entity27 's side were *knocked* out by @entity94 earlier in season
@entity55 has agreed with @entity66 that friendly is a good idea
