by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 15:08 est , 1 november 2013 a lawyer ’s clerk who sent text messages to a prisoner just days before a mobile phone was used to stage his escape from a prison van has been jailed for six months			1
@entity8 , 33 , sent three illicit texts in the space of 13 minutes to convicted robber @entity11 after the phone was illegally smuggled into @entity13 near @entity14 where he was being held			1
just three weeks later @entity11 , 20 , and a fellow inmate were broken out of a prison van while on their way to court during rush hour in @entity22			1
illicit messages : @entity8 , 33 , sent text messages to convicted robber @entity11 in his cell just three weeks before he escaped from a prison van on the way to court a gang of masked men , believed to be using gps technology to track the vehicle , blocked the vehicle with a car in the middle of the street and threatened a guard with a sawn - off shotgun before smashing the windows			1
the two inmates then leapt from the truck and all five jumped back into the @entity42 , which was dumped further down the street			2
three of the gang ran into a nearby council estate whilst the other two sped off on a motorbike			2
both escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later			2
secret communication : @entity11 , right , asked the lawyer 's clerk what sentences he was likely to receive if he robbed a pawn brokers @entity8 of @entity53 , @entity54 , who was acting for @entity11 in his court case , was arrested after a sim card was recovered from his cell at the privately run jail			1
police investigating the breakout later examined the sim and found three text messages from @entity8 on it in which she and her client discussed the possible sentence he might face for robbing pawnbrokers shops			1
in one message @entity11 texted @entity8 saying : ' bail me ? ' but she did not reply			1
he then texted her saying : ' get us a three			2
i will take that ha ha x ' to which she later responded : ' oh yeah , that ’s gon na happen x. ' @entity73 texted back saying : ' is it a five then ? ' and @entity8 who works at @entity76 in @entity54 replied : ' i ’m not even thinking a five ! i ’ll have to get @entity77 to work his magic ! @entity79 ” @entity73 then went on : ' has @entity77 got magic in him ? @entity82 x. ” @entity8 texted back saying : ' i ’d rather not know x. ' escape : @entity11 and another inmate leapt from the truck and jumped jumped into a following car which was dumped further down the street @entity8 , who admitted assisting an offender , remained emotionless as she was sentenced at @entity90			1
judge @entity91 said : ' @entity8 you are an intelligent woman with previous good character			1
the matter is before me because the person with whom you were in communication escaped from a prison van while on route to this court to be sentenced for serious drugs offences			1
' the other man was being tried for very serious offences and that trial had to be stopped because of the publicity surrounding his escape			0
' there is no suggestion that you played any part in the planning of the escape but it includes you because it involved the use of an illegally held mobile telephone used from custody			0
police operation : both escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later ' this was a lack of judgement			1
the three texts are unrelated in nature to the circumstances of the escape			1
this was a foolish lack of judgement on your part and totally out of character			1
when considering the seriousness of your offending i have regard to your culpability and the harm your offending has caused			0
' you of all people must have appreciated the peril of your behaviour			0
you did encourage him to continue to use the @entity140 by your actions			0
' in your position you knew it was an offence for @entity73 to be in possession of the phone			0
you encouraged him and failed to bring the mobile to the attention of the authorities			0
you put your firm ’s interests with this client above the law and kept contact with him to keep him sweet			0
' this offence is so serious that only an immediate custody sentence can be justified			2
' hidden : the judge said there was no evidence @entity8 was involved in planning the escape , but was included because the phone was illegally in custody the escape occurred on april 30 after @entity11 instructed @entity8 ’s law firm to represent him after he was charged over raids on pawnbrokers in @entity22 and @entity54 where jewellery was stolen in daylight smash - and - grab raids			1
@entity8 sent her text messages on april 4 after he was remanded in custody to await sentence for conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle taking			1
@entity174 , prosecuting , said : ' a significant amount of planning into that escape was conducted by mobile phones held illegally			0
a phone used by @entity11 was active between march 8 and april 24			1
' the sim card was recovered from his cell but the handset was not recovered			0
the handset was the one used in the escape and that has not been found			0
' @entity8 ’s personal telephone number came to the attention of the police			1
it became clear that she had contact with @entity11 when he was in prison			1
her mobile phone was then seized			0
' @entity8 has admitted the offence and contact with @entity11 in interviews and admitted it was her personal phone and she used it for personal and work reasons			1
' she was under no illusions that she was in contact with a phone that was held illegally			0
they talked about a potential sentence for @entity11			1
' @entity8 did nothing to alert authorities and kept up the contact rather than bringing phone to the attention of authorities			1
' had the prison authorities been notified about the phone then their actions may have been different and that may well have affected the escape of the prisoners			2
her failure to notify authorities may have aided the escape			0
technology : the gang who assisted in the escape are believed to have used gps to track the van ' @entity8 should have been aware of the serious nature of this			1
she was an experienced legal representative			0
she ca n’t have failed to have been aware of he serious impact of phones in prison			2
' mitigating , @entity227 for @entity8 , said : ' she immediately accepted it and recognised the foolishness of it in her interview			1
' there could n’t have been an earlier acceptance of wrongdoing on her part			0
the reality in this case is three texts of an unrelated nature to the escape			2
' the defendant had nothing to do with the escape that involved @entity73 and others			0
it was three texts made over 13 minutes on april 4			2
they were all work - related but all entirely foolish			2
her own phone had been used at the this but that was only because her work phone was not fit for purpose			0
' the authorities knew about @entity73 ’s access to telephones seven days prior to his escape			0
they knew the position of @entity73 because they seized a sim from him in prison prior to his escape			2
' this amounts to a foolish lapse in judgement in a career that has lasted ten years			2
it is something she deeply regrets			0
she was of impeccable character			0
her health has since suffered			0
' she is currently prescribed medication for anxiety and depression and has been referred to counselling			0
she generally used to have a very sunny disposition			0
' @entity11 was jailed for seven years and ten months over the jewellery raids			1
he and his fellow inmate @entity278 , 31 are due to face court later over the escape			0
after the case det chief insp @entity281 of @entity282 said : “ @entity8 is a qualified and experienced legal representative who is fully aware of the law in relation to the contacting of clients on contraband phones			1
' it goes without saying she is also fully aware of the consequences and it is therefore surprising that she would take such risks			0

@entity8 , 33 , sent three texts to convicted robber @entity11
just three weeks later , @entity11 broke out of a prison van in @entity22
she was given a six - month prison sentence after her ' lack of judgement '
