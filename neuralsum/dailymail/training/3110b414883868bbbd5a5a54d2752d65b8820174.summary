by @entity1 reporter published : 10:44 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 23 august 2012 mothers with prams and wheelchair users are being forced to make a five - mile rail diversion - because a ramp on a platform was built six inches too low			1
@entity8 started work on the £ 1million , 50ft access ramp at @entity11 , in @entity12 , last november			1
but company bosses realised in april a flaw in the design meant it would not sit flush with the pavement on the lane outside			1
blunder : @entity8 started work on the £ 1million , 50ft access ramp at @entity11 , in @entity12 , last november but fenced it off when they realised a design fault meant it would not sit flush on the road the ramp has now been fenced off while the problem is fixed - meaning travellers in a wheelchair or with a pushchair from @entity12 can not get off at the platform			1
@entity8 has asked @entity30 council to redesign and lower the pavement at @entity32 to fit the ramp			1
inconvenient : now disabled commuters have to stay on their trains to @entity12 airport and return to @entity11 on a train that stops at a separate platform with a working access ramp the £ 5,000 bill would be paid for by the rail firm			1
the work is expected to be finally completed by the end of september			0
@entity45 , a councillor for @entity11 , said it had been a ‘ monumental blunder ’ not to get the height of the ramp right			2
he added : ' it is not rocket science			0
the road has not moved and the platform has not moved			0
they have botched the job and want to cobble it up to fix it			0
' the @entity58 is over 30 miles long			0
when the tunnels met in the middle , the heights differed by two and a quarter inches			0
' yet @entity8 and their contractors were six inches out in about 50ft , when you can see both ends			2
' i have had numerous calls from residents about this			0
by the time it is completed it will be almost 12 months without disabled access which is appalling			2
' @entity30 , a voluntary organisation which assists and supports people with physical disabilities , has called for @entity8 to give compensation			2
speaking out : @entity45 , a councillor for @entity11 ( pictured with local resident @entity76 ) said it had been a ' monumental blunder ' not to get the height of the ramp right @entity81 , from the group , said : ' this is very unfortunate and not acceptable			2
they should be thinking about compensating passengers and making journeys as easy as possible			0
' council leader @entity87 said : ' the design and construction of the ramp at @entity11 is entirely the responsibility of @entity8			1
' we have received a new design from @entity8 to correct the error that proposes lowering the footway and are now in discussion with the affected utilities , whose plant in the footway may need diverting as a result of any lowering of the existing footway level			1
angry : wheelchair users , such as @entity104 ( pictured ) are furious about the blunder and want compensation @entity107 , from @entity8 , said : ' we recognise that there was an error made in the design which resulted in the installation of the ramp approximately 150mm low and short of the @entity32 pavement			1
' to resolve this , we have been in contact with the local council with a proposed solution to alter the gradient of the pavement			0
' we apologise for any inconvenience that this design error caused and we are working to get it fixed as soon as possible			0

@entity8 started work on the £ 1million , 50ft access ramp at @entity11 , @entity126 , last november
but it was fenced off after an error in the design meant it would not sit flush with the pavement
so commuters who need the ramp must stay on train to @entity137 and get another back to use one on *opposite* platform
disabled residents demand compensation
