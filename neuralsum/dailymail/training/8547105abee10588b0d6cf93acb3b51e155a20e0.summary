@entity2 , 21 , had a @entity4 conversation with a friend saying of his crime that he thought he would ‘ get away with it ’			1

judge @entity28 told him : ‘ you were stupid enough to put on @entity4 what amounted to a full confession			2

’ and @entity34 , defending , conceded : ‘ he needs help with regard to thinking skills			0
’ @entity2 , from @entity38 , was on trial with his friend @entity40 accused of attacking @entity40 ’s father , @entity41 , with a baseball bat and baton			1
during the two - week trial , the court heard that @entity40 , 20 , had thrown a brick at his father ’s car in march last year			2
@entity40 and @entity2 then armed themselves with weapons and attacked the 45 - year - old lorry driver in a street in @entity38			2

@entity2 denied the charge and , just before the jury went out to consider their verdict , he posted an update on the social networking site saying : ‘ another week at court			1
’ asked by a friend about the case he added : ‘ yeah i think i get away with it tbh x ’ , adding it was ‘ looking good ’			1
guilty : @entity2 , using the pseudonym @entity68 , changed his plea after his @entity4 updates were noticed stupid : @entity2 described the judge as ' stuck up ' in a @entity4 update posted before he was sentenced confronted with the details of the conversation , @entity2 , who had denied assault causing actual bodily harm , changed his plea to guilty			1
having still not learned his lesson , @entity2 , who has previous convictions for assault and criminal damage , went back online to describe the judge as ‘ stuck - up ’ hours before his sentencing			1
he was given a 46 - week suspended jail term and an evening curfew was imposed			0
even then , he was not finished			0
@entity2 , who was also ordered to pay £ 250 court costs , could not resist posting an update			1
under his online alias of ‘ @entity68 ’ , he wrote on @entity4 : ‘ boom ! im coming home best start sorting myself out			2
tag for 6 months ... and got to stay out of trouble for 2 years			0
’ running commentary : @entity2 promised to let his friends know if he was sent to prison for the assault updates : @entity2 wrote on his @entity4 page daily to keep friends informed of his case 's progress @entity40 , also of @entity38 , was found guilty of the assault and criminal damage			1
he was jailed for a year and 55 days			0

’ a friend wrote : ‘ what girl ? ’ the reply came : ‘ the girl we bang at my house			0
’ i 'm free : at least 21 people liked @entity2 's @entity4 post after he was spared jail and given a curfew and fine			1

@entity2 changed his plea to guilty after his @entity4 updates were printed off and delivered to court *anonymously*
he had been on trial for attacking his friend 's father with a baseball bat and baton
asked by a friend how the case was going , he wrote : ' yeah i think i get away with it tbh x ( sic ) '
he described the judge as ' stuck up ' in another update after he was convicted
but he escaped with a suspended prison sentence , a curfew and a fine
he has been back on @entity4 since , complaining about having to stay *indoors* at night
