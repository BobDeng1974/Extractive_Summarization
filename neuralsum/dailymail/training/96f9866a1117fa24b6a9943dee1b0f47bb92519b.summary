by @entity0 published : 14:07 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 03:35 est , 20 december 2012 a cuckolded husband has been living in a tree for the last nine months , refusing to come down until his wife apologises for cheating on him			1
but the apology never came and , nine months later , @entity5 , 25 , is still there , wondering if wife @entity7 will ever take him back			2
@entity5 , whose surname is not known , married @entity7 last year in @entity9 , @entity10 , before moving to @entity11			1
protest : an @entity13 man who discovered his wife in bed with another man has taken to living in a tree in the village of @entity18 ( pictured ) until she apologises but in march he returned home from work a little early to find his new bride in a compromising position with their next - door neighbour			1
hurt and humiliated , he demanded an apology for the infidelity but she refused so he took her back to their village in a bid to resolve their differences			1
but she remained defiant , saying she wanted to return to @entity11 before leaving for her parents house			2
heartsick : after discovering his wife 's infidelity , the heartbroken man returned to his village so in a last ditch effort to win her back , @entity5 shimmied up a guava tree on the outskirts of the village and has remained there ever since			1
he says he will climb down only when his wife apologises for her misdeeds and returns to him			0
despite renewed attempts by his family to persuade her , @entity7 would not budge			0
initially he refused food , surviving only on the guava fruit picked from the branches of the tree			1
but when none were left , he was forced to swallow his pride and relied on his mother , who faithfully brought him snacks from home			2
stubborn : initially @entity5 refused food , surviving only on the guava fruit picked from the branches of the tree ' he climbed on to this tree on march 9 and has remained there ever since			1
whenever we try to bring him down , he threatens to commit suicide , ' @entity5 â€™s mother @entity60 told @entity63			2
' he eats and sleeps on the tree and even relieves himself from there			0
we keep going to him and asking him if he needs anything			0
' some villagers , however , claim to have spotted @entity5 climb down from the tree and go for a stroll when he thinks nobody is watching			0
but they say he quickly scurries back up to his branch if he thinks somebody is nearby			0
his sister @entity74 told the paper they have not called police , adding : ' we apprehend that he may harm himself if we seek outside help			0
as long as he is safe there , we are happy for him			0

he found wife in bed with man at home in @entity11
he took her back to their @entity10 village for apology
when she refused he climbed a guava tree
he ate all fruit , now relies on mother to bring snacks
but villagers say he gets down for strolls when alone
