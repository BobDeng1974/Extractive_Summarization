some venerate it as the burial cloth of @entity3			1
to others , the @entity4 is nothing more than a medieval hoax			0
now , science has come down on the side of the believers			0
researchers have dated a sample of the 14ft linen sheet to anything between @entity14 to 400ad			1
separated at birth : split screen showing the likeness between the @entity4 and a portrait by @entity19 they used forensic tests to compare fibres from the shroud with a range of ancient fabric samples			1
and they discovered that the material could have been made in @entity3 ’s lifetime			0
their results contradict a landmark 1988 study , spearheaded by the @entity32 , which used carbon dating to examine the cloth			1
it said the shroud , which has an imprint of a bearded man with wounds consistent to being nailed to a cross , was actually made in the @entity41 – more than 1,000 years after the @entity42			1
but scientists at @entity44 believe the original results could have been skewed by centuries of water and fire damage			0
the shroud , which is one of @entity52 ’s most controversial relics , was once described by @entity53 as ‘ an icon of suffering in every age ’			1
the findings are in a new book called @entity58 ( @entity59 ) which is published on @entity60			0
the authors , professor @entity62 , an expert in mechanical and thermal measurement at the @entity44 ’s @entity64 and journalist @entity65 , examined fibres from the @entity4 and compared them to samples of cloth dating back to between @entity69 and up to the modern era to contrast them and see if it is a @entity41 forgery			1
has @entity4 mystery been solved ? 14ft - long linen cloth , pictured above left in 1934 , bears the faint image of the front and back of a tall , long - haired , bearded man and appears to be stained by blood from wounds in his feet , wrists and sides that match those suffered by @entity3 at his crucifixion key to the findings are three new tests , two chemical ones and one mechanical , the first two were carried out using infra - red light , and the other using @entity90 spectroscopy - which measures radiation through wavelengths and is commonly used in forensic science			1
the results dated the fibres from the cloth to a period between @entity14 to 400ad , which covers the years of @entity3 's life			1
debate has raged whether the image is that of @entity3 or a fake from the @entity41			0
but what is certain is that experts have never really been able to explain how the image was made			0
carbon 14 tests were conducted on the cloth in 1988 and these findings suggested it dated from between 1260 and 1390			1
however , some scientists have since claimed that contamination over the ages from water damage and fire , were not taken sufficiently into account and could have distorted the results			0
since then , there have been several requests for fresh tests but church chiefs have always refused - and this is why professor @entity62 and his team had to rely on fibres that were used in the 1988 tests			1
before he retired last month pope @entity124 gave permission for the @entity4 to go on display as a ' last gift ’ to the millions of @entity128 before he retired from public office			0
thirteen years ago when he was plain cardinal @entity130 , @entity130 wrote that the shroud was a ‘ truly mysterious image , which no human artistry was capable of producing			1
in some inexplicable it appeared imprinted upon cloth ... ’ @entity136 state tv will broadcast footage of the @entity4 but it is not thought that general public access will be allowed until 2025 , the date of the next scheduled display			1
as part of the tv broadcast , a new app called @entity142 2.0 has been developed , showing a series of hd images of the shroud which highlight details of the cloth not visible to the naked eye			1
the linen cloth , believed by some to have wrapped the body of @entity3 , has captivated the imagination of historians , church chiefs , sceptics and @entity128 for more than 500 years			1
there are no definite historical records concerning the shroud prior to the 14th century			1
although there are numerous reports of @entity3 ' burial shroud , or an image of his head , of unknown origin , being venerated in various locations before the 14th century			2
but there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at @entity169			2
a burial cloth , which some historians maintain was the @entity4 , was owned by the @entity173 emperors but disappeared during the @entity174 in 1204			2
historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the small town of @entity180 around the years 1353 to 1357			2
it was in the possession of a @entity184 @entity183 , @entity185 , who died at the @entity186 in 1356			0
however the correspondence of this shroud with the shroud in @entity169 , and its very origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors , with claims of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart			2
some contend that the @entity180 shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer			2
the history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded			2
in 1532 , the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of @entity207 , capital of the @entity210 region , where it was stored			2
a drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth			0
poor @entity218 attempted to repair this damage with patches			0
in 1578 @entity221 , @entity222 ordered the cloth to be brought from @entity207 to @entity169 and it has remained at @entity169 ever since			0
the shroud has had many notorious admirers			0
it even obsessed @entity226 dictator @entity225 , who wanted to steal it so he could use it in a black magic ceremony			0
in may 2010 , five years after he became @entity53 , @entity130 authorised a public viewing of the @entity4 - the first since 2000 and also 15 years ahead of its next scheduled public display .			0

infra red tests dated the cloth to some time between @entity14 and @entity236
the shroud will appear in a live tv broadcast on *saturday*
