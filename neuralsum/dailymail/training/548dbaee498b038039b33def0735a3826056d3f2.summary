it was a heart - wrenching story that proved too good to be true			0
hundreds of users of social networking sites and blogs followed the trials and tribulations of a @entity8 family over the course of 11 years			2
during that time , they read of five - year - old ' warrior ' @entity12 's battle with cancer and just last month , the death of his mother @entity16 in a car crash en route to the @entity20 hospital where she was a surgeon			0
hoax : pictures used to depict the @entity12 family had been lifted from other people 's profiles on sites such as @entity28 , including images of twins that were actually the children of a @entity33 blogger @entity34 , an officer in the @entity8 royal @entity35 , movingly described how she miraculously hung on to life just long enough to give birth to their 11th child , daughter @entity38			1
all of it , however , was a complex hoax			0
through her blog @entity44 : a hoax ? @entity46 has revealed @entity47 is actually a 22 - year - old medical student living with her father in @entity50			1
one of the only elements of truth in the countless posts on sites such as @entity28 was that the woman - @entity55 - shared a surname with the family she had invented			1
miss @entity46 wrote on the @entity59 website : ' i was very surprised to find out that a med student was behind the whole thing because of the amount of time that had to have been involved with creating so many characters			1
' duped : hundreds of people were tricked into falling for convincing social network profiles that used photos lifted from the internet miss @entity46 speculated that the author may have a condition known as @entity73 disorder by internet , which was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist dr @entity75			1
she said : ' it says that people who have this disorder invent stuff like this over and over and over again			0
' the only real treatment is having their internet use carefully monitored			2
' the most outrageous message was posted on @entity28 on may 13 - @entity81 in @entity83 - when ' @entity44 ' broke the grim news that @entity85 had died from injuries sustained in a car crash			2
fabrication : widower @entity34 poured out his grief over the supposed death of his wife @entity16 in this @entity28 post , which went viral it read : ' last night at 12:02am i lost the love of my life			2
i lost my wife , the mother of my children and my best friend			0
' she fought so hard to cling to life			0
all of the doctors could n't believe she survived as long as she did			0
' a tribute page quickly sprang up in memory of mrs @entity55 and raised more than $ 1,000 for a cancer charity before it was taken down			2
meanwhile , hundreds of people left condolence messages on @entity28			2
it was at this point , however , that the hoax began to unravel			0
it emerged that pictures used to depict the @entity12 family had been lifted from other people 's profiles on sites such as @entity28 and @entity117 , including images of twins that were actually the children of a @entity33 blogger			1
vital clue : @entity46 managed to track down the person behind the fake posts using the @entity50 return address @entity55 provided when she sent warrior @entity44 bracelets to online followers like the one pictured above as more questions were asked , the warrior @entity28 page was deleted and the privacy settings increased for the @entity47 and @entity85 profiles			1
@entity12 's page on the @entity135 networking site was also made private			0
to track down those behind the charade , @entity46 set up a blog and email address for people to send information			0
she tracked down @entity55 after she was told the woman - described online as the younger sister of @entity47 - sent warrior @entity44 bracelets to anybody who requested them			1
@entity55 provided a return address in @entity149 , @entity50 - and miss @entity46 found she was the only person mentioned on the sites who was real			1
after being outed , miss @entity55 apologised in a written statement published on miss @entity46 's blog			1
it said : ' i am deeply sorry for all the pain i have caused everyone			1
' it was never my intention to do so			0
' this all started 11 years ago when i was a bored 11 - year - old kid looking for an escape from the pain and heartache i saw in my own family			2
' it started almost as a fiction writing , but the more time i spent escaping to it , the more " real " it became			0
' i am so sorry it hurt so many real families , and so many people out there			0
' miss @entity46 said that although the hundreds of people who were duped are angry , miss @entity55 does not appear to have committed a crime because she did not materially gain from the hoax			1
money raised for the cancer charity went straight into their coffers , she said			0
however , she said that miss @entity55 's medical school is carrying out an investigation .			1

@entity50 medical student , 22 , invented several online characters using profiles on sites like @entity28 and lifting photos from the internet
she is not thought to have committed a crime , however , as she did not appear to materially gain
after being outed , @entity55 said she was ' deeply sorry for all the pain i have caused everyone '
