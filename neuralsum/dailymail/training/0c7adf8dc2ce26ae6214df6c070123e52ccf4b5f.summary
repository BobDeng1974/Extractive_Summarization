for years , experts have warned that robots could soon take over our jobs - and for bank workers in @entity6 , this threat just became a reality			2
a humanoid called @entity9 will begin working at branches of @entity11 from april , on a trial basis			1
but , if the trial is successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the @entity6 bank by 2020			1
it has two cameras mounted to its head , that act as eyes , as well as four directional microphones			1
the 1ft 11in ( 58cm ) bot also has touch sensors , can speak 19 languages and reads emotions @entity9 is designed by @entity30 firm @entity9			1
it has two cameras mounted to its head , that act as eyes , as well as four directional microphones to act as its ears			1
the 1ft 11in ( 58cm ) bot also has touch sensors , can speak 19 languages and is able to read and respond to emotions , by analysing facial expressions			1
this analysis is made using embedded software called @entity44			2
during a presentation in @entity46 this week , @entity9 welcomed customers to the bank , and asked which service they required			1
@entity50 has produced more than 5,000 of its @entity9 humanoid , and it is primarily used for research and educational purposes			1
@entity54 has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			2
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity60 and @entity61 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity54 research benefits humanity			2
@entity65 warning : professor @entity61 says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			0
the document , drafted by the @entity74 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity54 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			0
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			1
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity54 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			1
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity54 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			0
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity54 may put millions of people out of work			1
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming			1
during a presentation in @entity46 this week , @entity9 welcomed @entity11 customers and asked which service they required			1
if the trial is successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the bank across the country by the @entity131 @entity50 has produced more than 5,000 of its @entity9 humanoid , and it is primarily used for research and educational purposes ( pictured )			1
the @entity137 robots retail from 198,000 yen ( £ 1,107 ) and can understand 80 per cent of conversations			0
they also have the ability to learn from conversations claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years , office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans			0
the idea that robots will one day be able to do all low - skilled jobs is not new , but @entity153 from @entity154 artificial intelligence company , @entity155 , said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought			0
@entity54 , for example , can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically , while the latest models are also capable of making decisions traditionally made by humans			0
‘ the fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks , but constantly learn how to do it better and faster , means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were , ' mr @entity153 said			0
for example , a machine can recognise duplicate insurance claims by knowing it has seen a phone number or an address before			1
@entity9 is made by the same firm that builds @entity175			1
in december , @entity176 hired 1,000 @entity175 robots to work across home appliance stores in @entity6 , where they help customers looking for a @entity182 coffee machine			1
@entity175 robots are also used in @entity185 stores as shop assistants , because @entity50 is a subsidiary of the mobile carrier			0
equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology , @entity175 is able to read people 's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they 're feeling			0
' @entity175 will be able to explain @entity176 products and services and engage in conversation with consumers			0
' i hope that this new consumer engagement model will expand across the world as an example of @entity6 innovation , ' said @entity204 , president and chief executive of @entity206			0
' the dream to create an advanced consumer experience with @entity175 is now coming true			0

they also have the ability to learn from conversations			0

it touched hands with @entity185 chief executive @entity222 in a moment described by the firm as a @entity225 or ' @entity227 ' moment robotic companions are hugely popular in @entity6 , but they have failed to become commercial successes			2
@entity6 electronics and entertainment company @entity230 discontinued the @entity234 pet - dog robot in 2006 , despite an outcry from its fans			2
at that time , @entity230 had developed a child - shaped entertainment robot similar to @entity175 but much smaller , capable of dances and other charming moves			2
however , it never became a commercial product			0
@entity242 has developed the walking , talking @entity245 robot , but that is too sophisticated and expensive for home use , and appears in @entity242 showrooms and at gala events only			2
the @entity50 robots ( @entity175 pictured ) retail from 198,000 yen ( £ 1,107 ) and can understand 80 per cent of conversations			0

@entity185 chief executive @entity222 is shown interacting with the robot in @entity46			2

robot will work on a trial basis at @entity11 branches
these trials of the 1ft 11inch ( 58cm ) assistant are expected to begin in april
@entity9 has four microphones , touch sensors and can speak 19 languages
makers @entity9 said it can also recognise human emotions
if successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches
