by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:44 est , 3 february 2014 he 's a man of few words , but what @entity6 running back @entity5 , 27 , lacks in conversation he more than makes up for in dance moves			1
during the post-match press - conference , the famously taciturn player uttered a few sentences - and then chose to express his joy over the team 's victory through the medium of dance			1
wearing a red hoodie , matching sweat pants , black cap , gold headphones and with a black scarf covering his mouth , @entity5 plugged his @entity23 into some speakers and turned up the volume on ' @entity26 ' by @entity28 rapper @entity27			1
the joyful movements probably expressed @entity5 's feelings better than any words could			1
and he had every reason to celebrate : he scored a touchdown for his team in the second quarter of the game			2
the @entity6 stormed home beating the @entity35 decisively , 43 to eight			1
@entity5 's reluctance to speak to the media is well documented			2
in 2013 , he was fined $ 50,000 for refusing to speak to the media throughout the 2013 @entity52 season			1
the @entity52 later agreed not to collect the fee as long as @entity5 promised to comply with the league 's media policies going forward - failure to do so will result in a $ 100,000 fine			1
not shy : @entity5 's reticence has nothing to day with introversion solo show : @entity5 did n't need anyone to join him in his performance in the bag : @entity5 on the sidelines during the third quarter against the @entity35 during @entity36 at @entity37 on february 2 he did manage a few words yesterday - 43 , to be precise - but @entity5 has always been a man who believes actions speak louder than words			1
during the @entity70 , he managed six minutes on the podium answering reporters questions before bolting			2
later , @entity52 media 's @entity73 managed to corner him as he made his getaway and the two had a one - on - one in which @entity5 made his feelings on idle chatter clear			1
' i ai n't never seen no talking winning nothing			0
been like that since i was little			0
i was raised like that , ' he said			0
' i 'm gon na get it			0
do n't need to talk about it			0
' the @entity87 did not agree			0
big win : @entity5 celebrates with fans after the @entity91 football game against the @entity35 sunday , february 2 ' several of our long - standing and high profile members were appalled by mr @entity5 's conduct and refusal to answer any questions , ' the statement read , per @entity99			2
@entity6 coach @entity100 was n't concerned			2
' i heard he did a great six minutes , ' @entity6 coach @entity100 said , reports @entity52			1
' some comedians make a career off of that			0
' the @entity52 agrees : ' players are required to participate and he participated , ' @entity52 spokesman @entity106 said			2
all action : @entity5 ( 24 ) is tackled by @entity35 ' @entity109 ( 56 ) during the first half of the @entity91 football game sunday and the 43 words ? on winning the @entity114 : ' dream come true			1
' on that touchdown run : ' kicked it all off , boss			0
' on him not celebrating on the field : ' man , [ my teammates ] know how i feel about it			0
this has been a tradition since i came , since forever			0
it 's just what i do			0
' on if it 's the best day of his life : ' next to being born			0

@entity5 spoke *briefly* to press @entity137 then chose to express himself through dance
he plugged his @entity23 into some speakers and performed a victory dance alone to ' @entity26 ' by @entity27
@entity5 , the @entity6 ' running back , is notoriously taciturn
last year , he was fined $ 50,000 by the @entity52 for not participating in @entity145
the fine was lifted but will be *doubled* if he does not comply with @entity52 participation rules in future
if his dance did not *accurately* convey his feelings about the @entity6 ' victory , he did express them in words : ' dream come true , ' he said
