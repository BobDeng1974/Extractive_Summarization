‘ where i come from , ’ says the man standing between @entity1 and his mega-fight with @entity3 , ‘ it ’s not good to be cocky			1
’ where @entity5 comes from is @entity7 , a 15 - minute drive from the combustible town of @entity10 in which riots against white police killing unarmed black men have fanned out across @entity14			1
‘ where i come from , ’ @entity5 continues with cutting reference to growing up on the mean streets , ‘ you do n’t brag that you ’re better than everyone			1
because in our communities we believe nobody is better than anybody			2
but to make sure , @entity5 drives it home : ‘ i ’ve not been around @entity1 much but i hear a lot about him			1
and what i hear - even from boxing fans in the @entity26 - is that he ’s arrogant			2
a lot of people hate him			0
that ’s the feed back			0
‘ if you ’re as good as he says he is you do n’t have to tell everyone			2
because the cockier you are the harder you fall			0
’ the shrewd odds - makers in the @entity33 casinos do not expect @entity1 to fall in the @entity32 on saturday night			1
they quote @entity52 ’s 28 - year - old at 1 - 3 on , @entity5 at 2 - 1 against			1
as @entity58 held court in a luxury box overlooking the @entity62 sports book he jerked a thumb in the direction of the giant screens behind him and said : ‘ the odds are not important			0
any more than they would be important if they favoured me			0
they only matter to the gambler			0
and if you ’re going to have a bet , put it on me			0
’ @entity1 poses with for photos with two women during the press conference in @entity33 @entity5 said even @entity26 boxing fans were happy to admit that @entity52 - born @entity1 was a narcissist @entity75 ’s @entity74 promotions , who represent both fighters , would reportedly prefer @entity1 to win nor does it concern him that for all @entity75 ’s unfailing respect for all fighting men , his @entity74 promotion company want @entity1 to win			1
@entity5 says : ‘ i sense the preference			1
but when i win it will not be an upset in my mind			0
and if it upsets their plans , hard luck			0
’ clearly the design is for @entity1 not only to defeat his fellow former world champion but to do so in such spectacular style that the public will demand @entity3 finally gives him his shot at the really big time			1
@entity5 smiles at that notion and says : ‘ he has n’t done anything in our sport to deserve the big fight with @entity3			1
he ’s had a lot gimmes in his career			0
look at my resume – constant back to back fights against the best			0
’ the perceived wisdom here is that @entity1 ’s lighting speed , light - footed movement and eradication of his old mistakes under new trainer @entity109 will prevail			1
to which @entity5 responds thus : ‘ speed ? i ’m fast too			1
‘ movement ? i move a lot			0
‘ mistakes ? he still makes them			0
’ @entity5 claimed his track record showed consistent bouts against the best opposition available the @entity7 - born fighter said he could match his @entity26 opponent both in terms of speed and movement @entity5 insisted that whoever won between him and @entity1 deserves a shot at @entity124 @entity5 comes from the classically tough background of the black @entity14 fighter			1
where he comes from , to be precise , is @entity128			0
the one in @entity129 is more leafy and fashionable than the neighbourhood in @entity7 , which is most commonly described as ‘ down - trodden , rough , drug - riddled and gang - infested			0
’ he is the star graduate of the gritty gym in @entity10 at which his wise old trainer @entity132 offered boys an alternative to running with the street gangs			0
like @entity1 , @entity5 turned professional at 17 , albeit not with an @entity138 medal to show for his fine amateur career			1
now he becomes the first professional @entity1 will have fought who is younger than himself			2
@entity5 , too , is excited to be topping the bill at the @entity32 ‘ the @entity142 of boxing			2
’ unlike @entity1 , this will be his first appearance in @entity33			1
will the winner , no matter which of them , deserve to fight @entity3 ? ‘ sure			2
‘ why not ? ’ he answers his own question and when he does so you can tell he senses that even if he is victorious he may not be granted that enriching gift : ‘ even after i beat @entity1 he may still be the one to get the call			2
because he brings @entity26 television money to the table			0
’ young men who fight their way out of @entity158 never forget their economic reality			2
@entity1 speaks to the press ahead of his 33rd career fight , he has only lost three so far bookmakers have @entity1 favourite at 1 - 3 on , his opponent @entity5 is at 2 - 1 against many believe @entity1 's new trainer , @entity109 ( left ) , will help him eradicate his usual mistakes @entity168 will be televised live on @entity169 late saturday night .			1

@entity5 will fight @entity1 in @entity33 on saturday
the @entity14 has *criticised* his opponent 's arrogance
@entity5 said if @entity1 was really good enough he would n't need to brag
he also said whoever won deserved a fight with @entity124
