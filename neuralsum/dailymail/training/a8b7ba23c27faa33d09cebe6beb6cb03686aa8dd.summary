a parish council discussion about geese in the village pond would normally warrant barely a ripple of interest			2
but police were called when a villager got into a flap amid claims that she was not being allowed to film just such a debate			1
@entity10 said councillors in @entity12 , near @entity13 in @entity14 , failed to provide a decent vantage point and that when she moved from the designated spot , the chairman ’s wife , @entity17 , 71 , repeatedly tried to obscure her view			1
two officers arrived , but took no further action when a member of the public assured them things were under control			0
mrs @entity10 , 67 , a retired secondary school teacher , said : ‘ unfortunately , my camera stopped recording just as [ chairman ] @entity38 yelled “ you ca n’t film this ”			1
‘ calling the police was unnecessary and embarrassing			2
when they arrived , someone ran out and spoke to them and they never came in , although it had n’t even calmed down at that point			0
what a waste of police time			0
’ mrs @entity10 and her partner @entity22 , 70 , a retired farm worker , are concerned about the council ’s ‘ inhumane ’ policy of reintroducing geese to the village green			1
there used to be ten birds at the spot but all died , the mother of one says , because of problems such as dog attacks , being run over by cars or having inadequate shelter			0

‘ they should not be putting more animals in a situation where they could be killed , ’ mrs @entity10 said			2
mrs @entity10 and her partner @entity22 , 70 , a retired farm worker , are concerned about the council ’s ‘ inhumane ’ policy of reintroducing geese to the village green councillors were forced to accept the filming of meetings last year after a change of law , which led to three members quitting			1

he said : ‘ we have been given guidelines from the @entity97			0
it says the parish council chairman can set a designated filming area			2
she was not filming from the area we provided			0
‘ i am quite a big fellow			0
i could have manhandled her out , but that would have been a bigger headline than the one we are looking at now			0
’ he added : ‘ the filming itself is not the problem – it ’s the harassment and abuse caused by cutting it and editing it and putting it on @entity112 , which just makes the work of a parish councillor that much harder			1
