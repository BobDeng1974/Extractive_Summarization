some of the world 's greatest players will be in @entity2 and match - winners will be plentiful			1
@entity4 picks his 10 to watch at the @entity5			1
he must be hurting with people saying he ’s not the best player in the world anymore			1
i ’ve never seen him walk around the pitch as much as this season at @entity12 — he needs to up his tempo			1
if he does , he can do what @entity14 did and win the tournament for his country			1
rumour has it he ’s been saving himself for this — let ’s hope it ’s true			2
up the tempo : rumour has it @entity25 has been saving himself for the @entity5 - he must deliver i was unsure about the @entity2 star for a while , but he had a fantastic @entity28 last summer , devastatingly good			2
there is more pressure on him than any other player at the @entity5 : he ’s the pin - up , the home talent , the hope of a nation			2
it ’s not a vintage @entity2 side but he is the one man who can produce a moment of genius			2
pin - up : there is a lot of pressure on @entity45 and he will hope to repeat his @entity28 displays the player of the year ’s confidence will be sky high after winning the @entity51			2
if he catches fire , @entity52 have half a chance of doing very well			2
the @entity56 forward can score any way — left foot , right foot , headers and free kicks — and is backed up by an organised @entity52 side that is used to the heat			2
@entity65 - high confidence : and if @entity66 catches fire , @entity52 could do very well yes , he dives but @entity68 has so much ability and skill			1
@entity71 wants to play him centrally instead of on the wing and he could thrive there			2
good players need to be in the game , not peripheral figures on the wing			2
playing in the middle will allow him to produce more magic			0
@entity81 figure : @entity82 might play @entity68 through the middle so he can influence games if he ’s fit , he will terrorise @entity85 and anybody he plays against			1
he ’s an absolute phenomenon who is capable of doing things no - one else can			0
it will be a real shame if he ’s not quite right as the @entity5 needs him on fire			0
but i ’ve had knee operations and know it can take a while to feel 100 per cent			1
phenomenon : the @entity5 needs a fit - and - firing @entity97 , who is capable of doing outrageous things i love watching him			1
he makes @entity99 tick with his ability to outpass or outdribble his opponent from midfield			0
manipulates the ball so well , seeing a different game to everybody else			0
is a step ahead of everyone			0
if @entity108 is fit and @entity109 can feed him , @entity99 will be so dangerous again			1
the manipulator : @entity109 makes @entity99 tick and will be the main supply line to @entity108 i was never a fan of his at @entity114 because he was poison in the dressing room			1
in some ways , i ’m not sure why i ’m picking him on this list			1
but the @entity121 striker is still box office and you never know what he is going to do			0
his pace and power will cause trouble for @entity85 ’s defenders and @entity129 and @entity130 will be hoping he is not in the starting @entity131 was @entity133 ’s star when they reached the @entity135 and will either destroy his own team or the opposition			0
@entity139 and power : @entity141 is capable of destroying opponents ... and his own side he is either going to set the tournament alight or get dropped			0
this is the biggest tournament of his @entity85 career			0
@entity148 has never scored at a @entity5 and that ’s not good enough for a man of his ability			1
he can produce the magic @entity85 will need to get out of such a tough group			0
no middle ground : @entity148 will either set the @entity5 alight or be dropped by @entity85 @entity156 have got lots of good technical players , but @entity159 is the best of the bunch			1
a skilful playmaker , he dribbles well and was hugely impressive in the @entity164 final for @entity165			0
he will surprise people in @entity2 and could earn himself a big move after the @entity5			0
best of the bunch : playmaker @entity159 is @entity156 's star and may surprise some people in @entity2 @entity170 started the season looking like a world beater and ended it fading away and falling out with @entity174			1
the @entity176 playmaker needs to bounce back and inspire this very exciting @entity178 team			0
he has the ability to go from standing still to sprinting in the blink of an eye , which makes him horrible to play against			0
one criticism would be that he needs to add more goals to his game — he only managed one from open play in his last 16 games of the season			0
now is a good time to start			0
bounce back : @entity170 was brilliant at the start of last season but faded away towards the end @entity25 ( @entity194 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .7/1 @entity45 ( @entity2 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			1
.12/1 @entity195 ( @entity194 ) ... ... ... ... ... .14/1 @entity66 ( @entity52 ) ... ... ... ... ... .14/1 @entity196 ( @entity2 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 20/1 @entity97 ( @entity197 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 22/1 @entity198 ( @entity194 ) ... ... ... ... 22/1 @entity108 ( @entity99 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .25/1 @entity199 ( @entity2 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 28/1 @entity200 ( @entity201 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... .28/1 @entity202 ( @entity82 ) ... ... ... ... ... .33/1 @entity203 ( @entity178 ) ... ... ... ... ... ...			1
.33/1 and what about the @entity205 boys ? @entity148 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .40/1 @entity206 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			1
.66/1 @entity207 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .200/1			0

@entity148 and @entity209 will either be brilliant or a *disaster*
@entity97 could be phenomenal if he is 100 *%* fit
