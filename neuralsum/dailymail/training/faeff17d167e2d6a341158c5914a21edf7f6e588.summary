@entity1 fans are about to find out if it 's mere coincidence that @entity4 's injury has triggered a run of poor form , or whether the 25 - year - old striker really is the most important player at @entity8 , ahead of @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity4 is due back on sunday against @entity11 after a thigh injury controversially picked up on @entity14 duty at the start of september , with @entity1 facing @entity16 three days later			1
and the facts are these			0
before @entity4 's injury , @entity1 had won two of their three matches and scored six goals			1
a win ratio of 66 per cent and goal average of two per game			0
@entity4 is set to return from injury for @entity1 at @entity11 this weekend @entity4 has been out of action since sustaining an injury while on @entity14 duty in september the striker scored @entity1 's winner in their opening - game victory against @entity32 at @entity8 since his lay - off , @entity1 have won two of seven games and scored only eight goals despite signing @entity37 from @entity38 for £ 16million			1
a win percentage of 28.57 per cent and goal average of 1.14 per game			0
no wonder @entity1 manager @entity42 is so looking forward to his @entity14 striker 's return			1
' @entity4 is obviously a top talent whatever part of the game he comes into			2
and it helps to have his pace especially when you are 1 - 0 up and the opposition has to come at you , ' says @entity42 , whose unhappiness with the way @entity14 handled his player 's recovery time is well - documented and opened a sore between club and country that shows no sign of healing			2
the exploits of @entity62 last season and the hype surrounding @entity9 since the @entity64 has helped people forget it could be @entity4 who is the key man at @entity1			2
@entity9 scored on the opening day ( left ) but has struggled to recapture his form of last year @entity37 has struggled since his £ 16m move to @entity1 from @entity38 in the summer he scored 21 times in 26 @entity71 starts last season and his influence did n't stop there			1
a shooting accuracy of 49.41 per cent underlines his composure in front of goal in addition to his undoubted pace , movement and dribbling skills			0
half of those shots on target resulted in goals			0
particularly impressive is the number of opportunities he creates			0
last season , he made 29 chances in league games			0
in the three matches he played this season , he scored once , had five other shots and created three chances			0
without him , the form of @entity9 , @entity98 , @entity37 and @entity99 has diminished with @entity100 having to work overtime to be a creator as well as a midfield general			2
@entity37 has scored just one goal for @entity1 , in the @entity104 against @entity105 and missed this chance against @entity107 @entity99 has started just two games for @entity1 since his £ 4m move from @entity32 he is integral to @entity42 staying true to @entity1 's pass - and - move philosophy			1
around 75 per cent of @entity4 's passes in the opposition half are accurate , impressive given the close marking he receives			2
@entity10 , who has played with a few decent strikers in his time , has said of @entity4 : ' his movement is fantastic			0
as a midfielder when you look up , you want to see one of your forwards coming in to feet for the easy option and you want to see one on the shoulder of the defence and in between the two centre halves			0
' is it too simplistic to say @entity4 's imminent return will spark @entity1 into a revival and recapture last season 's form when they nearly won the league ? it is a lot to rest on one player 's shoulders but the @entity137 will hope @entity4 will show straight away just how badly he 's been missed			1
