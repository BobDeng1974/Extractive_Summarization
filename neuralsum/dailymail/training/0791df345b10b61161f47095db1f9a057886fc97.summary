by @entity0 @entity1 conducted an experiment among nearly 700,000 users to gauge how posts on the site affect people 's moods			1
the social media giant manipulated news feeds of just over 689,000 users to highlight either positive or negative items and then monitored responses over the course of a random week			1
it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts , according to the results of a study published this week in @entity23			1
massive study : a team of researchers culling data from nearly 700,000 @entity1 users found that our moods are affected by posts from friends ‘ this tested whether exposure to emotions led people to change their own posting behaviors , in particular whether exposure to emotional content led people to post content that was consistent with the exposure , ’ the study said			2
researchers found that negative posts are met with encouragement , but a reduction in happy posts was met with a surprising amount of negativity			1
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the team			2
posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word , according to the researchers			2
‘ these results indicate that emotions expressed by others on @entity1 influence our own emotions , constituting experimental evidence for massive - scale contagion via social networks			0
’ of the millions of posts analyzed , four - million were found to be positive and 1.8million were determined to be negative			0
the findings led the team to conclude that ‘ in - person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion			0
’ this experiment was limited to users who viewed @entity1 in @entity78 , but it is not known across which geographic boundaries			0
