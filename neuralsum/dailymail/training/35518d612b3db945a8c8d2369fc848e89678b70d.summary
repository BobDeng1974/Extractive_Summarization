by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 01:32 est , 23 july 2013 her mother fell for the @entity4 's front man but it 's the @entity6 who make @entity8 go weak at the knees in a new advert			1
the model recreates @entity12 in the latest campaign for make - up brand @entity14			2
dressed in a monochrome mini dress , the model swoons and screams she dances to a tune played by a band resembling @entity6 in their heyday			1
at the age of 21 , @entity37 was n't born when the @entity6 first found fame and went on to rival her father @entity34 's band the @entity48 in the charts			1
her mother , @entity33 , also a model , went on to win @entity34 's heart but it 's the @entity6 who set @entity37 's pulse racing in the advert			1
the star is currently one of the world 's most in demand models with campaigns for @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity64 perfume already under her belt this year			2
in the genes : the model flashes the long legs she inherited from her mother drawing back the decades : at 21 - years - old , @entity12 was long before @entity37 's time @entity74 was a @entity4 : but it 's this band resembling the @entity6 that @entity37 goes wild for in the campaign the gap in her teeth , that she refused to correct with braces when she was younger , is one of her most famous traits but she told net - a - porter 's @entity84 last month that she worries it will maker her look ' scary ' when she 's older			1
' i still worry i 'm going to look weird as i get older			0
i 'll be a weird old woman with scary teeth , ' she joked			0
while she always looks flawless in advert campaigns , like the one for @entity14 , she added that she 's glad her gappy teeth show young girls that you do n't have to look perfect to be beautiful			0
she said : ' there 's this whole idea of perfection ( in modeling )			0
what younger girls do n't realise is that these girls do have problems			0
it 's good for people to realise everyone is human			0
