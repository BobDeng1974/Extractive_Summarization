wearing a huge doorknocker through your nose may not be the epitome of high fashion for most of us , but this catwalk trend is now hitting the @entity7			0
the look was first seen in @entity10 ’s autumn / winter 2013 fashion show in @entity11 , when designer @entity12 sent both male and female models down the runway with intricately embellished , oversized nose rings			1
unsurprisingly , pieces by the high - end @entity18 designer do not come cheap : a single pale gold hoop nose ring with wing and jet crystal detail was on sale for $ 595 ( £ 388 ) at @entity24 department store			2
however , you can now get the couture look at a fraction of the price as @entity7 brand @entity29 has come up with a lookalike ‘ spike ’ nose ring - for just £ 5			1
punk look : the @entity29 doorknocker septum ring costs just £ 5 - and does n't require you to have your nose pierced not born that way : @entity38 had her septum pierced while in @entity40 this week			1
she 's pictured here with the man who punched the hole the clip - on hoop is made from stainless steel and features faceted stones either side of the central spike to give a touch of sparkle			1
it 's designed to hang down over the lip , like the @entity10 jewellery			2
happily for the squeamish but fashion - conscious , neither the @entity10 and @entity29 versions require a piercing			1
however , the trend for puncturing the septum appears to be gathering steam			0
last week , @entity38 posted a video of herself having a hole punched between her nostrils , while @entity64 had hers done way back in 2006			0
at this year 's punk - themed @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 both wore delicate septum hoops			2
the glamorously @entity71 look which so impressed on the @entity10 catwalk was inspired by the meatpacking industry and iconic biker looks			0
the striking nose jewellery was paired with oversized stud earrings by the male models , while the women showcased elaborate , chandelier - style earrings , which reached below their shoulders			2
winner by a nose : the dramatic jewellery stole the show as models walked the runway during the @entity88 show in @entity11 star power : model @entity90 wore an embellished nose ring at a charity event in @entity94 last month ( left ) and actress @entity67 channelled her inner punk at this year 's @entity66 with a temporary ring striking : writer and performer @entity98 attended the @entity101 show wearing an oversized nose ring delicate : @entity10 's pale gold hoop nose ring with wing and jet crystal detail was on sale for $ 595 ( £ 388 ) at @entity24 but wearing a septum ring can mean more than a simple fashion statement			1
the nasal piercing is traditionally associated with @entity111 countries , such as @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114			0
bengali women traditionally wear the ' nathori ' piercing as a sign of being a married woman			0
the area pierced - the small gap between the dividing wall between the nostril and the bottom of the nose - is full of nerve endings , so the process can be extremely painful			0
a septum piercing also takes between a month and three months to heal and needs to be carefully cleaned to prevent infection			0
think we might stick to clip - ons for the time being ... celebrity trend : @entity38 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) have both had their septums pierced catwalk inspiration : @entity136 piercing and huge double nasal rings were also seen on men in the @entity139 2013 shows , worn with oversized stud earrings androgynous model @entity90 has been sporting a decorative septum ring this year ( left ) , and even @entity67 wore one to the @entity66 at the @entity143 ( right ) @entity68 attended the @entity66 for the ' punk : chaos to @entity147 ' exhibition at the @entity143 wearing a septum ring ( right ) and @entity38 recently had hers pierced ( left ) make - up free : the 27 - year - old shunned her usual heavy make - up opting to go completely natural @entity151 , $ 10.00 ( £ 6.50 ) @entity153 gold tone ear cuff with feather embellishment £ 13 @entity155 , $ 43 ( £ 28 )			1
