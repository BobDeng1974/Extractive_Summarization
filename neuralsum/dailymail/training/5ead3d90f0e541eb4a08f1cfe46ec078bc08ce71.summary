the aim is to ensure the most serious , life - threatening calls are dealt with first			0
the categories are nationally agreed , by the @entity133 and each ambulance service across the @entity67 are measured according to required targets			0
- @entity137 most serious category , @entity138 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life - threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac @entity146 ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight @entity149 possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to @entity138 calls - commonly a rapid response car , who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene , followed by an ambulance , who can transport the patient to hospital			2

- @entity193 are serious but not life - threatening calls , for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious @entity198 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes			0
- @entity201 deemed serious but not life - threatening , @entity203 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs , or a patient who has fallen and maybe @entity208 calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes			0
- @entity211 are non-emergency calls which require an on - scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes			0
a patient who has suffered a suspected overdose , but is showing no serious symptoms , or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a @entity223 call			0
- @entity224 are the least serious calls , which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an @entity229 scalding , a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain , but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a @entity203 4 999 call			2
