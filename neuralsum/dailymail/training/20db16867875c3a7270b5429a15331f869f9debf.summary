united head into saturday ’s home game with @entity7 at @entity8 still reeling from sunday ’s embarrassment and missing 10 players through injury and suspension			1
@entity13 says he is determined to get to the root cause of the physical problems his players are suffering and is looking at the club ’s day - to - day training methods in minute detail			1
@entity0 says his @entity1 have defended well bar last sunday 's match at @entity4 @entity13 admits he has a selection headache of @entity1 's home clash against @entity7 @entity13 was a frustrated figure as @entity1 ( centre ) capitulated to @entity4 5 - 3 on sunday @entity1 have conceded eight goals in five @entity27 matches this season and 12 in all competitions following their 4 - 0 @entity31 second round thrashing at @entity32			1
16 aug - @entity1 1 - 2 @entity33 24 aug - @entity34 1 - 1 @entity1 26 aug - @entity32 dons 4 - 0 @entity1 30 aug - @entity35 0 - 0 @entity1 14 sep - @entity1 4 - 0 @entity36 21 sep - @entity4 5 - 3 @entity1 however , the @entity38 coach still feels there has been an over-reaction to events at @entity4 , which saw his team concede a 3 - 1 advantage in the final half - hour to suffer one of their worst @entity27 defeats in recent memory			1
asked if he felt any sense of panic , @entity13 said : ‘ no. it is happening , it ’s about overcoming it			1
it ’s not a regular occurrence when you see our figures in the @entity27			1
except ( for ) this match , we are defending well , our average is less than one and we scored a lot of goals			2
‘ i think we are fifth or sixth in terms of goals , i do n’t know			2
i see the difficulty as , more or less , a lot of journalists			2
i say only that you are looking the other way			2
maybe you can listen very carefully			2
defender @entity67 will miss saturday 's match after being substituted against @entity4 with an injury @entity70 has come in for criticism in the heart of @entity1 's defence @entity75 defender @entity74 ( left ) is also ruled out of saturday 's match with a hamstring injury ‘ we have had some wins and should have ( had more ) wins			1
when you are 3 - 1 ahead after 60 minutes you have to win			2
then we are two points off second in the table			2
but because of the loss we are sitting here and you are talking like that and questioning me like that			2
‘ if we had won this game it was a different story , so you do n’t have to make an incident sound as if it is a regular basis			2
we will overcome and the season lasts more than one competition day			0
’ @entity13 confirmed @entity93 ’s story from thursday that defender @entity70 had become the latest player to break down in training			1
@entity70 will join @entity67 and @entity74 on the sidelines , while @entity97 is suspended after being sent off at the @entity98			1
the manager added : ‘ i have to admit that i ’m never in this situation before , so that ’s strange , and that is also what i have said in former press conferences			0
@entity13 added that he believes @entity1 can finish in the top three or four this season @entity105 can still be successful - @entity106 @entity67 ( centre ) has a badly bruised bone and @entity0 says he wo n't take any risks with him ‘ for me it ’s difficult to understand , because we are evaluating what we can do in a different way , but you have to train on a certain level because otherwise you ca n’t play a game			1
‘ i ’ve already said i will adapt to a certain level but i can not train lower because then you ca n’t perform in the right way			0
‘ we have a lot of injuries , nine injuries now , and @entity97 suspended , so that means that 10 are out			0
all the three right sided centre halves are out			0
‘ @entity67 is a very difficult thing			1
his bone is bruised a lot and we have to wait and see — and evaluate			0
‘ @entity70 , yesterday in a training session he ran out because he had stiff legs so we ’ll wait and see what that ’s meaning , but i do n’t take risks			1
you have to be fit and i always trust younger players			0
‘ so i have to go to the youth team to pick players and i have also said that in former press conferences			0
the younger players can pick their chances now and that ’s also the policy of this club			0
i have read that differently in the media , but it ’s like that			0
@entity97 ( right ) was sent off for @entity1 during their humbling at the @entity98 @entity13 read his team the riot act after sunday ’s defeat but refused to blame them for one of the most bizarre @entity1 performances of recent times			1
he added : ‘ i do n’t think my players are robots , they are human beings and i think that human beings make errors and faults			0
i ’m a manager who always wants to evaluate and discuss			0
that ’s the way i do it and i have done it this week also			0
‘ the young players are always ready			0
they have hunger to play			0
@entity1 youth education has a certain level that can provide that			1
‘ it ’s a big difference from youth level to @entity27 but in one game you can show yourself better than regular			1
’ asked if this was the hardest challenge he had faced in his career , @entity13 was candid			1
he said : ‘ at this moment , maybe , but you have to see in a year and not in one week when we have nine injuries and a red card			0
i do n’t think that you can judge the effect			0
‘ as a manager you already know in advance that it ’s a big challenge and this club is in a transition			0
now we are in very difficult circumstances again but we can win			0
