a mysterious clown has been showing up in public places across @entity2 for several days and residents of the @entity5 borough are reacting on social media with everything from laughter to fear to outright anger			1
the clown has thus far been known to hang out near train stations , in front of bank in broad daylight and behind trees at dusk , where he smiles and slowly waves at passersby while holding little balloons			1
while the clown has n't broken any laws , he 's caused a ruckus from @entity25 who ca n't help but associate it to the blood - thirsty killer clown of @entity28			1
' guess who ai n't sleeping tonight			0
' the haunting trickster first started cropping up on @entity25 ' newsfeeds in the last week or two			0
last sunday , comedian @entity45 posted a video he took of the clown to @entity48			2
it shows the clown waving and pointing at drivers in broad daylight as they pass a @entity54 drivethru			0
' @entity55 , how ? ' @entity45 wondered			0
scary either way : the clown 's appearances , which are thus far unexplained , come at both night and during broad daylight boo ! one man posted this photo of the clown as it waved from behind a tree in a residential area while @entity45 's experience was creepy , the clown appears to be at his scariest in the dark			1
@entity69 learned this the hard way			0
' ok so i 'm a little freaked out right now			0
i was driving home from @entity74 and saw this waving at me , ' wrote @entity69 on @entity39 after snapping the clown , which appeared from behind a tree			0
@entity78 also saw the clown at night , near a train station waving to cars as he was caught by their high beams			2
' he was just kinda standing there waving , ' said the confused @entity78			0
the reason behind the bizarre appearance of the @entity2 clown remains unexplained , but if a similar story from across the @entity91 is any indication , the man behind the white makeup is little more than a prankster			2
last year , residents of the @entity96 town of @entity97 started being spooked by a very similar clown , who turned out to be a college student named @entity101			1
the same clown ? a @entity2 man caught the clown in broad daylight last sunday ( left ) but an eerily similar clown that terrified residents of the @entity96 town of @entity97 last year turned out to be a college prank			1
at right is a still from video taken around the same time as the student 's @entity97 antics			1

the *demonic* - looking clown has been *spotted* for several days at train stations , banks and *hiding* behind trees in residential areas
residents have posted pictures of the clown on social media along with reactions that run from fear and *repulsion* to outright anger
a similar clown had residents of the @entity96 town of @entity97 calling police last year , but it turned out to be a *jokester* college student
