sightings of her date back to the sixth century and even in modern times , a glimpse of her still makes waves around the world			0
but it seems @entity9 is not the first monster to grace @entity12 waters after it emerged a long - lost relative may have been discovered			1
this monster lived 170 million years ago , not in @entity15 , but in a warm shallow sea around what is now the @entity18 and has been identified as a new species of ' ichthyosaur , ' a large dolphin - like marine reptile that grew up to 14 feet long from snout to tail			1
several of the fossils came from ichthyosaurs , including one previously unknown species , named ' @entity42			0
' @entity43 , pronounced ' jarkvara ' , is @entity44 for marine lizard			2
the name shawcrossi was chosen in honour of amateur fossil hunter @entity48 , who found the creature 's remains on @entity18 's @entity52 in 1959			1
throughout the @entity53 , much of @entity18 was under water			1
at the time , it was joined to the rest of the @entity57 and part of a large island positioned between landmasses that drifted apart to become @entity61 and @entity62			2
lead researcher dr @entity63 , from the @entity32 's @entity64 , said : ' during the time of dinosaurs , the waters of @entity12 were prowled by big reptiles the size of motor boats			0
@entity18 , above , is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the @entity74 can be found ' their fossils are very rare , and only now , for the first time , we 've found a new species that was uniquely @entity12			1
' without the generosity of the collector who donated the bones to a museum instead of keeping them or selling them , we would have never known that this amazing animal existed			0
we are honoured to name the new species after mr @entity48 and will do the same if any other collectors wish to donate new specimens			0
' a description of the creature appears in a study in the @entity93			0
@entity18 is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the @entity74 can be found and scientists believe discoveries made there could provide valuable insights into how marine reptiles evolved			1
dr @entity100 , from @entity101 , said : ' not only is this a very special discovery , but it also marks the beginning of a major new collaboration involving some of the most eminent palaeontologists in @entity12			2
the real @entity9 ? this famous picture appearing to show a creature rising from the water of @entity15 was taken by dr @entity110 in 1934 ' it has brought together key organisations , local collectors on @entity18 and specialists from further afield			1
' we are excited by the programme of work and are already working on additional new finds			0
this is a rich heritage for @entity12			0
' the work was carried out by a consortium involving the @entity32 , @entity101 , the @entity123 's @entity122 , @entity124 and @entity125 , @entity18			1
members of the research team , known as @entity128 , will be exhibiting the bones of @entity43 at a one - day fossil event at our dynamic @entity131 in @entity133 on sunday , 18 january from 10am - 4pm			2
@entity134 was reported to have seen @entity9 when preaching by the @entity135 in the sixth century , but the first modern sighting of her was in 1933 , when a man called @entity138 and his wife saw ' a most extraordinary form of animal ' cross the road in front of their car .			0

palaeontologists studied fossil fragments found on @entity18 over last 50 years
discovered evidence of large marine reptile 14ft long from snout to tail
throughout the @entity53 much of @entity18 was *underwater*
