@entity2 , 48 , kicked @entity3 , also 48 , once square in the face and twice more in the head , while the two were working as civilian merchant sailors on a vessel in the fleet which supports the @entity17			1
mr @entity3 lost a tooth , suffered a deep cut to his nose and was left with a black eye , while @entity2 was so drunk he was left with no memory of the attack			1
@entity2 was given a 10 - month suspended sentence at 200 hours of unpaid work at @entity26 today , and wept in the dock as the judgement was handed down for his ' stupid , stupid ' actions			1
the attack took place in july last year , at a time when the two men were working aboard @entity34 , a ship in the @entity36 , which was stationed in @entity37			2
both men were working as stores assistants in the supply and transport office of the naval department on board the vessel , which was described by the prosecution as a ' pressure cooker ' environment			0
the court heard that tensions had been brewing between the two for ' a considerable period of time ' on board the vessel , and that many other shipmates in fact found @entity2 ' annoying '			2
prosecutor @entity56 told the court : ' mr @entity3 and mr @entity2 were both employed by the @entity58 as civilian seamen on @entity36 ship , @entity34			1
' both men were working as stores assistants in the supply and transport office of the naval department on board the vessel			0
‘ there was a personality clash due to being in a confined space and they took a dislike to each other			0
' ‘ it seems the victim was sitting on a jetty on a raised curb when he was approached on his blind side by mr @entity2			2
‘ he then kicked him full force in the face , before that was followed by a second and third kick in the head			0
’ the court was told that mr @entity3 's injuries would have been much worse had @entity2 not been wearing soft canvas shoes at the time			1
@entity2 has since been sacked and was arrested on his return to @entity85			2
he pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding			1
he told police he had been provoked by mr @entity3 for a ‘ considerable period of time ’ but could n’t remember the attack due to being intoxicated			1
' pressure cooker ' : the assault took place while the two were working on the @entity95 , pictured , while it was in @entity37 last year in a statement , mr @entity3 said : ‘ when @entity2 first joined @entity34 , we got on ok but as time progress he started to annoy me because he was so loud and he used to tell awful jokes			1
‘ he just got on everyone ’s nerves , including mine			0
‘ as time went on , i did n’t like him and he did n’t like me			0
’ @entity2 has found himself in severe financial difficulties as a result of the brawl , which also contributed to the breakdown of his marriage			2
sentencing @entity2 to 10 months in prison , suspended for a year , and 200 hours unpaid work , judge @entity110 said : ‘ i want to make it absolutely plain that nothing i say to you should be taken to be a criticism of mr @entity3 in the sense that he was asking for it or deserved what happened to him			1
‘ you used a weapon - your foot with a shoe on it - and that ’s the equivalent of a weapon			2
‘ the fact that you had been taking drink when you did this explains it but does not excuse it , on the contrary it makes it worse			0
‘ but there is another side to this and there are many indications suggesting that you are a man of positive good character			0
‘ i accept that there was a background between you and mr @entity3			1
‘ i recognise that it was a stupid , stupid moment of loss of control on your part			0
‘ you attacked him and you must take responsibility for it , but the loss of your job has punished you to some extent already			0
’ @entity152 , defending @entity2 , told how he had an ‘ antagonistic ’ relationship with mr @entity3 , adding that his actions were ‘ very much out of character ’			1
‘ the two men were on the same vessel , it ’s the same working and living quarters and from mr @entity2 ’s point of view , there was no means of escape from what he felt was on - going torment			2
‘ his pride was dented by numerous comments being bandied about			0
‘ he makes no secret of the fact he ca n’t remember the incident but he accepts the witness ’ account and he is absolutely dismayed by his behaviour			0
‘ there is no getting away from the fact this has had a significant impact on his personal circumstances			0
