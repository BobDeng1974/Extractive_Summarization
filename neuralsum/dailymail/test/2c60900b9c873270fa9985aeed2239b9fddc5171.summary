@entity0 complained @entity1 should have been awarded a free - kick before the @entity4 defender conceded the penalty that allowed @entity6 to pinch a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity8			1
@entity4 manager @entity0 felt @entity1 had been barged by home striker @entity9 before the @entity11 right - back scooped away the ball with his hands			1
and @entity0 claimed referee @entity14 should have risen above the appeals from the @entity6 faithful and used ' common sense ' to rule in favour of @entity4			1
@entity1 falls over under the challenge from @entity9 and handles the ball @entity1 appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full - time whistle , but his manager says he was fouled @entity0 said on @entity24 1 : ' my thoughts are that straight away there is contact			1
@entity1 tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced			2
' sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense			0
' clearly there 's contact			0
i 've seen it many times given as a free - kick			0
' the whole action for me is too soft			0
i do n't think that there 's enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty			0
' he 's trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free - kick to be given			0
the @entity4 players protest but @entity14 deemed @entity1 's handball deliberate , and gave a penalty @entity52 made no mistake from the spot as the former @entity56 midfielder equalised for @entity6 ' it 's one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion			1
' you felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end			0
' @entity0 labelled the result ' a real disappointment ' , after @entity72 's first - half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points			2
@entity52 tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute			1
@entity0 added : ' the only criticism is we had a period of 10 , 15 , 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and did n't find that final shot or try to score the second goal , but apart from that i do feel the draw does n't reflect what happened			2
' @entity0 was clearly angry with the referee 's decision as his current side were held by his old club			2

@entity1 was penalised for handling in the penalty aread
@entity1 went down under *pressure* from @entity9
@entity0 *insisted* after the game his player had been pushed
@entity14 decided it was a penalty , which @entity52 *converted*
