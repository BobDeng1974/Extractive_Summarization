a man has been forced to sell his @entity2 ute by his wife because she 's pregnant and there 's no room for a baby seat			1
but @entity7 , 32 , managed to pen a hilarious but gloomy ad for the quirky offroader which has clocked 280,000km since it was first registered back in 1992			1
the dramatic @entity12 ad hails from the @entity13 , where mr @entity7 is advertising the vehicle under the orders of his wife @entity16			1
@entity7 has listed the 1992 @entity2 for $ 2,500 - but he says finding a buyer has been problematic because everyone thinks the advertisement is just a ' joke '			1
@entity21 has posted a dramatic ad on gumtree offering his 1992 @entity2 the hilarious advert is filled with melodramatic language , but mr @entity7 said the message rings true and that 's perhaps no surprise , given the ad is filled with dramatic language			1
' perhaps rather ironically , the cruelness of fatherhood is now set to callously deprive me of another 50 - 60 years of driving pleasure in this mighty beast , ' he writes			0
mr @entity7 describes how he has owned a string of other vehicles since then - a @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 - but that only his beloved @entity43 has ' faithfully and stoically remained by my side '			2
he said his wife @entity45 was expecting their second child at the time			2
' with only days before childbirth is due , ' the ad reads , ' my wife is getting a little frantic about irrelevant things			2
namely : ' why have n't you sold the brumby yet ? ? ' he even accuses her heart of ' icing over ' and claims she no longer understands the notion of sentimentality			0
@entity7 says his wife @entity45 ( pictured ) is insisting they sell their car since it can not offer a baby seat for their second child mr @entity7 said he has been approached by people on social media suggesting he ' keep the car and ditch the wife ' after listing the cars extensive usage - which includes 280,000km and a broken speedometer - @entity7 wrote ' yes she 's old and has some inevitable wear and tear , but is super reliable and clearly super cool			1
' mr @entity21 told @entity73 the ad has some sparked interest on social media			0
' some people have approached us on @entity79			0
they suggested i keep the car and ditch the wife			0
she naturally was n't too happy about that			0
' he said since the ute ca n't fit a baby seat in it , and since his wife has just given birth to their second child , the @entity43 is now obsolete as a family vehicle			1
' there has n't been a whole lot of prospective buyers for the car			0
maybe people think it 's a joke ? it 's a bit of a gag but the message rings true			2
the car needs to be sold			0
