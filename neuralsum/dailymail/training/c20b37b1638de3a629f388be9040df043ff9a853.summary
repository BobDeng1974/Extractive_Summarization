remember @entity1 ' incredible chip - in at the masters in 2005 and the will - it - or - wo n't - it pause before his ball dropped into the cup ? @entity5 seemed to stand still as @entity1 's @entity7 ball made its final revolution , and one of golf 's legendary moments was born			1
but if you thought that was a dramatic pause , it has nothing on @entity17 's putt at @entity18 last week			1
while @entity1 's ball hovered on the lip for a second or so , the 25 - year - old @entity19 had to wait a full 24 seconds for his ball to drop			1
but @entity17 's putt was quite remarkable			2
his 12 - foot birdie effort curled around the back of the cup on the 16th green at @entity18 before seemingly coming to a stop just millimetres from its intended target			2
but the ball was n't quite done yet			0
although it is hard to see on the tv footage , his ball was fractionally moving towards the cup all the time			0
the most dramatic of pauses : @entity1 holed an incredible chip - in at the masters in 2005 the rules of golf state that a moving ball must not be hit and so @entity17 , after a conversation with playing partner @entity67 , waited and urged his ball to complete its final roll			1
finally , it relented to gravity and fell in for a birdie two			0
with no need for jumping up and down or blowing on it either			0
eat your heart out , @entity1 .			0

@entity19 @entity17 hit a putt which stayed on edge of the hole for 24 seconds before falling into the cup
@entity19 was playing in the @entity26 at @entity18
shot brings back memories of @entity1 's chip - in at the masters in 2005
