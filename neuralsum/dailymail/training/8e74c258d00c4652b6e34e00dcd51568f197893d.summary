by @entity0 a couple living off food grown in their back garden have become embroiled in a legal battle - because the allotment ' violates planning laws '			1
@entity8 , 26 , and her partner @entity9 , 29 , bought the disused plot of land behind their home from @entity15 council in 2010			1
reminiscent of the lifestyle on tv sitcom @entity19 , they have eaten produce grown on the land , including potatoes , onions and eggs , for four years			1
@entity19 ? @entity25 , @entity9 , and their two sons @entity28 and @entity29 live off the food grown in their allotment in @entity33 , @entity34 - but @entity35 claims it is a violation of planning laws garden : they bought the house in 2010 because it was next to a disused plot of land , which they also bought however , they have been threatened with ' enforcement action ' and a warning to demolish the wooden chicken run , shed and vegetable patch			1
in a letter from the council , bosses said the couple , who have two children , were not allowed to use the land as a ' garden ' - despite selling the plot as ' a private garden '			1
sparking a £ 1,000 legal battle , the council added that the family could apply for retrospective planning permission but that the council would recommend refusal			1
ms @entity25 said : ' when we got the letter it was totally out of the blue			1
i ca n’t tell you how shocked we were			0
we had just that morning gone out to by wood to build an aviary			0
' we wanted the house because of that plot of land so we could live off it			2
we are into rearing chickens and we wanted to teach our children the value of self - sufficiency			2
' every document sent to us when we were purchasing this land said it was to be used as a private garden			2
' we now grow everything from cabbage , beans , salad and beetroot			0
so much love , money and of course time goes into that land			0
livestock : as well as growing potatoes and beetroot , the family keep hens and geese in their back garden warning : mr @entity9 and ms @entity25 were told to demolish their vegetable patches , shed and chicken coop conflict : the enforcement order came three years after the couple bought the land as a ' private garden ' ' even when i was pregnant with my first boy i was out there digging and planting			1
' finally , after a petition from the entire village of @entity33 supporting them , the family has been allowed to continue living ' the @entity114 '			1
ms @entity25 said : ' we ’re very relieved but it never should have come to this in the first place			2
' if they had taken the land away from us they would have taken away our food source and all the money and hours of labour and love invested in that garden			2
' we had to borrow the money from @entity9 ’s parents to fight this thing			2
we do n’t have £ 1,000 lying about just to give away at a moment ’s notice			1
' we wanted to teach our children the value of self - sufficiency ' ' councillors at the meeting kept saying it was ridiculous that this had happened			0
one councillor , usually a staunch protector of green belt land , even said there was no other conclusion to come to			0
' the couple bought their house in 2010 because of the council plot next door - following the example of @entity148 and @entity149 in tv sitcom @entity19			1
they then bought the land the following year for £ 10,000 with a contract stating ' the land not to be used for any purpose other than as a private garden '			1
the couple spent £ 30,000 turning the unkempt and overgrown land into a self - sustainable private garden and play area for their two children , @entity29 and @entity162			1
mr @entity9 erected a wall around the site , security alarms in the chicken coops and grew potatoes to soften the soil			2
they currently grow various vegetables in their garden including potatoes , onions , cabbage and beetroot			0
they also keep chickens and geese - guarded by two @entity179 dogs and two cats			0
however , in february , planning enforcement officers contacted the family warning them the changes to the land were in breach of the @entity186			0
building : the couple spent £ 30,000 building a shed and chicken coop so they could save on grocery spend relief : after a village - wide petition , they have been allowed to continue living @entity19 one neighbour of the couple , who has lived in the area for 20 years , signed the petition , writing : ' i do n’t believe there have been any objections to their plans and feel it would be a travesty and lacking in human kindness if small - print and red tape were to cut short their dream			1
' other neighbours commended the couple ’s efforts to turn the ‘ old dumping ground for fly tippers ’ into a ‘ green ’ environment at their own expense			0
and local @entity217 councillor @entity216 said the situation was ' absolutely barmy '			0
today a @entity35 planning spokesman said : ' this plot lies within the @entity221 and therefore any change of its use or anything that is erected on the site requires planning permission			0
' however , the @entity227 decided that special circumstances justified granting permission for the owners to erect a greenhouse and use it as a garden , especially since it had been used as such for many years			0
' @entity233 did stipulate that it could at no time be used as a separate , independent unit			0

@entity25 and @entity9 bought land from council in 2010
*inspired* by @entity19 , they feed their two sons with home - grown food
this year , council *accused* them of ' *annexing* ' plot , ordered them to demolish
sparked £ 1,000 battle and petition from entire village of @entity33 , @entity34
