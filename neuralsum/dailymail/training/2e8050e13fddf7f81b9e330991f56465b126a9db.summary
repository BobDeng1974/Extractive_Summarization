by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 21 november 2013 president @entity1 and @entity3 governor @entity2 were n't the only ones in the line of fire on that fateful day in 1963 - a 27 - year - old car salesman standing 531 feet away was also wounded			1
@entity8 , known as ' the accidental victim , ' has recounted the moment he felt something ' sting me in the face ' after he heard what he first thought was a firecracker explode at @entity16			1
the now - 77 - year - old was barely aware the president was in town until traffic stopped in front of him near the @entity16 's triple underpass			1
already late for a lunch date , he stepped out of his car to see what was going on			0
' and i 'm thinking , " what kind of idiot would be throwing a firecracker with the president going by ? " course , that was the first shot			1
then the crack , crack , quick shots in a row , and something stings me in the face			0
' @entity8 said he was hit with pieces of concrete when a bullet intended for @entity1 missed the president 's limousine and struck the curbside a few feet away from him			1
the wound was so superficial that he did n't even know he 'd been hit			2
he said he and a deputy sheriff were trying to work out what had happened			0
' we walked across the street just in time to hear this man sobbing , " his head exploded			0
his head exploded , " ' @entity8 told the station			1
' and the policeman said , ' who 's head ? ' and he said , ' the president 's			2
' " far away : the car salesman was barely aware the president was in town until traffic stopped in front of him near the @entity16 's triple underpass and he got out to see what was going on			1
he is pictured in a grainy image above same spot : the 77 - year - old stands in the same spot this week , 50 years on the deputy then pointed out the blood on his face			1
' and that 's when i remembered something had stung me in the face			0
and i reached up , and there was three or four drops of blood on my hand , ' he said			0
@entity8 was eventually taken to police headquarters to provide a statement and told @entity36 that while he was waiting , @entity90 was brought in for questioning			2
@entity8 's wounds did not require medical care and were only touched on in the initial media reports			2
however , six months later his story was picked up by @entity95 and investigators examined the ricocheting bullet			0
until that point , authorities believed all three shots had struck the president and governor @entity2			1
' they had to go back and rewrite the @entity104 , ' he said			0
' that 's where the magic bullet came from			0
that 's the only thing they could come up with			0
that one bullet went through two people			0
' @entity112 @entity113 curbside : the piece of curbstone that was hit by the bullet that then struck @entity8 was removed , pictured , and taken to the @entity118 in @entity119 at that point , @entity8 started doing his own research on the assassination			1
but he found that the piece of curbstone that was hit by the bullet that then struck him had been removed and taken to the @entity118 in @entity119			1
@entity8 has spent more than three decades researching the shooting and believes @entity1 was killed by a team of hit men hired by then - vice president @entity128			1
' finding this was no big deal , it 's like a crossword puzzle â€” you just got to start putting the pieces together , ' @entity8 told @entity134			2
' @entity1 's assassination was not a conspiracy , it was a coup			2
' but despite this firm belief , @entity8 still finds it hard to discuss what he observed that day			1
' i have never found the right words to describe it			0
it 's like it happened in a movie or something , ' @entity8 told @entity134			0
' fifty years later , i still have n't fully accepted that he was killed right in front of me			0
