by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 06:10 est , 26 july 2013 @entity2 49ers cornerback @entity1 has lost out on $ 2million it was perhaps the most costliest skipping of the gym in history			1
@entity6 cornerback @entity1 has forfeited $ 2million of his base salary after he failed to attend his team 's voluntary off - season workouts			1
by not reading the small print , the @entity11 player lost the cash because he did not turn up to exercise with the rest of the team - and he has now fired his agent over the costly blunder			1
@entity1 , 28 , said he normally trains alone in his home state of @entity19 ; but did not realize that by working out there instead of in @entity22 , his salary would plunge to $ 925,000			1
the detail in the contract stated that the off - season workouts would have triggered an escalator in his deal , @entity23 reported			2
but the athlete said he was unaware of the clause , and only discovered his error when he read a @entity33 article about it on @entity35 yesterday			1
the cornerback , who played college football for the @entity39 , immediately fired his agent , @entity40 , @entity36 reported			1
@entity1 explained his decision to fire his agent , saying that it was @entity40 's responsibility to inform the player about details in his contract , the @entity46 reported			1
' that 's what agents get paid to do – to orchestrate the contract and let you know what you can and ca n’t do as far as workouts , @entity55 , things of that sort , ' @entity1 said			2
' that ’s what he got paid to do			0
he did n’t do that			0
so , in my opinion , you have to be let go			0
' we all are held accountable for our actions and it ’s just part of the business			0
' @entity69 have come to @entity22 : because the athlete was working out in @entity19 , he missed out on a clause which would have triggered a pay increase @entity1 ( right ) said he did n't know about that clause in the deal and only learned of it via @entity35 @entity40 was unavailable to comment when the @entity76 tried to contact him			1
@entity1 said he had no problem with working out , but had routinely returned home to prepare himself for the next season , @entity36 reported			2
' it 's something i 've always done as far as off - season at home and training and getting myself in shape			0
' it had nothing to do with not being in shape , not wanting to work out , no contract problems , it just had to do with me wanting to go back home and train			0
' it 's something i 've been doing for the past few years			0
' he had been set to earn $ 2.925 million this season in base salary after signing a three - year , $ 7.125 million extension in 2009			1
the 49ers selected @entity1 in the fifth round of the @entity96			2
he is involved in two foundations to help others			0
one is the ' @entity99 ' , which aims to improve the quality of life for disadvantaged youth while creating an environment of care and support in areas of education , reduction of poverty and disparity			0
the other the ' @entity112 ' , which strives the to restore the lives of ex-offenders returning to society , and provide preventative methods to reduce recidivism of ex-offenders , by offering them alternative solutions and a chance at independence and self - sufficiency by ' making a positive transition to a new life			0

@entity1 lost $ 2million because he did not attend workout
@entity128 had worked out in @entity19 , not with his team in @entity22
fired agent @entity40 who he *claimed* did not tell him about clause
will now earn $ 925,000 because he did not know about small print
