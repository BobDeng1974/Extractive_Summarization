but cerebral palsy sufferer @entity0 will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to @entity5 readers			1
the three - year - old was denied @entity7 funding last year for the surgery at the same @entity12 hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model @entity13 breast enlargements			1
and even when readers raised £ 55,000 to pay for @entity0 ’s surgery her family were told by @entity7 doctors she was ‘ not disabled enough ’ to qualify – despite not being able to walk			1
but the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon dr @entity20 in the @entity23 this autumn			0
it means that , by the time she is four , @entity0 could be walking			2
@entity0 was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy			1
she needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery , which involves cutting the nerves in her spine , to be able to walk freely			2
@entity0 has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially - adapted £ 1,200 bicycle bought from readers ’ donations			1
doctors said this means she is an ‘ ideal candidate ’ for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards			2
@entity0 ’s mother @entity40 , 41 , a nurse , said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved			0
she said : ‘ @entity0 wiped my face and she said “ @entity47 why are you crying ? ” i told her she was going to be able to walk and she said “ yes ! ”			2
‘ by the time she is four she could be walking			0
it ’s very , very emotional , we just ca n’t believe it			0
‘ it is frustrating that @entity12 turned us down but now we know that @entity0 is going to have the best surgeon , so that is more reassuring			1
if anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her			0
‘ as it gets nearer i ’m sure the nerves will kick in - it ’s a big operation			0
but it ’s what she needs and it ’s the best thing for her			0
‘ @entity0 understands now that she is going to walk			2
she knows dr @entity69 will “ fix her legs ” and she knows she is going on a big plane to get there			0
’ the three - year - old was denied @entity7 funding last year for the surgery , but she has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon dr @entity20 in the @entity23 @entity0 ’s mother @entity40 , 41 , a nurse , said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved			1
she said : ‘ if it was n’t for the @entity5 we would n’t be where we are now ' mrs @entity0 said @entity0 had progressed to standing up on her own since using the bike bought from readers ’ funds , which meant doctors had told her they were ‘ confident ’ she would be able to walk after surgery			1
she added : ‘ if it was n’t for the @entity5 we would n’t be where we are now , we just ca n’t thank everyone enough			0
