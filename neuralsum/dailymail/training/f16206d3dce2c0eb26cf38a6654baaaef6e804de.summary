by @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 17 july 2013 older people on the hunt for a romantic relationship are increasingly finding it while travelling abroad , new research has revealed			2
one in five senior travellers say they would be more likely to contemplate having a holiday romance now than when they were younger and a tenth have admitted to having an exotic fling already			1
a small minority even admitted to planning their holidays based purely on their chances of finding love while away			2
romance : older travellers are now just as likely to find love while abroad as their younger counterparts the look of love : @entity19 starred as @entity20 in the 1989 film about an older lady who finds romance while on holiday in @entity25 although holiday romances have traditionally been the preserve of teenagers and twenty - somethings , older people are no strangers to the concept			1
along with films such as @entity20 , in which a middle - aged @entity33 housewife finds life - changing love while on holiday in @entity25 , there have been numerous reports of marriages arising from older unions - although they have n't always ended happily			1
among them was @entity41 , now 61 , who married a @entity43 waiter 35 years her junior only to discover that his real interest was in gaining a @entity47 visa			0
perhaps that is why the poll , conducted by over- 50s travel insurance provider @entity51 , also found that 61 per cent of those indulging in holiday romances would n't tell their friends about it			0
a lack of a long term future was another reason cited , with half of mature holidaymakers saying that although relationships often continued after arriving home , the majority lasted only a few weeks			0
@entity66 @entity67 @entity25 @entity68 @entity70 / @entity69 nevertheless , almost a quarter of the over- 50s questioned said that they knew somebody who had met their husband or wife on holiday			1
despite the pitfalls , holidays are seen as a good route to romantic success , according to 60 per cent of mature travellers , although almost half ended up with a @entity47 man or woman			2
just 15 per cent chose to strike up a relationship with one of the locals			0
@entity89 , chief executive at @entity90 , said : ' for over- 50 's holidaymakers , whether they are single and going on holiday to find love , or married couples having second honeymoons , romance is increasingly on the cards			1
' our research shows that one in five know someone who has met their partner on holiday			0
while this is heartwarming we do urge people to err on the side of caution as their own personal safety should be the number one priority			0

one fifth of mature travellers would like to find love abroad
one in ten say they have already enjoyed a holiday romance
