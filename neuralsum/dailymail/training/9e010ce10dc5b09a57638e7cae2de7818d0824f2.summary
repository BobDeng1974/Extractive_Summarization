people say it ’s only the @entity2 , but this could be one of the games of the season			1
there is a @entity8 final at stake and the bigger picture to think about			0
if @entity12 win , they move on and can take a big step towards the title if they beat @entity15 on saturday and a @entity17 win could inspire the rest of their season			1
@entity21 ( left ) posted an @entity23 picture of him and @entity24 on the train to @entity26 the @entity17 players will be hoping to continue their resurgent form against @entity12 on tuesday night how @entity29 it @entity31 reverted to type at @entity32			1
he loves being the underdog and tends to be more defensive in the big games , but playing @entity37 as an extra midfield shield has not worked			0
this @entity12 team is just not built to play defensively			2
for @entity31 attack is definitely the best form of defence			0
it does n’t take a rocket scientist to see @entity17 ’s weakness is at the back , and i fully expect @entity31 to name his strongest team on tuesday night			2
as we saw at @entity51 , when they are let off the leash , they are almost unstoppable			0
when @entity12 are let off the leash , they are almost unstoppable - attack is the best form of defence how @entity17 @entity29 after letting in five at @entity59 and four against @entity60 , there will be doubts creeping into the minds of @entity12 players and fans alike			1
@entity17 must prey on that			2
they will have to be patient but their system caused @entity12 problems last week			0
@entity68 was rested on saturday so should start and i ’d like to see him playing in an advanced role again			0
if he and @entity71 can keep @entity72 occupied , then that might tempt @entity74 or @entity75 to step out and deal with him , as our pitch map shows			1
if that happens , that leaves @entity80 with a one - on - one situation			2
after the way he played last week , that is the last thing @entity12 will want			0
@entity17 must try and occupy @entity12 defenders to get @entity80 into one - on - one situations @entity74 & @entity75 v @entity80 @entity80 terrorised these two in the first leg and took his goal so well			1
he is one of the fastest players in the league and if @entity17 can get their main man driving at the heart of the @entity12 defence , then they are in with a real chance			1
@entity72 v @entity68 & @entity71 @entity72 is the solid foundation on which @entity12 build all their attacks , but he will not be getting much help from @entity99			1
@entity72 ca n’t be in two places at once and if @entity17 ’s midfield men can isolate him , they will be able to find spaces either side to try and open up their opponents			2
@entity68 and @entity71 could hold the key in isolating @entity72 at @entity107 @entity109 v @entity108 he might not get praised like some of his team - mates , but @entity109 is a silent assassin			1
if i were facing @entity12 , he is the one i would be most scared of			0
he sparks much of @entity12 ’s best work and because of their forward players ’ fluid movement , you ca n’t mark man for man			0
that ’s why @entity108 has such an important role			0
@entity109 is @entity12 's silent assassin , he sparks much of @entity12 's best work @entity108 will have a tricky task in trying to mark his fellow @entity124 on tuesday night			1

@entity12 host @entity17 in their @entity2 *semi-final* second leg
first leg at @entity32 finished 1 - 1 after @entity80 *equaliser*
@entity80 could hold the key for the @entity134 *...* if @entity72 is occupied
@entity108 will have a tough job trying to keep @entity109 at *bay*
@entity107 *clash* could be one of the games of the season
