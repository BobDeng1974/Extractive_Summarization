by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 18:35 est , 1 march 2013 a leading paparazzo who has photographed many of the world 's biggest celebrities has been shot dead in @entity5			1
@entity6 was found with a single bullet in his head , prompting fears he had fallen victim to a @entity12 - style execution			1
the 42 - year - old photographer was discovered lying face down in a pool of blood in the @entity18 district in the southwest of @entity5 on a cycling track where he regularly went jogging			1
his body was apparently found by friends with whom he had previously arranged to go running			1
killed : @entity6 was found dead in @entity5 , @entity25 , on thursday with a gunshot to the head killed : paparazzo @entity6 was found with a bullet in his head in a busy street in @entity5 stars who have been photographed by @entity6 include @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
he also snapped designers @entity36 and @entity38 on their yacht			1
but perhaps his biggest hit came when he snapped pictures in @entity42 of @entity43 with a female assistant , which were said to have angered the actor 's fiancée @entity46			1
an officer attached to the investigation said : ' he was killed with a single shot from a small calibre weapon			1
' it could be he fell foul of a @entity12 crime family or someone else who really did n't want their picture taken			1
' at work : @entity59 travelled the world taking photots and was best known for his shots of @entity43 with another woman targets : stars who were photographed by @entity6 included @entity43 and @entity34 a police spokesman added : ' @entity6 was a well - known paparazzo photographer and his scoops embarrassed many people			1
' we are not ruling out a connection between his work and his death , and we are looking through all his most recent assignments as well as phone and computer records			1
' there is no suggestion that any of his celebrity subjects is in any way linked to his death			1
five years ago , @entity6 was apparently attacked by arsonists who burned his car and threatened his family			2
and just last month a colleague of his at photo agency @entity88 , @entity89 , died in a mysterious motorcycle crash			2
the word ' paparazzi ' originates from the 1960 film @entity94 , directed by @entity95			2
the film , starring @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , is set in @entity5 during a period when obsession with celebrity was at a new all - time high in @entity25			2
all the famous actresses of the day , from @entity105 to @entity106 , would be spotted out and about in the city and pictured by a waiting mass of photographers			2
@entity94 follows a struggling journalist 's week in the glamorous @entity112 city and features a news photographer named @entity6 , played by @entity114			2
it is this character that helped coin the term ' paparazzi ' for freelance photographers			0
director @entity95 is believed to have come up with the name for the character from an @entity122 dialect word ' papataceo ' that describes the buzzing of a mosquito			0
in an interview with @entity126 , @entity95 said : ' paparazzo … suggests to me a buzzing insect , hovering , darting , stinging			0
' but other accounts claim @entity95 took the name from a character in the 1901 novel , by the @entity133			0
the film @entity94 - which translates as ' the sweet life ' - also left another legacy , making the phrase synonymous around the world for ' living the good life ' or ' high life '			0
a character in the hit film @entity94 - a photographer called @entity6 who was played by @entity114 - is responsible for helping to coin the term paparazzi this phrase would have been commonplace in @entity122 - speaking countries prior to 1960 but only became part of the @entity149 language after the release of the popular film			0
the film received 20 minutes of applause when a rough edit was shown and won the @entity155 at the 1960 @entity156			0
but @entity94 is still mostly remembered for creating @entity6 , which by the late 1960s had entered @entity149 as a generic term for intrusive photographers			0
the @entity161 dictionary describes a paparazzo as : ' a freelance photographer who pursues celebrities to get photographs of them '			0
and a person who has been photographed by the @entity167 is said to have been ' papped '			0
when @entity94 was made , photographers were paid around $ 500 per photo			0
today , the figure for an exclusive picture of a high - profile celebrity can be limitless .			0
