en route : the helicopter carrier @entity24 departing @entity25 yesterday taking the case to the @entity27 would mark the first time @entity2 has taken a fellow @entity19 nation to court			1
the plans emerged as a @entity33 taskforce , including the aircraft carrier @entity24 and two frigates , set sail for @entity7			1
the journey is part of a long - planned exercise – but government officials say the show of force may help ‘ focus minds ’ in @entity5			2
@entity2 ’s ambassador @entity44 , brother of @entity46 presenter @entity45 , informed the @entity5 of the intention to go to court yesterday afternoon			1
government lawyers were last night deciding whether to lodge a case with the @entity27 , or call for the @entity51 to take action itself ; senior sources told the @entity55 that mr @entity4 demanded answers from the @entity11 ‘ by the end of the day ’			1
unprecedented : prime minister @entity4 is threatening @entity58 with legal action over delays at the @entity5 - @entity7 border he is expected to consult with the attorney general @entity62 today , and could make a formal announcement tomorrow			1
officials are also drafting plans for political retaliation to hit @entity5 interests if @entity58 fails to back down			1
ministers believe the @entity5 have engineered the controversy to distract attention from the parlous state of its economy , and a corruption scandal engulfing the govern a @entity76 spokesman said : ‘ clearly the prime minister is disappointed by the failure of @entity5 to remove the additional border checks this weekend			1
we are now considering what legal action is open to us			1
this would be an unprecedented step so we want to consider it carefully			0
’ exhausting : drivers wait in the sweltering heat to enter @entity5 , after the @entity5 authorities increased border checks at the border with @entity7 they said the action by the @entity5 was ‘ politically motivated and totally disproportionate ’ , and illegal under @entity19 law			1
ment of prime minister @entity92			0
a @entity94 source added : ‘ we ’re also exploring whether there are other political options we could pursue to make clear to the @entity5 that the issue is putting our bilateral relations at risk , and persuade them to de-escalate the issue			2
’ the @entity51 said it will send monitors to the border to assess the situation – but sources said these monitors would not arrive until next month at the earliest , because they are on holiday			0
the stand - off began when the government of @entity7 started building an artificial reef in the waters off the @entity113 last month to deter @entity5 fishermen , who were damaging the marine environment			2
@entity5 responded by imposing draconian border checks , and threatening to slap tolls on travellers and ban @entity7 - bound flights from @entity5 air space			1
@entity5 media reports suggested that the case could be taken to the @entity123 , with @entity5 and @entity124 joining forces to demand sovereignty over @entity7 and the @entity127			2
@entity5 foreign minister @entity128 will sound out his @entity124 counterpart , @entity129 , at a meeting in @entity131 next month			2

‘ we are not worried because we are convinced about what we are doing , and we know that the right is on our side , ’ he said , adding that it was ‘ normal ’ that @entity5 would talk with @entity124 about @entity7 and the @entity127			2
@entity5 wants @entity2 to hand over @entity7 – but it has no intention of letting go of @entity143 and @entity144 , two enclaves it holds on the coast of @entity147			2
the tiny territories on the @entity3 are the subjects of a long - standing dispute with @entity151			2
while @entity2 calls @entity7 an overseas territory , @entity5 claims that the cities are actually part of mainland @entity5			0
@entity5 officials say their historical claim on the areas predates the modern country of @entity151 , and so refuse to give them up			0
like @entity7 , they are duty - free havens that attract smugglers			0
@entity161 , the regional president of @entity144 , stressed that @entity7 is classified as a ‘ non-self - governing territory ’ by the @entity123 , meaning its status is discussed by the @entity164 on @entity165 , while @entity151 has done nothing to include @entity144 and @entity143 on that list			0
@entity168 , a 30 - year - old born in @entity143 , said : ‘ we are as @entity5 as people from @entity58 or @entity171			0
’ however , she added : ‘ i do feel sympathy with the people of @entity7			0
so what if our land is at the tip of another country ? i think the politicians should just leave things alone and let us get on with our lives peacefully			0
’ ten @entity2 vessels with a capacity of 3,000 personnel have headed to the waters off @entity7			0
the frigate @entity186 and two support vessels will call in at the @entity2 base at @entity7 for three days , beginning on august 19			0
longstanding @entity5 rules mean that once they call at the @entity113 they can not sail directly to any @entity5 sea port			1
@entity192 mayor @entity191 said the deployment should send a clear signal to the @entity5			0
‘ perhaps it really is a coincidence – as the @entity11 claims – that we have just sent a fleet of warships to @entity7 , ’ he said			0
‘ but i hope not			0
