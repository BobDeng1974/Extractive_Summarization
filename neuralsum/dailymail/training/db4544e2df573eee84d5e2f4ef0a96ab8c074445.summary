but which weight - loss plans actually work ? a new survey suggests the most successful dieters reach for their smartphones			1

calorie - counting apps like myfitnesspal provide an easy way for dieters to keep track of their progress while @entity53 is still the people 's choice , chosen by four out of 10 @entity12 ' readers , its scoring on satisfaction was not as impressive as @entity25 , achieving 74 out of 100			1
however , it did receive the highest score for a commercial diet plan			1
' we were fascinated by the results because satisfaction scores did not correlate well with actual weight loss , ' said @entity65 , senior program editor at @entity12 , which is a non-profit organisation			1
the @entity12 survey revealed ... dieters should keep expectations in check			0
medical consultants say that dieters often overestimate how much weight they can lose tracking calories and physical activity helps maintain motivation			0
this was used by 87 % of @entity25 users use all the tools available on a plan			1
@entity53 members felt more satisfied and lost more weight if they went to meetings compared to those who followed the diet online consumers preferred diets that helped them maintain weight loss and prescribed easy - to - make lifestyle changes some diets on the @entity12 ' list were built around restricting major categories of food , such as @entity91			1
of these the @entity92 was best - liked ' you can lose on any diet plan if it works for you , but it seems that dieters balance weight loss against other factors such as the extent to which a diet is sustainable or easy to follow			1
' in the commercial category , @entity102 got the second highest satisfaction score ( 70 ) , followed by @entity105 ( 66 ) and @entity106 ( 56 )			1
in terms of initial weight loss , @entity102 was the only commercial plan to receive an above average rating			1

this was followed by the @entity119 ( 77 ) and @entity120 ( 76 ) which is an app and website			0
the results of the survey reflect the broadening landscape of diets that subscribers reported using			0
' the rapid emergence of new apps to help dieters crunch numbers and stay on top of their calories and exercise regimens is clearly having an enormous impact that our new methodology was able to capture , ' said @entity65			0
in 2011 , the last time @entity12 rated diets , it based the ratings on the results of clinical trials and a nutritional analysis			0
the report , in next month 's copy of @entity12 , notes that readers gave high marks to the diets that helped them maintain weight loss and that prescribed lifestyle changes that were easy to make			2
aerobic exercise is better for weight loss than resistance training such as using weights , a study shows			2
the largest trial carried out to compare the two found that aerobic exercise - low intensity workouts which exercise the heart - was more effective than anaerobic , such as short springs and weight training			2
it was particularly true where time constraints were an issue , reports the @entity167			0
the authors say ‘ it may be time to seriously reconsider the conventional wisdom ’ that resistance training , which helps build muscle , is best for weight loss			2
the team studied 234 previously sedentary overweight or obese people aged 18 - 70 , who were enrolled in one of three eight - month supervised training programmes : aerobic training ( at ) , resistance training ( rt ) , or a combination ( at / rt )			2
those assigned to aerobic training exercised vigorously , at about 70 - 85 per cent of maximum heart rate , for 45 minutes three days per week throughout the study period			0
those doing weight training also exercised three days a week , completing three sets of 8 - 12 reps on eight resistance machines that targeted all major muscle groups			2
the third group did both sets of exercise			0
at the end of the study , the only people who had not lost weight were the resistance trainers , who actually gained weight due to an increase in lean body mass. those who did aerobic exercise saw their waist circumference and fat mass significantly decrease			2
lead author @entity207 , from @entity209 's @entity208 , said : ‘ given our observations , it may be time to seriously reconsider the conventional wisdom that resistance training alone can lead to weight and fat loss			0
