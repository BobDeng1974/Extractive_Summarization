by @entity0 @entity1 , what were you thinking ? while the rest of the royal party sensibly opted for a muted palette , determined not to outshine the woman at the centre of it all , the @entity4 opted for a scarlet dress so bold and bright it just screamed : ‘ look at me ! ’ for a moment , she could have been confused with the @entity15 ’ guard of honour			1
but , no , it was @entity1 in an outfit as striking as it was inappropriate			1
lady in red : @entity22 of @entity23 cut a swathe through the gloomy weather this afternoon as she stepped on to the @entity26 wearing a vibrant scarlet @entity29 dress - on her lapel , @entity1 wore a maritime - themed brooch featuring two silver dolphins			1
it 's a gift from the @entity33 of which @entity34 is @entity35 in chief all eyes on them : members of the @entity39 ( from left to right ) the @entity4 , prince @entity40 , @entity41 , prince @entity42 , @entity43 , prince @entity34 and prince @entity44 on the @entity45 royal arrival : the @entity47 and @entity4 walked past a row of magnificently dressed @entity15 before boarding the boat and waved to the assembled crowds lining the river arriving at the river : the @entity47 and @entity4 and prince @entity44 , prepare to board the spirit of @entity54 yes , it drew gasps from the crowd , but that was precisely the problem			1
for if ever there was an occasion when @entity1 should have opted for a more subdued look , then this was surely it			1
throughout her first year as a member of the @entity39 , @entity1 has hardly put a fashionably shod foot wrong			1
her wedding gown was tremblingly beautiful and sophisticated			2
since then she has cleverly combined @entity67 with designer clothes : fashionable but never a fashionista , classic , conservative , sometimes demure			2
so why , on the second most important occasion in her public life , did she opt for an outfit more suited to @entity73 ’ day at @entity74 alongside @entity75 than beside her majesty at her @entity77 ? an outfit , indeed , that in its sleeveless version was previously worn by reality tv star @entity80 and @entity82 judge @entity81			0
royal trio : prince @entity44 , the @entity4 and prince @entity84 as they pass the houses of @entity87 aboard the royal barge time to talk : @entity22 of @entity23 meets well wishers before boarding th spirit of @entity54 private joke : @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity91 shares a laugh with @entity93 of @entity94 keeping cover : @entity22 opted for a large red umbrella as rain continued to fall it says something when even @entity100 and @entity101 were more appropriately attired than the usually immaculate @entity1			1
not the @entity104 , but the @entity105			0
apparently , the @entity107 women , now a bewildering presence at all royal occasions , had decided to do a ‘ red , white and blue ’ theme between sisters and mother , with @entity113 in white , @entity114 in blue and @entity1 in crimson			1
put together , they no doubt looked like a jolly string of bunting			0
but , for heaven ’s sake , this was n’t a promotional shoot for their online party business , it was a formal royal function			2
family loyalty is one thing , @entity1 , but you ’re part of a much bigger , more important family now			1
de-ja vu : @entity22 of @entity23 's @entity29 dress has previously been worn in sleeveless form by @entity80 , left , and @entity81 , right , though 5ft 10in @entity1 had her version made longer to suit the occasion i realise it must be incredibly difficult to have the eyes of the world upon her and every outfit scrutinised			1
but she is clever enough to know by now what impact her choice of outfit can have on a public occasion ; how every little detail can speak volumes			0
she also has the best advisers in the land , not least the @entity39 themselves			0
unlike with @entity148 , they have done everything to make her feel part of the family and to help her understand what is required of her			0
@entity1 ’s advisers have always let it be known that she and @entity34 wanted to be low - key royals			1
we were told they wanted a quiet , normal , married life while they were based in a small cottage in @entity160			0
if so , then yesterday was a curious way of showing it			0
let us be charitable and assume it was never @entity1 ’s intention to steal the limelight from the @entity43 , and she was simply badly advised			2
but there ’s a lesson in there for her			0
yes , she looked stunning			0
but when in the @entity43 ’s company , less is definitely more			0
ultimately , nothing — not even a scarlet @entity4 — could outshine our diamond sovereign			2
but please , @entity1 , if you ’re planning a sexy pink number for the service of thanksgiving tomorrow — think again ! have you taken any pictures of the @entity176 celebrations ? from the @entity177 to your town , we want to see them			2
send them for publication to the @entity182 on the email address : @entity183			0

wore a bright red @entity29 dress , topped off with a *flamboyant* red hat by @entity187 from royal *milliner* @entity188
@entity1 was carrying a scarf made of @entity192 - a *nod* to her @entity195 title the @entity4
