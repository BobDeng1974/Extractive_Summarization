controversial ' pick up artist ' @entity0 has posted a domestic abuse chart on his @entity4 page calling it a ' checklist ' for ' how to make her stay '			1
the diagram was originally designed by a domestic abuse charity to help women identify when they are being abused , and has sections entitled ' use male privilege ' and ' use isolation '			1
the post , which has now been hidden online , came as minister @entity15 urged home secretary @entity16 to ban @entity0 from coming to @entity17			1
@entity24 - born @entity0 was forced to cut a visit to @entity36 short due to widespread protests at his dating techniques , which include choking women , threatening to commit suicide , injuring their pets and isolating them from friends			1
crime minister ms @entity15 said : ' i am extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements @entity0 has made about women			1
' if he was allowed to perform in the @entity17 i have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase			2
' free speech is obviously hugely important , but with free speech comes responsibility			0
it is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances			0
' shadow home secretary @entity57 has also called for mr @entity0 to be barred from the @entity17 , saying his Â£ 2,000 - a - head seminar is not ' conducive to public good '			1
@entity0 's ' techniques ' for picking up women includes choking them ( pictured ) , injuring their pets , threatening to commit suicide , and isolating them from their friends @entity0 had to cut his recent trip to @entity36 short after widespread protests demanding that he leave mr @entity0 has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an ' executive coach ' at a company called @entity71 , which he calls an ' international leader in dating advice '			2
it promises customers the chance to ' witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations '			0
but videos and pictures of @entity0 in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them			2
a video of one of his seminar in @entity92 shows him saying that ' white men ... can do what you want ' in @entity96 , suggesting that men grab women 's heads and thrust them towards their crotch			0
@entity99 , from the @entity100 , said : ' his so - called pick up coaching promotes behaviour amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault			0
crime minister @entity15 and shadow home secretary @entity57 have both called on @entity105 to block @entity0 from being allowed entry to the @entity17 ' more broadly , he is part of a culture which trivialises abuse of women and racism			1
at worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them does n't matter , and gives potential abusers the nod that such behaviour will not be taken seriously			0
' a @entity120 spokesman said : ' all visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules			0
' the home secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the @entity17 is not conducive to the public good			0
