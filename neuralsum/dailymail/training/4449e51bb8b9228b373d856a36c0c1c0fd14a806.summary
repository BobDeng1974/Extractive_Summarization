it was in a radio interview in november when @entity3 coach @entity2 , tired of managers pushing their players under his nose saying he should ‘ call up this one ’ or ‘ take a look at that one ’ , said : ‘ why does no - one ever ask me about @entity8 the @entity10 goalkeeper ? ’ a slightly surprised silence among studio presenters gave way to a consensus that amounted to : good question , why does no one ever talk about @entity8 ? two months later and more people are talking about the @entity10 goalkeeper than ever before			1
@entity18 , not prone to agreeing with @entity2 , said after @entity8 ’s performance against his team on @entity21 : ‘ he was marvellous , just as he was marvellous last season ’			1
@entity10 goalkeeper @entity8 could be in for an unexpected call up to the @entity3 squad this year @entity26 's @entity25 ( right ) caught up with the goalkeeper at @entity10 's training ground @entity3 stays glued to the @entity29 during @entity31 ’s winter break and @entity8 ’s performances only enhanced his chances of becoming no 3 behind @entity34 and @entity35 when the next squad is announced in march			1
‘ i heard what @entity2 said and it ’s honour , ’ he says at @entity10 ’s training ground			1
‘ it ’s not just that he spoke about me but that he was the one who brought my name up			2
no - one asked him			2
’ another famous @entity3 no 3 , @entity43 , is one of the major reasons why a 28 - year - old from @entity47 is now plying his trade in east @entity49			2
‘ i know @entity43 very well and i spoke with him before i signed for @entity10 , ’ @entity8 says			1
‘ he told me : “ do it , do n’t hesitate			2
the @entity29 is a great opportunity and you ’ll enjoy it hugely just as i enjoyed those years at @entity53 ”			1
’ he does n’t regret taking the advice			2
‘ it wins you over more with every game			2
there is never a match when it seems one of the two teams believe they ca n’t win			2
there are times in @entity3 when you have a team playing one of the big sides and because they have so much respect for them the attitude is “ let ’s defend and not lose by too many ”			1
here everyone goes for it			2
’ @entity3 manager @entity2 has talked up @entity8 's chances of getting an international opportunity @entity8 admitted he was delighted to hear the encouraging words of the @entity3 boss earlier this season @entity77 's @entity35 's position as @entity3 no 1 looks solid for years to come not that switching from @entity3 to the @entity29 was easy			1
as with @entity80 , there were adjustments for @entity8 to make			1
‘ the play is a lot more physical here , there are a lot more high balls into the area and the refereeing is different , ’ he says			2
‘ in @entity3 the slightest push on the keeper , especially if he goes down , the referee will blow			0
you have to watch the flight of the ball and dodge the challenges			0
‘ that ’s the biggest difference but i have adapted well			0
i was good in the air in @entity3 and i ’m big enough to cope so that has helped			0
’ there were other adjustments to make			0
@entity103 goalkeepers are more prone to punch than catch and tend to be more comfortable using their feet			0
you ca n’t imagine @entity107 favours a punching playmaker between the posts			0
‘ it ’s true that here they do n’t like you to punch , ’ @entity8 says , ‘ but sometimes when the area is crowded and you try to catch you can get a nudge from someone , the ball gets away , and if they do n’t blow for a foul it ’s a goal			1
sometimes a good punch will clear the ball very effectively so you have to mix it up			0
with passing the ball out from the back you ca n’t be taking unnecessary risks , but if you are decisive then there should n’t be a problem			0
’ @entity8 was a late starter , not taking up the gloves until he was 11 and not breaking into the @entity130 first team until 25			1
‘ i was an outfield player before i was a goalkeeper , ’ he says			0
‘ i played up front until i was 10 and i loved to score goals but when my under 11 team @entity133 lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked : “ who wants to go in goal ? ” ‘ i said i did n’t mind while we looked for a new keeper — 18 years on i ’m still in goal ! ’ the former @entity130 man pulls off a remarkable save against @entity29 champions @entity141 since making his @entity29 debut , no goalkeeper has made more saves than @entity10 's @entity8 @entity8 was called ' marvellous ' by @entity18 after his recent performance at @entity146 he stayed at @entity130 for 16 years but had to wait for @entity148 ’s arrival to graduate to first choice in 2012			1
‘ an obstacle always seemed to crop up			0
three years ago i tore my cruciate and the following year i started as third keeper but the first keeper was n’t playing well and the second keeper had problems after saying something in an interview that the manager did n’t like so my chance came and i took it			0
’ he ’s bright too , picking up the language despite starting from zero			0
‘ you have to launch yourself into it without worrying about sounding like a fool			0
you need basic phrases immediately			0
you ca n’t be thinking how do i say ‘ away ’ or ‘ man - on ’ when you are in the middle of the game			1
‘ i have my own @entity170 teacher because my girlfriend speaks excellent @entity170			0
deciphering accents can be the biggest problem and there are plenty in the dressing room			0
’ there are also plenty of @entity103 speakers at the club , though @entity107 is not one of them			0
‘ i think he knows “ tapas ” and “ cerveza ” , ’ says @entity8			1
‘ but the coaching staff are taking @entity103 and @entity187 classes			0
’ @entity8 ’s family knew all about @entity10 from @entity189 , a former @entity130 youth player who played for the club			1
and @entity8 adds : ‘ they also signed @entity192			1
i was only a kid but when @entity103 players come abroad — especially a goalkeeper — you notice which club he has signed for			0
’ @entity8 was aware that former @entity197 goalkeeper @entity192 had played for the @entity10 before him the @entity10 ' goal , under @entity8 's stewardship , has seemed impenetrable at times this season his references also go back to the club ’s finest keeper			1
‘ do n’t worry , i also know who @entity203 is ! i know he is a legendary keeper for this club and everyone loves him			0
’ @entity203 was in goal the last time @entity10 won something , lifting the @entity210 in 1980			1
@entity8 believes the team is moving in the right direction after a good summer in the transfer market			1
‘ there is a change of style , ’ he says			0
‘ the signings have brought a lot more variety and more options , and now the manager can make decisions and think “ how do we approach this game ? ” we now we have plan a , b or @entity221 ‘ you can really build from midfield when you have a player like @entity232 who will always show for the ball and move it on			0
that helps the team to build from the back and not always play the long ball			1
’ the one thing @entity8 oozes is enthusiasm for the game			1
he does n’t overplay it , but having seen two young team - mates lose their lives — @entity246 and @entity245 both to cancer aged 23 and 20 — it can only have made him more aware of the speed at which not just a career but also life itself can pass a player by			1
@entity8 reacts quickly to make a save against @entity256 at the @entity257 @entity8 said the @entity29 has grown on him and he thoroughly enjoys life in the competition ‘ i had played with @entity246 from the youth team , ’ he says			1
‘ we were very close friends because we had come through the youth system together			0
you never imagine it can happen to a team - mate			2
everyone has to die some time , but not someone like @entity246 who was so young and in the best moment of his life			2
‘ we have to make the most of life and make the most of times when things are going well			2
when these tragic things happen you are reminded of what life is about — enjoying being alive			1
’ he does that mantra justice with his goal celebrations that have endeared him to @entity10 fans			1
‘ you can feel a bit isolated in goal so when the team scores i love to celebrate , ’ he says			2
‘ i ca n’t go running to the other end of the pitch so i celebrate with the supporters			0
’ a festive dip in results and the failure to win at @entity291 in midweek have pegged back expectations			0
but @entity8 still feels @entity10 are moving forward			1
‘ maybe last season we would always hit teams in the same area so in the end they put a wall there			0
now we can vary the approach to get around that			0
’ as long as @entity8 ’s wall holds firm at the other end , they will have a chance .			1

@entity8 has excelled since breaking into the @entity10 first team
his form led to *praise* from national team boss @entity2
the former @entity130 man said he is enjoying life in the @entity29
even @entity312 boss @entity18 has been impressed with him
