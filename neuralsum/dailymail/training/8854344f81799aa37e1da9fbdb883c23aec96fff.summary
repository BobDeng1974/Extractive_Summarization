by @entity0 president @entity1 is directing federal employees to rat out their co-workers in a program designed to spot former @entity5 and @entity6 , but experts doubt whether the program is wise or effective the familiar command ' if you see something , say something ' has been moved into the federal government 's workplaces , according to a new report			1
the government 's @entity16 , a comprehensive initiative that stretches across 5 million security - cleared employees of all federal agencies and their contractors , was brought to life following an executive order from president @entity1 in 2011			1
he issued the directive after @entity27 private @entity26 sent untold numbers of classified documents to the anti-secrecy @entity31 website			0
the initiative asks federal government employees to spy on their co-workers , reporting to program agents on their unusual behaviors , strange attitudes , financial troubles and unprecedented travel - all indicators that a ' high - risk ' person might be engaged in espionage or other leaking of secret materials in a way that might cause ' harm to the @entity46			1
' in particular , it seeks to identify threats from federal employees who might cause ' damage to the @entity46 through espionage , terrorism , unauthorized disclosure of national security information or through the loss or degradation of departmental resources or capabilities , ' according to a secret government document prepared by a task force headed by director of national intelligence @entity62 and attorney general @entity64			1
the program was highlighted in a lengthy report from the @entity67 , whose reporters explored how psychological profiling of former computer hackers and espionage offenders revealed patterns and traits that spy experts believed could be identified pre-emptively			2
naysayers point to the @entity78 's screening program as an indicator that federal government efforts to profile potential threats are far off the mark @entity84 press secretary @entity83 was caught flat - footed during his briefing with reporters wednesday , admitting that a question about the @entity16 ' stumped ' him			1
\ ' i confess that i did not go read the @entity91 story , ' he said			0
the government 's own experts are questioning whether the program has value , and if it could be sacrificing personal civil liberties on the altar of enhanced security			2
@entity99 , a former @entity100 inspector general who oversaw spy satellite programs , said the program could create ' a repressive kind of culture			2
' he told @entity105 that the answer to spotting potential leakers should n't be ' to have a @entity109 - like response , ' referringto the feared @entity112 communists ' secret police			2
a @entity113 released wednesday found that for the first time , a plurality of @entity46 believe government efforts to crack down on terrorism through surveillance of ordinary @entity46 has gone too far			1
a strong majority said they see @entity122 leaker @entity121 as a ' whistle - blower , ' rather than as a ' traitor			1
' fancy yourself a @entity127 wannabee ? your @entity129 co-workers could rat you out as a reckless future secret - leaker a task force headed by director of national intelligence @entity62 and attorney general @entity64 ( r ) set the standards for the @entity16 a 2008 @entity135 report on detecting terrorists concluded that ' [ t ] here is no consensus in the relevant scientific community ... regarding whether any behavioral surveillance or physiological monitoring techniques are ready for use at all			1
' and ' doing something similar about predicting future leakers seems even more speculative , ' @entity144 , a statistics and social science professor at @entity147 told @entity105			0
@entity150 , a @entity151 spokeswoman , said in a statement that the @entity16 includes provisions to protect ' civil rights , civil liberties and privacy , ' but @entity105 reported that she did n't identify any of them			0
the @entity158 oversees government programs that aim to detect secretive threats to national security			0
its spokesman @entity162 said that in the past , co-workers of eventual leakers saw patterns of behavior that they never reported to anyone			0
' the awareness effort of the program is to teach people not only what types of activity to report , ' @entity162 said , ' but how to report it and why it is so important to report it			2
' but he cautioned that the program ' does not mandate ' that employees report anything to their supervisors			1
“ it simply educates employees about basic activities or behavior that might suggest a person is up to improper activity , ” he said			0
the government has been stung by leaks from @entity121 , a fugutive former @entity122 contractor 's employee who absconded with state secrets and leaked them to @entity190 , a @entity191 newspaper ' if you see someone reading classified documents they should not be reading , especially if this happens multiple times and the person appears nervous that you saw him , that is activity that is suspicious and should be reported , @entity162 told @entity105			0
' the insider threat team then looks at the surrounding facts and draws the conclusions about the activity			0
' some agencies , however , have taken the program further than merely looking for deviations from normal work patterns			1
the @entity207 is asking private security personnel to be on the lookout for employees with ' a desire to help the " underdog " or a particular cause , ' those who are ' @entity214 [ s ] , and anyone with a ' divided loyalty : allegiance to another person or company or to a country besides the @entity46			1
' the @entity129 is reportedly implementing a system - wide training program whose goal is to set up @entity16 offices with access to every security official and contractor manager			1
' what we really point out is if you ’re in doubt , report , because that ’s what the investigative personnel are there to do , is to get the bottom of " is this just noise or is this something that is really going on ? " ' a senior @entity27 counterintelligence and security official named @entity243 told @entity105			0
@entity84 press secretary @entity83 admitted wednesday that a question about the @entity16 ' stumped ' him			1
' i confess that i did not go read the @entity91 story , ' he said the program has become the subject of ridicule among some experts who say noticing odd behaviors is n't an effective tool for identifying future espionage suspects			0
@entity254 , a former @entity255 intelligence chief who chaired the @entity256 , said that ' an amateur ' like a typical federal employee would have little success			0
he also said employees should be oriented toward helping their co-workers , not toward reporting them for internal discipline			2
but the @entity1 administration is poised to implement the program fully , following @entity121 's disclosures about @entity122 programs that scoop up communications data from ordinary @entity46 on the strength of directives from secretive courts			1
' leaks related to national security can put people at risk , ' the president said just weeks ago			0
' they can put men and women in uniform that i ’ve sent into the battlefield at risk			0
they can put some of our intelligence officers , who are in various , dangerous situations that are easily compromised , at risk			0
... so i make no apologies , and i do n’t think the @entity46 people would expect me as commander in chief not to be concerned about information that might compromise their missions or might get them killed			2

reporter 's question about the secret program has @entity1 press secretary @entity83 ' stumped ' during @entity84 briefing
