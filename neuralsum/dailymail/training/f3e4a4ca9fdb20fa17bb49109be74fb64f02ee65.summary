children in @entity1 are less likely to grow up living with both parents than in almost any other country in the western world			1
just two thirds are still living in the same household as their natural mother and father by the age of 14			1
only in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 are children more likely to grow up outside the traditional nuclear family , according to research by the @entity16			1
while 68.9 per cent of @entity1 children aged up to 14 live with both their parents , in the @entity21 the figure is 70.7 per cent and in @entity22 79.5 per cent			1
the stability league the @entity1 proportion is also much lower than @entity25 on 82 per cent			2
@entity27 children are most likely still to be living with both parents , at 95.2 per cent			2
critics say the figures demonstrate the declining importance of marriage in the @entity1 compared with our neighbours – and called on ministers to implement tax breaks for married couples			1
marriage rates have more than halved in the past 40 years , while the number of lone - parent households increased by an average of 26,000 a year from the early 1980s to 2010			2
family support : @entity43 , pictured with wife @entity44 , pointed to evidence that children tend to enjoy better life outcomes when the same two parents are able to give them support and protection throughout their childhood @entity43 , the @entity51 , pointed to evidence that children tend to enjoy better life outcomes when the same two parents are able to give them support and protection throughout their childhood			1
figures show that 28 per cent of children in lone - parent families live in relative poverty , compared with 17 per cent for couple families			1
mr @entity43 said : ‘ when families are strong and stable , so are children – showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes			1
but when things go wrong – either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship – the impact on a child ’s later life can be devastating			0
‘ we have already invested £ 30million in relationship support , to prevent family breakdown rather than waiting to pick up the pieces			0
‘ across government we ’re working to improve the support available for families who experience abuse at home by more effectively punishing the perpetrator and doing more to educate young people about domestic violence			0
’ @entity85 , from the pressure group @entity83 , said : ‘ children born to cohabiting parents are much more likely to see their parents separate than those born to married parents , and with almost half of births now taking place outside marriage rates of family breakdown look set to remain high			2
‘ with family breakdown costing the taxpayer an estimated £ 44billion per year , the government should be unashamedly promoting the benefits of marriage and creating a climate which encourages couples to get married and stay married			0
‘ most other @entity102 countries recognise marriage in the tax system , but in the @entity1 the government has been dragging its feet over fulfilling its coalition agreement pledge to introduce transferable tax allowances for married couples			1
‘ the government should put that right without further delay and , at the same time , needs to start overhauling a benefits system that incentivises lone parenthood			0
for too long , government policy has pretended that all types of family structure are of equal value to society			0
’ the figures are contained in a ‘ family database ’ published by the @entity16 , which represents the world ’s industrialised countries			0
they refer to 2007 – the latest year in which a comparison is possible			0
across the organisation , which is mainly comprised of countries in @entity102 , @entity127 and @entity128 , an average of 84.1 per cent of children are still living with both parents at the age of 14			1
stability : mr @entity43 said : ' when families are strong and stable , so are children ' the only countries below the @entity1 on the league table are @entity10 on 64.9 per cent ; @entity11 on 66.8 per cent ; and @entity12 on 65.0 per cent			1
however , the proportion is far higher in countries such as @entity140 ( 92.1 per cent ) , @entity141 ( 91.5 per cent ) and @entity142 ( 91.5 per cent )			0
the family database confirmed that the @entity1 has the highest proportion of children living in a single - parent household in western @entity102 – and is behind only the @entity21 and @entity11 in the @entity16			1
some 22.9 per cent of @entity1 children aged up to 14 are living with a lone parent , compared with only 9.2 per cent in @entity140			1
in @entity25 the proportion is 13.4 per cent , and in @entity22 13.3 per cent			0
across the @entity16 the average is 15.9 per cent			0
@entity1 is beaten only by @entity11 ( 24 per cent ) and the @entity21 ( 25.8 per cent )			1
@entity151 , managing director of the @entity152 , said the league table proved that ministers needed to recognise marriage in the tax system			0
‘ timid politicians are becoming numb to @entity1 ’s sky - high family breakdown rates , ’ he said			2
‘ behind too many front doors family instability damages adults and children			0
yet , as these @entity16 figures show , broken families are not some inevitable feature of modern society or “ social progress ”			2
‘ all kinds of transformational help can be offered to parents and couples when they come under life ’s pressures			0
‘ it is time for people who oppose things that would stem the tide of breakdown , such as backing marriage as the most stable path for children , to stop playing politics			2
our forgotten families need all the help we can offer			0

just two thirds of children still live with mother or father at the age of 14
only in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 are children are statistics worse
critics say figures demonstrate declining importance of marriage in @entity1
