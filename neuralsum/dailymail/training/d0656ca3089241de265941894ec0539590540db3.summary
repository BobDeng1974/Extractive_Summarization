life - long battle : @entity2 's hair started falling out after her father died when she was 19 she is known to millions of @entity4 and @entity5 viewers for having a @entity7 - worthy bouffant			1
but today @entity2 reveals the truth : she has waged a life - long battle with thinning hair			1
although afflicted since her teens , her most severe bout began two years ago when she noticed visible patches of scalp and found clumps of hair on brushes and her pillow , and clogging up the shower plughole			1
@entity2 , 47 , says : ‘ an inch fell out from all around my hairline , and i had bald patches in my parting all over the top of my head that were up to a centimetre wide			1
‘ i felt dreadful and unattractive , and panicked that it was all going to come out			0
' i ’d leave my hair down to try to disguise it or use brown eye shadow to cover up the bald patches			2
' i was miserable and hated looking at pictures of myself			0
’ about 40 per cent of women will experience some degree of hair loss by the age of 50 due to hormonal changes			1
but female pattern baldness remains a taboo subject , and @entity2 hopes that by speaking out she will reassure others			1
she also wants to offer hope as , using supplements made from sea algae , she is regaining her locks			2
@entity2 first discovered her hair was thinning after her father died and she moved out of her family home in @entity47 , @entity48 , aged 19			1
‘ both the trauma of my father dying and the change of diet had an impact on my hair , ’ she recalls			1
‘ i skipped meals and did n’t eat as well as i could have done			0
’ temporary hair loss can be accelerated by stress , poor diet and weight loss			1
while it generally lasts only six months , @entity2 ’s continued until , at 27 , pregnancy caused a rise in oestrogen			1
it stopped her hair falling out and it looked fuller again			2
but three months after the birth of son @entity66 , her hair started falling out again and @entity2 – who split up with her baby ’s father while she was pregnant – struggled to cope			1
‘ it was something else to deal with in addition to the upheaval of single motherhood , ’ she says			0
‘ it was a mess			0
’ when @entity2 found fame in 1998 playing @entity78 in sitcom @entity79 , her thinning hair was n’t initially a concern – it was neatly tucked away under a hat			1
but things changed when she joined @entity4 in 2001			0
receding : actress and loose women host @entity2 found that she had bald patches as her hair loss got worse two years ago ‘ on screen , with it all blow - dried , it looked fine , ’ she says			1
‘ but i secretly hated what i looked like			0
as a shop girl i ’d be asked to wear my hair up			2
as i got more comfortable with the make - up girls , i ’d ask them to leave some curly bits at the front to make it look fuller			0
’ being subjected to the paparazzi forced @entity2 to fake a full head of hair			1
‘ clip - in extensions became my favourite accessory , ’ she says			0
in 2006 , on a three - year break from the soap , she cut her hair short and bleached it			2
but it ended up even more brittle			0
‘ the peroxide killed it			0
as my hair grew i had weaves put in [ in which hair extensions are sewn on to the hair ] , but my hair was so weak it broke			2
’ she returned to the cobbles and the role of @entity115 in 2009 , dyeing her hair brown to make it look fuller			2
the hair loss @entity2 suffers is a surprisingly common problem and very distressing			1
nutritional deficiency can be the cause , particularly with iron store levels , which need to be at a certain level for good hair growth			2
if a diet is lacking in nutrients , supplements can help			2
commonly hair loss will be caused by thyroid problems or fungal scalp infections or will start post-pregnancy , and in these situations supplements would be unlikely to help			1
in many patients with female alopecia , there seems to be no obvious underlying cause , but often the hair loss spontaneously improves whether or not a supplement is taken , usually after six months			1
these pills are unlikely to completely reverse hair loss in most women , but for the chance of some improvement they are worth a try			1
‘ @entity146 was popular and everyone wanted big hair , ’ she says			0
‘ i bought into the trend with clip - in extensions – i looked like a @entity153 doll			0
’ by 2012 , as she left the @entity4 , her hair had really started to fall out			1
‘ during my last year i was under a lot of stress over the change in my career and my relationship , ’ says @entity2 , who split with boyfriend @entity155 , 31 , last july			2
adrenal ‘ stress ’ glands secrete male hormones into the body , causing hair loss			1
she was also approaching the menopause , which affects levels of oestrogen too			0
low iron levels and thyroid disorders can also contribute , but the most common form of female hair loss – a condition called androgenetic alopecia – happens when the follicles become sensitive to normal levels of male hormones in the body			1
the main treatment is minoxidil , which is applied to the scalp and stimulates blood supply to encourage regrowth			0
steroid injections can also help by suppressing the immune system , which is thought to damage follicles			0
but @entity2 says : ‘ i did n’t feel ill and did n’t want to waste my doctor ’s time			2
i did n’t see my hair loss as an illness			1
i was embarrassed and would have found it too difficult to talk about			0
it was like saying the word “ balding ” would make it worse			0
’ after finishing filming last march , @entity2 had extensions to boost her self - esteem			2
‘ they were marvellous but they were n’t good for my hair , she says			0
‘ it grew dry and horrible , and every time the extensions came out i felt worse			0
’ in january she turned to supplements – those on the market include @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 – containing vitamins , minerals and marine extracts that can make hair grow stronger			1
‘ i was sceptical , ’ admits @entity2			2
‘ i worried it would be a waste of money			0
’ but , in conjunction with a healthy diet , she believes they have made a difference , and two months ago she took out her extensions			0
‘ i ’m not saying this is the solution for everyone but it feels as if i have more hair , ’ she says			0
‘ it feels healthier and more invigorated			0
i feel like i have taken action and not let the beginnings of the menopause take control of who i am			0
’ @entity2 uses @entity232 supplements to promote healthy hair growth , £ 49.95 ( a month 's supply ) available from boots and @entity236			1

actress @entity2 , 47 , has been battling hair loss since her teens
problem started when her father died and she moved out of family home
now she takes supplements containing minerals and marine extracts
