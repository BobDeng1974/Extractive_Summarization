@entity0 has signalled his readiness to step into the depths of a crisis which is threatening to end @entity5 's season with a whimper			1
the 31 - year - old @entity7 has been used as a substitute in the @entity10 ' last two games after his return to the squad following a successful battle against testicular cancer			1
however , as head coach @entity15 prepares for saturday 's @entity17 fixture against @entity18 at @entity19 with suspension and injury severely limiting his options , @entity0 is offering his services in whatever role he is needed			1
@entity0 posted this picture to his official @entity27 account on wednesday morning the @entity5 midfielder made his second substitute appearance in the defeat by @entity31 on sunday he told the journal : ' three years ago when we finished fifth , i played in many positions			1
i was playing in different positions because we had problems with injuries			2
' i 'm here to help			2
i work hard and i want to enjoy			2
always , i have to do the best for the team			0
' we have to finish in the top 10			0
we do n't have any excuses			0
we have hard games up to the finish of the season , but we have to take points and finish in the top 10			0
' a winger by trade , @entity0 played as a full - back for his country at the 2010 @entity53 finals , and that ability could come in useful during the remaining weeks of the season			1
skipper and close friend @entity56 will miss the next three games after failing in a bid to have the red card he received at @entity31 on sunday overturned on appeal , and with @entity63 and @entity64 out for the rest of the season through injury , @entity55 is the club 's only recognised senior central defender			1
@entity0 , who recently returned to first team after beating testicular cancer , is ready to step in where needed @entity0 and his @entity5 team - mates applaud the travelling fans after the 3 - 0 defeat by the @entity31 @entity74 on was n't sentimental - @entity15 that could mean a move inside for right - back @entity77 against the @entity79 , and with the @entity80 currently the club 's only fit specialist full - back , @entity0 could be required to slot into a re-shaped back four , as @entity84 has done in recent weeks , although @entity15 will hope to have @entity85 ready for the weekend			1
@entity5 have won only one of their last six games and scored just three goals in the process , and with leading marksman @entity94 just one match into his seven - game ban , their hopes of a top - 10 finish appear to be receding			1
@entity0 said : ' we do n't have enough players at the moment			2
@entity99 is banned for three games			0
but we have to keep together and work hard for the manager			0
' the manager will tell us what we have to do			0
we have to do it right on the pitch			0
no excuses , we have to do it better			0

@entity5 play @entity18 at @entity19 in @entity17 on saturday
@entity55 is the club 's only recognised centre back for the game
@entity0 is ready to fill the void and play wherever necessary
@entity7 has made two substitute appearances since returning to side
