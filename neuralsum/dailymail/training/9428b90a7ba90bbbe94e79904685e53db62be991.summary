by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 10:09 est , 18 may 2013 boisterous , mischievous and reluctant to heed their commanders , these young cadets hardly resemble a crack military unit			1
another plays tug - of - war with old rope			1
but next year they will be among an elite @entity11 team sniffing out roadside bombs in @entity13			1
they are the latest eight recruits on the @entity16 's new @entity15 ( @entity15 ) scheme - dubbed the ' @entity17 '			1
the finest four - legged recruits join the @entity53 at @entity54 troops on patrol carry state - of - the - art electronic detection equipment			1
but old - fashioned sniffer dogs , each trained at a cost of £ 20,000 , remain invaluable , saving the lives of countless servicemen			1
major @entity63 , officer commanding the @entity11 's @entity65 , said : ' dogs have a proven track record			1
they can be quicker than technical solutions and do n't go wrong			1
give them food and sleep and you have a top - quality bomb disposal unit			1
' @entity75 : private @entity28 plays with 13 week old puppy @entity27			1
play and retrieve is one of the first lessons the dogs learn , so fetching a ball training : lance corporal @entity20 takes @entity21 through an agility exercise proud : private @entity28 with @entity27 , a @entity36 malinois who is on the puppy programme but before deploying to war , the dogs must prove they can perform the vital task			1
the ' @entity17 ' is run at the 110 - year - old @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , a 360acre facility surrounded by green fields in @entity89 , @entity90			1
the @entity91 is the first newspaper to see the programme , started two years ago by the @entity93			1
in the past , the @entity16 purchased older dogs - usually aged 15months			1
but military chiefs now believe it is more advantageous to buy pups at eight weeks ' old			1
@entity29 runs forward during training at @entity100 in @entity89 duty : sgt @entity26 with @entity102 , play during training learning the ropes : lance corporal @entity20 takes @entity21 , a 13 - week - old @entity35 puppy , through an agility exercise ' they are blank canvasses , ' said maj leavis			2
' it 's like building a high - performance racing car from scratch			1
' we want dogs to jump on chairs , clamber on settees , climb over obstacles			2
that will be their job , to find what they are looking for			2
' if they come to use having been told it is wrong , naughty or " get off " , we have to put in extra time and effort re-training them			2
' the latest litter - sized intake are @entity129 , @entity22 , @entity30 and @entity21 - all @entity35			1
the other two , @entity130 and @entity24 , are @entity132 shepherds			2
detection dogs are bought after stringent assessments			2
as well as medical checks , they take tough aptitude tests , including being startled by loud noises and ' find and fetch ' games			2
trainers look for boldness , character , agility , a desire to play and interact			2
maj @entity63 compares this to ' a school 's 11 - plus exam '			1
' we look for robustness of body and mind , ' he said			2
' are they investigative and curious ? ' throw a ball , and will the dog have the drive to fetch it ? or will it sit watching birds fly past ? ' we want dogs for our most difficult task : detecting bombs			1
if they do n't have the aptitude and concentration , they do n't posses the right qualities			2
' to the dogs , the training programme , which lasts six months , is simply playing			2
puppies : @entity22 and @entity21 take a break from training from the @entity15 ( @entity171 ) scheme old - fashioned sniffer dogs , each trained at a cost of £ 20,000 , remain invaluable , saving the lives of countless servicemen one game is hide - and - seek			1
a favourite toy is concealed and the dog must retrieve it			2
at first the object is stashed within a few feet			2
then it will be several hundred yards away			2
maj @entity63 said : ' the puppy who searches for his toy shows an important trait of a bomb - sniffing dog			1
if he ca n't find his way out of a wet paper bag , no chance			2
' later , pups learn to indicate or respond to odours			2
once a dog sits by an object with a scent he has been taught , he has detected the ' bomb ' and will be rewarded with a snack , toy or cuddle			0
@entity202 said : ' we are trying to build - up their drive , their will to win			0
finding the scent is winning the game			0
' eventually , the ' win ' will be finding an @entity210 and that will earn their reward			0
to the dogs it is playing			0
' pups are encouraged to improve their dexterity by climbing over mini-obstacles , scampering through pipes , running up steps and delving nosily into dark corners			0
' it 's like having soft play areas for pre-school children , ' said maj leavis			1
' when they become soldiers , they will progress to assault courses			0
' handlers also build up dogs ' confidence so they are not spooked in unfamiliar surroundings			0
walks among crowds of people on busy @entity89 market days , rides along bumpy tracks in noisy vehicles or strolls near herds of cows help reinforce robustness			0
later , they will be exposed to simulated explosions , gunshots and helicopters - the sounds heard regularly in @entity13			1

learning : private @entity28 with @entity27			0
@entity27 is at the start of his training , so his skills are limited maj @entity63 said : ' they might have good noses for smelling explosives but can they continue to find them when scary things happen ? ' we have to replicate as far as we can everything a dog will see and hear on operations			0
' the last thing you want is for a dog to feel threatened on day one of a mission , to go to @entity13 and suddenly discover it did n't like sand or someone shooting a gun			1
' training is done by positive reinforcement			0
find the hidden toy ? the pooch gets rewarded			0
undesirable behaviour is ignored and leads to a short period of ' time out '			0
at six months ' old , the dogs are streamed into disciplines that suit their qualities - like school pupils choosing between maths , geography chemistry and @entity348 for their a-level			0
some will specialise in protection - guarding defence facilities such as nuclear installations and @entity11 garrisons			1
sniffer dogs hunt drugs , smuggled currency , weapons and even poachers ' trophies such as rhino horns and elephant tusks			0
but the ones who come top of the class get the priority task of hunting hidden explosives including roadside bombs			1
maj @entity63 said : ' as with soldiers , they wo n't all end up in the @entity371			0
some will be drivers , some will be engineers , but they 're all important cogs in the machine			0
' at 15 months old , the dogs are ready to deploy			0
currently , about a dozen ' puppy programme ' graduates are in @entity13			1
maj @entity63 said : ' it 's fantastic to know that what you are doing in your daily work is down the line helping to save the lives of soldiers on the ground			1

eight puppies have become the latest recruits on the @entity16 's new ' @entity17 '
next year they will be among an elite @entity11 team sniffing out roadside bombs in @entity13
