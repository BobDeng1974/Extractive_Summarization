the @entity0 , who recently said that @entity2 is going to use @entity3 to punish the @entity4 for being tolerant of @entity6 people , have created a ' hate list ' of groups they say defy their own beliefs , including atheists , humanists and pro-gay rights groups			1
the fundamentalist organization - notorious for its opposition to homosexuality and same - sex marriage , abortion and pornography - has formatted the list on their website , calling it the ' anti-christian bigotry map ' , saying those listed are ' deeply intolerant ' to their faith and want ' to silence @entity27 and to remove all public displays of @entity30 heritage and faith in @entity4 '			1
the non-profit - based in @entity33 , @entity34 - has even targeted leading social justice organizations , such as the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) and the @entity38 and @entity39 , for the map			1
evangelical churches were not featured on the list just because they are in agreement that homosexuality is a sin , religious website @entity46 noted			2
' hate list ' : the @entity0 , a fundamentalist @entity30 non-profit , has released this interactive map on their website , allowing followers to identify what the @entity0 says are groups that are ' deeply intolerant towards the @entity30 religion ' and some who have ' committed violent crimes against @entity27 and faith - based groups ' key : the website allows users to navigate the map according to which ' hate group ' they want to find the map appears to be a reaction to a list of ' hate groups ' released by the @entity38			1
the @entity0 has been on that list , something they have called ' slanderous '			1
the @entity38 says those identified ' have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people , typically for their immutable characteristics '			0
however the groups that feature on the @entity0 map do n't seem too bothered			2
on their website , the @entity36 wrote in response : ' we , as well as the rest of the @entity6 community , will be able to find each other and unite as ' advocates for the legalization and promotion of same - sex marriage '			2
hurrah ! ' the organization also pointed out some apparent inaccuracies in the map			0
' unfortunately , however , we will be not be able to meet at @entity36 ’s offices in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 that are included on the @entity0 ’s map , because they do n’t exist			1
' fundamentalists : the @entity0 is headquartered in @entity33 , @entity34 ( left ) and presided over by @entity0 , son of @entity0 founder , reverend @entity98 however the @entity0 remained defiant in standing up for their cause			0
' some members or supporters of these groups ( on the map ) have committed violent crimes against @entity27 and faith - based groups , ' the organization said			0
' physical and profane verbal assaults against @entity27 are methods frequently exercised in their angry methods of intimidation			0
' @entity0 , the son of the @entity0 's founder , reverend @entity98 , is the current president			0
the @entity0 promotes itself as ' one of the largest and most effective pro-family organizations in the country '			2
the organization recently spoke out in support of @entity119 ’s passing an anti-gay law that calls for @entity121 or anyone ' promoting ' homosexuality to be jailed , potentially for life .			0
