he scored the two goals at the @entity2 that saw off @entity3 in the last 16 , he scored in the @entity4 to leave the league title in @entity7 's hands , and with two more goals on wednesday in the @entity10 , @entity8 put his team practically in the @entity13 semi-finals			1
he is starting to look like £ 75million very well spent – especially in view of the fact that @entity16 , the man he nutmegged twice en route to both goals on wednesday , cost £ 50m			0
the @entity20 call the nutmeg a ' tunnel ' and in @entity23 they are hailing the ' @entity24 ' that have led @entity7 to within two games of the @entity27 final on june 6			1
@entity8 curls the ball home for his second and @entity7 's third against @entity30 @entity8 celebrates with @entity31 as @entity7 took a giant step towards the @entity13 semi-finals @entity8 started the season late because of his @entity36 ban and , on his own admission , was anxious in front of goal when he first joined @entity31 and @entity40 – too conscious of the need not to appear greedy in the company of two world - class finishers			1
but now the numbers speak for themselves			0
he has scored 13 goals in his last 14 games – six from six in the @entity13			1
his overall tally is 18 and @entity7 's front three are on 91 for the season			2
they look set to eclipse arguably the club 's greatest front three of @entity40 , @entity52 and @entity53 who scored 100 goals in the 2008 - 09 campaign			1
they also look to have even more about them than the @entity59 trio of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 who won the @entity13 last season			0
the ease with with which @entity8 has fitted into @entity7 's front three should not be underestimated			1
@entity67 tweeted : ' @entity8 does the dirty work for @entity40 & @entity31 without losing any quality '			1
@entity8 's relationship with @entity40 both on and off the field has blossomed in recent months @entity8 , @entity31 and @entity40 have established themselves as the most feared front three in the world and it 's true that he batters defenders and tirelessly runs the channels , freeing up space for his @entity80 and @entity81 team - mates			1
but it 's no longer about @entity8 applying the body shots and @entity31 and @entity40 landing the knockout punch – he is now getting the winning goals himself			1
' we have seen him do it before for @entity88 and @entity89 , ' said @entity90 after wednesday 's game			0
@entity8 now has 15 goals in 2015 – almost twice as many as the eight managed by @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 between them			1
he has also stayed clear of controversy			0
last week he gave an in - depth radio interview with @entity100 and even made a light - hearted reference to the nonsensical action at the @entity103 that cost him his place in the tournament and in this summer 's @entity106			0
' i was going to say we have a very special hunger but i had better use another word , ' he said when asked about what sets @entity113 players apart			2
he hates the biting pun headlines but after such a wonderful night in @entity115 he might let references in @entity117 as to @entity118 in @entity115 pass , especially the line that read , ' seeing @entity16 come on to the pitch must have been like a full moon to a werewolf '			0
@entity8 enjoyed great success against @entity16 , twice nutmegging the former @entity126 player @entity16 was made to look rather ordinary by the @entity7 forward as he struggled on his return from injury it 's true he devoured @entity16 , as he scored goal numbers 1,000 and 1,001 in @entity7 's history in @entity133 competition			1
there was a touch of the @entity52 about the goal too			0
it revived memories of @entity52 's strike in @entity140 2009 against @entity141			0
after nutmegging @entity16 , the way @entity8 combined that light touch with the use of his upper - body strength to repel @entity146 and @entity147 was the perfect illustration of how he pairs the physical attributes of a centre forward , with the quick feet of a winger			2
it was another goal scored cutting in from the right much like the second he scored against @entity155 in @entity80 at the @entity103			0
he began his @entity7 career on the right with @entity40 playing through the middle but admitted last week that in one game @entity40 switched places with him and told him to stay through the middle			1
part of his remit is to dovetail with the four - times @entity164 winner			0
if @entity40 plays centrally then he runs the right - hand channel			2
if @entity40 wants to hug the right touchline , then he plays through the middle			2
he was often as accommodating at @entity89 with @entity93 so he was never going to say no to @entity40			2
@entity8 was accommodating when he played with @entity93 at @entity89 last season the degree to which those two , and the younger more frivolous @entity31 have got along together off the pitch has helped them gel so quickly on it			1
did you hear the one about the @entity113 , the @entity80 and the @entity81 sounds like the start of a joke - on wednesday the defenders trying to cope with them will not have seen the funny side			1
' it 's not over , ' he said after the game when asked about next week 's second leg			0
and he also said he nutmegged @entity16 because ' it was the only way to get past him '			0
he knows there are 90 minutes more to negotiate before @entity7 can celebrate reaching the final four			2
it would n't do to linger too long on how he had destroyed the world 's most expensive defender – the replays of those two goals will do that on their own .			0

@entity8 scored twice as @entity7 beat @entity30 3 - 1
the @entity113 had a slow start at the club but is now in *impressive* form
he has scored 13 goals in his last 14 games and six from six in @entity133
his relationship with @entity40 and @entity31 has reaped *rewards*
