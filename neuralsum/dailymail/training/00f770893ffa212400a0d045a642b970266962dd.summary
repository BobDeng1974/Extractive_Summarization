@entity1 promises to bring virtual reality experiences to everyone but , with the general release not expected till next year , it 's not yet widely available			1
but if you do n't want to wait , or do n't have the money to shell out for a developer kit , one company has an alternative solution			0
their bizarre headset lets you strap an @entity11 , or an upcoming @entity12 , to your face and apparently gives wearers the same virtual reality experience as those enjoyed on @entity1			1
the £ 30 ( $ 49 ) virtual reality headset works by strapping an @entity11 to your face ( shown ) @entity22 , which will retail for £ 30 ( $ 49 ) , is a project from company @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity26			1
they are currently seeking $ 20,000 in funding on @entity29 to bring the product to market			0
if funding is achieved they hope to begin rolling out the device later this year			0
@entity35 was founded by 21 - year - old college dropout @entity1			2
it is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games , but for other activities as well			2
@entity41 purchased the company earlier this year when their $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) deal to buy @entity35 headset firm @entity45 was approved			1
it will first be used for immersive games , but @entity41 ceo @entity48 promised the headset will ' change the way we work , play and communicate ' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted @entity48			0
a commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015			0
the purchase of @entity45 put @entity41 in a battle with @entity57 , who has already unveiled its own version of a @entity35 headset , destined for the @entity61 next year			2
to use the headset an @entity11 is slotted into the holder at the front , with its display then split into two identical screens just like on an @entity1 , providing a @entity68 virtual reality experience			1
the user then straps the entire device to their head with straps , while foam pads ensure a comfortable fit			0
inside there are two lenses inside the headset which provide stereoscopic vision while looking at the @entity11			2
attaching headphones through the @entity11 ’s standard headphone port will also allow for sound to be played to the user			0
while wearing the headset the user still has access to the buttons on the @entity11			0
and the device also works with compatible gamepads so the user can enjoy gaming through the headset			0
there is also a ‘ touchstrip ’ of buttons on the headset to control @entity22 in and out of the virtual reality experience			1
in addition , unlike other @entity35 systems like the @entity1 this device does not require a power source in the headset ; instead , it relies solely on the built - in battery of the @entity11			1
for true @entity68 experiences apps and movies need to be developed specifically for such a virtual reality device			2
to show off the technology @entity18 has developed photo , movie and panorama apps for use with their headset			0
by splitting the screen and providing two lenses the viewer then can be given a @entity35 experience like @entity1			1
the device will retail for about $ 49 and should be on sale later this year the company is also developing a version for @entity12 called @entity22 + ( pictured )			1
previously they had tried to use the @entity35 technology with the @entity124 but found the screen to be too small ‘ the advanced 64 - bit processors and graphics systems allow @entity22 to immerse users in vivid 3d worlds and experiences without the need for an external computer , ’ the company explains on their @entity29 page			2
the company are also planning to bring the device to @entity135 's @entity12 when it is released soon with @entity22 +			1
previously they had tried to use the @entity35 technology with the @entity124 but found the screen to be too small			0
the larger screen size of the @entity12 will allow them to replicate a similar virtual reality experience to that on the @entity11			1
