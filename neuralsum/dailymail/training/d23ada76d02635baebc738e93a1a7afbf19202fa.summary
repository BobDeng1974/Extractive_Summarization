the team from @entity9 believes that basalt , already detected on the red planet by rovers , could be used as a building material to create large underground caves and create a ‘ martian cement ’			1
‘ the surface of @entity17 is primarily composed of basalt , and the @entity20 lander directly sampled water ice in @entity17 soil , ’ the team say			2
martian bases could be built on the red planet by robots excavating underground caves , a group of @entity3 architects has claimed ‘ @entity27 is good material to make a protectional cave on , to produce insulation , and basalt roving , which is stronger than steel			1
’ the rovers would excavate large caves underground , leaving pillars of basalt to support the roof			1
when human explorers arrive , they would simply need to install windows , doors and life support systems			1

robots analyse basalt columns for strength			0
they then drill basalt , moving down and leaving pillars of the material as large columns to support the cave ’s roof			1
astronauts finish the construction and arrange technical facilities as water , oxygen , windows and doors using basalt material spun as a glass - fibre like cement			2
‘ curiosity sooner or later will bring human to @entity17 and would n't it be nice to have permanent station to explore it ? ’ @entity81 of @entity9 told @entity82			1
‘ it seems pretty logical to use caves as the main protective structure of the colony			0
' the team even believe basalt could be used to create a ‘ spider ’s silk ’ material similar to glass fibre that could be used as a building material			2
‘ we can weave minimal surfaces that will be used as floors on different levels in the cave , ’ she told @entity82			0
the architects propose that roving robots will weave spatial spider - like web that will be used as spaces and construction to hold domestic and technical facilities ‘ this material is already in use in the aerospace and automotive industries			0
it is stronger and lighter than steel , easier to operate , fireproof and it does not corrode , ’ she added			0
they also believe the bases could include farming areas , saying ‘ some martian soil is appropriate for growing certain agricultures , such as asparagus			0
‘ possibility of food production will make @entity17 settlements independent of expensive deliveries from the @entity122			0

@entity9 believes that basalt on @entity17 could be used as building material
rovers would excavate large caves underground , leaving pillars of basalt
when human explorers arrive , they would simply need to install windows , doors and life support systems to make they area *habitable*
