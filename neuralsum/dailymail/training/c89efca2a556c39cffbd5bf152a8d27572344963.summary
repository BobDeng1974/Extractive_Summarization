@entity0 and @entity1 have been two of the stand - out performers so far this season			1
@entity4 is like a modern - day @entity5 , changing defence to attack in an instant			1
he makes lots of high - intensity runs but dribbles from central areas and from deep			2
that makes him a threat because central midfielders often lack the pace and defensive mindset to cope , whereas full backs are more used to duels with quick wingers			2
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) both sealed moves from @entity22 to @entity23 in the summer @entity0 , pictured with @entity24 , scored on his his home debut against @entity26 at the weekend @entity27 congratulated @entity0 after his man of the match performance at @entity29 @entity30 forward @entity1 scored against @entity32 champions @entity31 on saturday @entity1 was mobbed by his @entity30 team - mates after scoring against @entity31 @entity0 and @entity1 played against each other during their time in @entity35 in the past , wide men were your best players but now they are coming inside - @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity4 — to wreak havoc in the middle			1
@entity1 has the rest of @entity30 dancing to his tune			1
his work rate is infectious and he battled with @entity45 all game on saturday			0
he plays higher up than @entity4 but gives @entity47 new options			0
the only way to stop them is to cut the supply line and try and get tight early to deny them space			0
otherwise you ’ll be left eating their dust .			0
