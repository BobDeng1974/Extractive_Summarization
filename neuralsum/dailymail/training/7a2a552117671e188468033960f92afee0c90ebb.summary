speaking with @entity8 today , @entity7 said : ‘ i ’m angry			2
we ’ve been stonewalled , to some extent , by the last people to see @entity11			2
’ @entity2 mysteriously vanished on june 3 , 2011 after a night out with friends			1
she was a student at @entity14			2
they hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence			1
‘ despite their claims of doing whatever they could do , the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us … they refuse to take a police polygraph , which we feel is important for a number of reasons , ’ mr @entity7 said			1
the television host also asked @entity11 ’s still - devastated mother if , more than a year after her daughter ’s disappearance , she had any theories as to who might have taken her			1
‘ our biggest dilemma is not knowing if it was a random abduction or if it was someone that @entity11 knew , ’ @entity18 told @entity8			1
she added that she now believes it to be someone who knew her daughter , based in part because of the lack of cooperation she and her husband have received from @entity11 ’s university friends			1
mr @entity7 added that while he and his wife now think their daughter is dead , they still cling to hope			2
‘ i understand that @entity11 may no longer be with us , ’ he said			2
‘ we ache for her			2
we want to bring her home			2
’ in august , mrs @entity18 posted a heartbreaking open letter to her daughter 's killer describing the intense agony of not knowing what happened to the missing @entity14 student			1
' i hope you have as many sleepless nights as i have , ' @entity18 wrote on a family blog			1
missing : @entity14 student @entity2 , 19 , disappeared from @entity81 , @entity82 , in june 2011			1
police have few clues about her whereabouts missing : @entity18 posted an open letter to her daughter 's killer an in effort to prod him or anyone who knows about her disappearance to come forward ' i hope that some day , your parents , your siblings , your friends will all be in a courtroom when your true self is revealed , the self which was born on june 3 , 2011 when you took @entity11 from us			1
' the search for @entity11 has taken one frustrating turn after another			2
when the investigation kicked off , five of her male friends , who police believed could have offered insight into the final moments before her disappearance , have hired criminal defense lawyers and quickly stopped fully cooperating with police			1
' we were shocked when several people hired attorneys within days of @entity11 ’s disappearance			2
five young men , five attorneys			0
i ’m still not sure why they felt it was necessary , ' she wrote			0
then , there have been multiple false leads -- possible suspects who were n't involved , remains found that did n't belong to @entity11			0
the most recent lead -- the skull discovered by a fisherman in mid july in the @entity129 -- 50 miles from where she disappeared -- could take up to eight weeks for the lab to process			1
waiting : the @entity133 are still awaiting the results of dna tests on a skill that was found 50 miles from @entity81 in the @entity129 in @entity137 ' that ’s 80,640 minutes of agony			1
we are waiting to find out if a skull found in the @entity129 might be @entity11 ’s			0
it ’s chilling to say the words			0
i find it incomprehensible that if by chance you are reading this , you know the answer already , ' mrs @entity18 wrote to her daughter 's as - yet - unidentified killer			1
she also described the intense pain of knowing her daughter was dead , but having no idea what happened to her			0
' for me , living without @entity11 , it ’s the little things in my day - to - day life which are the most difficult			1
the things that are n’t mentioned			0
getting mail addressed to @entity11 , walking past her room just as she left it the last time she was home , still waiting for her return			0
' the unpacked boxes i can not bear to move			0
the notice @entity167 ( @entity11 's father ) has hidden away among so many other pieces of mail , from the @entity170			0
' it ’s @entity11 ’s			0
it arrived shortly before her 21st birthday			0
we try to shield each other from more pain			0
it is impossible to do , ' she said			0
@entity179 answers : this surveillance photo is the last known image of @entity11			0
several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating in @entity81 , a quiet college town that is known as one of the safest cities in @entity188 , the scars of @entity11 's disappearance are visible even a year and a half later			0
her smiling face is visible on posters plastered on street corners , hung around the campus and posted in nearly every bar , restaurant and shop downtown			1
mrs @entity18 says she is writing so that her daughter 's killer , and presumably the other people who might know what happened to her , do n't forget about @entity11			1
