the goal , defense officials say , is to understand how head trauma leads to @entity15 , a neurodegenerative disorder that causes the progressive accumulation of a protein in nerve cells within certain regions of the brain			2
collecting brains : the new brain repository aims to better understand traumatic brain injury amongst members of the armed services in addition to servicemen and women , the effects of protein accumulation are often seen amongst boxers and football players , or anyone who 's suffered multiple head trauma - and it often disturbs brain function			0
' we have been at war for more than a decade and our men and women have sacrificed , ' dr. @entity34 , assistant secretary of defense , says in a press release			0
' the military health care system is bringing all the resources it can to better understand how to prevent , diagnose and treat traumatic brain injuries and to ensure that service members have productive and long , quality lives			2
' according to dr. @entity46 , a neuropathologist and director of the brain tissue repository , soldiers ' are coming home with troubling , persistent problems and we do n't know the nature of this , whether it 's related to psychiatric responses from engagement in warfare or related to actual damage to the brain ... ' research : the @entity58 is being funded by a federal grant to advance the understanding and treatment of @entity62 in service members before the government takes any brain tissue to add to the repository , it says it will get permission from the deceased service members ' families			1
