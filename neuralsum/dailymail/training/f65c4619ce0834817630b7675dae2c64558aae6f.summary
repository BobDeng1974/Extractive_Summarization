it may only be november , but @entity2 's chances of achieving anything this season are already looking bleak			1
sunday 's miserable defeat at @entity6 has left them 12 points adrift of pace - setters @entity8 in the @entity10 , while performances in @entity12 have mostly been equally uninspiring			1
sure , there have been injury problems , but many fans believe @entity16 should have done more to add depth to his squad			2
as the pressure again mounts on the @entity21 , we take a look at the important questions being asked of @entity2 and whether they can be addressed			2
@entity2 slipped to defeat at @entity6 on sunday , meaning they are 12 points behind leaders @entity8 questions are again being asked of manager @entity16 as @entity2 's chances of silverware fade per @entity29 is left shell - shocked after the @entity31 ' abject loss at the @entity32 @entity2 are already 12 points behind @entity8 , struggling in @entity12 and out of the @entity34 ... what 's going on at the @entity36 this season ? after ending their nine - year trophy drought by winning the @entity40 and cementing a top - four finish , morale was high heading into the new season			1
unlike previous campaigns , no major players had been sold and @entity16 had captured @entity45 from @entity46			1
the addition of the @entity48 with a comfortable 3 - 0 win against @entity50 left many @entity2 fans giddy and expectant			2
but with only four wins in the league this season - against current bottom - seven sides @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - and two in the @entity58 , against teams ranked only 35th and 44th in @entity12 , @entity52 are feeling rather deflated ... and it 's only november			1
@entity2 ended their nine - year trophy drought when they defeated @entity64 in may 's @entity40 final at @entity66 @entity45 has been a rare positive for @entity2 and he scored his 12th goal of the season on sunday the loss at @entity6 left @entity2 sixth , 12 points behind @entity10 leaders @entity8 injuries have obviously played their part ... yes			1
@entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 have all missed large chunks of the campaign - and in some cases are still out			0
is that why @entity87 is playing at centre half ? it is			0
but @entity16 should have bought more defensive re-inforcements			2
he allowed @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 to leave in the summer and brought in only @entity79 , who has been sidelined since september , and 19 - year - old @entity94 , who was miserably exposed by @entity6 's @entity95			1
@entity87 is as much of a centre half as he is a striker , and it does n't help that @entity29 is suffering from a @entity99 hangover			0
@entity2 have conceded more headed goals than any team bar @entity53 this campaign			2
@entity16 will be desperate for @entity82 to return			2
@entity82 , who has struggled with an achilles injury , has been a big miss for @entity2 @entity87 ( right ) was called into action at centre half again at @entity6 and struggled @entity94 was exposed by the pace of @entity95 in sunday 's match where 's the leadership ? that 's one of the central problems ; there is n't			1
@entity2 inexplicably threw away a three - goal lead against @entity116 after searching for more goals instead of holding what they had			1
and they performed the same suicidal act at the @entity32 on sunday			0
seven @entity2 players were ahead of the ball when they lost possession leading up to @entity6 's equaliser			1
the @entity31 have thrown away more points from a winning position than any other team this season			2
so perhaps @entity128 has a point when he called @entity16 's side ' tactically clueless ' on 11 occasions last week ? @entity16 boasted @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 as his first three captains at @entity2			1
leaders on and off the pitch			0
but his last four have included @entity139 ( histrionic ) , @entity140 ( left for @entity141 ) @entity92 ( injured / out of form ) and @entity78 ( best of a bad bunch )			0
@entity16 reacts with dismay as his team surrender a three - goal lead to draw with @entity116 captain @entity78 limps off during the home draw with @entity116 , the latest of his injury woes who should @entity16 be targeting in january ? he desperately needs a centre half and a holding midfielder to add some much - needed steel to that talented , but attack - minded and arguably flakey midfield			1
@entity156 is interested in a move to the @entity36 and surely @entity16 should have swooped for @entity158 in the summer			2
he has shone at @entity159 this year and was a revelation for the @entity31 before he left for @entity46			0
@entity161 could do a job and what of @entity8 's @entity164 ? he is n't getting a game at @entity166 ... @entity167 's @entity156 is likely to be in demand in january and @entity2 have been linked to him @entity158 has been excellent for @entity169 this season , raising questions as to why @entity16 did n't sign him but some fans are saying it is n't who @entity16 brings in , but his tactics and where he plays those new signings			1
why , for instance , has @entity77 been deployed on the left ? should n't they be building the team around him ? he should			0
in the rare moments @entity77 played at @entity182 , he 's excelled			0
he is n't the same player on the left			0
in his early years , @entity16 built his team around @entity186 , and then @entity134			0
now he seems unsure who his best player is , or indeed what 's his best team			0
in @entity45 , @entity191 , @entity80 , @entity192 , and even @entity77 when he is fit , he has too many players who want to do the same job			0
@entity77 's talents have been wasted playing on the left instead of in the @entity182 role @entity45 has been @entity2 's brightest spark , but is he in a class of one ? the £ 30million man works his socks off and has been involved in seven of @entity2 's last eight goals in the @entity10			1
without him they 'd be even worse off			0
@entity192 has looked a shadow of the player who lit up the @entity10 last term			0
@entity77 , on the left , was desperately short of confidence and form before he got injured			0
@entity211 has done ok , but will never be in the same bracket as @entity186 , @entity134 , or @entity213			0
@entity214 was @entity2 's best player on sunday , but needs a consistent run in the team while @entity191 has gone off the boil and injury - prone @entity80 is struggling for form			1
@entity45 looks exasperated with his team - mates as a move breaks down against @entity6 @entity211 has performed fairly well this season but is not in the class of @entity134 or @entity186 video we did n't perform until the final whistle - @entity16 @entity2 fans must be worried about @entity8 matching , or even bettering , the @entity226 ? sadly , as with @entity227 , @entity2 fans can only boast about their past			1
as @entity8 have cantered to league and cup titles - not to mention that @entity58 triumph in 2012 - @entity2 have won only the @entity40			1
now @entity233 's juggernaut could go the season unbeaten - probably with more points and fewer defeats			2
that would be an extremely bitter pill for @entity2 supporters to swallow ... @entity16 shows off the @entity10 trophy after his ' @entity241 ' won the title in 2004 more so than @entity243 joining @entity8 in the summer ? he 's been one of the @entity10 's best players this season			1
@entity16 had first refusal , so why did n't he sign him ? @entity243 and @entity77 could not have played in the same side , and when you 've spent a club record fee on a player why would you undermine that by bringing in someone who lines up in the same position ? nor can we forget @entity192 ’s breakthrough campaign last year			0
@entity243 was undoubtedly a star player , who stood head and shoulders above his peers , but he is also one who personified a different @entity16 era – a move away from the power of @entity263 , @entity133 , @entity264 and one built around slighter , diminutive players , albeit as skilful – but which ultimately has proved to be nowhere near as successful			0
despite his success at @entity8 this season , signing him would have been a step back			2
@entity243 has been classy for @entity8 this season but would n't have fitted in at @entity2 some @entity2 supporters were calling for @entity16 to leave after @entity2 's defeat at @entity6			1
is it time for him to go ? @entity2 fans would have been desperate for the club to kick on after last season 's @entity40 triumph , but it appears as though they will be battling only for a top - four finish this season			1
they seem miles short of what is required to launch an assault on the @entity58			0
@entity16 's stubbornness to adapt his tactics when facing bigger teams is alarming			2
so too is the fact that his players do n't seem to understand the concept of defending as a team			0
while his squad must take some responsibility for that , does n't it ultimately fall down to the man who organises them ? no longer can @entity16 , or indeed the fans blame , a lack of spending either			2
more than £ 40m was spent on @entity77 and almost £ 50m on acquiring @entity45 and @entity211			0
is @entity16 's time up at @entity2 ? perhaps ... but do n't expect him to walk away any time soon			1
what should @entity2 fans be hoping for during the remainder of the season ? sadly for them a decent run in the @entity40 , a battle for the top four , and probably an exit from @entity12 at the round of 16 stage when they draw one of the competition ’s top clubs			1
we 've been here before have n't we ?			0

@entity2 lost 2 - 1 at @entity6 on sunday and trail @entity8 by 12 points
their *weaknesses* were exposed by @entity116 in the @entity58
*gunners* *crashed* out of the @entity34 to @entity316 in third round
it 's only november but pressure is already mounting on @entity16 - his tactics have been openly *criticised* by fans and *pundits* alike
only @entity45 has been consistently good this season
