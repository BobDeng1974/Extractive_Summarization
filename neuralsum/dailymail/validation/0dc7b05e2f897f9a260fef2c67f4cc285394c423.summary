higher earners are to benefit from the first real terms rise in the 40p tax threshold for seven years			1
in a surprise move , the chancellor announced a modest ‘ down payment ’ on @entity7 plans to raise the bracket for paying higher - rate tax to £ 50,000			1
@entity10 vowed last year to end the scandal of so - called ‘ fiscal drag ’ , which has seen millions dragged into paying 40p tax by freezing and cutting the starting threshold			1
but mr @entity27 cheered @entity7 mps by announcing a series of modest increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years , culminating in a 1.4 per cent rise in 2017 – just above the forecast inflation rate of 1.2 per cent			1
married couples have gained from an increase in the transferrable tax allowance			0
the chancellor announced that the amount a spouse can transfer to their partner is being raised by £ 50 – in line with the rise in the personal income tax allowance			1
the tax break comes into force on april 1			0
it was originally planned that married couples in which one person earned under the £ 10,500 income tax threshold would be allowed to transfer £ 1,050 of their allowance to their spouse			2
now that the personal allowance has been raised , the chancellor ’s move means that taxpayers will be able to transfer £ 1,100 of their allowance to their spouse – an increase of £ 50			1
as a result , couples will be able to save around £ 220 a year			0
@entity60 have said they will scrap the tax break if they win the election			0
in his speech , @entity27 said : ‘ in this budget the rate of the new transferable tax allowance for married couples will rise to £ 1,100			2
that ’s the allowance coming in just two weeks ’ time to help over 4million couples – help that @entity60 would take away , but we on this side are proud to provide			2
’ it only applies to couples in which there is one basic rate taxpayer , with the other earning less than the personal allowance			2
the @entity77 said that stay - at - home parents and those who work part - time would be the biggest beneficiaries from the change			0
the plans mean that the income at which the higher rate is payable will rise from £ 41,865 to £ 42,385 in april 2015 , £ 42,700 in april 2016 and £ 43,300 in april 2017			1
treasury aides said the number of people dragged in to paying higher - rate tax would be 100,000 lower as a result			2
the changes in the basic rate and 40p thresholds will be included in the @entity94 that will be pushed through the @entity95 in the coming days			0
but they could be reversed by an incoming @entity60 government if @entity98 wins power in may			0
@entity60 has been silent on 40p tax , giving no indication that it would raise the threshold			2
mr @entity27 also announced that , unlike in some previous years , higher - rate taxpayers will benefit in full from another planned increase in the personal allowance			1
the chancellor said the allowance – the starting point for paying income tax – would rise to £ 11,000 by 2017 , from its planned level of £ 10,600 next month			1
the changes announced yesterday are worth £ 80 to basic - rate taxpayers and £ 172 to those paying the 40p rate , and will cost the @entity115 £ 1.6billion by 2017			1
treasury sources said 27million people will receive a tax cut and 3.7million be taken out of income tax altogether as a result of the new thresholds			0
the decision to raise the personal allowance to £ 11,000 takes a big step towards mr @entity10 ’s pledge to raise it to £ 12,500 by 2020 if the @entity7 win the election			1
the announcements confirm that the @entity7 will have to implement massive rises in the 40p threshold in the later years of the next parliament in order to hit mr @entity10 ’s £ 50,000 pledge			1
the number of people paying 40p tax has risen by around three million to five million since 2010 , as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by @entity60			1
ministers initially cut the threshold for paying 40p tax and then raised it more slowly than inflation			1
the threshold is also the starting point at which families with a relatively high earner start to lose their child benefit payments			0
many @entity7 mps now want ministers to move further and faster on the issue if the party wins the election			0
treasury sources described yesterday ’s announcement as a ‘ down payment ’ on future increases , and pointed out that levels could be revised upwards at subsequent budgets if @entity77 win the may 7 election			0
an aide to the chancellor insisted that hitting mr @entity10 ’s targets by 2020 would be ‘ affordable ’ in the context of the £ 7billion surplus which the government is forecast to be running by the last year of the @entity166			1
he added : ‘ we have shown during this @entity166 that we are able to cut taxes and reduce the deficit at the same time			0
’ @entity170 and @entity171 are among the 27million individuals to benefit from the rise in tax - free personal allowance			1
from next month , workers can earn £ 10,600 before having to pay income tax			0
the limit was set to rise to £ 10,800 but will now be increased further to £ 11,000			0
it means lower earners like 33 - year - old mr @entity180 , who makes £ 11,000 as a trainee public relations officer , will be lifted out of paying income tax altogether			1
@entity170 and @entity171 , pictured with their children , are among 27million individuals to benefit from rise in tax - free personal allowance his wife , who earns £ 24,000 as a part - time accounts assistant , will also stand to benefit by taking home more of her salary			1
mrs @entity171 said : ‘ this was a great budget for us			0
' the raise in personal allowance will mean i get to keep more of what i earn and it ’ll mean more for my husband , who ’d be lifted out of income tax completely			2
’ the couple are trying to save for a house while also juggling the cost of childcare for their two children , five - year - old @entity206 and two - year - old @entity207			0
they said the changes will help boost their finances			0
‘ it ’ll give us a little bit extra in the long term , ’ mrs @entity171 added			2
‘ another thing that will affect us is the @entity216 for first - time buyers			0
' the higher personal allowance will give us more money to save , and the new @entity216 will give us a better way of saving			2
