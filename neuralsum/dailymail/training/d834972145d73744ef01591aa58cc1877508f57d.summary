@entity0 has played it safe when predicting which teams will reach the last - 16 of this month 's @entity3			1
the @entity5 boss , clearly keen to keep friends over here onside , said that @entity8 will progress out of their group alongside @entity10			2
that means the @entity12 believes @entity13 and @entity14 will fail to get out of one of the tougher - looking groups			2
' if i say @entity8 out , next season they wo n't let me coach here			0
' there was a recurring theme to his choices , with the personalities and countries closest to the manager 's heart unsurprisingly going through			0
@entity55 's @entity29 , @entity56 's @entity30 and @entity33 are all predicted to get out of their respective groups			1
interestingly in @entity29 's group - where they will play @entity20 , @entity61 and @entity62 - @entity0 claims the favourites will go through , but that the @entity64 could easily finish in the top two			1
at the forefront : @entity55 is good friends with @entity0 after a spell in charge at @entity70 as for his native @entity41 , @entity0 is backing them to edge out @entity71 and @entity72 to finish second behind @entity34 in a group where he expects no team will finish on zero points			0
meanwhile , he is expecting @entity32 - who have won one @entity3 group match in 12 years - to perform much better this time around and win their group ahead of @entity39 .			0

@entity12 tips @entity29 to get out of @entity82 with @entity20
@entity0 does n't believe @entity13 and @entity14 will progress
@entity8 to face @entity56 's @entity30 in his last - 16
@entity87 's semi-final would be against either @entity28 or @entity29
