giant pandas have a short 36 - hour window just once a year within which to breed when the female panda is ovulating			1
male panda @entity5 and female @entity2 were introduced to each other during breeding season last year at @entity11 , but the pair failed to mate			1
zoo workers hope male panda @entity5 ( pictured at @entity11 ) will mate with female panda @entity2 when she comes into fertility season within the next 10 days @entity5 has been kept apart from @entity2 since last year when the pair showed no interest in each other members of the public look on at @entity5 , the male panda who it is hoped will mate soon at @entity11 the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) revealed that @entity2 will be in heat within the next eight days after tests showed the necessary hormonal crossover in progesterone and oestrogen had occurred			1
throughout the rest of the year the two giant pandas are kept apart because they are naturally territorial and could attack one another			2
@entity30 , director of giant pandas , said : ‘ we are now able to predict that the important 36 - hour breeding window when both pandas are likely to meet is imminent			0
‘ scientific results alone would suggest the day is just less than 10 days away ; however , as @entity2 's behavioural changes are coming in so strongly , we can not rule out that the key 36 - hour window may be much sooner			1
‘ every individual giant panda is different and this is only the second time @entity2 has come into season in @entity40 , so it is difficult to make a precise prediction at this stage			2
‘ the next steps are to continue behavioural observational and hormone testing to confirm when the annual window has arrived			0
’ @entity2 and @entity5 are the first giant pandas to live in the @entity4 for 17 years			0
@entity5 will have a window of just 36 hours to mate with female giant panda @entity2 when she becomes fertile in the next 10 days although @entity2 will give birth to two cubs if she mates with @entity5 only one is likely to suvive @entity11 , where the pair have lived since their arrival from @entity56 in december 2011 , has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas , including controlled lighting , urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping			1
mr @entity30 said : ‘ when the 36 - hour window is here , @entity2 and @entity5 will meet several times to have the opportunity to mate and then , as @entity2 finally ovulates and her hormones fall off , artificial insemination will also take place			2
’ if @entity2 does fall pregnant , it will be july or the first half of august when @entity11 experts will be able to confirm it by using ultrasound scans			0
the majority of giant panda cubs are born at the very end of august or beginning of september			0
although females may give birth to two young , usually only one survives			0
the giant pandas ’ naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population in the wild from recovering quickly from illegal hunting , habitat loss , and other human - related causes of mortality			0
in the wild the diet of giant pandas like @entity5 ( pictured in @entity11 ) is 99 per cent made up of bamboo zoo goers hope that the two pandas will mate this year and produce a panda cub as a new edition to @entity11			2

female panda @entity2 is eight days away from short annual fertility window
pandas were *encouraged* to mate last year but failed to do so
pandas are kept apart outside of mating season because they would attack
