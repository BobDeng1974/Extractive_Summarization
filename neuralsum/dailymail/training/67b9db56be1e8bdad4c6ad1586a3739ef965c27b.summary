@entity0 shipped a half - century of points for the second time in six days as @entity2 ran in seven tries as they claimed a 53 - 26 victory in front of a record crowd at the @entity7			1
the visitors scored four tries themselves and showed far more heart in defence than in their traumatic 52 - nil defeat at home to @entity15			0
but their return to the @entity17 could hardly have begun more unpromisingly			0
@entity2 ’s playmaker , @entity18 , was near faultless from the kicking tee , missing only one conversion and also landing two penalties for an 18 - point haul			2
@entity2 fly - half @entity18 kicked 18 points during their dominant victory over @entity0 his half - back partner , @entity27 , given his first @entity17 start , scored within two minutes and other tries followed from @entity30 ( two ) , @entity31 ( two ) , @entity32 and @entity33			1
the @entity35 tries were scored by @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , with skipper @entity40 , who spent eight seasons in all at @entity7 , converting three			1
@entity27 ’s try , after just 84 seconds , owed much to @entity43 ’ muscular burst through two tackles and @entity47 ’s inside track in support			0
he was brought down just short of the posts by former @entity2 player @entity50 but scrum - half @entity27 followed up to touch down and @entity18 added the conversion			1
@entity0 were back on terms within a couple of minutes as lock @entity55 finished off a move involving @entity40 , @entity38 and flanker @entity57 landed the extra points			2
@entity18 , who had kicked seven out of seven on the opening weekend at @entity59 , was accurate with an eighth - minute penalty , awarded for a scrum offence by @entity35 ’ tighthead @entity62			0
given another straightforward chance , the young fly - half opted instead for a tap - and - go but @entity66 was stopped just of the line			1
despite a decided advantage in the scrums , @entity2 ’s attacking rhythm was being disrupted by knock - ons and spilled passes			0
eventually , @entity73 rescued a faltering move on the @entity0 22 , easing outside @entity55 ’s flailing tackle to create the overlap for @entity30 to score in the right corner			2
there was a worrying moment or two for the @entity2 faithful as the fly - half received treatment on his shoulder but he banged over the conversion from the touchline to put @entity2 17 - 7 ahead at the end of the first quarter			1
@entity89 was one of two players alongside @entity31 to score a brace of tries @entity33 completed the try scoring for @entity2 at the @entity7 @entity40 missed a 45 - metre penalty at the other end before @entity2 extended their lead with a third try on the half hour			1
the @entity0 defence was a far more aggressive and capable unit this weekend but was undone , first by @entity101 ’s dancing feet , and then by @entity31 ’s neat grubber , the centre snaffling the ball under @entity37 ’s nose to touch down			2
@entity106 quickly got his own back , wriggling out of @entity113 ’s tackle to win the @entity109 decision and @entity40 ’s kick cut the margin to one score			0
but @entity73 ended the half with another penalty for a 27 - 14 lead			0
within five minutes of the restart , number eight @entity117 profited from a catch - and - drive , with @entity73 accurate as ever from the tee			0
it looked as if they would score again straightaway but @entity37 led a rousing counter-attack and full - back @entity38 cantered to the line at the other end			2
@entity2 responded with an intercept score by @entity30 as @entity39 tried to offload in a tackle just outside his 22			1
but @entity2 were equally generous at the other end as replacement hooker @entity131 threw long on his own line and it was a relieved @entity39 who snapped up the chance to earn a four - try bonus point			0
@entity30 ’s pace and power had been a constant threat and after he had busted through the tiring @entity0 defence on 71 minutes , @entity18 fed @entity31 for his second try and @entity2 ’s sixth			1
for once , the fly - half ’s kick was off target - but only just			1
@entity33 brought up the 50 by barging through to the posts from a tapped penalty .			0

fly - half @entity18 scores 18 points as @entity2 win *comfortably*
@entity27 , @entity30 ( two ) , @entity31 ( two ) , @entity32 and @entity33 go over for the home side
@entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 score tries for @entity0 as they *concede* 50 *+* for the second time in a week
