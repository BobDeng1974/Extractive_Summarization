@entity1 soldiers are responsible for the massacre of 300 muslims at @entity4 in the 1995 @entity6 war and must pay their families compensation , a court has ruled			1
peacekeepers from the @entity1 who were meant to be guarding the town turned away the victims from their compound in the village of @entity14 during the bloody conflict and handed them over to @entity17 forces			1
they were then killed by the @entity18 led by general @entity19 - who is himself on trial for war crimes			2
the court ruled that the @entity1 peacekeeping troops could have protected the 300 - plus men and boys who were among thousands of @entity3 - mainly women , children and elderly people - taking shelter in a @entity1 compound inside the @entity50 safe haven of @entity4			1
the troops - part of a @entity1 @entity54 battalion known as @entity37 - handed over those in the compound two days after the town fell			2
the @entity17 troops then killed the @entity3 men and boys , who ' would have survived if @entity37 had acted properly , ' said presiding judge @entity60			2
in total 8,000 were killed at @entity4 , although the court cleared the @entity1 of responsibility for the other 7,700 deaths			1
investigations : an excavator is pictured in 2005 excavating a body believed to be one of the @entity4 victims who was transported to a distant mass grave the court said the @entity1 was not liable for the deaths of those who had fled into the forests surrounding @entity4 , where many of the men and boys were later buried in mass graves			1
although those people had protection in the @entity54 safe haven they were never directly in the custody of the @entity1 troops , the court ruled			1
' @entity37 can not be held liable for their fate , ' the ruling read			0
in an emotionally - charged hearing attended by a handful of victims ' relatives , the judge said the peacekeepers should have known that the men taken from the compound would be slain because there was already evidence of the @entity96 committing war crimes			1
' by co-operating in the deportation of these men , @entity37 acted unlawfully , ' judge @entity98 said			0
the ruling could set a precedent with implications for future peacekeeping deployments by the @entity1 or other countries			2
it could be appealed , however , meaning it is unlikely to resolve the @entity1 national trauma over the country 's role in the worst massacre on @entity113 soil since the @entity114			2
during the @entity6 war , the @entity1 battalion @entity37 had been deployed to protect @entity4 , which had been designated a safe haven by the @entity54			1
but on july 13 , 1995 , the peacekeepers bowed to pressure from @entity17 forces commanded by @entity121 and forced thousands of @entity3 families out of their fenced - off compound			1
evidence : this video , shown at the trial of former @entity96 president @entity127 , was said to show victims of the killings along with @entity96 soldiers the @entity17 forces sorted the @entity3 by gender , then drove the males away and began killing them in what would become the bloody climax to the 1992 - 95 @entity6 war , a slaughter that international courts have ruled was genocide			1
the war claimed 100,000 lives in all , and was the bloodiest of a series of conflicts that accompanied the break - up of @entity146 in the 1990s			0
the @entity4 bodies were piled into hastily - made mass graves , which were later bulldozed and scattered among other burial sites in an attempt to hide the evidence			0
the case was brought by the @entity153 , a group representing surviving relatives of the victims			0
they had failed in their bid to have a court find the @entity54 responsible for the massacre			0
' at the moment that the men were sent away , @entity37 knew or should have known that the genocide was taking place and therefore there was a serious risk that those men would be killed , ' said judge @entity167			0
the failure of @entity1 soldiers to protect the @entity3 men and boys of @entity4 had deep repercussions , contributing to the resignation of the @entity1 government in 2002			1
relatives of the dead welcomed the limited finding of liability but lamented that it did not go further			0
' obviously the court has no sense of justice , ' said @entity183 , president of mothers of @entity4			0
' how is it possible to divide victims , and tell one mother that the @entity1 state is responsible for the death of her son on one side of the wire and not for the son on the other side ? ' the court did not say how much compensation the families should receive , and the figure will be worked out between lawyers and the @entity1 government once any appeals have run their course			1
a lawyer for the relatives , @entity202 , said he would study the 89 - page ruling before deciding whether to appeal			0
it remains to be seen what effect the ruling will have on @entity54 recruitment for peacekeeping missions			0
@entity211 spokesman @entity210 said the @entity1 government began insisting on stricter safeguards for its troops involved in @entity54 missions after the @entity4 massacre , but would not speculate on whether wednesday 's ruling would have a further impact			2
' what this means for future missions , i ca n't say , ' he said .			0
