the first portraits created from @entity2 scans of a sitting president are going on display at the @entity5			1
digital imaging specialists at the @entity5 created a @entity2 printed bust and life mask of president @entity9 this year			1
the portraits were first shown at the @entity10 during a gathering of inventors , entrepreneurs and students			0
first ever : a 3d printed bust of president @entity9 went on display at the @entity19 , along with life masks that were also printed in plastic life masks : the president 's life mask , here with masks made of president @entity24 ( left and center ) and his bust are made out of thousands of layers of plastic melted together using lasers the portraits went on display tuesday at the @entity19			1
they will be on view through december			0
the president 's face was scanned by experts from the @entity41 's @entity40			0
the photo shoot included 50 custom - built led lights , eight sports photography cameras and six wide angle cameras to gather the data needed for the 3d image of president @entity9			1
the @entity5 team then used handheld @entity47 scanners and traditional single - lens reflex cameras to record peripheral @entity47 data to create an accurate bust			1
the bust was @entity2 printed using a laser to melt plastic together in 5,000 layers			1
it took 40 hours to print , and because it 's plastic , the material will be durable over time , said image specialist @entity60			1
high tech : the photo shoot ( pictured ) included 50 custom - built led lights , eight sports photography cameras and six wide angle cameras to gather the data needed for the @entity47 of president @entity9 scanners : the actual scanning took about 5 minutes			1
the result was a 3d scan of the president at a higher resolution that is currently possible to print in 3d lifelike masks are nothing new , of course , though the technology is			2
plaster masks were created of @entity74 and @entity24 's faces during their lives , and they are kept in the @entity5 collection			1
' we were really inspired by our experience with the @entity24 life masks , ' said @entity81 , director of the @entity5 's digitization program			1
the group has made 3d scans and prints to replicate the original @entity24 masks from early and late in the @entity87			0
they have proven especially popular with school groups using the @entity5 's 3d scans			1
' there 's a very , very deep connection that gets made when you have accurate data of a person 's face and that person was a part of history , ' @entity81 said			0
' people really felt the @entity24 life masks deeply spoke to them and connected them to a place , a time , a life and ultimately a legacy of the 14th president			2
' the group has made 3d scans and prints to replicate original plaster - cast @entity24 masks from early and late in the @entity87			2
they have proven especially popular with school groups using the @entity5 's 3d scans			1
the portraits went on display tuesday at the @entity19			0
they will be on view through december but past presidential masks were created through plaster casting that required a president to sit with plaster on his face , breathing through straws stuck in his nose			2
so the @entity5 set out to update that process with 21st century technology to make it fast and easy			1
the team proposed a scan of @entity9 in 2013 , and the @entity10 agreed			2
@entity9 joined them for about 15 minutes in the @entity10			2
the actual scanning took about 5 minutes			0
the result was a 3d scan of the president at a higher resolution that is currently possible to print in @entity2			0
' you can see down to the wrinkles in the skin and the pores on his face , ' said @entity139 , a 3d imaging specialist			0
for centuries , artists have used the latest technology to create imagery of leaders , whether it was busts chiseled out of marble , paintings or photographs			0
' we think we 've really added a new genre to portraiture , ' @entity81 said			0
' it will be fascinating to see how that will be picked up and how down the line other administrations will also use that particular tool			0
' ultra-realistic : the plastic material makes the portraits very durable and also ultra-realistic			0
the president 's face was scanned and replicated down to the tiniest wrinkles			0

digital imaging specialists at the @entity5 in @entity74 created a 3d bust and life mask of president @entity9 this year
the photo shoot included 50 custom - built led lights , eight sports photography cameras and six wide angle cameras
