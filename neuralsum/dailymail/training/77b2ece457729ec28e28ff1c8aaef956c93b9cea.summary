by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:21 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 10:58 est , 29 august 2012 the earliest surviving portrait of @entity3 in @entity4			1
archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in @entity8			2
archaeologists digging under a council car park in @entity8 where they believe @entity3 may be buried have made their first breakthrough			1
a team from the @entity13 has revealed that just days into the dig , they have found a wall that could form part of the friary where the last medieval king of @entity19 was buried			1
' the remains are very possibly medieval walls but this is subject to confirmation today , ' the team said			2
' we will also seek to establish if these are part of the medieval @entity28 site where @entity3 was buried			1
' @entity29 of the @entity13 , who is leading the dig , said : ' the search for @entity3 goes on - it is still a long shot , but the archaeological work we have done so far is revealing more about the archaeology of the @entity28 area than we ever knew before			1
' in that respect , whatever the outcome - whether we find @entity3 or not - this work is an advance in terms of helping us to tell the story of the city of @entity8			1
the dig is being filmed for a forthcoming @entity43 documentary to be aired later this year			2
the team has so far dug a trench 30 metres long , removing the modern car park surface and hard core formation , and machining through 18th and 19th - century garden soils to get down to the top of the medieval layer - around 1.5 metres below present ground level			0
the researchers believe @entity3 was buried in a @entity55 friary in the area after being killed by the army of @entity58 during the @entity59 in 1485			1
the friary was , however , knocked down during @entity62 ’s dissolution of the monasteries , and the exact location of the burial site has been one of @entity68 ’s enduring historical mysteries ever since			0
last week , they began digging it up			0
@entity3 was @entity3 of @entity19 for two years , from 1483 until the @entity59			1
his death at the age of 32 marked the end of 30 years of civil war , known as the @entity90 , and the end of the middle ages			0
it also marked the dawn of the @entity58 dynasty and the demise of the @entity97			0
his clothes and armour were removed and his naked body carried on horseback to @entity8 , where the corpse was displayed in public for three days			0
he was then buried in the @entity55 friary , known as @entity28 , but just over 50 years later the church was destroyed			1
@entity105 uses ground penetration radar ( @entity107 ) at @entity28 car park in @entity8 as the search for @entity110 remains gets underway in a field behind @entity113 near @entity8 , the treeline marks the spot where @entity3 is believed to have been killed in battle			1
the 69p stamp featuring @entity3 born in 1452 , @entity3 was @entity3 of @entity19 for two years , from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the @entity59			1
according to another tale , @entity3 consulted a seer in @entity8 before the battle who foretold that ' where your spur should strike on the ride into battle , your head shall be broken on the return '			1
on the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the @entity131 ; legend has it that , as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse , his head struck the same stone and was broken @entity139 was the last @entity19 king to be killed in battle he was the last king of the @entity142 and the last of the @entity97 dynasty			0
although @entity3 has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a hunchback and a withered arm , most historians now claim such an image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by @entity151			1
legend says the body was removed and cast into the @entity154 , but historians hope to prove wrong this disputed version of events by finding it at the council site			0
the archaeologists , from @entity13 , along with members of the @entity162 , hope finding the remains will help to change the way the monarch is viewed historically			1
@entity3 is traditionally seen as a tyrant who murdered his way to the throne , disfigured by a hunchback and a withered arm			1
many historians , however , claim that a distorted image of the king was deliberately created by the @entity174 , the most notorious example of which is @entity151 ’s play about him			0
the @entity162 said it hoped the excavation , which is projected to last two weeks , would end ‘ the enormous disparagement ’ of his reputation			0
the site of the friary was bought by @entity184 @entity183 , the mayor of @entity8 , in 1612 , after the church was demolished in 1538			0
he built a mansion there			0
in 1914 , @entity188 bought the land , later turning it into a car park			0
archaeologists will start by digging two long trenches across the car park , hoping to find remains of the church and narrow down the search			2
they will also use ground - penetrating radar to find the best places to dig. @entity29 , co-director of the @entity199 at the university , said : ‘ it is quite a long shot but it ’s a very exciting project			0
we do n’t know precisely where the body would have been buried but we suspect it would be in the choir or near the altar			0
’ if bones are found they will be assessed for trauma to the skeleton			2
@entity3 was hacked down after being surrounded and one historical account suggests that the blow which finally felled him was so hard that fragments of his helmet were left in his skull			1
they will also be subjected to dna analysis			1
the remains will be matched against the @entity217 of @entity219 , a 16th generation descendant of @entity220 , the sister of @entity3 mrs @entity219 died four years ago , aged 82			1
at the site yesterday , mrs @entity219 ’s son @entity221 , 55 , watched as the search began			0
the furniture - maker , who was born in @entity226 but now lives in @entity227 , said his mother would have been thrilled by the project			0
‘ the family were entertained when she got the call several years ago from a historian claiming she was a descendant , ’ he added			0
the @entity233 , medieval silver - gilt livery badge of @entity3 , helped researchers pinpoint the location of the battle of @entity59 when is was found in east @entity237 in 1999 archaeologist dr @entity238 shows today how the badge of the boar led them to pinpoint the battlefield and where the king fell			1
' this is almost certainly from a knight in @entity3 's retinue , who rode with him to his death on that last charge , ' he said a flag and memorial stone mark @entity252 , just northwest of @entity253 memorial : the plaque at the place where @entity3 is believed to have been killed a depiction of the carnage during the @entity59 by 18th century painter @entity258 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity59 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity90 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity142 and @entity262			1
one of the most important clashes in @entity19 history , it saw the death of @entity3 , ushered in the @entity58 dynasty and gave @entity151 one of his best known quotations			2
the leading role has been played by @entity271 and sir @entity272 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity142 king @entity3 and his challenger @entity58 , @entity279 and @entity280			2
the seeds of @entity3 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity284 in 1483			2
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity284 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity3 was involved in the death of his wife			2
@entity58 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity43			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity19 from his base in @entity293 , @entity58 arrived on the coast of @entity295 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity3 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity58 's army south of @entity299 in @entity300			2
after @entity3 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity58 and became the first @entity19 monarch of the @entity58 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			2

@entity308 has uncovered a wall that could be part of the @entity310 , known as @entity28
if remains are found , they will undergo dna analysis at the @entity13 to confirm that they are those of @entity3
