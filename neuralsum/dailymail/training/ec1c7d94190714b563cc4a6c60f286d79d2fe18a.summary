' i suggest you look at the unedited version online where my emotional states do n't seem to change so arbitrarily , ' he said			2
' the arguments are a little clearer and a little less like a scene from woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown			2
' the unedited version which is on the web had what i thought was the takeaway moment of the entire interview where @entity2 , one of the more respected individuals at @entity3 , basically gives away the game			1
' a clip of the unedited interview then showed @entity0 asking @entity2 if he thought that @entity3 was the ideological equivalent of @entity49			1
' i believe that we 're the counterweight , ' @entity2 responded in the unedited version of the show			1
' i think that they have a liberal agenda and i think we the the other side of the story			2

the conversation started jovially , with mr @entity2 joking to @entity0 : ' after months of evasion , disconnected phone numbers and press agents saying ' who are you again ' it appears he has run out of excuses			1
' there were even jokes about the sparring partners drinking from two @entity3 branded mugs , with mr @entity0 suggesting the water may in fact be poisoned			1
but the atmosphere quickly turned serious as mr @entity0 , angered by questions over his own ' liberal ' bias , snapped			0
the audience were shown a transcript of mr @entity0 describing @entity3 as a , ' relentless agenda - driven 24 hour news opinion propaganda delivery system			1
' mr @entity0 later erupted : ' you 're insane ... here 's the difference between you and i. ' i 'm a comedian first			0
my comedy is informed by an ideological background , there 's no question about that			0
' @entity0 began his own show on monday evening by telling viewers that he had been to the nation 's capital and taken another ' classic ' picture of himself			0
viewers were then showed a picture of him posing crudely in front of the @entity107			0
but he moved quickly onto attacking @entity3 over the previous evening 's interview			1
after playing the part of the interview where @entity2 apparently admits @entity3 has a right - wing bias , @entity0 then parodies the station			1
' the other side of the story			0
'' we do n't tell both sides of the story , we tell one side ... the other side , the one we perceive is never told			0
because as you know , news only comes in two sides			0
