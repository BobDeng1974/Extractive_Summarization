a @entity1 author is going to extreme lengths to get a better understanding of his characters to pen his novels from taking part in military training - which saw him kidnapped and tortured by electrocution - to scaling rooftops in @entity12			1
@entity13 , 31 , has written three thriller books by drawing from his wild and sometimes unbelievable experiences			1
he wrote his first book when he was 10 years old but did not become serious about writing until he completed a stint in the @entity19 and studied film and television			0
@entity1 - based @entity13 , 31 , puts himself in life - threatening scenarios to understand his characters pictured here scaling rooftops in @entity12 , mr @entity13 immerses himself in the worlds of his novels			1
he has written three thriller books @entity13 said he was not a ' professional ' writer until 2012 when his first book , @entity27 , was published			1
soon the @entity28 and @entity29 followed			0
as part of his research for these novels and upcoming ones , @entity13 decided to take an escape and evasion course in november 2012 in @entity36			1
during the week - long course , which is taken by @entity39 and @entity40 , the author learned how to escape capture , pick locks , steal a car and how to disguise himself from @entity44 - the @entity45 agent @entity44 portrayed in biopic @entity46			1
at the end of the week , he had to apply the skills he had acquired , except for stealing a car because they still ' had to operate within in law '			0
' i was tied up in a motel in @entity54 in @entity36 with the heat turned up and @entity57 television on in the background , ' @entity13 told @entity59			1
' i was hooded and then waterboarded [ a form of torture ] and electrocuted - not too much but just enough to experience it - to experience the mental side of it and learning not to panic			2
' part of the course included the use of paper clips and other tools that could be concealed and used to escape captivity @entity13 said he went on these adventures to be able to get inside of his characters ' heads and understand how they would get out of certain situations in june , @entity13 met someone who took him onto the rooftops of @entity78 in @entity12 another scenario involved him being taped up , handcuffed and hooded as well as being tied up to two other people on a bed where they had five minutes to escape while concealing paper clips and other tools they could use to free themselves on their bodies			1
@entity13 said he went on these adventures to be able to get inside of his characters ' heads and understand how they would get out of certain situations			1
' my characters are more intelligent and more trained than i am and using skills to outwit each other and that 's a major challenge , ' he said			2
' you can get around that by just looking stuff up but ... it only takes you so far			0
' it 's good to experience all the different things and skills these characters know and put myself in their shoes and learn as much as i can			2
the novel writer says you can only get so far by researching scenarios from a computer or office two years ago , he met an urban explorer who took him underground to explore @entity110 's abandoned subway stations ' and it has taken me to some different places and learn very different things			1
' more recently in june , @entity13 met a guy who was keen to show him a different view of @entity116 in @entity12 , but he did not know it would mean risking his life			1
' there are official tours where they take to buildings and they are not dangerous at all , whereas he took us all the way up and knew the ones that were unlocked and you could get in , ' @entity13 said			1
' he took us up fire escapes			0
they were quite steep and high and they went all the way up , almost to the roof			0
' he jumps off them like in parkour movies and we waited for him to open a window for us			0
' but he poked his head over the edge and dropped down an electrical cord and said : " come on up			0
" ' i thought " this could be it " because the cord was not dangling directly over the fire escapes , so if we fell , we would fall to the ground			0
it was very nerve - wracking			2
' apart from being illegal , the venture was highly dangerous because the subways were still active mr @entity13 decsribed the experience as terrifying : ' i hoped he got the timing right			2
but we got there before the next train came ' but this is not the only close shave , @entity13 has had			2
two years ago , he met an urban explorer who took him underground to explore @entity110 's abandoned subway stations			1
' it 's not legal to do this			0
another urban explorer popped out of a manhole once and people called police because they thought he was a terrorist , ' @entity13 said			2
what made it so dangerous was the fact the railway lines , he and the explorer were walking along were still active			0
' the tunnels are narrow so there 's nowhere to get away from trains , ' he said			0
' we would climb down from the platform then basically run through the tunnel			0
' i was terrified because i hoped he got the timing right			0
but we got there before the next train came			0
