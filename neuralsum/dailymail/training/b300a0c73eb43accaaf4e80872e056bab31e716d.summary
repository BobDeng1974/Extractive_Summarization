passengers who were hit by a vomiting bug that ‘ ruined ’ their eight - day cruise to @entity3 are taking legal action against @entity5			1
the luxury voyage to the @entity7 had to be cut short after the stomach virus – believed to be norovirus – left hundreds of guests suffering from symptoms of a gastroenteritis - type illness on board the @entity14			1
@entity15 , one of the passengers who has contacted lawyers , claims he was confined to his cabin with diarrhoea , stomach cramps and fever			1
passengers said their voyage to the @entity7 fjords on board the @entity14 ( pictured ) was ' ruined ' @entity15 , 66 , said he was so ill that he was confined to his cabin for half of the journey mr @entity15 , from @entity28 , said he continues to suffer as a result of the illness			1
the 66 - year - old retired sales service engineer said : ‘ the illness just completely ruined our holiday – i was hoping to see so many sights but my illness meant that i had to cancel excursions and i spent half of the trip quarantined in my cabin			2
‘ this has affected more than just our holiday , as i am still struggling with illness symptoms now which are preventing me from getting on with my day - to - day life			1
‘ i am extremely frustrated by what i have been through and feel that i deserve answers as to why what was supposed to be a relaxing cruise , was completely turned upside down by illness			2
’ the outbreak was so bad the luxury voyage to the @entity7 fjords had to be cut short by a day retired engineer @entity53 , 86 , described the experience as ‘ dreadful ’ and estimated ‘ more than 300 people ’ fell ill. the outbreak on the ship – which was carrying 1,163 passengers , all paying between £ 799 and £ 1,649 per person – was so bad that it returned to its home port a day early to be ‘ systematically sanitised ’ ahead of its next trip , a 13 - night cruise from the @entity66 island of @entity67			1
it is not the first time @entity71 cruise passengers have been hit by gastric illnesses			1
between october 2009 and may 2010 , 130 passengers fell ill on its cruise liner @entity76 , a sister ship of that involved in the latest incident			2
in 2014 , the company paid out £ 280,000 compensation to those affected			2
in march and april 2011 , 12 passengers sailing around the @entity84 became ill , again on @entity76 , with some later given £ 10,000 payouts			0
then in 2013 , the company reported an outbreak of ' a gastroenteritis - type illness ' on @entity76 after it left @entity88 for a 10 - night ' @entity89 '			1
in that case , 72 passengers were affected			0
@entity71 has said all its ships meet the highest standards of health , safety and hygiene at all times			0
@entity98 claims it has been contacted by multiple passengers , including mr @entity100 , who went on the cruise , which began on may 3 in @entity103			1
a @entity5 spokeswoman claimed mr @entity15 reported his symptoms to staff 11 hours after they surfaced , ‘ during which time it was likely that he was able to spread the illness to others ’			0
the spokeswoman added : ‘ @entity5 stresses to all guests the importance of making staff aware of any illness as a matter of urgency , in order to enable the most effective containment measures on board			0
‘ sadly , mr @entity15 did not do so and we were therefore not aware that he had become ill until much later			0
’ @entity120 , @entity5 ’ sales and marketing director , told @entity123 : ‘ we are sorry that mr @entity15 ’s cruise was impacted by what appears to be norovirus			0
‘ investigations into the outbreak are ongoing , but it appears that – almost certainly – the illness was spread by one guest , as the single source , whilst waiting at the @entity133			1
‘ @entity134 is highly contagious , more so than the common cold , and could easily have been passed on at this time , meaning that more than one person may have boarded the ship with the illness ; they were , most probably , unaware that they had picked up norovirus			0
' @entity5 issues pre-screening health questionnaires at the time of boarding , which need to be signed by all guests to confirm that they are not suffering from any illness , and no guest declared any symptoms at this time			0
' @entity98 said it has launched an investigation into the source of the passengers ’ symptoms			0
@entity152 , a partner at @entity98 , said : ‘ we are very concerned by these reports and have already been contacted for help by passengers affected by the reported illness problems on board the @entity14 cruise ship			1
‘ whilst it is welcome that steps have been taken to deep clean the ship ahead of its next voyage , all of those on board the vessel during this outbreak will be keen to understand how the illness problems developed			1
the luxury cruise ship ( pictured ) had nurses going between cabins handing out tablets to the sick ‘ anyone heading on a cruise expects a relaxing break , yet we see time and time again how illness on such vessels can not only affect people ’s holidays but also go on to leave them with long lasting health issues			2
‘ after being contacted by those affected , we have now commenced our own investigations in an effort to help the passengers obtain the answers they are searching for			2
’ mr @entity120 said @entity5 is ‘ pretty certain ’ the illness was brought onto the ship as the first case was reported within hours of the ship ’s departure from @entity103 , and it takes 12 to 48 hours for norovirus symptoms to appear			2
he added : ‘ otherwise symptoms would have become evident later , as they did on day two and three of the cruise – which is further evidence that it was brought onto the ship on embarkation day and passed onto other guests			2
‘ additionally , we know that the ship had no cases of norovirus on its previous cruise , from @entity207 to @entity103			0
’ @entity71 is offering passengers vouchers for up to 50 per cent off a future voyage to the @entity7 fjords passengers have been offered a refund covering one day 's cost and a voucher for up to 50 per cent off a future voyage			1
additional out - of - pocket expenses would be dealt with ‘ on a case - by - case basis ’ , a spokesperson said previously			0
@entity219 and @entity220 , both 55 , previously said they would never go on a cruise with any company again after falling ill on board the @entity14			0
mr @entity225 added : ‘ we would n't risk the possibility of repeating this experience			0
even if they paid us we would n't go on it			0
