which would you rather win ? the @entity3 quarter - final ? or the derby ? radio phone - ins , newspaper polls , @entity9 squabbles – debate has raged all week on @entity10			1
the reality is , of course , @entity13 , as is their wacky way , will probably either win both or lose both			1
@entity17 's @entity13 face @entity18 in their @entity3 quarter - final on wednesday night the 1955 @entity20 , brought home to @entity13 here , is the last time the club won domestic silverware @entity13 captain @entity25 is raised above boss @entity26 with the @entity20 in 1955 but , for now , it provides a fascinating insight into the mindset of supporters often billed the country ’s longest suffering ( 50,000 every week and no domestic trophy in 60 years is unique , you have to say )			1
on wednesday night their team travel to @entity18 in the last eight of the @entity3			1
it is the first time they have been beyond the fourth round of a domestic cup competition during @entity17 ’s four - year tenure			1
they are two ties from @entity43 , a venue last visited in 2000 when , during an @entity20 semi-final , sir @entity46 ’s team were undone by a double from @entity50 ’s @entity49			2
on sunday , it is @entity49 – a perennial nemesis of the black and whites – who brings @entity55 rivals @entity56 to @entity57			1
@entity49 celebrates scoring @entity50 's second goal during the 2 - 1 @entity20 semi-final defeat in 2000 the now @entity56 boss scored twice to knock sir @entity46 's side out of the competition @entity63 looks downcast as his side are knocked out of the @entity20 by @entity50 at @entity43 @entity13 have lost the last three derbies			1
and therein , perhaps , lies the reason why many supporters are siding with a shot at @entity43 over victory in the derby			0
in a perverse way , they are used to losing the derby now			0
it hurts , of course – some have even punched horses in protest – but the fear of defeat has been realised			0
there is no longer a proud record to protect			0
there will be more derbies , one as soon as early april			0
but cup runs and @entity43 and days out in the capital with @entity88 and @entity89 awash in black and white , now they do n’t come around twice a season			0
@entity17 's @entity13 are looking to bounce back after a 4 - 1 defeat by @entity92 on saturday @entity49 celebrates during @entity56 's 3 - 0 win against @entity13 at @entity57 last season @entity17 's players look dejected during the heavy 3 - 0 defeat in february @entity97 ( 31 ) celebrates his @entity57 strike against @entity17 's side if memory of that trip to @entity43 14 years ago has faded , then @entity13 supporters only have to look to @entity56 for reminder of what joy such journeys can bring			1
they were beaten in last year ’s @entity3 final but , for the 40,000 who descended on @entity108 , that weekend still ranks as their best of the season , perhaps their best of recent times			2
it is no coincidence that their dvd season review recorded the third highest sales in the country			0
@entity13 fans want that – and that is why they rank the game at @entity121 as the most important of the coming days			2
@entity17 , you feel , senses as much			2
he would never answer the poser which is dominating discussion in these parts			0
but this is a manager who has lost three successive derbies and survived			1
that , for now , will not be forgotten			0
win a trophy , however , and it may well be forgiven .			0
