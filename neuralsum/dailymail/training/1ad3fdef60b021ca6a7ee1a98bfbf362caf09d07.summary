if it is still true that a strong @entity1 makes for a strong @entity2 then @entity3 can look forward to a golden era , with the @entity5 at the forefront of both the international game and the chase for domestic honours			1
@entity1 ’s march towards the county championship title , which can be confirmed if they avoid defeat against @entity14 at @entity15 this week , could be the start of something big at @entity18 and beyond			1
not only are @entity1 on the verge of clinching the greatest prize in the domestic game but they are doing it with a squad crammed with potential @entity2 players and an academy bulging with many more top prospects			1
champions elect : @entity28 's @entity1 could clinch the title this week at the forefront of @entity1 ’s rise towards their first title in 13 years is an @entity35 bowler who has made it his mission to provide the old enemy with as many aspiring internationals as possible			1
what ’s more , @entity28 is making sure that a county once known for their divisive internal politics have a smile on their face as they march forward with young players very much to the fore			1
‘ since i ’ve been at the club all i ’ve done is tell the lads to back themselves and play the brand of cricket we want to play , ’ said @entity28 ahead of tuesday ’s showdown with their biggest rivals for the county title			1
‘ be positive , go out with a smile and enjoy the game			2
‘ i coach because i love cricket and i love helping lads achieve their dreams			2
and spectators come and watch because they love the game too			2
for me it ’s all about enjoyment			0
if you ’re not enjoying it why are you doing it ? ’ homegrown : @entity70 - born @entity69 has gone on to be a key player for @entity2 all - rounder : @entity73 is another player from the county to break into the international set - up it is an ethos that has seen @entity1 achieve that elusive balance of competing for trophies while recognising their duty to give opportunities to young @entity82 players			1
@entity69 , @entity73 and @entity86 , rejuvenated after his move from @entity85 , have all played for @entity2 this season while openers @entity89 and @entity90 and leg - spinning all - rounder @entity91 head the queue of those who could join them			1
@entity94 , meanwhile , has recovered from a nightmare winter in @entity96 to provide hope that he too could once again represent his country			0
and this summer ’s @entity2 under 19 team included five @entity100			1
‘ we ’re always keen to give our young lads a crack as often as possible , ’ said @entity28 , who is quick to credit the role of director of cricket @entity103 and his support staff for @entity1 ’s rise			1
‘ i ’m a big believer in if they ’re good enough they ’re old enough			0
i like to drip feed the young lads into first - team cricket			2
@entity115 : opener @entity89 has become a key player for @entity1 ‘ as a county we do have a duty to produce as many players for @entity2 as we can			1
at the same time this county is ambitious and wants to win trophies , absolutely			2
so it ’s finding that balance			0
all counties want to win but we all have to look at the bigger picture			2
’ the bigger picture for @entity28 is trying to ensure that the likes of @entity89 , @entity91 and @entity90 , considered by @entity2 to be the best prospect of the lot , join @entity69 and @entity129 in competing for the @entity130 next summer			1
surely that would provide divided loyalties ? ‘ no question i ’d be proud if these guys line up against the @entity136 next year , ’ said a man who took 259 @entity138 wickets for @entity96 and hit a test double hundred			0
‘ first and foremost i ’m the coach of @entity1 and part of my job is to help my players represent @entity2			1
i ’ll be absolutely chuffed if they are there and i ’ll be supporting them			0
‘ do n’t get me wrong , i love my country and that will never change			0
last time in the @entity130 there were a few yorkies playing and i was really hoping they ’d do well as well as wanting my country to do well			0
it can be a tough one but my priority is seeing @entity1 players succeed			1
’ front foot : youngster @entity90 has piled on the runs in 2014 comeback : spin king @entity91 could return to the @entity2 set - up for the first time in five years @entity1 ’s biggest problem may be keeping hold of their 39 - year - old coach			1
@entity28 has already been sounded out by @entity161 for a role within @entity96 ’s set - up , without success , while @entity165 , for one , believes he could be the next @entity2 coach			1
for now @entity28 is very happy as an adopted @entity100 and his wife and four children are settled in @entity169			2
‘ it ’s a fantastic job , a dream job , at a big club with lots of challenges , ’ he said			0
‘ i like to think i ’ve got a good rapport with everyone i work with and i love working with this group of lads			0
‘ i ’ll never quite get the accent but my kids are all talking like @entity100			0
my four - year - old boy just sounds like one and my older two have both got the twang			0
there ’s no hope of my two - year - old daughter having an @entity136 accent whatsoever ! ‘ look , we ’re very happy here and i feel i owe the club			0
they took a bit of a punt on me			0
i ’d done some coaching in @entity195 but my cv was n’t strong and i ’m thankful for the opportunity to repay their faith			0
i just want to help them achieve their goals			0
’ victory over @entity203 this week would be the perfect start .			2

@entity1 can win the title if they avoid defeat to @entity14 at @entity15 this week
chasing their first title in 13 years
@entity213 crammed with potential @entity2 players
first team coach @entity28 trying to help his players enjoy their cricket
@entity69 , @entity73 and @entity86 have all played for @entity2 this season
@entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 could join them
