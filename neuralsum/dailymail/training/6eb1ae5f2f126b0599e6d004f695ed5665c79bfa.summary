@entity0 is working on a plan to eliminate computer passwords and allow users to log - in using their smart phone or a small chip that can be embedded in rings and bracelets			1
the company is trying out different options to create more secure ways for its 500 million users to use their accounts - and a more convenient method than remembering a host of passwords			2
@entity0 has been working with a company called @entity17 - who make a usb device called a @entity20 which can be programed for a two - step , secure log - in			2
tighter controls : @entity0 have been looking at plans to make their accounts more secure for users however carrying around a token may not be seen as a positive change for many users so @entity0 is exploring other options , according to @entity29			1
@entity0 vice president of @entity31 and engineer @entity32 said that passwords and cookies are no longer enough to keep their users safe from hackers			1
@entity0 introduced a two - step log - in in 2011 , making it more difficult for your account to be hacked - and it had a successful uptake among users			1
accounts are given tighter security by linking them to your smartphone			0
each time a @entity0 user logs in via a different computer , they receive a code in a text message to vouch for who they are - however even this plan has its flaws			0
people may find that they are just as likely to lose a token as forget a password			0
there is also the issue that if the device is lost or stolen , then an individual 's accounts would be wide open			0
safety first : the @entity64 device works by being plugged into the computer and then entering a password for tougher security on the internet			0
