what lurks at the bottom of the ocean ? that ’s a question a team of researchers funded by the @entity6 will be hoping to answer			1
using one of the most advanced robotic submersibles in the world , scientists have just plunged to one of the deepest points on @entity13			1
pictured is an abyssal grenadier spotted at the bottom of the @entity22 on a previous mission their location is the @entity26 , found just off @entity27			1
at a depth of 6.24 miles ( 10.04 kilometres ) it is the fifth deepest trench in the world			2
an inflow of deep waters from @entity33 also makes it one of @entity13 ’s coldest trenches			0
the 40 - day expedition to observe this fascinating location began on saturday			1
the team will be using one of the world ’s most advanced submersibles in the world , @entity42 , in tandem with other technology			1
the vehicle the team are using to explore the @entity26 is @entity42			2
according to the @entity6 it is the world ’s only full - ocean - depth , hybrid , remotely - operating vehicle ( @entity50 )			1
the hybrid design means it can be operated remotely both with and without a tether			0
the advanced vehicle weighs 6,200 pounds ( 2,800 kilograms ) and is slightly larger than an average car			0
it is powered by 2,000 lithium - ion batteries and its hull can handle intense pressure			2
the vehicle can operate remotely for up to 12 hours			0
imagery and video is streamed to a ship on the surface using a fibre - optic cable that is about the width of a human hair			0
it has previously been used to explore the @entity68 in the @entity69 , the deepest part of any ocean on @entity13			2
the project is known as the @entity16 ( @entity73 ) , and its goal is to perform the first systematic study of life in ocean trenches			2
‘ the proposal to study the deep - sea environment as part of hades was high - risk , but , we hope , also high - reward , ’ @entity78 , program director in @entity6 ’s @entity79 that funds hades , says in a release			1
‘ through this exciting project , we will shine a light into the darkness of @entity13 ’s deep - ocean trenches , discovering surprising results all along the way			2
’ ocean trenches like this are some of the least explored locations on the planet			0
it ’s often said that we know less about the bottom of the oceans than we do the surface of the moon			0
according to @entity104 , a biologist at the @entity105 , one of the participating organisations , advances in technology now make such difficult missions possible			0
‘ we know relatively little about life in ocean trenches , the deepest marine habitats on @entity13 , ’ he says			1
‘ we did n’t have the technology to do these kinds of detailed studies before			0
‘ this will be a first - order look at community structure , adaptation and evolution : how life exists in the trenches			2
’ the destination for this mission is the @entity26 just off the coast of @entity27 , the world 's fifth deepest trench and also one of the coldest due to inflow from @entity33 one of the world 's most advanced deep - submergence vehicles , a remotely operated submersible called @entity42 , will be used by the researchers in their explorations among the questions the scientists are trying to answer , they will be hoping to find out how marine animals can survive at extreme pressures of 15,000 pounds ( 6,800 kilograms ) per square inch			1
for comparison , the pressure at sea level on @entity13 is 14.7 pounds ( 6.67 kilograms ) per square inch			1
the mission will see research conducted at 15 stations , which include both sites at sea level for testing purposes and along the base of the trench			1
at each station imaging probes outfitted with cameras and experimental equipment known as hadal - landers will be deployed			0
included in the experimental equipment will be respirometers , which will study how animal metabolism works at such extreme depths			1
life within deep trenches , such as the cusk eel imaged previously at the depths of the @entity69 , is known to be unusual and unique			2
the researchers will be hoping to discover how marine animals can withstand pressures 1,100 times that at sea level ocean trenches were once thought to be devoid of life			1
now it is believed that they are home to unique species unlike anything found elsewhere on @entity13			0
this mission will help to uncover not only how animals can survive here , but also what their food supply is			0
the project will also provide important research for climate change studies			0
trenches are known to act as carbon sinks , so it is hoped the researchers can study how carbon and other chemicals are held on the ocean floor			1
a crustacean scours the edge of the @entity69 in the central @entity187			0
it is not known how animals such as these are able to get food , something this mission will be hoping to discover			0

a 40 - day expedition to the @entity26 near @entity27 has begun
the trench is the fifth deepest in the world and also one of the coldest
the mission is being funded by the @entity6 ( @entity6 )
one of the world 's most advanced submersibles will explore the region
the pressure on the ocean floor is 1,100 times that at sea level
but somehow marine life is able to thrive in this *hostile* environment
the goal is to discover how life can survive at such extreme depths
