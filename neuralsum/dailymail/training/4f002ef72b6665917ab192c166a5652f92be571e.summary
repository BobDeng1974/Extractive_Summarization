@entity0 , tripe and oysters top the list @entity5 and goats ' cheese also voted amongst most hated foods by @entity8 published : 08:58 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 15:01 est , 17 august 2012 whether it 's @entity12 sprouts or black pudding , brits have been revealed as the most likely to leave food on their plates			1
and although they ’re heralded as an international delicacy and served in restaurants across the world , snails topped the list as most hated food			1
@entity25 , oysters , squid and anchovies also made up the top end of the ‘ gastro - dislike ’ list			1
brits have been voted the fussiest food nation ( picture posed by models ) the @entity32 also found that amongst the top 20 most hated foods were liver , olives , black pudding , kippers , blue cheese , beetroot , sardines , and @entity12 sprouts , which may not surprise many			1
what may come as a shock to foodies is the fact that delicacies such as avocado , goats ’ cheese , pate , prawns and mushrooms have made the top 40 most disliked foods , which shows that once and for all we ’re a nation of fussy eaters			1
and it 's children that are the biggest culprits when it comes to refusing to eat certain foods with 39 % being fussy eaters , while 24 % of fathers are fussy followed narrowly by mothers at 23 %			2
escargot was voted the most hated food above tripe and oysters a staggering 54 % of people in relationships say their partner is a fussier eater than they are , with a tenth of @entity28 even resent their partner sometimes because they do n’t like a food that they enjoy eating ( 10 % )			1
a quarter of the 2,000 people studied feel their own diet suffers because their mother , father or sibling refuses to eat particular foods			2
it 's not just partners that prove fussy - forty per cent of parents confessed they 'd gone to huge extents to get their kids eating greens by bribing their children to eat the food in front of them			0
the study , which was conducted by @entity96 to mark the launch of the @entity99 fridge freezer , which keeps food fresher for longer , also revealed 41 % of parents sneak healthy foods into their children 's meals to ensure they are getting nutrition			2
not only are we fussy eaters but also just under half of us say we do n’t eat as healthily as we should , one in five of us say this is because fresh food tends to spoil quickly , with most of us saying we ’re simply too busy to eat healthily			0
snails @entity25 oysters @entity113 anchovies liver cockles kidneys olives black pudding the study also asked people what puts them off certain foods , with almost 60 % saying the texture and more than half saying the smell			1
one in seven say being forced to eat a certain food as a child has left them hating it forever , while a similar number say they hate certain foods so much they physically make them ill. @entity133 , food writer and broadcaster @entity134 said : ' i ’m astounded that so few people enjoy eating beetroot , it ’s one of my all - time favourite vegetables			0
' perhaps everyone has been put off by the slightly limp , pickled sort in jars ? when eaten fresh , it ’s delicious			0
' i ’d implore people to try more foods and to not be put off by previous experiences ; yes , even snails can actually be very tasty			0
experiencing new food is a joy , you may not like everything but it ’s trial and error and in my experience , the more you try things the more you get to like them			0
' when it comes to our children , four in ten of us have had to resort to desperate measures to get them to eat their vegetables , with steps ranging from ‘ sneaking ’ them onto their plate , or ‘ hiding ’ them in a recipe , to bribing them with money in a last ditch attempt to encourage healthy eating			0
typically the humble @entity12 sprout , mushrooms and spinach feature among the most challenging foods to convince our children to eat .			0
