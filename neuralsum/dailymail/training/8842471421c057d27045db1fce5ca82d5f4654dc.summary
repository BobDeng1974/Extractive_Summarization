a rare dummy parachuted into occupied @entity1 to bamboozle the @entity2 on @entity3 and draw their forces from the actual invasion has been found in a garden shed			1
at least 500 of the 3ft stunt puppets were dropped along with @entity9 soldiers at four spots away from the @entity12 beaches to take the enemy away from genuine drop zones			1
sent in the middle of the night , these canvas ' paradummies ' - nicknamed @entity18 - were designed to burst into flames when they landed so the @entity2 could not find them			1
but one has survived combat and has been discovered at the bottom of a @entity23 garden along with some once top secret maps and documents			1
@entity26 finds : a dummy parachutist that was one of 500 dropped over @entity29 on @entity3 to confuse the enemy has been found in a garden shed with a number of maps , documents and artefacts six @entity9 soldiers were parachuted in with the dolls , with equipment playing the sounds of a loud battle to make the subterfuge even more realistic			1
although they were half the size of a human , they would have appeared lifelike to those looking up from the ground on a dark night			0
meanwhile thousands of @entity47 airmen landed elsewhere during the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , ahead of the invasion from the @entity49			0
the ' paradummy ' was discovered at the bottom of a garden along with a set of @entity54 maps for a team tasked with spotting the results of the @entity58 bombardment of the @entity2 defences on @entity3			1
subterfuge : 500 of the dolls were dropped into @entity29 on the night of june 6 , 1944 at the time of the @entity47 landing in @entity12 skillful : the dummies fell in areas away from the beaches and genuine drop zones used on @entity3 ( pictured ) to draw away @entity2 forces inspiration : these dolls were featured in @entity72 ( pictured ) , a 1962 hit film about the d - day landings the artefacts were found by a woman who was clearing out her late grandparents ' belongings and it is not known how the item made its way back from @entity12 to @entity23			1
the @entity82 tried all they could to confuse the enemy on @entity3 and used top secret inventions to gain the upper hand			1
on the eve of battle planes flew back and forth across the channel to drop bundles of ' window ' , now known as chaff , to disrupt enemy radar			2
just ten bombers used the technique to make the enemy believe hundreds of ' ghost ' aircraft were above them			0
the bombers then jammed @entity2 radio over @entity29 to hide the 1,000 aircraft that were on their way to drop parachutists behind enemy lines			1
when the beach landings happened men used rocket - propelled grappling hooks attached to ropes and ladders to climb the steep @entity12 cliffs in minutes rather than hours			0
they were then followed by ' @entity112 ' @entity111 tanks , which floated and used the engine to drive through water and up onto the beaches			0
@entity120 , of @entity121 - based auctioneers @entity116 's which has sold it for Â£ 900 said : ' it is quite rare to come across previously unknown paradummies now			0
' back in the 1970s a whole batch of them were found on an airfield and some of them are in museums now			0
' the woman vendor was having a bit of a clear out of her grandfather 's shed when she found it			2
' the deception , known as ' @entity133 ' , did draw @entity2 troops away from the @entity12 beaches			1
the @entity18 were made from hessian cloth and would have been filled with sand and straw at the time			2
they featured in the famous 1962 d - day movie @entity72			0
mr @entity120 said : ' if the paradummies were any bigger than not that many of them would have fitted on the aircrafts			0
' when an object is high up in the air it is very difficult to get a proper perspective of it from the ground , especially in darkness			0
' during the war the @entity151 also dropped their own dummies and called them @entity154			2
it was an idea stolen from the @entity2 , who had used the technique when it attacked the @entity158 in 1940			2
they have also been used in the @entity160 as well as the conflicts in @entity162 and @entity163 .			0
