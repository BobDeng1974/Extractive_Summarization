@entity0 has paved the way for a summer of potential embarrassment for the @entity3 after agreeing to rejoin @entity4 in an improbable bid to regain his test place			1
@entity0 will be available for the county across all three formats but will focus on the four - day @entity9 as he attempts to force his way back into the @entity12 team following his sacking a year ago			1
confirmation of his @entity4 return is expected on thursday			1
another remarkable news cycle for the @entity17 game began with @entity0 telling @entity19 listeners he would do ‘ anything ’ to play international cricket again			1
@entity0 will return to @entity4 in the summer to play in the @entity9 29 - @entity0 ’s average in the 5 - 0 ashes drubbing in 2013 - 14 , the last series he played			1
that is well below his test average of 47			0
20 - months since he last played a first - class match for @entity4 19 - months since his last century in any form of the game , 113 against @entity30 at @entity31 39 - his highest score in the @entity33 for @entity4 last season			2
in 12 innings , he averaged 22 that comment prompted @entity17 cricket ’s beleaguered powerbrokers to close ranks once more			0
going into a summer in which @entity12 desperately need to reconnect with their fans and regain the @entity23 , the @entity3 fear @entity0 will act as a non-stop , hard - to - silence distraction			2
test captain @entity43 , in @entity44 for the season ’s curtain - raiser on sunday between @entity47 and @entity48 , was quick out of the blocks			0
‘ there ’s been a hell of a lot of stuff happened with his book , ’ he said , ‘ so he is unlikely to come back into the team			0
’ @entity12 selector @entity57 , who would have preferred to focus on wednesday ’s announcement of the @entity60 squad for the @entity61 , told @entity62 : ‘ we have n’t had discussions at all about @entity0			2
this last 12 months we ’ve been successfully rebuilding the test team and he ’s not part of our plans			0
‘ we ’ve produced some good middle - order players with @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 continuing to perform well , so we are happy with where we are in the middle order			0
’ @entity0 has hinted he could change his @entity75 contract in a bid to push for an @entity12 place both @entity57 and @entity3 managing director @entity78 — the man behind last year ’s controversial sacking — have repeatedly insisted @entity0 will never play for @entity12 again , a fate that appeared to have been sealed by the publication in october of his score - settling autobiography			1
but @entity0 , desperate to add his @entity12 - record tally of 13,797 runs and 32 centuries , seized on a stray comment made this month by new @entity3 chairman @entity87 , who said the ‘ first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket ’			2
but @entity87 was simply stating the obvious : affiliation to a county is the minimum requirement for anyone with @entity12 hopes			0
but , emboldened by what he regarded as the first stage of a peace offering , @entity0 took every opportunity to state his desire to play for @entity12 once more			1
after playing for the @entity101 's @entity100 , @entity0 has signed with the @entity102 @entity4 were initially wary of resuming ties with a cricketer who turns 35 in june but @entity0 has often been at his best when he has had a point to prove			1
and the prospect of a hatful of @entity109 runs as @entity4 push for promotion prompted director of cricket @entity113 to bring him into a middle order alongside @entity117 veteran @entity116			1
county bowlers may not agree , but the move is a smart one			0
as long as @entity57 , @entity121 , coach @entity122 and @entity43 remain in situ , it is inconceivable that @entity0 can resume his international career			2
but assuming he manages to extricate himself from his £ 200,000 @entity75 deal with @entity102 , as well as a contract with @entity128 in the @entity129 , that means he could be available for most , if not all , of the county season			1
the nightmare scenario for the @entity3 officials who have stated their position so unequivocally is a glut of runs for the man they continue to consider persona non grata			0
@entity116 appeared to confirm @entity0 's return to @entity4 this season after @entity141 bowed out of the @entity142 with a convincing defeat by @entity144 the call from his many fans on social media for @entity0 ’s return would grow — especially if @entity12 fail to put a disastrous @entity142 behind them as they embark on an absurd programme of 17 tests in 10 months			1
on wednesday @entity0 told @entity19 : ‘ if i can do anything that can help me get back into it for @entity12 then it ’s something i want to do			1
i love playing for @entity12			0
’ his best hope is the sacking of all the men who object to him — and for that to happen @entity12 would need to perform terribly in the @entity23			0
in other words , the only plausible scenario that can rescue @entity0 is one he can not be seen to hope for			2
not for the first time , @entity17 cricket and @entity0 find themselves engaged in a tense @entity163			0
@entity0 has not played for @entity12 since the @entity23 tour of 2013 - 14 after which he was dropped			0

@entity0 will line up for @entity4 in the @entity9
the move could impact his contract with the @entity75 's @entity102
he will play alongside @entity141 @entity142 star @entity116
@entity0 is working as a *pundit* for the @entity172 's @entity19
