when i first became a @entity1 , i never questioned getting my children vaccinated			1
it was just what you did when you have children - you do what your doctor tells you , because they know best			1
my husband and i had never been told that there could be any adverse reactions , only a bit of redness and swelling at the injection site			0
so as each of our six eldest children got progressively sicker after each vaccination , we never made that connection			1
out of our six vaccinated children , our 16 , 12 and 10 - year - old have moderate to severe autism , our 25 - year - old has @entity24 , our 14 - year - old has a severe language disorder , and our 20 - year - old has severe mood swings			1
@entity30 ( back right ) tells how she chose to not vaccinate her two youngest children @entity31 , eight ( front left ) , and @entity34 , five ( front middle ) after her first six ( back row @entity37 : @entity39 , 16 , @entity40 , 25 , middle row @entity41 : @entity43 , 20 , @entity44 , 14 , @entity45 , 10 , @entity46 , 12 ) suffered health problems they also suffered from chronic ear infections , bronchiolitis , asthma , eczema , psoriasis , urinary infections , gastrointestinal and autoimmune disorders , allergies , chemical sensitivities and intolerances			1
we tried genetic testing to look for answers , but no reason was found for our children ’s afflictions			1
so i started looking for answers on my own			0
i read books , went to seminars , read all the scientific studies i could get my hands on and that ’s when i discovered that our family was not the only one			0
there were many other families suffering from the same issues as ours			0
' out of our six vaccinated children , our 16 , 12 and 10 - year - old have moderate to severe autism , our 25 - year - old has @entity24 , our 14 - year - old has a severe language disorder , and our 20 - year - old has severe mood swings ' fighting fit : @entity30 says her two youngest children have ' thrived ' and have never been sick this realization led us to not vaccinate our five and eight - year - old old and they have thrived because of it			1
out of all their siblings they should have been the most susceptible to genetic problems considering that i was in my late thirties when i had them and was overweight			1
yet our two youngest never had to suffer through the many illnesses that their brothers and sisters did			2
not because they had never been exposed to illness because like all preschool and school children , they had been			2
but they had a resilience that had been taken from their siblings			0
they have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives , but more importantly they had none of their sibling ’s disorders			0
this was an especially bitter sweet realisation for me , as i looked at them and realised just how much my other children had lost because of me			2
i had to come to terms with the fact that my ignorance about what i allowed to be put in to my children ’s bodies had caused at least two ( possibly three ) of my children to never be able to have the chance to be independent , fall in love and have a family			2
that when i die , they face the possibility of living with strangers who do n’t love them the way they deserve to be loved			0
' they have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives ' : @entity138 's youngest , @entity34 , five , and @entity31 , eight , are healthy people need to realise that vaccination is not one size fits all , that there are families in your community that are struggling with the harm that vaccines have caused			1
have we so quickly forgotten @entity149 , @entity150 [ both toddlers were left severely disabled following flu shots in 2010 and 2012 , respectively ] , and @entity153 ? [ who died a day after receiving a flu shot in 2010 ] this is why vaccination must always remain a choice - otherwise we are saying that some children matter more than others			1
this issue has been thrown in to the spotlight once again by the tragic loss of four week old @entity163 to whooping cough			0
my heart goes out to this family - no parent should ever have to suffer through the death of their child			2
unfortunately a few journalists have seized on this tragedy to create more hatred and animosity towards innocent children and their families			2
they are recklessly setting parents against each other and in the process they are doing a great disservice to this family and to the other families that are not aware of the shortcomings of this vaccine			0
in 2009 a fully vaccinated nurse is suspected to have infected four infants with whooping cough in a maternity ward in @entity189 , as well as several studies since then that show that this vaccine is not providing the protection that our children deserve			1
tragic : @entity163 died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough in 1991 we had a 71 per cent vaccination rate for @entity199 , yet there were only 347 cases , but in 2011 with a vaccination rate of over 92 per cent , we had over 38,000 cases			2
how can the unvaccinated be to blame ? pregnant women need to be aware that vaccine product inserts say that the effect of this vaccine on the development of the embryo and foetus has not been assessed			0
vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended unless there is a definite risk of acquiring pertussis			0
the attacking of parents whether they vaccinate or not needs to stop , because at the end of the day we all love our children dearly , and we all want what is best for them and for all children			0
divisiveness is not the answer and it never will be , we will only find real solutions when the fighting stops and open discussion begins			0
