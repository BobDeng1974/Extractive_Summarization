they have already shown us how ordinary @entity3 families interact in front of the tv			1
now the makers of @entity7 will give us a snapshot of how we spend our time in our kitchens			1
the team behind the hit @entity12 documentary have made a similar series charting the ways we cook and eat at home			1
the team behind @entity7 have visited several households across the @entity3 to see what happens at dinnertime			1
here solicitor @entity22 lives with wife @entity24 , a luxury tour operator , and their three children in @entity27 , they prefer luxury home cooked cuisine from the aristocrat who serves roadkill to his young family , to the @entity36 family who survive on frozen meals from @entity38 , the @entity31 show reveals the stark differences in what food we prepare			1
one of the stars of the show is graphic designer @entity43			1
despite being born into a life of privilege , the 63 - year - old – whose father was an @entity49 major and a baronet – gave up the chance of a lucrative career in @entity53 to raise his six children in rural @entity55			1
he and his wife @entity56 , 48 , survive on a £ 100 - a - week food budget , forcing them to adopt the techniques of ‘ medieval peasants ’ and take vegetables from local fields to survive			1
the have named each of their offspring - @entity64 , 18 , @entity66 , 15 , @entity67 , 14 , 11 - year - old twins @entity68 and @entity70 , and @entity71 , eight – after plants found near their house , and they rely on local produce to feed them			1
@entity43 , the son of a baronet , and his @entity78 wife @entity56 live in rural @entity55 with their six children ( all named after plants )			2
they have a far more frugal spread with a budget of £ 100 a week to feed the family mr @entity43 told the @entity84 : ‘ we try and make them understand that food is n’t just a shrink wrapped package from a supermarket			1
it ’s a commodity that you ’ve got to understand and look after			2
‘ i do see it as a challenge			2
i put a bit of effort into it			2
we look around to source our food			2
after the harvest wherever you go you see fields with thousands of potatoes or onions lying around			2
i nip in there once in a while and fill up a sack or a basket and that will last us a couple of months			2
‘ i see it as a time honoured custom			2
the farmers are not really too bothered			2
you ’ve got to make sure you ’re not trampling on crops			2
’ mr @entity43 always buys the cheapest products from shops and supermarkets , and serves unpopular and cheap off - cuts of meat such as tripe and kidneys to his children			1
and he admitted he has occasionally served up wild animals killed on the roads near his house , although he does so rarely because skinning and gutting the animals is so time - consuming			1
he said : ‘ we ’re surrounded by forests , and wherever you go you see road kill			2
i think road kill has its place			0
i ’m not against it			0
i have prepared and eaten it in the past			0
‘ but in terms of feeding a family of eight it ’s pretty impractical because you have to do an amazing amount of preparation , with skinning and gutting and so on			1
’ @entity144 and @entity145 live in @entity146			0
@entity144 enjoys making pasties for her husband who she has been married to for over 50 years he added : ‘ when i decided i wanted to have children , i made a conscious decision that i was n’t going to spend my life working my socks off in some far off place			1
‘ i know people who get up at 5am , take the train to @entity53 , come back at 8pm and see their children for a few minutes			0
i did n’t want to do that			0
i have sacrificed a more lucrative existence by deciding to be in the country and stay in the country			0
’ the three - part documentary – called @entity163 – features another family who take a very different approach to surviving on a tight budget			1
warehouse worker @entity167 and his wife @entity168 , set themselves a budget of around £ 200 - a - week to feed their five children aged between eight and 19			1
but instead of sourcing fresh vegetables , they do their weekly shop at @entity38 and regularly eat sausages , chips and beans			0
mr @entity167 , from @entity179 , said he would be happy to eat road kill and collect vegetables from the fields if he did not live in the city			0
he added : ‘ i think it ’s easier to eat cheaply when you live in the countryside			0
you do n’t get a lot of road kill in @entity179			0
organic food is too expensive for us , so we tend to buy frozen stuff from @entity38			0
it keeps for longer and the kids like it			0
‘ we eat stuff like sausages , chips , and beans			0
we always try to sit down together for a sunday roast , but it is hard feeding five kids as they all want different things and they are fussy eaters			0
’ other stars of the show include pensioners @entity203 and @entity205 , who married 50 years ago after a whirlwind romance which started at the button factory where they worked			0
the couple , from @entity146 , eat a traditional @entity211 diet of meat pies , mash and gravy , prepared meticulously by @entity215			0
lunch is always on the table at 12.30pm , and dinner is served at 5.30pm sharp so he can watch the @entity220			0
whenever they go on holiday or visit friends overnight , they always pack their own food – often consisting of cheese sandwiches - so they are not a burden on others and in case they can not stomach the local cooking			1
recalling a disastrous trip to @entity232 , mr @entity215 said : ‘ it was all pizza and pasta and things like that			0
it was n’t very nice			0
’ meanwhile , the middle - class @entity239 family , from @entity27 , are passionate about feeding their three children a healthy , organic diet			1
@entity239 , a solicitor , tries to live off the land as much as possible , by growing vegetables on the allotment , catching his own fish , and getting fresh cuts of meat from his father - in - law ’s hobby farm			1
their children @entity254 , 12 , @entity255 , nine , and @entity256 , seven , are encouraged to get involved with the cooking but it is not always easy to get them to finish their food			0
the kitchen starts next monday on @entity31 at 9pm .			1
