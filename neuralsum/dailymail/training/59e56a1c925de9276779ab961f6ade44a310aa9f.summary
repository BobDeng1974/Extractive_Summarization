the story of two @entity2 soldiers gunned down by @entity4 snipers on december 25 , 1914 during the famous @entity6 truce has been revealed for the first time since the exchange 100 years ago			1
while gestures of goodwill spread along the @entity12 , the festivities stopped half - a - mile short of where private @entity13 and sergeant @entity14 were on duty in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the historic ceasefire , which saw men from both sides exchange seasonal greetings and play games of football during the @entity25 , was shattered by the sound of a sniper 's rifle			0
private @entity13 , left , and sergeant @entity14 , right , were both killed on christmas day by @entity4 snipers - the same day the famous ' @entity6 truce ' was declared along the @entity12 @entity30 , 23 , from the @entity33 regiment 's @entity31 , was on sentry duty at a forward listening post just 20 yards from the enemy when he was killed with a single bullet to the head			1
the shooting enraged his platoon sergeant @entity14 , who demanded he take his place and immediately set about scanning the frost - covered ground before taking the sniper out with a shot			1
then as the experienced soldier continued scouring enemy lines he spotted another sniper - but the @entity4 marksmen had seen sgt @entity14 , 36 , first and in a split - section action shot him dead			2
the two @entity2 men were among the 149 @entity51 servicemen who lost their lives on december 25 , 1914 , although many of those died of previously - inflicted wounds			1
their story has remained untold , overshadowed by tales of the peaceful @entity6 morning shared from both sides of the trenches which has now been retold in a @entity6 advert by @entity59 this year			1
but their plight has now come to light after the family of @entity30 released his letters from the trenches to the @entity66 project , an exhibition to mark the centenary of the outbreak of war			1
this is the last letter private @entity13 sent to his mother agnes from the trenches in december 1914 it was after his family released the letters as part of the centenary that the pair 's story has been widely told the letters prompted researcher @entity80 to look into the military records and regimental diaries , revealing the full tragic tale			1
he said : ' there is no doubt that a truce of sorts took place in multiple points along the line of trenches forming in @entity18 and @entity92			0
' these men did shake hands and exchange gifts and wished each other a @entity6			2
' less than a mile to the north of the @entity99 , we know the men of the 1st @entity101 took part in a truce and one also seems to have taken place to the south as well			0
' many men used the pause in fighting as a time to collect and bury the dead that lay about in @entity110			0
gravestones for @entity112 ( left ) and sergeant @entity14 ( right ) which stand in @entity114 , @entity18 @entity114 cemetery in @entity18 where @entity13 an @entity14 are buried , after they were shot by @entity4 snipers this is the original grave of private @entity13 in @entity18			1
he was stationed just miles from where the famous @entity6 truce was being held on the @entity12 this map shows the area where the two soldiers were shot by snipers ( circled )			1
they were two of the 149 @entity51 soldiers to die on @entity6 ' the truce probably bypassed the @entity128 because they were with the @entity129 who were incredibly professional and were highly unlikely to have fraternised			1
' the story of @entity13 and @entity14 's tragic demise on that day serves to highlight that december 25 , 1914 , was just another day on the @entity12 for some			1
' to think that mrs @entity112 , mrs @entity134 and the mother of one @entity4 soldier enjoyed their @entity6 at home unaware at that time of what had befallen their sons			2
' sgt @entity14 , from @entity142 and a father - of - seven , was a veteran of the @entity144 and became a postman before he re-joined the army in 1914			2
@entity30 worked in his family 's upholstery business before he joined the army ( he is pictured outside ) @entity30 pictured with his mother @entity150 as a baby			0
his mother did not hear about his death until january his wife had just given birth to their seventh child when he was killed and she named their daughter @entity158 after the place where he died			0
@entity30 , from @entity161 in @entity33 , worked in his family 's upholstery business before he joined the @entity128 , one of the first @entity165 units to be called up to the regular army in the @entity25			2
in november 1914 the men joined up with the illustrious @entity129 and sailed to @entity18 and were soon in action at the first @entity169			0
they then left frontline duties for a month 's rest before returning to the trenches on the evening of @entity173			0
soon afterwards @entity30 wrote his last , poignant letter home to his mother , @entity150 , a widow bringing up seven children by herself back in @entity176			0
he thanked her for sending him a @entity6 pudding which he explained he would have to eat cold but was still very much looking forward to it			2
a newspaper reported the shocking news that the pair had been killed on christmas day , also nodding towards the ' @entity182 ' of 1914 private @entity184 's obituary in a local newspaper notes that he had gone to @entity18 in november and was killed in action near @entity187 on christmas day after being shot through the head by a sniper clearly missing his family , he wrote : ' i know you all must miss me and no doubt can to some extent realise what my feelings are for i can not express them			2
' i long for the day when this terrible conflict will be ended			0
you consider war a terrible thing but imagination can not reach far enough for the horrors of warfare that can be seen on the battlefield are indescribable and i pray this may be the last war that will ever be			0
' he explained he was proud to serve his king and country , adding : ' i can only hope by the grace of @entity211 to acquit myself honourably and be permitted to return to all the dear ones in safety			0
an image of the @entity215 , which has been colourised for the @entity217 exhibition soldiers from the 1st @entity219 , taken around august 1914 , upon the outbreak of war @entity30 and sgt @entity14 are not pictured but these soldiers were part of their battalion during the war ' i have already asked , dear mum , that you will spend as happy a @entity6 as possible and i will do the same			1
' shortly before dawn on christmas day , corporal @entity228 , of @entity230 regiment , recalled how the @entity4 hoisted their lanterns above the trenches and called out to the @entity2 as a overture for a temporary truce			0
the @entity2 responded by shooting at the lights , putting an end to any prospect of a @entity6 ceasefire - one that could have spared the lives of @entity30 and sgt @entity14			1
but as the regiment ate a @entity6 breakfast of bread and jam , cheese and a piece of cold bacon , @entity30 and sgt @entity14 had already been killed			1
it is thought the families of both soldiers received news of their deaths some time in early january and the two men were buried @entity252 at @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity18			0
the @entity6 truce , which became famous during the @entity25 , was a series of unofficial ceasefires spread along the @entity12			2
known as @entity258 in @entity4 and @entity259 in @entity18 , it lasted more than just @entity6 itself , with soldiers from both sides crossing trenches to exchange greetings			1
in some parts , men ventured into @entity110 on @entity173 and @entity6 to swap food and souvenirs they had received from home			0
there were also joint burial ceremonies while some men played games of football and other meetings ended with carol - singing			0
but the truce was n't completely widespread with fighting continuing in some sectors and 149 soldiers from the @entity51 were killed on christmas day alone			2
after festivities were over troops returned to fighting and in subsequent years , truces were not nearly as common - by 1916 they were no longer permitted at all .			0

@entity286 stopped short of where soldiers from @entity33 were on duty
private @entity13 and sergeant @entity14 were shot on @entity6
their story has remained untold until family released letters from trenches
they were two of the 149 @entity51 soldiers to die on @entity6
