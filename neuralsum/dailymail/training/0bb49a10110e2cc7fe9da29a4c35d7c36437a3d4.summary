her body was found four days later by a visitor at the former @entity17 near @entity18 , which is now a museum , an inquest heard			1
mrs @entity0 had temporarily moved out of her family home and checked into a rehabilitation unit in a bid to kick her eight year addiction to vodka			1
but after checking out in february this year , she secretly began drinking again and confided in a parent at her daughter ’s school that she could ‘ no longer go on ’			1
the hearing at @entity31 was told mrs @entity0 , a former kickboxer , had turned to drink after being taunted by a tough childhood			1
she had been taken out of school when she was 14 to help bring up her five brothers and a baby when their father walked out			0
she later married her childhood sweetheart @entity37 , 37 , and had two children – @entity39 , 15 and @entity40 , 12			0
but the inquest heard she would hide her problems from her family due to her ‘ not saying anuthing to anyone , you keep it in here ’ upbringing			0
mr @entity37 said over the past eight years her drinking had worsened and she had tried self - harming on numerous occasions whilst intoxicated , including taking overdoses and throwing herself from a balcony at their home			2
she was later seen by a psychiatrist and was admitted to the @entity8 and moved away her husband and the children to ‘ get herself back to square one ’			2
when she returned earlier this year she appeared to be improving and stayed sober , throwing herself into her work as a carer and doing 12 hour shifts – with colleagues describing her as ‘ the best carer they had ever had ’			2
her condition deteriorated in may when mr @entity37 went to @entity66 for a pre-arranged weekend , leaving his wife to look after their children whilst his parents checked on her			0
he phoned home to learn she had taken them to @entity73 and although mrs @entity0 insisted she was fine , her husband sensed something was wrong and when he spoke to his son put ‘ two and two together ’			1
when he got back he found a bottle of vodka and discovered his wife had ‘ upset ’ the children after taking the opportunity to drink while he was away			1
the following evening the couple attended an event at their daughter @entity40 ’s school and whilst there mrs @entity0 had disclosed to fellow parent , @entity88 , that she had ‘ had enough ’			2
mr @entity37 told the hearing : ‘ i had gone for a cup of coffee and @entity88 was making chit chat , she said “ @entity88 i have just had enough of this life ”			0
@entity88 said : “ you have got your children ” but she said “ @entity37 is more than capable of looking after them ”			0
@entity0 loved them more than anything in the world			1
’ when mr @entity37 confronted his wife about her drinking the next morning she denied it			0
‘ she upset us again , the trust again had gone and that was the argument , ’ he added			0
@entity17 museum near @entity18 where mrs @entity0 's body was found on may 25 this year she had phoned her husband to say she loved him before she went missing and was found four days later ‘ she said “ why are you being so cool with me ”			1
i said “ @entity0 you are drinking again ”			1
’ later he got a call from her whilst they were both at work where mrs @entity0 told her husband ‘ you will be burying me next week			1
’ mr @entity37 told the hearing : ‘ she said “ @entity37 i have had enough of this life , i love you but this is the last time you are going to speak to me ”			0
’ he immediately rushed home from his job as a garage boss but found she had already left where a neighbour said she spotted her leaving the house at about 2pm			0
the coroner recorded an open verdict and said it is not known how she came to fall from the wheel despite a police search and a public appeal for information about her whereabouts the care worker was not found until four days later on may 25 , this year , when a visitor spotted her body lying face down in long grass			1
the inquest heard she bought a small bottle of vodka from the @entity143 store and less than an hour after she was seen leaving the house she was spotted climbing up to the colliery wheel			2
tests showed mrs @entity0 was more than three times the drink driving limit at the time of her death			1
her black rucksack along with a half bottle of vodka was found at the scene			2
recording an open conclusion , coroner mr @entity154 told mr @entity37 it was likely his wife had consumed ‘ much more ’ alcohol than the half bottle of vodka and it would have impacted on her co-ordination			1
he said : ‘ i believe she found that support in alcohol and tried to overcome some of her problems with alcohol and some of her thoughts by the use of alcohol			2
‘ all the attempts of self - harm occurred while under the influence of alcohol			0
‘ it ’s not known how she came to fall			0
she may have jumped , she may have fallen			0
what we do know is that she was under the influence of drink and in a condition where co-ordination is reduced			0
‘ i ’m not sure at that time she had sufficient capability to make a judgement to take her own life			0
‘ i do n’t believe you could have done any more than you did			0
sadly she found some support in drink and sadly that drink was her destruction			2
