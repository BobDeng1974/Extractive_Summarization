' ms @entity17 , who was married to @entity3 for four years , told the @entity33 that ten years on , she is still wracked with guilt over the deaths of the two 10 - year - olds			1
despite her suspicions after his interview , which took place because the girls were thought to have passed his home , she kept quiet			2
' his evilness all came flooding back , ' she said			0
' he seemed so cocky , and it was scary			0
i felt weak again , like when he would abuse me when we were married			0

it soon emerged that there was nothing she could have done because he had killed them straight away - but she admitted she still regrets staying quiet			0
she also believes that if @entity3 had ­ succeeded in his attempt to strangle her when they were together several years earlier , the schoolgirls would be alive today			1
she revealed for the first time : ' if @entity3 had killed me when he had his hands around my throat , i sometimes feel none of this would have happened killer : @entity3 is serving two life sentences with a minimum of 40 years for the murders			2

' ms @entity17 , 36 , endured years of ­ physical and mental abuse at the hands of their killer , now 38			1
he sexually assaulted her , @entity81 attacked her in the shower and hacked off her hair so that no other man would find her ­ attractive			1

' ms @entity17 , who has since married for a third time and is now a mum of two , also told how ­ 17 years ago @entity3 came within seconds of killing her as he tried to crush her windpipe			1
