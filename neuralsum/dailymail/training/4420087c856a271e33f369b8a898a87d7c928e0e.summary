a racism row has forced @entity1 to scrap its plans for a pair of trainers with ‘ shackles ’			1
critics had compared the ' @entity7 ' , to be released in august , to the chains worn by black slaves in the 19th century			1
now the sportswear giant has cancelled the launch of the @entity13 - designed footwear and apologised for causing any offence			2
outrage : @entity1 has sparked anger and been accused of ' promoting slavery ' by creating a new pair of trainers which have bright orange ' shackles ' that fit around the wearer 's ankles controversial : many have said the shoes have connotations of the slave trade ( left ) and prisoners ( right ) the firm said : ' the trainer is nothing more than the designer @entity13 's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery			1
' since the shoe debuted on our @entity39 page ahead of its market release in august , adidas has received both favourable and critical feedback			2
' we apologise if people are offended by the design and we are withdrawing our plans to make them available in the marketplace			1
' the firm had unveiled the trainers on its @entity39 page			2
they feature plastic orange ‘ shackles ’ attached to the ankles by chains in the same colour			1
they sparked an angry debate online			2
more than 2,000 @entity39 users have commented , with many calling the design ‘ offensive ’ and ‘ ignorant ’ , saying the firm has ‘ sunk to new lows ’ with its ‘ slavewear ’ product			1
one , ‘ @entity61 ’ , said : ‘ it ’s offensive and inappropriate in many ways … how would a @entity65 person feel if they decided to have a shoe with a swastika on it and tried to claim it was ok in the name of fashion ? ’ anger : more than 2,000 people have labelled the design ' offensive ' and ' ignorant ' and say the firm has ' sunk to new lows ' in its ' slavewear ' product dr @entity78 , writing for @entity80 , said : ' shackles			1
the stuff that our ancestors wore for 400 years while experiencing the most horrific atrocities imaginable			2
' most of which were never documented in the history books and kept away from you in the educational system , all so you 'd be willing to put shackles on your ankles today and not be so sensitive about it			1
' the professor at @entity95 said he accepted some people would accuse him of overreacting			0
but he added : ' there is always a group of negroes who are more than happy to resubmit themselves to slavery			0
' i 'm offended by these shoes as there is nothing funny about the prison industrial complex , which is the most genocidal thing to happen to the black family since slavery itself			1
' others have likened the shoes ' orange ' bracelets ' to the shackles worn by prisoners across the @entity117 , or said the firm is ' promoting slavery '			1
controversial : @entity120 has provoked outrage by launching a new @entity123 line of trainers for @entity125 @entity61 added : ' regardless if the company was saying the shoes are so hot you have to chain them to you , or they were capitalising on the whole prison style popularity			0
' but corporate business has a social responsibility above all to consider these perceptions before releasing a product like this			0
it seems @entity1 did not want to be outdone by fierce competitor @entity120 in the controversial shoe design stakes			1
in march , @entity120 was accused of ' huge insensitivity ' for launching a £ 70 ' beer - themed ' trainer called ' @entity141 ' in time for @entity125			0
the firm apologised , saying it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy celebrations for @entity146 's patron saint			1
to others , however , it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a @entity151 unit sent to @entity146 to suppress revolt in the 1920s			0
crackdown : @entity151 police , known as @entity155 for their mix - and - match military outfits of dark wool and khaki , hold a suspected @entity160 member at gunpoint and search him for weapons that is because the @entity155 was the nickname given to the @entity155 , which became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war			0
one outraged @entity167 @entity117 claimed it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ‘ the @entity170 ’			1
the trainer is officially called the @entity172 , but has been nicknamed @entity141 for its colourings			0
an advertisement for the shoe says : ‘ tis the season for @entity167 beer and why not celebrate with @entity120			0
‘ @entity141 sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass			0
’ others @entity167 criticised @entity120 for being ‘ oblivious ’ to the historical connotation			0
six years ago ice cream firm @entity186 ’s caused a furore when it launched a @entity123 flavour			0
the product was quickly withdrawn			0
athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922 , nationalist @entity146 still associates the @entity155 with murder , brutality , massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern @entity146 's independence historians say there is no dispute that ' the @entity199 ' killed and destroyed on a large scale , and recorded that when a @entity155 was killed in @entity201 , they burnt down more than 300 buildings			2
the catholic cardinal of the day called them ' a horde of savages , some of them simply brigands , burglars and thieves ' .			0
