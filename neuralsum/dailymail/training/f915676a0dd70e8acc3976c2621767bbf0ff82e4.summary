by @entity0 when @entity2 fell into with the wrong crowd at the age of 11 , her life took a chilling turn			1
what started with a few puffs of a cigarette eventually turned into a dangerous cocaine addiction			2
by 13 she ’d dabbled in cannabis , ecstasy and cocaine and by 15 was an everyday user			1
‘ i lost touch with my school friends and became mainly interested in drugs , which was really sad , ’ mum - of - one @entity2 , 30 , from @entity15 , told @entity16 and @entity17 on @entity19 ’s @entity18			1
the drug of choice at the time was coke and all other drugs - like cannabis and ecstasy - were for weekends			1
but cocaine became an everyday thing			2
it seemed normal to me , ' she admitted			0
‘ it was so expensive but it was being bought for me by the crowd i was in because they were older and earning money			0
and any money i had from birthdays or @entity48 i would spend on drugs			2
’ ‘ i knew my parents were so naive , which made me feel guilty			2
i knew in their wildest dreams they did n’t know what was going on			0
' @entity2 ’s mum @entity24 , who also appeared on the programme , explained : ‘ i did n’t see it coming			1
at 10 she was a lovely bubbly child who enjoyed sports and life and was always a pleasure to have around			0
i was very naive and i did n’t know anything about drugs			2
’ @entity2 and her mum @entity24 with presenters @entity17 and @entity16 when @entity2 started becoming difficult and moody , @entity24 did n’t suspect drugs were involved			1
‘ i thought it was just the teenage years – the stroppiness and going off to the room			0
i obviously wish i had been more knowledgeable			0
it did n’t twig until she was 15 when someone phoned me to let me know			0
‘ i ’ve never thought my children were angels , but i did n’t expect anything to this point			0
’ it was only when @entity2 confided in a family friend that @entity24 found out the truth			1
@entity2 was addicted to cocaine by the age of 15 ‘ it was a really traumatic time and obviously there was a lot of guilt , ’ @entity24 recalled			1
but even when her parents were trying to help her quit , @entity2 continued to take the class a drug : ‘ they tried everything , ’ she said of her parents ’ efforts			1
‘ they ’d lock me in my room , but i ’d climb out the window			0
it took the harshest of experiences for @entity2 to wake up to where her life was heading			1
‘ i ended up seeing people overdose , go to prison , and die			0
i realised it was not what i wanted			0
’ when all @entity2 's friends were doing their @entity99 ’s @entity2 was in rehab on day release			1
‘ i switched my whole group of friends and i was so grateful to my other friends who were still there for me , ’ she said			0
it ’s been 11 years since @entity2 has been clean and she ’s now trying to turn those years of addiction into a positive for other addicts , by helping parents spot the signs of drug abuse			1
‘ @entity113 and dad have always said that they wished they ’d known more and could have helped more			2
it ’s all well and good having the dangers of drugs being taught at school , but parents also need the knowledge and confidence and to talk about things			2
' @entity125 would have been better than a cure , ' she said			0
@entity2 has now produced a 40 - minute dvd for parents and teenagers called think about it , which tackles smoking , drinking , drugs as well as sex			1
@entity24 admitted , ‘ i wish there had been more out there about drugs at the time			1
i did n’t have a clue			0
’ @entity140 ’s dvd is available on her website , www.realiteen.co.uk			0
