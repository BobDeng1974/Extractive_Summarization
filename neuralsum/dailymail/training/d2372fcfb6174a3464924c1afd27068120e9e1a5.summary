’ col @entity1 said : ‘ whether or not @entity24 falls , the question of military intervention will remain a live issue			1
‘ @entity107 political leaders may have no appetite for deeper intervention			2
but as history has shown , we do not always choose which wars to fight - sometimes wars choose us			0
