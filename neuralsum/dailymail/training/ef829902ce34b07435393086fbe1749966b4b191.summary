@entity2 commandos are on the ground fighting in northern @entity4 , according to a published report , just a week after @entity0 said that would n't happen			1
and with a second brutal beheading in @entity8 , the president may soon have to decide how much more military might to deploy			0
even as he has authorized more than 100 target airstrikes against the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in @entity4 , @entity0 told the @entity12 on august 26 that ' @entity14 combat troops will not be returning to fight in @entity4			1
' ' i will not allow the @entity14 to be dragged back into another ground war in @entity4 , ' he said , adding later that ' the answer ' to @entity11 ' is not to send in large - scale military deployments that overstretch our military			1
' his parsing of words – ' combat troops ' and ' large - scale ' – now seem calculated to produce platoon - sized loopholes			2
the battle - scarred location , 30 miles from @entity48 and a bit further from @entity50 , had been the site of fierce fighting between @entity29 @entity54 forces and @entity11 militants			2
' they did n't wear any identifying insignia , ' the reporter added , ' but they were visibly western and appeared to match all the visual characteristics of @entity14 special operations soldiers			0
' this particular freelancer should know : he 's a 27 - year - old former @entity63 who served three tours in @entity4 and two in @entity67			2
a @entity54 commander , backed up by @entity29 intelligence sources , confirmed that ' yes , @entity71 and @entity14 forces are on the ground here			1
they are helping to support us in the attack			0
' but the @entity76 told the online news magazine monday night that ' there are no @entity14 troops on the ground in or around @entity46			1
' a spokesman for @entity82 said no @entity14 troops were involved in fighting there but a single airstrike in the area destroyed several vehicles monday			2
spokespersons for the @entity90 's @entity89 did not immediately respond to @entity92 's questions about the role of @entity2 near @entity46 , and about whether president @entity0 considers @entity94 who travel without @entity14 insignia to be ' combat forces			1
' they had a painful and busy morning : @entity11 released a video that shows the beheading of @entity14 journalist @entity101 , and said the murder was retaliation for continued airstrikes in @entity4			0
@entity101 is the second @entity14 journalist to be killed by @entity11 , and his death comes two weeks after @entity107 was executed in a similar video			0
the @entity4 military retook control of the northern town of @entity112 on sunday , aided by @entity54 who say they 're receiving help from @entity14 with boots on the ground in the video , titled ' a second message to @entity14 , ' @entity101 appears in a orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an @entity11 militant			1
the executioner appears to be the same man who killed @entity107 – known as ' @entity122 ' – and tells the camera : " i ’m back , @entity0 , and i ’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the @entity126 "			0
' @entity101 , 31 , freelanced for @entity128 and @entity129 magazines and vanished in @entity8 in august 2013			0
a retired @entity2 soldier told @entity92 on tuesday that most of the 100 - plus airstrikes the @entity76 has confirmed would have required ' some kind of boots on the ground ' to deliver real - time intelligence on airstrike targets – such as who is traveling in a convoy or which @entity11 leaders are in a building			1
they 're also useful for ' painting targets , ' he said , referring to a technique involving a laser , held by a nearby special operator and pointed at a target			0
some missile guidance systems can detect laser light and use it for precision guidance			0
and , the source added , ' if keyhole sat [ ellite ] images do n't confirm a ' kill , ' it helps to have ground forces who can find out for sure who we 've just taken out			0
' @entity14 and @entity71 special ops teams , the @entity40 reported , ' had taken up positions in @entity46 that allowed them to coordinate with @entity14 aircraft			1

president @entity0 said a week ago that no @entity14 ' combat troops ' would be fighting in @entity4
but @entity2 that looked like @entity14 were witnessed entering a combat zone near the @entity4 town of @entity46
@entity29 intelligence and military sources told the @entity40 that @entity71 and @entity14 forces were on the ground fighting with them
@entity0 's careful word - parsing could mean that @entity2 are ' painting targets ' with lasers for *airborne* missiles
