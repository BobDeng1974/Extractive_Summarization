fracking firms will be allowed to access vast reserves of underground gas without the permission of landowners under controversial laws being drawn up by the government			1
ministers are preparing an overhaul of trespass legislation to make it easier for firms to ignore objections			1
one source said the reform , which will infuriate anti-fracking campaigners , was likely to be included in the @entity16 setting out the government ’s plans for its final year			2
anger : police tackle protesters at @entity22 , @entity23 , who were objecting to a test - drilling site there chancellor @entity26 is offering generous tax breaks to kickstart the technology			0
he believes fracking for shale gas could herald an energy revolution that will boost the economy , make @entity33 more self - sufficient and put an end to sky - high bills from greedy energy firms			1
scientists say the @entity33 is sitting on deposits of enough shale gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years , mirroring the @entity42 oil boom of the @entity43			1
shale gas development has taken off in the @entity45 , using the controversial process of fracking – or hydraulic fracturing			1
underground gas deposits are extracted by fracturing shale rock with high - pressure blasts of water , sand and chemicals			1
opponents warn that the process risks causing earthquakes , polluting water , blighting the countryside and affecting house prices			1
shale gas exploration involves sinking a vertical well and exploring out from it horizontally , often for more than a mile			1
environmental campaigners and residents have demonstrated against fracking , clashing with police at well sites such as @entity22 , @entity23			2
under current law , firms need permission from owners of land over fracking tunnels			1
if the owners object , a developer has to take them to court to overturn their objections and agree compensation			2
resistance : police get to grips with another group of protesters at @entity22 last summer			0
the reform , which will infuriate anti-fracking campaigners , will make it easier to ignore local objections to drilling landowners in the @entity45 own any shale gas beneath their land , but in @entity33 it belongs to the @entity93 – or , in practice , the government			1
ministers are issuing licences for developers applying to sink exploratory wells			0
typically , fracking involves horizontal exploration a mile or more from the central vertical well , meaning many different landowners could be involved			2
however , laws dating back to the mid-sixties mean landowners must not withhold permission if drilling under their land is to go ahead			0
developers are able to try to overturn any such objection in court , but judges would consider why permission was withheld and whether reasonable efforts have been made to reach an accommodation			0
they could order compensation be paid even if they overturn an objection and cases can take years to resolve , creating an obstacle to development			2
@entity122 has started a campaign to get people in potential fracking sites to register objections to exploration under their land			1
landowners in the @entity129 , including @entity131 fund manager @entity130 , plan to use the existing law to block development			0
mr @entity130 said : ‘ people across the country have legitimate concerns about the impact of fracking , from water contamination to air and noise pollution			2
' but all this happening in a national park just does n’t bear thinking about			0
’ the reform of the law would extend the existing rights of water , gas and coal mining firms , set out in the @entity150 1998 , to go under people ’s land without permission			1
compensation of around £ 100 is likely to be offered to landowners			0
the revamp would also apply to the geothermal wells that harness heat from deep in the earth			0
developers need to drill on land in urban areas , with one proposed project in @entity164 likely to involve exploration under 5,000 homes			0
the @entity167 said : ‘ operators prefer to agree through negotiation with the landowner , but there is an existing legal route by which they can apply for access where this ca n’t be negotiated			0
we ’re considering whether this is fit for purpose			0

scientists say @entity33 is sitting on enough shale gas for 40 years ' supply
but *critics* warn fracking can pollute water and could cause earthquakes
new rules will make it easier to fracking firms to ignore objections
