by @entity0 , political reporter published : 20:45 est , 6 january 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 7 january 2013 former home secretary @entity1 believes voters blame @entity3 for the current deficit labour risks being seen as the party of ' scroungers ' by opposing a squeeze on benefits , according to former home secretary @entity1			1
railing against her party 's position on welfare , the former minister said party activists were being told on the doorstep that @entity3 was lacking ideas to cut the deficit			1
@entity17 has ordered his party to vote against freezing rises in benefit payments to 1 per cent for the next three years in the @entity21 tomorrow , instead of the inflation rate which is currently 2.7 per cent			2
the @entity3 leader has argued that most of those who will be affected are in work because the cap will also apply to tax credits			1
he called the policy an attack on ' strivers '			2
but tensions within his party emerged last month when a senior @entity3 figure had described the policy as ' politically suicidal ' and revealed a ' caucus of new @entity3 figures ' were set against it			1
this is because it left the party open to charges that it sided with ' scroungers ' and was ' in denial over the need to cut the benefits bill '			2
yesterday miss @entity1 weighed in to the debate , saying : ' frankly you can count me into this ' caucus '			0
it would include a large number of people [ @entity3 canvassers ] who 've knocked on doors recently and been told the problem for @entity3 is that they think we caused the deficit and they 're not yet convinced we know how we 'll solve it			1
' the @entity58 want to paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work			2
' a number of polls showing high levels of public support for a cap have painted @entity3 into a corner over its opposition to a freeze which would apply across the board except for carers benefits , some disability payments and the basic state pension			1
the @entity75 released figures yesterday showing that by opposing cuts to welfare spending , @entity3 would have saddled every working family with £ 5,000 of national debt by the next general election			1
they claim all welfare savings , including the move to aggregate most benefits into a @entity85 , the 1 per cent cap , changes to child and housing benefit and council tax , and a crackdown on fraud and error in the system will save £ 83billion by 2015 - 16			0
however @entity3 say 60 per cent of those who would be affected are in work and would be left struggling			2
ahead of the vote on the @entity99 , @entity97 said this argument was ' very odd ' as they had backed a 1 per cent pay freeze for public sector workers , who the prime minister said ' work hard and do absolutely vital jobs '			0
prime minister @entity97 told @entity106 's @entity105 that @entity3 opposition to a benefit freeze was a ' very odd argument ' mr @entity97 told the @entity106 's @entity110 : ' the @entity3 agree with the 1 per cent increase in public sector pay but they do n't agree with the 1 per cent cap on welfare			1
it 's a very odd argument to say people out of work , their incomes should be going up faster than people in work - we do n't think that is right			1
' @entity125 chairman @entity124 admitted there were probably ' a very small number ' of ' shirkers ' who preferred not to work			0
but he said the system under @entity3 was ' blatently unfair ' and so complex it prevented people working more hours			2
@entity134 mp , @entity3 's @entity135 and @entity136 , said : ' this government are handing a £ 107,000 tax cut to millionaires but hitting millions of soldiers , nurses , cashiers and electricians with a strivers ' tax that will cost them hundreds of pounds a year			1
' benefit claimants in the @entity147 could be paid less than those in the @entity149 to reflect the lower cost of living , if the @entity58 win the next election			0
it is one of the radical ideas for the next manifesto put forward by the influential 2020 @entity156 , including cabinet ministers such as @entity158 and @entity159			0
yesterday @entity160 attacked the ' lies ' about benefit scroungers yesterday , saying two thirds of those affects are in work , on low or middle incomes and two thirds and these are women			0
the shadow chancellor also backed the government 's cap on benefits of £ 26,000 per family to ' get a grip on the benefits bill ' , but that it should be higher in @entity175 , saying it could lead to homelessness if set too low			0
he said : ' there are people looking for work , who currently ca n't find work because the economy is in a bad state			0
these are n't the feckless , the work shy , people behind curtains whilst others go to work , these are striving people			0
' and why should they see their incomes cut while our prime minister at the same time is cutting taxes for the richest people ? '			0

former home secretary rails against her party 's welfare policy
voters blame @entity3 for economic crisis and do n't have faith in new policies
@entity189 says @entity3 want faster income rise for *unemployed* than those in jobs
