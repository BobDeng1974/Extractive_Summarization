but while policy makers are left scratching their heads , a group of @entity7 students believe they have come up with a waterworld - type solution to make use of the nutrient - rich water			0
their concept , dubbed @entity15 , envisions the creation of large villages and towns that float around the @entity19 while ‘ eating ’ icebergs			2
@entity15 makes use of the abundance of fresh - water icebergs by capturing them with its circular shape			2
it then uses their nutrient - rich water to grow crops arranged in a circular form , the @entity15 floats on the water and delivers icebergs into its central bay			1
here , freshwater from the iceberg goes to hydroponic greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables , which are then delivered to towns along the coast			1
solar panels would provide power for both plants and people during the long summer days			1
meanwhile an osmotic system , which generates power from a combination of saltwater and freshwater , fills in any energy gaps to power the community			1
they hope the floating hydroponic communities will help grow local food for @entity54 , which currently ships in almost all of its produce from overseas			0
‘ the floating facility is equipped to house a community of 800 people , inspired in its compact urban form by vertically oriented , bayside @entity54 villages , ’ wrote @entity59 , a student at the @entity60			0
ms @entity59 , who is working alongside fellow students @entity67 , @entity69 , and @entity70 , told @entity71 that they were struck by the idea that @entity54 's icebergs support such rich localised ecosystems			0
‘ an iceberg is an oasis , ’ she said			0
‘ we had what seemed to us a massive resource on one hand , and a massive lack - no local produce - on the other			0
’ the team hope the floating hydroponic communities will help grow local food for @entity54 , which currently ships in almost all of its produce from overseas the circular structure would have room to house 800 people			2
the largest area is dedicated to collecting water from icebergs			0
equipment to transfer the crops to local towns is also stored on board arranged in a circular form , the @entity15 floats on the water and delivers icebergs into its central bay			1
here , freshwater from the iceberg goes to hydroponic greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables , which are then delivered to towns along the coast			2
‘ the central bay is thus the heart of the @entity110 ’s agricultural process , the centre of its sustainable energy production , as well as an ice garden , offering social spaces and floating communal greenhouses for use by the inhabitants , ’ said ms @entity59			2
the propeller-less @entity15 would drift with the currents that carry the icebergs , often circling the ocean currents between @entity54 and the coast of @entity122			0

arranged in circular form , the @entity15 concept floats on the water and delivers icebergs into its central bay
freshwater from the iceberg goes into greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables which are then delivered to towns
solar panels would provide power for both plants and the 800 people living *onboard* during the long summer days
an osmotic system , which generates power from a combination of saltwater and freshwater , fills in any energy gaps
the team is currently working with @entity156 , a @entity157 - based consultancy , to develop their idea further
