by @entity0 he started off as a tubby little ball boy , trailing around after his older brother , who learned to play with power so he would n't have to run			1
now 19 - year - old @entity5 , the newest darling of @entity8 tennis , is preparing to play the match of his life : a final 16 showdown with @entity13 legend and world no 1 @entity15 on the hallowed grass of @entity17			1
@entity5 , just two weeks after being dubbed the ' next big thing ' by @entity19 , has stormed through the first three rounds at @entity17 , stealing headlines after his giant - killing display against @entity23 , in which he saved an incredible nine match points to shock the 13th seed			1
he will now face @entity13 legend @entity15 @entity5 spent his early years acting as his older brother @entity3 , with his mother @entity32 saying ' he was quite proud of himself , walking around collecting the balls ' but at the @entity35 home in @entity31 , his mother @entity32 waits for the rest of her family to let her know the results of each game , clutching at her @entity41 circular jade necklace - an exact replica of the one @entity5 wears - for good luck			1
the mother - of - three told the @entity45 that she gets far too nervous when watching him play at @entity17 , instead preferring to reminisce of ' little @entity5 's ' humble beginnings			1
' he started playing tennis because my eldest son , @entity48 who is eight years older than him , was a tennis player - but not to @entity5 's level , ' @entity32 said			1
' he was @entity51 ' ball boy – he would just follow him around and pick up his balls , and of course @entity48 had no mercy for his brother			1
@entity5 was a quite a chubby fellow at that age , and he was quite proud of himself , walking around collecting the balls			2
@entity5 ( right ) and his older brother @entity48 ( left ) : the brothers are still close and have been keeping in touch while @entity5 is @entity61 via text message @entity32 said her youngest son learnt his technique due to being ' too chubby ' to run , opting instead to gain an advantage by hitting the ball outside of his opponent 's reach to minimize how far he 'd have to run himself next big thing : @entity5 celebrates victory in the third round of @entity17 with his @entity8 supporters in tow ' but i felt sorry for him always following us around , so i asked him one day if he wanted to try			1
i gave him a try and , my god , he just whacked it ! he really whacked it ! and right over the net ! the hand eye coordination was just … wow ! so i kept feeding him balls			2
' just … wow ! this tubby little thing and that arm strength – my goodness ! it just started from there , but he did n't get a proper tennis lesson until he was about seven			2
' currently ranked no 144 in the world , @entity5 – who is of @entity41 and @entity90 decent - will enter the top 100 after fighting his way back from a set down to beat @entity94 @entity93 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 on saturday			1
other tennis stars are also confident that he could make it to the top , including @entity19 , ranked 5th in the world , who dubbed @entity5 the ' next big @entity8 star ' in a recent tweet			1
currently ranked no 144 in the world , @entity5 ( second from the right ) - who is of @entity41 and @entity90 decent - will enter the top 100 after wining against @entity94 @entity93 on saturday @entity5 began tennis lessons at seven years of age after his mum noticed how powerfully he would hit the ball ' i gave him a try and , my god , he just whacked it ! ... this tubby little thing and that arm strength ¿ my goodness ! it just started from there , ' his mother told the @entity45 but while the rest of the world ponders how the youngest man in the draw managed to rapidly make his way to the top after being ranked lower than 800th last year , @entity32 proves that mothers know best			1
' he was still tubby [ when he started his lessons ] because he did n't like to run , ' she laughed			0
' i keep saying to people – the best thing about that period was that because he could n't run to the ball , he would hit it super hard to a place so that the other guy could n't hit it back to him			0
' he was n't eating the wrong things , he was just eating too much , i mean @entity41 and @entity90 food – who could refuse ! so he was hitting so hard and accurate to the corners of the court because he could n't run after it ! ' talented from a young age : @entity5 won the former junior world championships as well as the @entity142 boys singles title in january 2013 @entity15 has admitted he is weary of his future opponent , saying ' he 's a young player and young players are very dangerous ' from the family album : @entity5 ( left ) said he could n't believe he would be facing @entity15 in his fourth round at @entity17 : ' i thought it would take years and years of work to finally have an opportunity like that ' the teenager is currently preparing for his fourth - round clash , set against 14 - times grand slam champion @entity15			1
@entity5 has meanwhile expressed his enthusiasm for the latest challenge , even suggesting he 's confident of a win			2
' i 'm overwhelmed with happiness			0
making my fourth round at a grand slam and the opportunity to play @entity15 , hopefully on @entity165 , it 's an opportunity i 'm just going to embrace , ' he said			2
' i never thought i would be seeing @entity15 in my fourth round at @entity17 in my 19th year			2
i thought it would take years and years of work to finally have an opportunity like that			0
' of course i have nothing to lose out there			0
' both of @entity5 's parents wear the same @entity41 circular jade necklace which their son wears to each of his games ( pictured ) for good luck @entity23 congratulates @entity5 after he beat him on thursday up next : @entity181 will face world no 1 @entity15 in the next round but it 's not just about winning , according to his mother , who is proud to see how far her youngest child has come			1
' at this stage i think it does n’t matter if he wins or not because he got to @entity15 on his own terms , not because it was a random draw pool – he got there himself , ' she said			0
' if he does win ? that will just be ridiculous ! i 'll have to call him and say " your mama wants to live – your mama does n't want to have a heart attack ! " ' ' i 'm super proud ! but , it 's not just " proud " , it 's just being happy that it 's jelling for him			0
he 's thinking about the right things on court			0
he has lost the plot before many times because of one bad call and he 'll be thinking about that and then lose the next two games when he should just move forward			0
' i 'm just super proud he ’s thinking about the game and not rushing			0
' humble beginnings : when asked how she would feel if ehr son won against @entity15 , @entity214 said ' that will just be ridiculous ! i 'll have to call him and say " your mama wants to live ¿ your mama does n't want to have a heart attack ! " ' raving : @entity19 is one of the stars to tout @entity5 as the next big thing family photo : from left to right , @entity5 's father @entity224 , his mother @entity32 , @entity5 , his brother @entity48 and his older sister @entity227 nonetheless , @entity32 guaranteed that she and @entity5 ’s father @entity224 , who is at @entity61 by his son 's side , will carry on wearing all their good luck charms until the end			1
both of them wear the same necklace as @entity5 , a @entity41 circular jade , while his superstitious father ensures he wears the same shirt and the akubra hat he was wearing during his son 's third win at every game			2
leading up to their game on monday , @entity243 has admitted to being weary of his future opponent			0
' he 's a young player and young players are very dangerous as always the young players have something special			0

' he has a great serve			0
