by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 21 march 2013 a sapphire ring found in a @entity4 field by a metal detecting enthusiast may have been owned by royalty in the 5th and 6th centuries , experts said today			1
archaeologists say that nothing like the @entity11 from that period has ever been found in the @entity13 before			2
the expert group , convened by the @entity15 in @entity16 , believes the ring could have royal connections			1
lucky : @entity19 found the 1500 - year - old ring in a field near @entity22 , south of @entity16 curator of archaeology at the museum @entity26 said : ' what this workshop has shown is that this sapphire ring is even more special than we had previously thought			1
' nothing like it has been found in this country from the 5th or 6th century			1
' the ring was found by metal detectorist @entity19 , from @entity16 and @entity35 , in 2009 as he searched a field near the village of @entity22 , south of @entity16			1
ancient : the ring is now believed to have belonged to royalty in the 5th and 6th centuries it measures around 2.5cm across and is intricately made of gold , prestige glass and a large sapphire			1
the initial assessment of its origin was that it was likely to be @entity50 or @entity51 , from the 10th or 11th century			2
5th century @entity52 was a tumultuous period with invasions from across @entity55 making it likely that the ring came from the continent			1
experts believe it may have then been given to someone from the ruling classes in @entity52 at some point in the 5th century , probably in the early @entity50 period			1
the end of @entity67 rule in @entity52 in 410 was followed by invasions from the @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and further @entity67 uprisings			0
the failing economy of the country led to civil war , widespread famine and changes in leadership across the century			0
corrupt leadership , more civil turmoil , public forgetfulness and individual apathy following the @entity85 at @entity86 , circa @entity80 , meant that @entity52 was ripe for the @entity50 picking			0
the @entity50 rule of @entity88 lasted for a further 500 years until the @entity89 in 1066			0
now the expert group has dated it to a much earlier period			2
they have also suggested the ring was made in @entity55 , possibly @entity95 , and that it would have belonged to a king , leader or consort - not a bishop which was a previous theory			0
the wear on the ring also suggests that it could have been a brooch first , which was later made into a ring			0
' it has been fantastic to hear the thoughts of some of the world 's leading experts and their suggestions will allow us to now go away and try and fit the ring into a historical timeframe , ' miss @entity26 said			2
' the general thought was that it was probably made on the continent and perhaps traded or gifted it to somebody in the ruling classes in @entity52			0
it was probably around the start of the @entity50 period			0
' hopefully this will lead us to finding out more about the ring and possibly even who might have owned it			2
' the workshop was attended by more than 30 experts from across the @entity13 and included a day of talks , presentations and discussion , the museum said			0
the expert group concluded the sapphire in the ring was probably cut earlier , possibly during the @entity67 period , but the ring itself was specially made around the sapphire			1
and , by looking at the wear on the ring they decided it was worn for at least 50 years before it was lost			0
the gold hoop that forms the ring also looks slightly different to the main part of the ring , with suggestions being made that it was turned into a ring later , possibly from a brooch or mount			2
a museum spokesman said another theory suggested during the meeting was that the ring was from a later period , perhaps the 8th or 9th centuries , but was inspired by earlier styles in both jewellery and perhaps surviving stonework in @entity4 dating from the 5th or 6th centuries			1
research : the @entity15 have raised £ 35,000 to buy the ring and conduct more studies he said further research was underway , in particular a search for any further archaeology or historical information which can link the ring to 5th or 6th centuries			1
this will be conducted initially by researchers from the @entity174			0
the @entity15 has raised £ 35,000 to buy the ring			1
this has been made possible with grants of £ 10,000 from the @entity178 , £ 10,000 from the @entity179 , £ 10,000 from the @entity180 and £ 1,000 from the @entity181 .			0
