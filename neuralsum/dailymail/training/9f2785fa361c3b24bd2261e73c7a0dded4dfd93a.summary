by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 07:25 est , 15 november 2012 @entity2 's new president @entity1 was officially introduced to the nation today , but to many @entity2 citizens it is the face of his glamorous pop star wife that will appear far more familiar			1
the @entity9 leader - elect and powerful military chief is married to @entity11 , the syrup - voiced megastar of popular @entity2 folk music			1
nicknamed the @entity14 , ms @entity11 , 49 , had graced television screens in the world 's most populous country for more than a decade , her honeyed tones punctuating state - run tv shows watched by hundreds of millions of people			1
ms @entity11 has become @entity2 's first high - profile political spouse since @entity22 , the late wife of chairman @entity23			1
power couple : @entity1 is married to @entity11 , the syrup - voiced megastar of popular @entity2 folk music her huge success in the entertainment industry has run alongside her staunch loyalty to the @entity9			1
she joined the @entity29 aged 18 and rose to the rank of major - general , a post she still holds			2
but when her superiors discovered her talent for singing , she began touring army bases serenading troops in a programme designed to boost morale			0
from there her rise to fame was meteoric			0
she is best known for performing at @entity44 's @entity43 - a show watched by hundreds of millions of people throughout @entity2 - almost every year since its inception in 1982			1
the peony fairy : ms @entity11 had graced television screens in the world 's most populous country for more than a decade , her honeyed tones punctuating state - run tv shows and @entity9 rallies the new team : he and the six other men who will form @entity2 's new collective leadership , all dressed in dark suits , walked in line onto the red - carpeted stage			1
( @entity63 ) @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity1 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
almost all of her songs are in praise of the @entity9 and frequently appears on state television to sing propagandist ballads with names including @entity76 and people from our village			0
in june 2011 , she was even appointed @entity80 for @entity81 and tuberculosis			0
she has also shied away from appearing in public with her husband or talking about their relationship until recently , fuelling speculation that she may take a more active role in his presidency than any of her predecessors			0
in a rare interview in 2007 , she told a state - run magazine : ' when he comes home , i ’ve never thought of it as though there ’s some leader in the house			0
' in my eyes , he ’s just my husband			0
when i get home , he does n’t think of me as some famous star			0
in his eyes , i ’m simply his wife			0
' but while hers is still one of the most famous faces in the country , comparatively little is known of her husband , a man who spent most of his teens living in a cave , labouring in the fields of one of @entity2 's poorest regions			1
he is the son of communist revolutionary general @entity114 , a comrade of chairman @entity23			0
but when he was in his teens , his father fell out with the chairman and was sent to prison			0
@entity1 was exiled to a far - flung , rural community of @entity120 , in @entity122 province , where he lived in cave - dwellings and was forced to labour in the fields			2
little more than 100 miles from @entity126 , it is one of @entity2 's poorest regions			1
the family lived like peasants in a cave - like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village			2
he is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man			0
but he immersed himself in local politics and soon rose the ranks before today assuming the top posts in the @entity9 and the powerful military in a political transition unbowed by scandals , a slower economy and public demands for reforms			0
@entity1 was introduced as the new party general secretary at @entity126 's @entity149 a day after the close of a week - long party congress that underlined the communists ' determination to remain firmly in power			1
get used to this face : @entity1 's inaugural address as the country 's new leader was broadcast on giant screens across @entity2			1
here , above a @entity160 's in @entity126 no everyone 's interested : a homeless man sleeps on the ground while people watch tv live broadcast of @entity2 's new members of the @entity167 out with the old : president @entity168 , left , and senior leaders mostly in their late 60s will hand over power to @entity1 , right , and other colleagues in their late 50s over the next several months new leader : @entity1 became @entity2 's new leader thursday , assuming the top posts in the @entity9 and the powerful military he and the six other men who will form @entity2 's new collective leadership , all dressed in dark suits , walked in line onto the red - carpeted stage			1
@entity1 's appointment as chairman of the military commission , announced by the state @entity185 , marked a break from the recent tradition of retiring leaders holding onto the post for a transitional period to extend their influence			2
it meant outgoing leader @entity168 would relinquish all positions of power , giving @entity1 broader leeway to consolidate his authority			2
no surprise : the once - a - decade leadership change was carefully choreographed			0
it became clear @entity1 would lead @entity2 five years ago @entity202 : the announcement was rubber stamped as the final day of the week - long congress drew to a close in the @entity149 hello and goodbye : @entity66 , left , also is due to take over from @entity208 , right , as premier the once - a - decade leadership change was carefully choreographed			1
it became clear @entity1 would lead @entity2 five years ago , when he was appointed to the @entity167 - the nation 's apex of power - as the highest - ranked member who would not be of retirement age this year			1
very little is known about @entity1 's upbringing - or his rise to power			1
he is married to a popstar called @entity11 who , for most of @entity1 's career , has been more famous than him			1
@entity2 often tell a well - known joke : ' who is @entity1 ? why , he is the husband of @entity11			1
' he is the son of communist revolutionary general @entity114 , a comrade of chairman @entity23			0
but when he was in his teens , his father fell out with the chairman and was sent to prison			0
@entity1 was exiled to a far - flung , rural community of @entity120 , in @entity122 province , where he lived in cave - dwellings and was forced to labour in the fields			2
little more than 100 miles from @entity126 , it is one of @entity2 's poorest regions			1
the family lived like peasants in a cave - like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village			0
he is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man			0
after leaving @entity120 , @entity1 headed to the busy coastal provinces that form @entity2 's industrial heartland			1
he quickly climbed the ranks to become the most senior party official first in @entity249 , before @entity250 and finally @entity251			0
there he developed the mind for business and economics that he is known for today			0
now with exports and the economy slowing , @entity2 hopes his skills can help get the nation back on track to overtaking @entity261 and becoming the biggest economy in the world			2
@entity1 's colleagues in the new @entity167 are @entity66 , the presumptive premier and chief economic official ; vice premier @entity65 ; @entity251 party secretary @entity67 ; propaganda chief @entity64 ; vice premier @entity68 ; and @entity268 party secretary @entity267			1
in a speech broadcast live on @entity2 state tv and worldwide , @entity1 said , ' we shall do everything we can to live up to your trust and fulfill our mission			2
' ' there are also many pressing problems within the party that need to be resolved , particularly corruption , ' @entity1 said			2
' we must make every effort to solve these problems			0
the whole party must stay on full alert			0
' the other six leaders were expressionless with their arms at their sides during @entity1 's 20 - minute speech , then smiled to the audience when they walked off stage			2
the son of a party elder , and vice president for the past five years , @entity1 will lead the world 's no. 2 economy and newest diplomatic and military power amid increasingly vocal calls for economic and political reform - including from within the 82 - million - member party itself			1
at ease in front of people and with colleagues , @entity1 takes over the party leadership from the stiff , technocratic @entity168 , and is expected to assume the largely ceremonial presidency in march			2
the ascent of @entity1 and @entity66 , the premier - in - waiting , represents a generational change			1
though they spent their youths laboring on farms , their university years and early careers took place when @entity2 was casting off the planned economy and turning to the free market and to the @entity318			2
they are thought to be more open to new ideas than their predecessors , but nonetheless bound by @entity2 's consensus - oriented politics			1
thursday marked only the second tidy transition since communist rule was established in 1949 , despite a turbulent political year that saw the downfall in a murder and corruption scandal of rising populist @entity328 , who had been seen as a key contender for the new leadership slate			0
the outgoing @entity168 oversaw a decade of turgid economic growth and urban development and tried to make concern for ordinary people the hallmark of his tenure , but he also will be remembered for harshly stifling dissent and rolling back civil liberties			0
at the same time , increased social freedoms have created a generation of @entity2 who are more aware of their rights and more vocal about demanding them .			0

@entity1 took over as party general secretary today , in @entity2 's second orderly power transfer in 63 years
but to many @entity2 , his wife @entity11 is far more famous as a syrup - voiced megastar of popular @entity2 folk music
but while she is one of the most famous faces in @entity2 , much less is known of her husband , who spent his teens living in a cave
in stark contrast to the nail - biting @entity261 election , who will govern has been decided in advance and behind closed doors by the authoritarian regime
mr @entity1 , *59* , is one of the select group of ' *princelings* ' descended from former party *grandees*
@entity66 also is due to take over from @entity208 as premier
