by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 insists he is over his @entity4 disappointment and believes the experience will help him realise his long - term ambition of becoming @entity7			1
the @entity9 goalkeeper called up to @entity11 ’s squad for @entity12 after @entity13 suffered a late injury and he made no secret that he wanted to force his way into the @entity7 head coach ’s plans for this summer ’s trip to @entity20			1
at the @entity22 in @entity23 12 months ago , for instance , @entity2 had said that “ @entity24 was on everybody ’s minds ” and repeated his aim last november			1
experience : @entity2 says he is enjoying his time in @entity30 , and is over the @entity4 disappointment always learning : the youngster has been called up to the national team but was snubbed for the @entity4 @entity2 , however , only played four times for @entity9 last season and was sent out on loan to @entity37 and @entity38 , with his international commitments limited to eight appearances for the under - 21s in their @entity43 qualification campaign			1
as a result , @entity2 , who will tonight captain the under - 20s against @entity46 in their latest assignment at the @entity48 , accepts he never gave @entity11 a serious decision to make about who would be @entity7 ’s third keeper in @entity20			1
‘ going to the @entity4 would have been a fantastic experience , ’ said @entity2 , who will go loan again next season if @entity54 remains at @entity9			1
‘ not being a part of the @entity4 has only given me more motivation and drive to push on and be a part of the next @entity22			1
‘ i ca n’t make a statement to myself if i ’m not competing at the same level as the guys who have gone			2
deep down i ’m gutted not to be going to the @entity4 as you always want to be part of major tournaments			1
‘ i ca n’t sit here , be frustrated or hold a grudge			2
if i was playing well in the @entity67 then i could say “ yeah , i can make a statement ” but that has n’t been the case			2
it ’s a target ( to progress ) for next season			2
‘ but coming here has been beneficial			2
facing top opposition will test us and help us if we want to win the @entity76 next summer			2
playing against these sides here is massively important for our development			0
the players want to be accustomed to playing against the top sides			0
’ representing : @entity2 was no 1 for @entity83 at the @entity84 losing to @entity20 in @entity85 on monday means @entity7 must beat @entity46 to stand a chance of qualifying for third - fourth place play - off and the 21 - year - old is praying for a better result than the last time he faced the same opposition			1
that was at the @entity92 in 2012 and he was powerless to prevent @entity46 winning a tense penalty shootout at the @entity94 5 - 4 ; the memory of failing to get near a single spot - kick still lingers			0
‘ the standard of the penalties they took was superb , ’ @entity2 recalled			1
‘ i was devastated because it was a one - off competition			0
but you ca n’t dwell on disappointments for too long			0
we have got to make sure we clinch third - place here now			0
‘ it would be massive to come in the top four of this tournament			2
we want to be in the top four , no matter which tournament we play in			2
we want to be in the top two , we want to be in the top team			0
those are the stages of tournaments we want to be regularly getting to in the future			0
’ lack of opportunities : @entity2 has struggled at @entity9 this season in @entity116 … @entity117 his goalkeeping idols @entity119 ( @entity120 and @entity121 ) – it is his presence , he is a bit nuts as well and i think you need that			1
his shot stopping and distribution too has been very good with @entity130 coming in			0
there has been a lot of pressure on him to play out from the back			0
he ’s done it very well			0
as a presence and a shot stopper he has been phenomenal			0
@entity140 ( @entity141 and @entity7 ) – when you have got the @entity7 no 1 tag , it brings a lot more pressure and attention			1
he has dealt with it fantastically in the time he has been @entity7 ’s no 1 and @entity141 ’s no 1			1
that is obviously the position i want to get to			0
when @entity156 is at his best , there are n’t many better			0
@entity157 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , probable ) : @entity2 ; @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 ; @entity162 , @entity163 ; @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 ; @entity167			1
tv : live on @entity169 from 6.15pm ( kick - off 6.30pm ) .			0

@entity2 not *surprised* he was *n't* *picked* for @entity7 *'s* @entity4 squad
says the experience at @entity30 tournament will benefit him
