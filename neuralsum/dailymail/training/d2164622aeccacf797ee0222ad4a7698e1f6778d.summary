a former policeman insists selling @entity2 state flags from his front yard was simply a shrewd business decision with the help from publicity that money ca n’t buy			2
@entity13 resident @entity12 claims within minutes of hanging the first @entity15 flag from his front yard two weeks ago , a taxi driver , that he described as of @entity11 appearance , knocked on his door in @entity17 , in the city ’s southeast , and bought it for $ 40			1
ironically , when mr @entity12 put the second flag out on display at 7am on wednesday , he claims another taxi driver , who he also describes as being of @entity11 appearance , purchased it just five minutes later			1
‘ people who are inclined to do what i would call – wicked things - or have a wicked frame of mind – are already that way , ’ he told @entity35			0
‘ they are made that way through their acquaintances , or in their mosque they listen to @entity45 geeing them up , or they see poison on the internet and that gets them going			0
’ ‘ you may get the odd nut ball who wants to undertake something but i do n’t think my flag is going to set him off			0
’ however , the shrewd businessman admits the timing of deciding to start selling the @entity15 flags was far from a coincidence			1
‘ i know jolly - well what i ’m doing when i hang up these contentious flags - it ’s not happenstance - i do it simply to get the publicity , ' he said			2
' the immediate aftermath is i get a huge amount of sales that lasts for several weeks afterwards which is publicity i could n't afford to pay for			0
' ' i know what i 'm hanging up in the morning and why and it brings people			0
' not a stranger to controversy , mr @entity12 experienced a boost to his sales in 2012 after receiving publicity for selling @entity77 flags			2
mr @entity12 denies that by selling the extreme terrorist regime ’s flags , which he purchased from a @entity27 supplier , he is encouraging terrorism this time around , he has received visits from the local police following complaints and even an @entity86 agent asking him to assume the role of a ‘ community leader ’ by providing authorities with car registration details of customers who buy contentious items			1
‘ when people come onto my premises they come in good faith and i enter into a contract with those people by selling them a flag , ' he said			0
' they trust me not to pass on their details and i do n’t think it ’s my job to do that			0
' mr @entity12 , who is not breaking any law , will continue to sell @entity15 flags if he can continue to buy them from suppliers			1
the 62 - year - old , who has been selling flags for five years , said he never asked customers why they chose particular designs			1
‘ i ’m not interested in why they want it i do n’t care if they want to hang it up as a curtain or outside their house or put it on their bed and have sex on it – i really do n’t care , ’ he said			0
an @entity86 agent asked mr boot to provide car registration details of customers buying contentious items			1
