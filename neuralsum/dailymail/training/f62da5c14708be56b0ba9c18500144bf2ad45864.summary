by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor prime minister @entity2 , pictured arriving at the @entity3 , said he was confident his plan to renegotiate @entity7 's @entity6 membership would be successful @entity2 today signalled he would call for @entity7 to leave the @entity6 if @entity8 refuses his demands for change			1
the prime minister said he would not ' sit on the fence ' in the in - out referendum he has vowed to hold by the end of 2017 , after trying to renegotiate the @entity7 's membership			1
but he repeatedly insisted he remains confident his plan to overhaul the @entity6 's powers will be successful			1
the pm wants to make it harder for migrants to claim the dole , stop child benefit being sent to families living across the @entity6 , a guarantee that @entity7 will never be forced to join the @entity22 and an exemption from the aim of ' ever closer union '			1
@entity27 chancellor @entity26 and @entity29 pm @entity28 has suggested they are willing to act on benefits and red - tape			0
mr @entity2 said he was increasingly confident that a deal could be reached			1
the renegotiation is expected to start soon after the general election in 2015 , before a promised in - out referendum before the end of 2017			2
but mr @entity2 faced repeated questions about whether he whether he would back leaving the @entity6 if his renegotiation failed			1
asked by the @entity3 's @entity39 if he would give a clear recommendation to the @entity7 people to vote yes or no in the referendum , mr @entity2 replied : ' of course , i am not going to sit on the fence			1
' he added : ' we have the referendum whether or not i have successfully negotiated			0
i think the negotiation will be successful			0
' he insisted that he is confident of reaching agreement across to @entity6 for changes which means he could recommend staying in			2
' i am tremendously upbeat , bullish and optimistic about what @entity7 can achieve in terms of our our economy but also our place in @entity58			2
' mr @entity2 reiterated his pledge that he will not become prime minister if he can not deliver an in - out referendum			1
it means that such a vote will be a deal breaker for any future coalition with the @entity66			0
it also suggests mr @entity2 would quit as @entity69 leader , rather than lead a minority conservative government			2
with less than two weeks to go until the @entity58 elections , mr @entity2 set out more of the changes he wants to see in @entity7 's relationship with @entity8			1
he said : ' we are very clear about what we want to achieve			0
let 's end benefit tourism , let 's make sure the single market is properly safeguarded			1
' let 's make sure that @entity81 can get together and block unwelcome proposals from the @entity83			0
' let 's make a series of changes to make @entity58 more flexible , more competitive			0
those are the sorts of things i want to see			0
' the prime minister was repeatedly challenged by the @entity3 's @entity93 about what he would say at the referendum if his renegotiation fails , something he is confident will not happen the government has already increased to the three months the time migrants must wait before they can claim benefits after they arrive in the @entity7			1
mr @entity2 said he wanted the limit to be much longer , adding : ' we need to make sure that the freedom to move to work is about just that			2
it 's to go and get a job , it 's not to claim			0
' he also wants to stop millions of pounds being sent abroad each year in child benefit for children who live elsewhere in the @entity6			2
there are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children , with two - thirds of the children based in @entity116			0
mr @entity2 said he had not made ' anybody who thinks that is sensible ' but admitted that under existing @entity6 rules ' it seems impossible to change that '			1
the prime minister said he could ' absolutely ' give a cast - iron guarantee that the vote would go ahead in 2017 if he is returned to @entity124			1
before going head - to - head with the @entity3 's @entity39 , the prime minister popped into a nearby @entity126 but the comment will draw unhelpful comparisons with his last ' cast - iron ' promise - to hold a referendum on the @entity131 - which never happened because the treaty was passed by the @entity6 before mr @entity2 came to power			1
earlier mr @entity2 told sceptics that he ' gets it ' after previous plans to offer them a referendum on @entity7 membership of the @entity6 did not materialise			1
but the @entity69 leader insisted that his party is the only ' credible ' option			0
the @entity142 face an electoral drubbing on may 22 , possibly even pushed into third behind @entity145 and @entity146			0
@entity145 leader @entity147 has boasted that he will trigger a ' political earthquake ' by topping the polls			0
earlier mr @entity2 issued a direct plea to undecided voters to back his plans for @entity58 in this month 's elections - but admits that he understands their doubts over his ability to deliver			2
' @entity156 ' : mr @entity2 seemed to attack politicians like @entity147 for being overly negative mr @entity2 launched attacks on @entity146 - who are not offering voters a choice on @entity58 - and said that they are ' flailing around ' on the @entity162 also hit out at @entity145 , characterising them as ' doom - mongers ' who are convinced @entity7 's best days are over			1
writing in the @entity166 , he said that ' there is only one party with a credible plan in @entity58 ' , before reiterating his aim of securing concessions from the @entity6 on immigration , trade , justice and ending the commitment to ' ever closer union '			2
pre-empting doubts over whether he will follow through on his promises , he said : ' if you ’re reading this thinking “ i ’ve heard all this before ” – i get it			0
' i was watching , too , when @entity146 made @entity7 the doormat of @entity58 and signed @entity7 taxpayers up to eurozone bail - out funds			2
so i understand the scepticism			0
' he then boasted of ways the @entity189 had saved taxpayers from paying for bail - outs and a higher @entity6 budget , before repeating his recent promise to resign if the referendum does n't @entity194 prime minister also took an apparent swipe at mr @entity147 , mocking his pessimism , although he does not directly name him , with a reference to @entity201 character @entity200			1
he said : ' there are politicians who refuse to be upbeat about @entity7			2
to them , pessimism equals patriotism			0
they insist that our best days are behind us and that everything is bound to get worse			0
' like @entity200 politicians they 're perennially crying out that ' we 're all doomed '			0
' by contrast , mr @entity2 said that he and his party are ' optimistic ' about the future of @entity7			1
polling has indicated @entity147 's party will come first in the @entity7 's @entity218 results , with the @entity69 pushed into a humiliating third place .			0

@entity2 says he will not ' sit on the fence ' and would call for @entity7 to leave
