@entity0 , president of the @entity1 , says parents who pay for their children to go to private schools should not pay for pupils from state schools private schools should not be expected to open up their facilities to pupils from local state schools , a leading headmistress said yesterday			1
@entity0 , president of the @entity1 ’ @entity1 , said it was ‘ beyond the pale ’ for the government to insist that private schools share their ‘ unique selling points ’ , such as facilities and resources , with the ‘ competition ’			1
she said that middle class parents who manage to find the money for private school fees should not be expected to bankroll state pupils who want to use the same resources			1
her comments are likely to spark fierce debate among private school heads , many of whom justify their schools ’ ‘ charitable ’ status by stressing the ways in which they share facilities with local state schools and the community			1
@entity35 and education secretary @entity36 have praised this practice and urged independent schools to go further , pooling their ‘ dna ’ with state schools by extending financial backing and lending their ‘ brands ’ to academies			2
but mrs @entity0 , head of @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , said parents already faced increasing fees due to the growing weight of regulation and red tape that private schools must follow			1
she said they should not be expected to pay for an independent education only to see the money spent on ‘ local competition ’			2
she questioned why , for example , private schools should help set up combined cadet forces ( ccfs ) for state pupils			1
mrs @entity0 stressed that many private schools were keen to help the state sector ‘ on their own terms ’ but said it was wrong for the government to impose the practice			1
‘ @entity36 has been very clear about the rules of co-operating with us , asking us to share our resources or facilities , ’ she told the @entity1 ’s annual conference in @entity46			0
‘ many of us happily do this already with a wide variety of schools on our own terms			0
‘ but when we are squeezed between the tightening rules and regulations being imposed upon us , the rising cost of our provision and the ability of middle - class parents to pay our increasing fees , it seems a bit beyond the pale to ask if we will share aspects of our unique selling points with local competition			2
‘ and competition it is ; why should my school offer its @entity60 expertise and experience to parents who could have sent their children to my school , but chose not to , or to a government which criticises my morality ? ‘ the current government can not decide whether they are for or against independent schools : they want our dna , our sponsorship of academies , but we know academies are not the answer to everyone ’s prayers			1
’ mrs @entity0 said many private school heads backed an ‘ open access ’ scheme with poorer parents given financial help to give their children an independent education			2
pm @entity35 wants greater sharing of resources between state and independent schools ( stock image ) fees would depend on parental income , with the wealthiest paying full fees and others paying nothing and the government making up the shortfall			2
in a wide - ranging speech , she also forecast that pupils will be able to play video games and learn from the comfort of their homes using web - based lessons and @entity135 in ‘ @entity137 schools ’ of the future			0
@entity140 ’s school system was failing to keep up with 21st century technology and must modernise to equip pupils with the skills they will need in the future , she added			0
her call came days after mr @entity36 announced plans for a computer science curriculum with the same status as traditional subjects			0
pupils as young as seven could be required to learn how to ‘ code ’ computer programs			0
mrs @entity0 said she was calling for more ‘ creative curriculum decisions ’			0
meanwhile , it was revealed thousands of places at the @entity140 ’s top universities were left empty as a result of the government ’s higher education reforms			0
the 11,500 unfilled spots at @entity163 universities were an ‘ unintended consequence ’ of the overhaul of the university sector , said professor sir @entity167 , vice-chancellor of @entity168 .			0

@entity0 criticises plans for private schools to share resources
' parents should not be forced to pay for state pupils '
but many independent schools share resources to get ' charitable ' status
