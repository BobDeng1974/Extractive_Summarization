by @entity0 published : 15:16 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 7 october 2013 it is the world 's biggest celebration of beer , beloved by @entity4 and the thousands of tourists who annually flock to @entity7			1
but even the lederhosen - clad drinkers of @entity10 know that all good things must come to an end , as the final steins of beer were poured this afternoon			2
the traditional festival , which has been going strong since 1810 , was ended this afternoon with a gun salute in front of a monument in honour of @entity20			1
fire ! the traditionally - clad mountain riflemen 's association fired a round to mark the end of the festival ceremonial : the so - called @entity26 took place this afternoon at the @entity20 monument in @entity7 finale : the gun salute is carried out with a special , curved handgun @entity32 ! the @entity4 equivalent of ' cheers ' rang out across the drinking halls of @entity20 over the past weeks , as this barmaid served up beers to all and sundry the so - called @entity26 ceremony was carried out by the traditionally - clad mountain riflemen 's association , to bring down the curtain on the festival , which has run since 21 september			1
the festival , which has just been repeated for the 180th time , reliably draws in some 6million visitors , who polish off some 7.5million litres of beer between them , traditionally served in huge stein glasses which hold almost two pints			1
revellers this year will have found the festival pricier than ever , with the average beer clocking in at € 9.66 ( £ 8.15 ) , but the steadily rising prices but the 3.6 per cent hike is unlikely to have dampened the spirits of this year 's revellers , who have taken up the traditional outfits of stretchy leather lederhosen for men and drindl dresses for women more enthusiastically than ever before			1
tradition : the floridly - dressed characters of @entity10 have been out in force since september 21 crowds : more than 6million people thronged the streets of @entity7 over the duration of the festival @entity68 drinking : this beer tent was filled with revellers hunting for one last stein before the festival ended the folksy get - ups , on sale in the capital for around € 50 , have been a particular hit among the city 's youth , as well as visiting tourists , who would not have touched the old - fashioned gear a few years ago			1
' i wanted to be part of the local atmosphere			0
everyone was talking about it , ' said @entity86 , a 20 - year - old from @entity88 who is studying in @entity90			0
she came to @entity10 with her friend @entity91 from @entity92			0
both women bought dirndls near the @entity10 tents			0
old - school : the traditional drindl dress was a popular choice among young women at @entity10 pricey : despite their obvious enthusiasm , these beers will have set the revellers back by around £ 40 masses : huge numbers of drinkers flood the city every year to quaff beer , eat pretzels and dance to oompah music @entity111 : this visitor went to extreme lengths to get her hands on a prized stein ' everybody told me it would be nicer if i wore it , ' @entity116 said			2
' otherwise you 'll look like a tourist			0
' but today 's revival is the most pronounced , said @entity124 , a professor in folklore and ethnology at @entity7 's @entity127			1
' it 's taken on a whole new dimension , ' @entity124 told @entity130			0
she said globalisation had created a desire for people to seek out local specialities			0
hefty : vast amounts of meat and bread are also consumed at @entity10 youthful : young locals and tourists are also said to be embracing the festival spirit as never before on trend : @entity144 , sported here by these five women , are available throughout @entity7 for around ¿ 50 ' what 's old is cool now , ' said @entity148 , a 25 - year - old student from @entity149 at @entity10			1
even @entity150 got in on the action , donning a red drindl in @entity153 for a similar folk festival			0
the festival , which was originally held entirely in october , has been an important part of local culture since 1810 when it was first held to celebrate the wedding of @entity20 's crown prince			0
every year the festival starts with the city 's mayor - currently @entity162 - inserting a tap into the first keg of @entity10 beer on the first morning			2
@entity166 is ! @entity7 mayor @entity162 began the festival this year by tapping a keg with the traditional cry with a traditional cry of ' @entity170 is ! ' ( ' it 's tapped ! ' ) , the festival begins as the mayor hands the first stein to the serving governer of @entity20			1
the festival , which also featured pretzels , fairground rides and traditional brass ' oompah ' music has become ever more elaborate over the years as more and more people from around the world come in droves to get a taste of the action			2
more than 6.9million people are thought to have attended the festival this year , though estimates show they are mostly locals , with only 20 per cent of drinkers coming from abroad			2
the quantity of beer consumed - usually in one - litre ' stein ' glasses - is likely to have topped 7.5million litres , and similar awesome amounts of food will have been drunk			1
it has been projected that 509,000 roast chickens , 59,000 pork knuckles , 116 whole oxen and 85 calves will be consumed during the festival			0
based on the average cost of a stein , beer - sellers will have taken more than £ 61million over the festival			2
all the steins in @entity10 tents are clear glass , so that drinkers can see for certain that their glass has been filled full			0
only @entity7 - based breweries can sell beer in @entity10 tents , and they must also meet stringent purity tests			1
only six breweries fit the bill at present			0
and , despite its folksy image , @entity10 can also be a rowdy event , @entity4 magazine @entity211 reported that police responded to 201 incidents on the first day of the festival .			1
