president @entity0 made time for beer and billiards in @entity3 , but wo n't go near a humanitarian crisis in @entity5 , a disgusted @entity7 member of @entity8 from the @entity9 said wednesday			1
rep. @entity10 crossed his party to say he is ' very very upset ' with @entity0 for choosing a photo op with @entity3 gov. @entity13 over a chance to see firsthand how his administration is handling a flood of young illegal immigrants who have trekked to the @entity18 from three @entity20 countries			1
' he 's so close to the border			0
and let me say this : when i saw , and i hate to use the word bizarre , but under the circumstances , when he is shown playing pool in @entity3 , drinking a beer , and he ca n't even go 242 miles to the @entity5 border ? ' @entity10 added that the federal government is ' holding some of the young kids from the border ' at @entity32			1
' he could at least make that trip to @entity34 , ' he said			0
' ' it just floored me , ' a visibly perturbed @entity10 told @entity53 host @entity52 , ' because if he ’s saying he 's too busy to go down to the border , but you have time to drink a beer , play pool – the optics and the appearance just mean he 's not paying attention to this humanitarian crisis			1
' @entity10 told @entity62 on wednesday morning that the @entity63 has already pressured him to keep quiet			2
@entity0 will be in @entity5 on wednesday afternoon and evening for @entity7 fundraisers in @entity65 and @entity66			1
it 's as close to the crisis as he 's traveled since the human deluge became a public scandal			2
during the first speech of his two - day trip , @entity0 did n't mention the border situation , saying only that his flavor of ' immigration reform ' is ' supported by a majority of @entity18			1
' @entity77 was first to report last week that the president would steer clear of the state 's besieged border with @entity81			1
@entity83 @entity82 said tuesday on the same network that that the @entity86 @entity18 border ' deserved a presidential visit			1
' i think a visit by the president is reaffirming that the borderlands along the southwest border are vital and important to this nation , ' he said , ' so i think a visit would be important and very symbolic			2
' ' this issue is n't going to go away ... while he 's in @entity66 and @entity65 , ' @entity82 insisted			0
humanitarian disaster : young girls and boys are trapped in detention facilities after crossing the @entity18 - @entity81 border -- tens of thousands have descended on @entity5 and @entity102 since last year this child , not that child : @entity0 hugged a young girl in @entity106 but has no plans to see thousands of less fortunate children massed on the @entity18 border a few hundred miles south of his @entity5 travel swing buzzfeed on wednesday quoted unnamed @entity7 members of @entity8 who called @entity0 's failure to see the border crisis firsthand ' confusing , ' ' baffling ' and ' a little offensive			1
' @entity117 scribe @entity116 added on @entity53 that ' it 's a little bit weird , because it seems like he is already in a hole , and he 's keeping on digging			0
' @entity0 is behind the eight ball not only because of his casual game of pool with the @entity3 governor , but also because of @entity127 ' claims that his 2012 immigration policy shift created the humanitarian disaster			1
he declared a two - year moratorium that summer on deporting illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity18 as children			1
another two - year delay was announced last month			0
reports have swirled during the spring and summer that opportunistic human smugglers misinterpreted the policy to make @entity20 believe their own children could escape endemic violence and poverty by making a dangerous trip to the north			0
rep. @entity10 has bucked his party by insisting that president @entity0 should visit the border to see the humanitarian mess firsthand as if a thank - you for the inspiration to come to @entity18 , some illegal immigrant children have reportedly been entering the @entity18 wearing @entity0 - themed sneakers featuring ' @entity150 ' artwork and the president 's face			1
online commentator @entity153 first published the photos on @entity155 , later adding on his website that they came from someone affiliated with @entity18 @entity159			0
' these pictures were taken from a friend who works at the processing center in @entity5 , ' read a note that @entity153 said he received with the images			0
' these are being worn by an illegal who will soon be released into the general public			0
' laughing it off : @entity0 smiled and laughed as someone in the @entity106 crowd asked if he wanted a hit of marijuana ' for people who may think this is a fake picture , notice the shoe laces			2
we make everyone remove their laces			0
' a few @entity7 are publicly sticking up for the @entity63 , most notably the far - left @entity5 rep. @entity180 , who said on @entity181 that a @entity63 request for $ 3.7 billion in supplemental funding was the best course			1
' the president knows @entity5 very well			2
i ’m very confident he ’s attending to serious issues by putting forth the supplemental , ' she said			0
' he ’s going to meeting with local officials , some of whom i ’ve already spoken to			0
we have been to the border , many of us			0
his cabinet members have been to the border			0
i think we will see that visit as time proceeds			0
' @entity0 will meet with ' local elected officials and faith leaders ' about the border crisis in @entity65 before his first political fundraising engagement on wednesday , according to the @entity63			1
as that meeting began , the @entity63 hastily announced that @entity0 would deliver public remarks less than an hour later about the border crisis			1
he will also make time for a private sit - down with @entity5 gov. @entity206			1
@entity207 reported , however , that @entity0 's handlers said he would ' get in the way ' of @entity159 efforts if he went			2
' it 's a no - win situation in some ways , ' network @entity63 correspondent @entity211 said wednesday			1
' if he goes there , what does he do ? does he give a speech ? does he meet with the children ? ' @entity127 in @entity8 continue to point out a connection between @entity18 's porous southern border and @entity0 's repeated demands for ' comprehensive immigration reform			1
' hanging out with @entity222 ? @entity0 yukked it up with well - wishers in @entity106 , including a man wearing a horse - head costume @entity5 @entity227 rep. @entity227 said tuesday that @entity0 's $ 3.7 billion request should go unanswered until his administration spends its existing budget to secure the border			1
' this is n’t a funding problem , ' @entity227 said on @entity234			0
' it ’s an enforcement problem			0
rather than enforce our nation ’s immigration laws , the president has chosen to ignore them			0
instead he continues to call for massive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants			2
' @entity0 , he said , ' has no one to blame but himself for the current crisis on the southern border			2
he granted amnesty to illegal immigrant minors by promising not to deport those brought to the @entity18 illegally by their parents			2
' as a result , tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are now flooding across the border			1
' @entity256 @entity255 sen. @entity255 added on @entity181 that for a fraction of the @entity63 's request , @entity8 could repatriate each of the illegal immigrant children – in style			2
' look , for $ 8 million , we can put them all on a first - class seat back to their homes , ' he said on the @entity268 program			0
' that 's $ 8 million			0
that 's a first - class seat , one way , to each of their homes			0

when the president touches down in @entity5 for two @entity7 fundraisers , he wo n't go near the @entity18 - @entity81 border
some *democrats* *complain* that @entity0 drank beer and shot pool with @entity3 gov. @entity13 but will make no time for a border visit
@entity0 aides , however , insist that the president might ' get in the way ' if he traveled to the @entity289 *valley*
one @entity5 @entity7 *congressman* says the @entity63 has already *warned* him to dial back his *criticisms*
some illegal immigrants are showing up at the border wearing @entity0 - themed sneakers featuring ' @entity150 ' artwork and the president 's photo
@entity0 never mentioned the border crisis during a speech wednesday in @entity106
