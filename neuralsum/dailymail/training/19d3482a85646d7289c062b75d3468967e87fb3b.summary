@entity1 mayor @entity0 warned residents to ' reconcile yourselves with your @entity4 ' because the ' furious hoarfrost bearing down upon us knows neither mercy or reason '			1
the mayor was poking fun at his over-reaction to the east coast winter storm @entity14 warnings by reading a article from the satirical newspaper @entity16			1
in the story , @entity0 warns @entity1 about the killer storm , but in reality less than 10 inches of snow fell in the city			1
' all shall meet their death in the coming tempest , ' de @entity0 said , reading from the satirical piece			0
although the mayor took the opportunity to make fun of the situation , he and governor @entity49 staunchly defended their unprecedented , stringent restrictions on city residents in the lead up to the storm			1
both said that they believed in erring on the side of caution and suggested they would take such measures again if presented with a similar situation			0
' would you rather be ahead of the action or behind ? ' de @entity0 asked @entity38			0
' would you rather be prepared or unprepared ? would you rather be safe or unsafe ? ' to me it was a no - brainer : we had to take precautions to keep people safe			0
' before the heavy snows reached @entity1 , officials closed schools , shut down bridges and tunnels , canceled commuter rail services and , for the first time in a snowstorm , closed the city 's sprawling subway system at 11pm on monday			1

restrictions : officials closed schools , shut down bridges and tunnels , canceled commuter rail services and , for the first time in a snowstorm , closed the city 's sprawling subway system at 11pm on monday ' to me it was a no - brainer : we had to take precautions to keep people safe , ' explained the @entity1 mayor however , the meteorologists whose forecasts prompted the action this week were wrong and the storm , while powerful on @entity103 and in @entity104 , dropped less than a foot of snow on the city			1
@entity109 director @entity108 said his agency should have done a better job of communicating the uncertainty in its forecast			0
@entity109 forecaster @entity114 tweeted an apology : ' you made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right , and we did n't			0
' the decision to lock down the city - particularly closing the subways - drew significant criticism from some business owners and transit advocacy groups			2
for @entity0 and @entity49 , however , mistakes made during previous storms likely guided their decisions			0

the storm resulted in miles of unplowed roads , stranded ambulances and angry residents stuck in their homes for days			0
defence : governor @entity49 ( pictured ) said his decision to act aggressively stems from the historic storm that covered @entity141 with seven feet of snow last year weather forecast : the meteorologists whose forecasts prompted the action this week were wrong after that debacle , @entity147 held a series of press conferences before , during , and after expected storms			1
in these events , the mayor , flanked by his commissioners , delivered an avalanche of statistics to reassure residents of the city 's readiness for the approaching snowstorm			1
there were no reported fatalities in @entity1 in the latest storm			1
the city did , however , lose about $ 200 million in economic activity due to the decision to shut down the transit system , according to a preliminary estimate from @entity169			2
@entity49 acknowledged that his decision to act aggressively stems from the historic storm that blanketed @entity141 with seven feet of snow late last year			2
' we make big decisions based on these weather forecasts , ' the governor said			0
' we decided not to close the roads in @entity141 ... and we had people stranded on the roads for 12 , 15 , 20 hours			2
you can have a significant loss of life in these situations			0
