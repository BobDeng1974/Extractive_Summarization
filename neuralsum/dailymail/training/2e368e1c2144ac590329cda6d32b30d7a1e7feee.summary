the @entity8 initially dismissed the suggestion that the market was overheating			1

chancellor of the exchequer @entity7 said the @entity8 was vigilant about the rising cost of property in many areas and would intervene if needed it is feared under help to buy there is a danger that people were borrowing more than they could ever pay back the latest figures show that the average cost of a house bought using the scheme 's mortgage guarantee is £ 148,048			1
the @entity72 and @entity73 are the most popular areas for @entity63 to buy , and the scheme is overwhelmingly benefiting first - time buyers			2
