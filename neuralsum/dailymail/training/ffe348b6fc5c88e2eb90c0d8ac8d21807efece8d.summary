by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 06:25 est , 27 january 2014 completing the perfect three - point turn can be tricky at the best of times , so spare a thought for this man who is forced to pull the manoeuvre on a narrow road halfway up a mountain			2
not only does the @entity11 driver , @entity10 , 43 , have to complete the turn at dizzying heights , he also has to do it while hauling 200 - tonnes of wood			1
amazingly he does this twice a day , every day , and has never made a mistake - so far			0
amazingly he completes the turn twice a day , every day the logger gingerly backs towards the cliff edge , swinging the empty rear trailer out and over the ledge @entity29 , who began driving trucks aged just 19 , has to do the perilous turn in the mountains of @entity33 , near @entity34			1
he said : ' i have done this so many years that it 's second nature now			0
however , he added : ' i can understand why people find it scary			0
' in the pictures he can be seen backing his truck towards the cliff edge , and even allowing the back part of the trailer to hang part - way off the mountain while he completes the turn			1
held , who began driving trucks at 18 , says he has never had a problem , but can see why it might scare people halfway through the turn the rear carraige can be seen dangling as @entity10 swings the front end around moving very carefully , the logger then swings the front part of the lorry around to face towards the right hand side of the picture , before pulling away			1
the images are reminiscent of the infamous @entity64 in @entity65 , dubbed the world 's most dangerous because of it 's narrow , crumbling track which cars can barely pass on @entity70			0
it is thought that between 200 and 300 travellers are killed crossing it every year , and the path is marked with crosses where vehicles have fallen			0
easy does it : after some delicate positioning held is pointing in the right direction and ready to drive away and he 's off : held has survived this time , but will have to complete the turn again later			2

@entity10 , 43 , completes the dangerous turn twice a day
held is an experienced logger in the @entity11 mountains
he says he has never had a problem but can see why it is scary
