as police and search crews scour the seas around @entity4 and @entity5 for missing jet @entity6 , a satellite company is letting web users around the world help in the hunt online			1
@entity11 has spent the last five days uploading high - resolution satellite and aerial images to its @entity15 site that let people explore the seas for clues about the crash , as well signs of a wreckage or oil slick			1
images are then tagged by users and analysed by experts before the most significant sightings are sent to the search teams in @entity28			1

hijacking : radar data indicates the plane might have made a u-turn			2
a pilot error : there is a chance of them in all air mysteries , claim experts structural failure : possibly involving damage sustained by an accident in 2012 pilot suicide : there were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s caused by this @entity76 black hole : plane is stranded hundreds of miles from current search area @entity15 user @entity33 tagged an image taken on sunday morning , which appears to show the outline of a plane underwater			1
he is unsure of the exact location but is hoping the sighting will soon be verified			0
@entity33 told @entity86 : ‘ at first , i skipped past it , thinking , ' nah			0

air traffic control in @entity4 said it was handing the jet over to controllers in @entity110 before contact was completely lost			0
@entity11 has already uploaded 1,300 square miles ( 3,200 square kilometres ) of imagery on to its crowdsourcing site , @entity15 , and is adding more as and when it becomes available			1
@entity4 's department civil aviation director general , @entity115 , pictured left , with @entity92 ceo @entity116 , pictured right , during a press conference on the new search area more than 25,000 people have already signed up to help search for the plane online			1
initial search efforts concentrated on waters between @entity4 and @entity5 before being extended to the @entity124 and the @entity125			0
@entity127 imagery , pictured , is being uploaded to reflect this change more than 25,000 people have already signed up to help search for the plane , and as a result the site has repeatedly crashed			1
initial search efforts concentrated on waters between @entity4 and @entity5 before being extended to the @entity124 and the @entity125			0
users zoom in on each image and drop a pin if they spot anything they believe is related to the crash , such as a wreckage or life raft @entity11 ’s imagery is being uploaded to reflect this search area – although it covers approximately 27,000 square nautical miles ( 92,000 square km ) , meaning there may be a delay			1
to use the site , users zoom in on each satellite image and drop a pin if they spot anything they believe could be related to the crash			1
the system additionally has a tool that will search for and automatically flag any overlapping tags , suggesting more than one person has found something significant in that region			2
all of these tags are analysed by experts and the top ten most likely and significant spots will be shared with the @entity4 authorities			0
@entity11 's @entity159 said that before passing any information over to the authorities , the experts are working on being 100 per cent sure its relevant so not to waste the search teams ’ time or give anyone false hope			1

it remains a mystery how a @entity99 could have disappeared without a trace in such relatively shallow seas @entity5 military personnel prepare a helicopter for a search and rescue mission for the missing @entity92 flight			0

the high - resolution satellite images were *captured* by @entity11
over 25,000 people have already signed up to help search for the plane
the *popularity* of the search has caused the site to repeatedly crash
approximately 1,300 sq miles of imagery has been uploaded onto the site
more images are being added as and when they become available
one user believes he has found what appears to be a underwater wreckage
sighting is now being investigated by experts to confirm its authenticity
