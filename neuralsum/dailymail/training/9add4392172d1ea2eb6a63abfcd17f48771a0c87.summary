@entity2 's @entity1 midfielder @entity0 and agents @entity3 and @entity5 were all allegedly discussed in the text message exchange between @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity10 ’s investigation into allegations of racist , sexist and homophobic texts ended on thursday night with a public apology from @entity7 and the resignation of @entity15 sporting director @entity8			1
the text exchanges outlined in @entity10 ’s exclusive report date back to when @entity7 and @entity8 worked as manager and head of recruitment at @entity2 , before both were sacked by club owner @entity22 amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market			1
the series of deeply offensive text messages were discovered during a raid on @entity8 ’s @entity37 home in march			1
after a meeting his employers at @entity40 , @entity8 resigned on thursday			1
@entity7 issued a poorly worded statement through the @entity42			2
‘ in the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff , it emerged that @entity50 had , it seems , sent a couple of one - line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures , ’ said the statement			2
@entity56 - agent and lawyer what was said : ‘ i hope she ’s looking after your needs			0
i bet you ’d love a bounce on her falsies			0
’ the response : @entity3 was unavailable for comment on thursday			2
victim : agent @entity3 was discussed in text messages allegedly sent on @entity8 's phone @entity72 - @entity71 @entity73 : ‘ go on , fat @entity74 like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers ! ! ! ’ the response : ‘ it was unnecessary			1
agents can be fair game			2
in today ’s society racism is wholly unacceptable and sport should be no different			0
it ’s part of our society and it should set an example			0
‘ i do n’t know if there was any malice but people have to be more aware and more responsible			0
as a @entity76 person - and with what is going on in @entity95 at the moment the @entity76 community is feeling pretty vulnerable - this kind of thing does n’t help			0
we all support anti-racism in sport and now that i have been asked to say something i ’m going to take the opportunity			0
‘ if you want to call me fat , i do n’t care			0
but to say it ’s good to see a @entity76 suffer , that ’s not good			0
‘ i do n’t want to be judgmental because i think they have enough problems but this is n’t just football - it ’s real life - and there is no place for language like that			0
’ unnecessary : agent @entity5 , pictured with @entity117 , said racism is wholly unacceptable in society @entity0 - @entity2 midfielder what was said : ‘ @entity122			1
there ’s enough dogs in @entity2 for us all to go around			2
’ the response : @entity0 's agent @entity127 responded via email			1
' surely , we have checked all reports from the @entity130 regarding the manager @entity7 and his right hand man @entity8 related with our player @entity0			1
' regardless @entity7 had mentioned that kind of @entity134 words by text , we never received any unfair treatments from him and @entity2 at all			1
' when @entity0 firstly joined @entity2 in 2012 summer , just after @entity137 , @entity7 had given a lot of considerations for the player and our staffs			1
' @entity0 could n’t understand @entity142 well at that time , and our staff could be always with the player and support him very well , at all home , away games , locker room and all of team meetings , even it was not allowed to anyone			1
also , @entity7 had spent a lot of times with @entity0 for his adaptation and match performances always			1
' @entity7 has very strong character , as everyone knows , and he could say worst words on the pitch , but it was just a word , and he always has shown warmest hearts and faith to the player and all of our agency staffs as well			2
' this is all what i can tell you about this rumor			0
' international : @entity1 midfielder @entity0 joined @entity2 during the summer of 2012 the @entity42 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity7 ’s time at @entity2			1
in the course of a search by the @entity179 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity7 ’s employment at @entity2 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity50 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity50 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			2
that said , @entity50 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity203 process is complete			2
the @entity42 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity50 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			0
if @entity50 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity50 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity203 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity15			1
@entity50 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			1
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity50 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity50 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity50 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity50 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity203 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter .			2
