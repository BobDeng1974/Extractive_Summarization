by @entity1 reporter published : 23:33 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 23:33 est , 16 december 2013 some people make signs			0
and occasionally people stage sit - ins to express their grievance with a business or government institution			0
but a @entity12 man has gone a very different route : to protest a shortage of subway trains going from @entity16 to @entity12 , @entity17 has made a life - size mold of his entire body , covered it head - to - toe in wrapping paper and left it in one of @entity12 's busiest subway stations			1
@entity17 describes his installation as a ' friendly reminder ' that the population in @entity12 is growing at record pace , and the @entity27 is not meeting the demands of the growing population			2
@entity30 : @entity12 @entity17 is using this life - sized - gift - wrapped - mold of himself to protest a shortage of subway trains ' @entity34 , @entity35 ! here 's a present i am sure you are looking forward to opening			1
add this one to the other 60,000 presents who have moved into the borough in the last 2 years ! best of luck with those extra trains services			0
@entity44 , @entity12 , ' @entity17 wrote on a card attached to the gift - wrapped mold of his body			1
as @entity49 reports , @entity17 also made headlines in the summer of 2012 for a project he did titled @entity52 , a website that predicted the temperature on each platform of the subway 's l train , which runs from lower @entity16 into @entity12			2
' over the past month i have been recording the temperature at the different platforms and the above ground temperature , ' @entity17 said of his project at the time			0
' i came to a fairly accurate system which has allowed me to pull in the localized weather from @entity65 for the different neighborhoods and add a weighting system for the temperature at the platforms			0
reminder : @entity17 left this @entity35 card on the mold , reminding the @entity27 of @entity12 's increasing population ' on the tests that i have been doing it has been accurate to a couple of degrees around 80 % of the time			1
however , like the weather , sometimes there are some things you cant account for that may affect the weather			0
' as for his latest installment , @entity17 should be happy to know that the @entity27 has promised to add more trains to the l line during peak times .			1

@entity17 says his new ' installment ' is to remind *transportation* *officials* that @entity12 's population is growing and there is a shortage of trains on the @entity52 line
in *addition* to the gift - wrapped mold of himself , @entity17 left a @entity35 card *explaining* the population growth in @entity12
the @entity27 has said it plans to increase the number of trains on the @entity52 line during peak times
