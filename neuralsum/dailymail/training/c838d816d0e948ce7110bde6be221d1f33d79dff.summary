by @entity0 and @entity1 rejuvenated chancellor @entity3 is secretly plotting to run for the @entity5 leadership when @entity6 steps down , senior conservatives claimed last night			1
and mr @entity3 ’s allies are reportedly making plans to head off a challenge from the man he sees as his main rival , @entity12			2
the @entity13 has been told that hostilities have broken out between the two camps , the so - called ‘ @entity16 ’ ( @entity17 ) and the ‘ @entity18 ’ ( @entity19 )			0
going head to head : @entity3 is secretly plotting to run for the @entity5 leadership and @entity12 is seen as his biggest rival mr @entity3 ’s @entity17 have accused mr @entity12 ’s @entity19 of making fresh attempts to find a @entity5 mp willing to give up his or her parliamentary seat so that mr @entity12 could make an instant commons comeback if the @entity28 resigned			1
and the @entity19 have accused the @entity17 of lining up education secretary @entity29 as mr @entity3 ’s ‘ running mate ’ and having him undermine mr @entity12 by claiming the @entity32 mayor is ‘ not serious enough ’ to run the country			1
sources close to the chancellor say his ambitions have been revived by the economic recovery			0
and he may soon receive another boost with speculation that the influential @entity41 newspaper will name him @entity42			0
though there is no indication that mr @entity3 would directly challenge mr @entity6 , friends say he is ready to stand as the ‘ heir to @entity47 ’ in either of two scenarios : silver - tongued @entity29 is one of the few willing to take on mr @entity12 in verbal jousts if mr @entity6 loses next year ’s election and is forced to resign as the @entity5 go into opposition			1
or , if mr @entity6 wins and , as many expect , stands down after holding a referendum on @entity55 ’s membership of the @entity56 in 2017			1
when mr @entity3 – at 42 , five years younger than mr @entity6 – performed confidently in the @entity58 last week , the benches behind him were packed with a growing army of conservative backbenchers keen to join the @entity17			2
silver - tongued mr @entity29 is their uncrowned leader , seen as the ideal partner and one of the few willing to take on mr @entity12 in verbal jousts			2
his being the adopted son of a @entity67 fishmonger makes him a foil both to baronet ’s son mr @entity3 and to mr @entity12 , who , like mr @entity6 , was a member of @entity72 ’s notorious and privileged @entity71			1
other members of the @entity17 include deputy chief whip @entity74 , business minister @entity75 and @entity5 mps @entity76 and @entity78			0
another fog said : ‘ @entity3 will never betray @entity6 , but if the economy goes on improving he is the ideal continuity candidate			0
@entity12 and @entity81 are the two who could stop him , and @entity12 is the big danger			0
' we know @entity12 is looking for a seat			0
’ mr @entity12 is believed to have ruled out returning to the @entity58 before next year ’s election			1
he has discussed the possibility of @entity88 mp @entity87 quitting his seat so he can take it over in a by - election			0
but last night , another prominent @entity19 said : ‘ @entity3 effectively controls the @entity91 , which decides when a by - election takes place			0
his people will try to use that to stop @entity12 getting back into the @entity96 quickly so @entity3 can stitch up the leadership			2
‘ but a @entity5 leadership contest without @entity12 will be worse than @entity99 without the prince			1
