most of the 96 animals have been destroyed or exported to @entity2 move kills idea of using cloned animals for food production by @entity7 published : 17:03 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 17:03 est , 6 april 2012 public fears about ‘ @entity10 farming ’ have killed off plans to sell milk from @entity14 ’s only herd of clone cattle			1
most of the 96 animals – sired by two bulls bred from embryos from a cloned cow – have been destroyed or exported to @entity2			1
the farmer who owned the cows decided to get rid of them after it became clear the public would not accept milk or meat from them			2
in effect , the move kills the idea of using cloned animals or their offspring for food production in the @entity14 for the foreseeable future			1
regret : @entity36 is saddened that he has to sell off his herd of cows the @entity39 revealed two years ago that @entity36 had bought the two bulls and bred milking cows from them			2
at that stage , the cows were too young to produce milk , but the news triggered a public backlash amid concerns that clone farming is cruel			2
now it has emerged that mr @entity36 and his family , who run @entity52 near @entity53 in @entity54 , have abandoned plans to produce milk from the cows			0
official records show he has destroyed 42 of the 96 holsteins and exported 31 to @entity60			1
one of these fates awaits the remaining 23.most consumers oppose ‘ clone farming ’ with concerns both for animal welfare and human health , according to research by the @entity67			0
disappointing : official records show mr @entity36 has destroyed 42 of the 96 holsteins and exported 31 to @entity60 leading supermarkets also made it clear they would have nothing to do with any milk produced by the 96 cows			1
when mr @entity36 first bred them , it was unclear whether he would need to get safety approval to sell any milk or meat from them			0
initially , the @entity67 ruled that the food would need to be assessed for safety , but it subsequently changed its mind			1
mr @entity36 said there was never any question that the milk from the cows would be unsafe and insists he was surprised by the negative reaction			0
‘ it was very distressing for me and my family , ’ he said			0
‘ we had taken advice and felt we had followed all the rules and regulations , but we do accept that we had n’t fully appreciated that there would be such a negative reaction			0
‘ what we do regret is that we did n’t anticipate that the level of interest would be so high and , had we done so , we would have done things differently			0
‘ as a farmer , i want to care for my cows and produce food the public want to enjoy			1
’ upset : mr @entity36 said he was working really hard to find a buyer for the remainder of his herd , but had so far been unsuccessful mr @entity36 said the decision to destroy a large number of the cows was ‘ sad and distressing ’			0
he was ‘ working really hard to find a buyer for the remainder , but unfortunately we have so far been unsuccessful ’			0
@entity113 of @entity114 @entity14 , which keeps breed records for milking cows , said no new clone offspring had been born and registered in the @entity14 since the 96 on the @entity54 farm			1
this means only a handful of animals with clone ancestry – fewer than five – are now living on @entity14 farms			1
all of these can be traced back to a single clone cow in the @entity127 ‘ there is no future for cloned farm animals if you look at the public reaction , ’ said mr @entity113			1
he also suggested most farmers had no interest in using clones			0
‘ farmers do not want lots of copies of the same animal for either breeding or food , ’ he said			1
‘ they are constantly looking to improve the animals they have on farms			2
’ the cloned animal that produced the embryos of mr @entity36 ’s bulls was created from cells taken from the ear of a show cow in @entity127 , @entity152 - @entity151			2
there are concerns about the suffering associated with animal cloning , with many cases of miscarriage , early death , gigantism and malformed organs			0
@entity161 , of the campaign group @entity162 , said other farmers and the government should ‘ realise cloning is not the way forward ’			0
he added : ‘ the idea of using clones and their offspring to produce milk and meat is unacceptable to consumers			2

most of the 96 animals have been destroyed or exported to @entity2
