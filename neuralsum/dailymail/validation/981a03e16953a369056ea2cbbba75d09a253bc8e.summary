veteran @entity1 @entity0 is a man on a mission for the remainder of this season , hell - bent on proving his critics wrong by claiming the most unlikely of spots in @entity11 's @entity10 @entity9 squad			1
a combination of impressive form for @entity1 , coupled with an untimely injury for @entity15 8 @entity16 , saw @entity17 recalled for this season 's @entity18 after more than three years in the international wilderness			1
the 36 - year - old 's last international start came in the defeat by @entity24 in the quarter - finals of the @entity26 , and he was subsequently omitted from the @entity10 set - up once @entity28 became coach in early 2012			1
@entity0 poses with @entity30 and @entity31 at the @entity18 but his ability to cover at @entity33 as well as in the second row saw him feature as a replacement for @entity10 against @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity24 in this year 's @entity18 , with the veteran even winning his 50th international cap in the loss in @entity42			1
@entity0 's return to @entity10 colours has been seen by most as simply short - term option as the likes of @entity16 and @entity48 @entity47 battle their way back to full fitness			1
but @entity17 sees his international return very differently and is determined to force his way into @entity28 's @entity9 thinking as he looks to make his mark in the final weeks of the season			2
' it 's going to be tough making the @entity9 squad with @entity16 coming back to full fitness , ' said @entity0 , speaking at the @entity58 @entity57			1
@entity17 looks dejected at the end of the @entity18 match between @entity10 and @entity24 ' but i back myself to make it and i just hope i get a chance in the final @entity9 warm - ups			1
' then the coaches have to make the decision from there about whether to select me or not but i back myself to make it			0
' our chances for the @entity9 are as good as they were before			2
we have always had the players , it is just making sure we turn up for the big games and apply it			0
' i would not mind becoming the oldest scorer for @entity10 at the @entity9 – it would be a really nice thing to add to my career and i 'm now so desperate to get the opportunity – i will be doing everything i can to impress and earn selection			1
' @entity10 came within six points of winning the @entity18 title this season after dismantling @entity24 at @entity85 on the final weekend of the @entity86 , with only an @entity38 hammering of @entity88 meaning @entity17 is not adding yet more silverware to an already impressive cv			1
@entity17 is 36 but hopes to win a place in @entity11 's @entity10 squad a host of @entity10 players sparkled during the tournament , namely @entity96 and @entity97 , but it was the performances of @entity100 @entity99 at the base of the scrum that caught @entity17 's eye			1
in previous campaigns , @entity99 's fitness and inability to last 80 minutes had been called into question by @entity11 and his @entity10 coaching staff			2
but despite the form of @entity110 hampering his international chances , @entity17 is convinced the @entity10 youngster is now the real deal on the international stage			2
' @entity99 has had a very good tournament , ' added @entity17			0
' he has got back to what he does best which is being a wrecking - ball for us , which is generally the job of a @entity120 but he has got more to come from his game i think which can only be exciting for @entity125 rugby			0
' he has got a big @entity10 future ahead of him			0
you look at last year and he was playing around 50 minutes and then being subbed but now this year he 's managed to play five 80 minute games in a row so he is always developing			0
' i 'm still gutted about the end to the @entity18 ; i feel the same as i did after the game			2
we had chances to win it and unfortunately we just came up short – that 's the overriding feeling amongst the players			0
' but there were so many positive as well to take from the tournament ; namely the form , fitness and performances of @entity99 – there are things to build on for us			0
' @entity57 is proud to sponsor the world 's largest schools rugby tournament			0
all @entity57 's rugby sponsorships aim to help develop and grow the sport and ensure even more youngsters get involved with rugby .			0

@entity0 last started a game for @entity10 at the @entity26
@entity17 was part of the @entity18 squad and came off the bench
@entity17 wants to be the oldest player to score a try at the @entity9
