"			1
' afterwards i studied different techniques for cutting paper which helped me to develop my current work			0
' i start by picking the leaves , washing , drying , pressing and cutting - and while they are in the press , i sketch out the drawing , which i attach to the leaf before starting to cut it			0
' at the end , i peel it off which is the hardest part and the most delicate of all because the leaf is fragile and days of work can be ruined in just moments			0
' i have been using this technique for more than four years so i have made and sold many pieces , but i have managed to preserve my first one in a frame			0
