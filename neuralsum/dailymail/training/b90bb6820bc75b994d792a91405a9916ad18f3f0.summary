probes sent to @entity1 usually use a soft landing system that causes them to bounce several times before coming to a standstill			2
but @entity6 needs to be more accurate when it comes to putting humans on the red planet , and it is hoping @entity12 's @entity11 rocket could help			1
the space agency recently teamed up with @entity15 's firm to record thermal footage of the @entity11 rocket as its first stage pulled away and burned through the atmosphere			2
at this point it is discarded from the second stage and returns to @entity33			1
according to @entity6 , its descent back to @entity33 presents @entity1 - like conditions , which means data collected could help plan a future mission to the red planet			1
with an failure rate of 66 per cent , the entry , descent and landing phase of the @entity1 mission is the key part of any mission to the red planet			1
@entity1 ' surface pressure is less than one per cent of @entity33 ’s , which is not enough to slow down an aircraft from its entry speed of more than 12,000mph ( 19,000 km / h )			1
the upgraded @entity11 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions private spaceflight company , @entity12 , successfully launched the first of its newly - improved @entity11 9 rockets in september			0
the nine - engine rocket is its most powerful to date and designed to test the viability of using fully reusable launch vehicles for future missions			2
currently , after delivering their payloads into orbit , booster rockets tumble back toward @entity33 and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea			2
this is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £ 280 million			0
@entity12 , however , is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on @entity33 so that they can be recovered and recycled			0
during september 's launch , three first - stage engines were reignited , to see if they could bring the first - stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact			1
another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water			0
' nestled inside the rocket 's new 17 - foot ( 5 - metre ) diameter nose cone was a small @entity82 science satellite called @entity83 that initially was to fly on @entity12 's now - discontinued @entity84 the most revolutionary thing about the new @entity11 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase , which is almost three - quarters of the cost of the rocket , ' @entity15 added			0
the upgraded @entity11 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions , longer fuel tanks , new avionics and software intended to boost lift capacity and simplify operations for commercial service			0
to record the descent of @entity11 , the agency equipped two planes with infrared cameras and had them film the controlled flight which took place in @entity104 in september			0
on launch day , the planes reached their observation locations about 50 miles ( 80km ) from the projected rocket trajectory			0
video footage from the planes revealed the thermal energy given off by the rocket as it fell to @entity33 at supersonic speeds			1
' because the technologies required to land large payloads on @entity1 are significantly different than those used here on @entity33 , investment in these technologies is critical , ' said @entity119 , principal investigator for @entity120 ( @entity121 )			1
@entity1 ' surface pressure is less than one per cent of @entity33 ’s , which is not enough to slow down an aircraft from its entry speed of more than 12,000mph ( 19,000 km / h ) ' this is the first high - fidelity data set of a rocket system firing into its direction of travel while traveling at supersonic speeds in @entity1 - relevant conditions			1
@entity6 chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to @entity1 is ' necessary if the human race is to survive '			2
the space agency is currently developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to by 2030			1
as well as making the daring 34 - million - mile journey through space , once at @entity1 astronauts will have to contend with the cold , barren landscape of @entity1			0
the planet has violent winds with dust storms that engulf the planet for months at a time			0
it never rains and temperatures drop to -90 ° c at night .			0

footage captured *falcon* 9 rocket as its first stage fell back to @entity33
first stage is the part that is ignited at launch and is later discarded
its descent back to @entity33 presents @entity1 - like conditions , says @entity6
@entity162 will *analyse* data to help understand how to land on @entity1
@entity6 says it is hoping to send humans to the red planet by 2030
