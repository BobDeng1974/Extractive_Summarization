@entity1 star @entity0 has blasted the voting system for the @entity3 and claimed that he was more deserving of the award than winner @entity5 because he won five trophies in 2013 , while the @entity8 star did not win any			1
the @entity9 appeared to accept coming third behind winner @entity5 and second - placed @entity10 at the award ceremony in @entity12 last monday , even claiming that individual awards were not important to him			2
but his frustration appears to have got the better of him since then and he has come out all guns blazing in a powerful interview with @entity17			0
@entity5 , on the other hand , did not win anything			2
i am not sad that i missed out , but it does hurt a bit			0
i deserved to win the @entity3 ' @entity0 claimed the @entity29 title , the @entity31 cup , the @entity32 , the @entity33 and @entity34 with @entity1 during 2013			1
the @entity36 star even appeared to suggest changes were made in this year 's voting system to help @entity5 's cause , by extending the deadline at the same time the @entity42 star had almost single - handedly seen off @entity43 in a @entity34 play - off			1
champion : @entity0 believes his medal haul of five trophies in 2013 should have seen him win the @entity3 all smiles : @entity0 celebrates winning the @entity34 after @entity1 beat @entity49 winner : @entity0 believes @entity5 should n't have won the @entity3 after a trophyless 2013 floating : @entity5 works on his skills in training for @entity8 after bagging the @entity3 ' it was clear that @entity5 would win it			1
the voting deadline was extended by two weeks			2
this had never happened before			0
it was n't about football			0
it was a political decision			0
' his frustrations did n't end there as he also criticised the @entity65 's team of the year - for only having three @entity29 stars in it , despite the 2013 @entity32 final being contested by @entity1 and @entity69			1
glaring omissions : @entity0 believes his @entity1 team - mates @entity72 and @entity73 should have made the 2013 @entity65 ' there are only three @entity1 players in there			1
[ @entity72 ] @entity72 deserves to be there , and so do [ @entity80 ] @entity79 , [ @entity73 ] @entity73 and [ @entity82 ] @entity81			1
' we won five titles and made history			0
and then there 's the absence of @entity69 players			0
where are [ @entity91 ] @entity90 and [ @entity93 ] @entity92 ? this is impossible			0

@entity0 won five trophies with @entity1 in 2013
@entity36 star says he ' deserved ' to win @entity3 but was overlooked
@entity5 was *crowned* world player of the year
@entity0 says voting deadlines were changed to ' help @entity5 '
more @entity29 players should have been in @entity65 team of the year
@entity72 and @entity73 should have been *included*
