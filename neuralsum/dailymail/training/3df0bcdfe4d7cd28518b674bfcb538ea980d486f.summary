by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 3 april 2013 the mother - in - law of @entity3 co-founder @entity2 obviously is n't ready for the company 's futuristic dream of self - driving cars			1
@entity7 appeared to have the fright of her life in one of the autonomous automobiles when she rode in one for the first time around a course specially set up in @entity14 , @entity15			1
' turn it off ! ' she shrieked , as the vehicle accelerated to unsettling speeds around the course atop a multi-storey car park			0
the company 's fleet of a dozen computer - controlled vehicles has since logged more than 300,000 miles of self - driving without an accident , according to @entity3			1
@entity3 's autonomous cars use computers , sensors and other technology to operate independently , but a human driver can override the autopilot function and take control of the vehicle at any time			1
and that 's precisely what the driver of mrs @entity7 's car is forced to do as she starts to freak out during her first go in one of the vehicles			1
no hands ! these grabs show a @entity3 driverless car as it swerves and steers around a course in @entity14 , @entity15 , carrying the company co-founder 's mother - in - law @entity7 prototype : the versions of the @entity3 driverless car featured in the film had keyboards attached			1
it is not known whether the final products will also ship with keyboards her son - in - law has said that he believes the self - driving car ' can really improve the quality of life for everyone '			2
autonomous cars can make roads safer , free commuters from the drudgery of driving , reduce congestion and provide transport to people who ca n't drive themselves , such as the blind , disabled , elderly and intoxicated , he claimed			2
' i expect that self - driving cars will be far safer than human - driven cars , ' he added			2
but mr @entity2 's confidence had not infected mrs @entity7 by the time this video was shot			1
she is just one of three passengers aboard for the unsettling ride , which saw the modified @entity97 reach 40mph			0
cue much nervous laughter and obscene language as the vehicle hurtled around the sets of bollards set up to mark out the sun - soaked course - with its ' driver 's ' hands nowhere near the steering wheel			0
on the market within the decade : @entity3 is just one of a range of manufacturers working on autonomous technology			2
they are collaborating with @entity97 , but their competitors include @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 do n't worry , your mother is safe : @entity2 with his wife @entity36 but , after gathering themselves , the three passengers experiencing what many believe is the future of road transport are eventually ready for more			1
' can we take another spin ? ' one asks			0
another feebly reassures the rest : ' i 've seen a video of other people doing it			0
we 're going to be just fine			0
' the nervous laughter reaches fever pitch this time as the car - with no outside interference - takes hairpin turns at speeds a real driver would be nervous to attempt			0
narrowly missing bollards and planters holding palm trees , it steers around the course to a chorus of expletives			0
and when it finally finishes , the passengers respond with sighs of relief and an exclamation of the highest praise that can be awarded by @entity15 's geek set : ' that rocks			0
