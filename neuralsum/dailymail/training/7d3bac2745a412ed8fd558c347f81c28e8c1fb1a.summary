but still its not something myself that i think looks good on tv			1
' the commenter identified himself as @entity31 , who is a retired white man who lives in the area , and went on to justify his criticism saying that other hairstyles that do n't appeal to people are rarely shown on television			1
' what about letting someone a male have waist long hair do the news.what about that , ' he wrote			1
