the post-mortem examination of poisoned spy @entity2 was ‘ one of the most dangerous ever undertaken in the @entity4 ’ , a pathologist revealed yesterday			1
dr @entity5 said the former @entity7 agent was carried to a secure room in two body bags because of the radiation coming from it			2
taking no chances with safety during the three - hour autopsy , pathologists each wore two biochemical suits , two pairs of gloves and specialised hoods fitted with battery - powered breathing packs to avoid being contaminated by polonium - 210			1
@entity35 pathologist dr @entity5 said paramedics were also on standby because ‘ it would have been a disaster if anyone had fainted or had an acute medical problem ’			2
describing how the @entity41 had put a ‘ casualty evacuation ’ plan in place , he added : ‘ i think it was felt that this was such a dangerous post-mortem to carry out that we really only wanted to do it once if at all possible			0
‘ it has been described as one of the most dangerous post-mortem examinations ever undertaken in the western world , and i think that ’s probably right			0
’ the former spy and critic of @entity56 died from acute radiation poisoning in 2006 after two @entity59 hitmen are said to have laced his tea with polonium - 210 at the @entity61 in @entity62			1
evidence : pathologist @entity5 , left , and detective inspector @entity65 , right , were among those who addressed the inquiry yesterday widow : @entity2 is pictured arriving for the second day of the inquiry dr @entity5 had earlier told the inquiry how the body had presented a ‘ considerable hazard ’ on the intensive unit it was on at @entity73 , @entity74			1
after sealing the room and taking a tissue sample from mr @entity2 ’s right thigh , the body was wrapped in two body bags before being taken to a secure room for examination , he said			1
the @entity25 were told how mr @entity2 had ingested a ‘ large quantity ’ of polonium - 210 and the amount his body absorbed was ‘ in far excess of known survivability limits ’			1
dr @entity5 added : in terms of weight it ’s a very tiny amount , but in terms of polonium - 210 it is a large quantity			1
’ mr @entity2 , 43 , is the first recorded person to have been killed by the highly radioactive chemical – a billionth of a gram of which is fatal and one gram could be enough to kill 100million people			1
the inquiry heard that polonium - 210 emits alpha radiation rather than gamma radiation			1
that means it is only dangerous if it gets inside the body , where it continuously bombards cells as it is distributed around			2
the court was also told how hospital doctors were initially baffled over the cause of mr @entity2 ’s deteriorating condition			2
the alleged murderer of @entity2 , a former @entity7 officer who is now a @entity59 mp , declared last night that he ' could n't care less ' about the inquiry			2
@entity111 was charged with killing mr @entity2 nearly eight years ago , but has never stood trial as he can not be extradited from his native country			0
the @entity59 dissident was apparently poisoned with polonium while meeting @entity111 and businessman @entity116 at the @entity61 in @entity62			2
@entity111 had previously visited @entity74 twice within the previous month - and during one of his trips , mr @entity2 was the target of a botched poisoning attempt			2
after the ex-spy 's death , attention focussed on @entity111 as the principal suspect , and in may 2007 the @entity125 charged him with murder			2
@entity59 authorities refused to extradite him to the @entity128 , saying it would be against their constitution , but offered to put him on trial in his home country			1
@entity111 's deviance of the @entity128 government has made his a cause celebre in @entity59 , and he was elected as an mp in late 2007			1
in 2012 , he passed a televised lie - detector test which supposedly cleared him of mr @entity2 's murder - but critics claim that the device is nothing more than pseudo-science			1
today @entity144 , who represents the dead spy 's widow @entity147 , read out part of an interview that @entity111 gave to @entity150 last night , in which he claimed that the inquiry was politically motivated			1
' when the situation in @entity154 kicked off and the @entity128 's geographical interest had likely begun to change , they had decided to dust off the moth balls and commence proceedings , ' he said			1
he added that he ' could n't care less about what 's happening ' in the inquiry , and claimed that he had not been asked to give evidence			2
@entity111 concluded : ' this is an old story you are rehashing , an old story now			0
' two days before his death medics decided ‘ on a hunch ’ to carry out specific tests which showed up polonium - 210 poisoning			1
another pathologist , dr @entity167 , said diagnosis was difficult because it was the ‘ only case in the world ’			2
‘ it would not have been forefront in the thought process of anyone and would not have been identified in routine toxicology , ’ he said			0
@entity175 , representing the @entity2 family , suggested it would be a good poison for anyone who wanted the cause of death to go undetected			0
he said : ‘ the rarity of polonium - 210 agent makes it so hard to detect			1
he was dying slowly over 23 days			0
it was not until the last day of his life polonium was identified			0
if this poison was administered as a means of murdering it would be very difficult for the cause of death to be identified			0
‘ whoever made that decision [ to use polonium - 210 ] must have had access to a very highly specialised degree of scientific knowledge			1
family : @entity2 pictured with his wife @entity197 ( left ) and son @entity198 in @entity74 in 2000 suspects : @entity116 , left , and @entity111 , right , have been accused of killing mr @entity2 @entity2 's teapot was ' covered with radiation traces ' , leading nuclear scientist tells inquiry the teapot from which @entity2 drank shortly before falling ill had ' off the scale ' levels of radiation traces , the inquiry was heard			1
one of the country 's top nuclear scientists - known only as ' @entity211 ' because of her secret work on the @entity128 's nuclear deterrent - gave evidence to the hearing this afternoon			1
she was shown a 3d model of a teapot taken from the @entity61 where mr @entity2 was allegedly poisoned in november 2006			0
the levels of radiation on the teapot were ' off the scale ' , she said , adding : ' the probe would n't be able to measure any higher			0
meeting : mr @entity2 was apparently poisoned at the @entity61 in @entity62 , pictured ' there was a considerable amount of activity in the spout			0
it is more than probable this is the source of primary contamination			0
there was a form of polonium within the teapot			0
' polonium - 210 was also found in a hotel room occupied by @entity111 , she told the inquiry			1
scientist @entity240 said that the radioactive isotope is not present in nature , and to make a small amout it is necessary to take ' tonnes of material ' and mix it in a nuclear reactor			0
she added that it would be impossible to tell where the substance was made simply by examining its structure			0
the deadly substance could easily be dissolved in liquid and would potentially be invisible to the naked eye , the hearing was told			0
' in solution it often forms a colloid , a very fine distribution within the water matrix , ' scientist @entity240 said			0
' it could be possible to detect it with human eye , you may not be able to			0
if it 's completely soluble you wo n't be able to see it			0
' she said that the substance could be transported in a glass tube without any risk of alpha particles escaping .			0

pathologist tells public inquiry the dead spy 's body was highly radioactive
doctors had to wear *protective* clothing while carrying out the examination
it is the first recorded case of polonium - 210 being used to poison someone
former spy fled to the @entity128 after falling out with *president* @entity56
