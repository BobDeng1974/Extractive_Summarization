by @entity0 published : 18:51 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 22 january 2013 an emotional @entity1 was close to tears when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with @entity8 last night			1
speaking about his 13 - year - old son @entity9 , the oldest of his five children , @entity1 said : ‘ i saw my son defending me and saying , “ that 's not true			1
what you 're saying about my dad is not true , ' " @entity1 recalled			1
‘ that 's when i knew i had to tell him			2
’ the disgraced cyclist battled to fight back tears as he talked about son @entity9 @entity1 told @entity8 that he believes he deserves to be given the opportunity to compete again critics said @entity1 had n't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview , but on friday night he seemed to lose his composure when @entity8 zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life			1
‘ what did you say ? ’ @entity8 asked			1
‘ i said , " listen , there 's been a lot of questions about your dad			0
whether i doped or did not dope			0
i 've always denied that and i 've always been ruthless and defiant about that			0
you guys have seen that			0
that 's probably why you trusted me on it			0
" which makes it even sicker , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ and uh , i told @entity9 , i said , ’ and here @entity1 paused for a long time to collect himself , ‘ i said , " do n't defend me anymore			1
' " ' if anyone says anything to you , do not defend me			2
just say my dad said he was sorry '			0
' he said " look , i love you , you 're my dad , this wo n't change that "			0
' thank @entity53 he 's more like @entity54 ( @entity1 's first wife and @entity9 's mother )			1
' @entity1 also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons			1
@entity1 seemed to lose his composure when @entity8 zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life four of @entity1 's children stand next to his team bus in 2010 , his two twin daughters @entity64 and @entity65 , @entity9 ( blue t - shirt ) and @entity67 ( black t - shirt ) @entity8 also drew @entity1 out on his ex-wife , @entity54 , whom he claimed knew just enough about both the doping and lying to ask him to stop			1
he credited her with making him promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug - free			2
' she said to me , " you can do it under one condition : that you never cross that line again , ' " @entity1 recalled			2
' the line of drugs ? ' @entity8 asked			2
and i said , " you 've got a deal , ' " he replied			0
' and i never would have betrayed that with her			0
' @entity1 also told @entity8 that he believes he should be given the opportunity to compete again , saying : ' i deserve to be punished			1
i 'm not sure that i deserve a death penalty			1
' @entity1 was competing in triathlons , mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future , suggesting a life ban is not right			1
he told @entity8 in the second part of their television interview : ' i ca n't lie to you			1
i 'd love the opportunity to be able to compete , but that is n't the reason that i 'm doing this			1
' frankly , this might not be the most popular answer , but i think i deserve it ( to be able to compete again )			2
' @entity1 said his lowest moment was having to cut ties with his charity which he described as like a ' sixth child ' to him @entity1 , pictured in 2005 with three of his children , was most emotional when he talked about the impact of his actions on them @entity1 's infamous tweet photo , he admitted that he thought it had been a good idea at the time in hindsight @entity1 says he wishes he had co-operated with the @entity115 investigation which proved his downfall			1
co-operation could have meant a lesser penalty			0
@entity1 's long - time sponsors including @entity120 and @entity121 deserted him in quick succession following the publication of the @entity115 report , something he described as a ' $ 75 - million dollar day			1
' the @entity127 insisted @entity1 did not receive a fee for the interview and was not offered one			2
yet money is a concern after his sponsors departed			0
his admission has exposed him to numerous lawsuits , too			0
' i 've lost all future income , ' he said			0
' i do n't like thinking about it , but that was a $ 75 million day			1
and probably never coming back			0
' however he said his most challenging moment was when his own @entity142 , the charity known now as @entity142 , distanced itself from him			1
' the foundation is like my sixth child and to make that decision , and to step aside , was big , ' said @entity1 , who expressed his wish the charity can thrive without being associated with him			1
' i would n't at all say [ i was ] forced out , told to leave			2
i was aware of the pressure			0
' it was the best thing for our organization , but it hurt like hell			0
that was the lowest [ moment ]			2
' asked if he feels disgraced , @entity1 said : " of course , but i also feel humbled			2
' @entity1 admitted he felt disgraced , humbled and ashamed by his actions @entity1 ended the interview by admitting he had betrayed the people who ' supported me and believed in me ' @entity8 also quizzed him about the photo he tweeted last november in which he was surrounded by his seven tainted @entity160 winning yellow jerseys			1
the infamous photo was tweeted by @entity1 , along with the message : ' back in @entity164 and just layin ' around ... ' not long after he was stripped off his seven titles by @entity115 ( @entity115 ) for using performance - enhancing drugs			1
‘ was it just you being your cocky arrogant self ? ’ asked @entity8			2
@entity1 admitted that it had been an act of defiance			2
' and you know what 's scary i actually thought it was a good idea at the time			0
' @entity1 also denied claims he attempted to make a payment to @entity115			2
he said : ' i had no knowledge of that , but i 've asked around			0
i think the claim was 250,000 dollars			0
that 's a lot of money			0
' @entity1 says he returned to cycling in 2009 and 2010 having agreed not to use performance - enhancing drugs again , yet evidence in the @entity115 report points to the contrary			1
he maintains the last time he doped was during his 2005 @entity160 win			0
@entity8 asked @entity1 ' did anyone know the whole truth ? ' he replied ' yeah , ' but there was no follow - up to ascertain who			1
so was there a moral to his story ? ' i can look at what i did , ' he said			0
' cheating to win bike races , lying about it , bullying people			0
of course , you 're not supposed to do those things			0
that 's what we teach our children			0
' @entity1 paused to compose himself before a final mea culpa			2
' i just think it was about the ride and losing myself , getting caught up in that , and doing all those things along the way that enabled that , ' he said			0
' the ultimate crime is , uh , is the betrayal of those people that supported me and believed in me			0
' they got lied to			0
' thursday night 's interview had been the first time that @entity1 had publicly confessed to doping			1
@entity224 knew : the singer was previously silent over former fiance 's doping scandal one question that was n't answered is how much former fiancée @entity229 knew about @entity1 's use of performance - enhancing drugs ? @entity229 , 50 , started dating @entity1 in 2003 , before getting engaged in 2005 and splitting the following year			1
the @entity233 singer was with @entity1 , 41 , during the time that he won two of his @entity160 victories			2
in september last year @entity229 told @entity237 how she found it difficult watching her former fiance stripped of his titles			1
she said : ' i felt bad			0
i felt bad for him , i felt bad for his family and i kinda felt like the rest of @entity233 ... he is a hero that we watched and looked up to and admired			0
' @entity229 is yet to pass comment on @entity1 's admissions on national television			1
the @entity249 reported that she was interviewed by federal agents in late 2011 , before he was stripped of his titles for using and distributing performance - enhancing drugs the following year			0
meanwhile the @entity253 spoke to two separate sources who claimed @entity229 knew a lot about the doping scandal			1
support : @entity1 , seen here at the @entity258 with @entity229 and his three children from his first marriage			1

' i deserve to be punished . i 'm not sure that i deserve a death penalty '
described his sponsors dropping him as ' a $ 75 - million dollar day '
