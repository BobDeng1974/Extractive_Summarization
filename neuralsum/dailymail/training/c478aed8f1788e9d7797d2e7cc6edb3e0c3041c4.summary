by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:05 am on 28th february 2012 backing : @entity2 addresses the @entity3 today before politicians backed the @entity6 bailout package the @entity8 parliament today approved the £ 108billion @entity6 bailout package despite fierce public opposition			1
chancellor @entity2 said it would be irresponsible to abandon the country to bankruptcy			2
the @entity3 voted 496 to 90 in favour of the new package - despite 80 per cent of @entity8 being opposed to the rescue			1
the result of the vote was never in doubt as two opposition parties backed the measures			2
the bailout is @entity6 's second in less than two years and @entity2 told lawmakers before the vote that ' no one can give a 100 per cent guarantee ' that the programme would be a success			1
she said : ' the road that lies in front of @entity6 is long and truly not without risk			0
' the world ’s 20 leading economies , the @entity32 , at the weekend demanded @entity8 drop its opposition to a bigger @entity36 bailout fund , telling @entity36 it must put up extra money if it wanted more help from other countries			1
one member of @entity2 ’s cabinet , interior minister @entity40 , has openly called on @entity6 to leave the eur zone , saying its chances of recovery would be greater outside			0
' quite clearly the mood in @entity8 is turning against further rescues for @entity6 , ' he said yesterday			1
' but that ’s not surprising			0
this is all deja vu for the public			0
we ’ve been promised all kinds of things that are n’t fulfilled and then a few months later there ’s the need for another rescue package			1
the public ’s faith is fading fast			0
' hours before today 's crunch vote @entity8 's biggest newspaper urged politicians to reject the proposals			1
@entity64 , the @entity8 tabloid , ran with the frontpage headline ' stop ! ' after a weekend poll showed the public firmly opposed the bailout			1
@entity8 is desperate to keep the euro project alive at all costs - but the public are opposed to the size of the rescue package			1
backing : the @entity3 today voted overwhelmingly in favour of the rescue package despite fierce public opposition while chancellor @entity2 speaks of the need for solidarity with @entity78 , @entity64 has become the voice of a long suffering people bitter and frustrated at their taxes underwriting @entity6			1
the paper said today : ' enough is enough			0
' @entity64 appeals to all mps – do n’t go down this crazy path any longer			0
' the paper went on to print the opinions of ten leading economic experts who agree with them			0
one of them , professor @entity92 , of the @entity93 , said : ' this latest aid package solves nothing and will only serve to increase @entity6 misery			2
' the exit of @entity6 from the eurozone should no longer be a taboo subject			0
' mood : protesters gather outside the @entity3 in @entity102 to demonstrate against the rescue package now it longer seems it is			1
@entity40 , the government interior minster , also questioned the value of @entity6 remaining a euro partner – to the anger of mrs @entity2			0
he said that @entity6 should be allowed to leave - the first time a member of the @entity8 government has openly called for such a radical step			1
' @entity6 's chances to regenerate itself and become competitive are surely greater outside the monetary union than if it remains in the euro area , ' @entity40 told news magazine @entity116			0
' i 'm not talking about throwing @entity6 out , but rather about creating incentives for an exit that they ca n't pass up			0
' @entity121 , the ruling @entity122 's budgetary policy spokesman in the @entity3 , also expressed skepticism about whether the expectations reflected in the rescue package are realistic , even though he supports the deal in general			1
' i have some doubts about whether the package 's stated goal of reducing @entity6 's debt to 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by the year 2020 can be achieved , ' he said			2
@entity132 ! @entity8 's biggest newspaper @entity64 urged politicians to vote against a second bailout for @entity6 meanwhile uncertainty over @entity6 's position within the @entity137 has continued to stifle market expectations			1
@entity8 's @entity139 and @entity141 's @entity140 were both down more than 1 per cent following falls on @entity144 markets overnight			2
@entity145 of @entity146 said the @entity32 meeting over the weekend had disappointed investors			0
' the non-european members of the @entity32 said to the @entity36 members in no uncertain terms , put up or shut up			0
' we still have the political stalemate in @entity36 whereby @entity8 ’s current leader will not get its bazooka out for fear of giving up further political ground to her opponents when she is already reliant on a coalition to pass votes on @entity36 bailouts			2
' by giving in and saying that @entity8 will stump up could easily cost @entity2 the next @entity8 election in the autumn of next year			2
' but other nations around the world will simply not inject any more funds into the @entity167 in order to prop up the eurozone when large parts of the region remain woefully uncompetitive and profligate			0
