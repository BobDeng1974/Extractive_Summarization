sixes and fours ? : mrs justice @entity3 , sitting in @entity2 , has been a high court judge since 2011 a planning battle over an old village forge next to a cricket pitch yesterday led to a high court judge asking : ‘ what are sixes and fours ? ’ @entity12 and @entity13 is challenging @entity15 ’s decision to grant planning permission for an extension with a residential first floor over the single - storey former blacksmith ’s workshop			1
@entity21 , appearing for the association , said that one of the grounds of objection to the development was that the forge was very close to the square on which cricket is played			1
he told mrs justice @entity3 ‘ sixes and fours are frequently hit by batsmen on to forge land , including the roof of the building itself ’			1
however , the baffled 59 - year - old judge , sitting at @entity2 ’s @entity36 , said : ‘ i do n’t play cricket - what does that mean ? ’ mr @entity21 replied that sixes were scored in cricket when the ball was hit over the boundary without hitting the ground , while fours ‘ bounced along the ground ’ before crossing the boundary line			1
he added that six runs or four runs were scored automatically without the batsman having to run the runs			0
mrs @entity49 made no further comment on the game and the court turned to consider the dimensions of the controversial development in @entity12 , in the @entity55			1
the judge was educated at @entity57 and @entity58 , @entity59 , where she is an honorary fellow			2
she has been a high court judge since 2011			0
dispute : @entity12 and @entity13 is challenging a decision to grant planning permission for an extension with a residential first floor over the single - storey former blacksmith ’s workshop chairman of @entity12 and @entity13 ( @entity69 ) @entity68 said : ‘ there are a large number of people in @entity12 who have a great attachment to the old forge as an important part of the village ’s heritage and feel that the proposed development is a gross over-development on this tiny site and is out of keeping with the surrounding properties in this conservation area			1
‘ it will cause even greater traffic problems on this narrow and blind bend in the road and will threaten the playing of cricket and other sport on the adjoining cricket ground			0
’ mr @entity21 told the judge that the brick - built forge with its tiled roof dated back to 1869 and was on @entity95 's list of ‘ treasures ’ , which meant its destruction would be a serious loss to the heritage of the county			1
in 2009 @entity101 considered that , while it did not fulfil the criteria for listing for preservation , it was of local importance and should be protected			0
mr @entity21 said the planning permission under challenge was granted to the current owners of the forge in april , and was the third application to be made for the site			1
aerial view : the court heard that one of the grounds of objection to the development was that the forge ( circled ) was very close to the square on which cricket is played he said the first application was subsequently withdrawn			1
the second was granted in september 2013 for a large extension with a residential first floor over the old blacksmith 's workshop			2
the proposal raised concerns and was quashed by consent			0
the third , very similar application was then made and approved by the local planning authority			0
mr @entity21 argued that the proposal was contrary to relevant planning policy			0
the cricket club , ‘ an important village institution ’ composed almost entirely of village residents , was also extremely concerned that it could jeopardise the long - term use of the cricket ground			2
the forge was at the entrance to the ground and very close to the square on which the wickets were pitched			1
as a result sixes and fours were frequently hit on to the forge land , including the roof of the building itself			1
mr @entity21 argued that this was not a concern while the building remained undeveloped			0
education : the judge attended @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 , @entity59 ( right ) , where she is an honorary fellow but there would be potential for damage and injury to people if an additional storey for residential use were to be built with windows overlooking the ground , as well as roof - lights and an open decked area			2
he contended the future of the cricket club would come under threat as it would be liable for any damage to the building and its occupants caused by batsmen hitting balls over the boundary			2
@entity174 , appearing for the district council , said the legal challenge should be dismissed			0
he told the judge the council had granted planning permission for alterations to the forge on behalf of the @entity181			1
he said the forge 's lawful use was as an industrial building , but it was not in use and was in poor condition			2
in essence the approved plan was to secure its future by repairing it and bringing it back into use , with living accommodation on the new first floor			0
steps had been taken to address the cricket club 's concerns , said mr @entity199			0
advice from @entity201 had led to an acceptable scheme of conditions to deal with those concerns			0
the case continues today .			0

@entity12 and @entity13 group is challenging council move
@entity15 has granted permission for an extension
but association says forge is close to square on which cricket is played
judge told ' sixes and fours are frequently hit onto forge land and building '
justice @entity3 replies : ' i do n’t play cricket - what does that mean ? '
