this is the horrifying moment a father accidentally shot a firework into a trampoline where his daughter was playing			1
@entity5 , 40 , of @entity6 on @entity7 , looked on in horror as the rocket fired directly into the enclosed trampoline - turning a playful bouncing session into a scene of sheer panic			1
@entity15 footage captured sparks spraying around the netting as mr @entity5 's daughter @entity18 , nine , and a family friend 's brother , ten , desperately try to escape			1
' luckily , nobody got hurt , but it was certainly a fright , fireworks can be very dangerous even if they are set off correctly			0
' we were very lucky , the children could have suffered some very nasty burns			2
' someone was looking down on us all that night and i wo n't be doing any more fireworks any time soon			2
' calm : the two children are seen happily bouncing on the trampoline in @entity15 footage before disaster strikes after attending an organised fireworks display locally , the @entity5 family had continued the party back at their home , buying Â£ 50 worth of rockets			1
mr @entity5 's other daughter , @entity52 , 21 , a health carer , said : ' we were all in the garden			1
my dad and my friend 's boyfriend set up the fireworks outside of the front gate and on a grassy area nearby			1
' my dad put the kids on the trampoline , as it 's the well away from the house and what he thought would be the safest place			2
' the rocket that went wrong was the last one , my dad lit it and we all watched as it flew off the wrong way , then bounced off the wall of our house and landed onto the trampoline			1
' @entity18 and the other boy who were playing on the trampoline tried to run and get off but @entity18 fell and got her leg stuck in the netting			0
luckily they both managed to get out without getting burnt			0
' it was very scary as all the kids were in the garden and we had no idea where the firework would land			0
' @entity18 was shaking and very scared during the whole night but she 's fine now , i do n't think she 'll feel the same around fireworks in the future though			1
' alert : after @entity5 lets off the firework , smoke fills the area and a child standing in the garden falls to the ground terrifying : sparks fly around the netted enclosure while the two children desperately try to avoid being burnt mr @entity5 , who suffered a serious injury to his hands 15 years ago in another firework - based accident , thinks people should learn from his mistakes and take more care with fireworks in general			1
he added : ' please do n't buy any fireworks online or from @entity107			0
only buy them from a shop who has a licence to sell them			0
' ' yes , the whole incident has put me off fireworks for a while			0
next year , i 'm not even going to buy a pack of sparklers			2
' mr @entity5 has stressed that he had lit the firework according to the instructions on the packet and that it flew off in the wrong direction			1
he added : ' i did everything i was supposed to do			0
the firework was pointing away from the house when i lit it , but it shot off in the wrong direction			2
' it hit the side of the house and bounced into the trampoline			0
' i do n't want to be portrayed as an irresponsible father because that is simply not the case			0

@entity15 shows intense sparks turning scene of fun into sheer chaos
mr @entity5 's daughter , 9 , and family friend *amazingly* escaped unscathed
