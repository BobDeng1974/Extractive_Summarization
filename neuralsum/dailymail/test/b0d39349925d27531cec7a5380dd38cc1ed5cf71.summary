but others point to @entity4 's most notorious @entity1 , paedophile pop star @entity50 , who was jailed for 16 years for a string of sex attacks on girls , as the reason behind the name 's fall from grace			1

above , @entity71 with her brothers and father last month girls @entity120 may be the first letter in the @entity123 alphabet , but it ’s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls			2
not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the @entity24 , when @entity120 was @entity129 301			0
it dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good			2
@entity132 @entity131 made her unusually - spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at @entity129 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971			2
@entity135 , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the @entity137 , but @entity131 is about to vanish			2
@entity138 - this feminization of the ancient roman name @entity141 ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer @entity145 , only to fall off the charts in 1975			1
@entity138 along with most other once - popular – ine and – een - ending girls ’ names are now out of favor			1
@entity151 ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956			1

@entity160 ’s exotic sister @entity159 ranked in the @entity137 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939			2
but the devastating @entity163 took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013			2
@entity169 was never ranked in the @entity137 , but this ancient mythological name – she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired @entity172 – is about to vanish from the modern lexicon			2
@entity174 nearly broke the @entity175 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955			2
@entity177 , @entity178 , and even @entity179 , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but @entity174 is about to lose her grip on modern usage			0
boys @entity191 over a century ago , this short form of @entity187 , the @entity189 form of @entity190 , stood at a respectable @entity192 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view			0
any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from @entity199			0
@entity201 - a dramatic @entity123 mythological name , @entity201 is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences			0
his name has never broken into the national @entity137 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name			0
@entity209 is another name that ’s never ranked here , though it ’s admired enough on @entity211 to make it number 261			2
it ’s the medieval @entity214 version of @entity215 , which has ranked as high as @entity216 on the national list and was used by @entity218 , but @entity219 is a no - go			0
@entity220 - a common name in @entity222 , with the distinctive @entity222 double - l beginning , @entity220 appeared on the @entity24 list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s			0
but despite its rich @entity222 history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , @entity225 seems headed for extinction			0
@entity231 - with his twin brother @entity230 , he was a legendary founder of @entity232			0
but the stereotypical image of @entity231 , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the @entity137			0
@entity235 - the stiff surname @entity235 , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist @entity238 , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , @entity238 ’s heyday , but it has n’t been heard from in the 7 + decades since then			0
@entity242 ? he ’s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year			0
@entity242 actually reached as high as @entity245 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .			0
