by @entity0 he helped bring reversing vehicle alarms to the world			2
but now @entity4 - @entity3 says so many people now find the sounds they make ' annoying ' that he hopes to replace them with a less abrasive noise			1
' @entity10 - people hate the sound of them , ' admitted mr @entity3 , chairman and founder of @entity13 , who gave up his career in shipping in 1976 to concentrate on the devices after spotting a lorry in @entity18 with a rudimentary reversing alarm			1
inventor @entity4 - @entity3 says people find the sounds vehicles make when they reverse ' annoying ' - and has said he hopes to replace them with a less abrasive noise the alarms began to become widespread in the 1980s and have helped save lives thanks to their ear - piercing ' beeps '			1
but there have been mounting complaints about them			0
in 2012 , there was even a reversing alarm flashpoint in @entity32 , @entity33 , with residents at loggerheads with a local supermarket			0
one commentator told the @entity38 : ' [ the residents ] have to go work and they are being woken up early and then ca n't get back to sleep			0
' they go to work tired , they come home tired and then it happens all over again			0
it is horrendous for them			0
' yesterday mr @entity3 told the @entity44 : ' the sound tonal alarms make is very annoying ' , but added that has always been part of the point as they are meant to be heard and not ignored			1
but he said complaints about them and a growing awareness of noise pollution in general , has got him thinking about alternatives			0
he hopes the beeps will one day be replaced with single tones with ' broadband ' sound , which resembles the crash of an ocean wave , albeit in short , staccato bursts			2
' it sounds a lot nicer , ' said mr @entity3			1
he developed the quote broadband sound in 1999 and since then around 3 million supermarket lorries have switched to it			1
he said : ' there are still an estimated 6 million vehicles to be changed ' .			2

@entity4 - @entity3 developed the sound in the late 1970s
alarms became widespread in the 1980s and have saved *countless* lives
inventor says alarms need to be changed as people find them annoying
