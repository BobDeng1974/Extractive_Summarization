by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 04:32 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:01 est , 18 february 2014 dangling from a wooden frame , a live but unconscious pig is shot by a soldier to inflict terrible wounds			1
the stricken animal , still breathing , is then untied so military medics can operate on it and learn how to treat traumatic battlefield injuries			1
the shocking photos – never seen before – were taken in @entity12 during a series of experiments which are attended by surgeons serving in @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
the animals are first strung up the medical professionals are sent to @entity12 to operate on the live animal - which has been strung up and shot by trained marksmen - while it is still breathing the animals are taken by stretcher into operating theatres where the surgeons treat their wounds in a simulation of how injured soldiers are cared for the @entity39 has admitted that live pigs are also blown up by explosives at the @entity42 course held at @entity45 ’s @entity44 training area , 30 miles from @entity46			1
military chiefs have defended the exercises , saying they had ‘ saved many lives ’ in @entity50 and @entity51			0
the courses have led to huge improvements in the treatment of soldiers injured by bullets and roadside bombs			0
but animal welfare activists have demanded an end to the ‘ brutal ’ practice			0
pigs are then treated the same as a human casualty would be - with medics rushing to their side and using dressings to stem blood loss they are then taken to the waiting teams of surgeons			2
it is believed that even if the operation is a success , the animals are later destroyed the photographs of pigs being shot with an @entity78 assault rifle or a 9mm handgun were obtained by campaign group @entity80 @entity17 ( @entity80 )			1
they were published as @entity12 was at the centre of another animal cruelty row , after the controversial killing of a healthy giraffe at @entity86			2
@entity87 , @entity80 associate director , said it was ‘ shameful ’ the @entity17 military were taking part in the twice - yearly training courses that are nicknamed @entity92 said : ‘ the exercises are impossible to justify medically , ethically or educationally			2
’ campaigners claim that hi - tech human simulators – such as the state - of - the - art @entity96 , which ‘ breathes and bleeds ’ – should be used instead of animals			2
during the @entity12 experiments , sedatives are first mixed into the pigs ’ food			2
when they fall asleep they are anaesthetised by a vet			0
the @entity42 course ( @entity42 ) took place at @entity45 's @entity111 training area 30 miles north - west of the @entity12 capital @entity46 pigs are used in the exercise so surgeons can learn how to treat battle wounds , because they are genetically very close to humans @entity119 hospital , in @entity120 , @entity50			1
the @entity39 has defended sending medical staff for the animal training , saying simulators are used where possible to train for real - life situations as above			1
the animals – from a breed which has similar skin to humans – are then taken to a shooting range , where marksmen try to ensure that their shots injure but do not kill			0
the pigs are then placed on a stretcher – just as a human casualty would be – while medics use dressings to stem blood loss before a waiting team of surgeons operates			0
even if the operation is a success , the animals are later destroyed			0
the use of animals in military experiments in the @entity17 is not illegal , but to carry out similar training approval would need to be obtained from the @entity148 on a case - by - case basis			1
an @entity39 spokesman said : ‘ the research we undertake saves lives by helping us develop world - class protective equipment and new medical treatments that benefit both troops and civilians			0
‘ advances in technology mean we are reducing the number of procedures carried out on pigs but there is some research , such as countering the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons , that can not be conducted without the use of animals			0

medical professionals are sent to @entity12 to operate on the live animals
animals are strung up and shot by trained marksmen then taken to theatre
the surgeons cut open and operate on the animal while it is still breathing
surgeons learn vital life - saving techniques which have helped @entity17 forces
