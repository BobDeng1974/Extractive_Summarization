the @entity6 international has yet to score in the @entity8 since his Â£ 16million summer move from @entity10 with his two goals coming against @entity13 minnows @entity14 and @entity15 in the @entity16			1
there is added pressure on the 24 - year - old in the continued absence of @entity21 , who has not played for his club since august 31 because of injury and was this week ruled out until 2015 by a new thigh problem			2
@entity0 has insisted that critics do not concern him despite yet scoring in @entity8 for @entity1 @entity0 greets a group of young @entity28 fans with a smile at @entity30 on thursday but @entity0 stressed his approval rating outside his inner circle is not something which concerns him			1

' the important people for me are my family and my few close friends			0
' criticism of @entity0 has centred not only around his lack of goals but the apparent unwillingness to put in the effort on the pitch			1
however , the striker insists he is working harder than ever before and rated his overall performance as 7/10 - a half - point increase on the assessment of himself two years ago			2
' i run more than before , ' he added			0
' i 've never run like this ... so i give a half point more			0
' goals , they will come			2
it is something that 's just not coming at the moment			0
' the @entity58 forward has struggled since his switch back to the @entity8 from @entity10 @entity0 shown tussling with @entity61 defender @entity60 ( right ) during the 0 - 0 draw at @entity63 last month @entity21 's latest injury , which has prompted a full - scale medical investigation into his recurring problems given he has missed 30 of 82 matches since arriving from @entity68 in january 2013 , has dealt a significant setback to @entity1 as they look to get their season back on track after slipping to 11th in the table			1
he was expected to return this weekend at @entity73 but manager @entity74 must now find a way of getting goals out of @entity0 , fellow summer signing @entity77 and @entity79 - who between them have failed to score in 998 minutes in the @entity8 this season			1

' he is devastated , at a really low point really because he was looking forward to getting back playing			0
' he felt good so it is disappointing for us as a team and him personally			0
