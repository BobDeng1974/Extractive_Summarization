a rising number of pregnant women in @entity2 are choosing to give birth via caesarean section to prevent permanent changes to their sex lives			1
the @entity9 country 's @entity7 is launching a crackdown on the so - called ' c - section epidemic ' after new figures revealed 52 per cent of births are @entity14			1
the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) figures reveal 84 per cent of these deliveries take place in private hospitals , and are funded by health insurance policies			2
in state hospitals , 40 per cent of deliveries are via c - section			1
figures from @entity2 's @entity16 reveal 52 per cent of births are via caesarean section - almost four times the rate recommended by the @entity28 ( file picture ) the @entity28 recommends c - section delivery rates are no higher than 10 to 15 per cent of all deliveries			1
as with all surgery , c - sections carry a certain level of risk - the wound could become infected and the baby could develop breathing difficulties , for example			0
the rise in c - sections is being driven by womens ' concerns over their sex lives post delivery , and unscrupulous doctors promoting the procedure to earn more in health insurance cases , experts said			1
@entity50 , director of the @entity2 federation of @entity52 , told @entity2 newspaper @entity54 : ' the @entity2 woman is concerned with her sexuality and fears that giving birth will alter the perineum [ the area between the vagina and the anus ] , which is a myth			2
' in the @entity65 , just over 32 per cent of all births are @entity14 , according to the @entity66			0
@entity67 , @entity2 's minister of health , called the country 's obsession with c - sections a ' public health problem '			1
he said : ' the epidemic of @entity14 we see today in this country is unacceptable and there is no other way to treat it than as a public health problem			2
' what 's normal are normal births			0
' mr @entity67 added : ' we can not accept c - sections performed on the basis of economic power or convenience			0
' there is no justification ( whether ) financial , technical or scientific , that you can ( argue for the ) high rate of caesarean sections in health insurance			2
experts in @entity2 said women are becoming increasingly concerned about their sex lives after giving birth , which is causing them to opt for c - sections ( @entity97 is pictured ) ' we have to reverse this situation that has developed in the country			1
the @entity14 epidemic today is unacceptable and there is no way to treat it merely as a public health problem			0
' in a bid to crackdown on doctors promoting the procedures to line their own pockets , health bosses now require all medics to inform the government of prenatal information on all births			1
and they will now no longer be able to book elective c - sections , only choosing the delivery method after a woman has gone into labour			0
doctors will also be obliged to give patients information of the risks of performing c - sections , @entity118 reports			0
under the requirements mr @entity67 announced , health insurance companies will have to provide patients with information about the percentage of @entity14 performed by individual doctors and hospitals			0
failure to do so within 15 days will result in large fines			0
the new rules , which take force in six months , will affect the nearly 24 million @entity2 women who have private health plans that cover obstetric services .			2
