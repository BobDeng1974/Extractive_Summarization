you might think finding six double - yolk eggs in one box is about as likely as discovering a unicorn munching through a field of four - leaf clovers			1
however , @entity6 has cut the odds to the point where it is a certainty			2
the chain is launching boxes of six extra-large eggs with every one guaranteed to have two golden , gooey yolks – a product @entity6 says is ‘ perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit ’			1
consequently , the equation for finding six would theoretically be 1,000 to the power of six , which equates to an @entity38 quintillion – 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ( 18 zeros )			0
farmers at @entity6 have managed to take the luck out of the equation by opting for young chickens , whose first eggs are much more likely to produce double yolks			2
any particularly large eggs from these birds are likely to have multiple yolks , so choosing out the double - yolkers becomes easier			1
finally , the eggs are then passed by hand in front of a strong light to check for the double yolk			2
the @entity34 said double - yolkers almost always come from hens about 20 to 28 weeks old , whose hormone systems are not fully developed yet			1
normally the chances of finding a double - yolker like this one in a box of six eggs is just one in 1,000 a spokesman said : ‘ in reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong			1
' you get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more than one egg yolk			0
it forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather large egg with two egg yolks in it			0
’ the yolk is the tastiest and most nutritious part of the egg , because it contains high quality essential fats , vitamins and minerals , including @entity84 , @entity85 , a , @entity86 , @entity87 and folate			0
it is also one of the few foods to naturally contain vitamin d , which is important for bones , particularly in children			0
@entity95 also contain most of the egg ’s calcium , magnesium , potassium , sodium , selenium and iron			0
the @entity105 free range double - yolkers , which are extra-large , are available from this weekend for £ 2.75 for a box of six , compared with a box of the store ’s normal large free range eggs , which costs £ 2 .			1
