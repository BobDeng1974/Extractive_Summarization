@entity0 will probably know by now that they called it wrong			1
they were on trial as much as @entity3 when one of @entity6 ’s most hyped young talents turned up in @entity7 as a 14 - year - old for the first of two visits			1
it might just sting @entity12 on sunday that neither side quite fancied the other , @entity0 thinking the boy ‘ too weak ’ , to quote the player ’s father , and @entity3 himself ruling that the club ’s academy set - up was not as embracing or enticing as that offered by @entity21			1
what an intriguing quirk of fate that scrawny @entity3 grew into a player more than capable of dictating how this @entity26 final will be won			1
@entity3 was one of @entity28 's few bright performers in their @entity30 defeat by @entity31 the @entity33 international has revealed he was rejected by @entity0 as a 14 - year - old trialist @entity3 eventually chose to join the youth academy at @entity21 before going on to star for the first team the @entity38 will have an important part to play when @entity28 face @entity0 in sunday 's @entity26 final ‘ @entity47 was not my first choice at that age , ’ @entity3 admitted this week , recalling the trips from @entity42 to @entity43 , first at 14 and then 15 for games against @entity45 and @entity46			1
‘ i enjoyed myself but it was too big a step at that time			2
in @entity47 you ca n’t enter the training ground without permission whereas in @entity33 you are free to go in			1
@entity21 was a lot closer to home and it meant my mum could come over for my first month			2
it was an easy decision			2
’ he signed for @entity21 at 16 and joined @entity28 as an £ 11million player in 2013			1
in the wider scheme of the club ’s spending in recent years , he might just be the best of the lot			0
he is the playmaker in the tight spaces , an attacking midfielder with enough sense of purpose that he has scored 16 goals in 51 @entity72 games			0
as @entity28 flopped out of @entity6 on thursday , @entity3 still managed to look good			1
the talented playmaker has netted nine @entity72 goals from midfield this season @entity76 ( right ) wants to instil the same winning mentality that @entity12 has at @entity0 if @entity78 is to follow @entity3 in succeeding in a second season , he will need some of the latter ’s resistance to expectations			1
as a talented @entity38 born to an ambitious father in @entity86 country , pressure is something @entity3 had to deal with from the start			1
that was vividly illustrated last october when , following a defeat for @entity33 against @entity92 , the national manager @entity90 hammered @entity3 in the press			1
the gist was that @entity3 , 22 then , ought to be controlling a game featuring @entity96			1
‘ he said it publicly and also told me personally , ’ @entity3 said			2
‘ sometimes it helps , sometimes it does n’t			0
i think it helped and it did n’t hurt			0
i ’ve grown up with that			0
my dad was a coach for me when i was seven to 13			0
he was a footballer as well , so he knew what he wanted			0
when i had a bad game , he would tell me to do better			0
‘ there were times when i closed my door pretty hard after i spoke to him			0
and then the day after , it ’s a new day			0
i ’ve learned to live with pressure			0
in the @entity113 newspapers the comparisons were with ( @entity116 ) @entity115 , so of course that started early			0
’ @entity3 was publicly criticised by @entity33 coach @entity90 ( right ) for his performance against @entity92 @entity3 has been impressed by the breakthrough made by leading scorer @entity78 ( left ) this season @entity120 ( right ) celebrates scoring during @entity28 's 5 - 3 victory over @entity0 in january pressure is a fascinating topic at @entity28			1
@entity76 has spoken frequently of the need to develop a winning mentality , given the team ’s dreadful run of results against the bigger clubs			0
the test for @entity78 will also come from maintaining what has been a sensational season			2
@entity3 said : ‘ what @entity78 ’s doing is impressive			1
but again , you always have the pressure from outside			0
now if he does n’t score he will feel it straight away			0
but @entity78 is a worker as well			2
he works for the team			0
he is not a striker who waits for the ball			0
’ the challenge now is for @entity28 ’s two leading outfield forces to take on a fresher , stronger @entity0 side			1
the 5 - 3 home win over @entity12 ’s side in january is still fresh in the mind			0
‘ we showed that we can beat them , ’ @entity3 said			2
now @entity3 must show @entity0 what they might have won			1
* @entity3 was speaking at a @entity149 event highlighting the @entity151 programme , which provides academy - standard coaching alongside btec and @entity155 level qualifications to create life - changing opportunities for young people aged 16 - 18 not in education , employment or training			2
