the @entity13 released a statement saying that ‘ the prestige of @entity5 is at stake , and must be preserved from being tainted by allowing the admission of a well - known aide to @entity8 , ’ in reference to @entity20			1
@entity20 , who spent the past year advising @entity8 amid a brutal crackdown on civilians , has remained hidden from public view in the luxurious @entity26 65th street townhouse owned by the @entity4 government , which she shares with her diplomat father , the @entity21 has reported			1
@entity12 grew close to president @entity8 's aide @entity29 while organizing the interview , and later emailed contacts at @entity32 and @entity5 to help her comely new friend @entity34 is the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity35			1
in a string of leaked emails between @entity38 and the celebrated broadcaster , @entity12 , 82 , promised to her help the 22 - year - old secure a job on @entity44 's @entity32 show and win a place at @entity5			1
@entity12 had heaped praise on @entity34 , calling her ‘ brilliant , beautiful ’ and addressing her as ‘ dear girl ’ in the emails			1
in one email , ms @entity12 told ' @entity52 ' how she had written to @entity32 host @entity44 and his top producer to ' say how terrific you are ' in hopes of helping her get a job at @entity58			1
the young woman responded , writing ' you can never be a better mom to your adopted child ( me )			0
' ' ms. @entity20 was admitted based solely on the submitted application materials , ' associate @entity5 dean @entity65 said in response to the controversy surrounding her acceptance			1
@entity20 was one of @entity8 's closest advisers and one of three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails to the dictator			1
making headlines : @entity12 was the first and only @entity76 journalist to interview @entity4 president @entity8 in december in the midst of violent uprisings in his country that have left thousands dead messages leaked by @entity4 rebels in march show her asking another of mr @entity8 's advisers to tell him : ' i love him so so so much and that i miss him			1
' the leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers , including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie			0
@entity12 first met miss @entity20 when the young woman 's father hosted a cocktail party in his @entity94 apartment in march of 2011			1
the @entity21 reports that the two women bonded that evening , and an unidentified diplomatic source said that the then - 21 - year - old ' was bragging that they had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail party '			0
that connection came in handy when the veteran reporter began dealing with miss @entity20 on a regular basis leading up the @entity105 ' exclusive televised interview with the @entity4 leader in december of 2011			2
in the interview , miss @entity12 pressed the president about the thousands of deaths of @entity4 citizens and he denied having issued any formal command for such force			2
ms @entity12 and @entity20 continued to talk via email long after the interview aired @entity115 , which published the most recent batch of hacked emails between @entity12 and @entity34 , reported that the interview was received poorly by @entity4 government officials because it ended up being more harsh on @entity8 than they originally expected			1
shortly after , @entity20 emailed the broadcaster in a panic , writing that she was ' in so much trouble ' over the interview			1
a few weeks later , miss @entity20 had determined that it was time for her to get out of @entity4 and join her father in the @entity76 - all the while remaining extremely loyal to @entity8 , who she called ' the dude '			1
in other emails obtained by @entity129 in march , @entity20 wrote that ' this man is loved by his people '			1
upon her move from @entity4 , miss @entity34 applied to @entity5 's @entity133 , and hoped to transition from her job as a press aide to @entity8 to a staffer at a major @entity76 news outlet			1
miss @entity12 immediately dismissed any talk of her working for @entity105 since it would be a breach of journalistic ethics			2
instead , she offered to reach out on behalf of the ' dear girl '			0
@entity12 signed emails ' hugs ' and ' love ' the pair appear extremely close , with miss @entity12 signing her emails with ‘ hugs ’ and ‘ love ’ and ms @entity20 promising to bring back jewellery from @entity4 for her so - called adoptive mother			1
their email exchange was obtained by @entity4 opposition forces who then passed them on to @entity115			0
@entity12 emailed @entity155 professor @entity154 , former president of @entity156 and vice president of @entity105 , to sing miss @entity34 's praises			1
' she is brilliant , beautiful , speaks five languages			0
anything you can do to help ? ' ms @entity12 wrote at the end of january			2
mr @entity154 responded that while his position at the @entity155 is unconnected to the @entity133 , he would do his best to help , saying that ' through the @entity167 network , i will get them to give her special attention			0
i am sure they will take her			0
' now , @entity5 is saying that while she was accepted , mr @entity154 's intervention - if any - had nothing to do with it			1
' we can not comment on an individual applicant ’s materials , which are confidential , ' ms @entity173 said			0
mr @entity154 's son , @entity177 , is the executive producer of @entity58 , was also the recipient of an email from @entity12			2
she told @entity38 that she wrote to both @entity177 and @entity44 on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration , even though she was unsure if they had any availability			2
that specific email was not released			0
neither @entity186 nor miss @entity34 heard back from @entity32 or the younger mr @entity154			2
the @entity21 has reported that admissions officers ignored the warning of 27 - year - old @entity189 , the only @entity4 in the @entity5 international program ’s 2012 graduating class specifically asked about @entity34 ’s credentials			2
@entity155 professor @entity154 had allegedly promised to help @entity34 get accepted into the international public affairs program ' i told them they should not let the girl in			0
she is horrible and supporting the regime , ' @entity189 recalled			0
' i was sure she was n’t going to be admitted because of her strong affiliation with the government and all the human - rights violations			0
it was completely shocking that she was admitted			0
' @entity189 went on to say that @entity34 ' was helping portray that the killings are not happening , and for @entity12 to support someone like that , having been in @entity4 and knowing what is happening , is very disturbing			2
' @entity189 told the @entity209 that one of her friends , a @entity211 film student , was killed in @entity214 in may while documenting the uprising			0
the 27 - year - old added that more than 40 of her friends have been imprisoned under @entity8 ’s regime in the last 15 months , making @entity34 ’s acceptance into the program a particularly painful blow for @entity221			2
‘ i ’ve been familiar with the kind of work she does for the government and the fact that she ’s a supporter of the regime to this moment , ’ she said			0
‘ and this is a regime that has killed more than 15,000 civilians			0
’ in the wake of the emails , miss @entity12 released a statement expressing her ‘ regret ’ in helping @entity20 get admitted into the highly competitive master ’s program , which rejects four out of five applicants			1
mad : @entity189 is a former @entity5 student who told the school not to admit @entity20 ' in the aftermath ( of the @entity8 interview ) , miss @entity20 returned to the @entity76 and contacted me looking for a job			1
i told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her , ' ms @entity12 said in the statement			0
during her initial response to the allegations , @entity12 did not know that the young woman had , in fact , been accepted to the program , but she still expressed her regret			0
' i did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organization and in academia , though she did n't get a job or into school			0
in retrospect , i realize that this created a conflict and i regret that			0
' at a charity event in @entity264 on monday , however , miss @entity12 has denied any knowledge of the controversy , according to the @entity21 .			0

leaked emails show @entity12 promised to help @entity29 , 22 , land a job on @entity44 's @entity32 show and a place at @entity5
