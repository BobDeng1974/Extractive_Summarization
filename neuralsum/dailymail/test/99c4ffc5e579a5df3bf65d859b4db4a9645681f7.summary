a space company owned by @entity2 founder @entity1 has finished work on a rocket engine for a suborbital spaceship			1
called @entity6 , the firm expects to begin flight tests this year			1
the so - called @entity10 spaceship is designed to fly three people and / or a mix of passengers and payloads to altitudes about 62 miles ( 100 km ) above @entity16			1
it will launch from @entity6 's west @entity26 facility near @entity27 , @entity26 , southeast of @entity28			0
testing and development of the rocket engine , called @entity31 , has been completed , the last major milestone before the liquid oxygen - and liquid hydrogen - fueled motor is attached to the @entity10 capsule for flight , @entity6 president @entity33 told reporters on a conference call			0
privately owned @entity6 has not started selling tickets for flights on @entity10 or released pricing information			1
' the engine is ready for flight ... and ready for other commercial users , ' @entity33 said			0
he declined to be more specific about when @entity10 would fly , except to say ' soon			1
' the @entity10 system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys			0
the @entity10 vehicle includes a @entity51 carrying three or more astronauts atop a separate rocket - powered @entity53 , launched from the firm 's @entity55			1
following liftoff , the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes			0
the @entity53 then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the @entity51			0
the @entity53 will finish its flight , descend to @entity16 , and autonomously perform a rocket - powered vertical landing			1
the @entity51 will go on to coast to the edge of space , providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the @entity16 and the beauty of our planet			1
after descent and reentry into @entity16 ’s atmosphere , the @entity51 will land under parachutes near the launch site			1
in addition , the @entity10 vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment			2
@entity6 's @entity82 the capsule will fly dozens of times unmanned before the test flights include pilots , @entity33 added			2
when finished , the @entity10 vehicle includes a @entity51 carrying three or more astronauts atop a separate rocket - powered @entity53 , launched from the firm 's @entity55			2
following liftoff , the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes			0
the @entity53 then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the @entity51			0
the @entity53 will finish its flight , descend to @entity16 , and autonomously perform a rocket - powered vertical landing			1
the @entity51 will go on to coast to the edge of space , providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the @entity16 and the beauty of our planet			1
after descent and reentry into @entity16 ’s atmosphere , the @entity51 will land under parachutes near the launch site			1
@entity6 is among a handful of companies planning to offer commercial spaceflight services			0
@entity10 is a suborbital system , like @entity113 's @entity112 , a six - passenger , two - pilot spaceplane that is expected to resume test flights later this year following a fatal accident in @entity118 , @entity119 , on oct. 31 , 2014			2
another company , privately owned @entity121 , is working on a two - seater spaceplane called @entity123 that also is slated to debut this year , founder and chief technology officer @entity125 said			0
other companies , including @entity127 , or @entity127 , and @entity128 , are skipping suborbital spaceflight and developing systems to carry people into orbit			2
@entity6 intends to parlay its suborbital @entity10 vehicle into an orbital launch system , expected to begin flying later this decade			2
that vehicle will be powered by a liquefied natural gas motor , called the be- 4 , that is being developed with @entity139 , a partnership of @entity141 and @entity128			0
the recently completed @entity138 engine also will be modified to serve as an upper - stage motor to fly satellites into orbit , @entity33 said .			0

new @entity148 spaceship is designed to fly three people
will reach altitudes about 62 miles ( 100 km ) above @entity16
firm expected to sell *tourist* tickets for its *spacecraft*
