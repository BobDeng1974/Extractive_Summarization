@entity21 's cross-kick to the corner was caught by @entity0 , who touched down for his first international try			0
@entity0 made the perfect start to his international career , scoring just a minute into his debut the new @entity3 winger had a debut to remember , running in three tries against a powerful @entity31 side three penalties by @entity21 took @entity3 into halftime 14 - 0 ahead , highlighting their dominance as the @entity31 struggled to create a scoring chance			1
' the players were able to let themselves go without asking too many questions , which is what you need to do in games like this , ' @entity37 captain @entity36 told broadcaster @entity3 2			0
' the level will be a lot higher next week , but we can be satisfied with what we did tonight			0

@entity87 goes over for his excellent try but it was only a consolation for @entity4 in @entity98 the win will be a relief for @entity3 manager @entity101 who has come underfire after a string of poor performances amid concerns he is failing to find the right blend with less than a year until the @entity107			1
