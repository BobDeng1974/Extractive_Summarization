when sir @entity1 retired last may he called for evolution rather than revolution as @entity4 moved forward under @entity5			2
@entity6 , however , has taken a different approach			0
having succeeded @entity5 , the @entity8 said he would give the players he inherited a chance to impress			0
evidently , he did n't fancy what he saw and quickly began putting his own stamp on the squad			0
gone are the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 as @entity20 showed 12 players the @entity23 door , another seven left on loan and @entity25 called time on his glittering career			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity19 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) have both left @entity4 since last season 's first derby @entity31 ( right ) started last season 's derby at the @entity34 and is expected to do the same on sunday @entity35 is yellow carded in @entity4 's 4 - 1 defeat at @entity38 last season @entity40 ( second right ) scores @entity38 's first goal in their 4 - 1 win last september in their place has come a cavalry costing £ 150million - the @entity8 's ' @entity47 '			1
the startling change of pace at @entity23 can be measured by the fact that only five of @entity5 ' players from last season 's derby at the @entity34 are likely to start again on sunday			1
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity31 and @entity35 were part of the team that were humbled 4 - 1 in 2013 as @entity5 ' reign quickly unravelled			1
they will be hoping that the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 will provide the necessary quality to bridge the gap that has developed between the two rivals in the last year			2
@entity4 's team may be even more unrecognisable come kick - off on sunday if @entity20 opts to start his other two new signings , @entity72 and @entity73 , who are both returning to full fitness after injury			1
@entity76 and @entity77 both started against @entity78 last week and could further alter @entity4 's team			1
whoever starts at the @entity34 , they will line up in a completely different system than under @entity5			0
last season 's derby team ( left ) and the expected line - up on sunday ( right )			2
only five players ( in yellow ) survive @entity6 let 19 players go over the summer and has transformed his @entity4 team analysts @entity90 predict that a @entity38 win is the most likely outcome against @entity4 the 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 and 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formations ( and their variations ) favoured by @entity5 and @entity1 seem a distant memory as @entity20 has lurched from an unsuccessful experiment with 3 - 5 - 2 to a free - flowing 4 - 4 - 2 diamond formation			1
@entity20 has not been afraid to stick to his principles - even if they go against the traditions of @entity4 - and this can not always have been said of @entity5			2
part of the reason @entity5 struggled was the fact he was caught between his style and @entity4 's style , which left the players unsure of their roles			1
@entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 ( right ) will be two of the new faces on display for @entity4 on sunday @entity111 ( right ) will be another player experiencing his first @entity113 derby on sunday as @entity19 writes in his autobiography : ' @entity5 ’s innovations mostly led to negativity and confusion			1
sometimes our main tactic was the long , high , diagonal cross			0
' other times @entity5 wanted lots of passing			0
he ’d say : " today i want us to have 600 passes in the game			0
last week it was only 400 "			0
who cares ? i ’d rather score five goals from 10 passes			0
' what we can be sure of is that @entity4 's players will walk onto the @entity34 pitch and know precisely what is expected of them			1
the players will be different and the style will be different , but will the end result be different , too ? @entity140 star @entity139 happy at @entity4			2

@entity4 lost 4 - 1 to @entity38 last september
only five players who started that game are expected to start on sunday
@entity6 let 19 players leave as he *revamped* @entity4 's squad
