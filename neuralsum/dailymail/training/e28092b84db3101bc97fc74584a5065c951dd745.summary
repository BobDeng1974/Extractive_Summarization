by @entity0 a football fan who was shocked into slimming after being involved in a road accident has won a national award for losing more than 22st			2
at 37st , @entity5 regularly felt embarrassment when he could n’t fit through turnstiles as he followed his beloved @entity8 around the country , but it was a minor car crash that finally forced him to face up to his size			1
it motivated him to lose 22st 9lbs and now he has been named @entity12			2
@entity5 used to struggle even to enter the stadium of his beloved football team due to his 37st frame the 43 - year - old , from @entity17 in @entity18 , says : ' luckily the incident was n’t serious but the paramedics had to be called			1
' it was then i realised that if the accident had been more serious and i ’d been injured they probably would have found me very difficult to treat			0
' i started asking myself , " would they have been able to get me out of the car ? " , " would they have been able to lift me into the ambulance ? " , " would they have needed specialist equipment ? " and lots of other questions like that			0
' i realised that any or all of those things could have prevented them from getting me to hospital in time and , ultimately , from saving my life			0
that was really my wake - up call and i joined @entity12 soon afterwards			2
' @entity5 , who is single , struggled with his weight from a young age but remembers his size increasing rapidly around eight years ago			1
he says : ' i was always described as " big - boned " , but when i hit 35 it seems like i was always having to buy bigger and bigger clothes			0
@entity5 dropped from 37st to 14st 5lb in 16 months to be crowned @entity12 's @entity48 breakfast : three rashers of fried bacon , three fried sausages , two fried eggs , two slices of toast or a large cob ( bread roll ) lunch : two large cobs or bread rolls with coronation chicken , a large bag of crisps and various chocolate bars dinner : two chicken tikka slices ( pasty filled with chicken tikka ) , two or three packets of ready - made sandwiches , a share bag of crisps snacks : various chocolate bars throughout the day breakfast : 35g cereal with berries mid-morning : two bananas lunch : jacket potato and baked beans with lots of fresh salad mid-afternoon : tubs of prepared fresh fruit , such as mango , melon and pineapple dinner : grilled chicken breast , boiled rice , carrots , green beans , broccoli and cauliflower snacks : a small chocolate bar , three @entity99 light cheese , pickled onions ' i tried going to the gym to lose weight but it never seemed to shift because i was n’t changing my eating habits , and in the end i stopped going			1
' after his accident in august 2012 , @entity5 ’s sister and stepmother recommended @entity12 and – with some trepidation – he joined a nearby group in @entity112 - in - @entity113 the following month			1
he says : ' i was very apprehensive about walking into the group on that first night as i knew there ’d probably be lots of women and not very many men , but everyone was friendly and i got a warm welcome			0
football fan : @entity5 lost 22 stone after he was too big to fit in through the turnstiles to watch @entity8 play ' i ca n’t speak highly enough of the whole experience and i ’ve had so much support from my consultant @entity127 and the rest of the group			1
i ’m always encouraging other men to join now and one of my male colleagues has even lost 3st			2
' civil servant @entity5 , who works for @entity133 , started following the club ’s @entity135 healthy eating plan			2
instead of tucking into convenience foods , he began planning his meals and making time to cook from scratch			0
he says he has rediscovered his love of cooking : ' i was pleasantly surprised when @entity127 explained the plan			1
' i was amazed at the variety of foods that i could eat without having to restrict my portions and was delighted that i could still enjoy all my favourite meals just by making changes to the way i prepared and cooked them			0
currently my favourite meal is a @entity152 chicken curry			0
' as the weight came off @entity5 decided to start being more active and now loves running , cycling and playing football			1
he says : ' before i joined @entity12 i would park the car as close to wherever i was going as humanly possible because i found walking just short distances very difficult			2
' now i cycle around 40 miles a week , run around 15 miles a week and play five - a - side football twice a week – and i love it			1
i ’m hoping to do a half marathon next year and would like to enter a triathlon too			0
' i ’ve got two nephews who i ’m much closer to now because i can run around with them and do more adventurous things like visit theme parks and take them on holiday			0
' this january , just 16 months after joining @entity12 , @entity5 hit his target weight of 14st 5lbs			1
he ’s dropped 34in from his waist , going from 70in to 36in , and lost 14in from his collar measurement too			1

@entity5 , who works the scoreboard at @entity8 ’s @entity187 , says : ' i used to struggle to fit through the turnstiles but now i go through them with ease – and a big smile on my face			2
' in fact there are so many things i can do that i could n’t have even attempted when i was bigger – playing football with my nephews , buying clothes on the high street , flying on a plane without having to ask for a seatbelt extension and much more			0
