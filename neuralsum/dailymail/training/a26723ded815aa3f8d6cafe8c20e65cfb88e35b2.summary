the @entity0 officially said thursday what @entity1 and @entity2 knew days beforehand : that president @entity4 would travel to @entity5 and @entity6 this week for a series of fundraisers			1
the events were n't part of the president 's public schedule , but they became common knowledge after enterprising reporters obtained copies of exclusive invites for events with the president and shared them online			1
the omission from @entity4 ’s public schedule was n’t an anomaly			0
the president and his administration have made a habit out of telling reporters at the last minute about previously scheduled out - of - town trips , fundraisers and speaking engagements			0
today president @entity4 had lunch at the @entity0 with a group of teachers			2
the luncheon was one of the few events included on the president 's public schedule today every president has a private daily schedule that a limited number of his staff are privy to , containing details of all the president 's activities throughout the day , including even his designated workout schedule and golf tee times			1
reporters usually do n't find out about those outings until they are happening , and the public is only informed that the president has left the @entity0 if someone from the @entity0 press corps writes about it or a bystander posts photos online			2
as @entity60 pointed out today , items like the president 's recent lunch with former secretary of state @entity59 are often included on the secret , detailed copy of the president 's schedule but are left off his public itinerary if they 're considered part of his private life			2
neither the public nor the press would have ever known about that meeting if @entity68 had n't told a reporter from @entity70 , who in turn tweeted – and deleted – a note and a picture related to the secret encounter			0
the @entity0 is not required to tell the public about the president 's whereabouts but it sometimes opts to announce events the president holds at the @entity0 as part of his presidential duties the purpose of the president 's secret schedule is to give him a modicum of privacy			1
but the current administration regularly keeps events @entity4 attends or holds in his capacity as @entity91 off the schedule it makes available on the @entity0 website			1
the move is meant to stop members of @entity4 's cabinet , @entity98 , representatives from allied groups , and even the public from crashing events to which they were n't invited			2
it 's especially meant to keep aggressive reporters from asking questions about meetings or events the @entity0 wants to keep secret			0
which presidential activities are made available to the press is completely up to his handlers			0
no law requires the executive branch to release any details at all about the president 's whereabouts			1
and his schedule is n't subject to @entity120 requests			0
a comprehensive analysis of the president 's public schedule versus events @entity4 was photographed at in 2009 completed by @entity125 just before the 2012 election found that the @entity0 kept secret at least one - third of the events the president held or attended until after they had happened			1
' i would say the daily schedule they hand out is on the shallow side compared to presidents past , ' longtime @entity0 reporter @entity130 of @entity131 told @entity125 at the time.anniversary the @entity0 listed this may 7 , 2014 , @entity138 event in @entity139 , @entity140 , on the president 's public schedule , but it did not mention that @entity4 would be rubbing elbows with director @entity144 , second from left , and @entity145 , right , at the dinner @entity147 has changed in the time since @entity125 published its report			1
if anything , the president has went off - map more often			0
last week press found out the president would be giving remarks on the economy at a tech startup in downtown @entity158 after the president had already left the @entity0			0
on another recent occasion the president snuck off with vice president @entity162 to have lunch with construction workers at a downtown @entity165			0
the @entity0 still has n't published details on the president 's travel to @entity139 , @entity140 , later this month , even though @entity169 revealed in june that @entity4 would appear at fundraisers there on july 23 and 24 on behalf of the @entity172			1
@entity169 is also responsible for making public the president 's fundraisers in @entity6			0
it was n't until a reporter asked @entity0 press secretary @entity176 last monday about the alleged trip to the @entity6 that the @entity0 confirmed the president 's plans			2
the @entity0 did n't send out details about @entity4 's travel to @entity181 , @entity5 , tomorrow night until this morning – three and a half weeks after the @entity182 reported it			1
as the midterm elections draw nearer , the president is expected to attend a long series of events benefiting his political party but the public is most likely to find out about those events , too , as they occur – or by happenstance .			0

the @entity0 maintains a private schedule for the president that it gives out *sparingly*
it is not required to provide the public with any details at all about the president 's whereabouts , but *traditionally* it lists events the president holds or attends in his capacity as an elected official on the @entity0 website
this administration regularly fails to inform the press or the public about many of @entity4 's activities , however
