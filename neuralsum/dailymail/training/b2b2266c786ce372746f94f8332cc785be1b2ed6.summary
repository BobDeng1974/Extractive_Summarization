the @entity28 of @entity6 argues in its contempt motion filed in @entity30 in @entity31 that three times a day is n't what judge @entity34 's jan. 11 ruling required			0
@entity36 said @entity2 , 32 , sincerely believes @entity37 mandates @entity4 pray together five times a day and federal law requires the prison to accommodate his beliefs			1
the motion also said prayer times set by the prison make only two daily prayers possible at some times during the year or make prayers impossible to perform at proper times			0
the prison has ‘ knowingly and intentionally established a procedure and schedule for prayers that prevents @entity2 and other @entity4 prisoners within the @entity20 from engaging in congregate prayer during all times that they are released from their cells , ’ the motion said			1
@entity60 , legal director of the @entity28 of @entity6 , said it was ‘ immensely disappointing that the federal government feels it can avoid complying with the judge 's order			2

at other times , inmates had to pray alone in their cells and hope to hear each other through the walls			0
@entity36 found the policy violated a 1993 law banning the government from curtailing religious speech without showing a compelling interest , and the government chose not to appeal her ruling			2
prison officials said during the trial on @entity2 's lawsuit that allowing group prayers every day would pose a security risk and that inmates had used religion as cover for gang - like activity , but the judge dismissed those arguments as insubstantial			1
