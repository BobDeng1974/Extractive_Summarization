by @entity0 employers have been warned that writing honest references for former employees could land them in court if they are particularly negative			1
employment experts have warned that a written reference which is critical of a former employee could see them sued for defamation or even ' post-employment victimisation '			2
this follows a recent case where a car body repairer successfully sued his former employers after they provided a poor reference to an employment agency after he complained about discrimination			1
employers have been warned that they may face court action if they write overly negative references about former employees attending job interviews ( picture posed by models ) litigation fears could even see good candidates receiving bland references summarising only the briefest of details of their career			1
@entity32 , a tax partner at @entity34 told @entity35 that employers can speak freely on the phone but written references tend to be compiled by human resource managers ' intended to say as little as possible '			2
he said : ' if you are downbeat about someone and they have an offer withdrawn , there is a concern over whether you have defamed them			0
if you are too generous , the new employer could say " this guy turned out to be an idiot "			0
' former employees can access written references supplied to prospective employers under the @entity54			1
a recent case in the @entity56 saw car body repairer @entity57 awarded almost Â£ 25,000 for unfair dismissal and age discrimination against his former employer @entity61 from @entity63 , @entity64			0
employers who give bad references about former employees could face prosecution for ' post-relationship victimisation ' after the @entity56 upheld a recent @entity72 discrimination case ( picture posed by models ) the court heard that a director from the company gave mr @entity57 a poor reference because he had made a complaint about discrimination before leaving the company			1
the court upheld an earlier @entity72 decision that mr @entity57 had suffered ' post-employment victimisation ' as a result of the bad reference and had been discriminated against			2
the @entity87 said ' post relationship victimisation ' should be specifically outlawed			0
the @entity87 's legal director @entity89 said : ' we supported this case in order to clarify an important principle of law namely that the @entity95 should be read as prohibiting victimisation which happens after someone has left their job and is then treated unfavourably because they have made allegations of discrimination			0
' the fact that this claim has been successful means that it is clear that this protection also applies to former relationships in education , services , public functions and associations			0

employers warned they could face legal action for giving a poor reference
@entity56 *upholds* decision citing ' post-relationship victimisation '
written references now contain only the briefest of details
employees can access references under @entity127 *legislation*
