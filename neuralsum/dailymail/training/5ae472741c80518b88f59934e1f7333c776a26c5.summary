by @entity1 reporter published : 11:36 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 04:01 est , 15 august 2012 the source of a huge cluster of floating volcanic rocks spotted last week off the coast of @entity6 has been discovered			1
@entity9 satellite images and earthquake records have pinpointed an erupting undersea volcano called the @entity11 as the culprit			0
the enormous mass of floating pumice covers almost 26,000 square kilometres ( 10,000 square miles ) and was found drifting in the @entity16 , the @entity13 said on friday			2
an area of floating pumice 250 nautical miles in length and 30 nautical miles wide in the @entity16 the pumice was found half way between @entity6 and @entity22 by the @entity13 while sailing southwest of @entity24 this @entity9 satellite image shows the pumice and the position of the volcano the strange phenomenon , which witnesses said resembled a polar ice shelf , was made up of lightweight pumice expelled from an underwater volcano , the navy said			2
an air force plane spotted the rocks on thursday about 1,000 kilometres ( 600 miles ) offshore from @entity6 and warned a navy warship that it was heading towards them			1
lieutenant @entity41 said that while he knew his ship , @entity43 , was in no danger from the pumice , which is solidified lava filled with air bubbles , it was still the weirdest thing he 's seen in 18 years at sea			1
' as far ahead as i could observe was a raft of pumice moving up and down with the swell , ' he said			0
' the rock looked to be sitting two foot ( half a metre ) above the surface of the waves and lit up a brilliant while colour in the spotlight			0
it looked exactly like the edge of an ice shelf			0
' earlier scientists aboard the ship said the pumice probably came from an underwater volcano called @entity66 , which has been active recently			0
they said the phenomenon was unrelated to increased volcanic activity in @entity6 recently , including an eruption at @entity70 that sent an ash cloud 20,000 feet into the atmosphere			2
@entity6 frigates regularly patrol past ice shelves in the @entity75 sailors aboard @entity77 thought they were looking at an ice shelf when they saw the floating pumice video : seen from the air ! the amazing mass of volcanic rock floating in the sea !			1
