by @entity0 published : 08:46 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 fire officials knew the storm which fanned flames around team of 19 ' hotshot ' elite firemen who were killed in the blaze , was on its way an hour before it hit but did nothing pull out their men , a report had found			1
the investigation by the @entity15 of @entity16 has recommended $ 559,000 worth of fines are paid by the state 's @entity18 , citing poor communication between those directing crews on the ground			1
the leader of the investigation @entity26 said : ' the storm was anticipated , it was forecasted , everybody knew it			2
but there was no plan to move people out of the way			0
tragedy : winds from a thunderstorm fanned the flames toward the tragic 19 hotshots , but fire chiefs did not pull out their men in time destroyed : the report said that by keeping crews on the mountain they were prioritizing the safety of property before the lives of its firefighters in addition , senior fire managers had already determined that the town they were battling to save was indefensible , he said			1
the finding was a rebuke to an earlier investigation commissioned by the @entity18 , which found that state fire officials communicated poorly during the disaster			1
now the @entity18 itself has been linked to the death of the @entity61 , who were killed in a blaze near the small community of @entity65 of @entity66			1
the team were trapped as the flames they were battling changed direction in a fierce thunderstorm june 30			1
all but one member of the crew died			0
the @entity74 oversaw the fight against the blaze that sparked on state land			2
the @entity79 investigation found that state fire officials lacked key personnel to battle the @entity82 at critical times			1
@entity26 , the safety agency 's lead investigator , told the commission there should have been officers to ensure firefighters ' safety , a planning section chief and a division supervisor , who was n't replaced after he abandoned his post			1
@entity93 , left , and @entity94 , right , lost their lives in @entity82 , @entity3 in april this year @entity94 ( left ) followed his father captain @entity96 ( right ) of the @entity97 to become a hot shot and was in his first year when he died @entity26 told commissioners that fire managers should have removed firefighters an hour before the thunderstorm arrived			1
the commission 's chairman , @entity103 , said he believed the fire management team on site did everything in its power to defend the community and provide for the safety of people			1
he said : ' but it 's not the intention of the people that ( is ) in question , it 's that employees remained exposed after they no longer should be exposed			0
' heroes : a group photograph shows members of the @entity121 @entity122 , a spokeswoman for the @entity18 , said the agency fully cooperated with the investigation and declined comment			0
the @entity18 now has 15 working days to appeal			0
gov. @entity127 's office also declined comment , citing pending litigation			0
the mother of one of the firefighters has filed a $ 36 million notice of claim against the state , @entity136 and the city of @entity138 , saying their negligence led to the death of her son			1
the safety agency 's review occurred simultaneously but separately from a three - month investigation by national experts into the circumstances surrounding the deaths			2
tragic : @entity148 ( right ) also died in the inferno on june 30			2
he had followed in the footsteps of his father , @entity151 ( left ) , who was once the fire captain of @entity153 , @entity154 that report was released in september and found lapses in communication from the crew in the hour before the firefighters died			1
it also found that proper procedure was followed but did not say whether deaths were avoidable nor did it place blame			2
the @entity79 investigation found that the state @entity18 did n't respond to a request the evening before for two safety officers , key positions in large firefighting efforts			2
@entity26 said the oversight was the result of an unknown mistake			0
' apparently , it got dropped ... the ball got dropped			0
' killed : @entity176 , pictured with his family , also died with his team on the mountainside fallen : @entity181 , pictured , was one of the 19 victims firefighting crews were still battling the fire even after the incident command post was evacuated , according to the @entity79 report			1
the bulk of the proposed fine is $ 475,000 - $ 25,000 for each of the 19 deaths			1
that money will be paid to the firefighters ' families			1
they were employed by the city of @entity138 but working under a standing contract with the state @entity18 for the @entity82			0
the @entity79 investigation found that the city of @entity138 was in compliance with standards for training and crew rest			0
missed : fallen firefighter @entity203 , pictured , had been married for seven years and had four children the crew members had been in a relatively safe position on a ridge top			0
for an unknown reason and without notifying anyone , they moved down the mountainside through an unburned area where they were trapped by a wall of flames when winds shifted the fire in their direction			2
they deployed their emergency shelters but perished in the scorching heat			0
the surviving crew member , @entity221 , was away from the others and acting as a lookout			0
he might have suffered the same fate had he not been picked up by another crew leader who happened to be driving by after @entity221 radioed in to say he was retreating , @entity26 said			0
highly trained : members of the @entity227 ( pictured last year ) had been fighting wildfire in @entity229 and elsewhere in @entity3 ' essentially , it was in the nick of time , and he did n't have to deploy his shelter ' @entity26 said			2
the report praised the @entity227 for remaining ' alert , unimaginably calm , thinking clearly and taking decisive action			1
' while the crew followed most of standard firefighting guidelines , the safety agency faulted the men for not scouting or timing alternative escape routes , not having a lookout as they moved toward a ranch property identified as a safety zone , and not notifying their supervisor of their movements			2
the fire destroyed more than 100 homes and burned 13 square miles before it was fully contained on july 10			0
@entity103 , right , chairman of the @entity249 of @entity3 looks over the report which was a damning criticism of fire chiefs moving : @entity252 , widow of @entity203 , one of the 19 fallen firefighters from the @entity82 , looks skyward during the hearing @entity255 , whose son @entity94 was killed , is a firefighter himself in northern @entity3			1
he said it 's time for the state ' to change the coach			0
' he said : ' as far as blaming somebody at this point , right now , on a personal level , i think it 's futile ' ' but having been a captain on a fire engine , and worked in the fire service as long as i have , i know that if i was involved in an incident where somebody was injured or killed , then my butt would have been on the hot seat and i would have been held accountable			1
' family members who attended the hearing sobbed softly when the names of the dead were read			0
@entity252 , whose husband , @entity203 , was killed , said the report provides important insight			0
she said : ' finally , people that are educated , that are experienced , that have researched it and have a less biased opinion - they 're just there objectively - that they get it			0
