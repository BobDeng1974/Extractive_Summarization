by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 18 october 2013 asian - americans have very low obesity rates but are at a high risk of heart disease and diabetes because their bodies are more likely to store fat around organs asian - americans may have a misguided sense of how healthy they are because medical surveys often create a misleading average @entity14 score by defining their ethnic group too broadly , experts have claimed			2
recent figures released by the @entity17 have been criticised for propagating a ' model minority myth ' after it lumped at least ten countries in that category without regard for regional trends			2
the survey classed somebody as @entity25 if they had descendants from @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , among others			1
for example , @entity35 adults are 70 per cent more likely to be obese than the rest of the @entity25 - @entity43 population — but about one in 10 @entity45 and @entity46 adults is underweight			1
@entity47 , program director for the @entity48 , says he has encountered funding issues because of the misleading statistics and even has trouble convincing his own family to live healthier lives			2
mr @entity47 added : ' combined together , it looks like we do n’t have a problem , it kind of propagates that " model minority " myth — that @entity59 are healthier , we ’re skinny , we ’re fine			0
' ' the attitude among many @entity25 is “ i ’m skinny , and i ’m @entity25 , i should be fine — i do n’t have to worry about obesity and diabetes			1
" ' the figures also showed that just 11 per cent of @entity25 are obese but doctors have said they are at a high risk of heart disease because of the way their bodies store fat			1
their bodies are more likely to be apple - shaped , storing fat around their waist which can lead to it penetrating the liver , and are more likely to pack fat in between organs			0
figures published in the @entity17 show that 10.8 per cent of @entity59 are obese , compared to 33 per cent of whites , 42 per cent of @entity80 or 48 per cent of black people			1
just 11 per cent of @entity43 @entity59 are obese compared with 33 per cent of whites , 42 per cent of @entity80 and 48 per cent of blacks , a survey has shown for most people a body mass index ( @entity14 ) of over 25 is considered overweight , but @entity25 people have been known to develop fat - related illnesses with a @entity14 of just 19 - which is technically underweight			1
scientists also criticised the survey for using a very broad definition of @entity25 making the category effectively ' meaningless ' ( file picture ) speaking to @entity97 , dr. @entity94 , a professor of medicine at the @entity96 , said : ' it looks as if we do n’t have a problem			1
but it ’s a huge problem			0
' there are huge differences where weight does not adequately reflect the realities of complications from being overweight			0
' for @entity59 , you do not have to be overweight to get the complications for obesity			0
' but that is likely to be masking a problem in the @entity25 community , leading people to falsely believe that they are healthier than they actually are			2
@entity14 is a figure calculated by comparing a person 's weight and height			0
a bm of less than 20 is considered underweight , 20 - 25 is in the normal range , 25 - 30 classes a person as overweight and a @entity14 of 30 or higher is considered obese			1
it is still the standard method by which doctors calculate obesity , but has been discredited for being overly - simplistic , diagnosing some professional athletes as overweight			0
health experts have said that a more helpful benchmark for measuring obesity in any population may be to consider waist circumference and fat distribution , both of which are highly correlated with metabolic syndrome .			0

new survey shows just 11 per cent of @entity25 are obese
but term covers *dozens* of *nationalities* with wide range of eating habits
@entity35 70 *%* more likely to be obese than other @entity25 , but one in ten @entity144 are underweight
