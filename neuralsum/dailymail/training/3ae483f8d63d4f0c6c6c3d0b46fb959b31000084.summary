he had applied for a @entity42 passport soon after the @entity97 won elections in @entity10 last year			0
the move involved transferring his 31 per cent stake in @entity101 , the family holding that controls @entity85 , to @entity103 , a @entity42 firm that he specifically set up for the purpose			0
family home : hayek with her daughter @entity108 shortly after her birth in 2007			0

@entity42 has a much more lenient tax regime than @entity10 – raising an inheritance tax of three per cent , compared to 11 per cent in @entity10			1
unlike @entity10 , there is no wealth tax in @entity42 either			2

mr @entity15 already had two children by his first wife and a third by @entity145 supermodel @entity144			1

he told the @entity156 in march : ' @entity7 is hot			0
