third in command : @entity1 was only behind @entity2 and the group 's current leader , @entity3 the @entity6 government have released private diaries of a @entity9 prisoner thought to be third in command in terrorist organisation @entity11			1
translated journals , belonging to @entity1 , were made public under a @entity14 request by @entity15 and give a startling insight into the inner workings of the operation			1
the diaries start in 1990 , span the decade leading up to the 9/11 attack and end just day before @entity1 is captured in march 2002 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity11 's growth from battling against the @entity26 occupiers of @entity27 into the terror organisation that carried out the 2001 attack in @entity30 is tracked through the the six volumes			1
zubaydah changes from student to jihadi over the course of his writings , the @entity32 writes			1
the @entity39 - born @entity38 – was a 19 - year - old student in computer sciences in @entity42 , @entity43 , a few months before he travelled to join the @entity27 civil war that followed the @entity26 departure			1
when he was caught by @entity6 troops , he was regarded as the third - ranking figure in @entity11 , behind only @entity2 and the group ’s current leader , @entity3 , by the @entity49			1
@entity1 was thought to be one of the planners of the 9/11 attacks and also involved in every other major attack perpetrated by @entity11 in the past decade , including the 1998 @entity6 embassy bombings in @entity55			1
the prisoner was one of the first detainees from the terrorist organisation to be subjected to the ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' and was waterboarded 83 times at a @entity49 site in @entity62 by officers trying to get information about future terror attacks			1
the @entity67 administration changed its view of how important @entity1 was when they realised he was not a frontline operative			1
attack : @entity1 was thought to be one of the planners of the 9/11 attacks and also involved in every other major attack perpetrated by @entity11 in the past decade detained : @entity1 was taken to @entity9 in 2006 and remains there although he has never been charged with any crime january 6 , @entity76 , and only yesterday , i decided to go to @entity27			1
i believe that i have talked to you about a plan to go to @entity27 before , which was unsuccessful			2
however , this time it is different [ the rest of the sentence is crossed out and illegible ]			2
i have decided to visit the place , receive training and come back to conclude my education			2
the intent is bona fide , @entity87 willing			2
almost everything is ready except that i am scared of the circumstances			2
yet i trust in @entity87			2
and we seek refuge in him.january 19 , @entity92 arrived yesterday morning ; we are in peshawar.the system here , as we have learned later on , is as follows : first : the services office ; it is an office that handles jihad matters and @entity99 mujahedin ’s organisation as well as support to both @entity99 and @entity27 mujahedin			2
from that office branches many houses for the incoming mujahedin from outside @entity27 , @entity99 and others			2
the spiritual atmosphere here is @entity108 came to train for a short period and go back just to be prepared			2
others are here for jihad and until @entity87 decides for something to be done			0
some are young ; their beards or moustache have not appeared yet			0
others are old in their fifties or more			0
also , the idea of settling here is enticing me and i can not seem to control @entity119 1 , @entity121 brother , @entity120 , came finally			0
in short , we sat together and talked			0
he talked about many things that are somehow frustrating ; the mother , the father , the brothers and parents ’ obedience and , in addition to few quick fatwas created by his emotions			0
anyway , we both do not and will not understand each @entity134 , dear @entity135 , we sat by the stream that runs through the camp			0
he was reading my father ’s letter to me ; i gave it to him to read it			0
he said , “ read your father ’s letter ; it is better for you			0
” he meant what they are suffering from because of me			0
i smiled and ripped it before his eyes while he is shocked and hurt and his face became gloomy			0
i tried explaining to him the importance of sacrifice for the sake of the religion and he tried , may @entity87 bless him , to explain to me the importance of having the parents ’ approval for jihad.may 17 , 1991 , @entity159 , @entity160 , the group and i began a special course in explosives			0
the morning exercise line - up begins at 6am ; jogging , fast - pace running , mountain climbing and special exercises			0
as you notice , most of the ideas i ’m dealing with now at the jihad level are practical and they were the same ideas but unorganised and not fully clear			0
perhaps , life ’s stress and order prevented from enhancing them practically or even from thinking about them ; such as caliphate and @entity178 principles.july 3 , 1991 , @entity179 , @entity180 , rather , we the explosives group , are in @entity179 now at the back line since last friday			0
airplane shelling , and one of the shells landed in the heart of the camp ; but praise @entity87 , no one was injured			0
continuous artillery shells , digging ditches , carrying rocks from the mountain , dirt , sweat and exhaustion ; a true mental relaxation , @entity87 willing and oh @entity87 ! july 7 , 1991 , @entity179 , @entity198 is sunday and the time now is perhaps 12.30pm.place : the big tent which houses more than l5 people			0
the planes are hovering around us ; they strike one time and other times they do n’t ; however the artillery shells are continuous.running to the ditches and face down on the ground , but i am relatively cool and do n’t run to the dugout and do n’t even go face down on the ground sometimes ; as a matter of fact , i do n’t know why			0
according to @entity216 , the personal diaries were taken by a former @entity6 intelligence official who worked with the @entity49 and @entity218 on @entity11 issues			1
the journals mention key figures in @entity11 including @entity2 and their contents have been used as evidence to hold some of the 160 prisoners in @entity9			1
@entity1 is believed to have written more diaries while he was being held by the @entity49 and has allegedly detailed his torture			1
he was taken to @entity9 in 2006 and remains there although he has never been charged with any crime			1
his diaries have become the property of the @entity231 - something which traumatised @entity1			1
in march 2007 , he told a tribunal that keeping his diaries from him was like ' kidnapping a child ' and said he asks ' 20 hours a day ' for their return			1
current leader : @entity3 is the head of @entity11 at the moment hierarchy : @entity11 leader @entity2 was above @entity1			1

@entity1 was captured in 2002
@entity9 prisoner thought to be @entity11 's third in command
the diaries start in 1990 and span the decade leading up to the 9/11 attack
