the rise and rise of @entity2 continues at pace			0
the 20 - year - old has been at @entity5 since he was seven , but before this season was barely known outside the walls of @entity8			0
six games into his season , though , and he could soon find himself on £ 50,000 a week , having started the campaign on £ 2,000 - a pay increase of 2,400 per cent			1
a £ 50,000 sum may seem the going rate for a centre back starting regularly for @entity5 , but has @entity2 really justified such a staggering pay rise ? @entity2 ( right ) looks set to be offered £ 50,000 a week to remain at @entity17 past this season the centre back currently earns £ 2,000 a week and his deal expires at the end of the season the @entity5 youth product ( right ) has appeared six times in the league under @entity25 @entity26 ( h ) lost 2 - 1 - @entity29 rating 6 @entity30 ( a ) 1 - 1 - 5 @entity31 ( a ) 0 - 0 - 5.5 @entity32 ( h ) won 4 - 0 - 6.5 @entity34 ( a ) lost 5 - 3 - 4.5 @entity35 ( h ) won 2 - 1 - 7 ( came on at 70 mins ) @entity25 has spoken glowingly about @entity2 and has been impressed by his dedication to improving himself - the defender , as reported previously by @entity29 , regularly puts in extra training sessions on days off			1
yet the fact remains that in the five games @entity2 has started this season he has not scored a rating higher than 6.5 from @entity29 's reporters			1
his highest rating has been a 7 - but that came in a 20 - minute cameo in the 2 - 1 win over @entity35			0
it must also be remembered that @entity48 - now a full @entity50 international and one of the best young players in @entity53 - left @entity17 when the club balked at his pay demands			2
@entity48 wanted a reported £ 20,000 a week and when he did n't get it joined @entity57 , where he has gone on to win two @entity59 titles but is still only on £ 23,000			1
@entity48 ( right ) left @entity5 after reportedly being refused wages of £ 20,000 a week and even at @entity57 , where he has become one of the most sought - after midfielders in the world , he earns just £ 23,000 a week @entity65 was recently rewarded with a new contract at @entity5 but he is paid a reported £ 30,000 a week @entity65 , who so impressed last season and was linked with a move to @entity69 , is only on a reported £ 30,000 a week			1
there will be those that say that no young player - regardless of how good they are - deserves to be lavished with such vast sums			0
others will say that , with @entity2 's contract due to expire next year , @entity5 had to splash out to keep him at the club			0
should @entity2 go on to become a regular for @entity5 for the next decade then £ 50,000 a week will seem a snip and a masterstroke by the club 's hierarchy			1
but , at present , it seems to be another example of @entity5 's apparent willingness to throw money around without concern			0
@entity2 ( left ) has not received higher than a 7 rating from @entity29 reporters so far this season the 20 - year - old has featured prominently due to @entity5 and @entity93 's defensive injury crisis this season by all accounts , @entity2 seems to a sensible young man who wo n't let the money distract him but with his potential sky - high wages now known the pressure will continue to increase on his inexperienced shoulders			1
any slip - up and that figure will be bandied about			0
@entity2 is not to blame for this , of course - @entity5 's paymasters ultimately sign off any deal and questions must be asked of them			2
but the centre back will have to attempt to go about his business and prove he is worth the cash , but should such a young man still finding his way in the @entity112 be under such intense pressure so soon ? @entity2 operates as a left - sided centre back and has looked assured despite being just 20 years of age you can follow them on @entity118 here			2
