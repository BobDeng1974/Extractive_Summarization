jet hiker @entity6 , 29 , from @entity7 , has seen 42 @entity3 states and more than 250 towns and cities on her journey , made possible by the kind nature of pilots she has encountered on her way			1
@entity6 said : ' as a travel writer , i 've been all over the world but i had n't seen much in my own backyard			1
i wanted to experience the @entity3 in a unique way and started brainstorming ideas			0
but the process of getting the flights is n't an easy one			0
she added : ' i spend hours and hours contacting people			0
i 'll go to the airports and tell people what i am doing and wait around - and sometimes it is days before i find someone heading the direction i am			0
' @entity43 away : @entity6 prepares for take - off in a @entity46 biplan @entity6 , from @entity7 , poses with a friend at @entity48 in @entity49			1
she has visited 42 @entity3 states and more than 250 towns and cities on her epic journey when she finds a pilot going her way , she relies upon the good nature of the pilots in the community to get her from place to place			1
she said : ' the pilots have an adventurous spirit as well , and many of them have hitchhiking stories of their own ' back in the day			2
' the other thing is that they love introducing people to aviation			0
it is their hobby and their passion so if they can show others a different side of aviation beyond the commercial airlines they jump at the chance			0
' one pilot told me he asks everyone around the office if they want to go flying with him - it creates a reason for them to go and might spark an interest in aviation with someone			0
' plane crazy : travel writer @entity6 with pilot @entity91 in @entity92 before taking off on another of her hitch - hiked flights going fly way ? @entity6 prepares for take - off on a flight from @entity98 to @entity99 @entity6 tries a spot of hang gliding in @entity102			1
when she finds a pilot going her way , she relies upon the good nature of the pilots in the community to get her from place to place @entity6 has been travelling non-stop since 2012 , apart from a few exceptions where she has run out of money and has found a job where she has landed			1
she said : ' this adventure is almost complete			0
i have eight more states to go before the next adventure begins			2
ambitious @entity6 said : ' i 've considered taking @entity117 global , by expanding to @entity119 , @entity120 , the @entity121 , and @entity122			1
' however , i would like to get my pilot 's licence first and take some time to plan and save money for such an undertaking			2
stowaway : aerial hitch hiker @entity6 pokes her head out of the storage area of one of the many planes she travelled on festival : travel writer @entity6 at @entity133 after hitching yet another free flight to @entity135 ice to be here : amber at the @entity138 in @entity139 ' in @entity3 , we have a long history with airplanes and a general love for flying within the community so it was a natural place for @entity145 to take off			1
' regulations and fewer pilot numbers will make it more difficult elsewhere , but i think it is still possible			0
there 's a huge world out there , and i do n't plan on staying still			2
' i think an organised ride - share system between pilots and travellers to cut costs on both ends could make this a reasonable option for travellers with a limited amount of time			2
' i definitely recommend visiting a local airport or flying club and seeing what the general aviation side is all about			0

@entity6 visited 42 states and over 250 towns on her epic trip
she relied *purely* on the kind nature of pilots she encountered on her way
she is now planning to get her own pilots licence and fly around the world
