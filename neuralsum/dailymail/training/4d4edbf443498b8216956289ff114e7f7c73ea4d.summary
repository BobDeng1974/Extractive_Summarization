on his eighth birthday he was tied to a tree , doused in petrol and set on fire			1
the inferno left @entity6 with third - degree burns to 99 per cent of his body			1
no - one expected him to survive			0
but in a story of staggering courage , @entity6 lived			2
he endured 200 operations and endless therapy to repair the burns			0
tragically , he was to die just weeks short of his 21st birthday from a cancer which doctors blamed on the original injuries			1
final statement : @entity6 is pictured shortly before his death in 2011 around the time when the statement was made where he accused @entity23 of sexual assault before : two pictures showing @entity6 as a young boy before he was attacked near his home on his eighth birthday in 1998 by a 13 - year - old @entity23 after years of such terrible suffering , @entity6 ’s premature death was to have one positive outcome in a harrowing 17 - minute video made just before he died , he named the man he believed had torched him in @entity34 , @entity35 , in 1998			1
and he also claimed that he had been raped by the same person , a 13 - year - old neighbour called @entity23 , two weeks before being set alight			1
the terrible act was , @entity6 alleged , a way of ensuring his silence			1
his accusations have opened the way for @entity23 , now a 27 - year - old convicted sex offender , to be charged with felony murder			1
the charge is only made for a criminal offence which has happened in conjunction with another crime			0
accused : a mugshot of the alleged attacker @entity23 @entity52 attorney @entity51 is changing the charges in order to be able to prosecute @entity23 as an adult , despite the fact that committed the crime as a juvenile			1
mr @entity51 also hopes that the additional accusations of sexual assault will not only explain the torching , but also explain why it took so long for mr @entity23 to be prosecuted			2
‘ it was done to prevent @entity6 from talking , ' @entity51 told the @entity64			2
' it provides the bridge that we needed for the delay , rather than saying we did n't have sufficient staffing or something else			0
' @entity6 was celebrating his eight birthday in 29th april 1998 when he met his neighbour @entity23 on a wooden path near their homes in @entity34 , @entity52			1
two weeks earlier , according to @entity6 ’s statement before his death , the pair had met in the same spot and mr @entity23 , then 13 , had overpowered the young boy and raped him			1
now he wanted him silenced			0
‘ @entity23 grabbed me by my shoulder and threw gas in my face , after that i do n't really remember anything , ’ @entity6 said in the video statement			1
the @entity86 reported that his mother @entity87 said during the trial : ' it was so hard to take in what my eyes were seeing			0
' all of his hair was scorched , and there was skin hanging around his ankles			0
' a little while later , i walked down to the tree where it happened			0
there was a perfect outline of @entity6 ’s body scorched into the bark of the tree			1
' @entity23 was not prosecuted for the crime , although police statements reveal that he was held in custody after he made statements only a person at the scene could have made			2
in 2001 , aged 16 , @entity23 was jailed for sexually assaulting an eight - year - old boy			2
@entity6 ’s resulting third degree burns on 99 per cent of his body led the young boy spent most of his life in a specialist unit at @entity115 in @entity116			1
the rehabilitation , which included over 200 operations and skin grafts , was excruciating , but his mother said he never gave in to self pity and anger			0
the @entity86 reported how one of the surgeons described how during the first few months at @entity126 , the little boy suffered nightmares , convinced that he was being burned again			0
homicide : @entity6 suffered third - degree burns on 99 per cent of his body , and the following 200 operations and skin grafts are what led to his rare cancer diagnose from which he died in 2011 but his haunted sleep was especially dangerous because if he moved about too much , he risked tearing his newly - grafted skin			1
‘ i grieved for a long time but after a while , @entity6 became the same happy - go - lucky child and life was good , life was liveable again , ' his mother @entity87 told @entity142 in march this year			2
mrs @entity143 said of her son 's decision to name @entity23 : ' he did it because was afraid that @entity23 might attack another child and that was @entity6 's motivation for giving that deposition			1
’ @entity150 died from skin cancer in april 2011 shortly before his 21st birthday			1
a medical examiner ruled that mr @entity6 ’s death was a homicide as the particular type of cancer he suffered from can only come from enduring skin grafts for serious burns			1
the 27 - minute long statement was made from his hospital bed in which he accuses @entity23 of sexual assault			2
as graphic pictures shown to the jury revealed the horrifying extent of the youngster 's injuries , many openly wept at the images			0
first step : @entity87 and @entity171 were awarded the biggest compensation in history , $ 150 billion , when they successfully sued @entity23 in a civil lawsuit last year his scorched skin was blackened , his eyelids had been burned off and his body looked like a charred patchwork			2
a judge had to order that a box of tissues was passed around the jury box as members gasped at the extent of the wounds the boy had miraculously survived , the @entity86 reported			0
they heard how the boy had to routinely endure skin grafts , which were then cut away , to allow the boy 's bones room to grow as it was too inflexible to allow movement , before eventually being stitched up again , it was reported			0
after each of the 200 operations , the @entity86 reported how @entity6 was ' stretched ' by braces to try and give his skin a little elasticity			2
because of these prolonged periods where he was strapped to braces , he had to learn how to walk time and time again			0
@entity87 and her husband @entity203 won a civil lawsuit against @entity23 in 2011 , awarding them with $ 150 billion , the biggest settlement in @entity208 history			0
attorney @entity209 says the punitive damage award is symbolic and the @entity211 , from @entity52 , @entity35 , expects none of it will be paid			0
at the time of the lawsuit mrs @entity143 told @entity216 : ' i was n't expecting it to turn out as well as it did			0
' it tells me that they understood that he was a precious human being and he did n't deserve what happened to him			0
' neither @entity23 nor any attorney appeared for him at the civil trial			0
after filing murder charges in september , @entity52 attorney @entity51 has now dismissed in and filed a new charge of felony murder @entity143 has said she supports dismissing the murder charge for felony murder : ‘ our lawyers see this is a strategic move , one that is moving in the right direction			1
