by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor the @entity3 on thursday limited the president 's power to fill high - level vacancies with temporary appointments , ruling in favor of @entity10 @entity9 in their partisan clash with president @entity12			1
the high court 's first - ever case involving the @entity16 's recess appointments clause ended in a unanimous decision holding that @entity12 's appointments to the @entity19 in 2012 without @entity10 confirmation were illegal			1
@entity12 invoked the @entity16 's provision giving the president the power to make temporary appointments when the @entity10 is in recess			1
problem is , the court said , the @entity10 was not actually in a formal recess when @entity12 acted			1
the justices rejected that argument wednesday			0
@entity47 @entity46 sen. @entity46 said thursday on the @entity10 floor that @entity12 clearly overstepped his constitutional authority			1
' no president in history had ever attempted to make recess appointments when the @entity10 said it was in session			1
... these illegal appointments represent just one of the important areas where president @entity12 has disregarded the law with his philosophy of " the ends justify the means " , ' @entity46 said			2
' we should all be thankful the @entity3 has reined in this kind of lawlessness on the part of this administration			0
' @entity46 declared that thursday 's ruling is ' the @entity3 ’s biggest rebuke to any president since 1974 , when it ordered president @entity71 to produce the @entity73 tapes			0
' @entity75 @entity74 sen. @entity74 piled on , insisting that ' the @entity16 gives the @entity10 powers the executive branch can not usurp			0
' ' our founders wanted a president , not a king , ' he blasted , ' and our @entity16 is written to protect against precisely the kind of overreach this president demonstrated			0
' justice @entity85 said in his majority opinion that a congressional break has to last at least 10 days to be considered a recess under the @entity16			0
neither house of @entity90 can take more than a three - day break without the consent of the other			0
the issue of recess appointments receded in importance after the @entity10 's @entity98 majority changed the rules to make it harder for @entity9 to block confirmation of most @entity12 appointees			1
but the ruling 's impact may be keenly felt by the @entity105 next year if @entity9 capture control of the @entity10 in the november election			2
the potential importance of the ruling lies in the @entity10 's ability to block the confirmation of judges and the leaders of independent agencies like the @entity19			2
a federal law gives the president the power to appoint acting heads of cabinet - level departments to keep the government running			0
torpedoed : @entity12 put two @entity121 -- former senior counselor to the secretary of labor @entity124 ( @entity125 ) and former @entity127 general counsel @entity126 ( r ) -- on the @entity19 unconstitutional ly , the @entity3 said still , the outcome was the least significant loss possible for the administration			1
the justices , by a 5 - 4 vote , rejected a sweeping lower court ruling against the administration that would have made it virtually impossible for any future president to make recess appointments			1
the lower court held that the only recess recognized by the @entity16 is the once - a - year break between sessions of @entity90			0
it also said that only vacancies that arise in that recess could be filled			0
so the high court has left open the possibility that a president , with a compliant @entity90 , could make recess appointments in the future			2
justice @entity149 , writing for himself , chief justice @entity151 and justices @entity152 and @entity154 , said he would have upheld the lower court 's reasoning			0
he said thursday 's decision means " the abolition of the @entity16 's limits on the recess - appointment power			0
" a recess appointment can last no more than two years			0
recess appointees who subsequently won @entity10 confirmation include chief justice @entity164 and justice @entity165 , @entity167 chairman @entity166 , two current @entity19 members and @entity170 director @entity169			1
former @entity172 ambassador @entity171 is among recess appointees who left office because they could not win a @entity10 vote			0
the case challenging the appointments was brought by @entity177 , a soft drink bottling company in @entity179 , @entity180			0
the company claimed an @entity19 decision against it was not valid because the board members were not properly appointed and that the board did not have enough members to do business without the improperly appointed officials			1
senator @entity46 said @entity12 's appointments were ' illegal , ' and claimed thursday 's decision was ' the @entity3 ¿ s biggest rebuke to any president since 1974 , when it ordered president @entity71 to produce the @entity73 tapes ' @entity177 prevailed in the @entity2 @entity192 , and two other appeals courts also had ruled against recess appointments			1
@entity12 has made relatively few recess appointments , 32 in his four - plus years in office , according to the @entity197			1
president @entity199 made 171 such appointments over two terms and president @entity202 filled 139 posts that way in his eight years in office , the research service said			0
but @entity12 was the first president to try to make recess appointments when @entity90 explicitly said it was not in recess			1
the @entity16 requires that the @entity10 and @entity105 must get the other 's consent for a break lasting longer than three days			1
at the end of 2011 , the @entity9 - controlled @entity105 would not give the @entity98 - led @entity10 permission for a longer break			2
the partisan roles were reversed during @entity199 's presidency , when @entity121 sought ways to prevent the president from making recess appointments			2
in fact , the very basis on which the justices decided the case — that the @entity10 can use extremely brief sessions to avoid a formal recess — was a tactic devised by senate majority leader @entity228 of @entity229 to frustrate @entity199 .			2

@entity12 appointed three *people* to the @entity19 in 2012 while the @entity10 was taking a break from regular business
the @entity10 had dragged its feet on the labor board *nominees* so @entity12 made ' recess appointments , ' declaring that the @entity10 was in recess
the @entity10 insisted that it was not officially in recess since it *convened* in ' pro forma ' sessions every three days
the @entity3 agreed thursday , saying the @entity105 ca n't *unilaterally* decide when the @entity10 is in ' recess '
