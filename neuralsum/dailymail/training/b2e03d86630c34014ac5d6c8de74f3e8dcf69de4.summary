wildlife experts believe that long term climate change could be leading to spiders setting up home in new areas , but that many people were mistaking the common house spider for a false widow			1
they are distinctive for their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns on their backs.in the borough in recent months			2
the so called ' outbreak ' of sightings has intensified with people spotting the creatures in their homes and gardens all over @entity10			1
@entity20 , 14 , was bitten at his home @entity53 on thursday evening by a spider that is believed to have got into his bedroom			2
he woke the following day with a small bite mark on his forearm but by the time he got home from school on friday his condition had worsened			0
mother @entity61 said : ' the whole of his forearm had swollen from elbow to wrist			0
@entity65 , 39 , of @entity66 in @entity10 , was bitten on his shoulder and wrist his arm started hurting and his hand went numb and , as a childhood leukaemia sufferer , his immune system is weak so he went to @entity73 ' we gave him an anti-histamine and paracetamol			0

@entity65 , 39 , of @entity66 in @entity10 , was bitten on his shoulder and wrist			0
his arm started hurting and his hand went numb and , as a childhood leukaemia sufferer , his immune system is weak so he went to @entity73 to be checked over and was put on a course of antihistamines , antibiotics and cream for the affected areas			0
spider experts say the animals only usually bite when threatened and if people are bitten they are best to treat the bites themselves and stop them from becoming infected			2
conservation officer @entity106 , who works at the @entity107 , called for calm over the false widow			1
he said : ' lots of people said they have been absolutely sure that the spiders they have seen are false widows , but theyâ € ™ re not at all			1
itâ € ™ s not that straight - forward			2
' the problem with sipders is that they are unpopular and not manypeople study them			0
' many of the " sightings " reported are probably not false widows at all			1
' i think long term , global warming could have led to an increase in the spider population			2
' but any warm winter weather we had last year was followed by a very harsh march			0
