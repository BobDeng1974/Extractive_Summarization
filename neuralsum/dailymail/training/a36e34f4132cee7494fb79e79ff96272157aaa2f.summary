by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is planning a world tour of football to refresh himself if the right job does n’t come up in the next few months			1
the former @entity6 manager , sacked after just ten months at @entity6 , has already had two offers from @entity9 clubs and three from abroad – but is looking to return to a @entity11 club			1
@entity1 is enthusiastic about the prospect of managing abroad if a good opportunity arises – but if not , he will use the time to broaden his horizons and travel to prepare himself for his next job			1
planning ahead : @entity1 , pictured here watching @entity17 's friendly against @entity18 in @entity19 , is keen to travel the world to learn more about football dejected : @entity6 failed to find their best form during @entity1 ' time at the helm nightmare : @entity1 endured a disastrous time in charge at @entity28 before being sacked in april ‘ i ’m getting ready to work again , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i do n’t know how i ’ll be in a few weeks time when pre season starts			1
it ’ll be the first time since i was 16 that i ’m not starting a pre-season			2
but if a job does n’t crop up which suits me , i ’ll travel			1
‘ so many players come out of @entity35 , i ’d like to go and watch what they do			2
there ’s more players from @entity39 playing overseas than any other country and more in the @entity11 than any nationality			0
so , there is a continual conveyer belt of them			0
is it their development ? is the raw talent just better ? and at the top level , any team you work for is going to have plenty of @entity35 , so it would be good to understand the culture they ’re from			0
‘ there ’s got to be something to learn from youth development in @entity35 , because if you get good young players you can build a club			2
you want to see where the good young players come from , their coaching and meet people involved in it - and that might help you sign them in the future			0
‘ i ’d also like to go and look at the @entity65			0
places like @entity67 and @entity68 have emerging leagues and are producing more players and i ’d like to see what they ’re doing in that part of the world			0
they ’re beginning to show signs of improving in talent development in a big way , as are the @entity77			0
i ’d just like to have a look around			0
’ wanted man : @entity1 has already received five job offers since leaving @entity28 talent factory : @entity1 wants to learn more about @entity82 and the production of superstars like @entity39 's @entity85 ( left ) @entity1 , who was in @entity19 on holiday last week and took in @entity17 ’s friendly match against @entity18 , says that he hopes his dismissal from @entity6 wo n’t stop major clubs from looking at @entity91 coaches again – and that he was even pleased by @entity93 ’ success last season with @entity95 , because it demonstrated that home - grown coaches can thrive			1
‘ the route through to the top for a @entity91 manager is a long process and maybe having a job abroad at some of the clubs and getting recognized for your work there , might be the way in the future , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ but i hope i wo n’t be the last one to be given a chance to manage on of the top ones			0
‘ @entity93 has come in and with the time he ’s been given has been able to turn round @entity95 and i think it ’s really important for @entity91 mangers that he ’s done that			0
' i ’ve spent most of my career in rivalry with @entity95 but part of me was glad , because @entity93 was given the opportunity to go in there and change things around and because of that @entity95 have got their strategy in place and a good future			2
’ role model : @entity1 has been impressed with the work of @entity93 at @entity95			1

@entity1 was sacked as @entity6 manager in april
the @entity130 spent less than a season at @entity28 before being shown the exit door
@entity1 has received five job offers since leaving @entity6
he will look to travel and learn more about football if the right job does *n't* come up soon
