a man who passed out at a friend 's party woke up with more than a hangover when he discovered a guest had tattooed his back			1
while @entity7 , 24 , slept , his mate @entity6 , also 24 , inked the words ' if found face down call an ambulance ' on his back , using a @entity12 kit			1
@entity7 , from @entity13 , near @entity14 , only discovered the prank the following day after looking in a mirror - and said his partner went ' absolutely bonkers ' when she saw it			1
@entity7 awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back @entity7 ( centre ) was tattooed by his friend @entity6 ( right ) who was taking revenge on his mate after @entity7 had attempted to tattoo @entity6 with an at - home kit and it went horribly wrong @entity6 said he carried out the practical joke on @entity7 , who had passed out at a @entity30 , in revenge for a tattoo @entity7 did on @entity6 's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong			1
starting off with a design for a lizard , @entity7 tried to turn it into a cross , then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty , permanent mess on @entity6 's leg and causing his partner to go ' bonkers '			1
so when he saw @entity7 passed out at the party , @entity6 - who is a father of three - said he ' could n't resist ' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate 's back			1
amazingly , the prank has n't harmed the pair 's friendship - and the childhood friends , who are both having their tattoos removed , still see each other every day			1
but @entity6 does admit to regretting the prank once he had sobered up			2
he said : ' the opportunity presented itself and i could n't resist			0
' i did n't feel guilty when i was doing it because i 'd had a few drinks myself but i was quite remorseful afterwards and asked everyone not to tell @entity7 who had done it			2
' @entity7 , who is a support worker , said although it was a shock , he has managed to see the funny side			2
' i was pretty astonished when i looked in the mirror - i thought , " i did n't go to bed with a tattoo " ' , he said			0
' i did n't know when i 'd got it and no one would tell me who 'd done it			0
but since i found out it was @entity6 it has n't affected our friendship at all - we still see each other every day			1
it 's just practical jokes between mates			0
' @entity6 , also a support worker , added that he would advise anyone against at - home tattoos			1
' we had bought a @entity12 tattoo kit online and originally it was a well - intentioned exercise , ' he said			1
' then when it did n't turn out right it dawned on me this was forever and i was stuck with it			0
the pair are both getting their tattoos removed by laser technician @entity93 ( right ) and say the incident has n't affected their friendship ' @entity7 started off doing a lizard , then a cross , then some hands and a gun - he did an abomination of a job and every time he tried to touch it up it got worse			1
' when my partner saw it she went absolutely bonkers			0
if anyone is thinking of trying their own @entity12 tattoos - i would just say , do n't			2
' the pair are now getting their tattoos removed with laser treatment - carried out by technician @entity93 at the clinic she runs based at her @entity14 home			1
@entity93 , 47 , who started her business four years ago , says she has seen an increasing number of people seeking help after getting @entity12 tattoos			2
' we are not against tattoos here at all , but @entity12 ones can lead to problems , ' she said			2
' sometimes people come in and it 's scarred because they have pushed the needle too far in and dragged it			0
' you can also get infections or what we call ' blow out ' when the needle is pushed in so deep there is nowhere the ink can go and it just spreads , looking like a bruise			0
' no laser can get that out when it happens , you just have to get a cover - up tattoo			0
' surprisingly enough @entity93 would also advise on going to professional rather than doing your tattoos yourself			0
' we 've definitely seen an increase in people coming to us with home made tattoos since we opened			0
' we 're just trying to say to people if you want a tattoo done , go somewhere professional , do not use one of these diy kits			0

@entity7 only noticed the tattoo on his back the following day
it was the handy work of his best friend @entity6
@entity6 was getting revenge for a botched @entity12 tattoo @entity7 had given him
