by @entity0 published : 04:41 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 4 january 2013 angry : top food writer and broadcaster @entity1 has launched a legal challenge after inspectors gave her hotel @entity7 and @entity8 just one star out of five for food hygiene as a top food writer and broadcaster , @entity1 is used to giving advice to struggling hoteliers desperate to revive their fortunes			1
but it seems the 62 - year - old could do with some advice of her own after her rural hotel restaurant received a damning critique			1
the former star of @entity21 on @entity22 has been left furious after @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , was given just one star out of five for food hygiene			1
it means ' major improvement necessary ' and has prompted mrs @entity1 , who co-owns the hotel with her husband @entity31 , to begin the process to get a judicial review of the decision			1
she presented three series of @entity21 giving tips and advice to struggling hoteliers in a bid to turn their fortunes around			0
@entity41 , which carried out the inspection on november 26 , said that as a result of the rock - bottom rating certain dishes were removed from the menu			1
changes were also made to the layout of the kitchen and how food was handled			0
mrs @entity1 , who used to run the @entity51 and goose in @entity52 , and @entity53 , said in a statement : ' we strongly disagree with the score we have received from the environmental health officer for @entity41 , removing our previous maximum score under the scheme			1
' to validate our view we have taken independent advice from one of the @entity64 's leading food safety experts			0
' he has carried out his own assessment of the @entity68 's report and firmly believes that it neither follows , nor accurately reflects , @entity71 guidelines			2
' she added : ' as someone who has worked in the hospitality industry for nearly 30 years , i fully accept there is always room for minor improvements			0
criticism : the former star of @entity21 on @entity22 hit out after @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , pictured , was given the devastating rating critic : @entity1 is pictured during an episode of @entity84 ' however , part of the problem appears to be that the boundary between taking food safety very seriously , as we always do , and being allowed to cook top quality local ingredients in the way our customers want , is being irrevocably blurred			1
' we have made every effort to resolve our dispute with the food safety team as swiftly and amicably as possible , but remain unable to agree with their approach , and so we have commenced the first stage of a judicial review action to allow a court to determine the fairness of the inspection and the rating			2
' poor : this image shows the food hygiene rating given to the @entity107 in november a council spokesman , referring to the @entity24 inspection , said : ' the appeal against the rating considered fully the independent advice sought by the @entity23			2
' our decision to confirm the rating was based firmly on the national guidelines set by the @entity115 and we also took independent advice			2
' we believe that our decision was a correct one and will defend it strongly if it is legally challenged			0
' the 21 - bedroom @entity7 and @entity8 , which is co-owned by the @entity118 and @entity119 , calls itself more of a ' restaurant with rooms ' than a hotel			0
the venue says its restaurant , called the @entity125 , is a lively bistro serving ' decent , unpretentious food '			0
the controversy in @entity24 comes after the historic @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity25 , threatened legal action after it was listed as a zero - star establishment on the @entity71 's website last year			1
it was re-inspected on december 19 and rated ' generally satisfactory ' with three stars .			0
