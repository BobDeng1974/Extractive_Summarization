in 2016 , a team of engineers will attempt to smash the land speed record by reaching more than 1,000mph in their bloodhound supersonic car ( @entity5 )			1
the project has been seven years in the making and has been a dream of former @entity10 pilot @entity9 since he set the current record in 1997			1
now , it has moved a step closer to reality - with the hybrid rocket engine them car will use being fired for the first time			1
the firing lasted for a predefined 16 seconds , producing a maximum thrust of 30 @entity31 ( or 3 tons )			0
a hybrid rocket combines a liquid oxidizer ( hydrogen peroxide ) and a solid fuel ( synthetic rubber ) to allow the rocket to be throttled or shut off , a feature beyond the capabilities of traditional solid rockets			1
the test burn lasted for 16 seconds and produced 30 @entity31 ( @entity31 ) or 3 tons of thrust			0
temperature inside the rocket reached 2,200 degrees celsius and 1,200 degrees in the plume , more commonly known as the massive jet of flame shooting out the end			2
the test , conducted by the bloodhound team 's rocket partner @entity23 tests the first in a series of large hybrid rocket motors at their @entity56 test site			2
the supersonic car will use one @entity23 hybrid rocket in high speed testing scheduled for 2015 and a cluster of three rockets in its 1,000mph ( 1,609 km / h ) campaign in 2016			1
this is addition to main the main engine , which is normally found powering a @entity64 , weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs ( @entity66 ) - or nine tonnes of thrust			1
the two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power , or the equivalent to 180 @entity72 cars			0
the test firing of the rocket was an unprecedented success , the team said			0
the firing lasted for a predefined 16 seconds , producing a maximum thrust of 30 @entity31 ( or 3 tons )			0
the rocket will also be used to power spacecraft			0
@entity23 ’s work with hybrid technology has been supported by the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) since 2010 , notably under its @entity84 ( @entity84 )			2
driver @entity9 , 51 , is hoping to break the world land speed record when he tests the £ 10 million rocket - powered vehicle next year			1
the upper chassis is made of strong , but lightweight aluminium , onto which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets			0
the lower chassis , below the jet , is made of aluminium and steel , and houses the @entity23 hybrid rocket			1
the pencil - shaped car will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long , 6ft ( 183cm ) in diameter , and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed			1
chief engineer @entity101 said : ' for us at @entity5 , it is immensely exciting , this is the motor that 's going to take us to break the record			1
' for us this is a really important test			0
the @entity5 stands for ‘ @entity108 ’			2
the vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly - fitted jet engine and a rocket			1
it is set to travel at 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h )			2
the slender body , 44 feet ( 14 metres ) long , keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic			2
the pencil - shaped car ( concept pictured ) will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long , 6ft ( 183cm ) in diameter and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed			1
the upper chassis is made of strong , but lightweight aluminium to which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets it weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower			2
that ’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a formula 1 starting grid put together			0
in the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record			2
the current land speed record stands at 763.035mph ( 1,227.985km/h ) , set by former @entity10 pilot @entity9 - who will also drive the bloodhound - back in 1997 in the @entity140			1
the project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph ( 321km/h ) at @entity146 ’s @entity145 next summer			2
the team will then head to @entity149 and attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier on a purpose - built 12 - mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016			1
during the record - chasing run , @entity5 will cover 12 miles ( 19km ) in two minutes , exerting an acceleration force of almost @entity155 , and peak deceleration force of @entity157 on the driver			1
the current land speed record stands at 763.035mph ( 1,227.985km/h ) , set by former @entity10 pilot @entity9 - who will also drive the bloodhound - back in 1997 in the @entity140			1
earlier this year , designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle ’s futuristic cockpit			2
it has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave , and two different resins			0
it has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total			0
the project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph ( 321km/h ) at @entity146 ’s @entity145 next summer			2
the team behind the @entity5 also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) to zero			1
after the car reaches its top speed , air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph ( 260km/h )			2
breaking to this speed is done at a constant @entity184 - equivalent to going from 60mph ( 95km/h ) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds			0
at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute			0
attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car - like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this , so the team needed a new approach			1
instead , they switched to steel rotors			0
in tests , these could withstand temperatures of up to 850 ° c ( 1,560 ° f ) , and be used again			0
the next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced			0
sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core , which provide additional strength			0
at its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers , but measures just 0.9 - inches ( 24mm ) thick			0
the cockpit structure weighs 441lbs ( 200kg ) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet , rocket and racing car engine			1
it has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph ( 1,609kph ) , as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension			2
it will also carry ballistic armour to protect wing commander @entity9 should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds			1
the cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet , a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket ’s oxidiser pump , which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast			1
wing commander @entity9 will wear a specially made in - ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control			2
the team behind the @entity5 also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) to zero			1

the first attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier will take place in @entity149 on a purpose - built 12 - mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016 after the car reaches its top speed , air brakes and parachutes will slow it to 160mph ( 260km/h )			1
breaking to this speed is done at a constant @entity184 - equivalent to going from 60mph ( 95km/h ) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds			0
this last stint to zero is where the problem lies , however			0
even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute			0
attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car - like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this , so the team needed a new approach			1
instead , they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer @entity285			0
in tests these proved much more promising , withstanding temperatures of up to 850 ° @entity290 )			0
they even survived to such an extent that they can be used again			0
the next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced			0

the @entity5 is designed to go over 1,000mph ( *1,60km/h* )
car will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long , 6ft ( 183cm ) in diameter and weigh 7.5 tonnes
will use three of the hybrid rockets when it makes record attempt in 2016 along with @entity320 jet engine that normally powers a @entity64
driver @entity9 is hoping to hit speeds of up to 1,000mph ( 1,609km/h )
