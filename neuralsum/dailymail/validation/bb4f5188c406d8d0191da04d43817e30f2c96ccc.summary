the world ’s leading authority on the detection of banned performance - enhancing drug @entity3 in blood says a particularly low level of the substance is explicable only by renal damage or doping — a conclusion that raises fresh doubts over historic alleged doping by a current staff member at @entity13			1
as @entity16 reported last week , court documents in @entity15 show that an expert at a 2001 criminal trial concluded from a blood sample taken from a @entity21 rider , @entity20 , that he had taken artificial @entity3			1
the toxicology reports that led to testimony that @entity20 had taken @entity3 were compiled by two doctors whose evidence was challenged in court , but the court ruled it was good evidence			2
@entity20 has been a ‘ directeur sportif ’ with vital strategic responsibilities at @entity13 since 2011 and was a 27 - year - old rider with @entity21 team @entity30 when the sample was taken during the @entity32			1
@entity35 , former director @entity36 and @entity20 ( second right ) with @entity37 in 2012 - a 1998 sample from @entity39 showing an @entity3 level of 0.7 was used to convict traffickers in a @entity15 court the technical paperwork relating to his blood tests carried out by an expert , @entity45 , showed an @entity3 level of 0.7			1
@entity13 say their own unnamed experts , paid by them to examine documents unearthed by the @entity49 , have exonerated @entity20 of any wrongdoing , for reasons unspecified			1
@entity20 was never on trial and therefore did not have an opportunity to challenge the medical evidence ; rather his tests and testimony were used to convict @entity3 traffickers			1
@entity20 never disputed the reading of 0.7 but denied ever taking @entity3			2
now @entity64 , who invented the first ever blood tests to detect @entity3 , has told the @entity49 : ‘ the only known causes of such a low @entity3 level in blood [ 0.7 ] is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys can not sustain normal production of natural / endogenous @entity3 and / or the current and previous administration of recombinant [ banned ] @entity3			1
’ directeur sportif for @entity71 signed a police statement in 1998 saying he did not contest the @entity3 finding			1
he said he believed it may have been due to ‘ great exertion ’ , which expert @entity64 @entity13 did not answer our specific questions but gave this statement : ‘ this relates to events over 15 years ago that were contested and well documented at the time			1
we looked carefully at the information provided to us by @entity16 last week , including a review by a panel of three independent world - class experts			0
nothing here , including the new medical opinion , causes us , or the experts , to change our view			1
there is no proof of @entity94			0
@entity20 continues to maintain his innocence and to be a valued member of @entity13			1
' the @entity49 has asked @entity20 and @entity13 if @entity20 had renal damage at the @entity32			1
@entity64 was lead researcher on the pioneering @entity3 tests , first implemented at the @entity99			2
these tests have morphed into the athlete biological passport and since been adopted by a number of international sporting bodies			0
@entity64 also currently sits on the biological passport panel of cycling ’s world governing body , the @entity108			0
in 1998 , @entity20 signed a police statement saying he did not contest the @entity3 finding , but said he did not know why it was so low			2
he told police he believed it may have been due to ‘ great exertion ’			2
@entity64 says : ‘ i do n’t think that “ great exertion ” is a plausible explanation for such a low @entity3 level			1
’ @entity116 1 : this is an extract from the court expert ’s summary , specifically in relation to @entity20 ’s blood and his @entity3 level , saying in her opinion this was a result of the ‘ feedback ’ phenomenon where the body is now producing such low levels of @entity3 as it had recently stopped taking artificial @entity3			1
it finishes by saying : ‘ @entity131			0
’ no 2 : an extract from the official court summary of the case showing expert witness @entity135 had concluded @entity3 use by four of the @entity30 riders , from blood samples			1
@entity20 was one of those four			0
@entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 were the others			0
no 3 : a summary of an interview , quoting @entity20 ’s own words , following a police interview on 3 dec 1998 , signed by @entity20 to show it is an authentic and accurate representation of what he had said in that interview			0
he says : ‘ i do not dispute this rate [ of 0.7 ]			1
on the other hand , if this rate is so low , it can result from lots of things other than stopping taking @entity3			0
at least that is what i ’ve heard from lawyers and doctors			0
i believe these people all the more because i ’ve never taken @entity3			0
‘ for my part , although i am not a doctor , i think that this perhaps comes from the fact this is due to an earlier great effort			0
’ no 4 : the vital readings that mrs @entity45 found in @entity20 ’s blood			2
the key figure here is the @entity3 reading in the body : 0.7			0
this was an abnormally low reading			0
last week we revealed that @entity16 had unearthed a collection of documents , never published or reported before , containing detail about the involvement of @entity20 , @entity13 ’s @entity180 , in one of cycling ’s major doping scandals			1
last week ’s revelations came after months of in - depth investigations			0
when we passed our findings to @entity13 , they refused to act			0
most major cycling teams , including @entity13 , have employed former dopers in the past three years - either as riders , coaches , doctors or all three , and there is no rule against this , but @entity13 have a ‘ zero tolerance ’ ( @entity201 ) policy , meaning that if past doping comes to light , that person must leave			2
several @entity13 staff have left after confessions since 2012 , but not knaven			0
question 1 the world ’s leading blood expert on @entity3 , @entity64 , has examined the paperwork from @entity207			2
@entity64 invented the first blood tests to detect @entity3 and sits on the biological passport panel of the @entity108			2
he says the testing @entity45 did on @entity20 ’s blood remains credible , concluding : ‘ the only known causes of such a low @entity3 level in blood is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys can not sustain normal production of natural / endogenous @entity3 and / or the current and previous administration of recombinant @entity3			1
’ did @entity20 have renal damage at the @entity220 in 1998 ? if not , what is his own explanation for that @entity3 reading , which he did not contest as accurate in a signed police statement in 1998 ? question 2 @entity20 ’s urine from july 28 1998 showed irregular levels of a banned drug , cortisone			1
in signed contemporaneous statements he said he ‘ did not contest ’ the presence in his samples of numerous substances , cortisone included			0
his explanation was he did n’t know how they got there			0
would @entity13 today , with a zero - tolerance policy , accept the rider ’s explanation ‘ i do n’t know how it got there ’ as a valid defence ? question 3 who are the three ‘ independent world - class ’ experts cited in @entity13 ’s statement of march 7 who say the court documents are no proof of doping ? question 4 the evidence provided last week by the @entity49 , and studied by these experts , was accepted as valid in a criminal court case where three defendants were given prison sentences in verdicts , never appealed			1
on what specific , scientific basis did these three experts reject this evidence ? question 5 @entity35 said on @entity258 ’s cycling podcast last week that the experts , paid by @entity13 , did not know @entity20 ’s name when analysing the papers			2
is it true the experts did n’t know the papers related to @entity20 ? ( his name appears across the papers ) if so , why not ? question 6 knaven explicitly told police in 1998 he had no medical conditions requiring treatment with prescription drugs , yet admitted use of one prescription drug , @entity272 — a blood thinner — and tested positive for another , @entity275			1
the latter is used by heart patients			0
@entity20 said in 1998 he ’d never heard of it , but now admits he used it			0
why the apparent contradictions ? question 7 @entity13 say they were unaware until last week of the contents of the police statements relating to @entity20 from 1998 and of various findings during that tour , including products in his room and system			2
you now know about the court documents in @entity207			0

the @entity16 revealed @entity15 court documents show an expert at a 2001 criminal trial found @entity21 rider , @entity20 , took artificial epo
knaven has been held the role of ‘ directeur sportif ’ at @entity13 since 2011
his employment comes in spite of @entity13 **'s** ' zero tolerance ' policy
@entity13 **'s** unnamed experts exonerated @entity20 of any wrongdoing
@entity3 expert @entity64 told the @entity49 : ‘ the only known causes of such a low @entity3 level in blood [ 0.7 ] is either due to significant renal damage *...* or the current and previous administration of recombinant [ banned ] epo ’
@entity13 said the new medical opinion does *n't* change their position on @entity20 , who maintains his innocence and is a valued member of @entity13
