@entity1 mp @entity0 says he was warned against naming @entity2 at the home affairs select committee senior politicians warned a @entity1 mp against challenging former @entity6 home secretary @entity2 about a dossier detailing allegations of child sex abuse			1
@entity0 claims he came under ‘ pressure ’ from several people , including a current conservative minister , not to name @entity2 in front of a @entity15 committee			1
amazingly , mr @entity0 was even warned he could be responsible for @entity2 ’s death if he was subjected to the stress of becoming embroiled in a public row			1
mr @entity0 who has carried out his own investigation into child abuse by the former @entity22 mp sir @entity21 , said there was a culture of ' move along , nothing to see here '			2
at an appearance in front of the home affairs select committee last week , mr @entity0 revealed that @entity2 had been sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles between 1983 and 1985 by @entity33 mp			1
the @entity1 mp said he believed politics was the ' last refuge of child sex abuse deniers ' and repeated his call for a @entity40 - style inquiry into historical paedophile allegations			0
lord @entity2 said in a statement later that he was handed a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ by mr @entity33 in november 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation			1
but mr @entity0 claims he was warned off putting @entity2 ’s name into the public domain in connection with the files said to contain details of a vile paedophile network in @entity54			1
writing in the @entity55 , he said he was approached by a current government minister and urged not to name @entity2			1
‘ as i was i was making my way from the @entity58 on monday night after a late vote a @entity6 minister stepped out of the shadows to confront me			1
‘ i 'd never spoken to him before in my life but he blocked my way and ushered me to one side			0
‘ he warned me to think very carefully about what i was going to say the next day before the @entity67 when i 'd be answering questions on child abuse			2
’ mr @entity0 did not name the @entity6 minister , but said he was told : ' i hear you 're about to challenge @entity2 about what he knew about child sex abuse			1
’ he was told it would not be a ‘ wise move ’ to name @entity2 , adding : ‘ it was all put to bed a long time ago			2
' mr @entity0 added : ‘ we looked at each other in silence for a second			2
i knew straight away he was n't telling me this out of concern for the man 's welfare			0
there was no compassion in his voice			0
’ the @entity87 mp believes similar conversations were being held across @entity54 , as allegations swirled over the handling of child abuse claims in @entity92 and @entity93			1
he claimed members of the home affairs committee were ‘ paid similar visits ... phone calls had been made ’			1
lord @entity2 said in a statement later that he was handed a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ by @entity6 mp @entity33 in november 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation mps who had previously indicated they would ask him who he thought knew about the @entity106 child abuse ring at the notorious @entity107 in southwest @entity108 were ‘ suddenly silent ’ , mr @entity0 added			1
to his surprise , when he confirmed that he had been put under pressure ‘ to keep quiet about suspected child abusers ’ no further questions were asked			0
he said the @entity104 did not need to ask here the pressure was coming from ‘ because they all knew ’			0
he also claimed police officers feared political interference			0
' among the higher echelons of party politics , where the real power resides , my impression is that there is little appetite to confront the abusers in their midst , ' mr @entity0 said			2
the mood is defensive , the approach is dominated by silence			0
' move along , nothing to see here , ' or ' what 's the point in raking all that up old boy ? ' is the attitude i have seen time after time			0
' he said he was visited by police officers ' to discuss an investigation into a current parliamentarian accused of horrific child abuse '			0
he said the police asked him : ' did i think it was likely that their inquiries would be met by political interference			0
' he went on : ' i looked at them in utter disbelief			0
how can the police put a cabinet minister behind bars for lying about speeding points but be worried they could n't properly investigate someone for child abuse ? ' the incident spoke volumes about the mindset that pervades politics			2
this kind of obstructive , ' look the other way , sweep it under the carpet ' thinking threatens to drag politics to new depths of public hate			0
