by @entity0 @entity1 forecast : rising property prices will kill off the middle classes within 30 years and create a vast ' impoverished ' proletariat , @entity2 has warned rising property prices will kill off the middle classes within 30 years and create a vast ‘ impoverished ’ proletariat , a government adviser has warned			1
@entity2 , who is also a fellow of the @entity9 think - tank , said home ownership will be beyond the means of many of today ’s children , leaving them at the mercy of rising rents			1
he predicted that by 2045 , the average house price will reach £ 1.2million , meaning only the very rich will be able to afford a property			1
it would leave @entity20 with a ‘ tiny elite and a huge sprawling proletariat ’ who have no chance of ‘ clawing their way out of a hand - to - mouth existence ’ , he said			2
speaking at the @entity28 in @entity29 , mr @entity2 said that the time of @entity20 being a nation of home owners was heading into decline			1
he said the traditional middle classes would need three or four jobs just to be able to pay soaring rents			2
and while in the past the middle classes have been characterised by their love of culture to foster self - improvement , their new harsh lives will leave little time to pursue these interests			2
‘ the really scary thing is if in the next 30 years house prices rise as much as they have done in the last 30 years , then the average house in @entity20 will cost £ 1.2million , ’ he said			1
‘ we cheerled the rise of property prices not realising that it would destroy if not our own lives , but the lives of our children			2
‘ the place where this is heading is a strange society with a tiny elite and a long struggling , straggling line which is the rest of us , a new proletariat , who will be in hock to @entity61 ‘ we wo n’t own our own homes , we wo n’t be able to afford it			0
‘ it will constrain our dreams and constrain the dreams of our children			2
it ’s a new kind of economy where there are no middle classes at all			0
out of reach : mr @entity2 , who is also a fellow of the @entity9 think - tank , said home ownership will be beyond the means of many of today 's children , leaving them at the mercy of rising rents ( file picture ) ‘ nobody in society will have the kind of space in their lives , space in their homes , space in their careers for any kind of culture at all , because we will have three or four jobs to make ends meet			1
‘ i think it will impoverish society , make it more intolerant and make it more difficult to live			0
’ mr @entity2 was a member of the @entity98 ’ federal policy committee and was commissioned to write a report into access to public services by the government , which was published last year			1
criticised : mr @entity2 also attacked @entity104 for abandoning the @entity105 , which set banks ' mortgage boundaries yesterday he attacked @entity104 for abandoning the @entity105 , which set boundaries on how much banks could lend for mortgages			1
but he admitted that although the mechanism kept house prices low in the 1970s , it was unlikely that today ’s buyers would accept having to wait for a long time to get a mortgage			1
instead , he said a radical solution is needed whereby new homes are sold at their initial price for 100 years			0
mr @entity2 added that the dissatisfaction of the middle classes was already showing , and had led to a rise in popularity for parties such as @entity125			1
‘ you saw this huge revolt			0
i think what happens when you suppress the dreams of the middle classes is you get rather peculiar and very dangerous political movements beginning to emerge , ’ he argued			0
‘ that does n’t forgive people voting in the neo-fascists but it does somehow explain it			0
‘ very unequal societies are very inflationary societies and in the end it drives out those other degrees in society until it becomes very flat and very desperate			0
‘ the middle classes have to wake up to prevent it happening and to create a political movement that will do it			0
i do n’t think @entity125 is it			0
‘ you could say that it does n’t matter and that a more classless society would be a good thing			0
‘ i think if there is no place in the middle where anyone can go to claw their way out of a desperate hand - to - mouth existence then that condemns us all to a precarious existence , because there is no ladder			2
