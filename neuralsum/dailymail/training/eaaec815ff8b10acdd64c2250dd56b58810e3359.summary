they are the most celebrated @entity2 platoon in history , a band of men who changed the course of television comedy , if not actually the course of the war			2
but here they are as we never saw them at the time – @entity14 , out on manoeuvres in the wilds of @entity17			1
in a rare photographic record , cast members of the legendary series are shown mixing with locals in the fictional seaside town as they record episodes that will later delight audiences around the globe			1
but the backdrop is not exactly the coastal front line against @entity30 ’s planned invasion during @entity31 do n’t tell ‘ em , @entity32 , but it ’s the countryside around @entity34 in @entity35 , where most of the filming took place			1
@entity66 , the leader of the society , was often called on to provide extras for scenes and recalls that his actors were usually paid £ 10 per day they posed for pictures with the cast , went to parties with them , enjoyed dinner dates together after appearing as extras in dozens of episodes – and occasionally kept the stars supplied with liberal quantities of alcohol			2
now , as filming is about to start elsewhere on a big - screen remake of the comedy classic , the @entity82 – membership 1,400 and rising – has turned the clock back nearly half a century to the days when @entity47 and his fearless men first invaded the inland market town			1
@entity90 , who co-wrote the series with @entity92 and lived in neighbouring @entity93 , asked the chairman of the local amateur dramatic society in the late 1960s to assemble extras for the series			1
‘ i quickly became very popular , ’ @entity66 , now president of the @entity98 , told the @entity99 yesterday			2
‘ when we started to be paid , i became even more popular			0
' i drafted in extras from all sorts of places – the drama society , the golf club , friends , my wife … even my parents featured in one episode			0
’ in total , hundreds of people were involved , including an entire @entity114 troop and the local @entity115			0
taking it easy : @entity44 has a cigarette break between shots at @entity57 @entity119 , who played @entity120 @entity41 , relaxes in a chair in @entity122 , @entity34			1
while the series was set in the fictional coastal town of @entity17 , most of the filming took place in @entity35 @entity128 , who played private @entity129 , is pictured on set			1
@entity131 will take on his part in a new film adaptation @entity128 , wearing what appears to be a fireman 's uniform , sits on a bench in @entity34			1
these images are all that survives to document the @entity34 filming , as the @entity141 either ditched or lost the other records mr @entity66 , now 79 , entertained the cast one day at a party in his house , which appeared in some of the backdrops			1
( the retired chartered surveyor ’s wife @entity147 recalled : ‘ they drunk us out of whisky and gin and everything else , but we did n’t mind			0
’ ) mr @entity66 continued : ‘ they all signed our visitors ’ book			0
they were charming company but they did n’t pull punches			0
@entity44 was playing my piano and complained it was a rotten piano and was out of tune			0
it seemed to get better after a couple of gin and tonics though			0
’ ' @entity48 [ who played spivvy private @entity49 in the first series ] was constantly chatting up all the girls			2
@entity119 [ @entity41 ] had what mr @entity66 described as ‘ a rather cracking wife who used to insist on sunbathing in bikinis ’			0
he added : ‘ they were all lovely people			0
most of the days involved us sitting around for long periods while they set up a shot , so some days were long and boring			2
but it was great fun , and quite an exciting time for our little community in @entity34			1
’ virtually all the best loved episodes feature @entity35 extras in non-speaking parts or background scenes			1
in ‘ @entity186 ’ , the platoon is challenged to a cricket match by the @entity189 wardens , who have recruited a top class bowler to their ranks ( played by @entity194 cricketer @entity193 )			0
mr @entity66 played short leg to @entity196			0
‘ @entity193 bowled one ball , which was all he was required to do , ’ said mr @entity66			0
‘ he then spent the rest of the day regaling us with some very doubtful stories about his career in @entity203 cricket			0
’ at ease , soldier : @entity206 , who played private @entity207 , is pictured during filming for the @entity209 episode at @entity210 on the @entity211 in @entity35 expert camouflage : @entity213 , dressed as chief @entity214 , plays around on set during filming in @entity216			1
the crew used @entity219 's house ( pictured ) for filming , and while she was only paid £ 10 , mr @entity213 agreed to take her and her husband out for dinner @entity66 , the head of a @entity224 society near to where filming took place , became a popular fixture on set			1
he recalled that @entity48 ( pictured ) ' was constantly chatting up all the girls ' @entity46 , in full @entity47 uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips , signs his name for two young autograph hunters in ‘ @entity238 ’ , the platoon is chosen to help test the @entity237 ’s latest secret weapon			1
some of the filming took place in @entity219 ’s garden in @entity216 , a small village south of @entity242			1
‘ there was n’t much happening in @entity216 in the 1970s so it was quite something , ’ she said yesterday			0
‘ i think we got paid £ 10 for a day ’s filming , which did n’t exactly change our lives			2
but @entity213 [ @entity214 ] came round to take me and my husband out for a meal , which was lovely			0
they were such pleasant people to be with , not uppity at all			0
’ mrs @entity219 , 65 , still has a @entity253 snapshot of herself with cast members , including one that shows her arm in arm with the ‘ delightful ’ @entity44			2
and her house is firmly on the @entity14 map – ‘ every now and then we get a coachload of fans coming by on tour , ’ she said			1
the series ran for nine years from 1968 and pulled in 18million viewers at its peak			2
it is still being shown on mainstream tv and attracts new generations of followers every year			0
the photographs are the only known record of the @entity34 days , however – the @entity141 is said either to have ditched or lost any it might have had in its archives , along with the list of filming locations			1
between takes on the set of @entity278 , @entity213 and @entity279 - who played verger @entity281 - are seen reading a paper ( left )			2
@entity206 and @entity128 are seen waiting for the camera to roll on the set of @entity287 's car mr @entity66 recalled that @entity44 was once playing his piano , but ' complained it was a rotten piano and was out of tune ' @entity206 , outside @entity292 pub in @entity93			2
@entity14 ran for nine years from 1968 and pulled in 18million viewers at its peak @entity119 stands with a local girl in @entity295 , @entity93			1
the images were collected by the @entity82 secretary @entity297 , who went to locations where the series was filmed and asked for snapshots they were obtained by @entity82 secretary @entity297 , who spent nine years researching precise locations for a companion guide to the series			1
he traced many of those who allowed tv crews to use their land , property or services , and collected snapshots they took at the time			0
the prints are now part of the society ’s display of recreated sets , vehicles and memorabilia at @entity320 in @entity321 , @entity35			1
one shows @entity46 , in full @entity47 uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips , signing his name for two young autograph hunters			2
another shows actor @entity48 in 1970s civvies as he relaxes with two clearly delighted am - dram stars in the making			0
@entity34 being 50 miles from the sea , @entity332 , @entity333 and @entity334 were used for some locations ( how else might a @entity339 u-boat crew get to @entity17 ? ) ; and @entity34 station became @entity17 station whenever required			1
the closest the cast got to the heavily guarded wartime @entity343 was @entity344 , where filming was relocated during a 1973 @entity141 strike			2
@entity119 sits with a local boy on the set of @entity349 , filmed at @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity35 @entity90 , the producer and director of @entity14 , is pictured in @entity34 on the set of @entity354 @entity128 and his wife @entity355 sit next to @entity206 , as he does crossword			1
@entity206 and @entity55 would see who could finish the word puzzle first @entity206 takes on another crossword in while sitting in @entity122 , @entity34 , during filming for @entity354 ‘ the appeal of @entity14 is that it ’s simple fun , ’ mr @entity297 said			1
‘ it ’ s not vulgar or nasty – it ’s just clever , straightforward , timeless humour … with brilliant writing and a magical cast that just came together so naturally			2
’ only @entity55 – immortalised as ‘ stupid boy ’ @entity32 – survives as one of the seven main platoon characters			0
but reinforcements are on hand			0
as revealed in the @entity99 last week , seven new actors are lined up for a big screen remake of @entity14 , with @entity374 , from @entity375 , playing capt @entity47 , and filming is expected to start soon in @entity377 , @entity203			1
the proposal has provoked anger from some fans			0
perhaps surprisingly , mr @entity297 , who has met the directors , is not among the dissenters			0
‘ they know what they ’re dealing with , ’ he said			0
‘ they fully understand that it ’s a national treasure			0
’ of the original cast , only @entity55 ( second right ) survives today , as filming begins on a movie re-make of the television series the cast of the new @entity14 film - including @entity395 as @entity32 ( fifth right ) and @entity131 as @entity129 ( far right ) - are pictured lined up on the first day of filming in @entity396 , @entity203			1
