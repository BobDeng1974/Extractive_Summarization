the @entity0 have confirmed @entity2 's £ 10million live world tour will go ahead next month with @entity3 at the helm alongside fellow presenters @entity6 and @entity7			1
a @entity9 spokesman said they will fulfil the series of gigs which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide - but added that the shows will be stripped of all @entity0 branding and content and billed as @entity3 , @entity7 and @entity17			1
that means the shows , which will take place in venues as far afield as @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 as well as the @entity24 , will not be able to use clips from the show or feature @entity27			1
the move comes less than a week after @entity3 was dismissed from the @entity0 for an ' unprovoked ' attack on a @entity2 producer			1
a @entity9 spokesman said : ' so as not to disappoint the thousands of people around the world who have already purchased tickets , @entity9 has agreed with our joint venture partner brand events that the remainder of the tour can continue			2
' these events will not however feature any @entity0 @entity2 branding or content			1
' we believe this is a sensible approach in the circumstances			0
' some of the dates have already had to be rescheduled and tour organisers believe it may not even make a profit by the time those costs have been taken into account			0
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity3 at the @entity56 show in @entity57 , @entity58 - the 2015 tour starts in @entity21 next month and fans have paid between £ 35 and £ 200 for tickets a spokesman for @entity63 said : ' this is a great solution for the fans			1
we 'd like to thank our ticket holders for their continued patience			0
' the fans are the most important people to @entity3 , @entity7 and @entity6 so we 're delighted to be able to say " we 're still coming "			1
' we 're sure it 'll be something you wo n't want to miss. ' the move is likely to spark rumours that the three men intend to team up to continue their careers together after @entity3 's exit from the corporation , but sources close to the tour say it is just a matter of fulfilling commitments to the fans			1
the future of the show 's other presenters - @entity7 and @entity6 - is unclear , with both men 's contracts running out today			1
contract discussions with the show 's stars were put on hold after the @entity0 suspended @entity3 when it emerged he had been involved in what was initially described as ' a fracas ' with producer @entity94			1
contract discussions with the show 's stars were put on hold while the @entity0 suspended @entity3 when it emerged he had been involved in what was initially described as ' a fracas ' with producer @entity94 earlier today @entity2 producer @entity99 was forced to deny reports he has quit the hit show in the wake of @entity3 's sacking			1
an email sent to @entity2 staff congratulating them on making ' one of the most iconic programmes in tv history ' was published yesterday and widely reported as a resignation statement			0
in it , he said : ' our stint as guardians of @entity2 was a good one , but we were only part of the show 's history , not the whole of it			1
those two words are bigger than us			0
' but today mr @entity99 , whose friendship with @entity3 dates back to their school days , said the email was ' not a resignation statement , and nor was it meant for public consumption '			2
he said : ' it was a private note of thanks to 113 people who have worked on the show over the years , but clearly one of those 113 is a bit of a tit , because they shared it with a website			0
@entity3 was looking cheerful yesterday ( pictured ) as he picked up a new car ' i do n't get this modern obsession with sharing , linking , forwarding , retweeting ; whatever happened to a private moment ? ' and if i were to resign , i would n't do it publicly , i 'd do it old school by handing in my , er , notice , to someone upstairs in @entity146 ' i work behind the camera and i would n't presume for one moment to think people are interested in what i do			2
now , everyone back to work			0
' a spokeswoman for the show said : ' @entity99 's email was intended as a heartfelt message to people who had worked with him and @entity3 , to recognise the fact that with @entity3 leaving it was the end of an era			2
' it was not a farewell but a thank you to people who have been important to the show over the last 12 years			0
it was bringing down the curtain on the @entity3 era , not announcing his own departure			0
' police are still investigating threats to kill @entity0 director - general @entity172 , which are thought to be linked to his decision to axe @entity3			1
@entity174 confirmed it was looking into allegations made when mr @entity172 confirmed he would not be renewing @entity3 's contract because of his unprovoked attack on mr @entity94 at a @entity179 hotel			1
the @entity180 reported that the director - general and wife @entity181 have been under 24 - hour guard since the threat was received			0
a @entity174 spokesman said : ' police in @entity187 are investigating an allegation of threats to kill			0
' the allegation was reported to police on wednesday march 25			0
no arrests have been made			0
' mr @entity172 , former chief executive of the @entity193 , took over the £ 450,000 @entity0 post in april 2013 to replace @entity195 , who left the corporation in the wake of the @entity199 sex abuse scandal			2
last wednesday , he announced that @entity3 , a popular but divisive figure during his time at the hugely successful @entity203 motoring show , would not be retained , saying ' a line has been crossed ' and ' there can not be one rule for one and one rule for another '			2
mr @entity94 had his lip split by @entity3 in a 30 - second assault on march 4 and took himself to hospital with his injuries			2
he was also verbally abused by the former @entity2 presenter			0
@entity3 reported the incident to the @entity0 five days later and was suspended on march 10			2
