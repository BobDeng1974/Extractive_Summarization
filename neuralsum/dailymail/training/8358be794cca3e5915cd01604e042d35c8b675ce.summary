by @entity0 for @entity1 former @entity3 striker @entity2 does n't think @entity4 is the man to fire the @entity5 to title glory			1
the @entity8 forward arrived in a £ 30 million deal from @entity10 this summer and boss @entity11 hopes he 's the man to help end a 10 - year @entity13 title drought			1
but speaking to the @entity14 on @entity15 , @entity2 claims @entity11 has n't addressed the deficiencies in his squad - namely a reliable goalscorer and midfield powerhouse			2
leading the line : @entity2 doubts whether @entity4 will solve @entity3 's problems he said : ' @entity4 is a fantastic signing but i do n't think the problems have really been addressed			1
' i like the @entity26 signing but he 's going to take a bit of time to bed in			0
the two main problems were the centre of the pitch and a noted goalscorer and they have n't addressed that problem			2
' if you struggled against the top boys and you do n't address the problems , then you ca n't expect a different result in my opinion			0
' as well as @entity4 , @entity11 has brought in @entity40 in for £ 12 million from @entity41 and @entity43 defender @entity42 arrived for £ 10 million from @entity44			0
big ambitions : @entity4 ( right ) and team - mates @entity47 and @entity48 will be hoping to prove @entity2 wrong this season on the ball : @entity4 ( right ) takes on @entity50 on his @entity13 debut new kid on the block : @entity4 is expected to be a key player for @entity3 this season as they chase glory but attempts to sign @entity59 winning @entity61 midfielder @entity60 has failed and @entity2 , who also played for @entity62 and @entity63 , said the @entity5 are still short in the middle of the park			1
and @entity2 questions whether the former @entity10 man , who scored 21 goals in all competitions for the @entity69 last season , has the physical attributes to lead the line in @entity74 football			1
he said : ' coming from @entity10 is different to playing in the @entity13			0
' @entity4 is going to get a lot more physical pressure against him , so i do n't see him as being a centre forward who can take the hits			0
' i do n't see him being that central striker			0
' @entity3 verdict : @entity2 takes on @entity82 during his time with the @entity5 and will follow his former club keenly this season @entity2 scored 59 goals in 228 games for the @entity5 from 1988 until leaving for @entity63 in 1995			2
@entity4 played the full 90 minutes as @entity3 beat @entity87 2 - 1 on the opening day of the @entity13 season .			1

@entity4 arrived in a £ 30 million deal this summer
the @entity8 @entity59 star made his @entity13 debut in the 2 - 1 win over @entity87
@entity4 , *25* , scored 21 goals in all competitions for @entity10 last season
but former striker @entity2 does n't think @entity3 manager has addressed problems from last season - a noted goalscorer and power in midfield
