there are currently 1,400 potentially hazardous asteroids that could pass close to @entity2 , according to latest data revealed by @entity4			1
an image mapping the orbits of all the potentially hazardous asteroids ( @entity8 ) provides a graphic of the crowded cosmic activity			0
these asteroids are considered hazardous because they are fairly large - at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size			1
this graphic shows the orbits of all the known @entity15 ( @entity8 ) , numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013			0
these are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large ( at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size ) , and because they follow orbits that pass close to the @entity2 's orbit they are classified as @entity22 because they follow orbits that are considered to pass close to the @entity2 's , at or 7.5 million kilometres			1
however , @entity4 claims that being classified as a @entity8 does not mean that an asteroid will impact the @entity2			2
scientists there claim that none of the asteroids shown in the image are considered a threat over the next 100 years			2
the group is planning to continue to track these asteroids so that their orbits can be refined and more precise predictions made of their future close approaches and impact probabilities			0
the dots represent a snapshot of the population of near - earth asteroids ( @entity42 ) and potentially hazardous asteroids ( @entity8 )			2
positions of a simulated population of @entity8 on a typical day are shown in bright orange , and the simulated @entity42 are blue			0
@entity2 's orbit is green as part of this effort it is working on the development of an infrared sensor that could improve its asteroid tracking capabilities , dubbed the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) sensor			1
the @entity55 space mission will also search for the most favourable destinations for future exploration by humans or robotic missions			2
this means that when searching for near - @entity2 objects with optical telescopes , the data collected can be deceiving			1
depending on how reflective the object is , a small , light - coloured space rock can look the same as a big , dark one			0
asteroids do , however , always emit infrared radiation			0
this image shows the differences between orbits of a typical near - @entity2 asteroid ( blue ) and a potentially hazardous asteroid , or @entity8 ( orange )			1
phas are a subset of the near - earth asteroids ( @entity42 )			0
they have the closest orbits to @entity2 's orbit , coming within 5 million miles ‘ when you observe a space rock with infrared , you are seeing its thermal emissions , which can better define the asteroid 's size as well as tell you something about composition , ’ said @entity85 , an author on the paper and principal investigator for @entity4 's @entity89 and @entity55 missions			1
asteroids emit most of their radiation at infrared wavelengths near about 10 microns ( 0.0004 inches ) , which humans perceive as heat			0
there is also relatively less radiation from stars and galaxies at these wavelengths , which simplifies detection of faint moving objects			0
once launched , the space - based telescope would be positioned at a location about four times the distance between @entity2 and the moon			2
from this lofty perch , @entity55 could observe the comings and goings of near @entity2 objects , including @entity8 , without the impediments such as cloud cover and daylight			1
the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) is a mission proposed to @entity4 to find potentially hazardous asteroids			1
the mission will use a new sensor , called the @entity55 chip , that has more pixels and better sensitivity than previous generations of infrared sensors			0

these asteroids are classified as ' hazardous ' because they are at least 140 meters in size and could come within *4.7* million miles of @entity2 's orbit
however , none are considered a threat over the next hundred years
@entity55 mission will track these asteroids and other near - @entity2 objects
