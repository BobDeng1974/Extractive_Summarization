a happy young couple who drowned in the raging torrent of a flooded river after going to wash their dogs died accidentally , a coroner ruled today			1
recently engaged @entity6 and @entity7 , both 25 , had taken their five pets close to a weir on the @entity11 , near their home in @entity13 , @entity14 , on september 26 last year			1
torrential rain had turned the river into a raging torrent , the inquest into their deaths held at @entity18 ’ @entity15 heard			1
they were last seen ' laughing and joking ' and washing the dogs on the edge of the water around 4.30pm			0
@entity6 and @entity7 died after going to wash their dogs afer taking them for a walk the body of miss @entity6 , a stable - hand who had a three - year - old daughter , @entity31 , was found downstream from a half - empty shampoo bottle at around 5pm later that day			1
the body of mr @entity7 , a carpenter who intended to turn professional as a boxer was found hours later partly submerged and trapped against a fallen tree in the river			1
no drugs or alcohol was found in either bodies , both were fit and healthy and there were no abnormalities to suggest either could have fainted or passed out and fell in the river			1
a pathologist concluded miss @entity6 died from ' dry drowning ' which can take the form of the trachea detecting water in the system causing it to close to prevent further fluid going into the lungs			1
mr @entity7 ’s lungs were filled with water			2
recording her verdict , @entity57 , deputy coroner for @entity14 , ruled both deaths an accident			1
ms @entity57 said : ' there ’s no evidence as to how @entity6 and @entity7 have entered the water			1
' there ’s no evidence as to why , and for us to guess would be mere speculation			0
they were a happy - go - lucky couple prior to this incident			0
' the most likely cause is that they have fallen into this river or gone into this river and the river has taken over and they have drowned in that raging , powerful torrent			0
they drowned close to a weir on the @entity11 , near their home in @entity13 , @entity14 ' they have entered that water and they have not stood a chance			1
they had no idea what a dangerous position they were in by being that close to the weir			0
' mr @entity7 's mother , @entity91 , said earlier that day her son told her he intended to go with miss @entity93 with their dogs , two jack russells , two retrievers and a whippet to wash them by the river			1
@entity101 , in a statement to the hearing , said she was walking her own three dogs in the area and could hear a ' loud roar ' from the water so decided it was too dangerous to let her own dogs off the lead			0
ms @entity101 said the river had broken its banks in parts			0
she saw the young couple on the edge of the weir adding : ' i could see them talking and laughing with each other , washing and rubbing the dogs			0
' miss @entity6 had a three - year - old daughter and worked as a stable hand @entity124 , another witness said he saw two of the dogs ' appear to struggle ' against the ' very strong ' current while in the river before managing to get out			1
@entity129 , from @entity130 , was alerted by another dog - walker to something in the water and spotted the body of miss @entity6 but there were no signs of life			2
' the river was very , very fast , the power coming from that would be immense , ' he told the inquest			0
teacher @entity142 took his own dog to the same area when he saw four of the couple 's dogs and thought it ' strange ' the owners were not with them			0
he also saw a half empty bottle of shampoo on the ground before being alerted to miss @entity6 ' body in the water on a shingle bank a few hundred yards downstream			2
' i could see it was a female with long hair and i had no doubt she was dead , ' he said			0
the coroner asked him : ' had someone fallen into the river that day , what chance would they have of surviving ? ' ' none , ' he replied			1
the coroner continued : ' a fit young man , capable swimmer ? ' ' no , ' mr @entity142 replied , ' no chance			2
' the inquest heard that around an hour after miss @entity6 's body was found her family alerted police that she had gone to the river with mr @entity7			1
but it was only at 9.09pm that the @entity173 was called , finding his body in the river just after midnight			0
but the coroner said a police helicopter had been used in the search with heat - seeking equipment but there were no signs of life			0
and mr @entity7 's body did not have injuries to his arms and hands normally associated with someone clinging to a rock or branch in the hope help is on its way			2
' there were no injuries of that nature , ' ms @entity57 added			0
' i 'm satisfied that he died quite quickly after entering the water , ' she added			0
' it is scant consolation that the delay in recovering @entity7 would not have saved him in my opinion			2
' the coroner added she would be writing to the @entity204 , which owns the land near the river , the local council and the government authorities to take steps to improve signs warning of dangers near the riverbank .			2

@entity6 and @entity7 , both 25 , found dead in river near @entity13
