@entity0 has revealed that @entity1 and @entity2 will build @entity4 's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the @entity6			1
the long awaited $ 6.8bn deal to replace the @entity8 and end reliance on @entity11 's soyuz craft was revealed at the @entity12 , where launches will take place from 2017			1
' i 'm giddy today , i 'll admit , ' @entity0 administrator @entity15 said as he made the historic announcement @entity0 hopes will spark an explosion in private space activities			2
@entity0 revealed today it is one of two craft selected to begin shuttling astronauts to the @entity6 in 2017			2
the @entity31 will at first be used to take astronauts to the @entity6 , pictured			0
however , @entity1 also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as @entity37 's inflatable habitats , which will be launched in the future @entity1 's design would be launched into space using the @entity43 rocket built by the @entity44 , a venture of @entity1 and @entity46 it will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations that rocket uses a @entity11 - built @entity53 engine , which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with @entity11			1
' from day one , the @entity57 made clear that the greatest nation on @entity59 should not be dependent on other nations to get into space , ' @entity0 administrator @entity56 said at the agency 's @entity12 in @entity63			2
' thanks to the leadership of president @entity66 , the hard work of our @entity0 and industry teams , and support from @entity71 , today we are one step closer to launching our astronauts from @entity4 soil on @entity4 spacecraft and ending the nation ’s sole reliance on @entity11 by 2017			1
' turning over low - @entity59 orbit transportation to private industry will also allow @entity0 to focus on an even more ambitious mission – sending humans to @entity83			0
' the two @entity85 ( @entity86 ) contracts are designed to complete the @entity0 certification for human space transportation systems capable of carrying people into orbit			2
once certification is complete , @entity0 plans to use these systems to ferry astronauts to the @entity6 and return them safely to @entity59			0
' today we do n't know who will be the first commander - but we know is will be a major achievement for our nation , ' said @entity15			0
under the deal , @entity1 will be given $ 4.2bn and spacex $ 2.6bn			1
@entity0 hopes it will spur private development in space			0
' ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that 's the vision of a commercial space industry , ' said @entity15			2
the contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one @entity0 astronaut aboard to verify the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system can launch , maneuver in orbit , and dock to the space station , as well as validate all its systems perform as expected			1
once each company ’s test program has been completed successfully and its system achieves @entity0 certification , each contractor will conduct at least two , and as many as six , crewed missions to the space station			0
these spacecraft also will serve as a lifeboat for astronauts aboard the station			2
" we are excited to see our industry partners close in on operational flights to the @entity6 , an extraordinary feat industry and the @entity0 family began just four years ago , " said @entity130 , manager of @entity0 's @entity131			2
" this space agency has long been a technology innovator , and now we also can say we are an @entity4 business innovator , spurring job creation and opening up new markets to the private sector			0
' the agency and our partners have many important steps to finish , but we have shown we can do the tough work required and excel in ways few would dare to hope			0
' the companies will own and operate the crew transportation systems and be able to sell human space transportation services to other customers in addition to @entity0 , thereby reducing the costs for all customers			0
the craft will replace the @entity8 following its retirement			0
the final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of @entity159 on july 21 , 2011 , bringing about the end of the 30 - year @entity161			0
earlier this year @entity1 took a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle			1
the aerospace giant completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the @entity6			0
the multibillion - dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months , given escalating tensions with @entity11 over its annexation of the @entity175 region of @entity176			0
@entity177 , vice president and program manager for @entity1 's commercial space exploration programs , said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design , but got ' excellent ' feedback from @entity0 during the review last month			1
@entity1 's @entity186 will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations from 2017 , it was revealed today			1
' from a technical standpoint , the review went very well , ' he said			0
' to the best of my knowledge we ’re the only @entity199 competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance , ' he said			0
@entity177 said , measured in mass , the @entity1 design for the cargo module was 96 - percent complete at the time of the review , while its design for the crew module was 85 - percent complete , two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design			1
he said the critical design review marked a major step for the @entity1 program			1
' you 've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you 're going to be able to meet those requirements , ' he said			0
@entity1 remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017 , @entity177 said			1
@entity1 's design would be launched into space using the @entity43 rocket built by the @entity44 , a venture of @entity1 and @entity46 that rocket uses a @entity11 - built @entity53 engine , which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with @entity11			1
he said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles , if necessary , although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher			1
since the @entity8 was retired in july 2011 , the @entity4 has relied on @entity11 to get its astronauts into orbit			0
but through their @entity131 , @entity0 has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft			2
next generation : @entity2 says the shuttle will provide a less expensive way to connect to the @entity251 @entity1 has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new crew @entity254 ( @entity186 - 100 ) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years			1
the capsule is funded by @entity0 as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft @entity1 ’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the @entity267 ( @entity268 )			1
they unveiled the new commercial interior of its @entity268 next - generation manned space capsule , showing how people other than @entity0 astronauts may one day travel to space			1
this is the first time they have made the design of the interior public			0
@entity1 and partner @entity37 highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for @entity0 , while @entity37 showcased a full - scale model of its @entity285 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in			1
' we are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential customers - beyond @entity0 - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior , ' said @entity292 , former @entity159 commander and current @entity1 director of crew and mission operations for the @entity131			1
engineers from across @entity1 leveraged the company 's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule 's interior			1
the capsule , interior view of a prototype pictured , will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit			0
it is in direct competition with @entity2 's manned dragon capsule and @entity315 's @entity314 space plane , all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space ' @entity1 's teams have been designing award - winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation , ' said @entity325 , regional director of sales and @entity326 for @entity327			1
' designing the next - generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression			0
a familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with @entity59			0
' two companies will now receive contracts from @entity0 to develop manned vehicles as part of the @entity131			2
the first is @entity2 , the company that seemingly came from nowhere a decade ago and has now flown the unmanned @entity24 spacecraft to the @entity6 three times on its successful falcon 9 series of rockets			1
they are in the process of developing a manned version of the @entity338 ( mockup pictured above ) that can take a crew of seven into orbit , with rumours suggesting it may be unveiled this month with a view to launching its first crew as early as next year			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , with a rich heritage in space exploration is building the seven - seater cst - 100 capsule			2
however , the latest announcement sees @entity315 , which is constructing what some regard as the true successor to the @entity8 , lose out			0
known as the @entity314 ( test vehicle pictured below ) , this ‘ mini-shuttle ’ of sorts will launch upright on top of a rocket , taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding back to @entity59 at the end of its mission			2
@entity314 with testing already underway , @entity314 is expected to undertake its first mission into space for the first time in 2017 on an @entity43 rocket .			2
