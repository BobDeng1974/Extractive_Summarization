@entity3 was camping at @entity4 in @entity5 when he came across the well - worn camera lying on the shore			1

the most recent video on the lost @entity0 showed the suspected owner ( pictured ) surfing in early january @entity3 found the scratched and worn camera on the shore while camping at @entity4 after taking it home with them and hooking it up to a computer , he and a friend searched the contents in an effort to locate the owner			1
the most recent video showed a young man catching a wave on his surfboard to which the @entity0 appeared to be attached			0
but just as he stands , the camera is seen tumbling off the surfboard and into the ocean before it sinks to the sand			0
the device ( left ) is then seen falling off the board after being knocked by a wave and sinking to the ocean floor ( right ) he believes its owner was in @entity41 after identifying some of the buildings in the last video ' it 's 60kms roughly straight from where it was dropped to where i found it and they do n't float , ' mr @entity3 said determined to find the owner and hand him back the expensive device , which contained over 70 videos , mr @entity3 and his friends managed to identify the skyscrapers in the background as belonging to the @entity41 skyline			1
' if i lost something like that and someone put in that effort , that would mean the most to me , ' mr @entity3 ( pictured ) said ' there 's a selfie of him on the board and in the background there 's building and we identified the buildings which we noticed were similar to the ones at @entity70 by using @entity71 , ' mr @entity3 said			2
