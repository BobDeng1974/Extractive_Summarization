under the settlement between @entity5 and @entity9 authorities , an estimated £ 5billion will be clawed back and handed to @entity15 over the next six years			1
the deal , signed in 2011 , was hailed as the largest tax evasion settlement in @entity5 history by chancellor @entity1			2

at the end of may they will be given a final chance to disclose their affairs and pay what they owe			0
if they do not , the money will be deducted automatically by @entity9 authorities and repatriated to the @entity5			1

it is estimated the move affects £ 40billion of assets held in @entity9 accounts by @entity5 investors			1
but tax campaigner @entity54 said : ‘ honest taxpayers are seeing criminals who broke the law being allowed to wipe the slate clean			0
’ ‘ they should be forced to pay penalties and hand back interest on money they have kept illegally			0
’ ‘ a similar agreement was rejected by the @entity66 parliament in november due to concerns that tax evaders would be able to retain their anonymity			0
