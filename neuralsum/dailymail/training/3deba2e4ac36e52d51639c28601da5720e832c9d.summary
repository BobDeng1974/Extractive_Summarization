this has been @entity2 's year , a 12 - month carnival of extraordinary forward play			1
it has been so good , even the man who does n't like him had to admit it			2
' yes , it was justified , ' @entity8 noted through gritted teeth			1
' much is made of the tensions that exist between @entity2 and @entity8 but this is not a rivalry to promote something			1
this antipathy is genuine and was evident from the moment they walked into a cavernous room in @entity21 's @entity20 for a pre-ceremony conference			2
@entity8 shuffled in next , ahead of @entity38 , in a grey hoodie and jeans , appearing as if he had just walked out of the classroom			1
there had been anxieties within @entity41 that @entity8 might not turn up for their big night and the @entity116 hardly gave the impression of wanting to be in @entity118			1
he scored a staggering 56 goals in 2014 but , unlike his rival , he will not look back with any kind of affection ; a failure to reach the last four of the @entity67 , a lost @entity126 final and recent simmering tensions at the @entity127 have knocked @entity8 from his pedestal			1
did he try and steal some of the spotlight back here ? perhaps			0
turning up for the actual ceremony in a garish purple tuxedo , @entity8 set tongues wagging with a cryptic answer to an innocuous question from the floor , hinting that the unthinkable – leaving @entity136 – might be possible			1
' i 'm not sure if i will go back to @entity138 one day , ' said @entity8			1
' i 'm not sure where i will be next year			0
i have always said i will end my career at @entity136 but as @entity2 said , only @entity140 knows the future			1
things can change in football overnight			0
' cue a raising of eyebrows			0
if @entity8 is sulking about @entity136 's current state , he did n't try to hide his emotions			1
when a video with a message from current coach @entity152 was shown , wishing him well for the award , @entity8 's face never cracked			1
@entity152 's words during the broadcast were equally cold			2
asked later to define his relationship with @entity152 , @entity8 bluntly replied : ' a manager - player relationship , just like any other			1
' @entity8 ( right ) , who finished second , arrived on the red carpet with his partner @entity159 the diminutive superstar is mobbed by fans on the carpet as he signs autographs @entity8 ( centre right ) captained @entity165 to the @entity126 final where they lost to @entity168 after extra-time the 27 - year - old ( centre ) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for @entity136 last season he was only third behind @entity175 and @entity176 in the 2005 @entity23 but @entity177 won a special prize via social media on monday night			1
@entity181 users mocked last season ’s infamous slip in the crucial defeat against @entity185 by awarding the @entity187 captain the ‘ 2014 @entity188 ’			2
clearly all is not well			0
@entity8 is not doing anything to quell the storm that is brewing around him and it did not go unnoticed that he voted for @entity191 in his top three coaches of the year			1
coming a week after he started following @entity185 on @entity194 , the conspiracy theories will run			0
this night , however , was about more than @entity8			1
it was a coronation of genius , which is what @entity2 is ; it should not be taken for granted what he has achieved or what he has become since he first came to our attention as a spindly yearling in the summer of 2003			1
@entity2 has matured into the most magnificent specimen			2
tall , powerful , with the neck of a boxer and the speed of a sprinter , his third @entity23 puts him up with gods such as @entity209 , @entity61 and @entity210			2
joining @entity8 on four will be a certainty if he holds his form			2
' this is one of the happiest nights of my life , ' he said shortly after coming off stage			0
it was a dream come true for me			0
i never thought i would win three gold balls			0
i want to win as many as possible			0
it 's hard , it 's very difficult to win			2
' a fourth ? it depends on what i am going to do during the season but this is going to give me motivation to work hard and get myself more and more and we will see if i am here next year			0
it 's more difficult to win it the third time than the first time			2
' during that early afternoon q - and - a , @entity8 , the outstanding @entity38 – a keeper who ' dominates absolutely everything ' , according to @entity239 manager @entity238 – and @entity2 had been asked which players from the past they would have most like to work with			1
none , out of fear of being received to be disrespectful , felt it appropriate to pick out an individual , so @entity2 played to the gallery and said it would be nice ' if us three guys ' could be on the same team			2
@entity8 then cracked and said @entity2 had been excellent			1
the internet can be a cruel place as social network users were quick to mock @entity177 third - placed @entity38 signs autographs on the red carpet ahead of the @entity57 on monday @entity38 ( left ) was a mainstay in the @entity239 team that won the @entity257 and @entity258 last season the 28 - year - old 's brilliant year was completed by helping @entity168 to win the @entity126 last summer so how did it feel to hear that from his greatest rival ? ' listening to @entity264 felt good , ' said @entity2			1
' listening to my team - mates and rivals say good things feels great			2
i think the same about him			0
maybe he has helped me become a better player			0
people mention that and it 's possible			0
' i hope he does that for many years to motivate me to win more things for the club and individual things too			0
this gives me motivation to be a better player all the time			0
i 'm really happy , it 's a fantastic moment in my career			0
' i want to carry on with more titles , collective and individual , and see if we are here again next year			0
' if they are , it will be the ninth consecutive year they have shared this particular stage			0
some may argue there is no fun in a two - horse race but this , beyond question , is a rivalry to be savoured			0
there may never be another like it			0
the trio were all included in the @entity296 which is selected by their peers 61 - number of goals scored in 2014 for club and country 9 - @entity2 ’s major honours in 2014 , including the @entity67 , @entity303 , @entity108 top scorer and the @entity23 142 million - @entity2 ’s social media following ... more than the population of @entity307 62 - number of minutes per goal scored in @entity108 1st - the @entity310 attacker is the first @entity66 player to win the @entity23 in two consecutive years 22 - number of assists he provided in 2014			1
