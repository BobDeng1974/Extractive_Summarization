they both looked super stylish in monochrome ensembles			0
@entity5 say of their collection : ' the season that lies ahead symbolises bravery and a carefree attitude			1

' a men 's collection features in similar hues and patterns , plus sportier jackets like parkas and bombers ' the @entity5 man redefines traditional formalwear with a sophisticated , smart selection of head - to - toe looks with details that make for a polished aesthetic whilst breaking the rule			1
' ' for the stylish men and professionals who are looking for the combination of exquisite fit and style ; high quality suiting and complimentary accessories embody an irreverent take on heritage prep that looks distinctly youthful			2
' while it can be straightforward enough to go luxe for @entity4 , the real test of a brand restyle must be @entity9			2
fabric is heavier , quality is more important to keep out chills , while keeping us cosy and comfortable - but clothes still need to look polished and sophisticated			0
@entity5 have turned out a simple and sophisticated collection with a punky edge - and some real hero pieces			1
a shearling coat , black sheer panel dress and leather panel pencil skirt will be versatile and wo n't ever age			0
a pair of nice - enough chunky boots were used a tad too much in terms of styling - a pair of slick stilettos or even sophisticated boots would have worked better with the bodycon dress			0
menswear impressed equally with fitted tailored suits done well and quirky styling with sporty coats			0
graphic knits paired with leather panelled pencil skirt ( l ) and electric blue knitwear and illusion outfit ( r ) palazzo pants and white pussy bow blouse toughened up with tartan biker jacket ( l ) and illusion coat ( r )			0
