by @entity0 next time a relative tells you they ca n't use a touchscreen , show them this video of a tortoise mastering the skill with ease			2
researchers trained four red - footed tortoises to use a touchscreen in return for strawberries and other treats			1
the animals were able to identify between red triangles and blue dots on the display , and even learnt which side of the screen to press			2
they began by teaching the animals basic touchscreen functions , using their noses			1
during the main experiment , the animals were trained to peck a red triangle in the centre of the touchscreen ( pictured ) the animals also were able to transfer this knowledge to a real - life , offline experiment			1
each trial began by showing the tortoise a red triangle on a touchscreen			1
once the triangle was touched , using the tortoise ’s nose , it disappeared and two blue circles appeared			1
if the circle on the designated side was chosen , both images disappeared and a reward was provided through an automatic feeder			0
if the circle on the incorrect side was chosen the tortoise was given a three - second time out during which the screen remained empty			2
the trial was then repeated			0
each correction trial started with the red triangle			1
the tortoise received correction trials until the correct choice was made			0
professor @entity64 from the @entity26 led the study , alongside researchers from the @entity67			2
the tortoises were called @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
during the main experiment , the animals were trained to ' peck ' a red triangle in the centre of the touchscreen			1
when two blue circles flashed , they had to peck either the circle on the left , or the one on the right , to get a treat			1
the correct side was programmed into the machine			0
the touchscreen was placed in a rectangular box with white plastic walls and a floor covered with grey , rubber lining			0
a feeder hole was positioned in the centre of the floor , just below the touchscreen			0
once the triangle was touched , using the tortoise ’s nose , it disappeared and two blue circles appeared ( pictured )			1
if the circle on the designated side was chosen , both images disappeared and a strawberry was dropped through an automatic feeder pressing the correct circle resulted in the feeder plate turning , which caused a strawberry to drop into the feeder hole			1
‘ in recent years red - footed tortoises have been shown to be proficient in a number of spatial cognition tasks , ’ explained the researchers			0
‘ the present study investigated the ability of the tortoise to learn a spatial task in which the response required was simply to touch a stimulus presented in a given position on a touchscreen			0
‘ the results show that red - footed tortoises are able to operate a touchscreen and can successfully solve a spatial two - choice task			2
’ the numbers on this chart reveal how many attempts the tortoise took to successfully complete each stage of the training			0
for example , during 10 sessions , @entity69 took 10 attempts to correctly press the triangle and the correct circle to receive a treat the training is significant because red - footed tortoises ( stock image pictured ) do n’t have a hippocampus - an area of the brain associated with learning , memory and spatial navigation			1
they instead use an area known as the medial cortex , which is associated with decision making in humans the training is significant because red - footed tortoises do n’t have a hippocampus , an area of the brain associated with learning , memory and spatial navigation , @entity150 told @entity156			0
they use an area known as the medial cortex , which is associated with decision making in humans			0
in a second experiment , the two tortoises applied their knowledge to a real - life environment			0
the researchers used two blue bowls and placed them in a similar position to the blue circles on the screen			1
the tortoises went to the bowl on the same side as the circles they had previously been trained to touch .			2

tortoises were trained to use the touchscreen by the @entity26
experts began by teaching animals to touch a red triangle using their noses
if they correctly touched the triangle , two blue circles would appear
they were then trained to touch either the blue circle on the left or right
each time they pressed the correct circle , they were given a strawberry
