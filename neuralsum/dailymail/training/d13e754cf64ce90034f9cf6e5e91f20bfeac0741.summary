trapped : the woman , named @entity19 , was about to use the toilet when she slipped and fell in her bathtub ( stock image ) but she could not reach the device leaving her stuck in the bath with no way of getting out			1
as the days passed , nobody came to her rescue and she was forced to drink water from the tap to survive			2
postal worker @entity29 delivered her mail after three days , she noticed something strange about the house			2
' i rang the bell but there was no answer			0
i found it strange because the front door and the window shutters were wide open , ' @entity29 told local daily @entity40			1
nonetheless her suspicions were not aroused sufficiently to raise the alarm and she went away			2
but when she returned three days later , she saw the door and windows were still open			1
the woman , in her 80s , lives by herself in the southern @entity7 town of @entity8 in @entity9 ( pictured , the town hall ) ' i said to myself ' that 's enough , there 's a problem here , ' she said			1
' i had n't done that route for very long but i knew an elderly woman lived there , so i went to the @entity56 to alert them			0
' @entity58 , mayor of @entity8 , took it upon himself to investigate the alert and borrowed a spare set of keys from a neighbour			1
upon entering the home he found @entity5 lucid but exhausted			0
' i was shocked by how clear her voice sounded , ' he said			0
firemen were called to assist her out of the bathtub upon which the octogenarian asked for nothing but a glass of milk with a teaspoon of sugar			0
and she lost none of her sense of humour when discussing the incident with a local magistrate , and told him she had ' learned [ her ] lesson ' about carrying her alarm with her at all times			2
' we forget about old people too often , ' @entity29 added			0
' i 'm proud i did what i did			0
who knows what would 've happened otherwise ? '			0
