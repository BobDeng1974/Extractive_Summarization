ouija boards are flying off the shelves			0
not in the super- natural sense — but the commercial one			0
the device , said to be a method of contacting the spirit world , is experiencing an unexpected renaissance			1
@entity7 reports that sales of the board are up 300 per cent , and it is threatening to become a @entity10 ‘ must buy ’			1
the culprit is @entity12 , and a new horror film titled @entity14			1
low - budget , lowbrow , it tells a familiar story — of kids dabbling with the ‘ other side ’ and coming off second best			1
the critics hammered it , but cinema - going teens , looking for something scary in the @entity24 season , loved it			2
being a canny company , @entity36 even helped finance the making of the film @entity14 , which has put new life into the business of talking to the dead			1
or not , depending on how one views this strange product , named after the @entity45 and @entity46 words for ‘ yes ’			1
to some , the ouija board represents a harmless form of enjoyment , a pretend - scary rite of passage for teenagers in search of thrills on a stormy night			2
but to others , churchmen included , it is a danger to be avoided , a trigger for psychological harm — or something worse			1
‘ it ’s like opening a shutter in one ’s soul and letting in the supernatural , ’ says @entity60 , a @entity61 vicar who has witnessed the dark side of @entity14			1
‘ there are spiritual realities out there and they can be very negative			2
’ players are told to sit around the board , each place two fingers ‘ lightly ’ on the pointer , and concentrate and he is adamantly opposed to the sale of @entity14 boards as toys			1
‘ it is absolutely appalling			2
i would very strongly advise parents not to buy @entity14 boards for children			1
’ the board itself is a simple thing , combining the letters of the alphabet and the numbers 0 to 9 with the words yes , @entity90 and @entity91			2
with it comes a planchette or pointer			0
players are told to sit around the board , each place two fingers ‘ lightly ’ on the pointer , and concentrate — before starting to ask questions in turn			1
‘ ask your questions slowly and clearly , ’ read the instructions			1
‘ and wait to see what the planchette spells out for you			2
’ the planchette then ‘ moves of its own volition ’ towards specific letters and numbers , according to @entity112 , proprietor of @entity113 ’s , a @entity115 bookshop specialising in the esoteric and the occult			1
‘ you feel it pulling away from the fingers			2
i ’m not dim — i have a phd — but it ’s not being pushed			0
’ an @entity37 invention , the board was a child of the spiritualist craze of the 19th century when mediums proliferated and seances were common in well - to - do homes			1
@entity14 took off again in the @entity130 , outstripping sales of @entity132 in its best year			1
cash - strapped teens made their own versions , using an upturned glass and paper scribbled with letters @entity14 took off again in the @entity130 , outstripping sales of @entity132 in its best year			1
cash - strapped teens made their own versions , using an upturned glass and paper scribbled with letters			0
but the age of the ouija board ’s innocence was about to end			0
the year 1973 saw the release of hit film @entity148 , in which a young girl takes to communicating with an unseen being by means of such a board			0
the being is a demon that goes on to possess her , before being exorcised by priests			0
@entity156 , author of the novel on which it was based , was inspired by a tale from the @entity160 , about @entity161			0
the teenager was said to have become possessed after playing with a ouija board for long spells , his spiritual infestation manifested by scratches , levitation and poltergeist activity			0
only after he was exorcised by catholic priests did he return to normal life			0
‘ the horror film shifted the focus of @entity14 to the idea of lost or malevolent spirits , ’ says miss @entity112			1
‘ that was where the culture of danger came in			0
once you have something said to be a way of consorting with malevolent spirits , you get the church involved			0
’ an @entity37 invention , the board was a child of the spiritualist craze of the 19th century when mediums proliferated and seances were common in well - to - do homes but the @entity191 does not doubt that the threat is real			1
‘ i would hugely recommend people not to have anything to do with the occult , ’ he says			1
‘ people find they are having strange dreams , strange things happening to them , even poltergeist activity			0
’ @entity201 is a @entity203 priest who specialised in exorcism before his retirement			0
interviewed a few years ago , @entity206 said he had dealt with a few teenagers who ‘ had been using @entity14 boards and had let the darkness into their lives ’			1
and the late reverend @entity211 practised as a minister of deliverance — jargon for an exorcist — for the @entity215 of @entity216 for half a century , advising @entity217 on the occult			0
he , too , saw the board as a source of danger			0
‘ a lot more people are dabbling in the occult and having seances , and that is causing a lot of problems , ’ he said in 2012			1
‘ in the @entity130 , the ouija board caused so many problems — people ending up in mental hospitals because of what they have experienced			0
’ the year 1973 saw the release of hit film @entity148 , in which a young girl takes to communicating with an unseen being by means of such a board an unseen force spelling out messages , he explained , may have sinister motives			1
‘ it may pretend to be your grandmother you ’re in contact with , but it might be something more evil that suddenly gives you some bad advice			0
’ on one occasion , he remembered , he was contacted by three dockers from @entity252 who had used a ouija board the previous evening			0
‘ they just sat there shaking , ’ he said			1
one person not scared by @entity14 is @entity258			2
he is a professor of psychology at @entity260 , @entity216 , and has written about them in his debunking study pseudoscience and the @entity263			0
like many sceptics , he believes the participants are themselves pushing the planchette to spell out messages			0
but , curiously , he does not attribute this to dishonesty			0
it could be entirely subconscious control , he believes			0
in support of this theory , @entity272 paranormal investigator @entity271 once blindfolded people taking part in a @entity14 session			2
the result was nothing more than gibberish — talkative spirits appeared to be silenced when the players could n’t see the board ’s letters			2
perhaps all this will leave only one section of @entity288 society taking @entity14 boards seriously this @entity10 — the retailers cashing in on the sales boom .			2

the device is said to be a method of contacting the spirit world
@entity297 is a result of new low - budget horror film titled @entity14
one vicar believes the game poses the risk of psychological harm
