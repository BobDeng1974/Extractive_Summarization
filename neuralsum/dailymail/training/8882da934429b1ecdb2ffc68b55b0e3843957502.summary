it only took about 10 minutes			0
' f * * * off @entity2 ' was the poisonous chant that cascaded down from the @entity5 fans in one corner , once they 'd finally all got in for this highly - charged @entity8 derby			1
303 appearances , 57 goals , innumerable moments of magic , all those afternoons of glory - all lost amid football 's tribal atmosphere			0
@entity2 's achievements at @entity5 , who he represented for eight seasons and captained , quickly forgotten by some with short memories after his move to their rivals in the blue corner of @entity8			1
@entity2 produced a masterful performance against his former club as @entity27 beat @entity5 2 - 0 @entity2 plays another accurate pass from midfield as @entity5 's @entity30 watches on @entity2 ( right ) celebrates with @entity31 after supplying the assist for @entity27 's second goal on the pitch , vicious tackles flew in			1
in the stands , barbs were traded			0
on the touchline , @entity38 and @entity39 squared up like protagonists in a playground scrap			0
and down there in the maelstrom , one man just got on with the job he 's always done with such class and distinction			2
for @entity50 , this was just business as usual			0
he would have cared little for the @entity5 taunts - bygones are bygones , what 's done is done			1
he is loving life at @entity56 , as @entity39 asserted in the build - up			0
there are no regrets at all			0
@entity2 's performance in @entity27 's 2 - 0 win reminded you of the opening lines of @entity67 's ' if ' : ' if you can keep your head when all about you / are losing theirs and blaming it on you			1
' @entity2 battles with @entity5 's @entity69 during the contest at @entity56 @entity2 's heat map from the match shows his presence right across the midfield @entity2 played a delightful ball for @entity31 to score @entity27 's second goal late on passes : 69 passing accuracy : 88.4 % @entity79 passes : 7 @entity80 passes : 62 recoveries : 13 tackles : 4 chances created : 3 assists : 1 the @entity84 may not be about to inherit the @entity85 and everything in it , but more displays like this and @entity27 will certainly win the @entity90			1
@entity5 are imposters to triumph , blown away again by @entity27 , whom they now trail by nine points in the table			1
@entity2 's afternoon was a masterclass in consistency			1
his passing was measured , metronomic as usual			0
he played 69 passes with an accuracy of 88.4 per cent			1
@entity101 , by contrast , made just 43 passes , @entity103 56			0
his heat map shows @entity2 as an omnipresence in the midfield , popping up right across the wide sweep of his own half			2
he recovered possession on 13 separate occasions			0
but the @entity112 artist left his piece de resistance until right near the end			0
a magnificent ball over the top of the @entity5 defence that picked out @entity31			1
the rest was inevitable ; a deft chip over the hopelessly stranded @entity121			0
@entity50 well and truly won the midfield battle against @entity101 as @entity27 emerged 2 - 0 winners @entity2 ( second left ) greets the @entity5 players ahead of the kick - off @entity2 is flashed up on the @entity56 big screen located high above the @entity5 fans @entity39 went the extra mile to ensure @entity2 chose @entity27 over @entity5 or @entity129 in the summer , flying out to @entity130 for a personal audience within days of learning @entity132 had made him available			1
he wooed the @entity134 - winner with a promise that he would be the keystone in @entity27 's midfield , and so it has proved			2
his assist in @entity31 's goal was his fourth for his compatriot already this season and his seventh overall , more than any @entity27 player managed in the whole of last season			1
little wonder @entity146 was on his feet in the director 's box punching the air in delight			0
the Â£ 62m on those two could well be the best money he 's ever spent			0
a delay to kick - off as @entity5 fans were held up getting in to @entity56 would n't have helped @entity2 's pre-match nerves but once he got a first feel for the ball , he was irrepressible			1
@entity27 owner @entity146 jumps in the air after @entity31 doubles his team 's lead @entity101 and @entity2 share a word as they walk off at half - time @entity5 believed @entity2 had handled in @entity101 's shot but the referee was unmoved he did n't misplace a pass inside the first 20 minutes and made a perfectly - timed tackle on compatriot @entity170			1
a nicely flighted free - kick from the right was met by @entity173 , but in an offside position			0
always available to receive a pass , he pinged the ball about with characteristic ease and soon he was initiating the move with the steal that led to @entity180 winning - and then converting - a 26th - minute penalty			0
in the second - half , @entity2 robbed @entity103 of the ball as the @entity184 shaped to shoot on the edge of the box			2
within seconds , @entity27 were in @entity5 's penalty box			1
it was indicative of his dominance over the @entity184 - and the rest of @entity5 's midfield - in all departments			2
there was one moment when @entity101 's shot may have been blocked by @entity2 's hand but referee @entity197 was unmoved by the appeals			2
and it was certainly accurately reflected in the final outcome as @entity27 's juggernaut rolled on .			2

@entity2 faced his former club @entity5 for @entity27 on *sunday*
he was taunted by @entity5 fans early in the game
but the @entity84 got on with his job , producing a brilliant performance
he recorded a passing accuracy of 88 per cent
@entity2 capped his afternoon with assist for @entity31
