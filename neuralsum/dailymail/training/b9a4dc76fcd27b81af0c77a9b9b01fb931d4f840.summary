it followed a day of air strikes aimed at government buildings in the @entity5 , including the prime minister ’s office – in response , says @entity2 , to @entity17 rockets targeted at major population centres			1
@entity4 militants continued to trade fire with @entity2 , with one rocket smashing into an apartment building in the @entity2 port city of @entity24 , injuring five people			2

steel : @entity2 soldiers prepare tanks near the border with the @entity5			1
@entity2 's @entity91 authorised the mobilisation of up to 75,000 reservists on friday , the border at @entity95 opened unexpectedly and my team of three from @entity36 were the last journalists to enter the outskirts of @entity42			1
we had to sign waiver forms to enter the official war zone because of the real risk of injury or death			2
for ten terrifying minutes we sped through no - man ’s land along unlit , empty streets on the much - shelled @entity5 side with only the sound of crickets and rumble of shelling in the background			2
we came across 18 - year - old @entity113 , whose house was blown up a few hours earlier			0
his right eye was half - closed and he had blood seeping from cuts and a hole in the back of his head			0
he could not remember anything except waking on friday in @entity123			0
intercept : @entity2 's @entity52 missile defence system blasts a @entity4 rocket out of the sky his home had been hit because his father , @entity129 , who was not at home , is a senior security official in @entity4 and had been targeted by the @entity131			1

we taped our windows for blast protection and slept on mattresses on the floor			0
meanwhile , @entity157 sit and wait			0
the @entity2 tank commanders massed on the border also wait			1
if a land invasion comes , the force will again be overwhelming – but the result will only increase the ranks of young men willing to fight for @entity4			0
victory for @entity2 will be bloody for civilians in @entity5 – but at what cost for @entity2 ?			1
