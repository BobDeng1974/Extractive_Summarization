the which ? report says councils in @entity16 and @entity17 paid out a total of £ 22.8 million to motorists who made a claim for vehicle repairs or injury caused by badly maintained roads			1
damage : motorists were paid over £ 22million in compensation last year for damage to their cars caused by potholes , a new report shows the figures suggest some councils prefer to leave potholes in place and settle the claims on their insurance rather than pay to fix the underlying problem from their road maintenance budgets			1
but individual also motorists face a ‘ pothole lottery ’ depending on where they live , says which ? councils in the @entity42 of @entity16 paid out the most in compensation at £ 8million , according to figures collated for which ? by the @entity45			1
it was followed by @entity47 and @entity48 ( £ 3.3million ) , @entity49 ( £ 3.2million ) , the @entity51 ( £ 2.7million ) the @entity50 ( £ 1.8million ) and @entity17 ( £ 1.4million )			2
the government commissioned a @entity53 in 2011 and allocated an extra £ 200 million for local highway authorities , citing a ‘ significant increase in the number of potholes on the already fragile local highway network ’			2
and in december the government gave @entity16 councils an extra £ 140million to maintain the highways			2
but which ? found that the backlog of road repairs per local authority in @entity16 is getting bigger , growing from £ 53.2 million in 2009 to £ 61.3 million last year			1

‘ our data shows that , in @entity16 and @entity17 at least , the backlog of road repairs has grown since 2009 , and another harsh winter could see it grow again			1
road defects also seem to affect some parts of the @entity67 more than others			2
’ in november highway bosses at the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) representing 370 councils across @entity16 and @entity17 warned that motorists face a pothole ‘ catastrophe ’ stretching for thousands of miles as @entity67 ’s crumbling roads reach crisis point			1
it said budget cut - backs and the threat of another severe winter mean many councils are struggling to move ‘ beyond simply patching up a deteriorating network ’ - despite filling in holes at the rate of ‘ one every 16 seconds ’			0
which ? says motorists should challenge councils to pay up when their vehicles are damaged as an incentive for them to keep roads in good order - and collect photographic evidence to support their claims			2
the cost of clearing the entire road maintenance backlog in the @entity67 which ? executive director @entity132 said : ‘ potholes are a menace for all road users			2
with temperatures plummeting this week and the bitter weather conditions set to continue , the backlog of repairs could grow again			1

’ the watchdog said the chance of claims being successful depended on whether the local authority was aware of the pothole in the first place and had not repaired it or if it had not followed road maintenance guidelines			0
potholes can be reported via a council ’s website and the @entity159 website lists which council is responsible for specific roads			0
professor @entity162 , director of the @entity163 , said : ‘ potholes are fast becoming financial black holes			0
councils are sadly mistaken if they think they are saving money by not repairing the roads			0

just before @entity171 the government dished out an extra £ 140million for road maintenance			0
it needs to be spent promptly before the claims bill goes through the roof			0

@entity177 president @entity191 said : ‘ although patching up the roads after last winter ’s ravages has brought some improvement , their condition is on a knife - edge and drivers are still likely to have to dodge potholes			0
’ local transport minister @entity200 said : ‘ we are providing councils with more than £ 3billion between 2011 and 2015 to maintain their roads and pavements and last month announced an extra £ 215 million to help councils get the best out of their road network			0
‘ this is on top of the additional £ 200 million we gave to councils in march 2011 to repair local roads damaged by the severe winter weather in 2010			1
’ he said : ‘ it is ultimately up to local highway authorities to determine how they prioritise their funding , but we want to help them get the best value for money			0

local authorities in @entity16 and @entity17 forked out millions to drivers who made claims for vehicle repairs or injury caused by badly maintained roads
figure set to soar further as the cold weather increases the chances of cracks and craters on routes around the @entity67
