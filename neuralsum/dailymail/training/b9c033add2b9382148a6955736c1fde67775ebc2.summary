@entity1 bosses thought twice about putting sir @entity2 on the new £ 5 note – because they did n’t want to upset the @entity4			1
officials warned sir @entity6 , then @entity7 , that @entity2 ’s wartime record might make him highly controversial , documents obtained by @entity11 show			1
the same officials also insisted on carrying out a background check on @entity14 , the prim spinster author of @entity15 who will appear on the £ 10 note from 2017 , to reassure themselves there were ‘ no issues in her private life ’			1
defiant : a @entity1 illustration of how the @entity2 £ 5 note will look in 2016 previously classified documents , obtained under freedom of information laws , shed light on the hitherto secret process of how the @entity1 decides which historic figures are honoured			2
in a memo dated april 11 , 2012 , sir @entity6 was advised @entity2 will be a popular choice because of his ‘ broad name recognition ’ and the public ’s ‘ very affectionate view ’ of him as a wartime leader			2
but officials also warned him that ‘ the recentness of @entity37 is a living memory for many here and on the @entity40 ’			0
the rest of the comments , which relate to @entity44 ’s relationship with its former wartime enemies , have been redacted from the files			0
a source at the @entity1 last night said : ‘ public bodies are obliged to redact any material which might impact on @entity44 ’s international relations with another country , and this is what has happened here			0
’ @entity54 , @entity2 ’s biographer , said : ‘ the comments redacted would have been about irritating the @entity4			1
i do n’t think a @entity4 or @entity57 tourist would be in the slightest bit put off by the fact there is @entity2 on a £ 5 note and he is the man who flattened @entity62 and @entity63			1
‘ they appreciate he ’s the greatest @entity65 who ever lived so you put him on the currency			0
it ’s surprising this has n’t happened earlier			0
’ no issues : fortunately @entity14 's prim and proper lifestyle did not stand in the way of her portrait being approved for the £ 10 bank note officials also warned sir @entity6 of @entity2 ’s ‘ disastrous ’ decision to return @entity44 to the gold standard in the 1920s			1
@entity2 ’s critics at the time claimed the move , with the backing of the @entity1 , produced the mass unemployment , deflation and industrial strife of the late 1920s and early 1930s			2
bank staff who conducted ‘ considerable research ’ into @entity2 ’s role in the debacle noted : ‘ if academics do pick up on the move to the gold standard it is likely they will refer to the role of the @entity1 and @entity2 ’s own criticism of the @entity1			2
’ @entity14 was considered in 1984 but ruled out because there was ‘ a lack of suitable art work ’			2
the fact no new art work has come to light since will lead to concerns she was ruled out because she was a woman			0
officials also said ‘ name recognition ’ for the novelist – whose works are often @entity109 set texts – had increased significantly thanks to film and television adaptations			0
the papers note the writer ’s ‘ high - brow , middle - brow and mass appeal ’ ; and confirm ‘ they have found no issues in her private life ’			1
the interest in @entity14 ’s private life may strike some as odd given fellow writer @entity123 , who appeared on the £ 10 note from 1992 to 2003 , had at least one mistress			1
@entity126 , of the @entity14 , said : ‘ i love the fact they went to the trouble of checking her private life			1
but there is absolutely no controversy there			0
’ @entity2 will appear on the £ 5 note from 2016			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we have taken great care to ensure men and women chosen are admired by the @entity44 public			0

officials worried that @entity2 's wartime record might make him controversial for *visitors* from @entity4 and @entity57
they also *investigated* @entity14 's private life checking for ' issues '
