@entity1 head coach @entity0 has ordered his troops not to be caught out at @entity3 as they were after the last international break			1
a month ago , the @entity1 returned to @entity6 action at @entity7 having welcomed back players from their respective countries , and were trounced 8 - 0 in an horrific 90 minutes which cast a pall over what had been a relatively positive start to the season			1
this time around they head for the @entity16 with the @entity18 warning there is no room for a post-international hangover			2
@entity0 hopes @entity1 will avoid another post-international break trouncing against @entity3 @entity0 will face off against @entity3 manager @entity23 for three points at the @entity16 @entity0 said : ' we have to make sure that we are much better than the previous game after the international break , if you know what i mean			1
' there was a little bit of a reminder this morning to think about what we did last time we were internationals and to make sure we do n't feel that way again , and that we forget as quickly as possible about the internationals and all the stories about the national teams and the travelling and think about @entity1			1
' that 's the best way to come back			2
close it , " that 's it , the internationals have finished until the next one in march , i 'm not going to think about it now , i am fully focussed on @entity1 "			1
' the dark day on the south coast was followed by a 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity47 , but @entity1 have rather steadied the ship since , winning 3 - 1 at @entity49 before an eventful 1 - 1 draw with @entity51 last time out			1
the trip to @entity3 is one they will view as an opportunity to extend that run against the promoted foxes , who after a promising start to life in the top flight , have found the going a little tougher since			1
@entity7 ran riot in an 8 - 0 victory over @entity1 after the last international break last month @entity1 goalkeeper @entity65 had a nightmare that day at @entity67 @entity23 's men have taken just a single point from the last 18 on offer , although @entity0 is convinced that return is not an accurate reflection of what they have to offer			1
he said : ' normally when you finish the season in the @entity77 well , you normally start well because of the adrenaline and the craziness of having the chance to play there , and if one or two results go for you , you get a little bit longer			0
' i think that 's what happened to @entity3 in the beginning			1
everything was going well for them			0
but you ca n't maintain adrenaline for 25 games			0
you get one , two , three , four or whatever and then you just feel that you are a @entity6 team			0
' then you need to maintain that , and that 's when it 's a little bit tougher			0
that 's why it 's maybe a little bit downhill at the moment			0
' but i do n't think there 's a difference between @entity3 and the rest of the bottom 10 , there are ups and downs in there			2
like any other manager , the sooner they get it up again , the better for them			0
' of course when they play against us , we will try not to let that happen , but i think that 's what @entity23 is going to be looking to , to use this game as a comeback to the feeling at the beginning of the season			0
' @entity1 forward @entity122 should start the game after shaking off an ankle injury @entity124 will face @entity0 for the first time since they were together at @entity126 @entity0 will be boosted by the return of midfielder @entity128 from suspension , while striker @entity122 has shaken off the ankle injury which promoted his early return from @entity132 duty			1
but he will hope @entity23 does not select his main frontman this weekend after seeing at close hand what @entity124 is capable of during their time together at @entity126			0
@entity0 signed the former @entity138 striker january last and was not at all surprised when the @entity139 took the Â£ 8million plunge 18 months later			2
he said : ' i am pleased he is doing well			0
i hope he does n't play - if @entity23 does n't want him to play , i will be delighted			2
he 's a special player			0
