happy : @entity0 has been given a pink hand through the pioneering 3d printer technology the first thing four - year - old @entity0 wanted to do when scientists gave her a new hand was brush her @entity8 doll ’s hair			1
the youngster – who was born with a just a thumb on her left hand – has been given the pink hand through the pioneering 3d printer technology			1
she has now been using her new hand to pick up objects around her house , ride her bike , and even pinch her dad on the bottom			1
full - time mum @entity18 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , started a campaign to find local access to a 3d printer three months ago and said the new hand had revolutionised her daughter ’s life			1
the 47 - year - old said : ‘ when we got home , the first thing she did was pick up her dolly so she could brush her hair with two hands			2
‘ that is one thing she always wanted to do			2
she had always loved her dolls and wanted to dress them - but i ended up always having to do it for her			2
‘ it is amazing and wonderful to see her do it herself			2
she is just like any other girl - @entity8 is her favourite			2
‘ this is just so special for @entity0			1
the smile on my daughter ’s face is from ear to ear with a bow round the back			2
‘ i am now finding things all over the house			2
she ’s even managed to pinch her daddy ’s bum			2
the determination on her face is the sweetest thing , and the fact she ’s willing to receive the hand and willing to work at learning to use it			1
’ the hand works by opening and closing when @entity0 bends her wrist up or down			1
it has a velcro which straps around her palm and the gauntlet sits on her arm			2
@entity0 had an operation at 18 months old , taking parts of her toes to give her a bigger palm , and replacing the toes with hip bone			1
but her mother said she and husband @entity85 , 34 , would not consider any more operations after seeing the success of her hand			1
she said : ‘ it is fantastic and we just ca n’t stop her using it			0
she wants to wear it all the time and can not believe what she has now got			0
new lease : @entity18 says the pink hand has changed @entity0 's life and the four - year - old has been testing out the new kit by picking things up and putting them down all over the house @entity0 's hand costs around £ 50 in materials to print a hand , so new limbs can be created as she grows ‘ she is still building up her strength and getting used to it - and she can not hold anything too heavy			1
‘ but she is going around picking everything up , from cups to fruit , and playing with all the toys she was never able to before			0
’ she loves dress - up as well and is finding that a lot easier now she has two hands			0
@entity0 's hand is among designs available on a global database of 3d printer prosthetics and comes in 30 colours			1
it was printed in around 20 pieces which were put together with elastic bands before a professional helped to fit it			0
the hand is attached to @entity0 ’s arm with @entity130 straps			1
she can control it by twisting her wrist to tighten the bands			0
the 3d printer was provided by it firm @entity134 , and the enabling @entity136 website printed it out and helped fit it			0
a @entity134 spokesman said @entity140 prosthetics were usually for aesthetic purposes only and did not move or grip			0
he added that it costs around £ 50 in materials to print a hand , so new limbs can be created as a child grows			1
‘ she was never able to ride a bike before as her hands would slip off the handlebars			0
but she is now riding it around the house			0
‘ the technology is fantastic			0
the more she gets to use it , the stronger her wrist and arm will become			0
there is no way i would consider another operation for her now - this is just way too functional			0
‘ because her muscles are n’t as developed in that arm , we keep having to take it off her so she does n’t overdo it			0
but in time the muscles will get stronger and she ’ll be able to use it more and more			0
‘ it ’s not going to be a permanent fixture on her arm but it ’s there as and when she needs two hands			0
’ @entity0 , who is in reception class at school , said of her new hand : ‘ i love wearing it so much			1
i want to wear it forever and ever			0
’ mrs @entity0 launched the appeal for organisations with a 3d printer to help @entity0 , and the @entity185 at @entity186 , with the help of it firm @entity188 , came forward			1
the family has since raised nearly £ 4,000 to get a nearby school kitted out with a 3d printer to help other children in a similar position to @entity0 .			1

@entity0 , 4 , was born with just a thumb on her left hand
she now has a pink prosthetic hand through @entity191 tech
it costs £ 50 to print , so new limbs can be created as she grows
