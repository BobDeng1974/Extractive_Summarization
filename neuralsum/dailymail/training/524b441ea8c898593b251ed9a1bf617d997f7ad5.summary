@entity0 will hope those in the corridors of power at @entity3 still feel festive			1
the @entity5 manager is a man under pressure			1
one win in 12 games , and a run of seven points from 36 after friday ’s resounding loss against @entity12 , is relegation form — the sort of form that has managers looking over their shoulder			1

@entity23 rounded off a team - move to give @entity12 the lead in the 17th minute and the first goal is shown by our match zone graphic - click here for match zone there has not been a sacking in the @entity22 yet this season , but chants of ‘ you do n’t know what you ’re doing ’ , echoed around @entity3 in the second half			1
@entity0 knew who they were aimed at , and so will chairman @entity89			0
another loss against @entity92 on sunday , then @entity90 could be deciding more than his @entity94 resolutions next week			0
asked if he retained the confidence of @entity5 ’s board , @entity0 responded : ‘ the answer would be you have to look at the club ’s targets and at what we ’re trying to do			2
we are with the squad we have had from the start and i think we are doing as well as we can			0
‘ we have to cut out the mistakes and i ’m sure the chairman and the others will agree			0
when you lose a game you are responsible as a manager and if i was one of the players today , i would blame the manager			0
‘ i thought @entity5 had a lot of luck last year ( in staying up )			2
i do n’t see us getting a lot of luck this year , so i ’m sure we are due a little bit			0
@entity23 rounded @entity5 goalkeeper @entity29 before slotting into the empty net to give @entity12 the lead @entity12 celebrate the opening goal of the game from @entity23 as they take the lead at @entity3 ‘ you ca n’t concede goals like we did today , they were all very poor			1
i think all fans , when 3 - 0 down , will give their manager a bit of stick			0
‘ i thought they were very good today , you just have to keep going			0
’ @entity12 , meanwhile , look to be back on track after a recent blip			2
@entity133 ’s side were dominant in every aspect , but we will learn more about @entity12 ’ top - four credentials over the coming weeks — their next three league fixtures are against @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
‘ it was a good performance , and we are back on a good run — winning two in a row now , ’ said @entity133			0
‘ three points away is important because we want to fight for the next position			0
our next games are going to be a challenge , but the win over @entity5 makes the games more comfortable			1
’ @entity12 took a 17th minute lead thanks to @entity23 ’s coolness under pressure and @entity154 ’s brilliant vision			1
the way @entity23 rounded @entity29 was excellent , but @entity157 ’s one - touch through ball surpassed the finish			2
three minutes into the second period , it was game over			0
@entity23 was again in the thick of the action as he escaped the attentions of @entity33 to set up @entity59 , who smashed past @entity29 with his unfavoured right foot			1
and four minutes later @entity5 were three down as @entity51 rose above @entity33 to hammer home a powerful header from @entity58 ’s outswinging corner			1
@entity59 ( third left ) doubled @entity12 's lead early in the second half against @entity5 @entity51 rises highest to head home @entity12 's third goal to put his side in command @entity51 ( right ) celebrates his goal for @entity12 as they cruised past @entity5 on @entity176 @entity31 pulled back a late goal for @entity5 , but it proved to be little more than a consolation the @entity5 fans ’ frustrations boiled over in the 72nd minute when @entity0 replaced @entity39 — @entity5 ’s biggest attacking threat — with defender @entity40			1
sunday ’s clash against @entity92 was in @entity0 ’s mind , as was the fact that the winger ’s partner is due to give birth any day now			0
but it was the last straw for the home supporters who gave their manager a volley of criticism			0
@entity31 headed home a consolation for @entity5 — but that was n’t enough to prevent @entity0 and his side from being loudly booed off at full - time			1
@entity12 's travelling supporters wore red and white @entity200 hats in the away end at @entity3 @entity5 's cheerleaders , the crystals , dressed up in festive costumes for the @entity176 game and three minutes into the second period , it was game over – @entity23 again in the thick of the action			1
there looked to be little danger when he collected @entity53 's throw near the left hand byline , but the @entity214 easily escaped the attentions of @entity33 before rifling a low cross into the @entity5 area that @entity60 missed – but @entity218 smashed past @entity29 – with his unfavoured right foot – as he steamed into the area			2
the problems were mounting for @entity0 , he was forced to replace @entity41 – who was clutching his hamstring – with @entity42 immediately after the goal			2
four minutes later his side were three down as a result of one of the simplest goals you 'll see this @entity229 as @entity51 rose above @entity33 to hammer home a powerful header from @entity157 's outswinging cross			2
@entity0 made the logical decision to throw on @entity234 in attempt to inject some urgency into his lacklustre attack in the 67th minute ; but it was @entity12 who continued to press , @entity23 again going close with a curling effort from the edge of the area			1
@entity5 's next substitution , perhaps was n't so logical , replacing @entity39 – their biggest attacking threat – with defender @entity40			2
sunday 's clash against @entity92 was obviously in @entity0 's mind , not that the home supporters cared as they gave their manager both barrells			0
@entity31 headed home a late consolation for @entity5 – but that did n't stop the boos at full - time			1
make no bones about it , @entity0 is under pressure .			0

@entity12 secure their second *straight* victory as they beat @entity5 at @entity3
@entity23 scored the opener before @entity59 and @entity51 secured victory
@entity31 scored a late consolation goal for @entity5
defeat leaves @entity5 in the relegation zone and still without a league win in *december*
