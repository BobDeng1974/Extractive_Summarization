a lot has changed since @entity1 played the first of his @entity3 more than 13 years ago			1
professionalism has been the key to the former shelf - stacker ’s longevity , although the @entity8 has not always been surrounded by such healthy company			0
on the week of his debut in 2002 , the young and enthusiastic second - row had to share a room with former @entity15 team - mate @entity14			1
@entity16 of @entity17 and @entity18 of @entity19 pose with the @entity21 trophy @entity18 will lead @entity19 out at the @entity22 on the occasion of his 100th international cap @entity18 prepares to offload the ball during the @entity19 training session ahead of the game last week @entity18 's importance to @entity19 can not be overstated as he wins his 100th cap against @entity17 on saturday			1
over the past 13 years , the iconic @entity15 lock has become the side 's beating heart and captain			1
' he 's an outstanding leader , ' says @entity19 fly - half @entity34			1
' when he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your next stand up			0
' their billets were turned into an @entity44 cards den in the days leading up to the @entity21 visit of @entity17 ; a stark contrast to the preparations for this meeting at the @entity22			2
‘ i was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning , ’ recalled a laughing @entity1			0
‘ “ @entity52 ” used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up			0
i was well aware from @entity14 that this was not the way forward ! ‘ obviously it ’s changed a lot since then			2
it ’s funny , there ’s a lot more guys to copy now then when i made my first cap			2
now in the @entity44 camp i take a lot of advice from ( strength and conditioning coach ) @entity71			0
@entity34 is obviously a great guy to copy and follow			0
’ it is testament to @entity1 ’s longevity that half of the current @entity75 coaching set - up were playing against him in that match — a record 54 - 10 victory at @entity81			2
both @entity82 and @entity83 have since escaped to the warm comfort of the tactical box where — along with @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 — they will be hoping to plot @entity19 ’s downfall at the @entity22 this afternoon			2
@entity18 powers over for a try in the 54 - 10 victory for @entity19 over @entity17 back in 2002 , his debut half of the current @entity75 coaching set - up were playing @entity18 at @entity81 in his first game all eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end @entity19 ’s @entity103 push and keep alive their own championship hopes			1
they have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from @entity34 and @entity108 , with scrum - half @entity109 promising not to repeat the mistakes that @entity112 made in @entity113 two weeks ago			1
‘ i do n’t know if @entity112 did much analysis on them , ’ said @entity109			1
‘ they did n’t seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever			0
we need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error			0
’ the heavily influenced kicking strategy has been criticised for lacking entertainment value			0
@entity109 admits attractive rugby will come second as @entity17 look to derail @entity19 's @entity103 hopes all @entity127 boss @entity126 recently said that rugby is ‘ geared towards defences that inhibit attack ’ and @entity82 is predicting another war of attrition in the @entity75 capital			1
‘ attractive rugby will come second , ’ said the 44 - year - old			0
‘ that ’s the nature of the game at the moment and unfortunately the spectators have got to pay a price for that			0
’ it promises to be an intense tactical battle between @entity87 and counterpart @entity142 , with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired @entity19 lock @entity144 during the week			2
@entity87 was said to have ‘ the intellectual properties of a tub of @entity147 ’ , although @entity1 holds the @entity148 in much higher regard			0
@entity109 says @entity17 need ' to be on the money ' in their @entity21 - defining clash with @entity19 @entity17 captain @entity16 makes his way into the stadium for @entity17 training ahead of @entity21 clash ‘ for as long as i can remember we ’ve being trying to poach ideas from @entity87 , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ we played @entity158 with @entity15 in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an @entity163 ( strength and conditioning ) and nutritional point of view			2
it was a rude awakening			0
he makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking			0
‘ at the start of the championship , @entity142 said the @entity17 - @entity112 game was going to be the standard - bearer			1
two years ago @entity19 beat them in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against @entity112			1
‘ they ’ll feel the same thing is happening now			0
’ kicking game in @entity108 and @entity34 , @entity19 have the world ’s in - form kicking half - back combination			1
their aerial game - plan was predictable against @entity112 yet @entity183 did not have the players at his disposable to stop it			1
@entity17 , however , have one of the best defensive back - threes in the world and @entity188 is a master at limiting the space to kick into			2
how well @entity19 anticipate that - perhaps using @entity34 as a looping runner , if the wingers drop back - will be highly significant			2
set - piece at 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in , @entity192 of @entity17 and @entity193 of @entity19 are two of the tallest players in the competition			1
they are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line - out throw , while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents ’			0
their long limbs are used to try and steal ball , although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul , where both @entity17 and @entity19 are particularly effective			1
picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal ; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of @entity211 and @entity1			0
breakdown @entity75 defence coach @entity89 claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area			0
however , they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against @entity19 , who won 23 turnovers to nine against @entity112 in round three			1
@entity87 ’s game - plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and @entity19 will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of @entity225 and @entity226			1
getting on the right side of referee @entity228 will be key , because @entity188 and @entity34 are two of the world ’s leading goal - kickers .			0

@entity19 's iconic captain @entity18 wins his 100th cap against @entity17
a lot has changed since the @entity15 man made his debut in 2002
but @entity17 scrum - half @entity109 has plan to ruin the big day
@entity109 says he did not agree with way @entity112 *approached* @entity19 game
