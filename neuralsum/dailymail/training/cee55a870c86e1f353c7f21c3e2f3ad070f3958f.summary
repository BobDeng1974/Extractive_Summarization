by @entity0 astonishing footage has revealed the dramatic moment that a snorkeler was saved by a passing surfer just moments before a strong @entity6 current would have claimed his life			1
the rescue was captured on the swimmer 's water - proof video camera , which appears to be attached to his head as he snorkels just off @entity12 in @entity13			1
the film , which was found along the shore two weeks after the rescue , reveals him struggling against a strong tide as he moans quietly for help and bobs up and down in the water			1
the surfer , @entity32 , told @entity39 that he had swam nearby to check on the man when he saw him raise his hand all the way up			1
' hold on to the board , lay on the board ! ' @entity32 and his friend urge as the man moans			1
' thirty seconds more , 90 per cent chance he would have died , ' @entity32 said			2
he looked ' like pure blue kind of swollen and his eyes were barely there - almost rolled back			0
' safety : the camera shows the man being pulled to the shore after he was overwhelmed by the current relief : as he sees the rocks , he knocks off the camera - and it was found 2 weeks later by a passerby the two men pulled the man safely to shore using the surfboard and the video captures the rocks as they get closer to the beach			1
at this point , the man knocks off the camera and it falls into the water			2
' the guy was pretty much heaving , ' @entity32 said			0
' he could n't even hold himself up			0
' it is not known if the man received medical care , but @entity32 did not get his name and does not know his identity			2
@entity39 , which published the video exclusively , also did not know who he was			0
questions : @entity32 , left , rescued the man on his surfboard two weeks ago and passerby @entity80 , right , found his camera along the shore - but the identity of the snorkeler is still not known two weeks later , passerby @entity80 was at the beach when he found the camera and watched in horror as he played the scenes back			1
' when you see the video for the first time and you do n't know the outcome , it 's terrifying , ' he said			0
' luckily the surfer came into view			0
[ @entity97 ] breathed a sigh of relief			0
' see below for video			0
