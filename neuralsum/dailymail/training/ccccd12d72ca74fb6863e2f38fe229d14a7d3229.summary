@entity0 , pictured , promised to make education his priority but his government 's huge increase in spending actually led to ' no improvement in student learning outcomes ' billions of pounds poured into education under @entity10 resulted in ‘ no improvements ’ in standards , a major report revealed yesterday			1
despite @entity0 declaring his priorities as ‘ education , education , education ’ when he swept to power in 1997 , a huge increase in spending on schools led to ‘ no improvement in student learning outcomes ’ , the report found			1
in fact , the @entity25 ’s teenagers have slipped down world league tables in crucial subjects while the country ’s schools have become among the most socially segregated across the world			1
@entity25 ’s immigrant children are clustered in the most disadvantaged schools , the report found			1
eighty per cent of students with an immigrant background attend schools with a ‘ high concentration ’ of children from similar families			1
only @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 have higher levels , a study of 34 countries by the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) found			2
primary school class sizes are bigger only in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and rising numbers of young people have become @entity55 , ‘ not in education , employment or training ’			2
the findings are a damning indictment of the former @entity10 government , suggesting their education policies have had little impact and taxpayers have failed to get value for money			2
they come just a day after the @entity67 and the @entity68 announced a ‘ work to rule ’ , with staff sticking rigidly to six - and - a - half hour days , refusing all non-teaching duties and threatening strikes			2
the @entity42 study – education at a glance – found that expenditure on @entity25 primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of @entity81 increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009 , higher than the @entity42 average of 4.0 per cent			1
at the same time , there has been ‘ no improvement in student learning outcomes ’ , the report says			0
@entity87 , deputy director for education at the @entity42 , said : ‘ spending in the @entity25 has gone up really a lot and has not been reflected in changes to [ exam ] scores			1
you have seen huge effort on the part of @entity97 and at the same time outcomes have been flat			0
’ separate figures released by the @entity100 have shown that @entity10 ’s spending on education rose from £ 35.3billion in 2000 to £ 63.9billion in 2009			0
the @entity42 monitors standards by administering its own tests in reading , maths and science for hundreds of thousands of 15 - year - olds in up to 70 countries every three years			0
the most recent results in 2010 revealed that the @entity25 fell from 24th to 28th position in maths , 14th to 16th in science and 17th to 25th in reading			1
the average class size in primary schools in 2010 was 25.8 pupils – above the @entity42 average of 21.3			1
failings : the report found that primary school class sizes are bigger only in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 meanwhile , the social make - up of @entity25 schools poses ‘ significant challenges ’ for immigrant students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds , according to the @entity42			1
some 79.8 per cent of immigrant students whose mothers are poorly educated – not achieving any qualifications beyond gcse level – are concentrated in disadvantaged schools			1
this is a higher proportion than any other @entity42 country			0
the average level is 55.9 per cent			0
however , the situation is not limited to children with poorly educated mothers			0
some 42.5 per cent of immigrant students born to highly educated mothers – those who have a degree – are in disadvantaged schools			2
this is also a higher proportion than any other country examined by researchers , with the average being 26.1 per cent			0
these figures relate to 2009			0
@entity145 mp @entity144 said yesterday : ‘ @entity10 ’s answer to falling educational standards was to throw more and more money at the problem			0
‘ this evidence demolishes that approach once and for all			0
it ’s not how much you spend that counts , but what you spend it on			0
