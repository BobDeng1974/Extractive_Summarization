by @entity0 @entity1 is trying her best to be positive @entity2 is trying her best to be positive			1
but since a back condition left her disabled , incontinent and without a sex life , it 's hardly surprising she sometimes struggles to see the brighter side			1
the 42 - year - old mother of two girls is scraping by on disability benefits after having to close a successful cleaning business			1
@entity1 ( pictured ) does n't blame her husband , but is furious to be facing a lifetime of pain and loss			1
what hurts most is that it was all so unnecessary - clear warning signs were missed			1
@entity1 's problem first struck in 2010			1
she 'd been coping with intermittent back pain for years , which came on gradually , with no clear cause			1
then one night , turning over in bed , she felt something suddenly ' go '			1
' i woke up in agony			1
i was in so much pain i could n't breathe			1
' i thought " this is something quite scary "			1
it felt completely abnormal , ' says @entity1			1
' in my buttocks and the tops of my thighs , i could feel pins and needles and a heavy feeling			1
' with her husband 's help , she managed to get out of bed and drag herself into the @entity39 went to see her gp that morning			1
she 'd had an mri scan only three days before , to investigate her back pain - this showed she had a severe prolapse , a slipped disc pressing on a nerve			1
though he had n't seen the scan , @entity1 's gp was convinced she was now suffering from cauda equina syndrome and sent her to @entity51 with a note saying so			1
the cauda equina , literally ' horse 's tail ' , is the bundle of nerves at the base of the spine			1
they control feeling and movement in the feet , lower legs and ' saddle ' area - the bottom , genitals , rectum , and bladder			1
cauda equina syndrome is where these nerves become compressed - due to a slipped disc , a tumour or an injury			2
the result is a contradictory - sounding combination of pain and numbness			2
surgery is the only treatment			2
if done early enough , this can prevent the syndrome from becoming permanent			2
but in the worst cases , patients are unable to walk and rely on a wheelchair			2
many face a lifetime of incontinence and sexual dysfunction			2
while the condition is thought to affect ' just ' a few hundred people in the @entity93 each year , the consequences are devastating			1
with her gp 's referral , @entity1 should have been passed to a specialist spinal unit when she got to hospital			2
but the scan results were never passed on ; instead she was discharged with a diagnosis of ' spinal stenosis ' , a narrowing of the spinal canal			2
she says : ' i argued with the junior doctor			2
i said : " i ca n't feel my bowels or my coccyx			2
there 's something desperately wrong			2
" ' by now , the clock was ticking			2
cauda equina syndrome is where nerves at base of spine become compressed as @entity116 , a urology specialist at @entity118 , explains , the chances of a complete recovery are highest if the patient has surgery within 24 hours			2
' if a nerve is being pressed on , its blood supply is being impaired and it will eventually die			0
the sooner you decompress that , the sooner you ensure it remains viable			0
' in the evening , @entity1 went back to the hospital and was admitted			1
cauda equina syndrome was diagnosed , and she was rushed to a larger hospital			0
but there were no orthopaedic surgeons free when she arrived , and there was disagreement about the urgency of her case			0
@entity1 was scheduled for an operation first thing the next day , but was shunted down the list			0
it was lunchtime before she went into surgery , at least 36 hours after the pain first hit			0
' the surgery was successful in that i 'm not completely paralysed , ' says @entity1			0
but because she was sent home without a catheter , she suffered a bladder and uterus prolapse			0
four years on , @entity1 has been left with partial paralysis of the legs			1
the pain is always there			0
she is doubly incontinent and unable to work			0
proportion of back pain patients who have no clear cause of their condition but the worst thing , she says , is the loss of sexual function , which ruined her marriage			1
she and her husband have now divorced			0
the @entity161 trust that treated @entity1 has admitted liability for failing to pass on her scan and is negotiating compensation			0
but she wants to make sure others do n't suffer in the same way , and has set up the @entity167 to campaign for more awareness of the symptoms and better care			0
@entity171 , head of medical negligence at @entity173 , the @entity174 firm representing @entity1 , says : ' there seems to be a significant lack of education across different specialities			0
i think we 've had physiotherapists , gps , paramedics , junior doctors in @entity51 , orthopaedic surgeons , even neurosurgeons missing the signs			0
' this has cost the @entity161 dearly			0
the @entity189 has paid out Â£ 377 million since 1995 for 159 cases involving cauda equina syndrome			0
a further 180 cases are still being brought			0
the @entity193 denies there 's a widespread lack of understanding			0
spokesman @entity197 , a consultant neurosurgeon at @entity198 , @entity199 , says : ' it 's always helpful to repeat messages , especially to non-specialists , but i do n't think there is a mass of ignorance about this			0
' he points instead to the early symptoms being difficult to differentiate from the acute back pain that brings thousands of people to @entity51 each year			1
' the problem is that many patients present in the phase before they have the complete syndrome			0
' mr @entity197 adds that sending all the patients with back pain and urinary changes for mri scans would consume huge amounts of @entity161 resources			1
@entity2 is not convinced , and @entity116 agrees			1
' i 've been involved with 100 cases now and i get the impression that some doctors do n't recognise the subtle signs that indicate nerve compression , ' he says			0
it 's not just the physical effects that are so devastating			0
callers to @entity1 's helpline say the @entity161 has been slow to recognise the psychological shock			0
' men find it very difficult to deal with the fact it makes them impotent			0
i spoke to one man of 29			0
' it 's a massive , life - changing thing			1
some people never get over it			0

back condition left @entity2 , 42 , disabled and without a sex life
