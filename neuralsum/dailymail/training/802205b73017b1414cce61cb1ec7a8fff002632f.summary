by @entity0 what is it about diamonds ? they may be a girl ’s best friend , but the bigger and more famous they are the more they seem to bring bad luck			1
this was certainly true of the @entity11 , probably the biggest diamond necklace ever made			1
the scandal it caused helped to bring down @entity15 as @entity16 of @entity17 — though she never , in fact , possessed it			1
the extraordinary story of the necklace has been the inspiration for a novel by @entity24 , a play by @entity26 and an essay by @entity28 , but historians edge round it nervously because the truth is so hard to establish			1
contemporary accounts are unreliable and full of lies			2
downfall : soon after the @entity35 trial @entity15 was executed @entity36 has tunnelled into the warren of misinformation like a badger digger and has come out with what must be as near the truth as we ’ll get			1
at the beginning of the book he lists the characters most involved			2
let us concentrate on four			2
@entity47 , the necklace itself : 647 stones weighing 2,800 carats			1
this monstrous lump of vulgarity was designed by @entity54 ’s court jeweller for the king ’s mistress , @entity55			2
unfortunately , the old monarch died before it was finished and the jeweller was confronted with the new young queen @entity15 , who told him decisively that she did n’t want it			1
@entity15 ’s character has been dissected endlessly and usually to her shame			1
she was accused of every kind of sexual misdemeanour			2
it ’s hard to reconcile the rumours of orgies at @entity70 with her actual habit of dressing up as a milkmaid on her miniature farm in the grounds			2
people believed the worst of her , partly because her husband , @entity78 , was known to be completely sexually incapable until , after seven years , doctors cured him			1
even then he showed little enthusiasm for his marital duties : he entered , stayed for two minutes , then withdrew , without leaving a calling card			2
for all its absurd formality @entity70 was a hot - bed of sexual liaison — marooned in empty country like a forerunner of @entity89 , it was a combination of gambling den and knocking shop			2
its main occupation was gossip and , of course , much of that was about the supposed adventures of the @entity16			2
the @entity97 was supposedly cursed after being stolen form a statue in @entity99			2
the first vicitm was diamond dealer @entity101 , who was apparently torn to pieces by wild dogs the @entity104 is said to bring bad luck only to its male owners , but good luck to women one of the gossipers was cardinal @entity110			1
he was popular , pleasant and witty and had success with women — but not with @entity15 , who hated him partly because she learned he had spread a rumour that she was having an affair with her brother - in - law			1
to @entity110 ’s dismay , she either ignored or avoided him			2
he believed that her opposition was preventing the king from offering him a senior government post			0
enter a female firebrand , who set this situation alight : @entity122			0
with her complacent husband , she had clawed a place on the fringe of the court			0
they could barely afford their lodging at @entity70 , but she was determined to insinuate her way into the inner circle			0
though she was not a beauty , @entity122 had immediate appeal to men			0
she was quick - witted , amoral , unscrupulous and very determined			0
to attract the @entity16 ’s attention she staged a fainting fit in a corridor when @entity15 was approaching			1
she soon persuaded people the @entity16 had later sent for her and she had become a royal confidante ( they were the same age — 29 )			1
dark history : a replica of the @entity11 and there were letters signed by the @entity16 to prove it			1
@entity122 had secured the services of a forger			0
her next conquest was of @entity148 , who took pity on her poverty			0
he took her interests to heart and possibly to bed as well			0
she promised to speak to the @entity16 on his behalf and ask forgiveness for him			0
but he wanted more , a meeting			0
she recruited a young @entity70 prostitute who resembled the @entity16 in face and figure			0
the heavily veiled girl was given a rose to hand to @entity110 and rehearsed a speech , which he believed conveyed that his future would soon be assured			0
@entity110 was then told that the @entity16 was short of funds and would be grateful if he could oversee the purchase of the @entity11 from the court jeweller			1
between them the sale was agreed			0
@entity169 : 1.6 million francs ( worth £ 30 million today )			0
first instalment to be paid six months later			0
@entity110 gave the necklace to a man he believed was a servant of the @entity16			1
he was , in fact , an accomplice of @entity122			0
she swiftly had the necklace broken up and the stones were sent to @entity176 to be sold			1
she and her husband were in funds and lived very well			0
but it could n’t last			0
when no instalments were paid , a desperate court jeweller sought an interview with the @entity16			0
she was furious to hear @entity110 had pretended he was acting on her behalf			0
@entity15 insisted that she wanted a public trial			1
she was to regret that later			0
months of evidence — lying , contradictory , unbelievable — came tumbling out , transfixing the citizens of @entity17 and all @entity187			1
the wold 's largest diamond - the @entity190 - weighed 530.2 carats though she played no part in the actual story , many believed she did behind the scenes			1
it all blackened her reputation further			1
@entity110 was acquitted by a majority verdict			0
@entity122 was sentenced to be flogged and branded on both shoulders			0
@entity15 was executed by guillotine soon after			1
@entity200 said : ‘ @entity16 ’s death must be dated from the @entity35 trial			1

the @entity11 is the biggest diamond necklace ever made
@entity15 was brought down by the scandal caused by the necklace , despite never actually possessing it
when a con woman stole the necklace the @entity17 queen demanded a trial , blackening her reputation with the people ; she was executed soon after
