a girl of 15 had to cope with a screaming heckler at the @entity3 conference yesterday after she spoke in praise of her academy school			0
resurrecting old @entity3 ’s views on education , the heckler sought to shout down @entity9 , a @entity10 pupil from @entity11 in @entity12 – even though the school was a flagship creation of the last @entity3 government			1
@entity9 , a star pupil at the academy which opened in 2006 , sought asylum in @entity18 at the age of six from @entity20 with just the clothes on her back			1
scroll down to watch the heckling @entity9 was giving a speech at the @entity25 when she was heckled about attending the @entity11 delegates were quick to condemn the outburst from one member of the audience in the @entity31 conference hall but when she made an emotional speech about how the school has helped her , she faced yobbish abuse from a woman believed to be a member of one of the teaching unions			1
the heckler shouted support for comprehensive schools as @entity9 told the conference how she and her fellow pupils benefited from an arts education			1
the teenager , an @entity46 student who was recently chosen to conduct an interview with @entity48 when she visited the school , continued unfazed			1
education secretary @entity49 last night condemned the ‘ disgraceful ’ incident and demanded that the heckler be kicked out of the @entity3			1
the intervention was an embarrassment for @entity54 and a reminder of the left - wingers who oppose even the last @entity3 government ’s education reforms			1
headteacher @entity59 with students at the @entity11 in west @entity12 when the @entity11 was set up in september 2006 to replace a failing school , just one in four pupils achieved five gcses including @entity64 and @entity65 graded a * to @entity66 , the main benchmark for success at age 16			1
the academies programme ( @entity11 , above ) was first established under @entity72 's @entity3 government to boost standards in poorer areas			1
in 2010 , under the new coalition government , education secretary @entity49 opened up the scheme to allow all schools to apply for academy status			1
academies are semi-independent state schools , free from local authority control , that receive their funding directly and have more freedom over areas such as the curriculum and staff pay and conditions			0
as of january this year , there were 1,529 academies in @entity64 , compared with 200 in may 2010 when the @entity90 came to power			2
the previous @entity3 government introduced academies as a secondary - only programme but the @entity90 has extended the freedoms to primaries			2
ministers can also use powers under the @entity99 to require schools to convert to academies if they are consistently failing			0
last year that figure had soared to 69 per cent , even though three out of four pupils do not speak @entity64 as a first language			2
in 2011 the school also sent its first pupil to @entity107			0
teachers turned round the school with a focus on solid academic subjects such as maths , with every pupil measured against personal targets every six weeks , with the results published to encourage competitive improvement			0
it also enforces a strict uniform policy and a code that ‘ the street stops at the gate ’			2
the mood turned ugly yesterday when @entity9 talked about arts programmes at the school			0
‘ some of us explore our creativity through thousands of hours of brushstrokes and hundreds of hours of art. to many of you this may seem extraordinary that an inner city school offers so much , but to us at @entity131 this is nothing but normal			0
’ at this point , the furious heckler yelled : ‘ they do that at comprehensives too you know			0
’ there was a murmur of support from some seated with the heckler , but others booed the interruption and a woman shouted : ‘ leave her alone			2
’ the reaction to her coming under fire was instant on @entity149 , where one viewer , @entity150 said : ‘ appalled that a # @entity152 delegate heckled a pupil who came to @entity18 as a political asylum seeker 4 championing the @entity11 she attends			1
’ another called @entity156 said : ‘ bad form			0
delegate actually just heckled a year 11 student			1
’ the first three academies – state - funded schools independent of town hall control – were opened by @entity3 in 2002			2
a further 200 had opened by the time the party left office in 2010 , mainly replacing under - performing comprehensives			2
the @entity90 expanded the programme and allowed existing schools to gain the status as well			0
there are now more than 2,300			0
ministers attribute their good results to greater freedoms enjoyed by heads , including over staff pay , the curriculum and the school calendar			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ no one should be heckled at a party conference , least of all a teenage girl making her first speech			0
