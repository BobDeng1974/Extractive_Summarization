there 's no doubt that the selfie has become a bona fide cultural phenomenon , flooding the internet and social networking sites on an hourly basis			1
but it appears some selfie - goers are still a little confused about when it is and is n't appropriate to whip out the camera phone for a self - portrait			0
from the onlooker who posed cheerily at the scene of the @entity15 siege , to the teen who took a solo shot in front of the dead relative 's casket , we show you the world 's stupidest selfies			2
dearly departed ? this smirking youth 's dead gran is in the casket behind him - but he still poses for a selfie hostage to hilarity : this onlooker seemed disturbingly cheerful as he posed out the caf√© siege in @entity15 earlier this month another flaming narcissist : a cheesy grin while @entity34 firemen battle a raging blaze in the background he 's no hotshot : @entity39 's burning pier is an obvious photo - op for this young man @entity43 horror : the girl 's smile is out of place at @entity47 ( left ) while two other young women have apparently forgotten they are in front of @entity50 's @entity51 ( right ) all at sea : @entity53 was lucky to survive this plane crash near @entity55			1
one passenger died jumping in : an apparently suicidal youth is talked down from @entity58 in @entity59 while a woman takes a tactless phone photo too clinical : donning her obligatory scrubs , a @entity34 medic sees this triple bypass as ideal @entity66 material affront : the smiling sunbather posted ' spending time with my nana on this lovely sunday ! ' while holding an urn presumably containing some of her ashes keep calm and carry on posing : meanwhile , there 's mayhem as the jet airliner fills with smoke not waving but drowning : the youth 's in trouble , but the poser is unruffled by the scene			0
