if @entity1 are to topple @entity2 then someone may need to produce the kind of extraordinary performance @entity5 mustered 35 years ago			1
it was 1979 when the vietnam war veteran and eventual three - time major winner won all five points in a @entity11 match , a feat that no other man in history , not even @entity13 , has been able to emulate			1
@entity5 was a rookie and had never even experienced matchplay golf before that match at the @entity17 in @entity18 , where he took down @entity19 four times in three days with the @entity21 at his peak			1
@entity5 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) on their way to victory for the @entity1 in the 1979 @entity11 @entity5 , now 67 , is the only @entity11 player to have won all five points at the tournament speaking on thursday from @entity30 ’s @entity29 , @entity5 , now 67 , talked of his admiration for @entity13 and how he believes the relatively humble beginnings they share is connected with them achieving great things in the team competition			1
‘ it ’s probably not coincidence that we come from similar backgrounds , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ he ’s more outgoing than i was but we are sort of blue - collar players who came through late , which maybe makes you want it more			0
’ while @entity13 ’s rise from the pro shop has been remarkable he has nothing on the story of @entity5 , who only took up the game at 21 once he had come back from serving as an infantryman in @entity52			2
@entity5 faced and beat @entity53 , then considered the world 's best player , four times in 1979 before winning two @entity57 and a @entity58 , @entity5 made his name at the 1979 @entity11 , where he and @entity60 beat @entity19 and @entity61 three times in four - man competition before he beat the @entity21 again in the sunday singles			1
‘ i was a squadron leader in @entity52 and the teamwork and camaraderie aspect came very naturally			0
that also put the pressure of sport into perspective			0
after being in the army i was always just happy to see the sun rise in the morning			0
’ there was no other magic secret to his performance for the 5 - 0 whitewash , which he followed up with a 4 - 0 in the event two years later			1
the @entity1 team won 1979 's @entity11 17 - 11 : back row , standing , left to right - @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 ( captain ) , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ; front row - @entity87 , @entity5 , @entity60 , @entity89 and @entity90 @entity5 went on to win three majors , including this 1983 @entity58 , but made his name first in the @entity11 ‘ it was almost like playing the 18th hole of a major on every hole and that helped my concentration i guess			1
‘ because i did n’t go to college , matchplay was new to me , but my military background helped , ’ he said			0
‘ i kept getting drawn against @entity19 , who was about the world ’s best at that time			2
some were intimidated by him but it was n’t a problem , i was not even intimidated by ( @entity105 ) @entity104			0
‘ i heard things like @entity19 might try and psyche me out or put me off but there was no animosity			2
we actually became quite close after			0
’ @entity5 has continued to play on the @entity110 and will be competing this week			2
but he added : ‘ i will be watching , i still love the @entity11			0
@entity2 are supposed to win , but neither side will think of that once it starts			0
’ @entity5 draws parallels between himself and @entity2 's @entity13 , who excels in the @entity11 's team environment			1

@entity5 beat @entity19 four times in three days in 1979
the @entity1 vietnam war veteran won 5 - 0 in that tournament , a feat not even matched by @entity2 's *current* @entity11 star @entity13
@entity123 legend @entity19 was considered the world 's best player
@entity5 says he and @entity2 's @entity13 have much in common
the @entity11 begins with four *fourball* matches on *friday* morning
