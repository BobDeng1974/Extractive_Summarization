by @entity0 the gunslingers are long gone and tumbleweeds have taken over at this abandoned @entity4 theme park , which has n't seen a cowboy , not even one in fancy dress , for years			2
the saloon bar doors last swung open in 2009 , since when the @entity9 , the @entity10 , and the lawyer 's office , along with the rest of the @entity15 ’s buildings , have been left untouched			0
eerie photographs showing long - gone visitors dressed in cowboy costumes are still pinned to the wooden walls , while dust gathers on the bottles of bourbon still standing on bar - room tables at the tourist attraction at @entity25 , near @entity25 in @entity26			1
a photographer , who uses the name @entity28 and took these pictures , said : ' what was once a happy , bustling and buzzing location has been left to ruin			0
' i ’ve seen some amazing places , but this was something so different from all the rest			0
' what was most interesting was the pictures of the families who visited the park when it was open as they capture the happiness and excitement of the children			1

once full of excited children , the streets of the former tourist attraction are now deserted and *covered* with grass
eerie photographs show how nature is slowly reclaiming what was the @entity124 near @entity25
