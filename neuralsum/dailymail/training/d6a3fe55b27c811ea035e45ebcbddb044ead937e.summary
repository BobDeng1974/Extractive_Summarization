by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 07:00 est , 5 december 2013 defence chiefs controversially delayed introducing a warning system which could have prevented a mid-air collision between @entity5 jets that killed three airmen			1
squadron leader @entity7 and flight lieutenants @entity8 and @entity9 died when two £ 40million @entity11 warplanes crashed during a training mission over north - east @entity13			1
the fighter - bombers , each carrying a pilot and a navigator , spun out of control and plunged into the @entity18 on july 2012			2
killed : flight lieutenant @entity9 , pictured , was one of the men killed in the 2012 crash wreckage : these chunks of the tornado jet planes were recovered from the @entity18 , where the planes crashed last july but the @entity24 yesterday confirmed it had identified a collision warning system for the fast jets four years before the fatal accident			1
and the state - of - the - art £ 53.5million device was not finally approved for the @entity30 until october 2012 - three months after the tragedy			1
military sources said cost - saving in the cash - strapped @entity24 meant the @entity5 was forced to shelve the scheme in favour of other kit			1
an @entity5 board of inquiry has completed a report on last summer 's collision and handed a copy to the procurator fiscal who will decide whether a fatal accident inquiry ( @entity45 ) will be held			2
the board 's findings have not been published			0
the conclusions of the report are understood to be ' problematic ' for defence chiefs , a source told the @entity51			0
last night @entity52 , the @entity53 mp , said the absence of collision avoidance equipment on the @entity30 should be ' an important consideration ' for any inquiry into the doomed aircraft			2
tragic : flight lieutenant @entity8 , left , and squadron leader @entity7 , right , also died in the crash he said : ' no doubt the absence of a collision avoidance system in @entity11 fast jets will be an important consideration and these parliamentary answers from the @entity24 shed light on the issue			1
' as in all tragic cases which involved the death and injury of service personnel our thoughts must be with those directly and indirectly affected			0
' it is imperative that all lessons are learnt from the @entity11 collision over the @entity18			0
' mr @entity52 uncovered the delay in the procurement of collision warning equipment for the fighter jets after asking a series of @entity82			1
defence equipment minister @entity83 confirmed a ' commercial off - the - shelf ' traffic collision avoidance system ' was recommended by the @entity24 in 2008			1
he said the £ 53.5million was approved for installation in october 2012 and a contract for the work required was awarded in december that year			1
tributes : a family lays flowers at @entity93 airbase following the crash the first two jets to be fitted with the system were delivered to the @entity5 in august this year			1
the roll out of the equipment is to be completed by december 2014			2
mr @entity83 said : ' a @entity11 traffic collision avoidance system has been developed which is expected to achieve initial operating capability by the end of next year			2
' insiders in @entity103 said the delay in approving the collision warning system had occurred because of a shortage of cash at the @entity24 the @entity109 - led coalition elected in may 2010 was forced to order the sprawling department to make savings of £ 4.7billion over five years and plug a £ 38billion black hole in funding for the equipment programme			1
' there was only a limited amount of money , ' said one source			0
' if you have n't got it , you ca n't spend			0
' defence chiefs might also have thought twice about spending millions of pounds upgrading warplanes that will be taken out of service in 2018			0
@entity124 : the @entity11 's wheel is visible as the wreckage is retrieved checks : air ground crew work on @entity11 planes at @entity93 in the days following the crash @entity131 , 36 , from @entity132 , flt lt @entity8 , 28 , from @entity133 , @entity134 , and @entity135 , 27 , from @entity136 , died in the accident close to the @entity138 in the @entity18			1
@entity131 @entity139 survived but was badly injured			0
the crew were all from @entity141 based at @entity93			0
they were understood to be taking part in practice bombing runs in fog			0
the @entity11 is a two - seat attack aircraft which is capable of delivering a variety of bombs and missiles , including @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft and a top speed of @entity155			0
the @entity11 has been in service with the @entity5 since 1979 and the frontline squadrons are veterans of a string of conflicts with hundreds of hours flying experience			0
an @entity24 spokesman said : ' there are already a range of mitigation measures in place to minimise the risk of mid-air collision and tragic incidents such as that in @entity18 are extremely rare			2
' a specifically designed @entity171 , which will be another tool for pilots to use , is currently being trialled and will be in service in next year			0

three airmen died when two tornado jets collided over @entity13 in 2012
squadron leader @entity7 and flight lieutenants @entity8 and @entity9 were killed
the @entity24 yesterday said a warning system was planned
but the £ 53.5million equipment was not approved until after the crash
