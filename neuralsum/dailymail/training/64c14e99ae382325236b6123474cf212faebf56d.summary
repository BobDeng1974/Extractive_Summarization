by @entity0 the world 's first male @entity2 cub has been born at a private zoo in @entity5 , @entity6			1
a liliger is the offspring of a male lion and a ligress - which itself is a cross between a male lion and a tigress			1
the adorable cub and his little sister together make up @entity6 's second litter of the rare hybrid animal			1
the children are the offspring of a male lion and a female lioness , which is itself the the product of breeding between a lion and a tiger the are the second set of offspring to come from father @entity32 and mother @entity33 , who had another set of cubs in november last year the little spotted cubs were born in the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity5 on may 31st			1
their parents are @entity32 , a male lion and @entity44 - a female liger who gave birth to @entity6 's first liliger cubs in november last year			1
zoo president @entity48 said : ' one of the biggest purposes of what we 're doing here , crossbreeding animals , is to educate the public			2
' crossbred animals do not produce dead offspring or genetically deformed offspring - inbreeding causes that and there is a big difference			0
' crossbred animals are genetically healthier - there has never been a recorded incident of a deformed crossbred baby			0
zoo president @entity48 ( pictured ) was keen to stress that the animals are crossbred rather than inbred , which means they will not produce dead or deformed offspring ' we have researchers keeping track of the dna and genetics very carefully so we can do this properly - none of this is done artificially			2
' this litter proves that genetically hybrid cats are stronger than pure bred cats - and that they originate from the same species or they would n't be able to produce healthy offspring			0
' the liliger cubs weighed approximately 3.5 pounds and were 11.25 inches long			2
the zoo plans to build a special exhibit of the rare animals , but the new liligers litter will be kept separate from the other cubs for now			2
@entity48 added : ' they will be on exhibit in about six to eight weeks - we 're excited to see their progress			0
' in many countries , such as @entity94 , breeding rare cats such as lions and tigers is illegal as it does nothing to preserve either species			0
the offspring serve no purpose and can not be introduced into the wild , so are usually bred only as a tourist attraction in order to make money for zoos , according to @entity105			0
there are several ligers in @entity6 zoos , but @entity5 are the only zoo to breed liligers , a cross between a male lion and a female liger			1
the gender of the animal decides how the name is formed			0
while ligers are the mix of male lions and female tigers , tigons are male tigers and female lions			1
the controversial world of hybrids also includes ' leopons ' - the spawn of female leopards and male lions , along with several zebra - horse - donkey zebroids such as zorses , zonkeys , and zonies			1
camas are a mix of camels and llamas ; grolars and pizzlies are combinations of polar bears and grizzlies ; and there are also ' wolphins , ' bottlenose dolphins mated with false killer whales .			0
