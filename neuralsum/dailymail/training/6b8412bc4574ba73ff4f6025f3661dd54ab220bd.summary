after an event in a hookah lounge , @entity54 levels were four times higher than normal in hookah smokers and 2.6 times higher than normal among people who had attended but had n't puffed on a hookah			1
after a hookah - smoking event in a private home , @entity54 levels were two times higher among hookah smokers , but normal among nonsmokers			2

studies estimate one hookah session can be the equivalent of smoking from 10 to 40 cigarettes			0
@entity72 believes that ' because there is no safe level of exposure to benzene , our results call for interventions to reduce or prevent hookah tobacco use , regulatory actions to limit hookah - related exposure to toxicants including benzene , and include hookah smoking in clean indoor air legislation			2
' researchers have previously warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookah pipes			2
a study by researchers affiliated with @entity115 's @entity114 and @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , in the august 2014 edition of @entity119 identifies how prevalent hookah use is and which teens are most likely to be using it			2
