scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage			1
when fish eat tapeworm eggs , the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh			2
because sushi is not cooked , the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish			2
once a human is infected , a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks			2
it can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months , in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body			0
symptoms include fatigue , constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong			0
