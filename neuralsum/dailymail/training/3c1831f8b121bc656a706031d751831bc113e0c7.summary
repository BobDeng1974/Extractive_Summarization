by @entity0 @entity2 villagers were left stunned when a flood washed what appears to be a piece of inter-continental ballistic missile onto their doorsteps			0
the fibreglass cylinder floated into the garden of a traffic policeman after floodwaters inundated the village of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
after villagers took photos and circulated them online , speculation grew that the tube could be part of a spaceship fallen to @entity22 , or even an icbm that had been decomissioned and buried nearby			1
but @entity35 , the @entity37 's state - backed international news network , reported that the truth was somewhat more mundane			0
it quoted @entity40 , professor of aero - space engineering at @entity42 , as saying the cylinder was indeed probably a relic of @entity37 's space industry , albeit one that never made it off the planet			1
' that this is an empty body of a rocket engine , presumably left from the @entity52 times on the territory of the @entity55 chemical plant , ' he said			1
' as it 's an empty body with no fuel in it , it poses neither public nor technical danger			2
' such tanks may be handy in households as water collecting and storage containers , or - if dug into the ground - can be used as a sewerage facility			2
' his explanation was backed by a local government official , who said that a family living close to @entity70 had had been using it to store water			1
the chemical plant in @entity55 , @entity15 's second largest city , had previously used such tanks as containers for rocket fuel , @entity35 reported			1
after demand dropped with the fall of the @entity52 , there were plenty of tanks left spare			0
officials say it is a relic of the space industry , but was left spare when local enterprises shut down in the 1990s @entity85 , deputy chief of the @entity86 and @entity87 in @entity15 told @entity88 the rocket part was made of carbon fibre - reinforced polymer			1
he said : ' it is a legacy of of an enterprise closed at the beginning of the 1990s that specialised in filling the shells with fuel			2
' we did had an enterprise that specialised in filling those missiles , which were produced at @entity100 in @entity101			0
the rockets were decommissioned in 1992 - 93 and then scrapped			0
several of the shells were left , but since they were never filled with fuel they were safe and people took them home			2
' we sent a member of staff to go and double check that there is no danger , and he confirmed that this is just an empty shell that has never been filled with fuel and therefore is not dangerous			0
nor is there any issue of secrecy here			0
' @entity117 , whose family owns the tube , told @entity120 that they had bought the tube from the plant			1
she said it got away during the flood			0
' it broke the fence and floated away with the dogs , who were hiding inside , ' she said , adding that now it has become famous they may now auction it off .			0

*mysterious* cylinder appeared during floods in @entity15 , @entity16
speculation as to its origins ran wild after locals posted pictures online
but it turns out it was being used to store water by a family living nearby
they had bought it from an old chemical *factory* that made rocket fuel
