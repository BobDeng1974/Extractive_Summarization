after nearly two years of jockeying with @entity1 over the @entity3 's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups , former official @entity0 wo n't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions			1
@entity11 attorney @entity10 , on his last day in office , told house speaker @entity12 in a seven - page letter that @entity0 could wrap herself in the @entity11 @entity15 's @entity14 , even though she offered a self - serving opening statement before clamming up during a may 22 , 2013 hearing			1
@entity0 has long been in the @entity19 's crosshairs because she led the @entity3 department tasked with approving nonprofit groups ' applications for tax - exempt status			1
beginning in 2010 , the department gave conservative groups with words like ' patriots ' or ' tea party ' in their names extra scrutiny , slow - walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years			1
the @entity33 had subpoenaed @entity0 after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal			2
@entity67 @entity66 rep. @entity66 , then the @entity69 's chairman , told @entity0 in one hearing that she had ' effectively waived your rights ' by defending herself under oath			1
' i have not done anything wrong , ' @entity0 had said in the 2013 hearing			1
' i have not broken any laws , i have not violated any @entity3 rules or regulations , and i have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee			0
' @entity10 told @entity12 on tuesday that since @entity0 had only made ' general claims of innocence , ' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions			1
' ms. @entity89 's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to " testimony " about the actual facts under the @entity33 's review , ' he said			0
' the @entity94 to the @entity15 would provide ms. @entity0 with an absolute defense , should she be prosecuted , , , for her refusal to testify			2
' @entity10 's march 31 letter arrived on @entity98 just a day before his resignation took effect after a five - year stint as @entity53 's top federal prosecutor inside the @entity39			1
president @entity51 named him to his post in december 2009			0
reactions swept through the nation 's capital as word spread that @entity0 was , legally , in the clear			2
' once again , the @entity51 administration has tried to sweep @entity3 targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug , ' @entity12 spokesman @entity108 told @entity114			1
' but unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the @entity118 strikes at the heart of our democracy , and the @entity11 people deserve the truth			0
' ' the @entity33 , ' said @entity108 , ' still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the @entity3 ’ actions			0
' attorney general @entity128 has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel , instead appointing attorney @entity130 to lead an internal probe			0
@entity19 see @entity130 as a politically conflicted choice : @entity134 records show that she donated a total of $ 6,750 to @entity51 ’s campaigns and to the @entity137			0
switch : during the tea party targeting hearings , it was oversight committee ranking @entity143 @entity142 ( left ) who was regularly exasperated – but now @entity66 ( right ) , his @entity19 foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for @entity0 tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax - exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the @entity3 often green - lighted liberal groups in weeks or months @entity66 , whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against @entity0 – and one against @entity128 , for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid			1
' refusing to prosecute mrs. @entity0 and mr. @entity128 after they were held in contempt by a vote of the @entity160 sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to @entity1 and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to @entity1 investigations , ' he said wednesday in a statement			0
@entity66 's successor as chairman of the @entity69 committee , @entity171 @entity168 rep. @entity168 , said @entity10 's letter ' exhibits a disregard for the rule of law ' and scoffed at his objectivity			0
' it is unclear whether the @entity177 directed mr. @entity10 not to prosecute @entity0 , or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with @entity3 ’s leadership , ' @entity168 said			1
' @entity180 will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of @entity11 citizens based on their political beliefs			0
our goal is to ensure that the people responsible , including @entity0 , are held accountable			0
' @entity0 's attorney , @entity188 , said in a statement that his client ' looks forward to moving on with her life			2
' ' it is unfortunate that the majority party in the @entity33 put politics before a citizen 's constitutional rights , ' @entity188 said			0
@entity197 to @entity12 about @entity0 uploaded by @entity198			2

@entity200 sent 7 - page letter to house speaker @entity12 *explaining* why the former @entity3 official was allowed to plead the @entity14
federal prosecutor in charge of the case sent his *decision* to @entity98 on the last day before his own resignation took effect
@entity0 offered a self - serving opening statement during a 2013 hearing , but refused to take questions even though she was under subpoena
hearing *focused* on the @entity3 's habit of targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny based on words like ' patriots ' or ' tea party ' in their names
the @entity39 says she ca n't be prosecuted for defying the subpoena ' because she made only general claims of innocence ' and offered few details
