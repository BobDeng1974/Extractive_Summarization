by @entity0 ' choose your weapon ! ' this might sound like the opening line of a film about ninjas or soldiers but instead , it 's an everyday phrase for the @entity10 's dominatrices - a group who spend their days taking whips , riding crops and canes to their willing clients			1
one of their number is mistress @entity19 , a former prison administrative officer from @entity20 , who agreed to speak to @entity22 as part of his new documentary series , @entity25			1
she 's offering him a close encounter with her arsenal of riding crops and canes , which she intends him to use on her willing ' slave ' standing in a corner , trussed up in full leather bondage wear			1
@entity22 talks to @entity34 in her home in @entity20 he chooses a cane and then watches in fascination as mistress @entity19 wields it with panache , each thwack leaving red stripes on her client 's back			1
' that was a particularly shocking moment , ' he reveals			0
' being in the same room as a dominatrix as she dealt with her client , that is not normally in a day 's work			1
' @entity51 , the director of @entity52 's @entity53 has explored the sex world before in previous documentaries but had never been treated to a live show			1
this time around , the director was determined to find out exactly who was paying for these kind of niche sexual services			0
' we wanted to talk to both @entity19 and her client			1
we spoke to him once the cameras were off and he was n't wearing his gimp mask and he was a perfectly normal , nice , intelligent man			1
' @entity22 with mistress @entity19 in her @entity67 dungeon mistress @entity19 has around 100 clients and says that she could have another ten years in the business the services of mistress @entity19 , who has around 100 regular clients , may come as a shock to those who are unfamiliar with the world of @entity67 , although not quite as much as the latest addition to her repertoire			1
' i 've introduced hard sports into my repertoire ' she tells a curious @entity22			1
' so hard sports is the poo and water sports is the wee			0
i save my waste from the morning then i feed it to my clients			2
there 's a big market for it			2
' astonishingly , mistress @entity19 says there is such a large demand for her waste she even has own website , selling everything from gift vouchers , to toe nail clippings and worn underwear but she says that by far the most popular item on sale is her faeces			1
' i sell a lot , ' she explains			0
' i send it through @entity103 , my first one yesterday went to @entity104 on @entity105 , it was Â £ 25			0
' even mistress @entity19 says that she does n't really understand what her clients get out of it			1
' i 've been in this business for three years and i still ca n't put my finger on why guys want it but all i can say is each to their own , ' she says			0
mistress @entity19 uses a selection of ' weapons ' on her clients ' i never judge anyone because i 've worked in a prison with sex offenders and paedophiles so all i think is that there are far worse things men can be doing			1
' bizarrely , halfway through her interview , @entity19 's mother enters with the promise of a quiche for @entity22 , so what do her family make of her profession			1
' the only way i could have shocked my friends and family is if i had told them i was settling down and having kids , ' she reveals			0
' they were really supportive , especially my mum who even made @entity22 and the crew a packed lunch			2
' @entity19 works seven days a week and never takes any holiday so she 's certainly not lacking in work ethic but will she ever swap the world of the dominatrix for something more mainstream ? ' as a dom , you are expected to be older , and at 44 , i could have another ten years left in me , ' she says , thoughtfully			1
' i do n't think i want to do it for that long though , ' she qualifies			0
' i 'd love to help the street walkers of @entity20 who are vulnerable			2
maybe set up a centre for them			0
but at the moment i love what i 'm doing			0
' mistress @entity19 , @entity22 and her client at her home in @entity20 it 's certainly not for everyone , although @entity154 remains cool throughout - even when confronted with some of the more arcane tools of @entity19 's trade			1
' oh yes , he is completely unembarrassed by anything which is extremely unusual ' says director @entity51			0
' the fact that he is so unfazed makes him completely perfect for the job			0
other people might be worried or scared or concerned about how they look but @entity22 sails through			2
' and the fact that we are shocked by how unfazed @entity22 is makes us question why we are so fazed ourselves			2
' @entity22 believes that sex workers need protecting and we should stop discriminating against them the fact that @entity22 comes across as so nonjudgmental was key to making the sex workers who appear in the documentary feel comfortable enough to share a glimpse into their lives			1
and mistress @entity19 certainly is n't the only unconventional star of the show			1
another is @entity173 , a former builder and father of two , who allows @entity154 to perch on the bed at his home in @entity179 as he prepares to set up a live webcam for 50p a minute online sex			2
@entity173 has been taking female replacement hormones for the past three years but still possesses male genitalia and caters to a very specific type of client			0
as @entity173 begins to provide the service for one of his regular clients , in full view of @entity154 and the @entity52 film crew , he continues to chat - despite the bizarre situation			1
' @entity173 was a very odd situation ' continues @entity193			0
' the film crew were stood in the room , @entity173 was lay on the bed with his legs apart and @entity22 was balanced on the bed looking bemused but not taken aback			2
' that is my job as the director to create an atmosphere that is more relaxing for people like @entity173 so you can achieve a more human reaction			0
' @entity22 himself has strong opinions on the sex trade , confessing to having used male prostitutes himself and says sex workers are in need of support not discrimination			2
' i do n't think it 's an issue - too bad if some people have a problem with buying sex , ' insists the 54 - year - old			1
' they should be so lucky to be buying sex ! selling sex is much more precarious , it 's a terrifying thing to do , but they need support that 's what i really think			0
' @entity22 joins sex worker @entity173 , for a session of online sex despite @entity154 's support for sex work , @entity193 insists that this is not necessarily the message the documentary carries			1
' @entity22 had a very personal view , he was n't an objective reporter , ' he explains			2
' he was passionately interested			0
' however we wanted to make sure that he heard voices of those he did n't agree with and make sure there was a range of views			0
' the programme is undeniably eye opening but does @entity193 believe it will alter the @entity10 attitude to the sex industry ? ' @entity243 will always have a problem with prostitution , ' he admits			0
' and i would n't say that there is no problem ,			0
' it is by no means an enviable profession , but what i do hope is that the programme makes us a little less judgmental			0
' you ca n't assume everyone who 's involved is evil and i hope people think about that			0
' @entity259 : why @entity260 , tonight at 10pm on @entity52			2
