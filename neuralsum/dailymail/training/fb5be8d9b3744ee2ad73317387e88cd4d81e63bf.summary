it came after he was asked by a caller what he made of the prime minister 's urge for pay rises			1
the @entity37 said : ' i think it 's a very good idea , particularly for police officers			1
' he added : ' i think the point he is making … is that as business costs reduce through fuel and other things , our interest rates down that some of the profits that have been made should be shared with their staff			1
' well i do n't suppose that applies to the police but it 's certainly true that our officers and staff have seen fixed salaries now for a number of years and like everyone else has seen their standard of living deteriorate			1
' so anything that would help them i support			0
and if that , if it 's possible to get a pay rise of course we 'd support it			1
' sir @entity0 said the police had only received a below - inflation 1 per cent pay rise last year after ' two to three years of a pay freeze ' following the 2008 recession			1
he added : ' i think it would be helpful , particularly with the @entity73 property market , to make sure that you know our officers are properly rewarded			2
' the police chief 's intervention came after mr @entity18 urged booming businesses to pass on their profits in bigger pay cheques to their staff			1
in an attempt to create an election feed - good factor , the prime minister insisted trading conditions in @entity6 have ' not been this good for a long time ' , and it is time employees saw wage rises after years of a squeeze living conditions			2

sir @entity0 said : ' at this second i must admit i have n't got it with me - it 's an 0800 number , so it 's free ... every other time i 've been in ( to the @entity23 phone - in ) i think i have actually mentioned it			2

mr @entity18 said : ' the most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation , and as the economy continues to grow it 's important this continues and that everyone benefits			1
put simply – it 's time @entity6 had a pay rise			1
' but it comes after years of prices rising faster than pay , leaving families worse off each month			2

the @entity153 's general secretary @entity152 dismissed mr @entity18 's call as ' no more than pre-election mood music '			2
she said : ' since @entity18 became prime minister , the average wage is worth £ 2,500 less a year , the worst fall in living standards since @entity161 @entity160 was on the throne			2
' saying it would be nice if wages went up is no more than pre-election mood music			0
if elected again his policies would do the opposite			0
' huge cuts would take spending back to the same share of the economy as in the 1930s			0
this would depress the economy and mean public sector wages would fall every year			0
on top of that he would make strikes almost impossible , holding back pay across every sector			0
' unite general secretary @entity179 added : ' if @entity18 was serious about giving @entity6 a pay rise then he 'd put his money where his mouth is and immediately boost the minimum wage by at least £ 1.50 an hour with the promise of a living wage			1
instead we have empty words , which do n't put food on the table or pay the rent			0
' @entity192 's general secretary @entity191 said : ' if @entity193 was following @entity18 's lead , he would have implemented the @entity195 pay review body 's recommendations in full last month			1

it is sucking our resources			0
' police presence outside the @entity218 where @entity200 , the @entity201 founder is in hiding @entity201 founder @entity200 has been at the embassy since june 2012 to avoid extradition to @entity223 where he faces questions over claims of sexual assaults mr @entity200 has been at the embassy since june 2012 to avoid extradition to @entity223 where he faces questions over claims of sexual assaults , which he denies			0
