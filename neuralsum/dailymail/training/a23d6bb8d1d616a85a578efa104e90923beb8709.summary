@entity0 will battle @entity1 and @entity2 for the @entity3 in @entity4 on monday night			1
here , @entity5 argues why the @entity7 and @entity8 superstar should be crowned the world 's best player			1
the greatest individual feat in football in 2014 was @entity0 ’s 17 @entity14 goal - haul that smashed the scoring record for one season in the competition and helped @entity7 finally land the their 10th @entity14			1
for so long @entity19 ’s 12 goal - campaign for @entity20 in 2003 had set the bar but then first @entity1 with 15 and @entity0 with 17 took the standard to new levels			2
@entity0 did so in a year when @entity7 finally became the first side in football to win 10 @entity26			1
he did it when the pressure and expectation were on him and that ’s why the @entity31 should win the @entity3			2
@entity0 of @entity7 celebrates after scoring their fourth goal against @entity34 @entity0 's iconic celebration after scoring against their @entity7 rivals in the @entity14 final click here as @entity39 argues why @entity40 superstar @entity1 should win @entity41 seem to want the award to be a further glorification of their @entity44 and would prefer a @entity46 won the prize because they won the @entity44 in @entity48 last summer			1
but the @entity44 is a team event won by the best team , this is an individual honour and just as in 2010 when there was no one @entity53 who stood out above all others in their brilliant @entity44 - winning side , the @entity46 also had no one outstanding individual			0
@entity2 was n’t even the best goalkeeper in the tournament so his place on the podium is contestable			0
if you want to pick a @entity46 player why not the irrepressible @entity63 or the impeccable @entity64 in what was his final major tournament ? or even @entity67 , who has just been voted @entity46 player of the year in his homeland			0
@entity2 was also in goal the night his club side @entity71 were beaten 4 - 0 on their own ground with @entity0 scoring twice in the @entity14 semi-final			1
that was arguably the club performance of the year and @entity0 was at the heart of it with @entity2 the victim			2
@entity0 also shared the @entity79 with @entity80 for his 31 goals and if concerns over his fitness had not meant he had to sit out several key games towards the end of the season he would have scored more and even kept @entity7 in the @entity88 title race			1
@entity2 was n’t even the best goalkeeper in the tournament so his place on the podium is contestable @entity0 kisses his @entity91 as best @entity93 goalscorer in november at the @entity94 click here as @entity96 argues why @entity97 goalkeeper @entity2 should win it was n’t just his goals in 2014			1
he showed leadership and sacrifice working for the side and fully taking on board coach @entity104 ’s demand for team - ethic to override all striving for personal spotlight			0
he let that super-sized ego get the better of him when he scored the last goal in the 4 - 1 @entity14 final win over @entity34 , ripping off his shirt and posing by the corner flag as if he had baked the cake and not just been the one who put the cherry on the top			2
but we should forgive him that – the emotion of winning the club ’s most sought - after piece of silverware on home soil would have got to anyone			0
it ’s true after the rigours of the season he ran out of gas before the @entity44 and the fitness issues and general circus that surrounded him while he was at @entity8 ’s @entity130 training base in @entity132 state stayed in the memory longer than his performances			0
a topless stalker , the @entity48 former ‘ miss bumbum ’ beauty contest winner @entity137 had to be given a restraining order to stay away from him after trying to get to him while he was training and that all made for a very bizarre end to his season , especially when he was unable to let the football take centre - stage once he was back on the pitch			0
after the rigours of the season @entity0 ran out of gas before the @entity148 with @entity8 @entity0 poses during the unveiling ceremony of a statue of himself in his home town but once recovered from the @entity44 he has hit the ground running this season , racing to the 20 - goal mark before most players have worn their new boots in			2
no - one had the perfect year			0
@entity1 won no major honours with @entity40 and is perhaps fortunate to make the podium ahead of @entity160 , who led @entity34 to @entity163 glory , scoring the winner in the match that made them champions , and scoring in the @entity44 for @entity168 against @entity169 as his country qualified from @entity171 ahead of the @entity169 and @entity172			0
@entity173 , who was man of the match in the @entity14 final and a scorer in both the @entity178 final and the @entity44 quarter - finals , could also argue he had a better year than @entity1			0
this is not a ‘ who is the greatest player in the world ? ’ competition			0
if it was , @entity0 might also win it although it would be much harder to separate him and @entity1			2
this is an achievement award for a calendar year in football and @entity0 ’s @entity14 campaign is what should see him scoop his second @entity192			1
@entity0 celebrates with the trophy at the end of the @entity14 final in 2014 after beating @entity34			1

@entity0 's 17 @entity14 goals smashed the record
it helped @entity7 land their 10th @entity14
@entity0 shared the @entity79 with @entity80 for his 31 goals
@entity0 should win the @entity3 for his superb @entity14 run
