it 's been a season to remember for @entity3 fans , as they sealed @entity5 survival for the first time			2
and the @entity3 supporters , who have been superb all season , responded by producing an incredible atmosphere for their final home game of the year			1
the @entity43 faithful had to endure a difficult start to the season as @entity3 faltered under @entity46			0
however , since @entity11 , widely considered to be competing with tonight 's opposite number @entity48 for the @entity51 award , took over , they have put together an incredible run of results , and finish the season comfortably safe			0
on top : goals from @entity56 and @entity57 ( above , left ) extended @entity41 's lead explosion : palace fans were jubliant as they pegged @entity41 back in the second half too far : one fan went overboard , running onto the pitch as @entity11 ' men drew level with @entity41 and the fans seemed determined to celebrate that fact , refusing to let @entity25 's 18th minute header dampen the atmosphere			0
the noise level stayed high as @entity41 went into a three - goal lead in the second half , before the ground erupted as @entity3 staged an incredible comeback .			1
