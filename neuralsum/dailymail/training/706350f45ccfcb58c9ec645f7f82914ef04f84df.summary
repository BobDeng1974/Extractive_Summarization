@entity0 revolutionised how people make calls internationally , but its biggest downfall is that it needs a web connection to work			1
the @entity7 app attempts to rival this by offering calls between countries for the same price as local calls - using submarine cables			1
this means the app bypasses expensive carrier call costs , does n’t ask people to turn on roaming data and the firm claims is typically 25 per cent cheaper than @entity0			1
it converts international calls to local ones using nearby phone networks and after connecting calls to local networks , they are passed through submarine cables when a call is made via the app , @entity7 connects it to a local phone network and assigns it a local number			1
it then switches the call to travel through submarine cables under the oceans			0
these cables are used by carriers , and transport high - speed data around the world			0
when the call reaches the destination country , it is reconnected to the local network again			0
although it assigns the call different local numbers each time , the call appears as if it ’s coming directly from the contact			0
@entity7 is available for @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 devices in 16 countries			1
this includes @entity24 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity27 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity25 and @entity26 users on @entity7 in these countries can then make calls to any destination worldwide , and to any number - the recipient does n't need to have the app installed			1
