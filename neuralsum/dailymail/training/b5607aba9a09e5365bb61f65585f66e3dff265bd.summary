by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 23 october 2013 it is the age old bedroom dilemma : do you get down to it , get it over with – or simply not bother at all ? now , @entity7 researchers say it ’s not as black and white as whether you indulge or not – and the ultimate reason you decide to have sex could heavily influence how happy your relationship is			1
they say in most cases , it ’s better have sex than avoid it – even if you ’re not in the mood			1
@entity7 research has found that we 're happier in our relationships on the days we have sex			1
and that it 's better to have sex than avoid it - even if you 're not in the mood that 's because according to new research , we ’re happier in our relationships on the days we have sex			1
but , more than that , there are two main reasons why couples in a long - term relationship or marriage have sex , the @entity32 reports			1
‘ one thing we wanted to know is whether it really matters to your partner why you want to have sex , as long as they are getting what they want , ' dr @entity40 , a psychologist from the @entity41 from @entity42 , told the @entity32			2
one is positive ( an ‘ approach ’ goal ) – such as to feel closer to a partner			0
the other is negative ( an ‘ avoidance ’ goal ) – basically to avoid an argument or reduce feelings of guilt			2
the categories are then subdivided again into self - focused or partner - focused , dr @entity40 explained to @entity32 journalist @entity60			2
dr @entity40 and her team asked 108 couples to keep diaries , charting daily their levels of desire and sexual satisfaction each day			0
they also had to list the reasons why they had sex over a two - week period			0
after they had sex , each partner answered a questionnaire about their motives – ranging from ‘ to make myself feel better ’ to prevent their partner from feeling rejected and upset			0
each was rated on a sliding scale of importance			0
but having sex out of guilt still does n't bring as much sexual satisfaction			2
even if you think you 're doing your partner a favour , your level of desire will affect how much they enjoy it the researchers found that when sex is wanted for a positive reason – such as to increase intimacy – then we feel happier and more satisfied in the relationship – and this transfers to our partner , increasing their satisfaction , too			1
but having sex out of guilt does n’t bring as much sexual satisfaction – and even if you think you ’re doing your partner a favour , your level of desire will affect how much they enjoy it – and how happy they are in the relationship			1
and contrary to what some people might think , men have guilt sex too			0
‘ men do have higher desire in general , but the motives for sex and the way they make people feel are n't different for men and women , ’ dr @entity40 said			0
the research is published in the journal @entity121 .			0

the reason you decide to have sex - such as to increase intimacy or out of guilt - could heavily influence how happy your marriage is
@entity7 researchers say in most cases , it ’s better have sex than avoid it , as we 're happier on the days we have sex
but having sex out of guilt can reduce satisfaction a partner gets from sex
