by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:52 pm on 22nd june 2011 breach of trust : @entity3 planted the device in an attempt to gain attention a hospital security guard who perpetrated a bomb hoax which shut down an accident and emergency unit and cost the @entity11 £ 218,000 has been jailed for 15 months			1
@entity13 @entity12 heard that @entity14 , 43 , planted the ' realistic ' device just weeks after starting work at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
@entity3 , formerly of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , showed no emotion as the court was told how the ' stupid and frightening ' offence had caused massive disruption which even saw four babies born prematurely			2
almost 80 surgical operations were cancelled due to the near six - hour security alert , which only ended after a controlled explosion carried out by an @entity32 unit drafted in from @entity33			2
passing sentence on @entity3 , judge @entity34 said she believed the former soldier , who was seen apparently attempting to defuse the ' bomb ' in a toilet cubicle , had staged the hoax to seek attention			1
the judge told the father - of - four : ' you were employed as a security officer trusted to keep the hospital safe			2
' this was therefore a gross breach of that trust			2
' criticising @entity3 for failing to alert the authorities that the bomb was not genuine after the alarm was raised , the judge added : ' you were present , you worked at the hospital , you had experience working in security and you knew what would happen			0
' you saw the harm you had caused unfold , and did nothing			0
' non-operational : part of the @entity17 was forced to shut down after the bomb squad was called in @entity3 , who is said to have ' paraded ' in front of camera crews covering the security alert from behind a 100 - metre cordon , covered his face as he arrived at today 's hearing on crutches and with his left arm in a plaster cast			0
it is thought he had been working at @entity17 on a temporary basis for around six weeks when he planted the package , which incorporated black and white wiring and a bottle containing a liquid			0
@entity3 , said by his counsel to be anxious and depressed due to the nature of his work , pleaded guilty in may to placing an article with intent at the hospital at about 8am on november 23 last year			0
the agency worker was charged with the offence in february after wires matching those used in the hoax were found in his garden shed and @entity89 footage exposed him as the only person who could have planted the device			1
the wrong kind of attention : @entity3 pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing into the case @entity97 , prosecuting , told judge @entity98 that @entity3 had used the ' bomb ' to facilitate a crisis where he could be seen to apparently disarm it			1
on the morning of the hospital 's partial evacuation , @entity3 was observed by a mortuary technician to be carrying something under his coat			0
the guard , who served in an infantry regiment in his late teens , then called a colleague to the male toilets in the accident and emergency department and told him the device , which he was seen handling , had ' gone click ' and was ticking			1
a police officer then confirmed that the item , contained in a carrier bag , was an incendiary device and the bomb squad were called			1
mr @entity97 told the court : ' at this stage it was treated as a major incident and the whole department was evacuated			0
' the hospital was then closed , and although certain wards were not evacuated , a total of 678 outpatient appointments had to be cancelled			0
speaking after the sentencing , superintendent @entity128 revealed that the device had appeared to be genuine but was not actually capable of causing an explosion			1
but the officer added : ' this was not just a phone call from a hoaxer - this was a deliberate and elaborate attempt to make people believe that there was a threat			0
' whatever his motive - whether he was an attention seeker or wanted to portray himself as a hero - this was a stupid and potentially dangerous act			1
' @entity146 take hoax calls very seriously and this case shows that we vigorously investigate reports and bring any offenders to justice			0
