ever wanted to dine like a dictator ? we ca n't say we have but now you can thanks to a recipe book which reveals the favourite dishes of some of the world 's most notorious leaders			1
@entity9 ' dinners , a bad taste guide to entertaining tyrants is a cookbook like no other as it reveals the favourite foods of murderous men including @entity16 and @entity17 - and how you can recreate their best - loved dishes at home			1
authors @entity20 and @entity22 describe the book as a ' blend of history , photo album and recipe book ' as they reveal the foods that could sustain a tyrant			1
' the book offers a fascinating insight into the lives of the leaders via the food they ate , as we reveal below ... @entity17 dinners times in the @entity54 communist dictator 's company sound like a @entity56 students ' night out			1
drinking games , food fights and singing and dancing were all commonplace			2
but while students are all about having fun , @entity17 's parties provided another opportunity for him to exert his control , humiliate people and expose their weaknesses			1
enforced merriment : @entity17 used to host raucous dinner parties and one of his starters was satsivi , a type of chicken soup , right singing and dancing was not an expression of joy but a compulsory act enforced by the fearsome leader			2
meanwhile , he would relish drinking his guests under the table to again prove his superiority			2
@entity83 and @entity84 write : '' guess the temperature ' was one of @entity17 's favourite drinking games and reduced many guests to staggering , incontinent wrecks			1
' @entity17 's dinner parties could often last for six hours with the cuisine influenced by his @entity94 roots including food such as walnuts , garlic , plums and pomegranates			1
given his penchant for excess eating and drinking , the authors conclude he 's just as likely to have died from a stroke than poisoning at the age of 75			1
@entity16 @entity83 and @entity84 reveal that while @entity16 had more compassion for animals than he did for people , he was not a devoted vegetarian			1
it was documented on more than one occasion that he ate dishes such as pigeon and liver			2
@entity16 was renowned as a vegetarian but it has been documented that he regularly ate bird meat so the cookbook includes a recipe for squabs , right a @entity56 chef called @entity122 who worked at a @entity124 hotel in the early 1930s confirmed the @entity128 leader 's love of bird meat			1
she told readers of her @entity131 in 1964 : ' i do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab , but you might be interested to know that it was a great favourite with mr @entity16 who dined at the hotel often			1
' such was his fear of being poisoned , @entity16 had 15 food - tasters to ensure his meals were safe for him to eat			1
@entity83 and @entity84 write : ' only after a period of 45 minutes had elapsed without any taster dropping dead was a dish deemed safe for transportation to @entity16 's table			1
' and while people starved during the @entity147 or lived on rations , he carried on feasting like a king			2
the book quotes one of his food tasters , @entity151 , who was struck by the ' superior quality ' of the fuhrer 's meals			1
she said : ' there was asparagus in season , with hollandaise sauce , vegetable broths with little semolina dumplings , roasted red peppers , rice , salads and vegetable stews '			2
@entity165 had dictator @entity165 been given the chance to rule the world he would have made all his subjects eat an @entity170 diet			1
according to the book , he once said that ' @entity173 cooking was worthless and @entity170 the best in the world			1
' @entity165 thought @entity170 food was the best in the world and his family favourite dessert , @entity179 , right , does look tasty but that does n't mean he feasted on pasta and pizza			1
one of his favourite dishes was a less appetising salad of roughly chopped raw garlic , dressed with oil and lemon			2
the authors reveal that @entity165 's tyranny may have ended earlier than 1945 if he had n't made changes to his diet			1
they explained how he was diagnosed with an enlarged liver , heightened blood sugar and a deformed colon but ' a revised diet that included rabbit and chicken brought about a startling improvement			0
' @entity199 fish was a favourite dish of the notorious leader of @entity203 who ruled with a iron fist from 1937 to 2006			2
the books reveals he could eat it at any time of the day and loved it as fresh as possible			1
@entity199 loved his fish cooked fresh so he would often make his staff grill it for him as early as 5am			2
the recipe book reveals how to cook one of his favourites , carp , right they state : ' on occasion , he would rouse his kitchen staff at five or six in the morning to grill some fish he 'd just caught			1
' his callous , murderous attitude was even revealed when he ate as the book reveals how ' once , as he chewed olives he told his former chief of intelligence he was spitting out the stones in " the way i will one day spit out the @entity229 from their land "			1
' @entity231 vain as well as powerful , @entity232 ruler @entity231 had a secret weapon to ensure he always had a pearly white smile - camel milk			0
but @entity83 and @entity84 observe that the beauty treatment came with unfortunate side effects			0
vain : @entity231 used to drink camel milk to enhance the whiteness of his teeth ' the camel milk @entity231 liked to drink may have enhanced the brilliant whiteness of his smile but it seems to have played havoc with his digestion			0
whether he suffered from uncontrollable flatulence or whether , on the other hand , he was able to exploit this affliction to emphasize whatever point he was engaged in making , as demonstrated in an interview with @entity250 , is debatable			0
' certainly , on a visit to his tent in 2004 , @entity251 was advised not to accept a glass of camel milk , lest he be similarly afflicted , ' they write			0
one of his favourite meals was a dish from his home country - camel meat with couscous - but he also had a penchant for @entity170 food - despite banishing @entity263 from @entity232			2
@entity264 the recipe book reveals how the former leader of @entity267 was as fastidious as he was cruel			1
they write : ' hundreds of his luckless people were recruited to the project of preserving his health and vigour by way of his diet			0
a small army of women was employed to see that every grain of rice destined for his plate was uniform in size , shape and colour			0
@entity264 would often feast while his people starved			0
@entity288 's fin soup was one of his favourite dishes but as they are now a protected species , the cookery cook recommends using soy or chicken breast instead ' it then had to be cooked over a fire using only trees cut from a mountain peak near the @entity300 border			2
' he loved sushi and it was once reported he ' enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its " mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing			2
" ' more evidence of his cruelty is shown by the way he had ' live lobsters airlifted to his train as it crossed @entity317 on its way to @entity319 ... and he had food grown for him alone , while @entity267 starved			0
