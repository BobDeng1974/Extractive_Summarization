@entity6 was fishing with his father , @entity7 , at one of their favourite fishing spots near @entity11 off @entity12 - south of @entity13 at 9am on wednesday when some unexpected drama interrupted the beautiful calm day			1
@entity6 was filming his father , @entity7 , who had just hooked a salmon and was about to reel in the fish , when a four - five metre great white shark appeared and all hell broke loose			1
the fierce impact saw both @entity6 , still filming , and his father hit the deck and the shark left its teeth marks behind on the side of the boat as a lasting memory			1
' it touched my right knee with what must have been its nose or fin - that 's how it close was , ' he said			0
' it happened so quickly that i did n't have time to be scared			0
' the 27 - year - old said it was n't until he watched the footage that he realised how surreal the moment was			0
' looking at it now i realise how insane it is - i thought " holy cr * * " , ' he said			0
' i was just taking a photo of dad and the shark photo - bombed , ' he said			2
then we drove away as it drifted off			0
' @entity6 , who has been fishing for at least 20 years , said he had seen endless sharks in his time but not such a physical encounter			2
