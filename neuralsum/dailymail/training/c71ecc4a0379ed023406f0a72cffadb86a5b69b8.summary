harrowing : campaigner @entity0 said an @entity2 girl had been raped by 30 men during a six - hour attack			1
( @entity6 picture ) a teenage girl was groomed and raped by up to 30 @entity2 men - including a father and his schoolboy son - during an horrific sex attack lasting six hours , an inquiry heard			1
campaigner @entity14 detailed abuse of the young vulnerable @entity2 girl in a shocking report highlighting how rife grooming was within ethnic communities			1
she claimed that sexual exploitation and grooming of young @entity2 girls by men of the same ethnic origins was happening under the noses of authorities - with community leaders , schools and families are all too ready to dismiss the attacks or even cover them up			1
@entity31 and women 's rights activist ms @entity0 used the harrowing @entity33 case , involving a teenage girl who was allegedly raped by between 20 to 30 men , to call on authorities to do more to tackle the issue			1
the attack was said to have taken place over six hours and included a father and son , who was in school uniform , and taxi drivers who turned up in groups			0
the report , presented to @entity46 , followed interviews with 35 victims , as well as several sex attackers from @entity31 communities throughout the @entity51			1
ms @entity0 also challenged the popular view that grooming and exploitation , as in high - profile cases in @entity56 and @entity57 , was mainly carried out by gangs of @entity2 men abusing white girls			1
' people tell me they have heard about @entity56 and @entity57 and see it as something which happens elsewhere to other people , but it is happening in @entity33 , it 's happening everywhere , ' she said			0
this warning came in the same week as a child sex gang was jailed for abusing young girls			1
judge @entity71 said the four @entity73 men and boys and an @entity76 kurd had ignored the responsibilities of living in this country as he sentenced them for raping and sexually assaulting five girls aged as young as 12			2
abusers : @entity81 , left , and @entity82 were part of a gang jailed for a total of 54 years at the @entity86 in @entity87 for raping and sexually abusing girls as young as 12 in @entity89 widespread : gang members @entity91 and @entity92 were jailed in the same week as a campaigner highlighted the shocking scale of abuse of children in ethnic communities across @entity51 four of the gang members were from the @entity98 and @entity99			1
two of the victims were @entity98 and @entity99 , while the other three are @entity103			0
last year , seven @entity57 men , mostly of @entity106 heritage , were convicted at the @entity86 of running a paedophile sex ring			0
that trial had followed another , almost exactly 12 months earlier , concerning nine @entity2 men based in @entity56			1
ms @entity0 said girls are more likely to be targeted by people of the same ethnic and cultural background			2
mps said public officials must stop ' tip - toeing ' around race when tackling child sex gangs and claimed that there is a trend of @entity2 gangs targeting youngsters			1
a dangerous trend of @entity106 men grooming young white girls does exist , according to a @entity126 home affairs committee report in june 2013			2
police , prosecutors and social workers must be able to raise the issue without fear of being accused of racism , the committee said			0
but it warned against stereotyping offenders because there is no straightforward link between race and child sexual exploitation			0
in shocking conclusions to a year - long inquiry , mps said there were still areas where victims were being failed by the authorities			0
@entity56 and @entity148 councils were accused of being ' inexcusably slow ' to realise sex abuse was taking place on their doorstep			0
and they said both councils had a ' woeful lack of professional curiosity ' and were responsible for the ' appalling consequences of their indifference to the suffering of vulnerable children '			0
they may also be particularly vulnerable to abuse as they can be blackmailed into keeping quiet because of the risk of ' bringing shame ' on a community , she added			2
when abuse is revealed some families are more likely to send the daughter abroad or hastily arrange a wedding to get rid of the problem rather than face it , the report claims			1
' the biggest barrier that we need to address is the shame and honour card , ' ms @entity0 said			2
' they would rather protect the honour of the family and community than report an offender and protect other girls , as well as get the victim the counselling and help they need			2
' she also added attitudes of young boys and men needed to change as often they did not see what they did as rape , and had no awareness of the impact of their actions on women			0
members of the council enquiry are considering new measures including raising the issue with parents or teenagers through secondary schools and encouraging greater use of relationship education			0
@entity211 councillor @entity210 said : ' i have seen this presentation three times and each time i get angrier and angrier			0
there are a number of issues in the south @entity2 community which are swept under the carpet and this is one of them			2
' inquiry chairwoman @entity222 added : ' when we are dealing with child sexual exploitation we need to recognise that it is not only @entity2 men grooming white girls			1
the victims do not come from any one particular culture or community , and neither do the perpetrators			0
the inquiry will take further evidence in march before compiling a report for the city council .			0
