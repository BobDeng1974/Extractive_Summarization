if an @entity2 biomarker is present in minute concentrations , it causes tiny gold nanoparticles to clump together in an irregular pattern that turns the solution blue a test for @entity2 that is 10 times more sensitive and a fraction of the cost of current methods , has been developed by @entity12 scientists			1
it uses nanotechnology to give a result that can be seen with the naked eye by turning a sample red or blue			1
developed by scientists at @entity20 in @entity21 , the technique offers the promise of better diagnosis and treatment in the developing world			0
research leader @entity26 , said : ' our approach affords for improved sensitivity , does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper			2
' simple and quick hiv tests that analyze saliva already exist but they can only pick up the virus when it reaches relatively high concentrations in the body			2
' we would be able to detect infection even in those cases where previous methods , such as the saliva test , were rendering a ' false negative ' because the viral load was too low to be detected , ' @entity26 said , after the research was published in the journal @entity46			2
the test could also be reconfigured to detect other diseases , such as sepsis , @entity50 , @entity51 and malaria , @entity26 said			0
testing is not only crucial in picking up the virus that causes @entity55 early but also for monitoring the effectiveness of treatments			0
' unfortunately , the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce , ' @entity26 said			1
research leader : @entity26 said she is planning to work with not - for - profit global health organisations to distribute the new sensor according to 2010 data from the @entity68 , about 23 million people living with @entity2 are in @entity69 out of a worldwide total of 34 million			1
the virus is also spreading faster and killing more people in this part of the world			0
@entity75 accounted for 1.9 million new cases out of a global total of 2.7 million in the same year , and 1.2 million out of the 1.8 million deaths			0
the new sensor works by testing serum , a clear watery fluid derived from blood samples , in a disposable container for the presence of an hiv biomarker called p24			1
if p24 is present , even in minute concentrations , it causes the tiny gold nanoparticles to clump together in an irregular pattern that turns the solution blue			1
a negative result separates them into ball shapes that generate a red color			0
the researchers also used the test to pick up the biomarker for @entity99 called @entity100 , which was the target of previous work that @entity26 did with collaborators at @entity104 in @entity105			0
that sensor used tiny gold stars laden with antibodies that latched onto the marker in a sample and produced a silver coating that could be detected with microscopes			1
@entity26 and her collaborator on the new test , @entity115 , said they plan to approach not - for - profit global health organizations to help them manufacture and distribute the new sensor in low - income countries .			0

@entity2 sensor is 10 times more sensitive and a fraction of the cost of current methods
if virus is in blood sample makes tiny gold nanoparticles form irregular patterns , which changes colour of fluid to blue
if no virus present solution turns red
