by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 22 august 2013 @entity2 : 13:35 est , 22 august 2013 an eerie song that helped children on a @entity6 lifeboat block out the cries of the dying can be heard once again			2
the song came from a musical toy pig that belonged to @entity10 , an @entity11 fashion journalist , who was 32 at the time of the tragedy			1
@entity10 and her pig survived the sinking in april 1912 , but unfortunately the mechanism that played the music did n’t			1
now the @entity18 has fixed the musical toy and made a recording of the song 101 years after the event			1
@entity10 and her pig survived the sinking in april 1912 ' it was one of those goosebump moments , ' @entity26 , a curator at the museum , told @entity30 about the tune			1
' we never expected it would have been possible			2
it was tremendously exciting and eerie at the same time			2
' researchers only played the song a few times to prevent further damage to the toy , and made the recording in the hope that the public could identify the tune			1
in a 1970 interview , ms @entity10 described how she refused to evacuate the @entity6 at first , and it was her musical pig that saved her			1
‘ i never would have left the ship , ’ she said , ‘ but a sailor came along and he said : “ say you ; you do n’t want to be saved , well i ’ll save your baby ” and he grabbed this pig from under my arm and he tossed it in the lifeboat			0
’ ms @entity10 followed the pig into the lifeboat and , during the seven hours before being rescued , comforted children on board with the tune			1
@entity61 ( right ) who plays the part of @entity63 ( left ) , owner of the lucky pig , in the 1958 film ' a night to remember ' during the seven hours before being rescued from the @entity6 ( pictured ) , @entity66 and her musical pig comforted children onboard a nearby lifeboat as the pig could not be opened without causing irreparable damage , the team at the @entity18 used high resolution x-ray equipment to examine the internal components			1
the toy was scanned twice ; the first to pick out the details of the main body and a second to obtain good images of the musical movement			1
they found that pig ’s body was constructed from organic material , wood and papier maché			0
mr @entity26 explained that to scan the movement , the lower energy radiation had to be filtered out by placing a small copper sheet in the path of the x-rays before they met the object			0
the rendered dissection showing the inner surface of the carcass			0
the pig 's body was constructed from organic material , wood and papier maché the scan revealed the tail was a knotted piece of vellum that was never connected to the music box			0
initially , the team thought the music was spring - driven and activated by pulling the tail			0
but the scans showed it was actually a hand - powered type of movement			2
‘ by slicing across the width of the model the cause of a rattling noise was identified as a hairpin , probably used in attempt to reconnect to the music box after the crank had broken away , ’ said mr @entity26 , in his blog			0
‘ the s - shaped object in the centre appears to be the original crank - handle and tail			0
‘ detailed examination of this object shows it to be a skin - covered metal tube , which is an unexpected and very exciting find , perhaps a case for key - hole surgery , ’ added mr @entity26			0
as the pig could not be opened without causing irreparable damage , the team at the @entity18 used high resolution x-ray equipment to examine the internal components the second scan showed a toothed wheel attached to the pin barrel , which was driven by a worm gear on the end of the crank shaft			1
the comb was marked with a distinctive star logo , which the team are now hoping will help them identify the maker			2
‘ what has been shown here is only the beginning of the study ; these 3 - d models provide invaluable information that will assist with our curatorial questions as well as the long - term care and conservation of these extraordinary objects , ’ said mr @entity26			0
the pig came to the museum as part of the @entity161 - @entity160 collection in 2003 .			0

the toy belonged to @entity10 , an @entity11 fashion journalist
@entity18 has now used x-ray scans to help fix musical toy
a recording has been made in the hope that public can identify the tune
