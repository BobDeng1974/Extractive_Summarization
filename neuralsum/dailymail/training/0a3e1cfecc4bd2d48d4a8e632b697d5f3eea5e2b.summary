so much plastic is dumped into the sea each year that it would fill five carrier bags for every foot of coastline on the planet , scientists have warned			1
around 8million tons of plastic bottles , bags , toys and other plastic rubbish ends up in the world ’s oceans each year			1
the ‘ staggering ’ total is much higher than previous estimates – and enough to leave an area around 25 times the size of @entity18 ankle - deep in plastic waste			2
because of the difficulties in working out the exact amount , since much of it may have sunk , the scientists said the true figure could be as much as 12.7million tons polluting the ocean each year			1
dr @entity36 , one of the researchers from the @entity38 in the @entity39 , said we are becoming ‘ overwhelmed by our waste ’			1
more than half of the plastic waste that flows into the oceans comes from just five countries : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
the only industrialized western country on the list of top 20 plastic polluters is the @entity39 at no. 20			1
the @entity39 and @entity49 are not mismanaging their collected waste , so the plastic trash coming from those countries is due to litter , researchers said			1
while @entity25 is responsible for 2.4 million tons of plastic that makes its way into the ocean , nearly 28 percent of the world total , the @entity39 contributes just 77,000 tons , which is less than 1 percent , according to the study published thursday in the journal @entity60			1
the team also warned that this ‘ ocean of plastic ’ can harm sea life			2
turtles can mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them			2
the bags then block their stomachs , which causes them to starve to death			2
sea birds also often mistake floating plastic for food ; over 90 per cent of fulmars found dead around the @entity76 have plastic in their stomachs			0
it is also feared that it could harm our health to eat fish that have consumed plastic			0
the scientists reached their figures by analysing data on the amount of waste generated and how well it is disposed of in 192 coastal countries			0
this included litter left on beaches as well as plastic from fly - tipping and badly - managed rubbish dumps			0
their figures are much higher than those from previous studies , which only looked at rubbish floating on the surface and did not factor in the plastic that had sunk to the sea floor or was trapped in ice			0
they estimated that between 4.7million and 12.7million tons of plastic made its way into the world ’s oceans in 2010 , with a best estimate of 8million tons			1
the figure is expected to rise each year			1
between 2010 and 2025 , some 155million tons of plastic could be dumped into the ocean – enough to fill 100 bags per foot of coastline			2
piled one on top of the other , the bags would create a wall of rubbish 100ft high			0
@entity25 topped the league of plastic polluters , accounting for up to 3.5million tons a year , or almost a quarter of the total , the @entity124 of @entity60 ’s annual conference in @entity126 , @entity127 , heard			1
writing in the journal @entity60 , dr @entity36 said that while the @entity132 is n’t among the worst polluters , we can not be complacent , adding that global action is needed to tackle the problem			0
co-author @entity136 , associate professor of industrial ecology at the @entity138 , @entity139 , said : ‘ large - scale removal of plastic marine debris is not going to be cost - effective and quite likely simply unfeasible			0
‘ this means we need to prevent plastic from entering the oceans in the first place through better waste management , more reuse and recycling , better product design and material substitution			0
’ the scientists , from the @entity38 in the @entity39 , used data on the amount of waste generated and how well it is disposed of in 192 coastal countries to come up with their estimates			1
here , @entity36 of the @entity38 collects plastic samples from a beach near @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , november 2014			0
@entity163 dumped on a beach near @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , november 2014 co-author @entity136 , associate professor of industrial ecology at the @entity138 , @entity139 , said : ‘ large - scale removal of plastic marine debris is not going to be cost - effective and quite likely simply unfeasible			0
‘ this means we need to prevent plastic from entering the oceans in the first place through better waste management , more reuse and recycling , better product design and material substitution			0
’ @entity175 , director of the @entity176 in the @entity39 , said : ‘ the numbers are staggering but the problem is not insurmountable			1
’ the @entity179 has been campaigning for seven years for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste			0
a major victory came in june last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in @entity185			2
the charge , which will be introduced by october , is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £ 100million a year for good causes			2
around eight billion bags are currently handed out in @entity185 each year – or 150 per person			2
campaigners say the carrier bags can take up to 1,000 years to degrade – but are used on average for just 20 minutes			0
@entity36 , an environment engineering professor at the @entity38 , holds a plastic bag with trash collected last fall from a clean up at @entity198 in @entity199			0
each year about 8.8 million tons of plastic ends up in the world oceans , a quantity much higher than previous estimates , according to a new study that tracked marine debris from its source			1

@entity25 topped the league , accounting for up to 3.5 million tons a year
other main *offenders* are @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29
@entity39 contributes just 77,000 tons , which is less than 1 *%*
