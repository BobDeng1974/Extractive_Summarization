by @entity0 two fishermen were stunned after they caught two albino lobsters in the space of a week - despite the rare crustacean being one in 100 million			1
@entity6 caught a white lobster off @entity8 , less than a week after @entity9 caught one about a mile off the @entity10 in @entity11			1
the unusual lobsters are extremely rare and look translucent compared with the more usual green and brown lobsters which most people are more familiar with			1
rare : two rare albino lobsters flank a rare yellow lobster on a deck in @entity8 , @entity11 the haul came as a surprise for lobsterman @entity9 , who has 300 traps off @entity22 and has been catching lobsters since 1990			1
it seems that he has been on a roll of late and also caught a yellow lobster on monday , estimated to be one in 30 million , but that was n’t the first time that that had happened			2
however , when he saw the white lobster in his trap he said that he was ‘ surprised and shocked			1
’ but despite his rare find , there was some debate about the exact breed of the lobsters			1
the white shells naturally led to the conclusion that the lobsters were ultra-rare albinos			1
@entity40 , executive director of the @entity42 ’s @entity41 said he ’s only seen a couple of albino lobsters in his lifetime			2
translucent : in this photo provided by @entity49 , two albino lobsters sit in a crate with other lobsters he told the @entity53 : ‘ we get blues ( and ) we get red ones every summer			2
that ’s not a big deal			0
this is if they ’re actually albino			0
’ on closer inspection , @entity40 said , it seemed at least one , if not both , have a blueish hue			0
‘ i do n’t think they ’re albinos			0
it looks like there ’s some pigmentation there			0
still , whatever they are is highly unusual , it ’s nothing i ’ve seen before			0
’ a true test of their colour would be to feed the white lobsters food high in carotenoids , like crab and periwinkles because this type of food will darken the shell , if they ’re not albino			2
and if they are cooked , true albinos would stay white , say experts			1
both white lobsters were under legal size and about 5 or 6 years old according to @entity86 , owner of the @entity87 , where the fishermen brought their rare catches			1
blue lobster : this photo provided by @entity92 shows a blue lobster caught by her father @entity94 off @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity11 normally , that would mean they ’d have to be thrown back into the ocean to mature for two years – but seeing as they are so rare that ’s probably not going to happen			1
one of the white lobsters has already been snapped up by @entity104 , a @entity106 lobster supply store			1
the other will go to the @entity108 in @entity109 , adding to the spectrum of coloured lobsters already on display there			0
last month , two blue lobsters were caught in @entity97 and were taken to the @entity115 aquarium			2
blue lobsters are estimated by the @entity41 to be one in 2 million			0
earlier this year , a lobsterman pulled a one - in - 30 million calico lobster in @entity119			0
it was sent to a @entity122 aquarium			0
in late july , a yellow lobster ended up in a supermarket tank in @entity125 , where a customer bought it and sent it to an aquarium in @entity130 , @entity119			0
but none compare to the ultra-rare albinos			0
if any more are found , experts suggest that there could be some unusual breeding in the area			2
