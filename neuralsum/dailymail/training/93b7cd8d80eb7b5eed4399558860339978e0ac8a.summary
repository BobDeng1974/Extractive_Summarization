a truly captivating map that shows the ancestry of everyone of the 317 million people who call the melting pot of @entity6 home can now be seen on a @entity8 map			1
for decades , the @entity9 opened its doors and welcomed with open arms millions of immigrants who all arrived through @entity15 's @entity14 in the hope of a better life in @entity6			1
indeed , the inscription on the @entity19 in @entity15 's harbor reads ' give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to be free ' and the fascinating map identifies the truly diverse nature of the @entity9 in the 21st century			2
although the 2010 census left out questions about ethnicity , this map shows how it looked in 2000 , according to @entity31			2
melting pot : this map shows the ethnic heritage of @entity35 49,206,934 @entity36 by far the largest ancestral group , stretching from coast to coast across 21st century @entity6 is @entity39 , with 49,206,934 people			1
the peak immigration for @entity36 was in the mid- 19th century as thousands were driven from their homes by unemployment and unrest			0
the majority of @entity39 can now be found in the the center of the nation , with the majority living in @entity50 , @entity51 and according to @entity52 , famous @entity39 - @entity35 include , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
indeed , despite having no successful @entity61 colonies , the first significant groups of @entity39 immigrants arrived in the @entity9 in the 1670s and settled in @entity15 and @entity63			1
@entity36 were attracted to @entity6 for familiar reasons , open tracts of land and religious freedom and their contributions to the nation included establishing the first kindergartens , @entity71 trees and hot dogs and hamburgers			1
41,284,752 black or @entity35 the census map also identifies , @entity35 or @entity35 as a term for citizens of the @entity9 who have ancestry in @entity78			1
the majority of @entity35 are descended from slaves from @entity81 and @entity82 and of course have become an integral part of the story of the @entity9 , gaining the right to vote with the 15th amendment in 1870 , but struggling with their civil rights for at least another century			1
predominantly living in the south of the nation where they were brought to work on the cotton plantations and as slaves in the late 18th to mid- 19th centuries , @entity35 or @entity35 also have sizable communities in the @entity96 area of @entity97 and @entity98 , @entity99			1
35,523,082 @entity100 another group who joined the great story of the @entity9 were the @entity100 and the great famine of the 1840s sparked mass migration from @entity107			0
it is estimated that between 1820 and 1920 , 4.5 million @entity100 moved to the @entity9 and settled in the large cities like @entity15 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity96 and @entity112			2
currently , almost 12 percent of the total population of the @entity9 claim @entity100 ancestry - compared with a total population of six and a half million for the @entity116 and @entity107 today			1
@entity100 residents of note include @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 and 35,523,082 people call themselves @entity100			0
31,789,483 @entity123 and from 1990 to 2000 , the number of people who claimed @entity123 ancestry almost doubled in size to 31,789,483 people			2

26,923,091 @entity140 the next largest grouping of people in the @entity9 by ancestry are those who claim to be @entity145			1
predominantly found in the @entity146 and @entity81 , the number of people directly claiming to be @entity145 has dropped by 20 million since the @entity148 because more citizens have started to identify themselves as @entity35			1
they are based predominantly in the northeast of the country in @entity153 and in @entity154 , where the majority of @entity157 immigrants moved in the middle 19th century			0
notable @entity35 people with @entity140 ancestry are @entity160 and @entity161 and 26,923,091 people claim to come from the land of the original @entity164			1
19,911,467 @entity35 the surprising number of people across the nation claiming to have @entity35 ancestry is due to them making a political statement , or because they are simply uncertain about their direct descendants			1
indeed , this is a particularly common feature in the south of the nation , where political tensions between those who consider themselves original settlers and those who are more recent exist			2

1886 17,558,598 @entity191 one of the most influential nationalities to migrate in large numbers to the @entity9 were the @entity194			0
between 1880 and 1920 , more than 4 million @entity191 immigrants arrived in the @entity9 forming ' @entity196 ' wherever they went			2
bringing their food , culture and entertainment to the nation , another large wave of @entity191 immigrants arrived in the country following @entity204 , bringing the total number today to 17,558,598 people			1
9,739,653 @entity207 the largest of the @entity210 groups to live in the @entity9 , @entity207 @entity35 were some of the earliest @entity213 colonists to the @entity61			1
up to 2.5 million @entity214 came to the @entity9 between the mid- 19th century and @entity215 and flocked to the largest industrial cities of @entity15 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity96			2
in many states , the @entity221 population doubled between the 2000 and 2010 census			0
in @entity225 , @entity224 outstripped whites for the first time , reaching 46 per cent compared to 40 per cent			0
9,136,092 @entity228 historically , along with the @entity140 , the @entity228 colonized @entity6 first and successfully in the @entity229 in the border areas alongside @entity231 and in the south around @entity233 and @entity234			0
@entity14 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity15 , @entity9 --- a portrait of @entity207 and @entity210 immigrant women wearing @entity240 tags at the turn of the 20th century the figures reveal the changing face of the @entity9 , with the number of @entity224 up by 15 million by the 2010 census , from these figures in 2000			0
hispanic children now account for one in four @entity35 youngsters as a portrait emerges of a country with an aging white population and rapid minority growth			2
while @entity221 communities cover a swath of states from @entity257 to @entity258 , @entity35 @entity253 are more dispersed , with pockets of populations in states including @entity51 , @entity225 , @entity262 and the @entity263 , with a higher concentration in @entity265			2
the map also reveals a concentration of people stating @entity35 as their ethnic heritage , mostly in the @entity270			1
many may have stated @entity35 on the census form as a political statement , or because they have a mixed or unknown heritage , according to @entity52			1
while the @entity9 has its roots in being a welcoming place for immigrants , that has n't always been the case			0
as a wave of new arrivals flooded @entity9 shores in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , but a movement to restrict who was allowed into the country took hold as well			0
in 1882 , @entity287 enacted the @entity288 , the first major federal law to put immigration limits in place and the only one in @entity35 history aimed at a specific nationality			2
it came into being in response to fears , primarily on the @entity297 , that an influx of @entity300 immigrants was weakening economic conditions and lowering wages			0
it was extended in 1902			0
other laws followed , like the @entity305 , which created an " @entity305 " to restrict immigration from that part of the world , and the @entity309 of 1921 , which limited the number of immigrants from any country to 3 percent of those people from that country who had been living in the @entity9 as of 1910			2
the @entity316 capped the number of immigrants from a particular country at 2 percent of the population of that country already living in the @entity9 in 1890			0
that favored immigrants from northern and western @entity213 countries like @entity324 over immigrants from southern and eastern @entity213 countries like @entity194			0
@entity14 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity15 , @entity9 --- immigrants stand with members of the @entity15 @entity329 @entity14 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity15 , @entity9 : immigrants on line leaving @entity14 waiting for ferry to @entity333 it also prevented any immigrant ineligible for citizenship from coming to @entity6			0
since laws already on the books prohibited people of any @entity342 origin from becoming citizens , they were barred entry			0
the law was revised in 1952 , but kept the quota system based on country of origin in the @entity9 population and only allowed low quotas to @entity342 nations			0
the @entity35 children of @entity191 and other @entity213 immigrants saw that law " as a slur against their own status " and fought for the system to be changed , said @entity358 , professor of history and @entity360 at @entity361			1
in fighting for change , they looked to the civil rights movement			0
the political leaders who agreed with them saw it in the same terms , as a change needed for equality 's sake , as well as to be responsive to shifting relationships with nations around the world			1
speaking to the @entity374 on @entity375 in june 1963 , president @entity119 cited the " nearly intolerable " plight of those who had family members in other countries who wanted to come to the @entity9 and could be useful citizens , but were being blocked by " the inequity and maldistribution of the quota numbers			0
" two years later , in signing into law a replacement system that established a uniform number of people allowed entry to the @entity9 despite national origin , president @entity385 said it would correct " a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the @entity35 nation			1
" @entity394 , sociology professor at @entity395 in @entity135 , said the civil rights movement " was the main force that made that viciously racist law come to be perceived as intolerable , " precisely because it raised questions about fairness and equality .			0
