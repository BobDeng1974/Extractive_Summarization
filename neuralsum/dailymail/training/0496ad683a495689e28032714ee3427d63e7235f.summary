over the course of five years , @entity2 siphoned over £ 100,000 from the resident 's account without her knowledge			1
he used the money to pay for his addiction , which his family was unaware of , as he spun a web of lies to hide his financial affairs			2
@entity2 was well thought of in the nursing profession , having obtained his diploma in 1997 , but he began gambling at university and it had become ' a pathological addiction '			1
he made cash withdrawals from atms using mrs @entity3 ’s debit card which was kept , along with her personal identification number , in a safe at the care home			1

' @entity2 looked down in the dock as mr @entity71 sentenced him to three years in prison , of which he will serve half before being eligible for release			2
mr @entity71 added : ' @entity3 , who is now 80 , was living at @entity15			1
she was under your care and she was vulnerable			0
she had little financial know how and i have no doubt she must have appeared to you an easy target			0
jailing @entity2 , the judge said his behaviour was as ' gross a breach of trust as it is possible to imagine '			2
he said : ' elderly vulnerable people are regrettably far too often the target of fraudsmen and the court has got to make it plain that anyone who takes part in this deliberate behaviour will be severely punished			0
' you had an extensive and long - standing gambling addiction which a report tells me has been the driver of your offending			2
doubtless it was but that in reality it amounts to little in mitigation			0
' defending @entity2 , mr @entity109 said : ' this was a man being driven to distraction by the pathological addiction to gambling			1
it was running his life			0

' ' whether he stole the money for gambling or whatever it does n’t matter			0
the fact of the matter remains that he stole money from a vulnerable , old woman			0
she went into the home just before her husband ’s death five or six years ago			0
