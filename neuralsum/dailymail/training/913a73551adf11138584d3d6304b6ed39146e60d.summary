residents of @entity1 , @entity2 , raged today during the first session of the commission looking into the violence that has torn their community apart			1
they sat through three hours of talks before exploding and telling the panel : ' you do not reflect the community we live in ! ' they shouted : ' where were you when @entity16 was burning ? ’ and told the white commissioners they would never understand			1
community affair : dozens of angry , frustrated people attended the first @entity22 meeting held at the @entity23 monday emotions running high : members of the audience sat through the first three hours of the six - hour meeting before verbally attacking the panel post mortem : the commission has been set up by @entity2 governor @entity31 to examine the aftermath of the @entity34 shooting a post-it note put on the wall read : ' start by calling the killing of @entity34 what it was : a lynching			1
it was done to intimidate and “ keep blacks in their place			0
” ’ the six - hour meeting took place at the @entity23 , a short distance away from @entity46 , which was looted and burned last week after a grand jury announced it would not indict @entity1 police officer @entity48			1
@entity48 , who is white , shot dead unarmed 18 - year - old @entity34 , who was black , on august 9 , sparking more than a week of protest and rioting			1
