@entity0 won her second @entity2 title on saturday but it was @entity5 @entity4 who claimed the hearts of the @entity2 crowd after pushing the 27 year - old @entity9 to the brink of defeat			1
@entity0 had to use every grain of her experience and fighting capabilities – plus some highly dubious stalling tactics – to complete a 6 - 4 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 victory that stretched to just over three hours on a steaming afternoon			1
while lacking much variety it was a fine contest of baseline slugging and retrieving , only marred by the weak officiating of @entity24 umpire @entity23 , who failed to crack down on the timewasting that continually forced the @entity5 to adjust her pace of play			0
aloft : @entity0 holds her @entity2 trophy to show the crowd @entity32 : @entity33 pushed her all the way in an epic match @entity36 : @entity0 wins her second @entity2 title after beating @entity5 's @entity4 @entity0 , who took an eight minute break to change her dress after losing the second set tiebreak , went two hours and 24 minutes before @entity23 finally gave her a warning about taking too much time between points			1
nonetheless you can only admire her remarkable fighting instinct which saw her win her fourth three set match in succession and none more gruelling than this			0
the 27 year - old @entity9 returns to @entity50 in a fortnight ten years after winning the title there			1
you could hardly have expected then that she would win two @entity2 trophies without adding to hear haul at @entity56			2
' i would n’t have believed seven or eight years ago that i would win here more than at any other slam , it was like a dream for me to win here at all , ' said the champion			0
business time : @entity0 and @entity4 entering the arena ahead of their @entity2 final pre-game : @entity0 and @entity4 pose for pictures at the net ahead of their showdown doubling up : @entity0 was aiming for her second @entity2 title , after winning there in 2012 breakthrough : @entity4 , meanwhile , was in her first ever @entity75 final @entity76 : the rangy @entity9 was too much for her opponent in the first set , winning it 6 - 4 she becomes the twelfth female player to win five or more @entity75 since the game became open to both amateurs and professionals in 1968 , and is the first @entity9 of either gender to win the same @entity86 twice			1
@entity4 , just 22 , received the bigger ovation as she went up to collect the runner - up ’s shield from a crowd who had become agitated with the time her opponent was taking , especially between first and second serve			2
she will have learned an enormous amount from this and , after a meteoric rise in the past twelve months , has emerged as the surprise standard bearer for a coming generation			0
“ i had an incredible two weeks , i hope this is the start , ” she said			0
watching on : @entity100 tennis great @entity98 ( left ) oversees the action with alongside @entity103 mayor @entity102 backing : supporters of @entity4 in @entity105 at the final view from the top : @entity109 centre court in @entity103 on a glorious sunny day character : @entity0 made the final last year , but was overwhelmed by regular adversary @entity111 rising star : @entity4 also made the quarter - final of this year 's @entity114 huddle : photographers train their lenses on the players during the final seeking shade : @entity0 hides from the sun under her towel during a changeover in the second set fightback : @entity4 clawed her way back into the match , taking the second set on a tie break 7 - 6 @entity0 – whose boyfriend @entity129 was in @entity130 preparing for the @entity131 - won despite serving twelve double faults against the player who moves as well as anyone on the women ’s tour , and who only flagged right at the end of an attritional match			1
the @entity9 broke to take the first set , and then twice needed to break back at the end of the second to take it into the tiebreak			0
in that she led 5 - 3 before @entity4 reeled off four points to take into a decider			2
when @entity0 double faulted in the eighth game it seemed to be wobbling , but then she won the last eight points to romp home			0
she remains the supreme competitor in the game and the hardest player to close out , someone insistent on defying the up and comers			0
no hiding place : halep returning the ball to her opponent during the final set @entity36 : @entity0 wins her second @entity2 title after beating @entity5 's @entity4 roar : @entity0 emphatically celebrating her titanic three - set win			1

@entity0 beats @entity4 in three sets , 6 - 4 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 4
@entity166 was her second @entity2 title after winning it in 2012
it was 22 - year - old @entity4 's first ever @entity75 final
the @entity9 's fifth success in a @entity75 overall
