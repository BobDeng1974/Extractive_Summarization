@entity2 's ambassador to the @entity3 has described protest like this as being like the @entity30 riots but @entity2 's @entity3 ambassador @entity31 appeared to suggest that his government should not be criticised for the brutal crackdown – claiming that @entity34 had stressed the need for national security when dealing with the riots			1
@entity2 government forces have carried out a series of bloody massacres against civilians			0
but @entity42 refuses to accept responsibility , claiming they are conducted by terrorist groups			0

mr @entity31 's comments drew angry criticism from @entity9 's ambassador to the @entity3 , sir @entity91			2
he said : ' coming from a representative of a regime that is now responsible for the deaths of well over 15,000 citizens , the @entity2 ambassador 's comparison of his regime 's response with what happened in @entity18 last summer was utterly grotesque			1
' it just goes to show how untenable the position of the @entity2 regime has now become , and how desperate are the few remaining people willing to defend it			1
' @entity107 mp @entity106 , a member of the @entity109 foreign affairs committee , said : ' it is so crass			0
