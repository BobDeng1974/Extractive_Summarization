you might hope that every school would want pupils to work their very hardest – and pass any exams with flying colours			1
but one primary head has decided there is more to life than educational achievements , and has written to her final - year pupils to tell them not to worry about their results			1
headmistress @entity12 and her head of year six , @entity14 , told children that there are ‘ many ways of being smart ’ in the message , which was included with their @entity21 results			1
they asked the 11 - year - old pupils to remember that the scores ‘ will tell you something , but they will not tell you everything ’			2
the letter , which was sent by @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , has been widely circulated on @entity32			1
some users said it should be ‘ the first thing the new education secretary @entity35 should read ’			0
this is believed to be the first time the @entity50 letter has been used by a school in the @entity56			1
and the @entity56 version of the text includes a tell - tale @entity59 – a mention of a trip to a ‘ really neat place ’			0
the letter , which was addressed to individual pupils , said they had tried their ‘ very best during this tricky week ’ and the school was ‘ very proud ’ of them			1
it said test results ‘ do not always assess all of what it is that make each of you special and unique ’			2
the note then went on to list all the other talents the children possess , outside of exam results and academic achievements			0
headteacher : @entity12 said it was ' lovely ' to see so many positive comments about the letter praised : @entity29 ( pictured ) was last inspected in 2012 and awarded a ' good ' rating a spokeman for the 324 - pupil school , which was rated ‘ good ’ by @entity84 when it was last inspected in 2012 , wrote on @entity32 yesterday : ‘ wow			1
there are posts all over the world about this letter ! ‘ all we did was remind our @entity90 how amazing they are ! ’ but one @entity32 user posted : ‘ delicious irony that a template letter to kids celebrating uniqueness and individuality has been ripped off the internet , complete with americanisms			2
’ and @entity99 , a former headmaster and chairman of the @entity101 , last night attacked the school for using the letter as a ‘ political platform ’ to give an opinion about the quality of national curriculum tests			1
he said : ‘ they ’re undermining confidence that the children may have in the education system			0
‘ the message they ’re sending is that the examination results are in some way invalidated because there are other matters at stake			0
it ’s an indirect attack on the government			0
the message that the school is sending to the children is that somehow they are being betrayed by the system			2
‘ but they are not being betrayed by the system , it ’s actually the teachers who are letting the children down very badly			0
’ he added : ‘ if there ’s a fault with the tests , it ’s that they ’re too easy and they ’re undemanding			2
‘ that ’s why the government is toughening them up			0
but it ’s completely unacceptable to do this			0
‘ schools should not be a platform for promoting political ideologies – they should be neutral			0
most of the letter , reproduced above , was taken from a message sent to pupils at an unknown @entity50 school inspection : the school was last inspected by @entity84 in 2012 and awarded a ' good ' rating , but told that some teachers occasionally do not ' provide sufficient challenge for all ability groups during whole - class teaching '			1

letter sent to pupils at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31
year six students told ' these tests do not assess that you are unique '
but it turns out much of letter was copied from one sent in @entity50 last year
school was last inspected by @entity84 in 2012 when it was rated ' good '
