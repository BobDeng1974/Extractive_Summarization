@entity0 dramatically claimed yet another ‘ miracle ’ @entity2 victory as @entity4 ’s late drop goal sunk gallant sale , who were on course for a famous win inspired by @entity9			1
this was a tale of two halves and two fly - halves			1
the home side led this @entity16 , @entity18 tie at the @entity19 23 - 7 at half - time after a masterclass of attacking artistry from @entity9 , who played like a man deserving of an @entity25 squad place			1
yet , @entity5 had to play into a strong wind after the break and instead of their @entity29 having the last word , it went to his opposite number : @entity4			2
@entity33 barges over for a try in the first half as a rampant sale raced out to a 23 - 7 half - time lead in the @entity0 tradition established by @entity39 , @entity4 ’s sensational swerving shot in stoppage - time settled a mesmerising encounter , which suggests @entity2 ’s new era will contain all the thrills and spills of the old			1
the clock had reached 80 minutes when the @entity48 side — urged on by their ‘ @entity49 ’ in the stands — were in the midst of one last assault			0
their pack drove deep into @entity56 and worked a position for the drop goal			1
yet , to @entity4 ’s credit , he aborted the attempt under pressure from the @entity64 defence			2
but @entity0 kept the move alive and seconds later , their stand - off launched a kick into the wind and it arced round like a putt on a sloping green to fly through the posts			1
amid the @entity48 euphoria , @entity5 ’s shattered players lay in a series of dejected heaps			0
this was a cruel fate after so much heroic effort			0
@entity9 , who was superb for @entity5 in the opening 40 minutes , knocks over a penalty after getting his breath back , @entity4 said : ‘ it was pretty nervy			1
for the first attempt , @entity84 chased me down so i had to pass it on			0
but the lads got me in a great position again and thankfully it went over			0
as the 10 , it is your responsibility and you have to take that on your shoulders			0
thankfully i did all the practice and it paid off			0
’ in the opening period , despite @entity97 ’s early try , @entity0 were under the cosh as @entity5 ran amok on the back of @entity9 ’s astute prompting			1
his distribution and running were sublime , but he also defended resolutely and was immaculate with his goal - kicking — scoring 16 points and not missing any of his six shots			2
he endured one or two decision - making wobbles in the second half when his team were struggling , but overall this was a compelling @entity112 audition			2
all the indications last week were that @entity9 is destined to miss out on a place in the @entity25 squad to be announced on wednesday , but this performance may force a late re-think by @entity118 and his assistants			0
@entity0 centre @entity120 takes on the @entity5 defence as the @entity48 province began their fight - back with seconds of the game remaining , @entity4 sits back in the pocket and attempts a 40 - metre drop goal @entity131 ( left ) , @entity129 and @entity130 look on as @entity4 ( right ) fires over his drop goal ‘ @entity9 was outstanding for us , ’ said @entity5 ’s director of rugby , @entity134			1
‘ any contentious opinions about his goal - kicking were put to rest today and he put his tackles in too — 12 or 13 of them			2
‘ he is playing really well and if the @entity25 coaches select him , he wo n’t let them down			0
’ @entity140 touched down from close - range for the hosts in the 24th minute and five minutes later , @entity5 surged clear when @entity143 seized on @entity145 ’s deft pass and swept over in the left corner			2
@entity4 is mobbed by @entity147 after his last - ditch kick goes over as @entity9 ( left ) digests the defeat @entity134 ’s men were denied a possible penalty try when @entity152 was sin - binned for an off - the - ball tackle and after half - time , @entity154 ignored an overlap but was unable to score his second try			1
ultimately , that was decisive as @entity0 reverted to a power game and tries by @entity160 and @entity131 set up a grandstand finish			1
another @entity9 penalty was soon cancelled out by @entity4 , who then delivered the winning shot shortly after			0
‘ that was a brutal way to go down , ’ said @entity5 captain @entity164			0
now the @entity168 club must brace themselves for the daunting prospect of a trip to @entity171 , while @entity0 will await @entity172 on friday night , buoyed by their latest escape act .			0

sale led 23 - 7 at half - time as @entity140 and @entity33 *crossed* for tries
@entity180 **'s** men could only muster a @entity97 try in response
tries from @entity160 and @entity131 set up a *pulsating* finish
fly - half @entity4 **'s** 40 - metre drop goal completed @entity0 fight - back
