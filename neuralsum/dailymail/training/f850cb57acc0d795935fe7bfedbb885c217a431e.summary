by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 10:14 est , 30 september 2013 these images show the heart - stopping moment a man ran away from police and into the path of a tube train			2
the man was narrowly missed a second time by an @entity11 train as he went back across the tracks at @entity14 tube station			1
the dramatic scenes happened on saturday at 7.15pm after the unidentified man came down the concourse and spotted police officers on routine patrol			1
officers were on routine patrol at @entity21 in @entity22 when this man made eye contact with them before running away and into the path of two trains including this overground train he also ran in front of this eastbound district line train in his attempts to escape from police who say they were not there to arrest him and were just on routine patrol after making eye contact with them he immediately turned and ran , jumping across empty tracks and on to another platform			1
realising there was no way to escape , the man ran along along the platform before going back onto the tracks , crossing the path of a @entity44 train heading towards @entity45 before jumping into the path of an @entity11 train			2
the man came so close that the driver of the second train , who was travelling westbound , was forced to apply the emergency brake			1
the man also ran in front of another @entity57 train which was stationary at the time			0
as he has yet to be identified , police can not say if he is wanted in connection with any other crimes , and have no explanation for his behaviour			0
the man , who has n't been identified , ran in front of a third @entity57 train which was stopped at the time before escaping from the station this is the man police would like to speak to , but until they identify him they can not say if he was wanted in connection with another crime and can not explain his behaviour @entity72 have an office inside the station and often have officers on patrol there			1
investigators are now viewing @entity79 footage of the incident and speaking to witnesses to try and identify the young man			2
@entity83 , the investigating officer , said : ' trespass on the railway is , in itself , extremely dangerous and irresponsible , but to run in front of moving trains is putting your life on the line			0
' we do n’t believe the man was injured during the incident and thankfully , no one else was , but this was still extremely thoughtless behaviour			0
' if you recognise the man , or have any further information about the incident , i ’d urge you to come forward			0
' despite the emergency brake being used there were no delays because of the man 's actions			1
if you can help officers , please call @entity72 on 0800 40 50 40 or @entity110 , anonymously , on 0800 555 111			0
