by @entity0 asteroids in our solar system are thought to contain millions of pounds worth of minerals - and that 's just a fraction of what neighbouring planets may hold			1
the wealth of materials is so rich , in fact , billionaires including the likes of @entity14 ’s @entity13 and @entity16 director @entity15 are racing to be the first to harness these goods			0
and now a @entity20 artist has imagined the epic machines and structures needed by futuristic space miners to carry out these tasks , as we look to colonise and explore nearby planets			2
the concept images were created by @entity20 artist @entity27			1
he depicts how space miners on large crafts ( pictured ) could extract minerals from space			1
asteroids in our solar system contain millions of pounds worth of minerals and firms are looking to harness these materials in the near future @entity27 is a freelance artist , currently at @entity36 in @entity37			1
he specialises in concept artwork based on science , and science fiction			0
although @entity27 ’s images are concepts , space mining is an avenue being explored by firms and entrepreneurs			1
asteroid mining involves exploiting raw materials from near - @entity50 rocks			2
such asteroids are thought to contain a wealth of materials including gold , iron , nickel , titanium , hydrogen and oxygen			0
the company leading the charge when it comes to asteroid and space mining is @entity65 - set up in 2012 with backing from @entity14 ’s co-founders @entity13 and @entity67 , as well as avatar director @entity15			0
of the 9,000 known near - @entity50 asteroids , there are said to be more than 1,500 that are energetically as easy to reach as the moon			0
in one of his images , called @entity76 , mr @entity27 depicts a large chamber that resembles circular gas plants on @entity50			1
hot gases are seen flowing through the floating chambers , attached to large power units			0
in another , drills , similar to those used on industrial plants , are seen puncturing rocky terrains			0
a huge craft that looks as if it ’s been crafted from an asteroid is fitted with a large - turbine style wheel , which could be used to generate a form of energy to power the drills and research units			2
a futuristic office - style pyramid block is imagined in another image			0
although mr @entity27 ’s images are only concepts , space mining is an avenue being explored by firms and entrepreneurs			1
the first step is to mine asteroids orbiting in the solar system			1

experts believe these materials could be harvested as astronauts journey through space and visit other planets , or brought back to @entity50 and extracted for use in industrial plants either these materials could be harvested as astronauts journey through space , or brought back to @entity50 and extracted for use			1
entrepreneurs are hoping to extract these materials after experts claimed @entity50 supplies of elements including zinc , tin , silver , lead , gold and copper could run out within the next 60 years			0
based on @entity27 ’s vision of the future , transport vehicles could carry asteroids , or their materials , back to @entity50 or to other inhabited planets			1
they could also mine the materials mid-orbit			0
a huge craft that looks as if it ’s been crafted from an asteroid itself is shown in mr @entity27 's images , fitted with a large - turbine style wheel			2
this could be used to generate a form of energy to power the drills and other research units ( pictured ) a futuristic office - style pyramid block is imagined in another image ( pictured )			0

of the approximately 9,000 known near - @entity50 asteroids , the firm claim there are more than 1,500 that are ' energetically as easy to reach as the moon '			0
in may 2012 , a site called @entity197 , which ranks the profitability of asteroids , discovered that an asteroid in our solar system called 241 @entity203 contains $ 95.8 ( £ 60 ) trillion of mineral wealth inside it			2
this is almost the same as the annual gdp of the entire world .			0

concepts were created by artist @entity27 and depict how miners may extract minerals from asteroids and planets
images shows industrial drills , gas chambers , huge crafts fitted with turbines and futuristic power plants
asteroids in our solar system are thought to contain millions of pounds worth of raw minerals
@entity65 is among the firms looking to harness these materials for use on @entity50 in the near future
