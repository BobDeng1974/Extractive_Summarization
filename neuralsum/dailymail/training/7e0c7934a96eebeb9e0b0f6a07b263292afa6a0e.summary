scientists have succeeded in reading parts of an ancient scroll that was buried and blacked when @entity3 erupted almost 2,000 years ago			1
the scroll was one of hundreds that form the world 's oldest surviving library - and researchers say they are now hopeful it could reveal all of its secrets			1
it was retrieved from the remains of a lavish villa at @entity16 , which along with @entity17 was one of several @entity20 towns that were destroyed when @entity22			1

scientists have succeeded in reading parts of an ancient scroll that was buried in a volcanic eruption almost 2,000 years ago , holding out the promise that the world ¿ s oldest surviving library may one day reveal all of its secrets			1
some of the texts from what is called the @entity37 have been deciphered since they were discovered in the 1750s			0
but many more remain a mystery to science because they were so badly damaged that unrolling the papyrus they were written on would have destroyed them completely			1
' the papyri were completely covered in blazing - hot volcanic material , ' said @entity46 , a theoretical scientist at the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) in @entity50 who led the latest project			2
@entity46 and his colleagues decided to try a method called x-ray phase contrast tomography that had previously been used to examine fossils without damaging them			0
phase contrast tomography takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation — such as x-rays — passes through different substances , in this case papyrus and ink			2
using lab time at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , the researchers found they were able to decipher several letters , proving that the method could be used to read what 's hidden inside the scrolls			1
previous attempts to peer inside the scrolls failed to yield any readable texts because the ink used in ancient times was made from a mixture of charcoal and gum			2
this makes it indistinguishable from the burned papyrus			0

' our goal was to show that the technique is sensitive to the writing , ' said @entity46			0
in a further step , the scientists compared the handwriting to that of other texts , allowing them to conclude that it was likely the work of @entity113 , a poet and @entity115 philosopher who died about a century before the volcanic eruption			2
the next challenge will be to automate the laborious process of scanning the charred lumps of papyrus and deciphering the texts inside them , so that some 700 further scrolls stored in @entity50 can be read , @entity46 said			0
two words in a hidden layer of the fragment			0
in the top the sequence of @entity129 capital letters spells @entity131 ( pi - iota - pi - tau - omicron - iota - epsilon ) ; in the bottom the letter sequence of the next line , @entity134 ( epsilon - iota - pi - omicron - iota ) previous attempts to peer inside the scrolls failed to yield any readable texts because the ink used in ancient times was made from a mixture of charcoal and gum			1
scholars studying the @entity16 texts say the new technique , which was detailed in an article published in the journal @entity151 , may well mark a breakthrough for their efforts to unlock the ancient philosophical ideas hidden from view for almost two millennia			1
' it 's a philosophical library of @entity115 texts from a time when this philosophy influenced the most important classical latin authors , such as @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , ' said @entity165 , a professor of @entity129 and @entity166 at the @entity167 , @entity168 , who was not involved in the project			1
' there needs to be much work before one can virtually unroll carbonized papyrus because one will have to develop a digital method that will allow us to follow the layers , ' he said			0
' but in the 260 years of @entity178 it is certainly a remarkable year			0
