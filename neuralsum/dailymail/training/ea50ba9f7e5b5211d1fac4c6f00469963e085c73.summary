by @entity0 fake camera : @entity2 installed the replica on the @entity4 to encourage tourists to slow down villagers who built a fake speed camera in a desperate bid to slow traffic caused by the new @entity12 visitors centre have been threatened with legal action			1
@entity2 has been warned to remove the home - made replica camera from beside a narrow road through the @entity17 , @entity18 , within seven days or face court proceedings			1
mr @entity2 built the speed camera in a last - ditch effort to slow daytrippers attempting to dodge congestion on the main @entity4 road brought about by the @entity12 visitors centre , which has seen 500,000 tourists in six months			1
the £ 27m centre was opened in december 2013 around 1.5 miles from the site of @entity12 , a prehistoric monument which forms part of a @entity31			1
as part of the development the @entity33 , which ran directly past the site , was closed and dug up , forcing all visitor traffic onto the @entity4 , the main commuter route form the @entity38 to the @entity40 motorways			1
residents of @entity17 , which runs parallel to the @entity4 , reported a dramatic spike in the amount of drivers diverting through the village and ignoring its 30mph speed limit			1
mr @entity2 , a father of three , said the fake speed camera - made from an old @entity50 cabinet painted yellow - has been a success and he has been heaped with praise by residents			1
however @entity54 claims the dummy device has been put up illegally on land they own and it has to be taken down because it was not officially installed			1
mr @entity2 , 49 , a car mechanic , said : ' since the visitors centre has been open the @entity4 has become incredibly congested and that in turn has made the road through @entity17 into a rat run for drivers trying to dodge queues			1
' we have seen traffic levels through the village rise significantly to the point where people who live here are worried to walk down the road for fear of being hit by a speeding car			2
there have been numerous crashes in the last six months and several cats have been killed after being hit by cars			1
' one driver was clocked doing 63mph through the village			2
people fear for their safety			2
' the council says it has a robust approach to tackling speeding but they have n't done anything to stop it			2
' everyone who lives here is fed up of it so i decided to take matters into my own hands before someone got seriously hurt			2
' i built a dummy speed camera with my eight - year - old son @entity109 and we put it up on land owned by my next door neighbour			0
straight away it had an impact on the speed people drove through the village			0
the £ 27m @entity12 visitors centre has already attracted 500,000 tourists since it opened six months ago ' i have had villagers coming up to me to thank me for what i 've done because it 's had such an effect			1
' then i got a visit from someone from the council threatening me with legal action if i do n't take the camera down within seven days			0
they claim it is on their land but i have seen my next door neighbour 's deeds which show the land is his			0
' if the council want to take me to court over this one i 'm willing to fight them			0
i 'm just waiting for them to present something in writing			0
' i can not fathom why , if this simple safety measure is working , they are intent on taking it down yet they are n't doing anything about it themselves			0
' a spokesman for @entity54 said : ' the council has a robust system for dealing with speeding issues raised by local communities			0
' issues should be referred to the local community area board , who will work with the local community to examine what speed control measures are appropriate for that particular road			0
' the considerations to deal with speeding issues will include the use of the volunteer speedwatch scheme , installation of speed indicator devices or other direct measures			0
' it is vital that any scheme introduced is effective and delivers the required result			0
the council would ask everyone to follow the approved procedure to ensure the best scheme is delivered to meet the community needs			0
