by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 06:47 est , 13 march 2014 @entity2 threw up in the dock again on thursday after horrific images of his girlfriend 's body were shown in court			2
gasps were heard throughout the @entity10 courtroom when close - up pictures were briefly displayed , apparently by accident , on a computer screen by his defence team			0
they showed @entity17 's skull , body and her injuries after she was shot dead by the @entity20 at his home			0
@entity2 began violently retching at the sight of his girlfriend 's corpse before being handed a green bucket which he vomited into repeatedly			0
the image , showing the prosthetic limbs with white socks and stained with @entity17 's blood up to the knee , was displayed by lawyer @entity58 on a tv monitor at @entity2 's murder trial			1
the chief defence lawyer at @entity2 's murder trial today highlighted alleged missteps by police and questioned their treatment of key evidence during the investigation			2
lawyer @entity58 grilled a police forensics expert for a second day , challenging his analysis of a bullet - marked toilet door that was removed from @entity2 's bathroom after he shot @entity17			1
in an aggressive start to his cross-examination , mr @entity58 questioned whether colonel @entity74 even had the right qualifications to examine marks on the door that offer crucial evidence to what happened the moment the model was killed			1
he also forced col @entity74 to admit that police may have contaminated the crime scene during their investigation			2
accused : @entity2 claims he went to the bedroom to put on his prosthetics before smashing down the door centre of attention : the athlete is surrounded by security as he makes his way through @entity10 to the court mr @entity58 asked what happened to some fragments from the door that went missing after police investigators took possession of it			1
col @entity74 said he asked about the missing splinters , but repeatedly said he ' could n't remember ' which colleague he spoke to			0
the forensics analyst also conceded that footprints that appeared to be from police boots were seen in evidence photos , but later rubbed off			0
mr @entity58 argued they could have been made by @entity2 's prosthetic legs - which could have backed up a crucial argument by the sprinter that he was wearing them when he smashed down the door			1
col @entity74 earlier argued @entity2 would have been on his stumps both when he fired the shots that killed @entity33 and when he broke down the door			1
the lawyer also noted that @entity116 had not read @entity2 's version of events on the night of the killing until after he had completed his forensic study of the door and was therefore leaning toward the prosecution 's version of what happened			2
key evidence : forensic analyst colonel @entity74 stands in front of the toilet door through which @entity2 shot @entity17 while holding the cricket bat the athlete then used to break it down key moment : the re-enactment is critical to the case as it tests the athlete 's assertions about exactly what happened on the night he killed @entity33 in his bathroom on @entity34 last year @entity2 has said he shot @entity33 by mistake through the door , fearing there was a dangerous intruder in the house			1
the prosecution says he intentionally killed her after an argument			0
yesterday , col @entity74 argued that @entity2 was on his stumps at the time he broke down the door with the cricket bat , contradicting the paralympian 's assertion that he was wearing his prosthetic legs			1
the issue is critical to the case as it tests the athlete 's assertions about exactly what happened on the night he killed @entity33 in his bathroom on @entity34 last year			0
@entity2 says he fearfully approached the bathroom on his stumps and shot @entity33 by mistake while believing she was an intruder			0
according to his account , he then put on his prostheses and tried to kick down the locked toilet door before hitting it with the bat after realising what he had done			1
however , col @entity74 said the bat was used to hit the door from a low position and knelt and swung @entity2 's cricket bat to demonstrate his point			1
reconstruction : colonel @entity74 of the @entity170 stands in court in front of the toilet door through which @entity2 shot @entity17 evidence : colonel @entity74 kneels down to show that @entity2 was not wearing his prostheses at the time analysis : the height at which the bat struck the door is measured in court in an attempt by the prosecution to determine whether @entity2 was on his prosthetic legs at the time demonstration : the forensic expert shows the point where the bat struck the door , causing it to splinter he also believed @entity2 was on his stumps when he fired through the toilet door , based on the angle of the bullet marks in the door , which was on display in the courtroom alongside a recreation of the cubicle			1
he told the court : ' the marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and i suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots			0
' and in a dramatic climbdown , lead prosecutor @entity206 also said that it was no longer part of the state 's case that @entity2 was wearing his prosthetics at the time			0
that mistaken claim by prosecutors in the early part of the investigation was used by them to argue there was premeditation in the killing			0
they asserted that by taking the time to put on his legs before going to the bathroom , @entity2 showed premeditation before killing the 29 - year - old model			1
evidence : the bullet holes and shattered wood where @entity2 struck the door are clearly seen here clues : based on the angle and height of the four bullet holes seen here , @entity2 fired his gun on his stumps , according to forensic analyst colonel @entity74 measurements : the court is shown a picture which @entity116 took at the time of his initial investigation a few weeks after @entity33 was shot on @entity34 last year detail : this image shows where the bat broke through the door in the weakest part of the panel former @entity248 cricketer @entity247 , right , has claimed the bat @entity2 used to smash down the toilet door after shooting @entity17 had been signed by him			1
police colonel @entity74 presented the bat as a key piece of evidence about exactly what happened on the night miss @entity17 died			0
shortly after the bat was shown on tv , @entity247 - @ hershybru on @entity254 - posted : ' just saw my signature on the bat used by the accused in oscar trial ... lol # neveradullmoment ' the prosecution now says @entity2 first hit the door with a bat in an effort to get to @entity33 , then shot through the door			1
but in another crucial endorsement of the defence 's case , col @entity74 testified that the athlete broke down the door only after he fired his weapon			2
' i would say the door was hit after the shots , ' he told the court			0
col @entity74 earlier demonstrated that height measurements showed that @entity2 was not wearing his prostheses at the time			2
' it 's quite low down on the door , ' he testified about one of the marks he said were made by the bat			0
he said it was ' not the normal position that i would expect from a mark from a cricket bat '			0
he said marks on the door were consistent with @entity2 ' being in a natural position without his prostheses '			2
defence lawyer @entity58 countered that @entity2 hit the door with a ' bent back ' and that the low marks were consistent with such a body position			1
mr @entity74 also said a steel plate in the main bathroom in @entity2 's home had been damaged by being hit with a ' hard ' object , or after the object fell against it			1
overcome : @entity2 shows the strain as he listens to events surrounding the moment he shot his girlfriend tough to hear : the athlete - known as @entity2 - reacts in the dock while listening to the forensic evidence emotional : @entity2 reacts while listening to evidence about the moment he shot his girlfriend stress : the 27 - year - old runner rubs his eyes while taking notes in the dock during the trial deliberation : the @entity315 athlete confers with a member of his legal team at the @entity318 doubt cast : according to the athlete 's account , he put on his prosthetic legs in an effort to kick down the door before using the cricket bat the steel plate was new evidence			1
a photo of the damaged plate was shown			0
prosecutors say @entity2 intentionally shot 29 - year - old @entity17 after a fight			0
those prosecutors used mr @entity74 to show what they say are more inconsistencies in @entity2 's version of events by erecting the door in court and , behind it , an exact replica of the cubicle in his house			1
there was also a replica toilet			0
the bullet - marked door also had what appeared to be white tags to indicate the bullet holes			1
concern : the athlete 's uncle @entity350 ( far left ) , aunt @entity352 ( second left ) and sister @entity353 ( centre ) watch the re-enactment from the public gallery there for him : the paralympian 's sister @entity353 has been in court every day of the trial so far @entity2 shot at @entity362 four times through the door , hitting her in the hip , arm and head			2
one shot missed , the court has heard			0
led by questions from prosecutor @entity206 , mr @entity74 removed his blazer and walked down from the witness stand and over to the door to demonstrate to the judge how he believes the door was hit in the pre-dawn hours of @entity34 last year			1
he said he was particularly interested in two specific marks on the door that he concluded were made by the bat			0
with the use of court photos and by kneeling down in court , mr @entity74 showed the low position that the person could have been in when striking the door with the bat			2
doubt : pathologist @entity387 said the partially digested vegetables he found in the model 's stomach suggested miss @entity17 ( pictured ) had food less than two hours before her death at around 3am scene : @entity2 shot @entity33 through the bathroom door at his home ( above ) in @entity10 in the early hours of @entity34 last year			2

@entity397 , who analysed bullet - hit toilet door , grilled by @entity58
mr @entity58 accused @entity74 of not having correct qualifications to examine marks
door fragments *disappeared* after police took it from scene according to mr @entity58
@entity74 says @entity2 was ' on his stumps ' when he broke door
