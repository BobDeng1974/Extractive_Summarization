by @entity0 published : 18:31 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 06:02 est , 30 june 2012 an automatic block to protect children from internet porn has been ruled out by ministers , according to a leaked email			1
it says that internet firms have been privately assured they will not have to bring in stringent filtering systems			1
the revelation makes a farce of a consultation paper that was launched earlier this week asking for views on dealing with adult material			1
campaign : the @entity15 is calling for a robust automatic block to filter out porn by default the email says ministers ‘ wholeheartedly support active choice ’ in which parents would have to say yes or no to adult material when setting up an internet connection			1
the @entity15 is calling for a similar , but more robust , automatic block or ‘ active choice plus ’ system			2
@entity27 would be filtered out by default with users having to opt in to see it			0
the campaign has been backed by deputy children ’s commissioner @entity32 and @entity33 , the mother of murdered schoolgirl @entity34			0
support : @entity36 last month said there was a clear case for looking at default blocks on explicit sites			0
the @entity15 's campaign has been backed by @entity33 , right , the mother of murdered schoolgirl @entity34 last month @entity36 conceded there was a clear case for looking at default blocks			0
but this has been ruled out according to the email sent on thursday by @entity46 of the @entity47 to 200 members including @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
‘ i spoke to the @entity55 this morning about the consultation and they made it clear that @entity59 ( the @entity59 ) , ministers and the relevant departments wholeheartedly support active choice and not default filtering or the so - called active choice plus solution , ’ he wrote			1
‘ the only reason they are consulting on this is because @entity67 told the @entity15 that they would consult and listen to all views			0
proposals : the government launched a consultation paper an on ' opt - in ' system , under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available ‘ this is in line with what we ’ve been told throughout – that government supports active choice			1
’ @entity84 , who sits on the board of @entity59 , said : ‘ i am astounded by the contents of this leaked email			1
it reflects a degree of cynicism which does not fit with my expectations of this government in this area			0
‘ potentially , it means this whole consultation is a sham with the outcome already pre-determined			1
’ @entity98 , who is @entity99 ’s media spokesman , said : ‘ this email is explosive			1
it is very important we have a proper consultation which gives parents and children ’s organisations the chance to say why they want to put children first			1
it is time ministers stood up for ordinary people rather than big business			0
’ the consultation , which was launched by children ’s minister @entity114 last week , includes an option for ‘ active choice plus ’ , which is favoured by child safety campaigners and many mps			1
this option is being resisted by internet companies , which make millions from adverts for pornographic websites			2
in his email , mr @entity46 , who is public affairs manager at the @entity47 , described the ten - week consultation exercise as ‘ essentially a questionnaire ’			1
last night he said : ‘ this was a private email sent to our members			2
' it was my take on where we are , which is that the @entity92 and @entity59 support active choice			1
‘ the point of the consultation is to get more evidence and views			2
' i do n’t think this is a foregone conclusion			0
i was stating the current position			0
‘ this issue is out to consultation and our members will be making their views known			2
we do support active choice as the most sensible solution			0
’ but mr @entity84 , who is also secretary of the @entity144 @entity145 on internet safety , said : ‘ there is growing evidence of the damage being done to children by unrestricted access to hardcore porn			1
' we have never said there should be no porn on the internet			1
but if you want to have access to it , you should have to prove you are old enough to access it			0
’ @entity161 mp @entity160 said : ‘ this is exactly what i would expect from @entity47 who have been constantly resistant to the idea of changing anything			0
‘ this issue matters to millions of parents and ordinary people across the country			0
' this is even more reason why they should make their views heard in the consultation			2
’ a @entity55 spokesman said : ‘ it is simply not true that ministers have already made up their minds , regardless of what one official may have said			0
' the reported comments do not in any way reflect government policy			0
we are seeking views and evidence from everybody			0
’ officials yesterday shut down the consultation exercise website following a security blunder			2
site visitors were able to see other people ’s confidential responses and personal details – including passwords and email addresses .			2

leaked email says internet firms have been assured they will not face stringent filtering systems
comes after @entity92 launched consultation on dealing with online porn
