take back the @entity0 aims to end sexual harassment on the @entity3 underground dressed in pink sparkly wigs and making a lot of noise , the attention - grabbing group of women boarding the @entity0 could almost have been mistaken for a boisterous hen party			1
however these ladies had a much more serious agenda when they took to the public transport system in @entity3 's capital			2
dozens of members of the feminist group @entity17 stormed the capital 's subway system in a ' @entity0 ' demonstration against violence against women and sexual aggression on the public transport			1
their aim is to raise awareness of the increasing levels of intimidation against women on the @entity0 and to ask the @entity31 , the @entity3 public transportation operator , to act to reduce it			2
speaking to @entity33 a spokesperson for @entity35 ( which translates as @entity36 ) explained : ' when you are a woman on the subway in @entity39 , you are often the victim of different types of sexual aggression			2
' we have done a study in the @entity0 this summer in @entity39 , and the study showed that three out of four women were adapting their behaviour or their clothes and their way of dressing when they were going to take the @entity0			0
' the group pasted hundreds of posters around the @entity0 during the demonstration , which aim to bring attention to the issue and ' expose the insecurity women feel on public transport			1
' ' spreading your legs is not necessary , ' one sign reads			0
' it is preferable to keep your legs together			0
testicles are not made of crystal and will not @entity63 can thus leave more space for your neighbours			0
you will no longer inflict this visual pollution on them			0
' signs posted by the group @entity17 on the @entity0 include ones that urge ' in case of sexual harassing or sexual touches : shout , ask for help , strike ' ' spreading your legs is not necessary , ' one sign reads			1
' it is preferable to keep your legs together ' other signs say : ' in case of sexual harassing or sexual touches : shout , ask for help , strike , ' and ' when the train is crowded , do not take advantage of it to rub yourself against your neighbour			1
' unsurprisingly the posters have prompted a strong response on social media , with thousands tweeting with the hash tag # @entity91 and sharing images of the signs dotted all over public transport			1
' # @entity91 encourages women to reclaim public transport ' one user tweets ' i have never regretted leaving @entity39 but that was before # @entity91 which i would love to be a park of , ' one user tweets			2
' a campaign that could be replicated everywhere , re : sexual harassment on public transport			1
# @entity91 , ' another posts			0
take back the @entity0 is based on the hugely successful @entity106 organisation @entity107 , which fights against violence in all forms			0
the organisation , which has spread across @entity110 since it 's origin in the 1970s , organises marches and sit - ins aimed at ending sexual and domestic violence .			0
