by @entity1 reporter published : 09:45 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 19:48 est , 10 march 2014 a farmer ’s daughter who claims she had to stay at home and tend the cows while her teenage siblings went dancing is suing her elderly parents for a share of their £ 7million estate			2
@entity11 , 45 , insists she was repeatedly assured by her mother and father that she would take over the family ’s thriving farm and its herd of pedigree @entity18 cows			1
she says she is owed a substantial stake in 200 - acre @entity21 for her years of toil			0
but @entity23 and @entity24 , now in their 70s , are fighting her claim at the @entity28			1
family at war : @entity11 , 45 , left , says she is entitled to a stake the dairy business in @entity33 , @entity34 , owned by her parents @entity23 and @entity24 , right , after spending more than 25 years working long hours for them miss @entity11 told an earlier court hearing that she missed out on going to @entity39 dances with her two sisters as a teenager because she had to stay at home in @entity43 , @entity34 , and complete her farming chores			1
her parents said her patience would one day be rewarded , she claimed			0
‘ they always told me that the farm would be left to me , ’ she told judge @entity47			0
‘ even on my birthday … they would say , “ you will have the damn lot one day , it will all be yours ”			0
’ the judge found miss @entity11 had ‘ established an entitlement to a beneficial interest in the farm or farming business ’ but her parents are challenging the ruling			1
@entity60 , representing mr @entity61 , 75 , and his 76 - year - old wife , argued their daughter had earned a fair income working on the farm and was provided with ‘ bed and board ’			1
the couple put miss @entity11 through agricultural college , he said , adding : ‘ she said in terms that agriculture was her love and she wanted to be on the farm			1
’ ' not fair ' : miss @entity11 says she worked ' extremely long hours ' tending cows while her sisters went to @entity79 dances the court heard that even when miss @entity11 worked elsewhere she failed to boost her earnings mr @entity82 pointed out that she only earned £ 5,000 as a consultant for @entity84 in 2006			1
‘ so when the opportunity is there to do something else , she does worse , ’ the barrister told the court			0
he said there was no evidence she would have been better off had she not worked on the farm and insisted she had suffered no ‘ substantial detriment ’ by relying on anything her parents had said or done			0
but @entity95 , for @entity61 , said promises were made by the couple from 1985 , when their daughter was 17			0
the court heard she worked ‘ extremely long hours ’ with the cows , sometimes unpaid			0
if she complained to her parents about meagre wages , she was told the farm would ultimately belong to her – and ‘ not to kill the goose that laid the golden egg ’ , mr @entity101 added			1
' golden egg ' : miss @entity11 argues that her parents told her ' you 'll have the whole damn lot one day ' although the earlier hearing found miss @entity11 had ‘ walked away from the farm ’ for periods between 1989 and 2008 , she moved back home following a reconciliation with her parents			1
mr @entity61 made a ‘ representation ’ that she could live rent - free for life in a farmhouse on the estate , mr @entity101 said , and in 2009 , a pledge that she would inherit the farm was made in a draft will			2
but after a final family ‘ rupture ’ in late 2012 , her parents gave her notice to leave the farmhouse			2
possession proceedings followed , but miss @entity11 insisted she was entitled to a stake			2
mr @entity101 added : ‘ it is plain from the evidence that a talented , hard - working and capable lady has spent a substantial part of her adult life – over a period of 25 years – carrying out difficult physical work for the benefit of her parents … on the strength of their repeated representations that she would eventually take over the farm and business			0
’ @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 will give their decision at a later date .			0

@entity23 , 75 , and @entity24 , 76 , always promised her farm , she claims
@entity11 , 45 , says if she complained about her meagre wages , her parents would say : ' do *n't* kill the goose that laid the golden egg '
miss @entity11 was kicked off farm in @entity34 , @entity154 , after family *row* in 2012
she won her case against them but now her parents are appealing ruling
a decision by the @entity28 on the @entity61 case is expected soon
