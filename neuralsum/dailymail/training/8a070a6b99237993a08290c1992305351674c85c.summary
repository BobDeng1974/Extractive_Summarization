bishop @entity278 *smashed* into custom bicycle maker @entity3 , 41 , last saturday in @entity32 causing his death
she left the scene and returned 20 minutes later but only after she was *confronted* by a *bystander*
@entity15 records show @entity7 was arrested in 2010 after reportedly blowing three times the legal limit
she was so drunk she had thrown up on herself and the cop who stopped her could n't complete the field sobriety test
police refuse to say whether @entity7 was breathalyzed after saturday 's accident
@entity72 , whose @entity297 page *proudly* displays his custom bikes , was rushed to a *nearby* *hospital* before *succumbing* to his injuries
