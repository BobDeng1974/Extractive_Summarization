@entity0 booted 15 points as @entity2 claimed a 20 - 10 @entity4 victory over @entity5 at a wet and windy @entity6			1
@entity0 overcame a difficult start , when he gifted the visitors a try in the opening minute , to find the target with five penalties while @entity13 crossed the whitewash for the @entity2			2
@entity15 scored @entity5 's try , which was converted by @entity17 , but they struggled in the miserable conditions thereafter			1
@entity0 ( above ) kicked five penalties for @entity2 as they recorded a comfortable win against @entity5 @entity0 offloads the pass before @entity5 try - scorer @entity15 makes the tackle @entity23 ( right ) and @entity24 ( left ) of @entity2 challenge @entity5 's @entity25 @entity0 contributed to a dream @entity5 start when skipper @entity27 charged down his attempted clearance kick after just 38 seconds and prop @entity15 followed up to score , with @entity17 ' conversion making it 7 - 0			1
there was a long delay early on when @entity33 took a heavy blow to the head and fortunately he was able to walk off and was replaced by @entity36			0
@entity0 clipped the post with a 45 - metre penalty in the eighth minute but did find his range almost immediately afterwards when @entity5 went off their feet again			0
and when the visitors dropped the scrum in the 16th minute , he slotted in between the sticks again			0
@entity45 's darting run drew yet another penalty for offside and @entity0 edged the @entity2 ahead 9 - 7 at half - time but @entity5 must have fancied their chances with the wind and rain at their backs in the second half			0
@entity0 prepares to kick a penalty as @entity2 beat @entity5 in the @entity4 @entity2 's @entity45 ( centre ) kicks the ball during the match with @entity5 on friday @entity58 ( bottom ) of @entity2 hauls @entity5 's @entity60 down but it was @entity0 again kicking over a 42nd - minute penalty from 35 metres into that wind and rain to make it 12 - 7 after @entity5 conceded yet another penalty at the breakdown			1
and @entity2 then took a real grip on the game when @entity24 cut through , @entity70 rumbled on and then @entity0 and @entity71 set up @entity72 for a try in the 45th minute @entity17 was short with a 50 - metre shot but gave @entity5 a boost with a 56th - minute penalty for offside to make it 17 - 10			1
but when former @entity2 skipper @entity78 was sin - binned for an off the ball tackle , @entity0 kicked his fifth penalty in the 63rd minute			2
@entity17 hit the post with a penalty shortly afterwards and then @entity5 declined two kickable penalties in there last six minutes to go for the corner			0
it proved the wrong option in the face of some determined @entity2 resistance .			0

@entity15 scored a @entity5 try after just one minute
before @entity17 made it 7 - 0 from the conversion at @entity6
but @entity0 kicked @entity2 to victory with five penalties
and @entity13 scored the @entity2 only try of the match
