@entity0 believes football will be the loser when his @entity4 team face @entity5 behind closed doors here on tuesday night			1
the @entity8 group game at the @entity9 will be played in a surreal atmosphere after @entity11 punished the home team for the behaviour of their fans in recent games			1
but @entity4 boss @entity0 believes nobody wins from the decision			1
@entity18 ( left ) , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity22 train in @entity23 @entity4 stars were preparing for their @entity8 clash at @entity5 on tuesday city stars were feeling the chill as many trained in snoods and winter garments ahead of the game he said : ' i had this experience many years ago			1
i ca n’t remember when			0
' it will be very strange with everybody being able to hear the players ’ voices during the game			2
' but we have no option and we must play that way			2
' many may think the local team will suffer the most damage , but i think the biggest loser is the game of football			1
' it ’s a pity that we ca n’t play with fans			2
this show is for fans and it will be a strange game			2
' while @entity0 has experienced the surreal atmosphere of an empty stadium before , it will be a new experience for @entity55			1
fresh from scoring four against @entity56 , @entity57 ( centre ) also trained with @entity4 team - mates @entity22 was among the few @entity4 stars who trained in shorts and with little winter wear summer signing @entity64 ( third right ) was nearly covered in head - to - toe during the session , however city stars looked focused in training as they chase their first @entity8 win of the season he said : ' it will be strange			1
i have never had the experience before			0
we just have to take care of ourselves			0
i hope we can play a great game and get an important three points			1
' city have yet to win in @entity82 , losing to @entity83 in @entity84 on matchday one and then drawing at home to @entity87			1
but the full back sees now reason to change their attacking approach against in - form @entity5 , who sit second in the @entity94 league and beat @entity95 6 - 0 at the weekend			1
@entity55 added : ' we have great defenders			0
normally we like to attack and sometimes we can concede space at the back			0
@entity0 's @entity4 team will be hoping for their first win of the @entity8 campaign the @entity4 squad prepare for their flight to the @entity94 capital to take on @entity5 the match will be played at an empty @entity107 after @entity5 fans were banned for racist chanting ' it would be easy to put 10 players in our own half but we are n't that kind of team			1
we press high and leave space between the lines , that 's the way we like to play and we wo n't change			2
' @entity0 launched a stern defence of @entity120 , who has come in for criticism for his inconsistent performances this season			2
the @entity124 said : ' if you compare his performances to last year 's brilliant form maybe he just needs time			0
city have yet to pick up their first win in @entity82 , having lost to @entity83 and drawn with @entity87 @entity22 posted this picture of the snow in @entity23 - temperatures are expected to be below zero @entity57 scored all four goals in @entity4 's 4 - 1 win over @entity56 at the @entity135 on saturday ' he will continue to be a very important player for our team , if you look at his goal against @entity140 you can see his quality			1
he had a busy summer but he 's getting better and is getting near to his normal form			0
' @entity0 also suggested that @entity120 could be deployed as a no 10 in the future			2
he said : ' it can be an option because he has the quality to play behind the striker			2
in the national team [ @entity149 ] he plays forward			0
' in our team he 's a very important midfielder and he will continue to play in that role			0
when he has had problems it 's because the team has had problems			0
@entity55 said @entity4 will not change their approach and will take the match to @entity5 on tuesday @entity0 defended his midfielder @entity120 after some inconsistent performances this season ' when he plays well in his midfield position he is the best at that role in the @entity164			1
' their slow start to the group stage underlined just how far @entity4 have to go to succeed on the @entity169 stage , but @entity55 believes sheer hard graft is the key			1
' it takes time , ' the @entity172 said			0
' we are a team that 's improved in the last few years but this competition demands so much , playing the best teams in @entity11			2
' we are improving and have great players but this is so difficult			0
we would like to win this but we have to work really hard to do it			0
' we just need to work hard and win games and learn from mistakes in previous years			0
' @entity4 's players huddle for warmth under blankets during @entity4 's 2 - 1 win against @entity5 last season @entity57 scored twice at the @entity9 to give @entity4 a crucial victory the two teams met at this point in the @entity8 last season , with two @entity57 goals earning @entity4 a vital 2 - 1 victory			1
but a bone of contention was the state of the pitch at the @entity9 , which had been unable to cope with heavy rainfall and was badly cut up			0
@entity0 said it was ' unbelievable ' that the match had been able to go ahead on such a poor surface			1
although the match is expected to be played in sub-zero temperatures , with the first snowfall of the @entity94 winter seen over the weekend , @entity0 has no complaints about the surface			1
he said : ' last year we were concerned			0
it was impossible and we knew that before the game			0
this year , no. it 's not the best as its difficult here in winter but its normal and we have no problems			0
