the @entity0 married @entity1 last year after five failed marriages when the @entity0 , one of @entity6 ’s wealthiest aristocrats , divorced his fifth wife , his friends worried that he would never be truly happy again			1
and they were understandably concerned to learn that , despite the deep acrimony of the split and a vast £ 17 million settlement , the 68 - year - old @entity8 was now contemplating going down the aisle for an astonishing sixth time – to marry a glamorous blonde psychotherapist and yoga teacher who is 18 years his junior			1
now , one year on from their wedding at @entity20 , @entity1 has decided to speak about her dramatic change of fortune , which has taken her from life as a state - school educated career woman with a flat just off @entity28 ’s @entity27 to a new world as a @entity30 and chatelaine of not one but two stately homes , including the magnificent 84 - room @entity33 , a @entity34 mansion in @entity35			1
and , while she wo n’t discuss the details of any professional help she may have given her new husband , who is known as @entity42 , it is clear , say his friends , that he is happier than he has been for years			1
‘ when i look through my bedroom window and i ’m in a castle and see the gorgeous view , moat and 17th century windmill , i have to pinch myself			2
it feels like a dream , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ but meeting and marrying @entity42 was completely natural			2
finding love like that was all about timing – it came right for both of us			2
‘ i still see all my old friends and they assure me i have n’t let my marriage into the aristocracy go to my head			2
i have n’t changed and i do n’t intend to			0
’ the collapse of the @entity0 ’s fifth marriage to @entity63 , his wife of 23 years , had been all the more distressing because it emerged that she had been conducting an affair with one of his closest friends , pharmaceutical tycoon dr @entity67			1
like his new wife , @entity68 had come from humble origins , the daughter of a toolmaker from @entity73 , @entity74			1
the @entity0 had often described her as the love of his life but last year he divorced her on grounds of adultery			1
the @entity30 , who speaks with a soft @entity93 burr , is originally from @entity94 , where a youthful passion for surfing and international travel led her into a career as an air stewardess with @entity100			0
while at @entity100 , she took degrees in psychotherapy and trained as a yoga teacher , rising to become manager and clinical supervisor of the airline ’s in - house counselling service @entity108			1
she later went on to work at the celebrity rehab clinic @entity110 , where she specialised in eating disorders and sex addiction			0
she also studied at the famous @entity114 clinic in @entity115 – whose clients have included celebrities such as @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 – and now works at @entity121 in @entity122			0
‘ i specialise in relationship difficulties , depression and anxiety			0
i like to be able to help others – but most people seem to like referring to me being a sex therapist ! ’ she smiles			0
‘ it does feel weird to have such a grand title but i do n’t go around wearing a tiara , ’ she laughs , speaking at a cocktail party she hosted in aid of @entity132 charity at a @entity28 private members ’ club			0
‘ being a @entity30 is still very new – we recently celebrated our first wedding anniversary			0
it ’s something to adjust to			0
@entity42 has such presence , especially with the locals in the countryside in @entity35			0
i ’m adapting to the role			0
’ @entity42 , whose real name is @entity147 , is sometimes known as the ‘ @entity148 ’ because of his fascination with @entity150 and ancient mysticism			0
wives numbers one and two : the @entity0 was married to @entity153 , the daughter of the late @entity155 ambassador baron @entity154 from 1967 - 1973 ( left )			1
the year after his first divorce , he wed @entity158 ( right ) in 1977 , @entity159 became his third wife but the pair divorced in 1983			1
she is reported to have received a settlement and a trust fund for their daughter in the proceedings the new couple now divide their time between @entity170 i listed @entity33 and their other stately pile , @entity174 in @entity175 , which is currently home to his 41 - year - old son and heir @entity176 , @entity179 , and his villa on the island of @entity182			1
they also spend a good deal of time in @entity185			0
@entity1 will shortly celebrate her 50th birthday on a trip to @entity115 with her husband , who has a fortune estimated at £ 120 million			1
‘ when we were first married , all that people seemed to concentrate on was his marriage scandal and saying i was a sex therapist , but there ’s a lot more to my practice than that , ’ she says			1
‘ although i ’ve scaled down my psychotherapy work because i need to travel with @entity42 , i ’m determined to continue in practice because i value my independence , ’ she explains			0
she does admit , however , that she does n’t use her grand title in her professional life			0
‘ i do n’t particularly want everybody to know who i married because i was concerned it might affect my relationship with them , ’ she explains			1
she has also become stepmother to the @entity0 ’s four children ( by wives one , three and four ) and five grandchildren and latest in a succession of @entity214			1
lord @entity216 ’s first marriage in 1967 was to @entity153 , daughter of the late @entity155 ambassador baron @entity154			0
the couple had two children but divorced in 1973			0
it is said that @entity153 received a six - figure settlement , but that she was so financially unaware , she lodged it in her current account			1
@entity227 ( @entity226 ) @entity225 , the ex-wife of @entity228 ( left ) became the @entity8 's fourth wife in 1985			1
the pair were married for three years before he met @entity68 ( right ) who he was to be married to the longest she died in 2010			1
in 1974 , @entity42 married @entity158 , the secretary of kids , a charity for deprived children , which he had set up			1
they divorced three years later in 1977			2
the woman who was to become his third wife – @entity159 – was named in the divorce petition , and he married her the same year			1
in 1983 , however , lord @entity216 was back in the divorce courts			0
‘ he gave me a settlement and a trust fund for our daughter , ’ @entity159 revealed at the time			0
then came @entity225 , the ex-wife of @entity228 , whom he married in 1985			2
the couple had split once even before they wed and finally divorced in 1988			0
lawyers said she could have claimed millions but it was reported at the time that she had accepted a settlement of about £ 300,000			0
it was , however , the @entity0 ’s acrimonious fifth marriage – and divorce – that attracted the greatest scandal			1
‘ she is the centre of my life			0
i call her “ stregissima ” – great white witch , ’ he said delightedly when he married @entity68 in december 1990 at a @entity262 register office			2
he was @entity63 ’s third husband			2
the couple 's lengthy marriage ended after the @entity0 discovered her affair with a family friend the marriage was by some distance his most successful			1
but in 2006 , they met @entity276 - born dr @entity67 at a @entity150 convention in @entity278			2
dr @entity67 calls himself a ‘ transhumanist ’ and has a deep - seated interest in immortality and anti-ageing therapies			2
he has his own fortune estimated at £ 180 million			0
the divorced scientist and entrepreneur became a firm family friend , paying for both the @entity0 and @entity63 to undergo a £ 220,000 human genome mapping process – which can reveal genetic diseases – at a @entity185 clinic			1
@entity67 also lavished gifts on @entity63 , including a @entity292 necklace with matching earrings			0
and by 2009 she had begun working for him , telling her husband that she had been made president of one of his biopharmaceutical companies , a role that meant she made frequent trips to @entity185			2
though the @entity0 had become suspicious of how close @entity67 was becoming to his wife , it was not until he was handed tapes of conversations between @entity63 and her 87 - year - old father , which confirmed the affair – and became the subject of a potentially costly legal wrangle – that he had evidence which led him to file divorce proceedings in 2010			1
the tapes had been made by @entity312 , a 62 - year - old former beautician who has lived with @entity63 ’s father @entity313 for the past few decades , since his divorce from her mother @entity315			1
@entity312 is said to have had a troubled relationship with @entity63			0
it prompted the @entity0 to throw her out of @entity33 and sparked a bitter court battle which lasted more than two years			1
@entity63 ’s divorce settlement is believed to have cost him in the region of £ 17 million			0
this includes a £ 4 million apartment in @entity324 as well as cash and possessions worth about £ 13 million			0
despite his five divorces , lord @entity216 still has a sizeable £ 120 million fortune – including the stately homes and a hoard of @entity333 treasure worth £ 100 million , but so contentious it can not be sold			0
@entity63 has had further difficulties since then			0
last june she was served with an eviction notice by dr @entity67 demanding she leave his spectacular £ 8 million mansion in @entity338 , @entity91 , where she had been living since her divorce			0
he , meanwhile , had engaged on an affair of his own – later marrying his new mistress , 50 - year - old @entity341 from the @entity342			1
@entity1 , however , is undeterred by all the fuss			1
‘ it took me a long time to find the right man – i had a few long - term boyfriends before , but no children , ’ she explains			2
she may be a @entity30 , but she remains as practical and down - to - earth as ever			2
‘ i ’m still the same old me – @entity1 , without an @entity352 , ’ she says			1
@entity216 was interviewed at the @entity353 which is particularly campaigning to save orang - utans in @entity356 and to stop illegal birdhunting in @entity358			2
