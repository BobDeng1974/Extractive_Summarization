i ’m currently planning the next move for @entity2 after he got his revenge over @entity4			1
we all expected fireworks and unfortunately the main event just did n’t live up to it			2
but @entity2 did what he had to do and now has a great future in front of him – i ’m in talks with both @entity13 and @entity14 about cruiserweight world - title fights with @entity2			1
the rest of the division know that he sells			0
the numbers from the weekend were very good and that makes him commercially attractive to all of them			0
the next move for @entity2 is being planned after he did what he had to do to beat @entity4 cruiserweight world title fights against @entity13 or @entity14 could be on the cards for @entity2 ( right ) at the moment , it looks like his next fight will be for a world title in the spring			1
we are already in discussions with @entity13 , the @entity30 champion from @entity31 , and i can reveal we are also talking to @entity14 , the @entity33 who has the @entity35 belt			0
we have seen the city of @entity37 get behind @entity2 and i am in talks about putting on a fight for him at @entity41			2
the question is whether we could get one of the world champions to fight over here			0
from that point of view , @entity14 seems more willing to travel , so we ’ll wait and see how it pans out in the next few weeks			0
@entity2 , seen here during the fight with @entity4 , sports the @entity51 badge on his shorts and robe a @entity37 homecoming at @entity41 is on the cards for @entity2			1
