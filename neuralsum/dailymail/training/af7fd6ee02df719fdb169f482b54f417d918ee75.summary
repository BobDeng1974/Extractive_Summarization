the stunning photograph is one of a series of crystal - clear shots of insects taken after the morning dew had settled on a garden in @entity15			1
amateur photographer @entity16 was inspired to pick up his camera after watching insects clambering over some of his children 's marbles left on a wet garden table			2
looking good : the tiny ladybird dangles on the tip of a plant stem and appears to gaze at its reflection in a shallow pool mr @entity28 , 42 , also snapped the ladybird and a snail perched on a plant stem and reflected in a perfectly still pool of water below in his garden in @entity35 , @entity36			1
' when i saw a spider on the wet garden table i was interested in immortalising it , ' he said			2
' for a second the spider seemed to be trying to escape from the marbles , and was apparently afraid of the water			0
but when he realised it was n't deep he continued to revolve around the marbles quite happily			0
' a little while later i returned him to his natural habitat in some plants nearby , ' he said			0
the photographer reached for his camera upon seeing the insects clambering over some of his children 's marbles left on a wet garden table mirror image : the striking pictures were captured by macro-photographer @entity16 mr @entity28 , who works for a finance company , took up macro photography - extreme close - ups of small subjects - last year			1
' i like macro photography because you see many amazing things about insects ' behaviour , ' he said			0
it takes a lot of patience on my part though			0
' in this situation , i watched the insects and waited for that wonderful moment when they would play on the marbles or twigs			0
' normally they avoid water , but when they know it 's not deep and that they can walk on it they are happy to			0
' you need a bit of luck to catch the insects showing a beautiful and natural moment at the same time as the water produces a good reflection , ' added the photographer , who said his favourite pictures were those of the ant and the spider with the marble			1
the pictures are hanging on the 42 - year - old 's living room wall in @entity15			1
