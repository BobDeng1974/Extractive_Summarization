domestic violence is still a largely hidden crime , and police forces have been criticised for poor data collection on the issue			1
but based on current estimates , it is believed that 30 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16			1
almost 40 per cent of domestic violence victims are thought to be male , with an estimated 720,000 men attacked in the last year , compared to 1.2million women			2
that gap narrows considerably when it comes to the most severe type of abuse , with 1 per cent of men falling into that category , compared with 1.4 per cent of women			0
while the issue is now more widely reported by all victims , men are still twice as likely to stay silent after abuse			0

' according to @entity174 statistics , 2.7 million men have experienced some form of domestic abuse in their lifetimes , with 700,000 victims reported in 2012/13 alone			0
