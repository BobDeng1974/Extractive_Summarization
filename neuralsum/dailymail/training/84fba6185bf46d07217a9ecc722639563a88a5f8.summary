prosecutor @entity78 said : ‘ you are asked about the size of the boxes , if you look at where we can see that on this particular document [ an order form ] the @entity88 , it says 5 x 50 ... in total to satisfy this order this order was 10 boxes ? ‘ that ’s correct , ’ replied mr @entity45			0
the order was for 1.25kg of tobacco and only made up one part of a larger list of requests for deliveries to the @entity10 in may 2010			0

530,000 50g pouches of rolling tobacco were ordered to the @entity68 , the court was told four of the defendants - @entity11 , @entity27 , @entity110 and @entity135 - were employed as diplomatic staff and were therefore entitled to enjoy the tax - break on goods such as alcohol , perfume and tobacco for personal use			1
@entity43 , @entity112 and @entity113 were locally employed and therefore not entitled to the privileges			0
@entity114 was employed by the @entity144 whose offices were in the same building as the @entity147			0
