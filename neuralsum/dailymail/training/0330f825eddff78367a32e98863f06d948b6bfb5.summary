by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 26 september 2013 the @entity1 and @entity2 have always been trend - setters , even more so since the birth of @entity5			0
but one phenomenon they might not be pleased to be associated with is a recent spate of dog thefts			2
thefts of stolen black cocker spaniels , which resemble the couple 's dog @entity12 , have reportedly increased dramatically since the newest royal canine was thrust into the spotlight			1
trend - setter : @entity12 , right , was adopted by @entity18 , and featured prominently in this family portrait , showing newborn @entity5 a professional pet detective has said he is investigating a record number of stolen @entity12 lookalikes , which he suspects have been taken by criminal gangs looking to cash in on the breed 's popularity			1
we are currently looking for 13 and have recovered five in the past 12 months , ' @entity26 , director of the @entity28 agency , told the @entity30			0
' they are the tip of the iceberg , as a lot of people probably do n’t realise that their dog has been stolen			0
many may think they have been run over or just gone astray			0
' ' it is not travellers or thieves that are for the most part responsible , but organised gangs who have people who want these dogs			0
' @entity48 's best friend : @entity12 is often seen out and about with the @entity1 and @entity2 although demand for particular breeds of dog can fluctuate drastically according to the fashion of the day , respectable breeders often do not wish to meet the new demand , which can lead to people trying to acquire the dogs illegally			1
figures released in january this year suggested that the number of reported dog thefts had rocketed by 17 per cent to more than 3,500 a year			0
the biggest increase was said to be in black cocker spaniels after it was revealed that @entity62 and @entity2 adopted @entity12 in december 2011 , which can now sell for up to £ 1,000			1
in april this year a black cocker spaniel which looked just like @entity12 was stolen from a farm in @entity66			1
@entity67 , who bought @entity68 for the three - year - old son , is convinced a breeder snatched her dog so she could produce more puppies			0
police investigated the theft of the dog , which was microchipped , but were unable to find the animal			0
the @entity77 , which vets dog breeders in the @entity79 , said that general interest in cocker spaniel puppies had increased 9 per cent since @entity12 was introduced to the world , while the number of puppies being born each year - around 23,000 - had remained the same			1
since he joined the family , @entity12 - whose name was kept secret until he was three months old - has been a regular fixture of @entity48 life , and appeared prominently in the first official photograph of newborn @entity5			2
@entity2 was often spotted walking @entity12 around @entity90 , where she lived while @entity62 was serving as an @entity93 search - and - rescue pilot until earlier this month			2
the duchess - whom a friend said was ' besotted ' by @entity12 - received the dog as an early @entity97 present from her parents after he was bred from their family pet .			1
