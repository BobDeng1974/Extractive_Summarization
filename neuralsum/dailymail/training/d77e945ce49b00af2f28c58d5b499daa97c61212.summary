they make a range of noises , including a series of short grunts , known as a ' grunt train ' , along with a low growl , that can be used when a male is guarding his nest			2
the long hums the fish are well - known for however can last up to an hour and are produced by two muscles contracting on the swim bladder			2
while they have been known to prevent some living close to water from getting to sleep , research into their ' singing ' could prove to be beneficial to humans			0
the fish is able to avoid deafening itself with its own noise by turning down its sensitivity to noise , a mechanism which could also be used by humans			1
