@entity0 , 50 , is accused of groping the women , aged between 22 and 66 , during medical examinations , often while making lewd sexual remarks			1
@entity0 was aroused while he made the ‘ intimate examinations ’ , @entity16 @entity15 heard			1
a jury was told he would either ask the women to remove their clothes , or on some occasions remove them himself without warning			2
he would then touch them inappropriately and repeatedly , sometimes for prolonged periods and without wearing surgical gloves , the court heard			1
some of the alleged victims were also complimented on their physical appearance and asked invasive questions about their sexual history			1
according to neurosurgeon @entity30 , the doctor had no reason to carry out such medical examinations and most women were experiencing unrelated problems with their necks and spines			2
@entity0 , who worked at @entity16 ’s @entity37 and the city ’s private @entity39 clinic for more than a decade , denies 14 counts of sexual assault between may 2009 and june last year			1
@entity43 , @entity44 , prosecuting , told the court : ‘ @entity0 was a consultant in neurosurgery who dealt with disorders affecting the skull , spine and nervous system			1
‘ it is the prosecution ’s case that he performed unnecessary and medically unjustifiable intimate examinations on each of the ten women			0
‘ he ignored @entity58 guidelines about intimate examinations and failed to record the examination ’s findings in case records so as to cover his tracks			0
‘ his purpose in touching the private parts of these women was not medical but sexual			0
‘ in failing to observe the first rule of medicine , to do no harm , he betrayed the trust of his patients and his fellow professionals			0
’ he said that @entity0 often ‘ avoided having a chaperone ’ , which any patient can legally ask for during medical examinations			2
one patient , who was the first to report the alleged crimes last november , told officers that he had asked her to lie on a bed then , when she looked away , he undid the button and zip on her skirt			2
‘ the patient had been to see the surgeon with back and urinary problems , ’ said mr @entity43 , who added that she told police @entity0 had touched her intimately			2
the court heard she was ‘ left frozen to the spot ’ before he told her ‘ you are a sweet girl ’			1
the alleged victim then ran outside the hospital and ‘ burst into tears ’			0
@entity0 is alleged to have sexually assaulted ten of his female patients while he was working at the @entity98 ( pictured ) and @entity39 hospitals in @entity16 the ordeal left her feeling ashamed and embarrassed , ’ mr @entity43 said			1
‘ an expert says these examinations should have been done by a specialist gynaecologist , not a neurosurgeon			0
’ the jury was told about another patient , a 42 - year - old woman whom he saw on several occasions who had a neck injury and resulting urinary incontinence			1
mr @entity43 said : ‘ he told her she had a “ beautiful body ” , asked her when she had orgasms , if she masturbated and then asked her to show him how			0
‘ the examination was entirely inappropriate as her problem was in the neck			0
‘ eventually he told her he could no longer care for her as he had developed feelings for her			0
’ the alleged assaults at @entity127 ( pictured ) and @entity98 hospitals are alleged to have taken place between may 2009 and june 2013 the court heard @entity0 , of @entity131 , @entity16 , trained in @entity132 and moved to @entity133 in 2000			1
after the first patient reported him and a criminal investigation began , a letter was sent to all of @entity0 ’s female patients saying an unnamed doctor had been accused of misconduct			2
this is when his other victims came forward			0
mr @entity43 said : ‘ he will argue that in some cases what he did was medically justified and that in others that allegations are incorrect , that the assaults never happened			0
‘ the fact that these women reported what had happened separately makes it legitimate and not the result of malicious intention			0
