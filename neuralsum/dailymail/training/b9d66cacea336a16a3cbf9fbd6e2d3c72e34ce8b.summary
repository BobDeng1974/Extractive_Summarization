controversial mp @entity0 was heckled on @entity1 last night after the ' provocative ' decision by the @entity3 to invite him on the show in a @entity6 area			1
during the the hostile hour - long political debate the crowd shouted ' you are not welcome in @entity10 ' and accused him of fuelling anti-semitism in @entity12			1
after the recording @entity14 supporters waving flags and chanting attacked his car as he left the venue in @entity18 , north @entity10			2
the @entity20 mp for @entity21 claimed afterwards presenter @entity22 mishandled the debate , a question was changed at the last minute and said ' it was n't an audience it was a hit squad '			1
mr @entity0 has hit out at the @entity3 following his appearance on the show , saying he was set up and that @entity22 privately apologised to him afterwards			1
the mp is circled on the left @entity3 bosses caused consternation after they invited mr @entity0 onto the panel in @entity18 , which has the largest jewish community of any parliamentary constituency in the @entity12			1
last year mp mr @entity0 was interviewed by police on suspicion of inciting religious hatred after he declared his @entity53 constituency was an ' @entity55 - free ' zone			1
he previously refused to debate with a student at @entity57 because he was @entity55			2
tensions boiled over when @entity1 audience member @entity59 asked him : ' why is anti-semitism rising in the @entity12 and does a certain member of the panel bear some responsibility ? ' as mr @entity0 was about to answer others then shouted : ' you 're not welcome here ' and called him ' scum '			1
mr @entity0 said : ' am i on trial here ? @entity70 and @entity55 are different things from @entity72 and @entity73			1
' anti-semitism is a foul form of racism that in the 1930s led to the @entity78			0
if i had been born then i would have been the first in the line in the recruitment office to fight fascism '			0
another audience member yelled : ' you support @entity84 ' and mr @entity0 was accused of supporting violence against @entity6			1
he told the crowd : ' you are in favour of some political violence but against other political violence			0
you 're in favour of freedom of speech for some people , but not for others '			0
he added : ' you will not stop me speaking however much you shout ' and told them : ' you be the lions , i 'll be @entity97 '			0
other guests on the programme included education secretary @entity100 , her shadow counterpart @entity101 and @entity104 columnist @entity103 , @entity12 's @entity6 community had reacted with fury to the decision to have him on the show			1
@entity109 , the @entity109 mp for @entity18 and @entity110 , said the invitation was ' deliberately provocative '			1
he added : ' the @entity3 ca n't have done it by accident			2
' given what 's going on in the world it is a slap in the face for the local community			0
' mr @entity109 and the @entity121 , which brings together major @entity6 organisations , wrote to the @entity3 challenging the decision , and asked whether it is a ' responsible move '			2
the @entity125 , a charity which monitors anti-semitism and organises security for schools and synagogues said : ' if the @entity3 did n't understand the strength of feeling in the community about @entity0 , i think they understand it now			1
' upset : the @entity20 mp for @entity21 , second left , claimed afterwards presenter @entity22 , centre , mishandled the debate mr @entity0 was thrown out of the @entity137 in 2003 but made a comeback with the @entity20 in 2005 in @entity10			1
he returned to @entity139 in march 2012 after winning the seat of @entity141 in a by - election			0
he was interviewed by @entity143 last august after saying at an event , which was filmed : ' we have declared @entity53 an @entity55 - free zone			1
we do n't want any @entity55 goods ; we do n't want any @entity55 services ; we do n't want any @entity55 academics coming to the university or the college			2
' we do n't even want any @entity55 tourists to come to @entity53 even if any of them had thought of doing so			2
we reject this illegal , barbarous , savage state that calls itself @entity55 - and you have to do the same			1
' in november 2012 , during an anti-israeli demonstration in his @entity53 constituency , he told those present : ' we do not hate @entity6			0
we hate @entity70 , we hate @entity55 , we hate murder and injustice			0
' the @entity1 controversy centred around a question that one audience member asked about a rise in @entity165 in the @entity12			1
but the question also included a reference to the mp for @entity21 bearing some responsibility for this rise , an inclusion he said that had not been agreed beforehand			0
crowds : @entity12 's @entity6 community had reacted with fury to the decision to have him on the show and protested in numbers with @entity55 flags the anti-war politician said the host @entity22 later apologised to him for this , but it represented what he said was a set - up within the @entity3			1
' a lot of people are very unhappy about it as it was a set - up , ' he said			0
' it was very poorly chaired by a man i admire but who let himself down immensely			0
it showed the opposition in a very bad light and i do n't know who was advising them			0
' it is defamatory and worse and it was not the question that was asked			0
the question that was tabled and agreed was not the question that was asked			0
' he added his own words and @entity22 should have stopped and re-shot that question , as it 's not a live show			2
' @entity22 apologised to me afterwards for the man adding on that bit , but he should have made it clear to the audience that this trick had been played and not just apologise afterwards			2
' to accuse a parliamentarian of 27 years of being responsible for a spike in @entity165 is totally ludicrous			0
' security : police outside the @entity218 in @entity18 , but mr @entity0 said there was not enough security mr @entity0 also took issue with the make - up of the audience , saying there was not a single muslim among them , despite there being many in the borough where it was filmed			1
fellow panel member @entity103 also did not escape his ire , as he said he had stoked the fires and for that he would never forgive him			0
' there was not a single @entity225 person in the audience even though there are 50,000 muslims in the borough , ' he said			0
' @entity103 was the prosecutor in chief , he lit the touch paper and then smugly retired and for that i will never forgive him			0
' any anti-semitic attack of any kind is utterly despicable but there are at least ten times the number of attacks on mosques			0
' mr @entity103 claimed there had been 1,000 attacks on @entity6 but there have actually been 84			0
' the impression was given that people are roaming around the @entity12 looking for @entity6 to attack but far more people are walking around @entity12 looking for @entity225			0
' mr @entity0 giving a speech to @entity255 in @entity53 last year , where he declared @entity53 as an ' @entity55 - free zone ' a @entity3 spokesman said : ' @entity1 invites panellists who reflect a significant range of opinions on a number of different topics			1
' whilst mr @entity0 's views are entirely his own , as an mp he has a right to appear on the programme and has done so previously			1
' subjects for discussion are chosen by our audience ahead of each show and this edition of @entity1 will be no different			2
' the @entity3 later said in a statement : ' we are satisfied the programme was conducted appropriately and fairly			2
' each week @entity1 aims to have an audience that reflects the ethnic make - up of the area where we are filming , as well as being politically balanced			1
' this week 's audience was no different and included people from a range of different faiths			2

respect mp shouted at throughout this week 's edition of @entity1
@entity286 came from @entity18 , home to @entity12 's largest jewish community
last year mr @entity0 declared his constituency an ' @entity55 - free ' zone
@entity293 accused him of fuelling anti-semitism and backing violence
he *tweeted* later : ' it was n't an audience it was a hit squad '
@entity264 said @entity22 poorly handled debate and switched question
@entity264 said the @entity3 's invitation to @entity264 was ' deliberately provocative '
but the @entity3 say as an mp he has a right to appear on the programme
