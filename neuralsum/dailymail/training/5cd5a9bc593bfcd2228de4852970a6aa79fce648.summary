by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 31 october 2013 it might look like a penny farthing , but in fact this revolutionary bike is made from some of the most advanced technology in the world			0
created by @entity9 to celebrate the year the @entity11 - based chemical firm was founded , the e-velocipede boasts an electric motor , 24 specially moulded types of plastic and carbon fibre framework			1
the idea behind the concept was to imagine what bike inventors during the 19th century would have come up with if they had access to modern materials			0
@entity11 engineers from @entity9 created the e-velocipede using 24 different types of moulded plastic and carbon fibre			1
it is fitted with a @entity34 electric motor and batteries hidden inside the seat the crank directly drives the front wheel			1
additionally , the rear wheel houses a @entity34 electric motor - with batteries doubling as a seat			1
led lights are built into the frame			1
only the bikes brakes , axles , and motor are still made of metal - everything else is plastic			1
the seat is cushioned with top - of - the - range moulded foam called @entity53 @entity11 - based @entity9 teamed up with @entity54 to create the @entity25			1
the velocipede became commonly referred at as the @entity56 because it had different - sized wheels that corresponded with the difference in size between a penny and a farthing coin			2
early designs for the bike originated in 1818 and it later became known as the ' bone - shaker ' because it was uncomfortable to ride due to the wrought - iron frame , wooden wheels and iron tyres			1
the e-velocipede has been designed to be much smoother			0
the tyres have been replaced with a light , durable elastic called thermoplastic polyurethane , which the makers claim is puncture - proof			0
there are 24 different types of moulded plastic used throughout the bike , with the frames of the handlebars being made from carbon fibre			1
only the bike 's brakes , axles , and motor are made of metal			2
the pedals use friction created by sliding to turn and rotate , which made it possible for @entity9 and @entity54 to remove the ball bearings			0
pedals traditionally have a spindle that threads into the end of a crank			0
the foot rest is attached to the body and rotates on bearings around the spindle			0
the seat is cushioned with top - of - the - range moulded foam called @entity103 and the @entity34 motor and battery is hidden inside the seat			2
the 19th century bike was called ' bone - shaker ' because it was uncomfortable to ride due to the wrought - iron frame , wooden wheels and iron tyres			2
the e-velocipede has been designed to be much smoother and the tyres have been replaced with a durable elastic called thermoplastic polyurethane ' join @entity9 on a unique thought experiment and travel back into time with concept 1865 - back to the year 1865 , when @entity9 was founded , ’ said @entity9			2
' this was also the time when the wooden " @entity122 " invented by @entity123 was given its first pedals , and as velocipede launched the bicycle on the road to global success			0
' the fully functional and ready - to - ride e-bike features such spectacular details as thin optical waveguides inlaid in the forks for the lights , softly sprung and at the same maintenance - free tires , and a detachable seat with an integrated battery			0
' the firm said the bike has features so advance they have n’t even found their way onto many of today ’s bikes and as a result has no plans to make the bike available to buy			2
all the materials used in the concept 1865 bike , pictured , are made by the @entity11 chemical firm			0
this includes 24 different types of moulded plastic			1
the seat is cushioned with top - of - the - range moulded foam called @entity103 and the @entity34 motor and battery is hidden behind the seat , inside the rear wheel			0

the e-velocipede is based on the @entity56 designs from 1865
it was built using carbon fibre and 24 different types of moulded plastic
led lights are built into the frame and it is *powered* by an electric motor
the designers said there are no plans to sell the *super-advanced* bike
