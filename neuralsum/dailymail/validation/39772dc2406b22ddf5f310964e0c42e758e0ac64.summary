detectives would face a 28 - day time limit which could only be extended under strict rules in the home secretary ’s shake - up			1
her proposals would lead to the biggest reform to police bail in 30 years if the @entity12 win the upcoming general election			2
home secretary @entity0 pledged to stop police from leaving suspects on bail for months and said the @entity17 would introduce rules blocking the extension of bail beyond three months unless magistrates approved mrs may ’s promise comes amid mounting anger that forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a lengthy legal limbo – only to decide eventually not to press charges in many cases			1
there has been an outcry over a string of high - profile cases where celebrities and journalists have been left on bail for long periods , often with strict curbs			2
currently there are no restrictions on how long a person can be on police bail			2
the @entity17 propose to introduce an initial limit of 28 days			1
any decision to re-bail for a total of up to three months would have to be approved by a police officer of superintendent rank or above			2

the comedian , 61 , was kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges			0
mrs may said it was wrong for a person to languish on bail without being charged			0
‘ i have been clear it is simply not acceptable for individuals to spend months , and in some cases years , on pre-charge bail with no system of review only for charges never to be brought , ’ she added			1
under her plan , there would be a presumption to release a person without bail			0
mrs may said it was unacceptable that people like dj @entity52 ( pictured ) had been kept on bail for ' months and in some cases years '			1
he was told after 12 months that he would not face sex assault charges mrs may said : ‘ these measures ensure that decisions to release suspects with pre-charge bail conditions are taken only where it is necessary or proportionate			1
’ but police and prosecutors have warned a limit could hamper complex cases , such as inquiries into fraud or historic sex abuse			0
each year , around 303,000 suspects are typically placed on police bail with about 19,600 on bail for more than six months			2
police can keep a suspect for 24 hours for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge			0

conditions can apply , such as curfews			0
in the @entity114 , @entity113 has criticised long bail periods , saying : ‘ justice delayed is justice denied			0
