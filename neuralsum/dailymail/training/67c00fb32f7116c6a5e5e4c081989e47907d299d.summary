by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 10:23 est , 20 june 2012 @entity2 chancellor @entity1 is expected to announce a eurozone bailout confusion is currently surrounding whether @entity2 is prepared to back a £ 600billion bailout scheme to rescue the crumbling euro			1
last night , @entity7 leaders were said to be inching towards a deal			2
@entity2 chancellor @entity1 was understood to be poised to announce that two eurozone funds worth € 750billion ( £ 605billion ) would be used to buy up the debts of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and others			1
the move would essentially mean @entity2 and the wealthy countries of the eurozone would underwrite struggling member states			1
but now sources are saying @entity2 may not actually be backing the package , and has so far not agreed to a deal			2
officials have already conceded the scheme will be only a stopgap – designed to reduce the eye - watering borrowing costs for eurozone members – while they take steps towards a true ‘ fiscal union ’			1
despite eurozone assistance for @entity11 ’s tottering banking sector , the interest rates charged by international lenders on its debts soared this week above 7 per cent - the danger point at which @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity37 had to seek bailouts			1
investors treated the announcement cautiously , with @entity7 shares steady today			2
the @entity43 is 0.48 per cent up at 5,613.12 ; @entity45 's @entity44 is 0.14 per cent up at 3,122.24 ; and @entity2 's @entity46 is 0.37 per cent up at 6,387.21			1
the @entity47 , worth £ 202billion , and the @entity48 , worth £ 403billion , are the schemes that would be used to buy up the struggling countries ’ debts			1
previously , the funds have been designed to make bailouts directly to stricken governments , such as commitments to austerity measures			0
but in the future , if the deal is confirmed , they would be used to buy up government debts			0
governments would be expected to have to make a request for the funds to buy up bonds used to raise cash , and conditions could be imposed			0
scroll down to see live stock market updates ... out of order : @entity45 president @entity68 ( left ) said the rates paid on borrowed debts by @entity11 and @entity12 were unacceptable , while laws put in place by @entity73 ( right ) means @entity74 will not have to contribute @entity74 does not contribute to either fund after chancellor @entity73 changed the law to get us off the hook			1
mr @entity73 , speaking at the meeting of the @entity81 group of leading economies in @entity83 , @entity84 , said last night : ‘ i think one thing we have learnt is do n’t expect a single summit to solve the eurozone ’s problems , otherwise you are going to be disappointed			0
‘ i am not claiming that this summit has solved those problems , but the eurozone is inching towards solutions			0
‘ basically , we do need to see the richer countries , like @entity2 , like @entity95 , spend some of their resources in propping up the weaker countries of the eurozone			2
‘ obviously it is difficult for them to do that , it is not a popular thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary			0
' it ’s a reminder of why we are not in the euro because i think @entity74 taxpayers would find these things difficult to stomach			0
stopping : the @entity110 has already bought ¿ 210billion in bonds issued by eurozone governments , but stopped the programme last year amid @entity2 resistance ' but @entity74 taxpayers need to see the eurozone sort their act out if we are going to get sustainable growth and jobs			2
‘ we will see what the eurozone announce over the next couple of weeks , but there is no doubt that they realise that individual measures in individual countries			0
' like recapitalising @entity11 banks and getting a @entity14 government in favour of staying in the euro and doing what is necessary to stay in the euro – are not by themselves enough			1
‘ these are systemic problems in the eurozone which require a systemic answer and we need to see measures from the eurozone that help bring borrowing costs down , that help ensure there are common resources transferred from richer countries to poorer countries , that the whole eurozone stands behind the banks of the eurozone			0
’ @entity45 president @entity68 promised ‘ mechanisms that allow us to fight speculation ’			0
he said rates paid by @entity11 and @entity12 to borrow on debt markets were ‘ unacceptable ’			1
the @entity110 has already bought € 210billion in bonds issued by eurozone governments , but stopped the programme last year amid @entity2 resistance			1
mrs @entity1 has been hugely resistant to moves that would result in her having to persuade @entity2 taxpayers that their money should be used to prop up troubled members of the eurozone			1
and @entity2 officials insisted no decisions had been reached on whether to use the eurozone bailout cash to buy up government debts			1
the latest move , which @entity81 officials suggested could be announced within days , will be seen as the first step towards sharing the burden of stricken countries ’ debts across the single currency ’s 17 members			0
centre stage : @entity170 president @entity169 ( centre ) , @entity2 chancellor @entity1 ( right ) and @entity173 prime minister @entity172 ( left ) during the @entity174 in @entity83 however , it falls short of the ‘ eurobonds ’ – collective eurozone debts – first proposed by @entity179 president @entity178			1
@entity180 , spokesman for the @entity182 's eurozone commissioner @entity181 , said it would likely only work for ' a certain time ' and would not resolve root tensions			1
he said : ' it would be financial paracetamol			2
it could soothe tension , pain and malaise , but it does not heal the root causes , the structural problems of the economies of @entity12 , @entity11 and others			2
' it is not a substitute for structural and economic reforms that can boost confidence			0
' the @entity81 summit communique , agreed last night , promised ‘ important steps towards greater fiscal and economic integration that lead to sustainable borrowing costs ’			0
in another development , the @entity170 and the @entity182 were expected to agree to negotiate a free trade deal by 2014			0
officials said the move would be worth huge amounts to economies on both sides of the @entity212			0
@entity170 president @entity169 voiced confidence in @entity7 's ability to ' break the fever ' of its raging debt crisis as he sought to calm both global financial markets and the election - year worries of voters at home			1
@entity169 , speaking at the close of the group of 20 economic summit , said @entity7 's leaders showed a ' heightened sense of urgency ' during two days of talks			1
the president maintained @entity7 had the capacity to solve the crisis on its own , indicating the @entity170 , still battling its own economic woes , would not be offering any financial pledges to help its international partners			2
he said : ' even if they can not achieve all of it in one fell swoop , i think if people have a sense of where they are going that can provide confidence and break the fever			2
' @entity169 waded deep into the summit discussions on @entity7 's debt crisis , which could have repercussions both for a @entity170 economy still struggling to recover from a recession and @entity169 's own re-election prospects			1
he acknowledged that ' all of this affects the @entity170 ' but that his administration does not have control over how quickly the @entity7 fix the problems			0
he said : ' all of these issues , economic issues , will potentially have some impact on the election			0
' mindful of his audience of voters in the @entity170 , @entity169 added : ' the best thing the @entity170 can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term			0
