@entity1 star @entity0 yawned her way through an interview with the @entity4 , telling the publication 's writer that she found the process ' a little boring '			1
according to journalist @entity13 the 11 - year - old , who features on the front cover of this weekend 's edition of the magazine , the youngster struggled to feign interest in the interview , and perhaps unsurprisingly given her age , could n't wait to put an end to his questions so she could return to her video games			1
' i try to get a few more details about what it ’s like to balance homework and @entity26 fame ' he writes			0
' “ how about three more questions ? ” she says			2
“ make them big so i can answer them big			0
” ' sometimes it gets a little boring ' : the 11 - year - old @entity34 nominee was more than happy to admit she does n't find interviews all that entertaining ' i rack my brain for another , but i ’m too slow			2
“ we ’re done now , ” she says			0
' even discussions about her @entity1 co-stars @entity42 and @entity43 - both of whom have waxed lyrical about her abilities as an actress - failed to raise much interest from the precocious youngster			1
' inquiries into inspiration and motivation elicit eye rolls , ' @entity13 says			2
' at one point , while discussing the director and co-stars of her new film , @entity1 — @entity59 is a “ really nice man , ” @entity42 is “ a really nice guy ” and @entity43 is “ really nice ” — she lets out an exasperated yawn			2
' the @entity34 - nominated star , who is the youngest person to receive a nod for @entity64 , having been nominated for her role in @entity66 when she was only six , makes no attempt to hide her boredom throughout the interview , even explaining to @entity13 that she finds the process ' a little boring '			1
' i 'm not gon na name names , ' she says			0
' but sometimes when reporters are talking it gets a little boring because i do n't have any jokes to tell because the questions are so serious			0
' clearly intent on making the @entity4 interview a little bit more entertaining , @entity0 then proceeds challenge @entity13 to try his hand at her favorite basketball - focused arcade game @entity84 , demanding that he pay up $ 1 when he loses			1
a friend - and a movie star : @entity0 reveals to the @entity4 that her schoolfriends at home do n't view her any differently , despite her successful movie career ' @entity0 ’s precocious , at times petulant charm — littered with as much toilet humor as schoolyard sagacity — is her secret weapon , ' @entity13 later says of the young star			1
' and it ’s what makes her stand out from all the pretween beauty queens who ’ve been trained to follow a script			0
' but while her interview manner might not be up to scratch , her career has continued to go from strength to strength			0
in addition to her role in big - screen blockbuster @entity1 , which is due out on december 19 , @entity0 is also set to star in two more feature films next year - and earlier this year was revealed as the first ever celebrity face of @entity109			1
she insists , however , that life at home has not changed all that much since @entity26 first came knocking five years ago			0
now and then : the youngster will soon be seen starring in a remake of hit musical @entity1 ( @entity115 ) , having made her big screen debut in @entity66 , which earned her an @entity34 nomination for @entity64 ( r ) ' of course , when strangers see me they 're star - struck because of who i am , but my friends take me as a friend because i 'm their friend — not because i 'm a movie star , ' the precocious young star explains			1
but for those who do n't know the youngster on a personal level , her life appears to be very different from that of a normal 11 - year - old			0
@entity0 has spent the last few weeks on a whirlwind promotional tour for the upcoming remake of hit musical @entity1 , in which she stars in the title role , alongside @entity42 and @entity43 - both of whom admit to being bowled over by her talent			1
' i was so impressed with her , ' 46 - year - old @entity42 said , while @entity43 said of the pressure @entity0 faced taking on such an iconic role : ' i 'm not certain that a girl that age has that kind of awareness			2
i do n't think @entity145 did , anyhow			0
