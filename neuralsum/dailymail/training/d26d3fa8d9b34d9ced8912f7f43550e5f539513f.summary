by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 05:03 est , 18 november 2013 criticised : a senior @entity2 source said miss @entity3 had been slow to grasp the enormity of typhoon international development secretary @entity3 is under fire within @entity7 for her ‘ flat - footed ’ response to the @entity10 typhoon			1
a senior @entity2 source said miss @entity3 had been slow to grasp the enormity of typhoon @entity13 and appeared out of touch with the public over a disaster that has touched the hearts of millions in this country			1
she is said to have compounded the impression by accidentally saying the disaster had taken place in @entity22 during her first big media statement on the subject			1
the source said @entity26 had been upbraided by @entity27 during crisis talks on @entity30 ’s response to the disaster last week			1
the chancellor is said to have reminded her that her department has enjoyed a controversial 30 per cent increase in its budget and told her to get aid flowing quickly to the disaster zone where thousands perished			1
‘ there is concern that we ’ve appeared so flat - footed , ’ the source said			2
‘ it ’s all been so empty and soulless			0
when she ’s talking to the media about our response it sounds like she does n’t care			0
’ treasury sources last night acknowledged that mr @entity27 and @entity26 had talks on the crisis last week but played down talk of a rift			2
‘ it did n’t happen like that , ’ the source said			0
a source close to @entity56 also talked down the row , saying she ‘ did not recognise the version of events ’			0
but the claims will fuel public concern that too little of the £ 10billion aid budget is set aside for emergency relief			1
miss @entity3 yesterday said the value of official aid to help with the disaster had now reached £ 50million			1
public donations stand at over £ 30million			1
an aide denied the @entity69 had been slow off the mark , adding : ‘ we are absolutely leading the world in terms of our response			0
’ on the @entity76 ’s @entity75 show , miss @entity3 said the government had acted as quickly as possible and was now sending warships to help			0
miss @entity3 also said the aid budget should be protected in law , to prevent future governments imposing cuts			2
when the @entity84 was first formed , ministers pledged to enshrine the commitment in law			0
but the legislation has been put on the back burner because of scepticism about the aid budget among @entity2 mps and the public			1
miss @entity3 said : ‘ i certainly hope we can find the parliamentary time to [ enshrine it in law ] but even if we do n’t , the key thing is we ’ve acted as if that law is already in place			2
’ supplies : the aid secretary looks at emergency equipment including @entity103 diggers and @entity104 on board an @entity107 c - 17 transport plane at @entity108 in @entity109 however , miss @entity3 said some countries , including @entity111 , could lose aid if they failed to collect taxes			2
@entity111 is now the biggest recipient of @entity30 aid cash			1
critics complain that the country has one of the lowest tax collection rates in the world – just 0.5 per cent of the population			0
and some believe the country could afford to fund its own development programmes if the wealthy were persuaded to pay their fair share			0
miss @entity3 said @entity30 was helping @entity111 to improve its tax take by sending officials from @entity128 but indicated that the government may have to reassess aid budgets for countries that are not doing ‘ everything they can ’			2
she said : ‘ i think we will need to look at whether we can keep on funding when a country domestically is n’t doing everything it can			0
’ warship @entity138 also arrived in the @entity10 yesterday to spearhead the @entity30 ’s emergency response to the disaster			1
the type 45 destroyer docked at the island of @entity144 in readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to the city of @entity148 on nearby @entity150 island , one of the worst affected areas			0
@entity154 ’s @entity153 will today drop shelter kits , food and medical supplies to remote areas that are yet to be reached .			0

@entity27 urged the minister to get aid flowing to the area
