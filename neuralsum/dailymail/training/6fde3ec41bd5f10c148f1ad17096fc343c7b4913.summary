compared to his wife , the @entity7 looked rather more low key , although his dapper dinner suit was enlivened with one of his signature silk pocket squares			0
she kept her rings simple the @entity1 ' floor - length gown was the work of @entity38 , the designer who created her dove - grey wedding dress , and was teamed with an organza shawl and shimmering purple clutch			1

who has long been associated with the @entity81 , and @entity0 joined the stars of the film on the orange carpet , which was decorated with tangerine , yellow and pink curtains , as well as long pink garlands			1
so captivating was the effect , @entity7 ' attention was momentarily diverted from his magnificently attired wife and held by the floral decorations that marked the way into the cinema			0
both looked delighted when , as they approached the entrance to the cinema , they were given a rousing cheer by film fans			2
but thanks to her striking necklace , all eyes were on the @entity1			0

striking though the @entity137 ' appearance was , she did have some competition in the shape of the cast of the film , which read like a @entity142 of @entity144 acting			0
