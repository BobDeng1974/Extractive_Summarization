by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 2 april 2013 a woman who suffered a series of harrowing sexual assaults at the hands of her trusted faith healer has spoken of the moment she finally , fearing he would rape her , reported his crimes to the police - and why it took her so long to admit to herself what was happening			0
@entity12 , 41 , first met self - employed alternative therapist @entity13 , 60 , from @entity14 , through the spiritual church she attended to give her respite and hope from crippling lifelong scoliosis , a debilitating and degenerative curvature of the spine that had lead to arthritis			1
a well - known and well - liked figure within the spiritual community , @entity22 suggested to @entity12 that he could cure the agonising physical complaints which several medical operations had failed to rectify with his ' healing hands '			1
desperate for anyone who could help her , @entity12 agreed to pay him a visit			1
' he was a jovial character , i 'm a jovial character , so we hit it off immediately , ' @entity12 explained to @entity43 and @entity44 on this morning today			1
' i felt i had nothing to lose			0
' she continued : ' the first time he had me on the bed and scanned his hands above my body he told me exactly what was wrong and warned i 'd end up in a wheelchair			2
i was so impressed he picked that up - that 's what i 'd been told by surgeons			2
@entity13 , a self - employed @entity59 master , who was imprisoned for sexual offences ' but then , since i also practice @entity59 , he asked me to pass my hands over him			0
when i got to the area above his groin he said , " there , you 've felt it , have n't you ? i 'm impotent			0
doctors ca n't do anything about it			0
" ' i was so embarrassed and it seemed inappropriate , but i like to always think the best of people and not judge them so the caring side of me did nothing			2
' he said to me then : " you 're not going to come back again , are you ? that 's what they all do			0
" i should have run for the hills but i was desperate			0
' things quickly became more intense			0
though @entity12 was fully clothed in the paid - for sessions , @entity22 found ways of moving his hands under her top or down her trousers , using excuses to grope her such as ' your pressure point is so deep here , i just need to put my hand under your shirt to reach it ' , and ' you 're full of so many demons , let me just unblock them by unzipping your jeans '			1
after @entity22 had begun touching @entity12 beneath her underwear , he changed			1
@entity12 said : ' his voice changed , he started breathing heavily , he was rougher and i was scared			1
i had to get out but i did n't tell - i felt ashamed that i 'd put myself in such a vulnerable situation when i should have run			0
' eventually , @entity12 came forward to the police , and then the floodgates opened			1
other women came forward , including two who had been 15 at the time of @entity22 's attack , and one who had been only seven			2
@entity22 was jailed at the beginning of march , admitting five counts of sexual assault against @entity12			1
the fraudster admitted a total of 25 offences against eight women over a 25 - year period , including indecent assault and sexual activity with a child			0
the court also heard @entity22 , who was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment , already had a conviction for indecently assaulting a girl under 14 when he was a teenager			1
@entity12 said : ' he 'd manipulated so many people , and who knows how many more that were too scared to come forward			2
but when saw him in court , sitting there with his head in his hands , i just felt pity for him			0
' @entity12 , now qualified as a holistic therapist herself , is writing a book to deal with what has happened .			2

@entity12 , 41 , met @entity140 , 60 , through spiritual church
she received *treatment* for crippling scoliosis from him
was too frightened to speak out when his touching became inappropriate
@entity22 , from @entity14 , was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment
