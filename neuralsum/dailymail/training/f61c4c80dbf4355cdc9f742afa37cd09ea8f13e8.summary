by @entity0 as if seeing the @entity2 was n't special enough , @entity1 has also been treated to rare displays of fireballs streaking across its skies this week			1
one of the fireballs was seen lighting up the sky above @entity9 on the @entity10			2
the rare event was accidentally captured by landscape photographer @entity12 , who has been working on a time lapse video showing a year on @entity10 condensed into minutes			1
the rare event was accidentally captured by landscape photographer @entity12 , who has been working on a time lapse video showing a year on @entity10 condensed into minutes recently , mr @entity12 set his camera to record the stars over the @entity20 overnight			2
describing what he discovered the next day , mr @entity12 said : ‘ as i was loading the images onto my computer , one thumbnail stood out as being quite different to the others , so i enlarged it and saw a huge streak across the sky ’			0
unsure what he had captured , he asked his @entity31 followers and they pointed to a news story about reports of a fireball seen in the sky			0
amazingly , he has since discovered that the phenomenon he recorded was a different fireball - meaning there two within 50 miles of each other at around the same time			1
this incredible picture by @entity40 shows the @entity2 being illuminated by a fireball ( diagonal streak , far mid right ) in @entity44 near the east of @entity46 in the north of @entity1 mr @entity12 said : ‘ i 've since learnt that this is an extremely rare event , and even rarer to be photographed , as the whole thing happens in less than a second			1
’ other images were captured by amateur photographers @entity40 and @entity53 in the @entity54 on monday night			0
mr @entity40 ’ snaps were taken from @entity44 , east of @entity46 , when the shooting light suddenly flew through the atmosphere			2
he said : ‘ the solar winds were blowing on and off all throughout the night and visible through the breaks in the cloud			0
‘ a huge fireball was a real highlight , which lit up the surrounding landscape for a couple of seconds as it burnt through our atmosphere			2
@entity53 took this spectacular pictures while out waiting for the @entity68 to show above the @entity69			2
the photo was taken at around about half past eight on monday night			0
he said : ' i was out to try and photograph the @entity68 and by nothing more than luck the fireball appeared and fell through the field of view of the camera ' ‘ it was the biggest one i have ever seen and there were plenty of other meteors showing , which could be part of the annual @entity86 ( corr ) shower			0

’ the northern lights are created when particle streams from the sun crash into atoms high up in the atmosphere			1
earlier this month , a powerful solar flare directed at @entity100 has put on majestic display of the northern lights across parts of @entity104 , the @entity105 and @entity106			1
this image shows a young @entity109 boy on his way to work at 4:30am looking at the light show on @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			0
the image was captured by 61 - year - old photographer @entity115 the effects are greater at the magnetic poles and weaken as they move south from the @entity118 or north of the @entity119			0
the intensity and frequency of @entity2 activity is governed by solar cycles that lasts for 11 years			1
@entity125 scientists have predicted that the current period of solar activity will reach a new peak in december			1
on an official @entity125 video , @entity129 , the director of the @entity130 at @entity131 , said that by december there should be what is termed a ‘ solar flip ’			1
this is when the conditions for viewing the lights would be at their best			0
earlier this month , a powerful solar flare directed at @entity100 has put on majestic display of the northern lights across parts of @entity104 , the @entity105 and @entity106 .			1

three photographers were able to capture these *stunning* photos on the @entity10 , @entity44 and the @entity69
the first image is a different fireball - meaning there were two or more within 50 miles of each other at the same time
the northern lights are created when particle streams from the sun crash into atoms high up in the atmosphere
@entity125 expects the best displays of the @entity2 will happen in december when solar activity is at its peak
