older adolescent girls across the world are increasingly experiencing severe anxiety and depression , a new @entity1 study has found			1
the review , which has been published in the in the @entity1 and @entity7 , looked at 19 extensive studies conducted across 12 countries and found that teenage girls in @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity13 are specifically experiencing an increase in mental health problems			1
the studies leader , dr @entity16 from the @entity17 , told the @entity18 that a combination of cultural , schooling and economic factors are most likely to be leading to the growing problem			0
' they face difficult choices and pressures and the modern education system appears to be more problematic for girls – so the issue there is the stress of making future decisions and how they cope with them			0
' however culture is also believed to have a significant impact on mental health issues within young women , who are well known to struggle with identity and appearance issues			1
' culture has high expectation on girls in terms of appearance and weight , ' dr @entity16 said			0
' there 's a lot of speculation about the pressure on girls in terms of early sexualization and concerns they have about body image			0
' however , there is also a third factor around increasing economic inequality , and that may be increasing pressures at school as well			0
' the studies leader , dr @entity16 from the @entity17 said that a combination of cultural , schooling and economic factors are most likely to be the cause for the growing trend due to the data coming from an array of countries , dr @entity16 said the exact reasons for the difference in results across genders was not entirely clear , but are most likely tied in with education and cultural pressures			2
' boys are also affected but they 're not as affected , ' he said			0
' you can see in the results that the trend in boys and girls is going up , but what is very clear is that girls have almost double the anxiety and worries as boys			1
' we do n't yet know all the answers here – each country has different pressures on their young people – and one of the odd things is that @entity108 is n't showing this increasing trend			0
' we also have to account for why we are seeing a rise in @entity13 – so it 's clearly not just a western phenomenon			2
' dr @entity16 recommended that parents , peers and medical professionals receive more education about depression and anxiety , including prevention programs being placed in high schools ' the school factor is the common denominator and the most likely factor across the multiple countries			1
' dr @entity16 recommended that parents , peers and medical professionals receive more education about depression and anxiety , including prevention programs being placed in high schools , to increase the chances of successful prevention and early intervention			1
' one of the greatest issues is that it could lead to higher rates of attempted and successful suicide - that 's the greatest risk with anxiety and depression , ' dr @entity16 said			2
' but having severe depression and anxiety in adolescence is also a predictor of having it in future life – about a quarter of kids go on to get the illnesses as adults so it is a risk factor for the future , and it also increases the likelihood of drug and alcohol abuse in adulthood			2
' although the study has no conclusive figures on the number of youth suffering from anxiety and depression in @entity1 , a population survey will be releases in 2015 with extensive figures			1
