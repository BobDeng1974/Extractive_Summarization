two huge radio telescopes have given scientists a rare look beneath the surface of the moon			1
radar signals beamed from the @entity6 in @entity7 — the world 's largest radio dish , with a diameter of 1,000 feet — penetrated deep into the moon			2
they then bounced back and were detected by the @entity13 in @entity14 , the planet 's biggest , fully steerable radio telescope at 330 feet wide			2
a lunar impact crater known as @entity18			1
the dark ¿ halo ¿ surrounding the crater is due to pulverized debris beyond the rugged , radar - bright rim deposits			2
the crater is approximately 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) in diameter and 3.5 kilometers ( 2 miles ) deep			0
to make these images , radar signals beamed from @entity6 's powerful transmitter penetrated far below the @entity28 ’s dusty surface			0
the signals then rebounded back and were picked up by the sensitive receivers on the @entity13			0
this observing technique , known as bistatic radar , has been used to study many objects in our @entity34 , including asteroids and other planets			0
researchers use this technique , called bistatic radar , to study many solar system objects , from asteroids to other planets			0
in this case , it revealed subsurface details in two lunar locales , the @entity46 and a crater called @entity18			1
scientists were able to peer 33 to 50 feet beneath the @entity46 , which is near the site where @entity51 's final manned lunar effort , the @entity53 mission , touched down in december 1972			1
light and dark areas visible in the images reveal details of rock and dust composition , researchers said			0
the radar images also provide a new perspective on @entity63 , which is about 34 miles wide and 2.2 miles deep			0
' the dark ' halo ' surrounding the crater is due to pulverized debris beyond the rugged , radar - bright rim deposits , " representatives of the @entity65 , which operates the @entity13 and a number of other instruments , said in a statement			0
the image reveals previously hidden features around an area known as @entity46 , or the @entity46 , which is near the @entity53 landing site			1
the radar observations were able to ¿ see ¿ approximately 10 - 15 meters ( 33 - 50 feet ) below the lunar surface			1
the light and dark features are the result of compositional changes in the lunar dust and differences in the abundance of rocks buried within the soil			0
' the image also shows traces of lava - like features produced when lunar rock melted from the heat of the impact , ' these images help planetary scientists interpret the complex history of the @entity28 , which is often obscured by dust layers built up over billions of years , better understand the geology of earlier landing sites , and plan for future lunar exploration			2
' @entity103 @entity102 walks toward the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) near the @entity106 flag at the @entity108 landing site of @entity53			1
scientists were able to peer 33 to 50 feet beneath the @entity46 , which is near the site where @entity51 's final manned lunar effort , the @entity53 mission , touched down in december 1972 .			1

scientists were able to peer 33 to 50 feet beneath the sea of @entity116
close to the site where @entity51 's final manned lunar effort , the @entity53 mission , landed
revealed details in two lunar locales , the @entity46 and a crater called @entity18
