princess @entity0 is now a firm fixture on the @entity3 social scene , attending a string of charity events , galas and parties every month			1
but the daughter of prince @entity9 and @entity10 is clearly still carving out time for her long - term boyfriend @entity11			1
the 26 - year - old princess was seen last night with @entity13 executive @entity11 , 31 , enjoying a date night at @entity15 just off @entity16			1
she wore a slinky black peasant style shirt on top - leaving several buttons undone to reveal a flash of décolletage			2
sticking to black , the princess wore a pair of stilettos and carried a small sequinned clutch , leaving her hair loose			0
@entity11 looked more casual than his royal beau in a pair of jeans , unbuttoned shirt , blazer and trainers			1
the princess wore a slinky black peasant style shirt on top - leaving several buttons undone to reveal a flash of décolletage the pair have been dating for over six years , and gossip is rife - denied by all concerned , naturally - that theirs might be the next royal engagement to be announced			2
last month , @entity0 's mother @entity10 spent the weekend at @entity53 as a guest of her majesty , accompanied by her ex-husband and their two daughters , leading some to speculate on the reasons for this royal rapprochement			0
ever the gentleman , @entity11 held a protective arm around @entity0 as they left the high end restaurant , which is situated inside the @entity21 hotel just off @entity16			1
@entity19 , which serves up such culinary delights as crispy pigs head , fois gras and black pudding , watercress and pickled onion salad , or macaroni and cheese with braised ox cheek brioche and bone marrow crumble , is very much in keeping with @entity0 ’s normal choice of restaurant			2
the princess is known to frequent @entity80 favourites such as @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
@entity0 looked decidedly slim in a high - waisted black skirt cinched in at the waist with a wide black belt but alongside all the high - end partying and expensive dining , @entity0 often donates her time to good causes			1
last week on september 11 the young royal tried her hand at investment banking in @entity3 at the annual @entity95 ; selling shares for a good cause , while commemorating the bank 's employees who perished on 9/11			0
the daughter of prince @entity9 and @entity10 joined a slew of celebrities as she brokered deals on the phone joining the likes of @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , as each celebrity raised money for their chosen charity			0
@entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 also gave brokering a go for a good cause .			0

@entity0 and @entity11 left @entity122 in @entity123
