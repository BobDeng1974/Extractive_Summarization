from stunning gemstones to glittering snowflakes , the mesmerising patterns of crystals can be found everywhere in nature			0
their beautiful structure has provided scientists with an understanding of matter itself , giving them incredible insights into the intricate patterns of everyday objects			2
now @entity14 - based photographer @entity13 had shed light on some of these shapes , highlighting the importance of a technique known as x-ray crystallography			1
photographer @entity13 had shed light on some of the shapes of substances created by a technique known as x-ray crystallography			1
pictured here is the rapid crystallisation of a cancer drug the method describes a process that allows scientists to find the shape of molecules and then learn more about their atomic arrangement			1
it was pioneered in the early 20th century when scientists discovered that x-rays could be used to ' see ' the structure of matter in a non-intrusive way			2
when x-rays hit a protein crystal they are scattered by individual atoms , and the way they are diffracted depends on the how the atoms in the molecule are arranged			0
using sophisticated mathematical techniques , an x-ray diffraction pattern can be used to work out the relative positions of different atoms in a molecule			2
@entity51 now use their knowledge of the structure of objects to change it and improve both its properties and behaviour			2
in this image , a tiny crystal squeezed between diamonds - the hardest structures on earth - subjects it to extreme pressures and making the crystal structure change the eye of crystallographer @entity69 reflected from her computer screen			1
the scientist creates crystals to understand how they interact with new medicines @entity75 ( pictured ) studies crystal structures that behave in strange ways			0
in this image , he has created holes in @entity81 beach in @entity82 to portray the neutron diffraction pattern from a quartz crystal crystallography is the study of atomic and molecular structure			1

for instance , the double - helical structure of @entity111 was found from an x-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample			1
mr @entity13 told @entity115 that this is perhaps the biggest breakthrough achieved by the technique			1
' crystallography is a process in which art and science overlap , ' he said			1
' but while it has achieved a great deal in science , it is very much an unsung story			0
' the 53 - year - old , originally from @entity127 , is hoping his photographs of the science and the people who made it happen , could raise the profile of crystallography			1
mr @entity13 said aspects of science can be very difficult to understand , but he hopes his images will simplify ideas to get those concepts across			1
' it opens up a new set of people that might be engaged with crystallography and the science , just as we 're engaging with the arts , ' he told the @entity147			1
in one image , technicians are shown forming a fan blade for a jet engine from titanium alloys , by injecting high - pressure argon gas at around 1,000 degrees celcius			0
crystallography experiments carried out on these blades helps to understand how their performance is affected by the materials used in the manufacturing process			2
in another image , crystallographer @entity75 was captured by mr @entity13 creating holes in @entity81 beach in @entity82 to portray the neutron diffraction pattern from a quartz crystal			2
in addition to looking pretty , the crystal shapes can also serve an important purpose			0
for example , needle - shaped crystals in drugs can be hard to analyse but finding the right crystal is the first step in the development of treatments for diseases such as malaria			0

this is one of @entity13 's favourite images of the series meanwhile , centrosomes are molecular machines that organise the process of cell division in the body			1
to understand this process better , scientists try to grow crystals and solve the structures of the proteins from which they are built			1
these crystals are of a protein that co-ordinates the assembly of this important machine			0
mr @entity13 took the images as part of the international year of crystallography , designed to celebrate the technique			1
mr @entity13 's photos are currently being shown at the @entity210 exhibition in @entity14 's @entity211			1
the exhibition will be open until the 7 december 2014			0

@entity14 - based photographer @entity13 has shed light on a technique known as x-ray crystallography
process allows scientists to find the shape of molecules and then learn more about their atomic arrangement
the technique has been vital to science , helping to *uncover* , for instance , the double - helical structure of *dna*
the new exhibition aims to highlight the structures , people and processes involved in x-ray crystallography
