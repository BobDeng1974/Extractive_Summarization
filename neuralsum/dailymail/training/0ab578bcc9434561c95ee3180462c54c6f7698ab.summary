by @entity0 while the country braces itself for more storms and freezing temperatures , the politicians in the @entity2 are found to be throwing their heat away			0
thermal images have revealed that the government building is wasting ‘ copious ’ amounts of energy due to a suspected lack of proper insulation			2
the images , taken by energy supplier npower , also found the @entity16 hotel was leaking energy , yet the @entity18 in @entity19 was found to be the most energy efficient			1
this discovery was made worse by the fact 36 % of people said they do n't have insulation in their own homes because the government does n't offer enough support @entity22 claims a quarter of heat loss in homes is through the roof , due to poor insulation			2
the firm worked out that average three bed home in the @entity42 could save £ 140 a year by installing cavity wall insulation			0
solid wall insulation could save customers £ 490 , while loft insulation could reduce their bills by £ 180			0
@entity22 's national survey also found that the main reasons for not putting energy saving improvements in place include : 42 per cent not being able to afford it , 36 per cent blaming lack of government support and a third who claim the problem is n’t big enough			1
this discovery is made worse by the fact 36 per cent of people claim they have n't got sufficient insulation in their own homes because the government does n't offer enough support			0
@entity22 took the images as part of a nationwide campaign looking into energy efficiency and insulation			1
@entity22 's @entity42 heatmap also found that @entity42 ’s most exclusive homes , including those in @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , are among the worst for heat loss			1
in the @entity19 borough of @entity71 and @entity72 , 83 per cent of homes do n’t have cavity or solid wall insulation			1
at the other end of the scale , and country , people living in the @entity80 and @entity81 conserve the most heat - with 65 per cent of homes in both regions filling in their walls			1
@entity22 also accused the @entity16 hotel on @entity90 , pictured , for leaking heat			1
the energy supplier took the images as part of a nationwide campaign looking into energy efficiency and insulation the most energy efficient building photographed by npower was the @entity18 in @entity19 , pictured the boss of npower was , himself , accused of wasting energy at his home earlier this week after images from two properties belonging to @entity104 , the energy firm 's chief executive , showed evidence of poor insulation			1
@entity104 owns two homes - one a 16th century country property in @entity110 , @entity111 and another terrace home in @entity113 , south @entity19			2
thermal images taken of both properties found them to be ' far less energy - efficient than the average family home , ' according to @entity118 from independent consultancy @entity119			2
according to the heatmap , more than half of @entity42 ’s 26million homes are wasting energy by allowing heat to escape through walls and roofs			1
for example , in @entity128 , only 27 per cent of homes meet the guidelines for loft insulation			0
commenting on the findings , @entity133 , from @entity132 said : ‘ alarmingly , more than half of home owners still do n’t know how to establish how energy efficient their home is and are missing out on cost savings which could run into 100s of pounds each year			1
' @entity22 worked out that average three bed home in the @entity42 could save £ 140 a year by installing cavity wall insulation			1
solid wall insulation could save customers £ 490 , while loft insulation could reduce their bills by £ 180			0

elsewhere , only 27 % of homes in @entity128 meet the requirements for loft insulation thermal images taken of both properties found them to be ' far less energy - efficient than the average family home , ' according to @entity118 from independent consultancy @entity119			2
a number of energy suppliers headquarters were also captured on thermal imaging camera in november last year			0
images were taken at head offices of four of the big six suppliers : @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity177 in @entity19 , @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity180 and npower in @entity182			0
experts said the pictures reveal just how much energy the companies are wasting			0

this is @entity104 's home in @entity111 a number of energy suppliers headquarters were also captured on thermal imaging camera in november last year			0
this photo reveal how much heat is leaked by the @entity200 in @entity176 the @entity201 in @entity182 is caught leaking heat in this thermal image			0

@entity22 tested the energy efficiency of @entity19 **landmark*s* and @entity42 homes
while the @entity18 was found to be the most energy efficient *landmark*
houses of @entity214 and the @entity16 waste ' copious ' amounts of energy
@entity218 reveals homes in @entity72 and @entity71 waste the most energy
the most energy efficient homes were in the @entity80 and @entity81
