by @entity0 published : 00:14 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 6 february 2013 at least five people were killed today when a powerful earthquake followed by a damaging tsunami struck the small @entity5 nation of the @entity6 – where prince @entity7 and his bride spent a holiday last september			1
the major 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck the @entity12 islands , which are part of the @entity6 , just 250 miles from the private island of @entity15 , where prince @entity7 and @entity16 enjoyed a brief visit five months ago			1
waves of 1.5m struck the western side of the @entity12 , smashing down at least three villages and destroying up to 50 homes			2
' we 're expecting quite a few more casualties ' said mr @entity38 , the hospital 's director of nursing			2
reports from the region , lying to the east of the @entity6 capital , @entity44 , were still coming in last night , but mr @entity38 said he believed hundreds of people around @entity28 may have been affected by the tsunami which was stirred by the earthquake			1
the @entity6 police commissioner , mr @entity49 , said police patrols were sifting through damaged villages looking for dead and injured residents			2
' sadly , we believe some people have lost their lives , ' he said as the local hospital began counting the dead who were being brought in			2
this was some of the damage a tsunami and an earthquake inflicted on the @entity6 in 2007 this bulletin released by the @entity63 shows the area affected by the tsunami warning following a major earthquake measuring 8.0 magnitude off the @entity6 when the quake hit , the @entity63 in @entity68 , noticing that waves had been generated , put out a widespread alert throughout the @entity5 , warning that a tsunami might strike the @entity6 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
the warning resulted in thousands , including tourists , leaving their homes , hotels and places of work to flee to higher ground – in case a large wave came sweeping in			1
in the @entity6 capital , @entity44 , people stood on hilltops looking out to sea , ' trying to observe if there is a wave coming in , ' said mr @entity97 , a spokesman for the prime minister			0
the earthquake was yet another reminder of the undersea danger that exists for nations on the so - called @entity5 ' @entity103 ' , an enormous zone of volcanic instability that encircles the @entity106			1
the ' ring ' embraces @entity108 in the west to the coast of @entity111 in the east in a 40,000 kilometre arc of seismic violence that unleashes earthquakes and volcanoes around the @entity5 ring virtually daily			1
the ring is actually an interconnected circle of cracks in the @entity121 's hardened upper crust which are under constant pressure from molten rock below			0
just how volatile – and dangerous – the region is was demonstrated on december 26 , 2004 , when a 9.4 magnitude quake struck off @entity108 , unleashing tsunamis that smashed into @entity128 shorelines killing more than 220,000 people , including 149 @entity130 , and left millions homeless			1
royal entrance : @entity16 steps off the plane as her and prince @entity7 arrive on @entity133 in the @entity6 last september @entity134 , who works for the @entity135 in @entity44 , said most people were remaining calm			1
' people around the coast and in the capital are ringing in and trying to get information from us and the @entity142 and are slowly moving up to higher ground , ' @entity134 said			1
' but panic ? no , no , no , people are not panicking			0
' dr. @entity145 , the medical superintendent at the @entity146 in @entity44 , said the hospital asked about half its 200 patients to leave and stay with families or friends as a precautionary measure because the hospital is located near the shoreline			0
those patients who were n't mobile enough to move stayed , but the hospital remained ready to evacuate them			0
@entity145 said there had been no flooding and he hoped the hospital would return to normal on thursday			0
he said his staff was ready to mobilize to @entity12 because the small hospital there has no doctor after the previous one recently died			0
an official at the disaster management office in @entity73 said there were no reports of damage or injuries there			0
more than 50 people were killed and thousands lost their homes in april 2007 when a magnitude - 8.1 quake hit the western @entity6 , sending waves crashing into coastal villages			2
the @entity6 comprise more than 200 islands with a population of about 552,000 people			0
they lie on the ' @entity103 ' - an arc of earthquake and volcanic zones that stretches around the @entity103 and where about 90 percent of the world 's quakes occur			0
the @entity185 said wednesday 's quake struck 81 kilometers ( 50 miles ) west of @entity28 at a depth of 28.7 kilometers ( 17.8 miles ) .			0

@entity189 likely to be the worst affected region in the @entity5
thousands of villagers head to higher ground as a precaution
