@entity0 will be hoping to stop the revolving door to the @entity4 manager 's office , but he was not helped by @entity5 scoring a double for @entity7 to twice come from behind			1
swapping four managers in 37 days had not stopped @entity4 topping the table ahead of the match and they dominated their opponents			2
@entity0 's appointment came out the left field – @entity14 once paid £ 1.7million for him when he was a defensive midfielder – and the 46 - year - old 's managerial career has taken him to @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity5 nods home at the back post for @entity7 to seal them a point at @entity24 @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity25 5 ; @entity26 6 , @entity27 5 , @entity28 5.5 ( @entity29 84 ) , @entity30 5 ; @entity31 5 , @entity32 4 ( @entity33 50 , 5 ) , @entity34 6 ; @entity35 7.5 , @entity36 7.5 ; @entity37 7 ( @entity38 65 , 5 )			1
subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43			0
@entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity45 5 ; @entity46 5 , @entity47 4.5 , @entity48 4.5 , @entity49 5 ; @entity50 5 , @entity51 5 , @entity52 5 ; @entity53 5 , @entity54 5 ( @entity55 90 ) , @entity56 7.5			2

man of the match : @entity56			0
his first home game in charge of @entity4 should have ended with a win , but @entity65 's resilient @entity7 side fought back twice to level			1
@entity0 only took charge of his first @entity4 game on saturday – a 3 - 0 win away to @entity79 – and has not had long with the side , but he is already getting them to play slick football			1
in the opening half - an - hour , it was pulling @entity7 apart			2
on 20 minutes the ball moved swiftly from @entity86 to @entity35 to @entity87 , who took a touch before trying to poke the ball past @entity7 goalkeeper @entity45			1
only his legs stopped the ball from going in			0
another flowing move set up @entity87 again in the 27th minute			0
@entity31 sprayed a ball out to the left to @entity35 who cushioned it first - time into the path of the @entity4 striker on the edge of the box , but he was again denied by @entity45			0
two minutes later , one of their fine passages of play was finally rewarded			0
this time @entity32 crossed , @entity34 helped the ball on with a lovely flick with the back of his heel and @entity37 put the ball in from close range			1
@entity37 put the home side ahead in the first half with a crisp finish from close range past @entity45 @entity37 celebrates his fourth @entity115 goal of the season after making it 1 - 0 in the 28th minute of the game it was such a shame , then , that all @entity4 's work was undone by diabolical defending in their own half , to allow @entity7 to equalise within another two minutes			1
@entity32 passed straight to opposition winger @entity5 30 yards from goal and he ran at @entity27 , left him for dead on the edge of the box before finishing low past @entity4 goalkeeper @entity25			2
@entity35 twice forced @entity45 into parrying awkward swerving efforts and sent another dipping narrowly over the bar			0
so when the half - time whistle blew , @entity0 could be forgiven for feeling frustrated with the scores level			0
@entity56 is congratulated by his team - mates after making it 1 - 1 with an angled finish in the first half @entity87 points to the stands after putting @entity4 back in front from the penalty spot in the second half @entity4 started the second half in the manner in which they played the first – dominating their opponents			1
and it did not take long until they went ahead , in the 52nd minute			0
another rapid , flowing break ended with @entity35 crossing low to @entity87 who was about to score from six yards out when he tangled with @entity7 defender @entity48 and a penalty was awarded			1
@entity87 got back up to stroke the spot kick into the bottom right corner , with @entity45 flying in the other direction , for his fifth goal in seven games			0
but again , on 67 minutes , poor play at the back cos the home side and left @entity56 unmarked at the back post to power in @entity53 's cross to level			2
but @entity56 has the last laugh as he sneaks in at the back post to make it 2 - 2 and grab a point for @entity7			2

@entity37 put @entity4 ahead from close range but @entity5 equalised for @entity7 with an angled shot two minutes later
@entity87 *restored* the hosts ' lead from the penalty spot in second half
but that did not last long as @entity56 struck again after *68* minutes
@entity4 's *dropped* points , coupled with a @entity172 win away to @entity174 , meant @entity0 's side drop to second in the @entity115
