by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 25 june 2013 getting rid of large unwanted items is normally something of a chore , but a group of fundraisers have come up with a novel solution			0
they commissioned a 60ft trebuchet that hurled a car , a church organ and a petrol bomb to raise money for a church near @entity14 , @entity15			1
the novel idea came from @entity17 who said he wanted a catapult ever since he saw the medieval weapon being used 20 years ago			0
after its launch the red @entity40 was left a crumpled wreck when it was launched around 100ft into the air while the organ made an almighty crash as it hit the floor			2
mr @entity17 , owner of @entity47 , said he was happy with his efforts and had realised a long - held dream			0
he said : ' ever since i first saw a trebuchet in action nearly 20 years ago i have wanted to include one in a project and tying it in with one of our vintages seemed like an ideal opportunity			2
' the event went a long way to providing @entity39 with a new organ , the trebuchet will hopefully continue to be used for fundraisers for many years to come			1
‘ it is being painstakingly taken apart and shipped to the vineyard near @entity67 before then being rebuilt			0
' i 'm planning to raise funds for various projects in @entity70 by people donating to watch the trebuchet flinging items such as empty wine barrels			1
’ preparing to fire : the car is attached to the trebuichet before being fired swinging into action : the car is lifted into the air by the catapult lift off : the car gets ever higher into the air before being hurled downhill in the field free fall : the car flies through the air before crashing into the ground wrecked : the damage to the car from the force of the impact can clearly be seen			2
it is almost impossible to tell which is the front of the car and the back grounded : the car looks like it has already gone through the breakers yard such is the damage from the impact the @entity17 family bought @entity47 in 1995 since when it has supplied wines for the likes of @entity102 , @entity103 at @entity104 , @entity105 , the @entity106 and @entity107			0
musical monster : a @entity39 organ is attached to the trebuchet before being launched church hymns : the trebuchet also hurled an old church organ which began to fall apart mid-air as a result of the g - force smashed : the wreckage of the church organ shows how it has been smashed to bits by the impact with the ground flying : the trebuchet also launched a petrol bomb and church organ exploding bomb : the petrol bomb explodes as it flies through the air illustrating the power of the trebuchet in medieval battles firebomb : the petrol bomb continues its flight through the air touch down : the petrol bomb lands in a puff of smoke			1

*charity* event sees car , petrol bomb and church organ hurled through *sky*
they hope to take the trebuchet to @entity70 to raise money for local causes
