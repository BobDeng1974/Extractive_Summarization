gauges in tank at @entity2 measured water motion and sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the @entity6 a composer dubbed ' @entity8 ' has today become the first in the world to perform music created by waves - in a swimming pool			1
dr @entity14 transformed his body into a ' giant baton ' by covering himself with motion sensors that controlled the water in a massive wave tank at the @entity2 , @entity20			1
the more he moved his arms , the louder and more intense the music became - just like a normal conductor			2
dr @entity14 , 42 , used the sensors on his arms to manipulate the number and size of waves created by 24 giant paddles in the pool			1
the gauges sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the music , which vaguely resembled whale song			1
raising his arms changed the pitch of the sound while joysticks also enabled him to change the volume			2
dr @entity14 ’s @entity50 was watched by hundreds of people at the university			1
it was performed after the @entity53 opened the university ’s new £ 19million @entity54 , which contains the 35m by 15m tank			1
gauges in the tank monitored the wave motion and sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the music by raising his arms , dr @entity14 changed the pitch of the music while joysticks also enabled him to change the volume			1
his orchestra of waves was watched by hundreds of people at the university dr @entity14 has put together the 12 - minute show with co-composer @entity73 , dr @entity14 said : ' i told him i wanted to be like @entity8 , controlling the waves			1
' the show went very well and people in the audience were asking whether they could buy the music			2
' you are in a building and hear the noise of the waves and the smell and see them crashing down			0
' there ’s no way of explaining what it ’s like to have dramatic sounds synchronized with that			0
' the pool also contained a special buoy which made a sound like a deep bell ringing when hit by a wave			1
the more the waves struck it , the more times the bells rang			0
four students joined in with drumming			0
foolish or wise ? an illustration showing @entity8 on his throne at the sea shore @entity8 , the second son of @entity107 of @entity108 , became @entity8 of @entity109 in 1017			0
an effective ruler , he created a unified system of government and abolished the @entity114 tax , which had seen @entity109 kings pay a tax to @entity108 lords to prevent them from pillaging across @entity109			2
however , he is best remembered for his association with trying to turn back the tide			0
it is said that his courtiers flattered him into believing he had the power to make the sea recede			0
some say that he then took his throne down to the shore and tried in vain to command the waves , until he nearly drowned			0
others suggest that he put on the futile demonstration to show his courtiers he was no fool - and thus put an end to their senseless talk			0
@entity8 died in 1035 and was buried in @entity132 .			0
