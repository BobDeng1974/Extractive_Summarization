leaning over her nine - year - old daughter to check on her homework , @entity0 felt an agonising pain rip through her right shoulder and reverberate across her back			1
‘ i ’d never felt anything like it before — it was awful , like hot pins burning into my skin , ’ she says			1
‘ i crumpled on to a chair , trying to stop myself howling in pain			1
’ thinking she ’d just pulled a muscle , 40 - year - old @entity0 spent the next couple of days on round - the - clock painkillers			1
but the throbbing in her back and shoulders was so intense , it made doing simple tasks such as driving almost impossible			1
the throbbing pain in @entity0 's back and made doing simple tasks such as driving almost impossible ( picture posed by model ) she made an appointment with a physiotherapist three days later and was stunned to hear that the pain was not caused by an injury but by 20 years of sitting at a desk			1
@entity0 , a copywriter from @entity29 , is one of a growing number of @entity32 women suffering from the barely recognised phenomenon ‘ sitting - down disease ’			1
as several recent studies have discovered , sitting for too long can be as dangerous to health as smoking			1
it more than doubles your risk of diabetes and is linked with an increase in heart disease			1
in fact , inactivity is the fourth biggest killer of adults , according to the @entity48			1
but the scariest thing of all ? the results are the same however much exercise people do when they ’re not sitting down			1
‘ most people think that if they work out every day that ’s all they need to do , ’ says researcher dr @entity53 , whose team at the @entity55 analysed 18 studies incorporating a total of 800,000 people			1
‘ but those with jobs that require sitting all day may still be at risk			1
‘ when we sit for long periods of time , enzyme changes occur in our muscles that can lead to increased blood sugar levels			1
the effects happen very quickly , and regular exercise wo n’t fully protect you			2
’ there are a growing number of @entity32 women suffering from the barely recognised phenomenon ' sitting - down disease ' ( picture posed by model ) the average @entity32 adult spends between 50 and 70 per cent of their day sitting down , whether it ’s behind the wheel of a car or in front of a desk , computer or tv			1
dr @entity87 ’s team found that people who sit the longest are twice as likely to have diabetes or heart disease as those who sit the least			1
the team also reported that sitting for long periods appears to raise the risk of kidney disease , especially in women			1
and that muscle , joint and back pain , like that experienced by @entity0 , is becoming increasingly common among middle - class high - achievers , who spend most of their lives sitting down			1
mother - of - three @entity0 used to spend ten hours a day sitting down to work as a science - journal copywriter			1
she now wishes she ’d been warned of the damage her desk job could do to her health			2
she said : ‘ it ’s been awful hitting 40 and suddenly feeling like an old woman			2
i thought i was quite fit and active , yet , suddenly , doing something as simple as lifting up one of my children , or driving , has become catastrophically painful			2
‘ i think of myself as a young woman with a young family but i ’ve been hobbling around like i ’m in my dotage			2
all because i ’ve spent years in a desk job			2
’ ‘ it ’s been awful hitting 40 and suddenly feeling like an old woman			2
i thought i was quite fit and active , yet , suddenly lifting up one of my children has become catastrophically painful ' @entity0 the back pain that told her something was seriously wrong hit in january			2
she ’d never experienced any problems before but her physiotherapist was far from surprised			2
@entity0 recalls : ‘ she told me that years of hunching over a keyboard had caused the muscles in my back to shorten , and the tissues to become like rope			2
‘ i used to spend hours at my desk every day , and i would n’t take a lunch break , i ’d just eat a sandwich i ’d brought from home			1
i ’d be exhausted after a day at work , and flake out on the sofa			1
i could probably count the minutes i was vertical each day on one hand			1
‘ before i got the back pain , i ’d already eased up on my hours and gone part - time			2
but that clearly did n’t make any difference — the damage had already been done			2
’ nearly one in four workers blame their aches and pains on working in the same position for long periods of time			1
they take a total of ten million sick days a year , costing the @entity32 economy £ 5.7 billion			1
@entity153 , a @entity155 - based osteopath and chartered physiotherapist , says : ‘ the body needs mobility			2
our spines are comprised of 26 mobile blocks of bone ( vertebrae ) which rotate , bend , extend , and are designed for movement			2
knees , hips , ankles and feet are all mobile joints , too			2
‘ sit in a chair for hours a day , five days a week and the spine does not move , the knees and hips are held in a flexed position , your body will get stiff , the muscles get weak and your body gets sore			1
‘ hunching over a computer increases compression through the discs in the spine and causes stiffness and pain			2
it can even lead to a disc prolapse — known as a slipped disc			0
’ @entity188 - based chiropractor @entity187 says that symptoms often creep up without any warning			0
‘ i use what i call the paperclip analogy , ’ he explains			0
‘ you could bend a paperclip once a day for a month and it will still function as a paperclip			1
then one day it will just break			1
i treat women all the time who think they have a new injury but it is in fact the result of years of desk work			0
their injury is caused by what ’s known as postural fixity — being stuck in one place			0
’ hunching over a computer increases compression through the discs in the spine and causes stiffness and pain ( picture posed by model ) women who wear stilettos and pencil skirts to work are particularly vulnerable , he adds			0
high heels tip the pelvis forward when we walk or stand , weakening the back ’s muscles , while slim - fitting skirts restrict our joints ’ range of movement when we sit down			0
and all the experts seem to agree there ’s no way of knowing when ‘ sitting - down disease ’ will get you			1
in the case of @entity232 , a 39 - year - old graphic designer from @entity233 , it started five years ago in her right knee			0
‘ it began to feel stiff as i worked — i ’m a computer - based designer , with a number of clients for whom i produce leaflets and booklets			0
when meeting a deadline , i stayed at my desk for up to ten hours a day			1
’ the pain gradually worsened and 18 months ago it seriously affected @entity232 ’s mobility			0
‘ i could barely get myself up the stairs , let alone go for walks with my husband , @entity249			0
i felt awful , ’ she says			0
experts agree there 's no way of knowing when ' sitting - down disease ' will get you ( picture posed by model ) ‘ in my mind i was a young , active woman , but i was hobbling like a frail old lady			1
i had this deep throbbing in my knee all the time			0
yet i had n’t banged or injured it			0
’ a hospital scan revealed acute inflammation around the knee joint			0
‘ my doctor said it was due to spending so long at my desk , and possibly because of the way i sat — leaning on one side , which was why only one knee was affected			1
i must have always sat like that , without realising			0
’ @entity232 has now had eight months of physiotherapy involving stretching exercises for her knee			0
she has also been told to lose a stone — she weighs 13st and is 5ft 7ins — as excess weight puts more pressure on her knee			0
so can you protect yourself from sitting - down disease without quitting your job ? one simple way is not to sit for longer than 30 minutes without getting up			1
‘ get a glass of water or go to speak to a colleague rather than email them , ’ advises mr @entity153			0
not slouching is vital , too			0
‘ sit up with your back straight , your shoulders down and back , and elbows relaxed at your sides , ’ says @entity286 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon			0
‘ your buttocks should touch the back of the chair			0
and avoid crossing your legs			0
’ your keyboard should be directly in front of you , with the mouse by its side , and your phone close to you to avoid repetitive reaching			0
‘ you should be able to keep your wrist straight , shoulders relaxed and elbows by your side while using it , ’ says mr @entity286			0
physiotherapy sessions to massage and manipulate the spine help combat back pain ( picture posed by models ) if you already have back , shoulder or knee pain , it ’s important to be as active as possible as this will help your joints recover mobility			0
@entity316 , a 39 - year - old mother of three from @entity317 , @entity318 , has been seeing an osteopath for her bad back			0
‘ i spent years working for a magazine , and it was such a busy job i ’d spend hours at my desk , battling with a stiff back			0
i used to crawl out of the office in agony			0
’ she also does hour - long bootcamp sessions twice a week			1
‘ i was in a lot of pain and felt very stiff but my osteopath said it would be all right and the camp leader knows my history			0
since doing core strengthening exercises , my back feels much better			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 has found that after eight physiotherapy sessions to massage and manipulate her spine , and a regular exercise programme at home to stretch her shoulders and neck , she also feels much better			0
‘ i ca n’t rewrite the past but i do n’t want to go through that pain again , ’ she says			0
‘ every time i slouch at my desk i remind myself of the agony and i straighten myself up immediately			0
