by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:06 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 23 september 2013 parents would be offered 25 hours a week of free childcare under @entity4 plans to cut bills for families			1
up to 400,000 families would be £ 1,500 a year better off under the scheme when it is roled out by 2020			1
but shadow chancellor @entity10 faced criticism for planning to fund the policy with another raid on banks , having already earmarked the bank levy for 11 other policies			1
it has also been promised for more @entity35 funding , cutting the deficit , turning empty shops into community centres , spending on public services , more housing and now childcare			0
but mr @entity10 used his speech to the @entity4 conference to argue that bankers can also pay more to cut childcare costs			1
parents of three and four year olds already receive 15 hours a week free childcare , paid for by the taxpayer			1
pledge : mr @entity10 will promise to increase free childcare from from 15 to 25 hours a week the coalition has also introduced the help for the poorest families of two - year - olds			1
mr @entity10 suggested a @entity4 government will go further and increase the help for three and four year olds to 25 hours			1
he told the conference : ‘ childcare is a vital part of our economic infrastructure that , alongside family support and flexible working , should give parents the choice to stay at home with their children when they are very small and to balance work and family as they grow older			0
‘ but for many families high childcare costs mean that it does n't even add up to go to work			0
so to make work pay for families , we must act			0
‘ conference , after the financial crisis , it is right that the banks make a greater contribution			0
but in the last financial year , the banks paid a staggering £ 2.7 billion less in overall tax than they did in 2010			2
over the last two years the government 's bank levy has raised £ 1.6 billion less than they said it would			1
‘ at a time when resources are tight and families are under pressure that can not be right			0
so i can announce today the next @entity4 government will increase the bank levy rate to raise an extra £ 800 million a year			1
‘ and we will use the money , for families where all parents are in work , to increase free childcare places for three and four - year - olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week			1
' buffers : @entity4 's shadow chancellor @entity10 also signalled that he thought the £ 50billion earmarked for @entity101 could be better spent elsewhere the ambitious high speed rail link between @entity103 and the north was dramatically derailed today , as @entity10 declared there could be better ways to spend £ 50billion			1
the shadow chancellor appeared to withdraw @entity4 ’s full - throated support for the project which it backed at the 2010 election			1
mr @entity10 said there would be ‘ no blank cheque ’ for the scheme as he signalled that other big money projects should jump the queue for funding			2
mr @entity10 backed more long - term investment in infrastructure but added : ‘ we must also set the right priorities and get value for money			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity122 and @entity123 have made clear they will go full steam ahead with this project – no matter how much the costs spiral up and up			0
they seem willing to put their own pride and vanity above best value for money for the taxpayer			0
‘ @entity4 will not take this irresponsible approach			2
so let me be clear , in tough times – when there is less money around and a big deficit to get down – there will be no blank cheque from me as a @entity4 chancellor for this project or for any project			1
‘ because the question is - not just whether a new high speed line is a good idea or a bad idea , but whether it is the best way to spend £ 50 billion for the future of our country			2
’ @entity101 will run from @entity151 to @entity152 from 2026 , and then form two routes to @entity154 and @entity155 by 2032			0
he went on : ‘ for the first time , parents will be able to work part - time without having to worry about the cost of childcare			0
' making work pay , tackling the cost - of - living crisis , a radical transformation in the provision of childcare in our country			0
’ mr @entity10 told activists the party must show how its policies are costed and funded , saying the ‘ @entity172 people rightly want to know that the sums add up ’			1
@entity4 has already announced plans for primary schools to guarantee t offer childcare from 8am to 6pm , to help working parents			2
mr @entity10 made the announcement in a speech to activists where he will also attempt to underline the party 's ‘ iron discipline ’ on spending in the run - up to the 2015 general election			2
he today dismissed as ‘ nonsense ’ @entity187 claims of a £ 27.9 billion ‘ black hole ’ in @entity4 's tax - and - spend plans , telling @entity191 's @entity190 : ‘ there are no uncosted spending commitments			1
there will be no more day - to - day borrowing from @entity4 in 2015			2
’ however , a political row erupted over @entity4 demands for the independent spending watchdog to audit their manifesto			0
mr @entity10 wants the @entity200 to be allowed to check @entity4 's tax - and - spend promises ahead of the 2015 election to prove their sums add up			1
' mr @entity10 told @entity190 : ' we think this is something we can get cross-party support for , to say that the @entity207 and the opposition should have that independent scrutiny and audit , so when we say in our manifesto this is our tax promise or our spending commitment , we can show the sums add up , but also the independent @entity200 can say they have certified and scrutinised that			2
' it 's about rebuilding trust in politics			0
there is cross-party support for the @entity200 and i want this to be for governments and oppositions			0
i am confident that when the government thinks about this they will give us that cross-party support			0
' but conservative treasury minister @entity228 said : ' @entity10 knows this is not allowed under the @entity230 and the @entity200 's charter			0
' so this is just a stunt to try and distract attention from the fact that @entity4 have been found out for making unfunded commitments that would just mean more borrowing and more debt			0
