@entity0 is often linked with depression , social anxiety and other mental health issues			1
but a new scheme hopes to reverse this reputation by using the site to instead find cures and improve treatments for diseases using the dna of its members			1
genes for @entity14 is a @entity0 app designed to survey the health of millions of social network users , who can also submit spit samples to tie their survey results to their genes			1
@entity22 ( pictured ) is a @entity0 app designed to survey the health of millions of social network users , who can also send in spit samples to tie their survey results to their genes			1
it was set up by biostatisticians from the @entity28 and is available over 18s in the @entity30 it was set up by biostatisticians from the @entity28 , and although the app is hosted by @entity0 , the site is not affiliated with the scheme in any other way			1
the app is available for free from @entity0 's store but is only currently open to people aged over 18 with a valid mailing address in the @entity30			1
the researchers do n't have any plans to extend it outside of the @entity30 at the moment , but this may change depending on how successful the scheme is			2
once a user has read and accepted the terms and conditions , which doubles up as a consent form , they are presented with health surveys they complete each day			1
sending a spit sample is voluntary , and users only become eligible once they 've completed 15 of the @entity53 questions , and each of the @entity55 over two separate days			1
the app is available for free to people aged over 18 with a valid mailing address in the @entity30			2
once a user has read and accepted the terms and conditions they are presented with health surveys they can complete each day			1
sending a spit sample is voluntary , and users only become eligible once they 've completed 15 of the @entity53 questions , and each of the @entity55 over two separate days			1
participants can withdraw at any time by clicking the withdrawal link in the @entity0 app under the ' @entity70 ' option in the upper right corner of the site			1
after withdrawing , genes for good keeps the survey responses but deletes the participant 's name and unique @entity77 from its database			2
it also removes addresses , including an ip address and physical address , and phone numbers but keeps their age , sex , and zip code information			2
it also keeps the dna			2
these questionnaires relate to a user 's health , habits , attitudes , and relationships and the @entity55 provide detailed information about how a person 's health changes over time			1
after completing each survey , uses can view their own results as well as see summaries about other how these results compare to other participants			1
once requested , a ' spit kit ' is sent free of charge and the firm said dna obtained from this sample will be frozen and ' stored indefinitely ' in a secure laboratory supervised by the researchers			1
the researchers explained : ' our goal is to accelerate genetic and health research using social media			2
' we will use the information you provide to advance our understanding of genetics , disease , behaviour , human ancestry , and our relationships around the world			0
' the findings from this research may benefit many individuals , for generations to come , as we learn more about how our genes affect our lives			0
' you can also use capabilities in @entity133 for good to track your lifestyle , habits and activities , and compare yourself to other participants			2
each member who submits a spit sample will also see a copy of their results , which include their genetic ancestry as well as raw genetic data in a securely encrypted computer file			1
similar services , such as those offered by genealogy sites like @entity150 , cost $ 99 in the @entity30 and £ 99 in the @entity151			0
this applies to the first 2,000 kits sent out by @entity154			0
the scheme has not revealed whether kits will then need to be paid for , or if this is a limited number			0
@entity157 has contacted the university for more information			0
sending a spit sample ( illustrated ) is voluntary			1
each member who submits a sample will also see a copy of their results , which include genetic ancestry as well as raw genetic data in a securely encrypted computer file ' we use @entity0 because of its vast existing social network , continued the researchers			1
' using @entity0 will allow the study to grow both quickly and optimally through word of mouth			1
' otherwise , the study is independent of @entity0			1
@entity0 can not access the information you provide to genes for @entity14			2
' you can stop participating at any time			0
you can stop answering surveys or you can delete the app from your @entity0 account			1
' @entity181 recently announced an initiative called @entity183 that plans to gather health data from @entity186 users			0
it will use , on a voluntary basis , data from medical tracking apps to help research asthma , breast cancer , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and parkinson ’s disease			0
@entity181 's senior vice president of operations @entity197 said : ' @entity183 is made for medical researchers , it lets them easily create apps			2
' @entity181 worked with @entity201 , @entity202 and others to develop this project			0
the @entity206 's connection with @entity0 may concern privacy campaigners following claims earlier this week that the social network tracks users , even if they 've opted out			2
@entity0 has more than 1.3 billion users but there are millions more visits from people who are not signed up			2
researchers from the @entity216 said @entity0 puts tracking cookies on internet users ' laptops , pcs and phones when the visit facebook.com so it can target them with online advertising			1
but @entity0 today said the report is inaccurate and the researchers had persistently ignored its request to meet			1
a spokesman said : ' this report contains factual inaccuracies			0
the authors have never contacted us , nor sought to clarify any assumptions upon which their report is based			0
neither did they invite our comment on the report before making it public			0
' however , we remain willing to engage with them and hope they will be prepared to update their work in due course			2
' ' earlier this year we updated our terms and policies to make them more clear and concise , to reflect new product features and to highlight how we 're expanding people 's control over advertising			0
members can withdraw at any time and after withdrawing , @entity247 keeps the survey responses but deletes the participant 's name and unique @entity77 from its database			0
it also removes addresses and phone numbers , but keeps their age , sex , and zip code information			0
it also keeps the dna ( stock image ) we 're confident the updates comply with applicable laws including @entity266 law			0
' after withdrawing , genes for good keeps the survey responses but deletes the participant 's name and unique @entity77 from its database			0
it also removes addresses , including an ip address and physical address , and phone numbers but keeps their age , sex , and zip code information			0
it also keeps the dna			0
and @entity247 said there are also risks : ' we have taken important steps to reduce this risk , including the utilisation of separate independent servers to host the web application and your responses and genetic data			0
' [ but ] if the genetic information is used in some way to identify you , it is possible that you could suffer psychological or emotional harm , or other unforeseen consequences			0
' it said that the @entity296 of 2008 ( @entity296 ) is a federal law that protects individuals from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment , and genetic counsellors can also be used to seek advice or support .			0

the app was designed by researchers at the @entity28
participants complete @entity55 via an app on @entity0
they can also send a spit sample that is tied to the results of the surveys
researchers said they hope to use results to help find cures for diseases
