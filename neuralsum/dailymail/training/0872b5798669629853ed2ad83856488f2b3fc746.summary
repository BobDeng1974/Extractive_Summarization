it ranks higher than getting married , choosing a school or buying a house in terms of worry			1
even getting divorced is rated less stressful , say members of the ‘ sandwich generation ’			0
these are men and women who have to care for – or arrange the care of – their parents as well as their children			2
smaller families , longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean that the number of ‘ sandwich carers ’ is growing , with an estimated 2.4 million @entity28 juggling their responsibilities for both parents and children			1
some 84 per cent of the 259 men and women questioned by the @entity34 , the hospital and care home watchdog , said deciding how to care for an elderly relative was very stressful or quite stressful – making it the top choice			1
this decision could be about whether they are well enough to stay in their own home – or it could be about which care home will look after them best			1
financial worries , fears over the standard of care and guilt about putting a relative into a home are all likely to contribute to the mental turmoil			2
and many people are forced to sell their parents ’ home to meet the high fees required to keep them in care			1
next most stressful was buying a house , with a score of 67 per cent , followed by choosing a school for a child			1
child care took fourth place in the list of six , divorce was in fifth place and getting married was sixth			2
care minister @entity0 said : ‘ choosing the right care for someone we love can be an overwhelming experience			2
there is a vast amount of information to deal with and balancing that with day - to - day pressures can be really hard			0

’ the @entity34 carried out the survey to mark the launch of a new rating scheme for care homes , which will see them ranked from ‘ outstanding ’ to ‘ inadequate ’			0
@entity100 , its chief inspector of adult social care , recently admitted that she regularly received ‘ heartbreaking ’ letters from families wracked with guilt for leaving a relative in a poor home			2
‘ week in week out people tell me and my team how inspectors discover some truly awful care which should not be happening , ’ she said			0
some experts have said the rise of the ‘ sandwich generation ’ will spell the end of a comfortable middle age			0
they predict that people in their 40s and 50s will increasingly resent taking on extra responsibility , while also faced with working longer before drawing their pension			0
the financial burden of caring for the young and old means fewer will be able to use their pre-retirement years to pay off their mortgage , go on trips and fulfil lifetime ambitions			1
@entity128 , of the @entity129 , said : ‘ like walking into a maze blindfolded , when faced with the difficult decision of moving a loved one into a care home many families struggle due to a lack of trusted information and advice			1

financial burdens means fewer can use money for what they really want
