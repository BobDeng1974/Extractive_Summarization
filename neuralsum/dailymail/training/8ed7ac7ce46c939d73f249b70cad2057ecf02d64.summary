by @entity1 reporter published : 12:13 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 10 september 2012 when a woman in @entity3 started losing feeling in her lower extremities and then her upper , she was terrified at what was happening to her body			0
when @entity9 found out that her brain was infected with a calcified tapeworm and she had to have a life - threatening surgery , the terror grew			1
her case is one of a growing number of cases popping up in the west - coast state , and now some physicians are saying that neurocysticercosis – where tapeworms lodge in one ’s brain – is becoming a first - world problem			1
emergency : @entity9 had the parasites removed in a potentially life - threatening operation in 2011 @entity27 , was told by doctors in december 2010 that she needed this surgery to extricate the growing number of parasites in her brain			1
her children were horrified that they might lose their mother			0
doctors in @entity35 , @entity3 were at first baffled by her symptoms , and first diagnosed her with a tumour			1
it was only after a ct scan revealed calcified tapeworm larvae that they knew she had neurocysticercosis			1
only about 1,900 cases are reported in @entity46 hospitals annually			0
@entity27 , who was born in @entity47 , told @entity48 that she experienced crippling headaches for more than two decades before she was diagnosed			1
she received the operation in january of 2011			0
a large part of her hair had to be shaven to allow surgeons to cut into her scalp and reach her brain			1
dangerous : the large circle indicated by the black arrow is a sucker in the brain , the dark dots highlighted with green arrows are calcified larvae of the pork tapeworm the tapeworm larvae form little nodules in the brain like this one a study published by @entity70 in january stated that 304 of the hospitalisations in the @entity46 during 2009 were in @entity3			1
in addition , 85 per cent of those identified in the state were @entity75 , with 72 per cent from the southern areas			0
many of the population are @entity79 immigrants who do not have access to proper health education and are unaware how the parasite is spread			0
tapeworm larvae are passed through direct contact with human feces			2
though her surgery was a success , some medical professionals are worried of the growing number of cysticerosis cases in the state			2
@entity93 is a common disease within third - world and developing countries , affecting 50million people globally , but is largely overlooked by physicians in @entity46 because of inexpensive early treatment options and hygiene available			1
@entity101 , a scientist with the @entity102 , told @entity48 that neurocysticercosis has been affecting a growing number of marginalised populations within the @entity46 , including immigrant @entity106 and @entity75			2
she said that these populations are not given the education necessary to prevent infections			0
according to the @entity102 , neurocysticercosis is preventable , but happens with larval cysts of the pork tapeworm enter the brain			1
it is the most severe form of cyticercosis			0
a person can become infected then they unwittingly ingest microscopic eggs			0
for instance , if an infected person who has n’t properly washed their hands after defecation then contaminates food or other surfaces , that puts others at risk for contracting the parasite			0
the larvae can then be unknowingly consumed			2
when the larvae hatch inside the body , they migrate up towards the brain			1
microscopic : a @entity137 ( @entity138 ) cysticercus is invisible to the human eye and is passed from human to human in fecal matter the @entity102 notes that the infection is preventable if people thoroughly wash their hands after using the toilet			2
treatment for neurocysticercosis is extremely costly			2
the @entity102 estimates that the average cost of hospitalisation for one infected cost $ 37,600			0
a staggering 43 per cent of the financial burden was passed to @entity151 .			0

@entity9 was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis , where pork larvae infect the brain
required dangerous surgery to extract them
infection is most common in third - world countries
