@entity0 thinks one thing protected him from too many comparisons with @entity3 as he first started to progress through the @entity5 youth ranks : he played in central defence			1
‘ my ambition was always to be a ball - playing centre half , like @entity15 , ’ said @entity0 , the 20 - year - old @entity7 seen as one of the long - term successors to @entity3 ’s @entity10 10 shirt			1
‘ @entity3 came through as a striker			1
i came through as a midfielder , but when i was younger , i was a defender and i enjoyed it			2
i played there until @entity20			2
so , i was never really compared to @entity3			1
because i ’m young , i ’ll play anywhere but in the future , hopefully in the middle of the park			0
’ it was @entity36 — an academy coach at @entity5 until he left last year to become the @entity38 ’s technical lead for the @entity40 age groups — who decided it was time for @entity0 to step forward into midfield			1
‘ i was playing up an age and i was told , “ you ’re in centre - mid today , just enjoy it ” , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i think it was because i was constantly running out with the ball from the back			0
sometimes i ’d make a few mistakes on the edge of the box and the strikers would score			0
i had to simplify things			0
’ it chimes with his experience in @entity57 before the @entity58 in @entity59 , when he produced a terrific performance in a friendly against @entity62 , only for @entity63 to criticise him for losing possession in dangerous areas			0
‘ obviously , i ’m the type of player who takes risks , so now and then i ’m going to give the ball away , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i just have to learn not to give it away in silly areas of the pitch			0
‘ i learned a lot at the @entity58 , from being around the likes of @entity74 and @entity75			0
that it ’s not a kids ’ game any more			2
a year or two ago , i was playing reserve - team football			2
it ’s a big step			2
i ’ve still got a lot to learn			0
‘ from a personal point of view , it ( playing in a @entity58 ) was a good experience			0
i always grew up hoping to play in a @entity58 for @entity10 — and i did and hopefully there will be more in the future as well			1
to lift a trophy for @entity10 is what every player wants to do			1
’ @entity0 , pictured in action for @entity5 against @entity91 , is back fit after a serious knee injury @entity0 has praised the influence of captain @entity3 ( centre ) , who is set to win his 100th cap @entity0 , pictured against @entity96 at the @entity58 , is in his first @entity10 squad since the trip to @entity59 last year was a breakthrough for @entity0 , initially making @entity5 ’s first team , and then selection for @entity10 and earning a place in @entity63 ’s 23 - man squad for @entity59 , where he played a part in all three games			1
the last 12 months have brought reward and relief after the serious injury in october 2010 which set his development back years			0
@entity0 broke a leg in three places in a freak collision with team - mate @entity113 during an @entity10 under 19 game in @entity115 in 2010			1
the @entity115 doctor who first treated the injury feared the teenager might not play again			0
‘ i came back and did well initially and made my @entity5 debut but after that i struggled for a bit , just getting my confidence back and my leg in tackling-wise , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity124 , then @entity5 boss , visited to offer personal encouragement and support , and as he recovered @entity5 purposely selected tough loan moves to @entity128 and @entity129 , so he would experience the pressure of performing in front of big crowds , although he played only four times for @entity129			1
‘ he did help out a lot , ’ said @entity0 of @entity124			1
‘ i was at home after my operation and he came around to my house , which he did n’t need to , to speak to my mum and reassure me that everything was going to be ok			0
‘ i went out on loan and it was like going from being a kid to manning up ; going into a man ’s game and getting games every week			2
at @entity129 i was working really hard			0
when i came back i got on at @entity5			1
things started to change as i was getting on the pitch more			0
i started against @entity150 and @entity151			0
’ @entity10 boss @entity63 gave @entity0 playing time in each of @entity10 's @entity58 group games @entity0 admits that winning a trophy with @entity10 in the future would be ' a dream come true ' those starts came in april 2013			1
five months later , at the age of 19 , he made his @entity10 debut , in a 4 - 0 win against @entity160 at @entity161			1
a pre-season knee injury has prevented him adding to his caps since the @entity58 but as @entity3 prepares for his 100th international appearance , against @entity165 tomorrow , @entity0 hopes for his 10th			1
still , he is not 21 yet , and young enough that his first memory of watching @entity10 came this century : @entity21 ’s free - kick against @entity168 in 2001			1
‘ i was celebrating on the couch , ’ he said			0
‘ at that moment , i really wanted to play for @entity10			1
’ these days , he can barely move for flattering comparisons			0
@entity63 likened him to @entity171 , whom @entity0 never saw play			2
‘ i was only , like , three , when he was playing at @entity5 but i ’ve seen clips on @entity174 , ’ he said			2
‘ everyone knows how talented he was			0
’ and then , of course , there ’s @entity3			1
he may have escaped comparisons in his schoolboy days , but there are similarities : scousers , @entity183 , identified for great things at an early age , with pace and power to accompany their raw talent and imagination			0
‘ @entity3 has helped me a lot since i came into the squad , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s been giving me advice about getting in the box when the wingers have the ball — not on the edge of the box but in the box — and that with my movement i will get loads of goals that way			2
‘ there are still loads of pictures of @entity3 at the @entity5 academy			1
he said he coped with it all easily , that it just came naturally			0
that ’s the way i look at it			2
i do n’t want to get big - headed			2
i do n’t feel pressure			0
i do n’t see there ’s much expectation on me			2
‘ i think , because i ’m young , every time i get on the pitch , i just enjoy playing football			0
i ’m not scared when i ’m on the pitch			0
i do n’t see anything to scare me			0
