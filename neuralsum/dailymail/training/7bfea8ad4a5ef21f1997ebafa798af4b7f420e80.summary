it is not every day you see a man walking around a cathedral square with a smile on his face and a full - grown sheep on his shoulders			2
sinister - looking black - clad riders dance stallions on their hind legs in the middle of a 20,000 - strong crowd			2
the bravest or most foolhardy revellers dash forward to touch the horses ' hearts for luck			2
the annual fiesta of @entity18 in the ancient city of @entity20 , on @entity22 's west coast , features many bizarre rituals			1
strangers fuelled by @entity25 , the local version of gin and bitter lemon , pelt you with hazelnuts ( it 's a sign of love , apparently )			2
peace and quiet , pictured : @entity22 revels in quiet coves , little beaches and turquoise seas if you jump three times over a bonfire , you can turn a bad year into a good one ( useful in the @entity41 economic climate )			1
when it comes to celebrating the summer solstice , @entity22 is the place to be			1
@entity18 is the @entity46 name of @entity47 and we 're celebrating his june birthday , although the fiesta has much older pagan origins			2
horseplay : the festival of @entity18 is a major tradition on @entity22 , with equine stunts to the fore @entity22 is the poorest and least known of the @entity57			1
we all know about @entity58 with its many hotels and reputation , in places such as @entity62 , for alcohol - fuelled package tour excesses			1
@entity64 has the coolest clubs and celebrity second - homers such as @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
@entity71 little @entity22 is the @entity57 ' shy relation , positively introverted in comparison with its neighbours - and all the better for it			1
at last , i 've found a holiday destination in the western @entity77 that is almost entirely unspoilt by 60 years of mass tourism			0
the first charter flights landed here in 1953 , but when you arrive by air in the capital , @entity85 ( or @entity85 in @entity46 ) nowadays , it comes as a welcome shock to see that almost the entire island is made up of fields and woodland , with just two small cities and a few pods of white villas scattered around the coastline			0
in 1993 , @entity94 declared the island one of the world 's 400 ' biosphere reserves '			0
curiously , the @entity97 have @entity98 to thank for this			1
in retribution for the little island 's @entity103 stance during the @entity105 , the fascist dictator spent the next 36 years denying @entity22 access to public building funds			1
as a happy result , it escaped the high - rise concrete epidemic that blighted the mainland costas			0
a quaint sort of calm : the @entity114 capital @entity20 sits prettily on the west coast of the island @entity22 is just half the size of the @entity118			1
in the middle lies @entity120 , a 1,000 ft hill with a church , a @entity124 convent and tremendous views			0
to the east lies @entity85 with its deep natural harbour , imposing @entity130 buildings and narrow cobbled alleyways			0
in the west , you can glimpse @entity20			1
the varietyof buildings in @entity85 reflects the list of invaders , including @entity138 pirates , who have invaded and occupied its streets down the centuries			0
our own admiral @entity141 was executed by firing squad for losing @entity22 to the @entity144 in 1756			1
georgian architecture apart , our legacy was gin - distilled to this day by @entity147 on the harbour in @entity85			0
busy resorts like @entity22 , @entity150 and @entity151 have enough activities to satisfy even the most lively , though for the first couple of days i found it hard to choose between flopping by the pool and basking on the sands			1
most of the best beaches , such as @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , are tucked away in isolated coves along the 116 - mile coastline			0
the @entity166 , an ancient bridleway , encircles the island , and can be explored on foot , by bicycle or , naturally , on horseback			0
take a walk with me : @entity20 is an inviting place for an evening meal or a gentle stroll when dusk falls @entity22 bears the brunt of winds sweeping in from the @entity178 and @entity179 , on the north coast , which is the best place for sailing and windsurfing			1
it is also an attractive town with boutiques , a craft market and restaurants			0
inexpensive @entity189 ( +34 619 432 291 ) has folk music and tapas such as courgette carpaccio , along with mussels poached in port			0
the seafront in @entity179 has plenty of fish restaurants and you might consider spending € 40 to € 60 ( £ 31 - £ 47 on a feast of @entity200 , a spicy lobster stew			0
fishermen used to eat this at sea because lobster was the only seafood that had no commercial value			0
these days , sadly , the lobster in question may be sourced from @entity210 or @entity211 , so i 'd recommend a short trip along the coast to the bistro @entity216 ( +34 971 35855 ) at @entity217 for the finest fresh fish , at more reasonable prices			2
for a romantic off - season break or a full - on family beach holiday , unspoilt @entity22 is hard to beat			1
@entity222 ( 0843 770 4526 , www.sovereign.com ) offers seven nights at the four - star @entity224 and @entity226 in @entity22 from £ 569 per person half - board , including @entity229 flights , airport lounge access and transfers .			2

@entity22 is smaller and far less developed than its big neighbour @entity58
it owes its lack of *sprawl* to @entity98 , who held a grudge against it
the old city of @entity20 , on its west coast , is one of the main attractions
