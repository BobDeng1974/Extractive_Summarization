it is dressing room scenario that most women can empathize with			0
trying on a pair of jeans in your size - only to find they do n't fit			2
and when you are plus - sized , this is an even more frequent occurrence , according to one @entity10 writer			2
to prove her point , @entity12 - based @entity11 , 23 , tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans			1
above , she found that @entity20 fitted perfectly , with ' soft , sufficiently stretchy ' denim she then captured photos of herself donning the jeans in @entity25 stores , before reviewing the fit			1
in some cases - such as @entity20 and @entity29 ( @entity30 ) - the pants appeared to fit her body shape , often with flattering effects			0
however , in others , ms @entity11 , @entity35 's associate style and beauty editor , was unable to fasten the jeans at all unless ' i lie flat on my back and suck it in more than i ’ve ever sucked it in before '			2
these included @entity45 's plus - size jeans , @entity48 's @entity47 range , @entity50 's brand and @entity51 , said ms @entity11 , who owns size 14 to 20 jeans			1
tight : when trying on some jeans ( including @entity57 's @entity56 range , pictured ) ms @entity11 was unable to fasten the jeans at all unless ' i lie flat on my back and suck it in more than i ’ve ever sucked it in before ' ' dreaded camel toe ' : in reference to @entity65 's @entity64 's @entity56 ( pictured ) , the plus - size writer said : ' digging the relaxed boyfriend style			1
not digging the “ digging ” at the hips and the dreaded camel toe ' meanwhile , some pairs of jeans apparently left her with a more ' pear - shaped ' figure ( including @entity73 's jeans ) , while others resulted in ' dreaded camel - toe ' ( such as @entity65 's @entity51 )			1
and in one case , the @entity77 - @entity10 writer found the jeans were too baggy around the waist			1
writing about women 's clothing sizes for @entity83 , ms @entity11 , who also conducted a plus - size @entity85 experiment in december , said : ' when you ’re plus - size , things get even trickier ' let ’s forget , for a moment , that most brands and stores simply stop producing apparel after a size 12			2
the reality is that a curvier body has , well , more curves			0
comfortable : ms @entity11 , who also conducted a plus - size @entity85 experiment in december , found that @entity98 's plus - size jeans ( pictured ) were ' relatively comfy and soft '			1
but she added : ' i would prefer you in high - waist ' too baggy : with regard to @entity105 's jeans range ( pictured ) , she wrote : ' when stretched at the front , we ’re looking at three unnecessary inches of space			0
but you ’re not baggy anywhere else ! the confusion never stops ' ' and those curves are n’t something you can easily measure - let alone put into jeans			0
' she added that her latest experiment has proved to her - and hopefully , others - that women 's ' obsession with being the " right " size ' is ' nonsensical '			0
' to try to define a “ size ” is equatable to trying to define a “ color "			1
much more energy than it ’s worth , ' said the writer , who admits she is ' not a big denim lover '			2
' sure , i had fun trying to squeeze into pants that were far too small			0
because once you get into it , it is actually fun			0
' but there are other things that require far more better use of head space			0

@entity11 , 23 , tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans in @entity25
she then took photos of herself donning the jeans , before reviewing the fit
while some jeans seemed to fit her figure , other pairs would not fasten up
in one case , the @entity77 - @entity10 *blogger* found jeans were too baggy
' to try to define a “ size ” *...* is much more energy than it ’s worth , ' she said
