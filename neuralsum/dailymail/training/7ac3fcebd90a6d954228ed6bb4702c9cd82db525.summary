' i am deeply flattered by the enthusiastic expressions of support i have received over the last 12 hours , and i am very seriously considering the race			0
i will make an announcement after the due deliberation such an important decision deserves			0
' @entity16 's previous experience in politics extends back to 2010 when he ran for state attorney general and lost to @entity47 @entity46			2
he is best known , however , for prosecuting a police officer who put @entity10 resident @entity3 in a choke hold , contributing to his death			0
a grand jury 's decision not to bring charges against the law enforcement officer earlier this month incited national protests and the ' i ca n't breathe ' movement - @entity3 's now famous last words			0
@entity16 's failure to convince the jury to allow the district attorney 's office to move forward with its case has angered the city 's @entity64 population			2
however , blacks made up just under 10 percent of the borough 's population as of the last census			0
previously a part of the 13th congressional district , @entity10 became part of @entity7 's 11th district after changes to the @entity76 map in 2012 as a result of the decennial census			1
still remaining in the 11th is the southern portion of @entity81			0
the majority @entity10 seat is the only @entity7 congressional district that is represented by a @entity8			1
@entity6 has served as the @entity8 leaning area 's liaison to the @entity76 since 2011			2
despite a federal investigation into business practices he engaged in before he was elected to @entity89 that led to 20 separate charges for federal crimes , @entity6 won reelection in november , beating his @entity94 opponent by seven points			0
the @entity8 lawmaker insisted on his innocence throughout the fall but admitted last tuesday that he helped hide $ 1 million worth of wages and receipts from a @entity102 health foods restaurant he partially owns by preparing a fraudulent tax return			2
prosecutors are asking that he receive 24 to 30 months in prison while his lawyer has argued that 12 to 18 months would be more appropriate			0
last week @entity6 said he would remain in @entity89			0
by monday he had been convinced to step down , allegedly by @entity76 speaker @entity107 , as he awaits a judge 's verdict that will determine his legal fate			0
@entity7 rep. @entity6 , a @entity8 , said on monday that he would vacate his @entity10 congressional seat on jan. 5 after pleading guilty last week to a felony charge for tax evasion			1
@entity7 governor @entity13 must now call a special election to be held within 70 to 80 days of his announcement among the interested @entity94 are @entity10 assemblyman @entity116 , left , and @entity6 ’s predecessor , former congressman @entity117 , right even before @entity6 came clean about about his dirty business dealings , party leaders were considering possible replacements , should it come to that			1
the day after @entity6 was reelected , @entity124 chairman @entity123 suggested that assemblywoman @entity24 could carry the @entity8 torch in a special election			1

it is now up to @entity10 's @entity8 to choose a possible successor to @entity6 , as state law only calls for a general election under the circumstances and no primary			1
outside candidates could still compete in the contest but they would need to obtain 3,500 signatures in a relatively short amount of time in order to have their names printed on the ballot			0
potential @entity8 contenders for the party 's nomination include @entity24 , who told a @entity10 news publication on monday evening that she was ' taking a serious look at the seat , ' and state senator @entity26 , one of @entity6 's competitors in the 2010 @entity8 primary			1
among the interested @entity94 is @entity10 assemblyman @entity116			1
he said monday , ' it 's something i wo n't rule out and will give strong consideration to			0
' @entity6 ’s predecessor , former congressman @entity117 , may also seek to reclaim his old seat			1
@entity117 lost to @entity6 four years ago by three points while in his first term in @entity89			2
after @entity6 's admission of guilt last week he told @entity161 he was neither ' ruling out or ruling in ' a political comeback			2
' it will get serious consideration , ' he said			0
should @entity117 represent his party in the special election , his vote for the @entity166 , also known as @entity166 , will likely be the subject of political attacks from his @entity8 opponent .			1
