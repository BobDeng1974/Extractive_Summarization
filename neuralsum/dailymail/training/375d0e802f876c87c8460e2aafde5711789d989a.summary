even as they grapple with an immigration crisis at the border , @entity1 officials are making plans to act before november 's mid-term elections to grant work permits to potentially millions of immigrants who are in this country illegally , allowing them to stay in the @entity9 without threat of deportation , according to advocates and lawmakers in touch with the administration			1
such a large - scale move on immigration could scramble election - year politics and lead some conservative @entity19 to push for impeachment proceedings against president @entity21 , a prospect @entity1 officials have openly discussed			1
yet there 's little sign that the urgent humanitarian situation in @entity27 , where unaccompanied minors have been showing up by the tens of thousands from @entity29 , has impeded @entity21 from making plans to address some portion of the 11.5 million immigrants now in this country illegally			2
since then he 's asked @entity34 for $ 3.7 billion to deal with the crisis of unaccompanied youths , a request that 's gone unmet even as the @entity1 and the @entity45 scramble to see if they can vote on some solution to the crisis this week before adjourning for their annual august recess			2
meanwhile , @entity1 officials led by @entity51 director @entity50 and @entity1 counsel @entity52 , along with homeland security secretary @entity53 , have been working to chart a plan on executive actions @entity21 could take , hosting frequent meetings with interest groups and listening to recommendations from immigration advocates , law enforcement officials , religious leaders , @entity63 lawmakers and others			1
advocates and lawmakers who were in separate meetings friday said that administration officials are weighing a range of options including reforms to the deportation system and ways to grant relief from deportation to targeted populations in the country , likely by expanding @entity21 's two - year - old directive that granted work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as youths			1
that program , called @entity82 , or @entity82 , has been extended to more than 500,000 immigrants so far			0
advocates would like to see deferred action made available to anyone who would have been eligible for eventual citizenship under a comprehensive immigration bill the @entity45 passed last year , which would be around 9 million people			0
but @entity21 told them in a meeting a month ago to ' right - size ' expectations , even as he pledged to be aggressive in steps he does take			1
that 's led advocates to focus on other populations @entity21 might address , including parents or legal guardians of @entity9 citizen children			1
they account for approximately 3.8 million of illegal immigrants living in the @entity9 , as of 2009 , according to an analysis by @entity102 's @entity101			2
another population of interest is parents or legal guardians of @entity82 recipients - perhaps 500,000 to 1 million people , according to the @entity108			0
' our parents deserve to live without the fear of deportation , ' @entity109 , a 21 - year - old from @entity110 who came to the @entity9 from @entity111 16 years ago , said at a protest outside the @entity1 on monday			2
' it is time for the president to go big and to go bold			0
' activist @entity119 of @entity120 , @entity121 , who is originally from @entity122 , participates in an @entity123 we dream rally in front of the @entity1 today			0
immigration reform activists urged president @entity21 not to deport the parents of @entity130 , children who brought illegally to the @entity9 according to activists and lawmakers , president @entity21 is considering giving amnesty to the parents of children who qualify for his deferred action for @entity136 and illegal immigrants whose children were born in the @entity9 the potentially hundreds of thousands of people who might be eligible for green cards today if current law did n't require them to leave the country for 10 years before applying for one could be is also an area of focus			1
at the same time , the @entity9 @entity145 says it is actively working to determine whether there are steps @entity21 could take by executive action that could help the business community			1
for @entity21 , the political repercussions of broad executive action on immigration could be unpredictable , and extreme			2
@entity19 are warning he could provoke a constitutional crisis			0
' it would be an affront to the people of this country which they will never forgive , it would be a permanent stain on your presidency , ' sen. @entity154 , @entity155 , said on the @entity45 floor monday , while urging language to block such executive action be made part of any legislation to address the border crisis			0
@entity170 chairman @entity169 , @entity171 , announced plans to use an oversight hearing on the @entity175 agency tuesday to raise questions about @entity21 's plans , which he warned could ' worsen the border crisis and encourage many more to come			1
' on the other side , some @entity179 have debated the best timing for @entity21 to take executive action , raising questions as to whether acting before the midterms could hurt vulnerable @entity179 in close races while boosting turnout among the @entity19 base			0
but liberal advocates noted that @entity21 's move on deferred action two years ago gave him a boost heading into his re-election and could help this year with @entity63 voters discouraged over the failure of immigration reform legislation and record - high deportations on @entity21 's watch			1
republicans would be in a position of deciding whether to come out in favor of deporting sympathetic groups , such as parents , and many liberals say impeachment talk would only shore up @entity205 base voters			0
' most democrats will be thrilled ' if @entity21 acts boldly on immigration , said @entity208 , executive director of @entity209 , a leading advocacy group			0
' and @entity19 will keep lurching to the right and cementing their reputation as the anti-immigrant party			0

president @entity21 said late last month that he would act on immigration reform if @entity34 did not
since then @entity21 's advisers have been meeting with lawmakers and activists about possible actions the president could take
@entity21 is expected to make a move before november 's *federal* elections
among the *proposals* : giving work permits to parents of children legally residing in the @entity9
