@entity0 revealed how he was inspired by @entity3 's @entity2 victory at @entity4 after taking the halfway lead in the @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity0 was part of the winning team at @entity10 in 2012 but failed to make the team this year and had to settle for commentating on the event instead on radio			1
the 31 - year - old responded by coming agonisingly close to recording the first 59 in @entity16 history in his next competitive round in the @entity19 , where he finished second to @entity21 's @entity20 in an event reduced to 36 holes by bad weather			1
@entity0 hits his tee - shot on the ninth hole during the second round of the @entity6 one fan jokes with @entity29 in @entity7 , but the @entity30 did n't appear to get the joke former @entity2 star @entity0 , who shot a brilliant 64 on friday , hits an approach at @entity33 a superb 64 at @entity33 on friday ensured those positions were reversed , with @entity29 on 14 under and overnight leader @entity20 13 under after adding a 66 to his opening 65			1
' i felt like i 've been in the zone a couple of times lately and it does n't really happen in such a short period of time like this , ' said @entity0 , who won the @entity44 but struggled to reproduce that form when he tried his luck on the @entity47 last season			2
' so it 's pretty nice when you can get it going like this and i 've been playing quite well for the last couple of months			2
' i 'm comfortable being back here now			0
i 'm quite happy being here and playing the way i am capable of			2
' speaking about being reduced to the role of spectator at @entity4 , the world no 142 added : ' even though i was far out of making that team , i still felt that i was that type of calibre player			1
' when you get to see it like that from the outside , i certainly was missing it			0
i wish i could have been playing in it and it 's almost like you go back the week after and you just keep that intensity that you 've seen at the @entity2 and bring that out in the next tournament			1
' you realise how golf should be played on some of the courses and not be afraid of taking command			0
when you see match play for a week like that , it 's actually quite interesting to see how low you can go and maybe in stroke play sometimes we 're a little bit more playing on the safe side of things			0
' nice birdie ! @entity84 returned to his best form with a superb seven - under - par round of 65 @entity89 's former @entity88 champion plays his second shot on the fifth hole as his caddie ' @entity93 ' looks on @entity94 of @entity95 and his caddie walk towards the green on the fifth hole during the second round @entity20 , who won the @entity100 in april and shot rounds of 63 and 61 to win in @entity102 three weeks ago , looked set to increase his one - shot overnight lead when he birdied four of his first seven holes and picked up another shot on the 11th			1
however , he failed to get up and down from right of the 12th green to drop his first shot of the week and although he birdied the 14th and 15th , the 24 - year - old was unable to catch @entity0			1
fellow @entity21 and hotel room - mate @entity111 was two shots further back on 11 under , with @entity94 , @entity114 and @entity115 all 10 under and @entity116 alone in seventh another shot adrift			2
@entity116 got off to a nightmare start with a bogey on the first and triple - bogey eight on the third , but then carded nine birdies in the last 15 holes to record a 67 in his first tournament since the @entity2			1
' i 've had a really bad neck leading all the way into the @entity2 really , but kind of kept that quiet and kept going , ' said the 43 - year - old , who was subsequently a late withdrawal for the @entity44			2
' and then the body after that week just could n't keep up with it any more			0
' @entity130 was n't to be			0
i literally could not get out of bed for three days			0
it 's just one of those things , i 'm getting a bit older now			0
' @entity84 was two shots behind @entity116 as his own comeback continued , the world no 6 recovering from being four over after four holes to card an opening 72 and adding a superb 65 on friday			2
' it was much needed , ' said @entity141 , who was unbeaten in five matches and the top points scorer in @entity3 's @entity2 triumph at @entity4			1
' the leaderboard lit up today			0
' the guys took advantage of the scoring conditions and basically my seven under was needed to just somewhat keep pace			0
i played well and had the opportunity to go quite a few lower , too			0
