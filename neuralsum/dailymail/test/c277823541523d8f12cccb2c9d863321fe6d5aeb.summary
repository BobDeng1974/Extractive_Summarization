@entity10 , in the country 's south , is believed to be among the three most dangerous of @entity1 's 90 active volcanoes , but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time			1

eruptions occur when magma forces its way to the surface , exploding through weak points in the crust plume : while most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava , many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash which is pushed through the earth 's crust , covering the sky not another one : @entity1 is a sparsely populated region of high volcanic activity			2
in march , volcano @entity125 , about 155 miles to the @entity127 , also erupted in spectacular fashion , sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky he said : ' it sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road , rattling and shaking , guttural rumbling ... we left everything there , grabbed my kid , my dog , got in the car with my wife			2
