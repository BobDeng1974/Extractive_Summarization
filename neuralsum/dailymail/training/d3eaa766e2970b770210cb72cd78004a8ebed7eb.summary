archaeologists have unearthed what they believe to be a vampire burial site in @entity3			1
the so - called ' vampire graves ' contain skeletons which all have an iron rod impaled through their bodies where their heart would have been			1
the discovery , made at the ancient temple of @entity12 , south - east of the @entity3 capital @entity14 , is further evidence that people really did believe that vampires could rise from the dead if they were not buried properly			1
vampire graves : archaeologists have unearthed what they believe to be a vampire burial site in @entity3 @entity23 ? the so - called ' vampire graves ' contain skeletons which all have an iron rod impaled through their bodies where their heart would have been out for the count : scores of people were killed because they were thought to be vampires , similar to witch - hunts elsewhere in @entity33 and @entity34 in the 13th and 14th centuries , many eastern @entity33 held the belief that vampires were real , causing mass hysteria when people suspected someone of being one of the blood - sucking creatures			1
scores of people were killed because they were thought to be vampires , similar to witch - hunts elsewhere in @entity33 and @entity34			0
however it may be possible that some towns had a ritual of hammering a stake into dead people 's hearts to make sure they did not join the undead , even if there was no suspicion of them being a vampire			2
the skeletons were found by ' @entity3 's @entity57 ' , professor @entity58			1
last year his team found a 35 - 40 - year - old male with a metal pole impaled through where his heart would have been at a nearby site			1
before that professor @entity58 had found 700 - year - old corpses ‘ nailed to the ground with iron staples driven into the limbs ’			2
burial ritual : the technique of impaling a stake through the heart was believed to be the best method for killing a vampire hard at work : the skeletons were found by ' @entity3 's @entity57 ' , prof @entity58 , and his team the site : this week 's discoveries are the sixth and seventh vampires dug up in just two years in @entity3 @entity82 , in the film @entity23 , prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of vampire the year before that , a group headed by the professor unearthed another 700 - year - old skeleton of a man pinned down in his earth in a church in the @entity94 town of @entity95			1
this week 's discoveries are the sixth and seventh vampires dug up in just two years in @entity3			1
however , the phenomenon is not just @entity3			2
last year @entity99 archaeologists unearthed four ' vampire graves ' where the bodies had their heads removed and placed between their legs			1
the discoveries near the southern town of @entity106 showed that different towns believed in different methods for killing vampires			2
the belief in vampires was widespread throughout @entity3 and other parts of central @entity33 throughout the @entity113			1
the word vampire is derived from the original slavic term ' opyrb ' or ' opir ' which later appears as ' vipir ' , ' vepir ' , or ' vapir '			0
drunkards , thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires			0
appearing completely normal , they would arrive at a town and live amongst the people often even marrying and fathering children			0
but at night they would wander the countryside in search of blood			0
these types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart			0
one account maintains that a vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or along a country road , and whose corpse is eaten by crows , wolves , or some other such scavengers			0
because such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the blood of anyone who comes by			0
another account states a person who died a violent , unnatural death or whose corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial , can become a vampire			2
in such cases during the first 40 days after burial , the bones turn to gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night - releasing animals from their pens , scattering house hold items , and suffocating people			0
during the first forty days it can be destroyed by a ' @entity170 ' - a professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively devoured by a wolf			0
however if not destroyed in this time period the @entity174 would develop a skeleton and become even more fierce .			0
