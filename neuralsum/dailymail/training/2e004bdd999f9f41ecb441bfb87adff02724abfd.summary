a @entity1 model enthusiast has built a real - life @entity2 - for just £ 7,000			2
businessman @entity4 , 26 , painstakingly put together the two - ton model with four mechanics in a quiet residential workshop in @entity8			1
the remarkable replica is almost identical to @entity11 's wheels in the @entity13 trilogy , with just one crucial difference - it does n't have an engine			0
@entity17 challenge : one of the mechanics puts the finishing touches to 26 - year - old @entity4 's remarkable @entity2 replica			1
the model cost just £ 7,000 to make , though there is one hitch - it does n't have an engine spot the difference : the real - life @entity2 used in the @entity13 films - which cost considerably more instead the enthusiasts have had to move their creation about using a professional scrapyard hoist			0
the five friends put together the model at a workshop in the @entity36 district , where photos of the creation alongside cyclists and passers - by quickly went viral online			2
they saved money at every turn , spending just 70,000 yuan ( £ 7,100 ) and hand - polishing the bodywork to save cash			1
with extensive experience in prop design and talent in cutting and soldering , they made the whole model from 10 tons of scrap metal in two months			1
they have now made a series of the cars , @entity4 said			2
' we 've built a dozen @entity11 's cars , ' he added			0
' two of them are in @entity8 , while the rest are on display in other parts of the country			0
' @entity11 returns ? the model turned heads among residents in the rural @entity36 district of @entity8 the creators saved money at every turn , spending just 70,000 yuan ( £ 7,100 ) and hand - polishing the car police officer @entity73 said : ' it is quite amazing - not the sort of vehicle you want to give a ticket to ' @entity79 : the futuristic model cut an unusual figure ' parked ' next to normal cars in residential @entity8 huge : the low - slung car is more than 10ft wide with rear wheels almost half as tall as a grown person @entity73 , a police officer who took photos of the car , said : ' we have had a lot of enquiries , but i hate to disappoint @entity93 vehicle is actually a life - size model of @entity11 's futuristic car			1
' it is quite amazing though - not the sort of vehicle you want to give a ticket to			0
' the low - slung car is more than 10ft wide with rear wheels almost half as tall as a grown person			1
their model is almost a hundred times cheaper than a fully - functioning ' @entity2 which went on sale earlier this year			0
just one of five replicas built , it featured a 5.7 - litre v8 engine and 44 - inch tyres and is completely street legal			0
that 's more than can be said for @entity4 's model - and there 's one other hitch , too			2
for copyright reasons his car is not a @entity2 , nor has it ever been called one			0
labour of love : the enthusiasts spend two months putting together the model with 10 tones of scrap metal helpless : because the car has no engine , they had to lift it off the ground using a scrapyard hoist just working on my car : a mechanic makes the finishing touches to spare parts on the £ 7,000 @entity2 model : @entity4 said he had made a number of the replicas and they had gone on show in @entity8 batmobile in action : the tumbling vehicle was a major feature of films including @entity143 ( pictured )			1

@entity4 , 26 , painstakingly made two - ton model in a district of @entity8
he and four mechanics used scrap metal and hand - polished it to save cash
it is more than 10ft wide and its huge rear wheels are around *3ft* across
