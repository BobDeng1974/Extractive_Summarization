by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 07:01 est , 1 january 2013 these two police officers were obviously taking frontline policing very seriously as they were caught by a @entity4 car carrying out investigations crammed into a phonebox			1
the @entity8 police officers were captured on camera examining a red phone box in the upper - class village of @entity12 , in @entity8 whatever crime they were investigating was clearly worth the attention as both officers stand inside the box while closely looking at the phone on the receiver			1
' @entity20 ' ello ' ello : the two police officers were captured cramming into the phonebox by the @entity4 camera inquiry : the two officers can be seen to squeeze into the phonebox in the sleepy village of @entity12 but their hard work and diligence is clearly being rewarded - the village is one of the most crime free areas in the country and did not record a single incident for the entire month of november			1
one local said : ' perhaps the coppers were so desperate for something to do they made a 999 call themselves to boost their numbers			0
' it is unfortunate both officers were pictured crammed into the tiny phone box			2
' hardly a hotspot for crime , the village is better known as having one of the largest village greens in the country			0
it is also the site of two roman villas			0
in the years since the @entity4 fleet began trawling more than five million miles across the planet they have collected a range of bizarre and unexpected images , including a tiger walking across a car park and a range of fancy dress costumes in bizarre situations			0
job well done : the village is one of the most crime - free in the country and did not record a single incident in november			2
