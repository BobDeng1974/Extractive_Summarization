@entity0 is normally a happy time when families enjoy spending the festive season together , while children impatiently await a visit from @entity5 and the presents he brings			1
but these online pictures show that not all children share a love of jolly old @entity5			1
in fact , some are actively terrified of him , as demonstrated by these funny snaps posted by parents , presumably seeking to share their pain and get a modicum of revenge on their miserable offspring			1
but not these sobbing youngsters , who were driven to rivers of tears , clenched fists and ear - splitting screeching as they meet the kindly old @entity0			0
in most of the pictures @entity5 gamely smiles for the camera despite the squirming , scared youngster , but in many the viewer will see a resigned hint of the @entity0 blues behind the fake beard and grandfatherly specs			2
hopefully their unfounded fears about @entity5 will have disappeared by @entity60 and they will remember to leave him a nice mince pie and a glass of milk			0
@entity5 's little yelpers : even holding hands with @entity0 ca n't placate these scared little boys the @entity68 : these smiling @entity69 can not cheer a girl smartly dressed for the season and a wailing little boy brighten up : this little one 's mood is a stark contrast to his colourful jumper			0
parents have shared their hilarious @entity0 photos online			0

online snaps show children utterly *dismayed* by a festive visit to @entity5
parents posting images of *unruly* , crying youngsters
