by @entity0 driven by exceptionally warm ocean waters , @entity2 smashed a record for heat in may and is likely to keep on breaking high temperature marks , experts say			1
the @entity7 monday said may 's average temperature on @entity2 of 59.93 degrees @entity9 ( 15.54 degrees @entity10 ) beat the old record set four years ago			1
however , @entity12 is having a record hot first five months of the year , a full 5 degrees above normal			1
the @entity7 monday said may 's average temperature on @entity2 of 59.93 degrees @entity9 ( 15.54 degrees @entity10 ) beat the old record set four years ago			1
@entity13 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity19 in the central and eastern @entity20 becomes hotter than usual			2
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity23 ( approximately 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			1
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity20 and globally			0
strong @entity13 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			2
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity39 is the climatological counterpart to @entity13			0
@entity39 refers to periods when sea - surface temperatures around the @entity19 are cooler than normal			2
this has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere			0
may was especially hot in parts of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , while the @entity57 was not close to a record , just 1 degree warmer than the 20th century average			1
in april , the globe tied the 2010 record for that month			2
records go back to 1880			0
@entity65 climate scientist @entity64 and other experts say there 's a good chance global heat records will keep falling , especially next year because an @entity13 weather event is brewing on top of man - made global warming			0
an @entity13 is a warming of the eastern tropical @entity20 that alters climate worldwide and usually spikes global temperatures			0
ocean temperatures in may also set a record for the month			1
but an @entity13 is n't considered in effect till the warm water changes the air and that has n't happened yet , @entity7 said			0
with the @entity13 on top of higher temperatures from heat - trapping greenhouse gases , ' we will see temperature records fall all over the world , ' wrote @entity90 climate scientist @entity89 in an email a mahout and his elephant heading towards the @entity94 on a hot day in @entity95 : large regions across north @entity97 have been experiencing a heat wave for days			2
may was 1.33 degrees ( 0.74 degrees @entity10 ) warmer than the 20th century world average			1
the last month that was cooler than normal was february 1985 , marking 351 hotter than average months in a row			1
this possibly could quiet people claiming global warming has stopped , but more importantly it ' should remind everyone that global warming is a long - term trend , ' @entity104 climate scientist @entity102 said			0
setting or tying monthly global heat records has happened frequently in recent years			0
the last global monthly cold record was set in december 1916			2
@entity114 , which is march through may , was the second warmest on record globally , behind only 2010			0
@entity117 , 3 , of @entity118 , cooling - off in a fountain at @entity121 in downtown @entity118			0
@entity57 : driven by record warm ocean waters , may 's average temperature on @entity2 of 59.93 degrees @entity9 beat the old record set in 2010 .			1

average temperature on @entity2 of 59.93 degrees @entity9 ( 15.54 degrees @entity10 )
beat the old record set four years ago
@entity12 recorded record hot first five months 5 degrees above normal
