by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:21 est , 21 february 2014 ever since his wife passed away two years ago , @entity3 has tended to her grave , regularly leaving pots of flowers in tribute			1
now the 85 - year - old former insurance broker has been told that this ritual must stop			0
and you can probably guess why			0
yes , the local council has decreed that grieving relatives can not leave flowers on graves at the cemetery because of health and safety fears			1
@entity3 , 85 , has been told he can not leave flowers at his wife 's grave because of health and safety officials said they put the rules in place several years ago after a cemetery worker cut his knee on a piece of broken pot. and they claim there have been complaints that tributes have blown away making the area untidy			1
but that did little to ease the distress caused to mr @entity3 , who received a letter from @entity39 council in @entity40 on the second anniversary of his wife @entity44 ’s death			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ it was a complete bombshell when this letter arrived			0
i have never been so upset by anything			0
health and safety just seems to be an issue for everything these days			1
‘ when you go to a cemetery to stand by the grave of a loved one , putting a few flowers there is a great mark of respect and love			2
’ the letter sent to mr @entity3 and other families stated flowers could only be left on graves of those who have been cremated if the memorial slabs have a vase built into them			2
mr @entity3 received a letter from @entity39 council on the second anniversary of the death of his wife , @entity44 ( pictured in the 1950s ) however , relatives who tend to larger plots of those who have not been cremated are allowed to leave floral tributes			1
mr @entity3 , a former parish councillor who was married for nearly 60 years , said : ‘ it is grossly unfair that the rule only applies to plots where ashes are buried and not normal graves			2
how can they produce such a rule , putting those of us whose relatives were cremated at a huge disadvantage ? i can not believe any town councillor could make such a distinction			2
‘ i was not aware of the rules when my wife was cremated			2
i normally read everything i get , but i do n’t recall getting a leaflet or anything			0
‘ i did n’t get a tablet with a vase inserted in it because i did n’t think they looked as nice from an aesthetic point of view			0
‘ i have put a plastic pot containing flowers on there every month or so without any problem and none of the pots have ever blown over even in quite a strong wind			1
’ mr @entity3 said the council ’s letter stated that unauthorised pots of flowers would be removed from the cemetery from april			1
but he is hoping councillors will have a change of heart and relax the rules at their next meeting			2
yesterday council clerk @entity115 said : ‘ these rules and regulations have been in place for years and years			1
the reason is to make the maintenance of the cemetery easier			0
we had an accident up there when a member of staff knelt down to do some work and cut his knee on broken glass from a vase			1
‘ the rules apply to everyone and we just felt it was time to remind people about them			0
we are trying to be as helpful as we can and if there are special cases , we will work with people to find a solution			0
mr @entity3 said the council 's letter stated that unauthorised pots of flowers would be removed from the cemetery from april ‘ we have contacted all relatives to remind them of the rules			1
first of all , we telephoned them if we had numbers for them , then we put out a press release and we followed it up by writing to them			0
if any families have concerns they should phone the town council to discuss matters and if necessary make an appointment to meet to discuss it further			0
’ mr @entity3 and his wife married in 1954 and went on to have three children and three grandchildren			0
they moved to their favourite holiday destination of @entity40 after they retired 25 years ago			1
mrs @entity155 died aged 81 in january 2012 .			0
