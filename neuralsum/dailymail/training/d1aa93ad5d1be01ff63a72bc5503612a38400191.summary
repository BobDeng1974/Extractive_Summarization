polar ice is melting quicker than previously thought and threatening to raise global sea levels by a couple of centimetres - with disastrous effect , scientists have warned			1
the dramatic changes could increase flooding on small tropical islands and leave penguins starving			1
and professor @entity10 from the @entity11 said it was ' probably ' due to global warming			1
this could raise sea levels by a few centimetres , flooding islands and leaving penguins starving ( stock image shown )			1
and one researcher says the effect was ' probably ' due to global warming the new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of @entity17 have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years , from 0.8 to 1.2 ° c ( 33.4 to @entity32 )			1
as a result the ice caps of the region are melting quicker than ever before and sea levels are rising			1
professor @entity10 , from the @entity11 , said : ' more ice is melting and that would lead to more flooding in our country in the immediate future			1
an @entity44 satellite recently spotted an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in @entity17			1
while rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already thought to be a consequence of manmade climate change , the @entity49 satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest			1
the results show that the thinning ice sheet from november 2009 to june 2012 caused local variations in gravity , measured by the satellite			0
the @entity49 satellite burned up in @entity62 's atmosphere as planned in november 2013 after four years in orbit			2
during its mission it measured @entity62 's gravity in unprecedented detail , detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface			0
' it means we need to think more about our flood defences			0
' we need to account for these sea level rises and make sure they are big enough			2
' it could also be particularly bad for some of the tropical islands			2
they are some of the poorest populations in the world and they could just disappear			0
' we are forecasting that the sea level might rise by a couple of centimetres which would be enough to have a big impact			2
' professor @entity87 , of the university 's @entity88 , added : ' it could also affect the krill population which might migrate elsewhere if the water is too warm			0
' they are the base of the food chain and are eaten by the penguins , the seals and the whales			2
it would have a knock on effect for wildlife in the region			0
' i do n't know if there is anything the human population can do but it is something we need to take account of			0
' she added : ' we ca n’t say it is global warming , rather than part of a natural cycle			1
but i suspect it probably is			0
' it is among the most thorough looks at the waters in the area to date , and fits in with climate change due to anthropogenic sources			2
' the new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of @entity17 ( stock image shown ) have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years , from 0.8 to @entity127 ( 33.4 to @entity32 ) the new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of @entity17 ( stock image shown ) have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years , from 0.8 to @entity127 ( 33.4 to @entity32 ) scientists from the @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 analysed data from oceanographic records dating back to 1960			1
it revealed temperatures in the @entity139 and the @entity140 had been rising for the past 50 years			1
they also found the water was less salty which has accelerated the melting and sliding of glaciers in the region			0
it also reveals that other @entity148 areas could experience melting for the first time and there is no indication that this trend will reverse			0
professor @entity87 said : ' the @entity148 ice sheet is a giant water reservoir			0
' the ice cap on the southern continent is on average 2,100 metres [ 6,900 feet ] thick and contains about 70 per cent of the world 's fresh water			0
' if this ice mass were to melt completely , it could raise the global sea level by 60 metres [ 195 feet ]			1
' that 's not going to happen , but it gives you an idea of how much water is stored there			0
' accelerated glacial melting in this area has been observed for some time , causing a major contribution to rising sea levels worldwide			1
' the research was funded by the @entity131 's @entity174			0
the study , entitled ' multidecadal warming of @entity148 waters ' , is being published in the journal @entity179 .			2

waters around glaciers in @entity17 are warmer than thought
claim was made by researchers led by the @entity11
seas in @entity17 have become half a degree warmer in 50 years , according to the researchers
this could raise sea levels by a few centimetres , flooding islands and leaving penguins starving
and one researcher says the effect was ' probably ' due to global warming
