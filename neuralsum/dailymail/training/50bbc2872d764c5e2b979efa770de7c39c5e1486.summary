wannabe diplomat : newly - released emails give more detail on how @entity4 socialite @entity3 wormed her way into military society newly - released emails shed light on the ambitious @entity4 socialite who inadvertently exposed @entity10 ' affair with his biographer @entity11 , which ended his storied career in one of the biggest military scandals of the past decade			1
more than two hundred pages of emails between @entity3 and two senior military officials were recently obtained by the @entity19 , two years after the newspaper filed a @entity22 request to see them			1
the emails between @entity3 , a married mother of three and medical researcher , show how she flattered former marine general @entity25 , then commander to all military forces in the @entity28 , and his deputy , vice admiral @entity29 , to win honorary titles that she treated as if they were a real - life diplomatic job			1
the emails show no inappropriate behavior between @entity3 and the officials , though both @entity25 and @entity29 retired from the military within a year of the scandal			1
the emails , strewn with exclamation marks and capitalized letters for flair , @entity3 praises @entity25 and @entity29 for their diplomatic prowess			2
in one email sent to @entity25 after a party in 2012 , @entity44 wrote : ' everyone thinks you 're a @entity49 ! we agreed how amazing it must be that you 're single - handedly re-writing history			2
' in a later response , @entity52 returned the compliment by telling @entity3 : ' i wish that we could clone a couple thousand of you , but the land is likely not ready for that big an impact			2
' the 39 - year - old is currently in the middle of a lawsuit against the @entity63 and @entity64 , agencies she claims violated her privacy by revealing her identity in the midst of the embarrassing 2012 scandal involving @entity70 , then @entity71 director			1
that year , @entity3 started receiving emails from an unknown account , accusing her of having an affair with @entity10			1
when the emails turned threatening towards herself and her family , she filed a complaint with the @entity63			0
the @entity63 discovered that the emails had originated from @entity11 , @entity10 ' biographer , and it was revealed that the two were having an extramarital affair and that @entity11 feared @entity3 was some sort of romantic rival			1
that revelation caused gen @entity10 to quit his position in disgrace , and for @entity90 general @entity89 to retire early			1
@entity89 became caught up in the scandal since he was found to have exchanged an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 emails with @entity3 , though some say the figure was exaggerated and closer to 300 messages			1
he was later cleared of any wrongdoing and is currently working as @entity97 for the @entity98 to counter @entity99 ( @entity99 )			0
@entity3 has consistently denied having a relationship with @entity10 , or anyone else , and no evidence has ever been revealed implicating herself of any inappropriate relationship with the former four - star general			1
the emails just published in the @entity19 also hold no evidence of inappropriate behavior between @entity3 and her military chums			1
friends : @entity3 , 39 , is best known for inadvertantly exposing an extramarital affair between general @entity10 and his biographer @entity11			1
@entity3 and @entity10 pictured attending an event above exposed : the affair between @entity10 and @entity11 was exposed when @entity3 filed a complaint to the @entity63 after receiving threatening messages			1
they emails were ultimately traced back to @entity118 who apparently saw @entity3 as a romantic rival , though both @entity10 and @entity3 have fiercely denied any inappropriate relationship they do however , paint a picture of how she set out to make a name for herself among the upper echelons of the military community in @entity127 , and how she grew over confident when she was awarded honorary diplomatic titles just for hosting parties			1
' the latest set of e-mails made public by the government simply confirms that @entity3 is and was a talented , civic - minded woman doing productive work as honorary ambassador to @entity136 in @entity4 and as honorary consul for the @entity138 , ' her attorney @entity139 said in a statement to the @entity19			1
' nonetheless , continued unauthorized government release of @entity3 's emails exposes them to further unjustified embarrassment and injury			2
' @entity3 and her husband @entity146 started to familiarize themselves with the military community in @entity4 by hosting parties for officials at their mansion near @entity152 , home to @entity136			1
after befriending @entity25 and his deputy vice admiral @entity29 , @entity3 practically begged to be named the honorary ambassador to @entity136			2
in one email to @entity29 on january 12 , 2012 , @entity3 wrote : ' @entity154 …			2
. did you and @entity156 finally decide to make me your " official " @entity136 ambassador ? ? ? ? ? please ! please ! please ! i always wanted to be an ambassador , since i was made to be a ‘ catalyst ’ — that helps build or facilitate foreign relations			0
' military chums : the @entity19 received more than 200 pages of emails between @entity3 and former marine gen @entity25 ( left ) and his deputy vice adm @entity29 ( right ) , two years after the newspaper filed a @entity166 request to see them ' we 'll have to put you through the vetting process and interviews to ensure you have the right attributes ! ' @entity29 replied			1
@entity3 's efforts were not in vain as she was named the @entity136 and @entity175 in a ceremony just three months later			2
gen @entity25 was in @entity177 at the time , so could n't attend the april 19 ceremony			0
but @entity3 made sure to write him in detail about the event and how seriously she took the responsibilities of the title			2
' i gave my commitment			0
as the ambassador , to make it my priority to advance global trust , international exchange , and camaraderie within the command			0
' but most importantly i thanked gen @entity25 for his priceless support and glorius leadership			0
i said , without him , this would not be a reality ! ' @entity29 also spoke — really flattering words about ‘ madame ambassador ’ he explained how they decided to designate this new position — and why the @entity136 unilaterally chose me			0
: ) ( which was very humbling to hear in front of a million guys ) ' during the course of her brief time in the good graces of military society , @entity3 was also named honorary consul to @entity138			1
the appointment came out of the blue , since she knew little about the country , but that did n't prevent her from taking the position in stride			0
in an email to gen @entity25 , informing him of the position , she wrote : ' @entity216 ! ! ! honorary consul general			2
i ’m soooooo excited about the humbling honor			0
it ’s ironic that i get the request from the state of @entity138 — which is not my expertise			0
however as a lover of international politics / foreign affairs , i do find the @entity226 quite interesting			0
( i ’m a lover of conflict problem solving , and have a keen sense of seeking opportunities in chaos			0
) ' it has also been revealed that @entity3 was invited to visit @entity232 by the @entity234 parliament , though it 's unclear why they chose to honor her			2
in an email to an unidentified @entity239 official on august 27 , @entity3 said she was ' honored ' by the invitation and ' would be humbled to serve the request to foster , promote and proliferate future relations and agreements with the @entity244			0
' she added that commander @entity89 supported the trip , and copied him on the email			0
@entity3 's lawyer would not say if she actually followed through with the visit			0
the longer she maintained these relationships , the more confident @entity3 became with her honorary titles			1
the emails show a darker side to the socialite , in one instance sending a dramatic message to @entity29 after learning that she would n't be the only honored guest to attend a @entity259 ceremony			1
though thick and thin : @entity3 remains married to her husband @entity146 , and the couple live in @entity4 with their three children while pursuing a lawsuit against the @entity266 government for violating their privacy ' @entity269 , what is this all about ? ? ? you never informed me of ‘ 3 ’ other honorary ambassadors ? ? ? ? ? ? ' when @entity274 replied that he would look into the matter , @entity3 responded : ' please call			1
and make it very clear that you are not supporting this			0
these @entity280 guys manipulate passive behavior			0
clearly , i ’m offended , and not standing up for this			0
please address this today , and kill this for once and for all			0
' when @entity10 ' affair was revealed in november 2012 , @entity3 lost her favor in the military community and the honorary titles she worked to hard to win			1
but she has gained some success in her privacy lawsuit			0
the federal government 's request to throw out the case was recently overruled by a judge and the case has been cleared to continue in @entity297 in @entity298 , @entity298 meanwhile the @entity299 is still deciding whether to bring up charges against @entity10 for allegedly leaking classified material to his mistress and biographer @entity304			2
he has continually denied passing secret information .			0

@entity3 inadvertently exposed an affair between gen @entity10 and his biographer @entity11 in 2012
that scandal led @entity10 to quit his job as @entity71 director in disgrace
before that , @entity3 wriggled her way into military society by hosting parties at her @entity4 mansion with *surgeon* husband @entity146
newly released emails show how she befriended high - ranking military officials to gain honorary titles
