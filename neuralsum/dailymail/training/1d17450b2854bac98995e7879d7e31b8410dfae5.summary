by @entity1 reporter published : 11:21 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 11:28 est , 6 september 2012 residents have complained about new lampposts they say look like @entity4 workmen have been forced to abandon fitting new eco-friendly lampposts on a leafy estate because householders say they look like flying saucers			1
furious residents are adamant the new lamps are alien to the landscape			1
they insist they are ' not in keeping with the historic character ' of the pretty 22 - acre conservation site			0
they were outraged when pavements outside their £ 250,000 homes in @entity19 's @entity18 were dug - up to make way for the modern aluminium street furniture			0
the new environmentally - friendly lights were supposed to cut light pollution			1
but angry locals of the 100 - year - old estate complained to @entity26 that they did not fit the area 's image			1
now contractors working for the authority have been forced to halt work on the streets because of the controversy			2
the town hall now faces finding extra cash to fund so - called ' heritage - style ' lamps for the estate - which has always been adorned with cast iron street signs and old - fashioned swan - necked street lamps			1
former @entity19 city councillor @entity41 lives in the area			0
the 59 - year - old claimed work started last week without warning			2
he said : ' a hole appeared in the footpath outside my house , about six feet from my front window , where there had not been a lamppost before			0
' they started work a week before they said they were going to so we were shocked			2
' when we complained , we discovered the contractors working for the council do a rather nice looking lamppost for conservation areas , so we have asked for them			2
' @entity63 was among the streets where work was to begin installing the lampposts that were alien to the estate work was about to start installing posts outside the home of @entity71 old - fashioned lighting will now be fitted to appease the angry residents of @entity18 's pretty streets even though the new ones ' were supposed to be terribly efficient and green ' @entity41 thought it ' best to have the heritage ones			1
' ' we ’ve got them to have a temporary stop but the city council might have to find some extra money to install the heritage lampposts , ' he said			1
the hole outside @entity41 's home was ready for the new lighting until locals expressed their unhappiness about the shiny new lighting			0
another disgruntled resident was @entity91			0
the 51 - year - old said : ' i could n’t believe it when they said they were going to install these monstrosities in our area			2
' they look like flying saucers or something from one of those sci - fi films			0
they are an absolute eyesore			0
' it does n’t fit in with the historic feel of the area and it made a lot of the residents feel very angry			0
' the leafy estate was awarded conservation area status in 2009 , meaning historic features are protected			0
as a result of the complaints @entity117 - contracted to do the council ’s highways work for 25 years - has halted the installation and ordered old fashioned lampposts instead			1
an @entity117 spokeswoman admitted they will cost the council @entity125 said : ' residents were concerned that , although their roads are listed as a conservation area , they had not had the opportunity to request an upgrade to heritage - style streetlights			1
' as a consequence of the concerns raised , the lighting improvement works in the area have been put on hold in order that a review can be undertaken			0
' normally in a conservation area we would look if they wanted heritage lights but that did n’t happen this time for some reason			1
' it ’s a case of talking to the residents and finding out what they want and finding a way forward that pleases everyone			0
' there ’s an extra cost to the heritage lights and councillors will need to find the funding from their constituency committee			1

householders left furious as they complain new lampposts look like @entity4
residents left shocked when council contractors started digging up streets
town hall must now find extra cash to fund old - fashioned lights in the area
contractor admits it did *n't* ask locals if they wanted the *unwelcome* lights
