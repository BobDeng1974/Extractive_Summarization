sen. @entity0 and gov. @entity1 placed first and second in a straw poll held during this weekend 's @entity3 , but dr. @entity4 may have stolen the show without being a candidate for anything			1
he emerged in third place with 11 per cent support , tied with @entity11 gov. @entity10 and former sen. @entity12			1
@entity0 led them by less than four points , with 14.7 per cent support			1
@entity1 polled 13 per cent			1
a ' draft committee ' intent on sparking @entity4 to run for the @entity18 in 2016 raised more than $ 2.8 million in its first six months of existence			1
that 's more than double what the ' @entity23 ' group raised in its initial half - year , even though @entity25 's candidacy seems far more assured than @entity4 's			1
dr. @entity4 , professor emeritus at the @entity27 , has become a quiet force in the 2016 @entity30 presidential race without announcing a thing the group angling to persuade @entity4 to make a @entity18 run brought activists to support him at @entity35 , near @entity36 , in large numbers , but fared even better in a smaller @entity39 setting without the extra muscle why they fight : @entity41 @entity30 mocked their favorite @entity43 villains during the two - day conference in @entity45 , @entity39 the top two poll slots at the smallish event that concluded saturday in @entity45 , @entity39 mirrored those of a statewide @entity50 / @entity49 poll released on march 6			1
@entity1 and @entity0 were tied with 12 per cent support each in that earlier poll , a tiny level of backing that shows how wide open the 2016 @entity30 presidential nomination race is			1
the top vote - getter , in reality , was ' undecided			2
' @entity59 , by contrast , typically dominates the @entity43 ' prospective 2016 field , leading all comers by 40 points or more			2
@entity4 was not included on the @entity65 pollsters ' list			2
he polled 9 per cent – good enough for another third - place finish – in a straw poll at this month 's @entity35			1
but @entity0 dominated and won for the second straight year , with a 31 per cent showing			2
@entity35 is a a much larger gathering dominated by insurgent tea party - aligned activists , which included remarks from @entity4			1
but unlike the hyper - conservative event , which banned @entity1 last year over his embrace of @entity76 following super storm @entity77 , just 29 per cent of the @entity45 event 's attendees said they identified with the 5 - year - old right - wing tea party movement			1
polling few enough votes to be lumped into the catch - all ' other ' category was @entity87 morning show host and former congressman @entity85 , whose presidential trial balloons have largely popped amid @entity30 ' concerns about his 2012 change of heart on gun control			0
@entity85 spoke saturday morning and had little to show for it but a few book sales			0
@entity4 made big waves despite being nearly a continent away in @entity97 , speaking to a crowd of 1,300 at the @entity99 in an event hosted by a @entity102 school			2
@entity104 sen. @entity0 ( @entity105 ) and @entity107 gov. @entity1 ( r ) placed # 1 and # 2 in the @entity110 straw poll , with a trip including @entity4 nipping at their heels the results : @entity0 and @entity1 on top , @entity4 in a surprising tie for third , and @entity85 nowhere to be found red meat : confernce attendees in @entity39 were treated to a seemingly endless supply of political fire - stoking materials and anti-obama one - liners ' i think the biggest issue facing us today is we 've abandoned @entity127 , ' he said there friday night			1
' i think the second biggest problem is we 've become selfish			0
nobody got that upset about [ @entity132 ] @entity131			0
nobody got that upset about @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , ' he went on , rattling off a series of president @entity76 's most confidence - rattling scandals			0
' but they got upset about @entity141 because that affected them personally			0
' unconventional warfare : 2,000 hotel guests attending the @entity35 convention this month received key cards featuring @entity4 's face and the draft - friendly ' @entity149 ! ' sogan in what sounded like the beginnings of a campaign speech , @entity4 directly attacked @entity43 messaging			1
' they say there 's a war on women - give me a break ! - racial wars , age wars , income wars , wherever they can drive a wedge into any crack , ' @entity4 said			1
' it 's much easier to manipulate small groups than it is a whole population			0
' ' what is going to be necessary is we the people of the @entity173 have to wake up and realize we are being manipulated and we are not each other 's enemies			2
those enemies are the people who are trying to manipulate us			0
we need to learn how to identify them			0
in cases where they are public officials we need to vote them out of office			0
' @entity182 , campaign director with the @entity183 @entity4 for president @entity184 , told @entity186 that his pick ' is the only guy who can broaden the base of the @entity30 by getting a bunch more minority votes			2
... he 's the only guy who can heal the country			0
' @entity4 has become a lightning rod in the past year , beginning in early 2013 when he delivered health care - related remarks at a @entity197 – with president @entity76 just feet away on the dais – that were openly hostile to the @entity141 program			1
at the prayer breakfast , @entity4 warned about the historical lessons of civilizations that ' destroyed themselves from within			2
they destroyed themselves , ' he said			0
' and if you do n't think that can happen to @entity173 , you get out your books and you start reading			1
' partly because of that speech , @entity212 withdrew his invitation to speak at its 2013 commencement exercises			0
@entity4 is professor emeritus at the university 's famed medical school			2
no mistaking it : the @entity30 has to respond to the @entity76 phenomenon by drafting a candidate who can boost @entity30 minority voting , says @entity4 ' draft ' leader @entity182 @entity182 said @entity4 does n't coordinate messaging or scheduling with his organization			1
but as the renowned surgeon 's name gains national traction , he has n't discouraged the ' draft ' movement either			1
the result , he said , is a maybe - candidacy with serious heft			0
' he came out very close to where @entity1 was , and the event was in his back yard , run by his guys , ' @entity182 explained			1
@entity241 , a former @entity1 campaign aide , is now executive director of the @entity184 , which put on the @entity45 event			2
the poll of 223 attendees , which does not necessarily scientifically represent @entity30 voters , was conducted by @entity247			0
participants included 65 - percent men			0
a separate 68 per cent were residents of @entity39 , which will hold the nation 's first presidential primary elections			0
' what this survey tells is that is that no one candidate has really separated themselves from the potential field in 2016 , ' said @entity247 vice president @entity260			0
' at this point , the nomination is completely up - for - grabs and of the would - be contenders , no one can be ruled out just yet			0
' enthusiasm : ' run , @entity269 , @entity270 ' mini-banners were available at @entity35 and the @entity39 event			0

@entity4 , a conservative @entity273 - @entity173 *neurosurgeon* , is n't a candidate for any office
but a national ' draft committee ' is raising money and trying to persuade him to run for the @entity18
party favorites @entity0 and @entity1 ran # 1 and # 2 in modest straw poll held during the @entity3
@entity4 tied for third with gov. @entity10 and former sen. @entity12 , less than 4 percentage points behind the leaders
