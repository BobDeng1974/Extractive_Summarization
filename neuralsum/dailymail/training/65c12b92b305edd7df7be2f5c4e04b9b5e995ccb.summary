for just under five minutes on saturday , @entity1 ’s supporters found their voice			1
with @entity6 lock @entity5 in the sin bin , @entity4 ’s side finally gave the 82,125 fans inside @entity10 hope with two tries to level the score at 20 - 20			1
@entity13 echoed around the rain - soaked old stadium but they had barely got through the first verse before it all went flat again			0
just as the power failed before the match , the lights went out on @entity1 ’s momentarily sparky performance			2
with @entity5 still off , the hulking @entity22 muscled his way over in the right - hand corner and @entity6 never looked back			1
if the alarm bells were ringing following defeat to the @entity100 , the sirens are screaming from the @entity10 rooftops after this loss			2
five defeats in succession , albeit against the best two sides in the world , is @entity1 ’s worst run since 2006			2
and as the countdown to the @entity110 continues , there is no sign of significant improvement			0
for the second week running , an opposition @entity113 — this time @entity22 — won the man - of - the - match award , leaving more questions over @entity1 captain @entity27 ’s suitability for the openside role			1
for the second week running , @entity1 were second best at the breakdown			1
for the second week running , @entity44 was unable to spark his back line			1
for the second week running , the scoreboard told a false story			1
@entity1 created next to nothing when @entity6 had a full complement on the field			1
on the few occasions they did , they bombed their chances			0
the first 15 minutes were truly dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery , but far from treacherous , handling conditions against a side who tackled fiercely , sat back and waited for their chances to come			1
before @entity1 knew it , they were 10 - 0 down and they were lucky to reach half time at 13 - 6			1
that became 20 - 6 just after the break when @entity70 crossed for a brilliantly worked try before @entity1 briefly rallied with @entity5 in the bin			1
but with momentum swinging , @entity22 and co wrestled control back and closed out the game			0
@entity4 said : ‘ we got some good field position in the second half and took those chances well			0
in the first half we could have been a bit smarter in those conditions			2
it was one of those days when territory was going to be important and in the first half @entity6 benefited from our errors			2
@entity6 centre @entity39 runs away for the first try of the match after intercepting the pass of @entity158 @entity1 's @entity159 takes on @entity6 's @entity69 as the centre makes his full international debut @entity6 ' forwards engulf @entity1 's @entity52 after he takes the ball from a lineout @entity44 adds two points after the try of @entity48 to make his tally two penalties and two conversions before being replaced a break from @entity1 full back @entity40 is halted by try - scorer @entity39 @entity6 celebrate @entity70 's first international try in his first start for the @entity6 in the first minute of the second half @entity1 83 ( 2 ) 107 388 5 1 28 14 13 4/4 19/20 80/89 58 % 60 % tackles ( missed ) carries metres clean breaks offloads kicks ( hand ) turnovers pens against scrums won lineouts won @entity181 possession territory @entity184 123 ( 20 ) 77 217 2 4 34 14 15 3/3 13/13 60/63 42 40 ‘ but we ’re not going to sit here feeling sorry for ourselves because i believe in the coaches , i believe in the players and i believe in what we ’re doing			1
’ no one player should not carry the can for another collectively poor display but @entity194 @entity52 will not seek out the highlights reel of this match with any relish			2
substituted after 43 minutes , the young @entity198 can rarely have produced a more error - strewn display			0
@entity58 will surely start next week if the strike - threatened clash with @entity201 goes ahead			1
almost as soon as @entity52 was replaced by @entity58 , @entity1 found some bite			1
two tries in three minutes from the industrious @entity48 and then from @entity58 himself gave @entity1 ’s fans hope			1
but like so many times under @entity4 ’s reign , the home side flattered to deceive , lacking the nous to beat one of the @entity211 ’s big three			0
just as @entity100 did last week , @entity6 gripped this game at precisely the right time			2
once again @entity1 were strangled as discipline disappeared and attacking quality went missing			0
@entity47 was sent to the bin for a cynical 61st - minute stamp on @entity76 , which could easily have brought a red card from referee @entity218			0
as it was , the yellow compounded his side ’s woes and undid a lot of excellent work from @entity1 ’s hooker			0
indeed , most concerning for @entity1 ’s coaches is that despite the set - piece being rock solid , they are failing to create chances and field position on the back of it			2
@entity1 out - scrummaged their opponents with ease in an area the @entity6 would have expected to dominate			1
@entity1 ’s lineout functioned well again , with @entity50 enjoying a fine game in tandem with his @entity238 team - mate @entity47			2
so what on earth is going wrong ? @entity5 was shown a yellow card after collapsing a maul following warnings to both sides by referee @entity218 @entity40 takes a high ball and is tackled in the air by @entity6 's full back @entity248 @entity1 full back @entity40 pushes his @entity251 counterpart @entity65 @entity48 crosses for @entity1 as the hosts make @entity6 pay following the sin - binning of @entity6 's @entity5 @entity1 's @entity58 twists in the tackle to get the ball down for @entity1 's second try another try for the @entity1 forwards comes from @entity58 as the home side make the most of the one - man advantage 1 ) losing the breakdown battle			1
must generate quick ball for the backs			0
if you wo n’t use them ? 2 ) talented wingers are isolated			0
why pick them 3 ) kicking game needs improvement			0
no territory means no points			0
@entity1 must start taking the few they ’re creating			2
some home truths need telling behind closed doors			0
in his first start on the right wing , @entity41 hardly touched the ball while @entity278 was also criminally underused on the other flank			0
@entity1 ’s much - criticised kicking game was barely any better on saturday , with @entity44 unable to manoeuvre his forwards around the pitch and lacking the passing game to get the back line moving			1
the @entity285 was completely outshone by his opposite man @entity69 , who kicked 16 points including a late drop goal and pulled the strings superbly for his side			0
scrum - half @entity158 was ponderous around the breakdown as @entity1 ’s back row were dominated and the quick ball backs desperately crave to attack the gain - line never materialised			1
@entity51 carried better than in recent matches but gave away too many penalties while @entity49 failed to let @entity41 loose with the line at his mercy on 25 minutes			0
same old mistakes , same old story			0
@entity4 may not be for turning , but @entity1 ’s fans deserve so much better than this			0
with the @entity110 looming , there ’s very little to sing about			0
@entity1 captain @entity27 converses with referee @entity218 during their test at @entity10 @entity47 walks from the pitch after being sin - binned following @entity309 's chat with his @entity310 @entity1 lock @entity50 charges down the kick of @entity69 @entity4 's side must now regroup ahead of next week 's clash with @entity201			1

@entity6 defeated @entity1 31 - 28 in their second *autumn* international at @entity10 on saturday
for the second week running , @entity1 were beaten at the breakdown and the scoreboard flattered the hosts
the first 15 minutes were dire with balls regularly spilled in slippery , but far from treacherous , handling conditions
@entity1 were quickly 10 - 0 down and were lucky to reach half time at 13 - 6 , which was soon 20 - 6 after the break
with @entity5 sin - binned , @entity1 hit back with tries through forwards @entity48 and @entity58
@entity58 will surely start next week against @entity201 after a dire performance from @entity52
