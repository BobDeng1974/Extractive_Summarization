@entity12 , who has sold millions of copies of her books about @entity4 and his younger sister @entity4 , said the @entity8 became ‘ terribly worried ’ during talks of adapting her novels for the small screen			1
the illustrator and writer told @entity21 magazine that when it came to making the animated tv series , the corporation was concerned about the potential for injury when @entity4 did a forward roll			1
@entity12 , who has sold millions of copies of her books about @entity4 and his younger sister @entity4 , said the @entity8 became ' terribly worried ' during talks of adapting her novels for the small screen ‘ we almost had a problem with @entity4 doing forward rolls , ’ she told the magazine			1
‘ the @entity8 got terribly worried she could have a dreadful accident and break her neck			1
‘ it does n't matter that she and @entity4 are fictional , and they 're made of paper			2
the designers had to draw a very squishy mattress for her to do her forward roll on			1
’ ms @entity12 's also said that an episode she proposed in which @entity4 caught head - lice was rejected by the @entity42 corporation , which had partially financed the show			1
her comments came as the magazine compiled a shortlist of the best @entity8 children 's characters though the decades , featuring the likes of @entity50 and sweep from the 1950s , and shows such as @entity51 from the 1960s , @entity53 in the 1970s , @entity54 in the 1980s and more recently , @entity55			1
@entity56 , who devised the much - loved @entity57 - a spin - off from @entity60 - told the magazine that children 's tv had become too safe			1
he said : ‘ slapstick is a universal language			0
there 's a lot of comedy in other people 's pain , of course			2
‘ but there are things you ca n't do on children 's shows			1
we ca n't really have characters being hit on the head			2
we do n't want to be responsible for kids hitting each other with frying pans			0
the illustrator and writer told @entity21 magazine that when it came to making the animated tv series for @entity86 , the corporation was concerned about the potential for injury when @entity4 performed a forward roll ‘ but i sometimes think children 's tv can be overly safe			1
i do n't think cartoon - style violence affects kids			0
i think it 's a bit of escapism			0
’ he said of watching @entity95 's @entity94 during his own childhood : ‘ they used to lift children out of tea chests by their ears			2
then , one saturday , one of the kids cut himself on the edge of the chest , and was bleeding on live tv			0
‘ @entity105 lifted him out , put him to one side and said : “ could you pass me another one that 's not bleeding ? ” and they carried on with the show			0
can you imagine the front pages of the newspapers if that happened today ? ’ meanwhile @entity115 - whose show @entity116 has raked in millions of pounds from tv sales and merchandising around the world and also features on the list - said his series was nearly called @entity122 or @entity123			2
he said : ‘ it was a toss - up between @entity122 and @entity116			0
but @entity125 did n't sound quite right			0
’ @entity115 said that he was advised that the term ‘ builder ’ is not often used in the @entity128 , ‘ but , thankfully , in the end they let us keep the name ’			0
@entity133 , co-creator of the @entity55 , also recalled her horror of learning @entity128 evangelist @entity135 had denounced one of the show 's characters - @entity136 - who is purple and carries a handbag , for ‘ role modelling the gay lifestyle ’			2
‘ it was so insulting , ’ she told the magazine			0
‘ the fact is that children 's television is about love , it 's got nothing to do with sex at all			1
and all children - boys and girls - love to look in your handbag			0
i have n't known a child who did n't			0
