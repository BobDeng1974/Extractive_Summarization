' @entity3 was n't very well informed about this , ' he said			2
' i think he just might have been trying to give @entity11 an extra ratings boost on his show			0
' scroll down for audio having the last laugh : president @entity1 reponded to @entity3 's criticism of his golf ability by suggesting the basketball legend focuses less on his game and more on his losing basketball team not happy : @entity3 reacts to a call during a @entity34 game in 2013 - the team is currently 1 - 3 down he went on : ' but there is no doubt that @entity3 is a better golfer than i am			1
