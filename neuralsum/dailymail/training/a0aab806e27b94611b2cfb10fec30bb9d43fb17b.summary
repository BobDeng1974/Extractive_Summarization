by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 20:37 est , 4 may 2013 it 's a perfect reason to crack open the champagne – new research suggests three glasses of bubbly a week can improve your memory			1
scientists are convinced a regular tipple of champagne can help prevent brain disorders such as dementia and alzheimer ’s disease			1
connoisseurs have long argued its benefits			2
barrister and crime writer sir @entity16 drank a glass of champagne every morning and said it was the secret to a long life			2
cheers : scientists believe a little champagne may be good for you but the study at @entity27 is the first time scientists have identified health benefits in champagne			1
in @entity32 – where one in three over- 65s develops dementia – it could be revolutionary			2
the compound that helps stave off forgetfulness has been found in the black grapes , pinot noir and pinot meunier , used for champagne			1
@entity40 , a biochemistry professor who led the research , said : ‘ these grapes are used in red wine and lots of research has been done on the health benefits of red wine , so i was curious to find out if there were any health attributes in champagne			1
’ red wine , if consumed modestly , has been found to help lower blood pressure and protect the heart			2
this is due to the compound chemicals in vines known as flavonoids			0
the memory aid found in champagne , however , is a different compound , phenolic acid			1
the study at @entity27 is the first time scientists have identified health benefits in champagne prof @entity40 suggested anyone over 40 would be wise to drink two or three glasses of bubbly a week			1
he said : ‘ dementia probably starts in the 40s and goes on to the 80s			2
it is a gradual decline and so the earlier people take these beneficial compounds in champagne , the better			2
’ about 80 per cent of all champagne is made from the two black grape varieties blended with a white @entity75 grape			2
researchers found that after champagne was consumed there was a significant boost to spatial memory – the ability to recognise surroundings that enables people to find their way home			1
the experiments were conducted on rats but prof @entity40 is confident there would be a similar impact on the human brain			0
the rats were given champagne daily with it mixed in their feed like a mash for six weeks			0
each rat was allowed to run in a maze to find an edible treat			0
five minutes later , the exercise was repeated to see if the rat had remembered where it had retrieved the original treat and where it could find another			0
without champagne , the rats had a 50 per cent success rate , but after a tipple their score shot up to an average 70 per cent			1
biopsy tests measured proteins which are important for short - term memory			0
prof @entity40 said : ‘ the results were dramatic			0
after rats consumed champagne regularly , there was a 200 per cent increase of proteins important for determining effective memory			1
this occurred in rats after just six weeks			0
we think it would take about three years in humans			0
‘ this research is exciting because it illustrates for the first time that moderate consumption of champagne has the potential to influence cognitive functioning such as memory			1
’ he is now hoping to conduct a trial on about 50 or 60 people aged over 65 who will be asked to drink champagne for three years			0
a spokesman for the @entity133 said : ‘ this is an interesting study , especially for those who enjoy a glass of bubbly			0
however , people should not start celebrating just yet			0
this is the first time a link between champagne and dementia risk reduction has been found			1
a lot more research is needed			0

study at @entity27 finds health benefits in champagne
scientists convinced a regular tipple can help with dementia and @entity152 's
they found consumption *greatly* improves spatial memory
