no ordinary person would get involved in it			0
' the illegal houses not only pose a threat to the river ecology but to the area 's mythological heritage as well			2
the illegal buildings , marked by the red dots , on @entity4 's floodplains are two kilometres away from the land scam site ' @entity4 's original name is @entity53 in @entity54			1
this land is the taposthali ( abode ) of @entity58 , the father of @entity60			2
several old temples , some dating back to a thousand years , still exist today in @entity63 near the river			0
' the river embankment is also a rich habitat of birds and peacocks			0
the illegal constructions are destroying the rich heritage and wildlife , ' @entity69 of farmers ' association @entity70 said			2
the place where the mafia has usurped the plots is located barely 50m from @entity78 , the address of another multicrore land scam that was uncovered in 2010			1
in @entity78 , the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) bought farmland at throwaway prices to set up @entity84 but sold the real estate to private builders , who built flats and sold them to buyers			2
the fate of those flats is now locked in litigations in both the @entity93 and the @entity94			0
altogether , more than 2,500 acres of land in the floodplains of @entity4 has been sold by the mafia over the past three years , helped by unscrupulous government officials			1
what 's the scam ? thousands of acres of land in the floodplains of @entity4 havebeen sold by the land mafia , allegedly hand in glove with @entity106 officials , to private buyers			1
already , scores ofconcrete structures have mushroomed on these plots , some as close as 20m from the river 's course who sold the land to the mafia ? farmers of adjoining villages such as @entity117 and @entity118 , who were the original owners of the plots			1
land - use and jurisdiction , however , rests with the @entity124 irrigation department can houses be built on these plots ? river basin regulations stipulate that only farming can be undertaken in the floodplains - and nothing else			1
in ' protected ' floodplains , even farming is prohibited and needs the environment ministry 's nod the plots have been sold mostly to people from @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and even illegal @entity142 migrants			1
local real estate dealers put the value of the land at nearly rs 1,000 crore , at rs 1 crore per hectare			1
the encroached floodplain is enclosed by roads on two sides and slices the @entity150 district into @entity7 and @entity151			0

sources said most land sharks operating in the stretch are hardened criminals and gangsters , linked to the ruling government and regional political parties			1
the land sharks are in cahoots with officials in the registrar 's office			1
the mafia makes farmers sign blank stamp papers			0
dishonest officials get the agreement registered without physically verifying the land in question and checking its land - use			1
the officials do it knowingly , well aware that plots with sizes 120 sqm and less that come up before them for registration are too less a holding size for agriculture purposes and would be used to build houses			1
further , the registrar officials facilitate the registration without obtaining the mandatory @entity200 report on the land in question			1
officials in the tehsildar 's office are also in cahoots with the mafia			2
the tehsildars get the mutation ( transfer of ownership ) done merely on the basis of the patwari 's report , who connives with the land mafia and submit their reports about the status of the said land			2
