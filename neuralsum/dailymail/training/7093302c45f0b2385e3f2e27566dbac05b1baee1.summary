by @entity0 published : 02:29 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 21 may 2013 a @entity2 mountaineer has reached the peak of @entity4 for a record - breaking eleventh time			1
@entity6 scaled the mountain as part of a challenge to reach three summits in one continuous climb			1
the 39 - year - old , who lives in @entity13 , @entity14 , is the first person ever to achieve the feat reaching the three peaks in three days			1
all three form what is called the @entity25 - a wall of rock and ice that is part of the route to @entity4			1
an update yesterday on his @entity32 page said he and climbing partner @entity35 were ' feeling strong '			2
at noon he tweeted : ' @entity36 : @entity22 has been summited			1
3 summits in 3 days			2
' reaching new heights : the three peaks @entity6 scaled were @entity4 , @entity21 , and @entity22 the treble : @entity6 and @entity35 in their tent in @entity4 the climbs have been described as a fitting tribute to @entity47 and sherpa @entity48 who reached the 29,035 - foot summit of @entity4 on may 29 , 1953 , becoming the first people to stand atop the world 's highest mountain			1
this week will mark the 60th anniversary of the ascent			2
mr @entity6 last year took one of the 1924 @entity58 medals to the summit of @entity4 to fulfill a pledge by one of the @entity4 pioneers - 1922 expedition deputy leader , lieutenant colonel @entity61			1
@entity6 last year took one of the 1924 @entity58 medals to the summit of @entity4 he said : ' in 1894 baron @entity64 reconstituted the modern @entity58 movement and made a deliberate choice to include our sport of climbing			1
' he felt so strongly about climbing 's inclusion that in 1924 he personally awarded the first ever @entity58 gold medals for mountaineering , and in 2012 i fulfilled the subsequent promise made by @entity76 to baron @entity64 and the @entity77 to place one of the 1924 mountaineering @entity58 gold medals on to the summit of the world 's highest mountain ' for all humanity '			0
' climbing is the very essence of everything baron @entity64 meant when he wrote the @entity58 motto of ' higher , faster , stronger ' , and it was there on the very first day of the modern @entity58			0
' may 29 , 2013 will be a momentous day for climbing			0
it is the 60th anniversary of the first successful summit of @entity4 and it is the date the @entity92 will present their case to the @entity77			2
i 'm backing the bid			0
' climbing in the @entity58 would be different to scaling everest - competition climbing takes place on man - made walls and the @entity92 is proposing a multi-discipline ' triathlon ' of speed , lead climbing and bouldering			2
the bid is also being supported by @entity104			0
she said : ' the proposed triathlon format for @entity107 's bid for the @entity108 sounds like a great concept			0
' i know climbing is very popular with young people and the format fits perfectly with the @entity58 motto of @entity114			0
' i know the case for inclusion in the @entity58 is becoming tougher all the time , it could go down to the wire when the final choice is made by the @entity77 in september			0
hopefully the general public will see that @entity107 has a big future ahead			0

the 39 - year - old , from @entity14 , is the first person to achieve the feat
the three peaks he scaled were @entity4 , @entity21 , and @entity22
the climb has been described as a fitting tribute to @entity47 and sherpa @entity48 who first climbed @entity4 60 years *ago* this week
