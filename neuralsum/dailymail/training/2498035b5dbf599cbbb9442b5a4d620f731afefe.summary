he said that he has been haunted by recurring flashbacks since the incident and is seeking damages for his injuries and for @entity41			2
when @entity10 , an amputee , was moved to @entity43 following the attack , he claims he was assaulted by a @entity19 inmate who ' kicked him in his remaining leg '			1
his barrister , @entity47 , told a judge that ' no one has ever apologised to mr @entity10 ' , who has since been transferred to serve out his jail term in @entity52			2
@entity10 , 66 , who watched the court proceedings today via video link , claims the authorities at @entity20 negligently failed to take ' all reasonable steps ' to protect him			1
that was despite the fact that the jail is a ' high security prison housing some of the @entity7 's most dangerous male lifers ' , said mr @entity47			0

@entity10 was attacked as he served a 35 - year sentence in @entity20 ( pictured )			1
he was moved to a different facility following the incident the war criminal was moved to @entity43 where he claims he was attacked again by a @entity19 inmate they say he was at no greater risk in the prison system than a paedophile would be			1
government barrister , @entity77 , also suggested that @entity10 had ' exaggerated the consequences of the attack in terms of his ptsd '			0
@entity10 was convicted for his part in the massacre of more than 8,000 @entity32 men and boys who had been rounded up in the @entity86 's supposedly safe haven of @entity87 in july 1995			1
at the time he was one of the most powerful men in the @entity90 army , second only to general @entity91 , who is still on the run from war crimes investigators			0
he was arrested in a daring joint @entity96 and @entity95 snatch in @entity26 in december 1998			0
in 2001 he became the first man to be convicted of genocide by the @entity99 in the @entity100 and was sentenced to 46 years in prison			0
this was overturned on appeal and replaced by a 35 - year sentence for aiding and abetting genocide			1
mr @entity47 said his client was in his cell when three @entity19 attackers stormed in and slashed at him with a ' razor - blade attached to a toothbrush handle '			2
he said : ' they held mr @entity10 down and cut his head and neck with their weapon , he understood that the prisoners were trying to kill him			0
' the three prisoners then left , saying , " he 's finished " , meaning that they believed he would die from the injuries they had inflicted on him			0
' @entity10 had lost part of his right leg in a mine blast during the @entity26 war and was less able to defend himself , he added			2
but mr @entity47 said that nothing he had experienced in the war zone compared with the mental torment left by the prison attack			0
@entity10 was convicted for his part in the massacre of more than 8,000 @entity32 men and boys who had been rounded up in the @entity86 's supposedly safe haven of @entity87 in july 1995 he said : ' he has a poor prognosis ; it is unlikely that there will be anything other than a modest improvement in his disorder with the further passage of time			1
' he added that the ex-general was lucky to escape with his life and was marked with ' severe facial scarring '			2
his three attackers were tried and convicted of wounding with intent over the razor attack in february 2011			0
mr @entity47 said there had been a ' glaring ' risk of an attack occurring at @entity20 - given @entity152 's high - profile status and the wide publicity surrounding his case			2
there were also numerous ' red flag incidents ' in the months before the attack which should have triggered heightened vigilance by prison staff , said the barrister			0
he added : ' his offences were exceptional and they put him at risk from certain other prisoners			0
' but this risk was not exceptional and was in fact no different from the risk from other prisoners faced by numerous sex offenders and prisoners who have committed violent or sexual offences against children '			0
judge @entity172 , sitting at @entity171 , has now reserved judgment and will rule on the case at a later date .			0
