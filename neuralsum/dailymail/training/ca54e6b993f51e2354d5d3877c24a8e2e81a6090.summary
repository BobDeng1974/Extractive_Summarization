by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 16:09 est , 4 october 2012 high street store @entity1 notched up yet another hit collaboration as @entity4 's bold gold accessories line was snapped up in moments by frantic shoppers			1
queues formed outside @entity1 stores from the early hours as shoppers eager to be the first to get their hands on the bold pieces made sure they were at the front of the line			1
wristbands were handed out to those waiting to buy the collection , allowing them a 15 - minute slot in the store			1
unlike with previous collections ( like @entity21 and @entity22 , where extraordinarily high demand was predicted ) no quantity restrictions were placed on shoppers this morning - meaning some shoppers left the store with large bags bulging with the jewelled cuffs , gold - framed sunglasses and brightly coloured statement necklaces			1
happy shoppers @entity32 and @entity33 , both 23 , emerge with bags more than they intended on buying first in the queue at the @entity38 branch of @entity1 were marketing students @entity32 and @entity33 , both 23 , who arrived at 6am			1

' @entity33 says she was at the launch of the @entity22 collection herself and , after witnessing the crowds who turned up for that launch , made sure to arrive in good time today - and had already picked out the pieces she wanted to take home			2
' today i 'm looking for the orange necklace			2
the shoes are too much , too fancy , ' she said			1

' i want to get the trolley bag for my sister , as it 's sold out in the @entity66			1
' @entity33 and @entity67 , both 21 , arrived at around 10.50am			2
' i 'm expecting lots of gold , very opulent pieces , statement pieces , bright gold and eccentric accessories , ' said @entity33			2
' we really like her snake bracelets and some of the crocodile pieces are quite cute			2
' today @entity32 and @entity33 ( pictured ) queued outside @entity38 's @entity1 since 6am with coffees and @entity78 only intending to purchase one set of jewellery each but emerged just after 10am with bags full of shopping queues formed from 6am awaiting the store 's 9am opening ; eager shoppers got time - allocation wristbands while they 'd never been to one of @entity1 's designer collaboration openings before @entity33 's mother had gone to the @entity91 one and encouraged the girls to go			1
' it 's definitely worth getting up this early , ' said @entity33			1
@entity96 , 23 , from @entity97 saw a necklace that she wanted in a magazine and arrived early to make sure she 'd bag it			0

' scenes at @entity111 , @entity97 , were hectic as shoppers fought to get their hands on their wish - list items			1
a cascade of gold balloons welcomed customers into the store as dj @entity119 spinned @entity122 ’s ‘ @entity121 ’ on the decks			2
the store was a sea of @entity125 as face masks were handed to shoppers adding to the party atmosphere			1
a giant ankle boot and bracelet from the collection took centre stage in store			2
the collection , by @entity135 editor @entity4 , was a striking line of jewellery , sunglasses , shoes , bags predominantly in gold shot through with flashes of turquoise , orange and green glass and resin jewels			1
animal motifs including snakes and crocodiles grace some of the jewellery , and @entity4 's own pet pooch makes a cameo appearance in clasp of one clutch bag			1
more expensive items included knee high and over the knee thigh skimming boots and an oversized feather fascinator			0
one shopper snapped one up at the @entity38 store			2

i tried to capture that sense of freedom , joy and excitement , ' she said			0
she added : ' besides , when we travel we always want to bring our special pieces with us			0
i like the idea of a trolley that can contain the whole collection and is complete with a crown - shaped tag : airports will be less grey and impersonal if you bring such a token of travel - ware with you			0
' it ’s like a dash of fairy tale magic , or @entity245 ’s white rabbit as a door to a new dimension			0
