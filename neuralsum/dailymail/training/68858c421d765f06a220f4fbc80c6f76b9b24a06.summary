@entity0 can no longer rely on @entity1 being her alibi in the @entity4 murder case , with @entity1 now denying she was with him the whole of the night on which the @entity7 student was brutally murdered			1
this change in his defence could potentially incriminate @entity12			1
@entity1 and @entity12 were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison , respectively , for the murder of @entity15 in @entity16 and served four years before being released in 2011			1
@entity12 and @entity1 have always maintained that they were together the evening of the brutal 2007 murder in @entity16 , after which miss @entity15 , 21 , was found half naked her throat slit in the cottage she shared with @entity12			1
but @entity1 's lawyer @entity21 said that ' for the entire first part of the evening , they were not together			1
it ’s this first part of the evening that ’s new [ to his defence ] '			2
@entity1 has pointed to phone records that show that @entity12 was away from his house for part of the evening			1
in a dramatic change of legal tactics that he announced in a press conference in @entity23 he has now claimed there are ‘ anomalies ’ in @entity12 ’s story			1
determined : @entity12 , a @entity57 student , has been in the @entity58 since 2011 and has vowed the she would never ' willingly ' return to @entity18 to face her fate in court brutal : @entity4 was stabbed to death in 2007 @entity12 says that she received a text , while at @entity1 ’s house , from her boss , telling her not to come to her job at a nightclub that night			1
but phone records show that the text was received on the road between their houses , something that their retrial judges felt was key in their reconstruction of events			0
@entity1 's phone and computer records show that he was at home that evening			1
@entity1 said : ‘ i have always believed in the innocence of @entity0			1
but i have to react to the accusations of the court and to the text message			0
‘ either the court has made their umpteenth mistake or she lied to me			0
’ he added : ‘ i was in love with her and we had some very happy moments , but ultimately @entity0 was a stranger			2
' ' there are anomalies in her version of events			2
against me there is nothing			0
' the ' fundamental basis ' for the conviction is @entity12 ’s memo to police in which she says she was at the cottage when the murder took place , he said			1
‘ i believe this was a hallucination , but if the court believes it is true then they have to accept that she did not say i was there			0
she gave me an alibi			0
‘ it is not the first time @entity1 has expressed his doubts about the holes in @entity12 ’s story			1
in an interview with @entity18 television earlier this year , he said @entity12 had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower , he said			2
when she returned , she was ' very agitated , ' he said			0
she told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom , @entity1 said			2
but rather than call the police , she showered and returned to his place something he finds odd			0
‘ certainly i asked her questions , ' he said			0
' why did you take a shower ? why did she spend so much time there ? ' he did n't get any real answers from her , he said			0
@entity12 , a @entity57 student , has been in the @entity58 since 2011			2
she left @entity18 right after an earlier appeals court ruling overturned the initial lower court conviction that had led to her imprisonment in @entity18			0
the @entity58 , 28 , has vowed the she would never ' willingly ' return to @entity18 to face her fate in court			0
she has said she is hopeful @entity18 courts will ' once again recognize ' her innocence .			0

@entity1 and @entity12 reconvicted of @entity4 's murder in january
@entity0 's defence rests *heavily* on @entity1 being her alibi
she claims that on the night @entity15 was killed , she was at his flat
@entity1 has now said that there are ' anomalies ' in @entity12 's story
