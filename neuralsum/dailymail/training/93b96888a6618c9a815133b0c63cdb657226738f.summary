@entity0 , 38 , runs a catering company with her husband , @entity2 , 39 , and lives near @entity3 , @entity4 , with their daughters @entity6 , nine , and @entity7 , seven			1
@entity0 says : given that i ’ve lost more than 3st and dropped from a size 16 to a size 12 in three years , people assume that i must have been on some sort of extreme diet			1
actually , my weight loss and leaner , more toned figure is all down to one 90 - minute yoga class a week , plus practising a few poses at home when i get the chance			1
i was convinced it would be full of hippies			0
i was sceptical about how much difference yoga could actually make , and my husband , @entity2 , agreed			1
‘ you wo n’t be sweating , so what good will it do ? ’ he said			0
my reason for trying it was that i was quite stressed trying to juggle family life with running our catering business			1
my clothes were tight , i was out of shape , felt sluggish and had n’t had a good night ’s sleep in years			1
a family member , who is now my yoga teacher , suggested that i should give one of her classes a try			1
i was n’t sure , but she was adamant it would help me cope with all the demands being made of me and help me sleep better			0
she teaches @entity48 — best known because @entity49 does it — which is a fast - paced type of yoga			1
@entity48 is very structured and repetitive , and the idea is that you flow between poses without stopping , synchronising your breathing as you do , so the class feels like an exhilarating and challenging workout			1
but it ’s not just for people who are superfit and muscular like @entity49 — i ’m certainly not			0
it ’s brilliant for people of all fitness levels and flexibility because you ’re not in competition with each other , just aiming to improve your own ability			0
to my amazement , the night after my first class i slept like a baby , which was something i had n’t done in years			1
ordinarily , i would lie awake , fretting about how i ’d manage to get everything done the next day , but on that night a bomb could have gone off and i would n’t have heard it			0
a couple of days after the yoga lesson , my muscles ached in a way they had never done after the occasional three or four - mile jog that i ’d done in the past			2
it felt satisfying knowing i ’d obviously worked them well , even though it had n’t really felt like it at the time			0
yoga quickly became essential ‘ me ’ time away from the children and work , even if i could only fit in one session a week			2
and although i have n’t had a lot of time to devote to yoga , my body shape has changed almost beyond recognition			1
when i look in the mirror my upper arms , as well as my inner thighs and ‘ saddlebags ’ , have all shrunk and are tighter			0
my core is stronger and my tummy flatter			0
i ’m now a size 12 and sometimes even a size 10 on my bottom half — i ’m 5ft 5in tall			1
my weight hovers around 9st 7lb , as opposed to the 13st i was before			0
i lost the first half a stone within a matter of weeks of taking up yoga , and the rest steadily over the next couple of years			1
when i ca n’t get to my weekly yoga class — typically during the summer months , when @entity2 and i are rushed off our feet with the business — i gain at least half a stone in just a couple of weeks , and feel lethargic and less toned			1
pop icon , @entity49 ( pictured ) , also practices @entity48 - a fast - paced type of yoga which is very structured and repetitive apart from becoming a yoga devotee , i have n’t really changed a lot else to explain the weight loss			1
i certainly would n’t consider doing a faddy diet			0
but yoga has had a knock - on effect on the food choices i make			2
on the day of a class , i eat only a very light dinner , such as a salad — you ca n’t go to yoga on a full stomach or you ’d feel very uncomfortable doing the poses and probably give yourself indigestion			2
because doing a class leaves me feeling so good inside , for a couple of days afterwards i find myself naturally drawn towards healthy snacks such as fruit or nuts instead of crisps and chocolate			0
even i ’m shocked at what a huge impact taking up yoga has had on the shape of my body , and how much more energised and calm i feel			1
there are postures i still ca n’t master , but i hope that in years to come i will manage them			2
so , even though classes follow the same structure each week , yoga never stops being a challenge			2
i ’ll be doing it for the rest of my life now			1

' i dropped two sizes without dieting ' @entity161 , 38 , works part - time in retail			1
she lives with her partner @entity163 , 44 , and their daughters rain , ten , and @entity166 , two , in @entity167			0
she says : four years ago my cousin came to my 34th birthday party looking fabulous			2
she was more toned than she ’d been in years and i asked what her secret was			1
she told me she had started doing yoga , specifically @entity174 yoga , and said i should come to a class			1
at the time i was n’t very happy with my body			2
i ’d been putting on weight since the birth of my first daughter — before @entity182 ’s arrival i ’d been a size 10 - 12 , now i was a size 14 and felt flabby			1
@entity161 , 38 , takes classes in @entity185 yoga , which is practiced in heats of around 40c			1
@entity161 has lost more than a stone since starting @entity185 , despite having made barely any changes to her diet i knew @entity185 yoga was done in high heat , but that was about it			1
on the internet i learned the heat enables you to stretch into postures more safely			0
the humidity also promotes sweating , which is believed to help flush toxins from the body			2
when i walked into my first class the heat ( about 40c or 104f , and 60 per cent humidity ) hit me and my first concern was : ‘ what ’s my hair going to look like after this ? ’ people say they ca n’t try yoga because they ca n’t touch their toes — and that was true with me			2
i could n’t do half the things we were being asked to do , but i had a go			0
at the end i felt invigorated			0
that day i ’d been feeling down , but the yoga left me upbeat and energised			2
i joined the yoga studio in january 2011 and went every other day for nearly a month			2
after that , i took out a monthly subscription			0
i was impressed by how quickly my shape began to change			2
so did how i felt about my body			0
after about two months i noticed that my legs were more toned , and so was my stomach			0
when i found out i was pregnant again , i carried on doing yoga			0
you can do pregnancy @entity185 where the temperature is a little lower , but i went to my normal classes			0
after i ’d had @entity166 i slipped right back into my jeans			0
my doctor tells me i ’ve lost more than a stone since i started yoga			1
my diet has changed very little , although i do eat less because i ’m drinking around two litres of water a day			0
my mind feels much calmer , too .			0

@entity0 , 38 , has dropped from a size 16 to a size 12
she says her leaner , more toned figure is all down to @entity48 yoga
although *initially* sceptical , she says she *'ll* be doing it for the rest of her life
@entity161 , 38 , has been doing @entity174 yoga for four years
she *'s* lost more than a stone and can see a real change in her body
