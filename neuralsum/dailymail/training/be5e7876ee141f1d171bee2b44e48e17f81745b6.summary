he had been secretly indicted in april on a murder charge in the death of 23 - year - old @entity19 , which had previously been thought an accident , when she fell 100 feet on a steep , narrow path in march 2009			1
heartbreaking : family members say @entity19 , 23 , left behind a young daughter , and confirmed that she was dating @entity25 , now aged 40 , at the time of her death killer boyfriend ? @entity29 ( left ) , was arrested at @entity10 on february 12 in connection with @entity19 's death ( right )			1
her falling during a hike was ruled accidental at the time he did not appear to have been a suspect in the death of his nine - years - younger girlfriend death when her lifeless body was found on march 16 , 2009			1
investigators have not revealed if they believe @entity29 pushed her or how she may have fallen about a mile from a trailhead in the @entity42 , 45 miles east of @entity43			2
court documents show @entity29 and @entity19 became romantically involved in 2005 and had a daughter , who is now six , according to @entity47 it was not clear who has custody of the girl			1
the papers reveal that the couple each bought a $ 1million life insurance policy in late 2008 from @entity56 and named each other as beneficiaries , records show			1
their daughter was named as contingent beneficiary			0
@entity29 sued @entity56 after it denied his $ 1million claim			1
the company said the insurance policy was void because of omissions on the application			2
@entity56 asserted in a counterclaim that " it is unclear whether plaintiff / counterclaim defendant @entity73 was involved in the murder of @entity19 , " according to a june 2011 opinion written by @entity71 district judge @entity70			2
if he was , the company said , he may not be entitled to the money under @entity2 law			0

@entity19 's mother , @entity90 , filed a wrongful - death suit against @entity29 that @entity70 dismissed			1

@entity29 is being held without bail in an @entity2 jail , and he is scheduled to appear in court march 3			2

@entity113 , 58 , stood to benefit from three life insurance policies totaling $ 4.5 million , court documents said			1
ms @entity115 told @entity116 12 at the time of @entity19 â€™s death : ' i think about her last moments , and what she was thinking when she fell			2
narrow : at the time , @entity19 's death was ruled accidental			1
it was then believed that she slipped of the trail			0
pictures of the @entity125 show how narrow it becomes at points ' how she 's not going to get to see her daughter take her first steps			0
and how i 'm never going to get to see my daughter again			0
' not many details were released about @entity19 's death at the time , other than that a ' male companion ' ( now identified as @entity29 ) , called 911 around 6pm to say she had fallen off a ledge while they were hiking the @entity125 the popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past , due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine			1
the trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the trail slippery			0
@entity19 was one of four hikers who either fell to their death or died of exposure on @entity42 trails like @entity125 that year			0
' the trail is very steep and narrow there , and it 's been pretty wet and slippery , ' @entity99 sheriff 's deputy @entity151 told @entity47 in 2009			0
' there was still snow on the ground down near the parking lot			0
' it 's currently unclear why @entity19 's case was reopened and the cause of death switched to homicide			2
@entity29 is currently being held without bail and his next court appearance is scheduled for march 3 at 11am .			0
