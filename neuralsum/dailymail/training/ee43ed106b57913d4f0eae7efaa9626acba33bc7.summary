by @entity0 @entity1 : 23:19 est , 15 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:12 est , 16 december 2013 he is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures of modern times whose death was mourned across the globe			2
but @entity9 ranks just 356th in a table of people ’s historical importance created by a @entity14 engineer using similar systems to the way the search engine ranks web pages			1
@entity19 tops the list with @entity22 second and @entity24 third			1
@entity25 ( right ) is ranked 37th , thirty places behind @entity27 ( left )			1
the @entity29 wartime leader is ranked lower than former @entity31 president @entity30 although he is the highest placed prime minister @entity32 is the highest placed @entity33 in fourth position , while @entity35 is way down in 1,483rd spot			1
@entity25 is ranked 37th , thirty places behind @entity27			1
the @entity29 wartime leader is also ranked lower than former @entity31 presidents @entity30 and @entity38			1

queen elizabeth i is the highest ranked woman at 13 , three places above @entity41 @entity43			2
they are two of just three women in the top hundred , along with @entity47			2
the list was compiled using a programme which mainly draws on how significant someone ’s entry is on internet encyclopaedia @entity52 as well as mentions on online newspaper reports , books published on the web and other parts of the internet			1
the system gives equal weight to both celebrity and gravitas , but aims to assess people ’s long term fame by including a ‘ reputation decay ’ mathematical formula which predicts their impact up to 200 years after they die			2
@entity69 would be ranked 27th most significant person on her current fame but drops to 689th when the decay formula is applied			2
table : @entity9 ranks just 356th in a table of people 's historical importance created by a @entity14 engineer using similar systems to the way the search engine ranks web pages using @entity52 @entity82 , professor of computer science at @entity85 ’s @entity84 and co creator of the formula , said @entity9 ’s apparently lowly position was a ‘ fair ranking			1
’ he said : ‘ @entity90 does not mean better			0
‘ @entity9 is the highest ranked @entity91 leader and a few places above @entity93 , the founder of modern @entity94 , which makes sense			1
‘ both men could be viewed as founders of their respective nations and therefore of similar significance in the long term			0
’ he said the software suggested that a third of historical figures currently studied in @entity31 school are relatively ‘ obscure ’ and had little impact on modern society			0
he added : ‘ the quantitative approach to ranking someone ’s significance provides another way to look at many things , not just history			0
‘ i suspect about a third of workers hired by companies from a pool of candidates are not the best people for the job			0
‘ a more scientific approach might be a way of helping to correct inevitable human errors			0
’ but historian @entity124 said the idea that historical significance could be reduced to a formula was ‘ preposterous ’			0
‘ you simply can not calibrate history and assess it in that way , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s just a question of how they construct their algorithm and how they view their weightings			0
’ professor @entity82 and his colleague @entity138 , an engineer with @entity14 , have published their findings in a book called who ’s bigger ? where @entity143			0
it names @entity146 as the most significant musician in history at 24th , three places ahead of @entity150 and 24 ahead of @entity151 , according to the list			1
