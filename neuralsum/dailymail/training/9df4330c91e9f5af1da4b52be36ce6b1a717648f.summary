amid the blood and the thunder , a moment of real quality			2
thanks to @entity1 's right instep @entity2 continue down the qualification route with hope refreshed			1
for 75 minutes here at breathless @entity20 , we had been given what we expected			1
non-stop football low on persistent quality but high on endeavour and adrenaline			2
there were some good players on show in @entity29 , though , and , with 15 minutes left , one of them stepped forward to deliver the decisive blow that leaves both these nations in the mix for qualification for @entity36 2016			1

previously , @entity119 goalkeeper @entity43 had plucked @entity121 set - pieces out of the air with comfort			2
this time , though , the ball was played low to @entity63 and when the @entity2 captain laid it in to the path of @entity1 the curling shot in to the far corner was exquisite and unstoppable			1
@entity2 manager @entity70 thanked one his coaches , @entity130 , for a routine straight from the training ground			1
the pretty patterns laid out on paper need executing when the stakes are high , though , and moments like this one can define careers			2
@entity1 is a technically talented footballer but one currently playing near the foot of the @entity139 with @entity140			1
at almost 32 , he may fear his best days are behind him			0
his goal , though , his moment of supreme calm amid the chaos , has given @entity2 something to cling to in a group that looks as though it will last the distance			1
as such – with games against @entity149 and a return against @entity4 to come in the first half of next year – @entity1 's season all of a sudden becomes something more than a scrap against gravity in the @entity156 football pyramid			1
on friday night @entity1 was his country 's best player alongside @entity158 's @entity49			1
this was not a game devoid of quality altogether but these two provided more of it than most			0
' they were brave , ' said @entity70			1
' little men in a physical game , where the ball was fizzing about and tackles were flying in			0
' as a spectacle this was mesmerising			0
' the fans made it special and the players wanted to jump higher , run faster and tackle harder			0
' it was like a big heavyweight boxing match			0
' narrowly , @entity2 deserved their win			1
they could have been reduced to ten men in the first half when @entity61 followed a yellow card with a reckless leap at @entity43			0
as it was , he remained on the field and it was the @entity186 defender 's header against his own bar in injury time that came closest to giving @entity104 's team an equaliser			2
@entity104 will not panic about this loss			0
his team 's chances of qualification probably lie in a home programme next calendar year that sees @entity2 come to the @entity197 as well as @entity198 and group favourites @entity200 and @entity201			1
nevertheless , he knows his team did n't play as well as they can on friday night			2
@entity1 applauds the @entity52 at the end of the match as @entity2 clinch a crucial 1 - 0 win at home to the @entity4 @entity63 is congratulated by an over-eager fan who invades the @entity20 pitch at the end of the match before being led away @entity4 manager @entity104 ( left ) grabs the ball off @entity70 ( centre ) as @entity56 looks on in the background @entity2 's @entity64 ( centre ) celebrates victory at the end of the match as @entity2 move up to third position in @entity217 @entity2 's @entity49 ( right ) battles for the ball with the @entity4 's @entity88 in the @entity221 qualifier @entity4 were the better team for the first 15 minutes of each half			1
only in the second , though , did they create chances , @entity84 coming to life as @entity2 goalkeeper @entity58 saved from him and from centre forward @entity90			1
the second chance – a header from six yards – really should have gone in			0
that apart , @entity2 were on top			1
much of their football was hurried			0
when they did play , however , they were progressive			0
@entity49 was terrific behind main striker @entity234 while either side of the @entity158 player @entity1 and @entity238 's @entity237 were dangerous			1
had @entity66 shown a little more quality and , at times , a sharper instinct , @entity2 may have led earlier			2
the @entity243 player headed an early corner over and another first half chance wide			0
when @entity65 crossed low from the left near half - time , meanwhile , @entity66 was caught on his heels			0
as the stalemate dragged on , so the intensity of the game raised			0
the crowd had been rather quiet before kick - off but they were soon sucked deep in to the importance , the needs - must nature , of the game			0
@entity2 defender @entity61 ( left ) puts @entity4 goalkeeper @entity43 ( second left ) under pressure @entity4 assistant manager @entity56 shouts instructions to his team from the touchline at @entity20 @entity2 's @entity59 ( left ) takes a sore one as the @entity4 's @entity87 makes the challenge @entity2 captain @entity63 ( left ) is closed down by @entity87 during the @entity221 qualifier in @entity29 @entity61 ( right ) fouls @entity90 as @entity2 and the @entity4 battle it out in the @entity221 qualifiers refereed well by the @entity267 official , there were yellow cards but thankfully no red			1
the tackles were robust but rarely cynical			0
it was a game that deserved to finish with eleven playing eleven			0
midway through the second period , things got a bit much for @entity104 's assistant @entity56			2
he has had a long week			0
lectured for his boisterousness by the referee , he responded with a sarcastic salute but moments later he had something tangible to worry about as @entity2 surged in to the lead			2
' i thought we deserved a draw , ' said @entity104 afterwards			0
' we were comfortable and i thought we would get something out of it			0
' with @entity200 winning in @entity198 , both these teams still face a challenge to get out of this group			0
this , though , was an enormous result for the @entity121			0
@entity291 will face a team with their tails up here on tuesday			1
