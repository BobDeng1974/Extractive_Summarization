with a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms , this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store @entity3			1
the shocking picture was taken by a passer - by of a window display of the brand 's @entity7 store in @entity9			1
it shows the thin - looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top			1
in response to this photograph , which was taken this week , eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards			1
@entity19 of @entity20 is a fan of @entity3 and was pictured wearing one of the brand 's burgundy dresses			1
snapped : this is the shocking photo of a mannequin that was spotted in the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity9 @entity19 of @entity20 is a fan of @entity3 and was pictured wearing one of the brand 's burgundy dresses in @entity9 in 2013 @entity30 from @entity31 , the @entity32 's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders , said : ' it is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street			1
' this stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry does n't directly cause eating disorders - it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people			1
' we call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive , life enhancing ways			2
fashion can be fantastic - creative , aspirational and fun			0
' what we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people 's different shapes and sizes , heights , widths and build			0
' @entity62 , who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in @entity67 brand of @entity3 , said she found it ' revolting '			1
the 32 - year - old said : ' there has been so much uproar with the fashion industry not representing ' real ' women i thought idiocies like this had been abolished			0
' i 'm a size eight and this made me feel fat which is just not acceptable			0
' @entity80 , the secretary and co-founder of @entity82 , told @entity83 : ' without doubt the mannequin is not a realistic reflection of a body size and shape			1
' it is outrageous to portray this as acceptable – people may aspire to this body shape whilst people with an eating disorder , may in fact consider themselves not thin enough			1
controversy : @entity3 has come under fire from eating disorder charities for using super slim mannequins ' i really do think the retailers have a duty of care to its shoppers to be more realistic in the size of the model or mannequins that they use to showcase their goods			1
' @entity80 went on to say : ' often people who are low in self - esteem have a false belief that by managing body weight and shape they will be happier , in truth they may plummet to dangerously low levels in weight that may cause them to be medically at risk			0
' people need to be comfortable in the skin they are in – and celebrate the difference in body weight and shape			0
she added : ' promoting clothing in this way can be highly dangerous to potential sufferers of anorexia nervosa			0
' an eating disorder has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health illness with a staggering 20 per cent of people dying each year from their illness or through suicide			1
' manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for their actions and consider the consequences of how this may impact on people suffering from an eating disorders			1
' @entity142 , a part time plus model said : ' i do not think the fuller figure has made its way to high fashion yet which is sad as fuller figured women can be just as stylish as slimmer women			2
' the high street usually means clothes everyone can wear so it ’s disappointing to see this mannequin used by @entity3			1
' skinny shaming is now as bad as fat shaming and as talked about but @entity3 are failing to show a healthy figure			1
' in october student @entity159 posted this image of her friend standing next to a @entity163 mannequin with stick thin legs more women with normal sized legs posed next to the @entity163 mannequin			1
the store said it was not meant to represent a real woman @entity169 has contacted whistles for comment			2
this is not the first time a high street store has come under fire for using a mannequin that is considered too thin			1
in october , @entity163 was slammed for using using mannequins with stick thin legs with student @entity159 sharing a picture of her friend posing comparing her legs to those on the model			1
the image was shared more than 7,000 times			0
a @entity163 spokesman said the mannequin was ‘ based ’ on a size 10			2
‘ the form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus , ’ said the spokesman			2
‘ mannequins are made from fibreglass , so [ they ] need to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed			0
this is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body			0
’ over the last decade , campaigners have been fighting back against a series of fashion and online trends they say encourage eating disorders			2
a row over so - called ' size zero ' models was sparked in 2000 when the @entity208 linked an obsession with ' abnormally thin ' models on tv and in magazines with the rise in conditions such as anorexia and bulimia			2
@entity217 banned models with a body mass index below 18.5 from its catwalks in 2006 in what was seen as a victory for campaigners against size zero			0
but later that year , @entity227 model @entity225 was found dead from a heart attack linked to malnutrition and six months later her sister , model @entity230 , 18 , died in similar circumstances			0
their deaths were used to highlight the pressure on models to meet a demand for unnaturally thin young women			2
campaigners have hit out over the use of ' size zero ' models on catwalks and have linked the desire among women to emulate the so - called ' thigh gaps ' of models like @entity248 ( right ) to eating disorders last year , internet craze ' thinspiration ' - where people post photographs of their emaciated bodies on social media to ' inspire ' weight loss - was also blamed for encouraging eating disorders			2
@entity258 , from charity beat , said : ' those pictures are very unlikely to be real			0
' they are digitally manipulated to make the bodies shown appear extremely emaciated			0
altered pictures of famous people are often included too			0
' a further craze by girls to emulate model 's ' thigh gaps ' erupted earlier this year when experts warned it was further fuelling the issue			0
@entity272 , head of a facility which deals with sufferers in @entity275 , @entity271 said : ' the intrusion and presence of social media in our lives really does make it very difficult			0
' the important distinction about thigh gap is it gives you an actual visual to achieve , this visual comparison of how your body does or does n't stack up			0
