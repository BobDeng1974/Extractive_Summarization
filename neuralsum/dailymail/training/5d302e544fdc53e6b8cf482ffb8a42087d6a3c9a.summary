@entity0 made it two wins from two with an impressive 23 - 13 victory at @entity4 on saturday afternoon to put themselves in a strong position in @entity6			2
@entity8 's try on the stroke of half - time - which gave the visitors a 16 - 3 half - time lead - and then an interception score in the 58th minute from @entity14 saw @entity0 home , with huge performances also from @entity17 and @entity18			0
@entity19 also contributed , with three penalties and two conversions			0
the hosts landed two penalties from @entity24 , who also converted @entity27 's late consolation try , but defeat left @entity4 's bid to make the last eight looking effectively over			1
@entity4 flanker @entity31 and @entity0 number eight @entity17 grapple on the floor at @entity34 @entity36 international openside @entity31 ( left ) feels the full force of @entity0 substitute @entity18 's tackle the @entity39 side had the first scoring opportunity after two minutes , but @entity19 's monster wind - assisted penalty from inside his own half , which came just after @entity44 left the action with a leg injury to be replaced by @entity18 , drifted wide			1
he was on target seven minutes later , though , after @entity4 were penalised at a scrum following a @entity0 break deep in their own territory which had seen @entity51 kick for touch on the full without realising he had run the ball into his own 22			0
this became 6 - 0 on 13 minutes when @entity19 nailed his second penalty after @entity4 were penalised for not releasing , but @entity4 hit back on 20 minutes with @entity24 's first shot at goal after @entity60 was illegally wrapped up in a tackle			1
@entity0 and @entity62 fullback @entity19 fires over a penalty for the @entity39 giants in @entity65 @entity4 then began to exert some territorial squeeze on the @entity68 champions , who then lost fly - half @entity70 to a leg injury after he had cleared from near his own line and @entity74 replaced him			1
then just after the half - hour , @entity0 moved a ball wide at pace from a lineout and @entity19 put @entity14 clear to dive over in the right corner , only for the final pass to be called forward			1
@entity19 made it 9 - 3 with two minutes of the half remaining after @entity4 's scrum again fell foul of referee @entity84 , but the killer blow then came right at the end of the half when @entity8 scorched over in the same corner as @entity17 's earlier disallowed effort			2
@entity0 's @entity14 intercepted a wayward @entity91 pass to race away for a decisive try the @entity93 was consulted but awarded the try which came after @entity0 had injected pace into a sweeping move which went left and right			0
@entity19 nailed a brilliant conversion and the half ended with the visitors leading 16 - 3			0
@entity4 needed to score first after the sides resumed and @entity24 did the necessary on 44 minutes after @entity14 's high hit on @entity103 to narrow the gap to 10 points			2
@entity19 was then wide with a 51st - minute penalty into the wind and then four minutes later @entity24 did the same , before @entity4 's inaccuracy coughed up the game 's decisive score which saw @entity14 intercept a @entity91 pass and run most of the length of the field to dot down under the sticks			1
@entity4 winger @entity27 's try was merely a consolation for the northern province @entity19 's conversion of the 58th - minute try made it 23 - 6 to the @entity39 side , which effectively sealed the result			1
however , @entity4 refused to wilt and , with three minutes remaining , @entity27 swept in for a consolation score after @entity74 had missed touch and @entity125 and @entity126 had countered			0
@entity24 drop - kicked the conversion to narrow the visitors ' lead to 23 - 13 and they saw out the remaining minute without @entity8 , who was yellow - carded for a deliberate knock - on			0
all that remained was @entity135 ' penalty shot from halfway for a losing bonus , but it fell short .			0

@entity62 and @entity140 fullback @entity19 kicks three penalties and adds two conversion for @entity0
@entity27 's try and @entity24 's two penalties not enough for the northern province
@entity0 star @entity44 forced from the field with a leg injury while @entity70 was *withdrawn* from the action after 27 minutes
