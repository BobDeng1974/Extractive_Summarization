by @entity0 @entity2 's controversial mayor @entity1 last night vowed to have another ' crack ' at nixing his city 's land transfer tax at his first campaign debate since leaving rehab			1
the quip provoked raucous laughter from a spirited audience at a church in the @entity2 's @entity13 district , which was split between vocal supporters and opponents of the mayor			0
seeking re-election after a term marred by scandal , including being forced to admit smoking crack cocaine , mr @entity1 faced rival candidates as the race began for october 's municipal poll in earnest			1
@entity2 mayor @entity1 at a campaign debate in @entity13 , @entity27 , last night where he attempted to portray a stellar track record in office as the race begins for the next mayoral election in october ' i have proven in the last 14 years in government that i ’ve watched every single one of your tax dollars , ' said the mayor , to a chorus of cheers and jeers , according to @entity40			1
' i have created jobs , i have worked with youth , nobody ’s worked with youth closer than i have ... folks , my record speaks for itself			0
it ’s a record of success , success , success			0
' mr @entity1 , 45 , only returned to work a fortnight ago after spending two months at the @entity50 rehab centre in @entity51 , @entity27			1
he sought help after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack ; @entity1 admitted last year that he had smoked crack in a ' drunken stupor ' after reports of a similar video , following months of denials			2
even since returning to the mayor 's office , a largely symbolic role after his powers were stripped by the city council , he has admitted that he ca n't guarantee that he 'll never relapse			0
but mr @entity1 's proclivity for crack , a highly addictive derivative of cocaine , seems to have had little impact on his supporters , who booed each time one of his rivals mentioned their man 's drug use			1
supporters dressed in ' @entity77 ' t - shirts , pins and flags heckled his political opponents and yelled in support each time he spoke on stage			0
mayoral contender @entity83 , left , applauds during the debate , where she pointed out that , contrary to mr @entity1 's assertions to have created jobs , one in five young people in the area are out of work mr @entity1 's opponents came armed with sharp barbs , directly contradicting his claims to have looked after public spending and increase employment			1
@entity83 , of the @entity97 , said : ' mr. @entity1 , your record is clear : one out of five young people can not find a job			2
how is it that @entity13 is booming ? ' progressive conservative candidate @entity103 pointed out that two municipal renovations , of @entity105 and @entity106 , had run over budget			0
' project after project after project , on your watch , when you ’re the mayor , ' he was quoted by the @entity114 as saying			0
' we know what you were doing — it was n’t managing the taxpayers ’ money ! ' mr @entity1 's activities while in office have earned him global notoriety , something which mr @entity103 commented on as candidates left the hustings last night			1
' he ’s a laughing stock			0
people all over the world know who @entity1 is , but they know it in a bad way , ' he was quoted by @entity40 as saying .			2

mr @entity1 came back to work a fortnight ago after two months in rehab
mayoral elections are in october , and he is determined to be re-elected
but opponents attack his claims of a stellar track record in office
