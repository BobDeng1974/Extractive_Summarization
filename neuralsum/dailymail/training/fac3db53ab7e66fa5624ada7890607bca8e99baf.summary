the @entity0 to the @entity1 in @entity2 serves as a solemn reminder of the millions of lives lost during the @entity5			1
it also serves as the backdrop for hundreds of gay and bisexual men using the austere grey concrete backdrop as a location to shoot their profile pictures for social app @entity14			1
the images have been collected on the blog ‘ @entity18 , ’ and have caused considerable outrage over the political correctness of the location			0
@entity22 : gay and bisexual men in @entity2 have taken to posting pictures of themselves at the @entity26 , sometimes without shirts and flexing their muscles looking for love : the man on the right wrote : ' i 'm live @entity33 under this shirt			2
gym buddy anyone ? ' the memorial consists of 2,711 concrete slabs , encased on four acres of land in the heart of @entity2 , and is a popular , if not sombre , tourist attraction for hundreds of thousands of people			1
included in that are men on @entity14 trying to find casual hook - ups and make connections			1
men from the site are pictured in various poses – and sometimes shirtless – amid the grey concrete slabs			2
one blogger pictured making a steely glance for the camera wrote on his profile : ‘ remembering those who can not text anymore			2
’ the blog , which was founded by @entity57 and @entity58 , spells out its charter by saying that we live in an age ‘ when ignorance is ( sic ) prevalent than ever , ’ and @entity14 has ‘ wowed its members in relentlessly promoting the memory of the @entity5			1
’ the @entity66 - born blog founders live abroad ; mr @entity67 in @entity2 and mr @entity58 in @entity68 , and told @entity69 that this unlikely tourist attraction became a backdrop for a specific sect of counterculture			0
they explained : ‘ users seem to come from various places and from diverse ethnic backgrounds			2
through the adoption of @entity14 users , the monument gets in our blog a new role ; not only as a space for grief and sadness , but also a site for hope , unity , and cruising			1
’ neither @entity14 nor ' @entity91 's ' founders immediately responded to @entity93 's request for comment			1
on the prowl : many @entity14 users took the opportunity to model their steely poses glamor shot : many of the images look like they could be from magazine editorials @entity14 founder and ceo @entity103 told @entity66 entertainment site @entity69 in 2011 that he ’s not in the least bit offended			1
‘ as a @entity107 and an @entity66 , i ’m deeply moved by how users are coming together as a community on @entity14 to share and inspire others to take part in memory of the @entity5 , ’ he said at the time			1
but according to salon , @entity14 ’s press representatives said the following on wednesday : ‘ what started as users expressing themselves on a topic not often discussed in social networking profiles , has now become disrespectful			1
‘ we strongly encourage our users to engage in a respectful manner and honor the memory of those who perished in outher ways outside of the app. ’ ‘ while the gay community is being under scrutiny for promoting hedonism and alienation , this tribute seems all the more compelling			2
’ never again : flowers lay on a slab of the @entity26 to commemorate the victims of the @entity133 regime at the @entity134 on sunday the 27th remembering : a man stands next to flowers on slabs of the @entity26 on sunday , january 27 @entity138 took a satirical jab at the phenomenon , saying : ‘ the existence of @entity5 memorials like @entity143 in @entity66 and the @entity145 memorial help ( educate and share ) with solemn dignity and introspective reverence			1
‘ naturally , the gays had to come in and make it sexy			0
’ many who saw the photos were outraged			2
‘ i ca n’t put exactly into words why i am insulted , but i am , ’ one commenter wrote on @entity154			0
another wrote : ‘ while i am saddened that people use the denkmal as a place to have fun , it is n’t surprising , and it is n’t going to stop			0
’ but there were others who did not seem so offended by the photos			0
‘ he ’s not going to flex his pecs at @entity168 or at a cancer ward , ’ one commenter wrote on @entity138 ’s website			0
dizzying : the memorial , designed by @entity172 architect @entity171 and consisting of 2,711 columns , is dedicated to the @entity107 victims of @entity133 - era @entity175 outer limits : the memorial is a sombre source of tourism for the city ‘ but like the large stone monoliths of the memorial , he is saying “ f * * * you ” to the persecutors of @entity107 , @entity185 , and gay folk formerly headquartered in that neighborhood			0
’ others simply thought that while these men pictured seemed to display a certain amount of cultural and historical ignorance , they were n’t specifically harming anyone			0
as of march of last year , the site has some 3.5million users spread out in 192 countries			0
the company was founded in 2009			0
now , users send more than 2million photographs to one another on a daily basis			0
the @entity0 to the @entity1 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from @entity93			1
only last week , survivors of the @entity5 gathered at the site to mark @entity205 , placing wreathes and bouquets of flowers on the snow - covered slabs			1
the date , january 27th , was chosen as it in 1945 marked the liberation of @entity168 , the @entity133 ’s most notorious death camp			0
it is estimated that more than 15,000 homosexual men and women were routinely executed during @entity218 ’s reign , with thousands more persecuted for their sexual orientation .			0

@entity221 ' collects pictures of @entity14 users who in turn posted photos of themselves at the @entity226 to the @entity1
