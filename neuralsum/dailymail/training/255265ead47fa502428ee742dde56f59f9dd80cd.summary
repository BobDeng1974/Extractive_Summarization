@entity0 believes his @entity2 side may have ' switched off ' towards the end of their victory over @entity5 as they escaped with a 2 - 1 win			1
the visitors had eased into a two - goal lead at half - time courtesy of an early @entity13 penalty and an @entity15 strike just before the break			1
but @entity5 rallied in the second - half and had @entity2 defending deep - with substitute @entity18 scoring a stoppage - time consolation before cracking a post with the last meaningful touch of the game			1

' we know in the @entity41 that it 's never done , especially at 2 - 0			1
with that ball on the post we were a bit fortunate			0
' we can learn from every game			0
i believe that the players know that maybe they switched off a little bit too early			2
overall i still must say that our central defenders played very well today against a very direct and a very physical game at the back			2

that call should have been made			0
a minute before half - time you 've got to get that call right			2
