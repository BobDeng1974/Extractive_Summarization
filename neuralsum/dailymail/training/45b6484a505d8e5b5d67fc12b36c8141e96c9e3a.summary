by @entity0 when bailiffs turned up to evict a cancer sufferer from his home , they had not counted on one thing – the kindness of strangers			0
in a heartwarming show of support , around 200 people flocked to stop the eviction taking place after owner @entity14 posted a video online begging for help			1
the 63 - year - old promised well - wishers a ‘ lovely cup of tea ’ if they joined his peaceful protest against the loss of the bungalow where he has lived with his wife @entity25 for 25 years			1
and in scenes reminiscent of the 1946 classic film @entity45 ! , supporters from as far afield as @entity40 descended on his three - bedroom home in @entity43 , @entity44 , to help him keep his home			1
after a tense 90 - minute stand - off , the bailiffs left empty - handed			2
mr @entity14 , who is battling prostate cancer , claims he has paid off his mortgage , which he took out with the now defunct @entity52 in 1988			1
but @entity54 @entity53 , charged with winding down @entity52 and @entity56 mortgages , claims he still owes £ 43,000			1
earlier this year a judge ruled against the couple and ordered them to pay off the mortgage or face eviction			1
but the @entity62 claim that these arrears exist due to an error committed by the bank			0
they say they believed they were paying off their mortgage when in fact they were paying only interest			1
in a desperate bid to keep his home , the retired flooring specialist made a heartfelt video explaining his predicament and posted it on @entity76			1
mr and mrs @entity77 bought their three - bedroom bungalow for £ 41,800 in 1988 and raised their family there in the 11 - minute clip , the father - of - three said : ‘ please come and help us			1
there will be a lovely cup of tea waiting for you			0
but do n’t use violence			0
they are the ones who use violence			0
this is a war for the people			2
‘ it may only be a small bungalow , but it is my bungalow , my land , my home			2
’ yesterday , the grandfather - of - two said : ‘ this has been a huge battle for me and at times i ’ve felt like no one wanted to help us			1
' but this shows there are people out there who feel the same way and it has been very emotional to talk to all the people who have come to show support			0
’ mr @entity14 , who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2011 , and his wife , 54 , took out an endowment mortgage to buy the bungalow for £ 41,800 25 years ago			1
they expected to own the property outright when the mortgage came to an end last year			0
mr @entity14 's struggle has echoes of the 1946 film starring @entity125 as a man who faces financial ruin but mr @entity14 claims the bank told him in 2007 that he would never pay off the loan because there was no record of him taking out the endowment , a type of savings plan designed to repay the mortgage debt			1
he then claims a bank manager assured him this was incorrect and even sent his wife flowers and champagne to apologise			0
but soon afterwards he became embroiled in a court battle over the mortgage			0
mr @entity14 added : ‘ they are putting us through hell and something needs to be done about it			2
they ca n’t keep getting away with this			0
’ @entity149 and @entity56 was nationalised in 2008 during the financial crisis , with the main banking section sold to @entity152 while existing mortgages stayed in public control			0
they are now collected by @entity156 , which was set up by the government			0
yesterday , the company confirmed the eviction was called off due to safety concerns			2
on christmas eve @entity161 is desperately troubled his friends and family pray for him and an angel is assigned to help him nothing in @entity161 's life has gone to plan , but he has changed the lives of many his plans to travel the world are put on hold after his father 's death he then takes over his father 's business , but after funds go missing he faces jail @entity161 goes to a bar to drown his sorrows leaving the bar he crashes his car , then walks to a bridge to take his life there he sees the angel , @entity187 , pretending to drown he saves him and @entity187 then shows him what the town would be like without him it is a miserable place and nothing has gone well for his friends and family @entity161 begs to have his life back and rushes home authorities are waiting to arrest him but his friends have repaid the stolen money @entity161 avoids jail and using additional funds given to him he saves the business his brother then declares him the richest man in town and @entity187 gets his wings			2
