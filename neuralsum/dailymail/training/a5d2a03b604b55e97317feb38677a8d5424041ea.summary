a dangerous rescue dog which was on the verge of being put down due to its vicious nature has been saved after it settled down and found love ... with a goose			1
@entity6 the @entity5 was so vicious it would take two people to feed him , one to distract him and the other to throw a bowl of food into his enclosure			0
but his temper changed after @entity14 the goose arrived at the animal sanctuary where he was staying			1
true love : @entity6 was once a snarling @entity5 who could n't be fed by hand but the influence of @entity14 has seen him become placid pooch at first the owners at the @entity24 and @entity25 centre feared @entity6 would attack the bird if it strayed into his territory			1
but the first time they got near one another , their reaction was one of affection more than aggression			0
the pair are now allowed to run free together and even sleep @entity6 's bed every night			1
staff have been surprised by how close they have become and believe the once angry bird and growling dog bring out the softer side in each			2
' it 's so comical to see them because they love each other to bits ' , said @entity46 , who runs the centre near @entity48 , @entity49			1
the pair were initially kept apart at their animal sanctuary , but after being allowed near one another they have now become best friends @entity46 , who runs the @entity24 and @entity25 centre , said : ' it 's so comical to see them because they love each other to bits ' ' she just runs around alongside him all day long and whenever we take him for a walk in the woods she has to come too			1
' they are very affectionate and he 's always licking her head			2
she snuggles into him and they sleep together every night			0
' normally any bird that crossed his path would have been eaten by now , he 's that kind of dog , but not @entity14			1
' i 've been doing rescue work since 1997 and seen all kinds of strange animal behaviour , but i 've never seen anything like this			2
' @entity6 , aged 11 , came to the sanctuary after he was found tethered by a chain in a scrapyard eight years ago			0
both of the animals were rescued from owners who could n't control them , workers at the sanctuary believe they are kindred spirits because there were both so feisty @entity46 added : ' they were going to give him a lethal injection to put him down because he had bitten everybody at his previous shelter and there was nothing they could do with him			0
' they were so scared of him one worker had to distract him at the front of the run while the other threw his food in at the back			0
' but since @entity6 met @entity14 he 's a changed animal			1
' they snuggle down together and @entity6 puts his leg over her to protect her			0
in the morning they have breakfast together			0
it 's really sweet to see them			2
' it used to take two people to feed @entity6 , one to distract him while another put his bowl down			0
but he is a changed dog since meeting @entity14 but not everybody is smitten with the romance and @entity6 's former friend @entity122 , also a @entity5 , is upset after being ousted by the green - eyed goose			1
' @entity14 does n't like @entity122 at all and makes it quite clear that @entity6 is hers ' , said @entity46			1
' she goes on the attack if she comes anywhere near and @entity122 is scared of her			2
' we 've had to give @entity122 lots of cuddles and attention so she does n't feel left out			0

@entity131 was a rescue dog with a *bad* temper
he *refused* to be fed by humans and would attack strangers
but he 's a changed dog after falling in love with @entity14 the goose
