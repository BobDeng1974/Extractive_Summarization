@entity0 will have the usual queue of rivals wanting to swap shirts with him after saturday 's game against @entity6 , even if it costs them 50 euros for the privilege			1
@entity6 's @entity10 striker @entity9 has revealed every time one of the players at the cash - strapped club gives away a shirt at the end of a game they have to pay 50 euros for it because they ca n't afford to keep giving players new jerseys			1
@entity9 fell foul of @entity6 's rule earlier in the season when he swapped with @entity26			1
he says : ' i said to @entity26 : ' can i have your shirt ? ' he said to me : ' of course you can but i want yours in return '			2
it made me proud to think he wanted my shirt			0
i knew i would have to pay 50 euros to replace it but on this occasion i did n't mind			1
@entity0 wo n't be short of @entity6 players lining up for his shirt but will they cough up the cash ? @entity41 are the richest club in the world and have an endless supply of shirts for the @entity46 winner @entity6 striker @entity47 ( left ) and his colleagues have to fork out if they swap too many shirts ' i would like to have a @entity41 shirt after saturday 's game			1
everyone will want to swap with @entity0 and i would love to be the one he exchanges with him but if not then i do n't mind who i swap with be it [ @entity57 ] @entity56 or @entity58			2
@entity41 and @entity60 players have a never ending supply of shirts throughout a season but players from smaller clubs in @entity66 are issued with a limited number and must reimburse the club if they go beyond the limit			2
if @entity9 fails to secure @entity0 's jersey he will settle for one from @entity56 ( left ) or @entity58 ( right ) there will be no problem tomorrow if @entity0 is happy to give his shirt without getting one in exchange but if he wants a swap as @entity26 did then @entity9 will have to cough up again			1
@entity26 has form for making sure he gets a shirt back from anyone he gives one to			0
in his autobiography crossing the line he says : ' i asked a referee for his shirt once			0
he 'd asked for mine , via one of the club officials , and i said : ' okay ... he can have one of mine if i can have one of his			0
' he never sent me it			0
i would like to have had a referee 's shirt to wear on my day off			0
