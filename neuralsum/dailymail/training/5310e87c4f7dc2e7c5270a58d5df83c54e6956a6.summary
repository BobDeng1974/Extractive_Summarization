@entity0 is over the moon that she has managed to drop from a size 18 to a size 8 in just a few months - but her husband will be equally chuffed with his new slimline wife			1
because the star has revealed that she banned her partner from sex after piling on the pounds as an experiment for a new television show , which airs on friday			2
@entity0 went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit			1
she originally weighed 8st 12lb ( right ) but ate her way to 11st 13lb ( left ) , then dropped back down again in just a few months to prove how easy it is to lose the flab but in her heavier months , the 39 - year - old refused to make love to her husband @entity21 because she believes fat people are n't sexy			1
she told @entity23 : ' after i put on my first stone , i stopped having sex with my husband			2
' as a fat bird , i stuck to my pyjamas and getting naked in the dark			2
' a fat belly is not an attractive thing , fat people are n't sexy			2
' @entity0 caused an uproar last year , when she told an obese woman on this morning that she would n't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy			1
but she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project , by gaining and losing 3st for a documentary to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight			2
the weight gain hit @entity0 's emotions harder than she expected , with the mother - of - three often reduced to tears over her size , especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror			1
the documentary ' @entity0 : my fat story ' follows @entity0 as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day , then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise @entity0 told the newspaper that she had n't cried for years , either at the birth of her children or her two weddings , but that gaining 3st ' killed her ' and she often sobbed at how unhealthy she felt during this project			1
previously a slim size eight , weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in , the 39 - year - old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement			1
with an apparently naturally high metabolism , @entity0 struggles to bring her weight up over 11st despite her high - calorie intake			1
the documentary sees her draft in ex-army personal trainer @entity71 who devises a military style program of what he terms ' circuit eating ' to help her gain the final pounds			2
diving a table into four , @entity71 places different foods in each section and makes @entity0 rotate the table six times , eating the small but high calorie foods at each point			1
similar in form to exercise circuits , the idea is to maximize calorie intake , and the circuits have to be repeated every two hours			2
@entity0 refused to be intimate with husband @entity21 , pictured , after she gained a stone in weight after one particular feed , clearly uncomfortable with a distended stomach , @entity0 rants : ' it is just ridiculous what people do to themselves			1
fat people , i mean really i do n't know how they look at themselves in the mirror			0
' having reached 11st 13lb , with a 38in waist and a @entity102 of 26 , the documentary @entity0 : my @entity103 , which is due to air on @entity104 this friday and saturday , then follows @entity0 as she loses the weight on a strict diet and exercise regime			1
in the @entity104 documentary , we see the usually polished star in her unguarded moments			0
make - up free and in a pair of stripped pyjamas , @entity0 breaks down over her larger body			1
after a weight - gain diet that included daily ' snacks ' of a litre - and - a - half of @entity118 milk drink , an entire tub of @entity120 , cheese on toast , @entity123 and @entity125 chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast , @entity0 then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500			1
as well as a low fat diet of porridge , salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato , @entity0 upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour - long runs a week			1
following this self - devised plan she managed to drop down to 9st 12lb in just three months , shedding a further 6lb after the documentary ended			1
the controversial figure claims that while she did n't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children , gaining 3st ' killed her ' and left her in constant floods @entity0 kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her strong views on fat people			2
one video sees her explaining : ' one of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you do n't want to go out so much			0
you feel like you do n't really want to go out because you ca n't fit into the things you would like to wear			0
' i 'm not sure if that 's something many fat people suffer from because i see a lot of fat people out and about			0
whether that 's out of choice i do n't know but i 'm surprised that fat people go out at all			0
' the former @entity162 contestant , turned columnist said in the @entity23 : ' i think i have proved there are no excuses to be overweight , but i 've also shown that it affects you more than physically			0
' i still would n't employ a fat person after living a fat life			0
' being fat is hard work			0
you ca n't be fat and happy			0
if you 're too lazy to make a change then you 're going to be fat			0
' but despite the hardships that she suffered after gaining weight , @entity0 maintains that she still would n't employ a fat person			1
she also suggested a radical weight - loss scheme in her interview with @entity23 , which would see children weighed at the school gates			2
the fattest 10 per cent of children would then be reported to social services			0
the controversial former reality star has been as active as usual on @entity185 , defending her views on being overweight @entity0 first embarked on the weight - gain and weight - loss scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size			1
speaking on @entity193 's @entity192 in september she said : ' one in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are 15 or over are overweight or obese			0
' people have always said to me , " you 're lucky , you 're skinny , " and i just do n't think these excuses are cutting it any more			0
' i saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat			0
i just thought , we have to put an end to this			0
' while she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues , @entity0 is continuing to be outspoken on the topics , using her @entity185 account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood			1
she recently tweeted : ' my local over / under active thyroid self help group meets in @entity220			0
' she also posted : ' i see you all down there with your excuses , but a third of the planet is obese			0
the first step to slim is no excuses			0
' @entity0 : my @entity103 , airs friday and saturday , 2 and 3 january at 9pm on @entity104 .			2

@entity0 went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb in just a few months
after putting on her first stone , she refused to get dressed with light on
she has now lost the weight again and documented it for a tv show
