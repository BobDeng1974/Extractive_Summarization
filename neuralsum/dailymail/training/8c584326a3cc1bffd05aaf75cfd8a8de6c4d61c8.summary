@entity1 's @entity0 claimed the halfway lead in the @entity3 on friday as the luck of the draw had a major impact			1
@entity7 carded a second round of 70 in the pro-am event to finish nine under par , one shot ahead of @entity14 duo @entity13 and @entity15 , @entity17 's @entity16 and @entity1 's @entity18			1
eleven of the top 12 scores came from players who were at @entity22 on friday and @entity23 on thursday , when calm conditions meant traditionally the hardest of the three venues played relatively easy			1
@entity0 claims halfway lead at @entity3 on nine - under - par @entity28 is five behind @entity7 after 36 holes of the pro-am tournament in @entity31 wind and rain made scoring more difficult on friday but @entity7 birdied his final two holes to move into pole position for a fifth @entity37 title			1
' i 'm pretty happy , especially the way i finished , ' said @entity7 , whose last win came in a record - equalling nine - hole play - off in the @entity42 last year			1
' i birdied 17 and 18 so it was good before having dinner and going to rest			2
' i 've been working hard every year since the last 20 years to be at this position			0
it 's a long weekend			0
it 's a lot of golf to play , so you know , the game of golf , it 's not that easy			0
you just have to stick to the same plan and see what happens			0
' @entity13 , who finished joint third in this event 12 months ago , was the only player in the top 12 to play at @entity57 on friday , meaning he will face @entity23 on saturday before the final round is again played over the @entity59			1
' to be honest , the way i played to shoot two under was quite good , ' said @entity13 after a round containing four bogeys and six birdies			1
' the forecast was pretty bad today and everyone was expecting the worst , but it was n't actually that bad			0
' it played quite easy toward the end and i could have picked up a couple more , but i 'm happy with the position i 'm in with two rounds to go			2
hopefully i can go out to @entity23 tomorrow and hopefully the weather is not too bad over there and i can shoot a decent score			2
' @entity15 won the first of his back - to - back @entity42 titles at @entity23 in 2007 but has not won a tournament on a major worldwide tour since the 2008 @entity81 @entity80			1
the four - time major winner ( right ) finished his round strongly to give him an outside chance of victory the 43 - year - old was a vice-captain at last week 's @entity87 and although he admits he has a lot more to learn before bidding to captain the side , he has set himself an ambitious target			2
' i think the big one for me , i 've got to get inside the top 15 in the world to make the @entity93 in 2016 , ' said @entity15 , who is currently ranked 324th			2
' i 've got 22 months to go			0
i 'm starting at absolute zero probably at the moment			0
' i really feel good about my game , so i believe i can do it			0
' @entity31 duo @entity98 and @entity99 are two shots off the pace on seven under , with compatriot @entity102 another shot back and @entity102 's @entity87 team - mate @entity28 five off the lead on four under			1
@entity7 has benefitted from having a favourable draw in nice conditions at @entity23 and @entity22 @entity28 , who is keen to make the cut in the team event so his amateur partner , his father @entity110 , can play at @entity57 on his 55th birthday this sunday , started the day nine shots off the pace and dropped back to two over par with a bogey on the 14th			1
however , the world number one responded in style with a superb fairway - wood approach to the par five 16th and rolled in the eagle putt from 15 feet on his way to a round of 67 at @entity22			1
' i think the eagle on 16 kickstarted something for me , ' the 25 - year - old said			2
' i just went from there , started to knock a few putts in			0
i felt like i struck the ball pretty well for the first couple of days , but just to see a few putts roll in sort of gave me a little bit of confidence and played well after that			0
' it would mean an awful lot to win at @entity57			0
but if i did n't , i would n't mind waiting until july next year			0
' that is when the @entity137 will defend his @entity42 title			0
the @entity1 ( third right ) takes his shot on the par - four 18th hole as the sun sets at @entity22			1

@entity0 leads @entity3 by a shot after second round
he lies one shot ahead of @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 who sit on eight - under - par at the pro-am event
an amazing 11 of the top 12 scores came from the @entity22 course
those scores also came from @entity23 on thursday to add luck to draw
@entity7 birdied final two holes as he bids for fifth @entity37 title
@entity28 five behind the lead score on four - under - par after two rounds
