cancel your plans to journey through the centre of @entity4 or , at least , adjust your arrival time at the other side			1
research has found that it would only take a person 38 minutes to make it from one side of the planet to the other - not 42 minutes , as previously calculated			1
the hypothetical scenario finds that when the different densities of @entity4 ’s layers are taken into account , the trip is four minutes shorter than predicted			1
a student from @entity19 in @entity20 examined the hypothetical scenario of falling through @entity4 ( graphic shown )			1
originally it was thought the journey from one side to the other			1
when @entity4 's density is considered , the new estimate is 38 minutes and 11 seconds the latest time estimate was calculated by @entity30 , a graduate student of physics at @entity19 in @entity32 , @entity20 and published in @entity33			1
‘ this was a bit of a surprise to me , ’ mr @entity30 told @entity34			2
theoretically speaking , as a person falls through @entity4 , gravity is constantly changing as they make their way to the middle			2
consequently they would speed up as they approached the centre , and begin to slow down again as they made their way to the other side			0
ignoring drag effects due to the presence of air , it would take exactly the same amount of time to make the journey either side of the core			2
under these conditions , the speed reached during the descent would be enough for to reach the surface on the other side			0
@entity4 ’s density is less than 2,200lbs ( 1,000kg ) per cubic metre at the surface , but 28,700 lbs ( 13,000kg ) per cubic metre at the core - 3,960 miles ( 6,370km ) below			2
and 2,200 miles ( 3,500km ) from the centre , about half way , there is also a dramatic jump in density near the outer core			0
using these numbers it would take 38 minutes 11 seconds to fall through @entity4 - four minutes and a second quicker than thought			1
‘ basically , the way the @entity4 is structured , the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core , to about 110 per cent of its surface value , before getting weaker as you move through the core , reaching zero [ per cent ] at the centre			0
the original theory goes like this : if a hole was dug from one point on @entity4 to the other on the opposite side , it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through			1
for example , if a person fell from @entity93 to the @entity94 - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take that long to travel the whole way			1
of course , they 'd need some sort of tunnel that could survive the intense heat and pressure inside @entity4 , and their body would also need to be able to survive the conditions			0
plus handle a top speed of 18,000 mph ( 29,000 km / h )			0
theoretically speaking , as a person falls through @entity4 , gravity is constantly changing as they make their way to the middle			2
consequently they would speed up as they approached the centre , and begin to slow down again as they made their way to the other side			0
ignoring drag effects due to the presence of air , it would take exactly the same amount of time to make the journey either side of the core			0
the original theory goes like this : if a hole was dug from one point on @entity4 to the other on the opposite side , it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through - but the new estimate is four minutes and eleven seconds quicker			1
shown is a promotional @entity137 photo of @entity138 as you fall through @entity4 ( interior shown in illustration on the left ) , gravity is constantly changing as you make your way to the middle			2
so , you would speed up as you approached the centre ( illustrated right ) , and begin to slow down again as you made your way to the other side wish you were here ? if you fell from @entity93 ( left ) to the @entity94 ( right ) - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take 38 minutes and 11 seconds to make the journey last week it was announced a new ' superviscous ' layer in @entity4 ’s lower mantle had been discovered			1
the breakthrough could explain why parts of @entity4 ’s sinking tectonic plates sometimes stall and thicken 930 miles ( 1,500km ) underground			0
it could also explain why earthquakes occur deep inside the @entity4 ’s interior , suggesting it is hotter than previously thought			2
the research was carried out by scientists at the @entity167 by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in @entity4 's interior			1
this new layer extends from 410 miles ( 660km ) underground to 930 miles ( 1,500km )			0
in the layer , liquids are under such intense pressure that they are extremely stiff - known as superviscosity			0
under these conditions , the speed reached during the descent would be enough for to reach the surface on the other side			0
but mr @entity30 said previous calculations did not take into account the densities of @entity4 ’s layers			1
for example , research has shown that the planet is much denser at its centre than at the crust , near the surface			0
using seismic data , he found that @entity4 ’s densiity was less than 2,200lbs ( 1,000kg ) per cubic metre at the surface , but 28,700 lbs ( 13,000kg ) per cubic metre at the core - 3,960 miles ( 6,370km ) below			2
and 2,200 miles ( 3,500km ) from the centre , about half way , there is also a dramatic jump in density near the outer core			0
using these new numbers in , mr @entity30 found that the time to fall through @entity4 was actually 38 minutes and 11 seconds - four minutes and a second quicker than thought			1
the same is true if a person was to fall between any two points on @entity4 .			0

originally it was thought the journey from one side of the @entity4 to the other - such as @entity93 to @entity94 - would take 42 minutes
it examines the hypothetical scenario of falling through @entity4
but student claims this does *n't* take into account @entity4 's changing density
@entity30 from @entity19 has published a new estimate
he claims the journey would actually take 38 minutes and 11 seconds
