former world 400m hurdles champion @entity0 has said it is ' disappointing ' all @entity3 medallists will not automatically be drug - tested , and insisted his fellow @entity5 @entity4 and @entity6 are not ' deliberate cheaters '			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) has adopted a ' quality over quantity ' approach to anti-doping measures in @entity13 , with specific sports being targeted instead of asking all medallists to provide urine or blood samples			1
' i am surprised by that , ' said @entity0			1
' you ca n't test enough , really			2
for everyone to be tested is the way forward , in my mind , and our sport will become cleaner because of more testing i think			2
' not good enough : @entity28 could n't make it through in his @entity3 400m hurdles heat trailing : @entity0 was disappointed but said he already knew he may not have been good enough banned : @entity4 , @entity0 's former housemate , was not able to take his place in @entity13 dragon : fellow @entity5 @entity6 , who @entity0 admits not seeing eye - to - eye to , is also banned @entity0 's former housemate @entity4 , 32 , and @entity6 , 30 , were both suspended from the @entity34 team after testing positive for banned substances before the @entity3 began			1
the exact nature of the drugs involved have not been disclosed , but the pair use the same range of supplements , @entity41 , which are not listed on the @entity43 website , either in the list of registered or batch - tested products			2
athletes are urged to cross-check this website for accredited supplements that should be safe and legal for them to use , although the resource still does not offer a 100 per cent guarantee			2
@entity0 said : ' when @entity52 found out he texted me and i was really quite upset about it because i know @entity52 and lived with him for a few years			1
he ’s not that kind of guy			2
' he lived off raisins and cous cous because he could n't afford anything else , so i do n't think he 's organising a drugs ring			1
' hopefully they can get to the bottom of things and find things out because i do believe that they are not deliberate cheaters			1
they have probably just been careless or misled slightly			0
that will come out eventually i ’m sure			0
' even though me and @entity6 do n’t really get on , i know he ’s not the sort of person to deliberately cheat			1
i do n’t think anybody in the @entity72 or @entity74 team honestly believes they have gone out of their way to cheat			0
i ’ve not known anyone who has been in their situation before so it was a big shock for me			0
' it ’s just unfortunate but as professional athletes we ’ve got to learnt not to take anything that is n’t batch tested			0
hopefully other people will learn from it			0
' lagging : @entity0 fell away after a decent start to his @entity3 title defence @entity4 and @entity6 , who both deny ' knowingly taking any banned substances ' have been suspended from all competition pending the outcome of their appeals , which will not take place until september at the earliest			1
@entity0 said he expected any ban to extend into next season , but advised his @entity34 team - mates had already been punished enough by missing the @entity3 and next month 's @entity102			1
the 28 - year - old added : ' there ’s bound to be a punishment because you ca n’t get away with having steroids or whatever else in your system			2
but , hopefully they will look at the situation			0
strange behaviour : one of the reason 's @entity0 says @entity4 ca n't be a drugs cheat was his diet - the 800m runner apparently lived off a diet of raisins and cous cous ' they ’ve already been punished quite severely in terms of missing the @entity121 – they will be too old at the next one to be in any shape so that ’s a massive knock			1
' they had ambitions to be at the @entity127 as well so that ’s two championships they are going to miss. the ban they will probably get will go into next season as well so they will get punished for it			0
' they have n’t deliberately taken anything but they will be punished for it			0
i ca n’t imagine being in that situation			0
hopefully they can come back from this as stronger athletes and continue their careers because they are past 30 now			0
i do feel sorry for them in that regard			0
' disappointment : @entity72 hurdler @entity6 missed out on the games after an anti-doping violation last week			1

@entity5 ays there are not enough drugs tests in sport
the @entity8 are targeting specific sports only
@entity0 's former housemate @entity4 , and @entity6 are both banned
former world champions is confident neither are deliberate cheaters
he says @entity4 ' lived off raisins and cous cous '
wants their punishment already dealt out to be considered in any case
