theoretical neurobiologist @entity10 , and philosopher @entity11 , have both spent more time contemplating the issue than most			1
in an interview with io9 , the pair explained the problems			0
they believe that excessive amounts of intelligence could have negative consequences for the person , causing maladaptation , anti-social behaviour , and even psychosis			1
sci - fi has long been fascinated by the idea of creating a race of people with super intelligence ( such as mr @entity29 from @entity30 ) , but two experts have now argued that this would not prove to be a good thing their findings come at a time when people are obsessed with intelligence , iq , and the pursuit of endless knowledge			1
they also believe that the concept is difficult as intelligence is hard to define and factors such as morals and empathy could be overlooked			0
mr @entity11 explained to io9 : ' @entity47 , when they say that intelligence ought to be enhanced , almost never mean some kind of social intelligence			1
' they rarely talk about other forms of intelligence , like enhanced empathy , or understanding what it means to promote another person 's well - being			0
' he added : ' just because you have intelligence in the @entity63 sense does n't necessarily mean you have a universal instrument to help you get everything else you want in your life			0
' mr @entity10 explained that the issue is how we define intelligence - and therefore , what we mean when we say that we would like to create people with superhuman intelligence			1
he believes that people tend to think of intelligence as something that the human brain is not particularly good at - for example , being able to play chess , or solve logic problems			2
he went on to explain that things people are naturally good at , such as things that come instinctively , we do not see as part of our intelligence			2
they believe that being extremely clever ( like @entity85 ) could have negative consequences for the person , causing maladaptation , anti-social behaviour , and even psychosis he told io9 that people are not aware of their brain doing these things , so do not tend to view them as connected to intelligence			1
mr @entity11 agrees that people tend to have too simplistic a view of intelligence			1
he says that people who try to turn intelligence into a narrow category are oversimplifying it			2
for example , he notes that there are people who are really good at solving mathematical problems but who are almost incapable of stringing a sentence together			0
the experts believe intelligence is hard to define and factors such as morals and empathy could be overlooked			0
@entity113 from @entity114 is known for being very intelligent but lacking emotion he worries that if people were give superhuman intelligence , it would be almost impossible to enhance all of the areas that could constitute intelligence			2
he argues that because everyone values different areas of intelligence , if everyone boosted the area of intelligence that they consider to be important , it would result in worse outcomes			2
for example , mr @entity11 worries that people might end up amazingly good at something like maths , but totally lacking in emotional or moral intelligence			1
this , he believes , could result in people using their talents for evil			0
as a result , he thinks the only way that it could work would be to boost intelligence at the same rate as self - reflection and modesty			0
mr @entity11 is also concerned that because the human brain is not designed to be super intelligent , it might respond to boosting by becoming maladjusted or even psychotic			0
the experts believe that there could , however , be solutions			0
mr @entity10 believes that the way to make people brilliant is to harness the brain 's natural instincts			1
he believes that in the future it will be more important to people to be able to enhance these factors to allow us , for example , to navigate new places , than to enhance the sort of intelligence that related to things like maths			0
in contrast , mr @entity11 believes that the most valuable thing would be to boost people 's ability to be happy			1
he thinks that people who are happy are more successful in a wide range of areas , such as in their relationships , their work and their social lives .			0

theoretical neurobiologist @entity10 , and philosopher @entity11 say we are obsessed with *achieving* ever greater intelligence
but they warn it could lead to anti-social behaviour and psychosis
say that if people become extremely clever but their moral intelligence is not boosted as well , they could use their powers for evil
