one of @entity1 's main railway stations was evacuated this morning when a fire broke out on a train			1
passengers were ordered to leave @entity5 after a ' screech and a bang ' around the front carriage of the 10.55am departure to @entity10 , @entity11 , after it pulled into platform six			1
five fire engines were sent to the scene as passengers screamed and ran for the exit amid false reports of a bomb			2
no one was hurt , despite the driver being in the cab at the time			0
marketing worker @entity39 , 22 , was waiting for a train to @entity41 when he heard what sounded like an explosion			1
mr @entity39 said it appeared the train may have hit the buffers - though this claim was flatly denied by rail operator @entity48 , which said the cause was an electrical fault			1
he told @entity51 : ' i was sitting on the platform and there was this loud screech and a big bang			1
@entity57 went everywhere and a few people were screaming			0
' it looked like a train had n't braked properly and had gone into the big buffer at the end of the track			2
' people were jogging quite calmly to the exit and the alarms were going off			0
i was outside when the first police car came and told everyone to move away			0
one witness told @entity51 : ' i was sitting on the platform and there was this loud screech and a big bang ' another witness said : ' there were quite a lot of flames and flashing lights as well			1
people were just all running out of there ... they tried to stay calm but there were definitely people running ' ' i did n't see anyone hurt but there was a big bang and it was still on fire afterwards			1
it looked as though the fire was more on the platform and the building around it than the actual locomotive			2
' the staff were clearing everyone out very quickly so it hit people more when they got outside the station and everyone was like " woah "			2
there was one woman who looked really shaken up			0
' @entity102 , 60 , and her son @entity103 , 26 , were on the train to travel to @entity105 in @entity106 when the fire started			1
ms @entity102 said : ' suddenly the doors burst open and a woman ran through shouting " there 's a bomb on the train , everybody get off "			2
' we ran away towards the opposite end of the station because i thought that if there was a bomb , they 'd probably take out the concourse			2
' but the staff kept saying to us come back in and we really did n't want to come back through the station , because by then there was thick smoke			1
' we were marshalled out here and told that it 'd be closed for a very long time , and then the emergency services turned up			0
' where the fire was there were big bangs and pops and flashes			2
and the smoke , the smoke was the worst thing			2
' mr @entity137 added : ' there was fire and lots of thick smoke , so we assumed that there was a bomb ripping through the train			1
' people were running through the train , and my first thought was the reason they 're running down the train is because they ca n't get off			2
' no - one really knew what was going on			0
' they left their possessions and ms @entity102 ' coat on the train , and the police retrieved them for her			2

that 's being investigated right now by engineers on site			0
