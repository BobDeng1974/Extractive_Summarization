by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's season went from bad to worse on sunday when defender @entity4 was punched and kicked by the club 's fans as he left the stadium after a 4 - 0 defeat by @entity9 that left the @entity11 club bottom of the @entity13 first division			1
local media reported that the left back was hit in the face as he left @entity7 in @entity18			0
angry fans also kicked him as he sought refuge in the van that was picking him up outside the dressing rooms , according to the reports			0
that anger boiled over on sunday as @entity3 lost again to find themselves rooted to the bottom of the league with just seven points from 11 games			1
the @entity11 club had @entity46 sent off in the first half and were no match for an @entity9 side who are now one of five clubs with 19 points , six behind leaders @entity54			2
corinthians are in second on 20 after getting a point in a drab 0 - 0 draw away at @entity58			1
@entity54 are the only team in the top half of the table to win both their games since the @entity62 break and their 2 - 1 victory at @entity64 on sunday meant they extended their lead at the top of the table to five points			0
flop : @entity4 endured an unhappy spell with @entity37 before returning to play in his native @entity36 @entity71 got a goal after seven minutes and @entity73 headed home another three minutes later			1
@entity64 got one back after eight minutes of the second period through @entity77 but could not grab what would have been a deserved equaliser			0
the other big winners were newly promoted @entity81 , who came to @entity83 on saturday and beat the home side 1 - 0 in front of 43,075 fans , the biggest crowd of the weekend			2
@entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 also won .			0

@entity3 lost 4 - 0 to @entity9 on sunday to leave them bottom of the @entity13 first division
@entity4 was kicked and punched as he left the stadium according to reports
the former @entity37 defender has failed to impress since *joining* the club
