@entity0 has revealed a huge new gully on the @entity2 - and says it formed in just three years			1
the @entity3 snapped the area in 2010 and 2013 - and today revealed the before and after images that show the gully appearing			1
they say it was probably formed by carbon - dioxide frost			1
drag the slider bar below to see the before and after pictures since its arrival in orbit in 2006 , @entity3 and its @entity11 ( @entity11 ) telescope have been mapping the martian surface			1
it completed its primary science phase in 2008 and continues investigations of @entity19 ' surface , subsurface and atmosphere			0
the orbiter sports a dish antenna 10 feet in diameter and uses it to pour data earthward at up to 6 megabits per second			0
it has a number of instruments including three cameras - one of which is @entity11 , a spectrometer for identifying minerals , a ground - penetrating radar and an atmosphere sounder			2
gully or ravine landforms are common on @entity19 , particularly in the southern highlands , ' @entity0 said			0
' this pair of images shows that material flowing down from an alcove at the head of a gully broke out of an older route and eroded a new channel			0
' the dates of the images are more than a full @entity19 year apart , so the observations did not pin down the @entity19 season of the activity at this site			0
before - and - after @entity11 pairs of similar activity at other sites demonstrate that this type of activity generally occurs in winter , at temperatures so cold that carbon dioxide , rather than water , is likely to play the key role , the team believe			1
the area is home to several large gullies and channels @entity3 has observed other @entity19 features that do seem associated with liquid water â€” dark streaks known as recurring slope lineae , for instance			1
since its arrival in orbit in 2006 , @entity3 and its @entity11 ( @entity11 ) telescope have been mapping the martian surface			2
the @entity11 team released preliminary , black - and - white images in march of that year , and have since collected hundreds more			2
this pair of before ( left ) and after ( right ) images from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) camera on @entity0 's @entity3 show the new gully forming on a @entity19 slope between nov. 5 , 2010 , and may 25 , 2013			1
since 2006 , the @entity3 has been charting the red planet 's terrain			2
this image shows defrosting of the crests of ' @entity85 '			0
this is the informal name given to a set of intersecting ridges that are located among the layered materials of the south polar region of @entity19			0
their origin has never been understood			0

believed it was formed by carbon - dioxide frost
