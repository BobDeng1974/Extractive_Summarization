crime scene investigators can tell what a criminal ate and drank before they committed a crime , thanks to pioneering fingerprint technology			1
the equipment can detect certain food and drink , such as garlic and coffee , as well as work out if a criminal has taken drugs			2
scientists have already used the tool to determine the sex of a criminal and are now working on it being able to test for medical conditions			2
the @entity21 powder produces similar results to technology recently developed by researchers from @entity25			0
their microscopic technology is called @entity28 ( @entity29 ) ( pictured ) and it traces drugs , hair and cleaning products in fingerprints a fingermark is made up of material from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions			1
conventionally , fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted , often using a powder , and are compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect			2
the new technology uses @entity29 - @entity29 to produce multiple images of fingermarks that can provide extra information on a suspect			1
these details can be important background information in a criminal investigation , especially if the suspect 's fingerprint is not on the police database and a positive @entity56 can not be made			0
they could also use it to tell the police how long a fingerprint has been at the crime scene			1
the microscopic technology is called @entity28 ( @entity29 ) and it traces drugs , hair and cleaning products in fingerprints			1
it has been developed by researchers at @entity69 ’s @entity68 ( @entity70 )			0
the researchers are working with @entity72 , who are trialling the technology on fingerprints left at scenes of crime			1
dr @entity78 , who led the research , said : ‘ @entity29 enables you to detect the chemistry of the finger marks so essentially what chemicals are present on finger marks			2
‘ what we can do with the technology is detect multiple species in one analysis			2
’ scientists have already used the tool to determine the sex of a criminal and are now working on it being able to test for medical conditions			0
here , dr @entity78 uses mass spectrometry to analyse a fingerprint speaking about an example fingerprint , she explained : ‘ we found the presence of cocaine in traces , we also found the presence of cocaine metabolite , that is very good because it actually tells us immediately the person who left the mark has not just touched cocaine but actually ingested it			0
‘ so that changes the forensic scenario very quickly			0
with food , i ’ve tried that on my own fingerprints , i ’ve drunk a cup of coffee , then looked at my own finger marks at a certain time , after ten minutes , and could see a very clear signal for caffeine			2
‘ we can tell not just what you ’ve touched but what ’s coming out through your body and through the sweat			0
the technology can detect food and drink , such as garlic and coffee , from fingerprints ( pictured ) ‘ we ’ve started with looking at determining the sex of offenders through the unique chemistry of the finger marks and one of our biggest ambitions is to look at medical conditions , again from unique chemicals that are present through finger marks			1
’ dr @entity78 explained that because meals are made up of such complex components , it might not ever be possible to say , for example , that person ate meatballs for dinner			0
‘ but things like garlic , which have strong chemical components , we might be able to detect			0
‘ it ’s really interesting and who knows what we may be able to tell in the future			0
’ @entity156 - @entity29 , which is a powerful technology normally used to map different molecules within tissue sections , produces multiple images of fingerprints which are made up of materials from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions			1
conventionally , fingerprints found at the scene of a crime are lifted after using a powder to enhance them , and are then compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect			1
the research team also discovered that the cooking spice , turmeric can be used as the powder to lift finger marks within the @entity29 - @entity29 process			1
dr @entity78 said : ‘ our collaboration with @entity72 takes us one step closer to our aim of getting @entity29 - @entity29 integrated into standard forensic procedures at scenes of crime up and down the country			1
‘ it is a valuable opportunity to be able to gather authentic evidence that demonstrates the efficiency of @entity29 - @entity29 to be used in order to provide additional intelligence to the investigators in real casework			1
’ @entity72 ’s @entity193 , @entity194 said : ‘ this research presents an exciting opportunity to enhance fingerprint capability beyond just identification			0
‘ we may soon be able to accurately age finger marks and by analysing the constituent parts of the finger impression , profile the habits of the offender			0

@entity205 can detect food , drink and drugs in fingerprints
it has already been used to determine the sex of criminals from their marks
the @entity29 - @entity29 technology is being trialled by @entity72
it could one *day* tell police how long prints have been at a crime scene
