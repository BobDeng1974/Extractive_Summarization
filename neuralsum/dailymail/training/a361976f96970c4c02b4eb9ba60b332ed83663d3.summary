the @entity1 board will face the wrath of the @entity4 support when it appears before the club 's @entity5 on monday			1
the shareholder summit takes place at the home of the @entity11 giants at 10.30am and is certain to be a stormy affair			2
chairman @entity13 , new chief executive @entity14 and director @entity15 all face re-election to the board			2
the @entity1 hierarchy , including @entity18 ( second left ) stand at last year 's agm at @entity4 @entity13 ( right ) is facing re-election to the board at the @entity5 on monday morning but with @entity15 's brother @entity0 chairman - in control of a quarter of the club 's shares and also aligned with investor @entity25 , that should be a mere formality			1
however , with the club no nearer to financial security than they were when the directors were booed and heckled prior to last year 's @entity5 , they will be under pressure to explain how they plan on saving the club from another collapse			2
in the time since that last explosive agm , @entity25 has grabbed control of the club , forcing both chief executive @entity40 and director @entity41 to quit			1
the @entity43 owner - who holds an 8.92 per cent stake in the @entity11 giants - is now pulling the strings from behind			2
it is unclear whether @entity1 manager @entity18 will be in attendance at the meeting at @entity4 @entity14 has been appointed as the non-executive director at @entity1 the £ 3million loan he handed the club gave him the right to hand - pick two directors and so far he has installed @entity55 onto the board and ordered chairman @entity13 to appoint him @entity40 's successor as chief executive			1
but @entity1 are still dangerously short of cash and need £ 8.3million before april 1 just to stay afloat			0
according to reports , billionaire @entity60 tycoon @entity25 is ready to underwrite a share issue which could prove the answer to the club 's cash crisis - but that will only land the club in further hot water with the @entity70			1
@entity72 chiefs have already handed @entity1 and @entity25 a notice of complaint as they investigate the ' dual ownership ' aspect of the @entity79 owner 's @entity4 involvement			1
@entity1 beat @entity80 2 - 0 at @entity4 on saturday , with @entity81 opened the scoring @entity83 ( left ) celebrates with manager @entity18 , who has tendered his resignation at the @entity11 outfit the meeting could also prove uncomfortable for boss @entity18 , should he decide to attend			1
the 52 - year - old has handed in his notice to resign and is now working the final 12 months of his @entity1 reign			0
but he will face probing questions from shareholders after his team allowed @entity94 to build a commanding nine - point lead in the @entity97 title race			0
there was some light relief for @entity18 on saturday as his team beat @entity80 2 - 0 thanks to @entity81 's early strike and @entity103 's own goal a quarter of an hour from the end			2
@entity18 barks instructions at his players , but his @entity1 future is in doubt after he tendered his resignation but @entity81 said : ' we just got on with training and did n't really pay too much attention to what was happening			1
' we 're here to play good football and hopefully if we can keep doing that it 'll make the fans more happy			0
' getting the three points here takes that wee monkey off our backs and hopefully we can carry that on to the game at the weekend			0
@entity25 ( centre ) and @entity123 ( right ) watch on at a @entity43 game - both are now involved at @entity1 @entity83 ( left ) celebrates after putting @entity1 1 - 0 up against @entity80 at @entity4 on saturday afternoon ' the gaffer has n't really said anything to us			1
at the end of the day whatever happens with him , he can sort out himself			0
he 's a big enough man , we 're just here to play football and the players can only go out and do their best on the pitch			0
' we can not influence what happens up in the boardroom			0
' but the manager is here at the moment so all we can do is take things as they come			0
if that changes we need to deal with it but as things stand the gaffer is the gaffer			0

*rangers* have their @entity5 at @entity4 at 10.30am on monday
the board will face the wrath of the angry @entity4 support at the meeting
since the last agm , @entity25 has grabbed control of the @entity11 club
it is unclear whether @entity18 will attend - he tendered his resignation as manager last week , but was in charge at the weekend
