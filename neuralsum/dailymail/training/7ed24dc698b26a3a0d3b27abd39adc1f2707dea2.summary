' teleporting ' physical objects over distances instantaneously - like the transporter in @entity3 - has been brought a step closer thanks to a new prototype that uses a 3d printer			1
the device , dubbed ' @entity9 ' , digitises an object in one place , destroying it in the process , and rebuilds it in another location			1
named after the operator of the transporter in the hit sci - fi tv series , @entity9 scans an object layer by layer and sends its encrypted digital blueprint to a 3d printer for it to be reassembled			1
' @entity9 is a simple self - contained appliance that allows teleporting inanimate physical objects across distance , ' said the researchers , who are based in the @entity42 in @entity43			1
the original object is destroyed in order to preserve its ' uniqueness ' , rather than simply copying it			1
this enhances the emotional value of physical objects shared between friends , according to the researchers , as the transported item is no longer just a copy , but the only version in existence			2
a hand crafted pendant is dipped in black paint to increase the contrast for the digital scan before being placed into @entity9			1
the sender presses a single button to initiate the ' teleportation ' process @entity9 uses a digital camera to scan the item , before shaving off a layer using a built - in milling machine			1
it then repeats the process , until the original is destroyed			2
but as it slices and scans on one end , the layers are sent via encrypted connection to the 3d printer at the item 's destination , where it is rebuilt by ' printing ' the layers in plastic			1
so far @entity9 can only ' teleport ' one type of material - plastic - so we are still a long way from beaming ourselves to other planets			2
but in destroying the original , @entity9 also attempts to solve another tricky problem			1
the device has been named ' @entity9 ' after the head engineer aboard the @entity91 in classic sci - fi series @entity3			1
@entity9 operated the transporter , which ' beamed ' the crew onto planets the original object is scanned as @entity9 slices it apart , destroying it in the process			1
the digital blueprint is then sent to be printed in another location over an encrypted connection @entity3 - style ' beaming up ' through space could become a reality sometime in the far future			1
nothing in the laws of physics fundamentally forbids the teleportation of large objects , including humans , researchers claim			2
professor @entity111 , from @entity112 in the @entity113 , was able to transport an atom 9.8ft ( three metres ) with 100 per cent accuracy in may 2014			0
in professor @entity111 's experiment , three entangled particles - a nitrogen atom locked in a diamond crystal and two electrons - were used to transfer spin information			0
' what we are teleporting is the state of a particle , ' @entity111 said			0
' if you believe we are nothing more than a collection of atoms strung together in a particular way , then in principle it should be possible to teleport ourselves from one place to another			0
as 3d printing technology advances , leaked designs of a printable item could lead to physical objects being pirated and copied in much the same way as digital music			1
by destroying the original , the researchers hope to address this concern , potentially allowing trinkets bought on @entity144 to be sent instantaneously			0
' when the seller sends the object through @entity9 , the system guarantees that the seller ’s object ceases to exist the moment the buyer receives it , ' said the researchers			2
' @entity9 allows transferring objects quickly without infringing on designers ’ rights to be paid for their designs , ' they added			2
while @entity9 sounds impressive , there are limitations to the prototype teleporter			2
@entity9 can currently only print in plastic and in one colour , and objects must be painted black in order to maximise the contrast for the digital camera to ' scan ' it			1
but as 3d printing technology becomes more refined , the range and resolution of what ' teleporters ' like @entity9 can send and receive will only improve			1
@entity174 engineers created this helpful guide and cartoon to explain the complex system : how quantum teleportation works is complicated , but an analogy for the principle behind it may help : let 's say there are two people , @entity185 and @entity186			0
@entity185 wants @entity186 to have a photon that 's in the same ' state ' as her photon , which we 'll call photon @entity192 for the sake of this analogy , we 'll pretend that the ' state ' is a colour , and photon p is yellow			0
a third person named @entity200 sends out two entangled photons , photon a to @entity185 and photon b to @entity186 , which behave as if they are part of the same whole			0
both of these photons start out as blue			0
@entity185 's two photons , @entity209 , which is yellow , and @entity210 , which is blue , ' collide			0
' @entity185 measures the photons as they annihilate one another			0
although @entity209 are destroyed in the crash , @entity209 's yellow colour is preserved			0
because photon a and photon b are entangled , the yellow colour is ' teleported ' to @entity218 but in order to get photon b to become yellow , as photon @entity209 originally was , @entity185 needs to send @entity186 two bits of information to b the ' classical ' way - for example , by sending pulses of light over an optical fibre			0
' when @entity185 measures the state of her photon , @entity186 's photon changes state as well , as if flipping a switch , ' @entity229 said			0
' but @entity186 can not know how the switch flipped unless @entity185 sends him the bits of information classically			0
' @entity186 does not know that his photon has changed to yellow without that additional information .			0

device dubbed ' @entity9 ' scans objects to be ' teleported ' at click of a button
destroys original object as it digitises it , making sent copy unique
digital blueprint is then encrypted and sent to be rebuilt at new location
a 3d printer then reconstructs the object at the other end
@entity258 could help to solve *intellectual* property concerns resulting from the rise in 3d printing
