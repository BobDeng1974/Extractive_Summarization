by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:22 est , 18 february 2014 action : leading world press freedom organisations yesterday urged @entity5 to ' take immediate steps to safeguard press freedom in the @entity8 ' leading world press freedom organisations yesterday urged @entity5 to persuade @entity10 to repeal legislation underpinning the government ’s @entity12 on press regulation			1
in a letter to the prime minister , seven major international bodies described the @entity12 as ‘ incomprehensible arcana ’ and warned that ‘ autocratic ’ foreign leaders are already using it to justify repression			1
the bodies – including the @entity22 – urge mr @entity5 to ‘ take immediate steps to safeguard press freedom in the @entity8 and to ensure that the actions of your government are never used to justify media restrictions elsewhere in the world ’			1
they add : ‘ indeed , it should be a source of serious concern to your government that autocratic leaders seeking to limit media freedom now cite the @entity8 example			2
’ the @entity12 was drawn up by politicians and approved by the @entity38 in october in the wake of the @entity40 into alleged wrongdoing by journalists			1
it underpins with statute a new body to oversee the regulation of the press , with publications that refuse to comply facing ‘ exemplary ’ damages in libel cases			2
newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom			1
instead , the @entity46 is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities , known as the @entity58			0
it will be able to impose fines of up to £ 1million for serious and systematic wrongdoing			0
the press freedom organisations – who visited @entity8 last month – describe the charter as a ‘ medieval vestige ’ and ‘ a convoluted process virtually incomprehensible to anyone not versed in its arcana ’			1
warning : seven major international bodies described the government 's @entity12 as ' incomprehensible arcana ' and warned that ' autocratic ' foreign leaders are already using it to justify repression ( file picture ) their letter said : ‘ this @entity79 action , in our view , establishes statutory underpinning for media regulation			1
this means that the @entity84 has , in fact , been crossed			0
‘ it is our view that the @entity79 action that essentially compels participation in the regulatory mechanism belies claims that it will be “ voluntary ”			0
’ they told mr @entity5 he should urge @entity10 to repeal the statutes that underpin the @entity12			2
the press freedom groups told the prime minister how repressive regimes are already citing the @entity12 to justify gagging their own critics			1
request : the bodies also asked mr @entity5 to distance himself from the investigation into @entity98 over the leaks by @entity101 whistleblower @entity100 ( pictured ) they highlighted @entity104 ’s president @entity103 who ‘ has championed one of the most repressive media laws in all of @entity107 ’ and who has ‘ explicitly invoked the @entity8 example in defending his actions ’			2
the letter quotes a speech by @entity103 last year in which he denounced his critics and said : ‘ the @entity8 has created a communication law to regulate the excesses of a certain yellow press in that country			0
’ it also relates how the editor of a newspaper in @entity122 disclosed that officials ‘ now routinely cite actions of the @entity8 government in pressing the @entity122 media to “ self - regulate ” or face government action ’			0
the press freedom groups tell mr @entity5 : ‘ @entity8 ’s democracy , including its robust and diverse media , has been an inspiration to people around the world who struggle to be free , and is a source of @entity8 “ soft power ” and influence			1
’ referring to recent examples when mr @entity5 highlighted the dangers and difficulties of journalists working in @entity142 and @entity143 , they continue : ‘ your ability to exercise this kind of positive influence rests on the perception that the @entity8 media operates free of government interference			2
‘ any action that diminishes that perception not only emboldens autocratic leaders to take repressive action against the media but it erodes the ability of @entity8 to exercise moral suasion			0
’ the letter also asks mr @entity5 to distance himself from the investigation into @entity98 over the leaks by @entity101 whistleblower @entity100			0
it says the prime minister should ‘ refrain from any public comments to avoid the perception of political pressure ’			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
