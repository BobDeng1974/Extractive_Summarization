by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 produced an immaculate performance to win @entity4 gold and then declared he was in hot pursuit of the man considered by many to be the greatest gymnast of all time			1
the high bar creaked as @entity1 flew round it like a rotator blade , before sticking his landing without so much as a stray toenail			1
it was the final faultless act in an almost perfect round of competition which saw him run away with the all - around title , beating his @entity22 team - mates @entity20 and @entity23 into silver and bronze medal positions , respectively			1
@entity1 , who won the team title on tuesday , could conceivably take seven medals home from @entity28 , with five individual finals to come over the next two days , and he is a genuine gold - medal prospect in three of them			1
but @entity1 will not rest on his laurels and said he had set his sights on challenging @entity55 ’s reigning @entity54 and six - time world champion , @entity56			1
‘ i have been trying to push towards him , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ it ’s an honour to be in the same sentence as that guy			0
he ’s been my absolute idol my whole gymnastics career			0
’ for many years , gymnastics has been transmitted to the wider @entity22 public by @entity50 and @entity65 , both of whom were at @entity28 ’s @entity68 to cheer on @entity1			2
but @entity50 claimed @entity1 has replaced the pair as the new face of gymnastics in @entity22			1
‘ i think he already has ( taken over the mantle ) , ’ she said			0
‘ after @entity74 he was a double bronze medallist and i do n’t think he truly realised what he had achieved			1
since then he has been building on that success and he is definitely a star			0
‘ he was totally world class today , ’ added @entity50			2
‘ he had all the pressure on him leading into these championships			0
it was his to lose , there is no doubt about that			0
it was always going to be who would come second and third , as long as @entity1 had a nice day in the gym			2
’ @entity87 dreams : @entity1 strains his muscles to make the leap between hoops during his gold - winning display steady : the @entity94 gymnast scored an impressive 90.631 across the six apparatus to win gold unlikely hero : @entity97 paid the price for a tricky routine in the men 's 1m springboard diving with a drawstring plastic bag containing his chalk slung over his shoulder , @entity1 walked between apparatus with all the nonchalance of a schoolchild heading to @entity109 class			1
on the vault , where he was trying out a more testing routine , he took a half stumble on landing , a minor blemish on an otherwise sublime day			0
but the gold medal was effectively sealed with @entity1 two points clear before he had even moved on to the high bar , the final test of power , poise and nerve			1
by the time his games finishes on friday , @entity1 will have endured five straight days of intense competition			2
‘ i ’m really tired , ’ he admitted			0
‘ it ’s really hard actually but you know , you need to make sure you get the right food , the right rest and keep that adrenaline going			0
and wait until the end to celebrate			0
’ they call it the @entity134 and the camaraderie between the home nation gymnasts was clear			0
@entity1 was embraced by a beaming @entity20 when his winning score flashed on to the big screen			2
his @entity139 team - mate @entity23 , 18 , who took bronze with a score of 87.965 , was also on hand to offer his congratulations			1
@entity23 , in his first senior competition , nailed the parallel bars and looks likely to follow @entity1 as a star of the all - around in the future			1
‘ he is unbelievable , ’ said @entity50			0
‘ in may he picked up five gold medals in the junior ranks and it is a big step to go to seniors but he has taken it in his stride			2
to have three from the home nations on the podium truly puts @entity22 gymnastics on the world stage			0
’ @entity158 : day 7 review balancing act : the 21 - year - old produced a huge score of 15.866 on the pommel horse delighted : @entity1 punches the air after winning his first individual @entity4 title			1

double @entity54 bronze medallist added to the team gold won on tuesday
the 21 - year - old scored a total of 90.631 across all six pieces of apparatus to win his first individual @entity4 title
@entity39 's @entity38 claimed silver while @entity139 team - mate @entity23 won bronze
@entity1 says he is pushing himself towards @entity54 champion @entity56
