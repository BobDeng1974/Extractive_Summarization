@entity38 of @entity39 said : ‘ we can only hope that prince @entity0 , who no longer has an official role in promoting trade , is instead using these “ private ” talks at @entity16 to persuade the ambassador to raise serious concerns about the numerous human rights abuses in @entity8			1

during one stay he was reported to have visited a luxury spa owned by mr @entity7 , which employs a blind @entity81 masseur described as having ‘ the best hands in the world ’			2
the regularity of @entity0 ’s visits to @entity8 – where he is referred to as ‘ the dear guest ’ – has led to speculation in the country ’s media that he may have business links to the state , including a golf resort on the @entity93			1
