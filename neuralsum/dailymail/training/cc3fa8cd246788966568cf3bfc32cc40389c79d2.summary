by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 31 may 2013 it is no secret that rabbits like to hop			2
but these specially trained ' show - jumping ' bunnies are leaping to a whole new level by vaulting hurdles and fences like horses			1
the hobby has taken a leap in popularity in @entity12 and competitions are regularly being held across the country			2
@entity15 , 26 , has been training her rabbits , @entity17 and honey , for two years			0
it 's so cute to watch and they can be pretty entertaining			0
' we originally got into it for exercise reasons , i wanted them to be healthy so set up jumps around my garden			0
now they just run as fast as they can back and forth over the jumps			0
' i first got rabbits about four years ago , but it was only when i went to a show that i discovered rabbit jumping and thought " why not give it a go ? " one giant leap : the mats have to be made out of rubber because if the course was made of grass the rabbits would be more interested in eating it than jumping jumping bunny : another rabbit goes for a much smaller leap during the training session great jump : these specially trained show - jumping bunnies are leaping to a whole new level - vaulting hurdles and fences like horse the rabbits are marked for the speed and height at which they jump the course ' when it comes to competitions i want them to enjoy themselves			1
i do n't push them into training , they choose to do it , it 's not about winning for me as long as they 're happy			0
' @entity17 's a bit more enthusiastic than @entity86 though , she prefers to do the limbo			0
she would rather go underneath the jumps than over them , but that 's just as fun			0
' the sport was invented in @entity28 in the 1980s but has steadily grown in popularity across the globe			1
the rabbits are marked for the speed and height at which they jump the course			0
they compete along a rubber mat but not grass - because ' they are more interested in eating it ' than jumping			1
costly : rabbits can cost up to £ 1,000 a year to ' maintain ' jump : a rabbit jumps the course at a practice session held at @entity24 in @entity25 the sport is taken as a bit of fun - but rabbit lover @entity110 , 17 , who has been training her bunnies for several years , urged the public not to buy the animals specifically for jumping			1
she said : ' it takes time , patience and an energetic , eager rabbit to take part in rabbit jumping			1
' rabbits are a massive responsibility and can cost up to £ 1,000 a year each - even without including their accommodation costs - and rabbits should have company so the cost is even more ; they are not creatures that should be bought on a whim			2
competitors : a group of children with their rabbits at the centre in @entity25 , @entity26 jumping rabbit : @entity133 holds her pet during the training session for show - jumping bunnies ' if anyone is serious about getting a pair of rabbits then rabbit rescues are the best place to go with thousands , young and old , looking for new homes			1
' the a-level student of @entity144 , @entity26 , who has rabbits @entity146 and @entity147 , added : ' you do not need proper hurdles to get started			0
plant pots and garden canes work well - but whatever is used , the bars must fall from both sides when touched to prevent the rabbit from hurting itself			1
' rabbit jumping is about your rabbits getting exercise and enjoying themselves so always make it a positive experience for them			2
when they do n't want to jump anymore , do n't force them			0
