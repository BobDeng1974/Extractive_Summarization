by @entity0 for the @entity1 lawyers last night joined calls for the taxman not to be allowed to seize money directly from bank accounts			1
building societies , accountants and small firms have already questioned whether @entity10 can be trusted with the powers when it has a record of making mistakes			1
@entity15 went further by branding the debt recovery proposals as ‘ draconian and regressive ’			1
he added : ‘ we agree that tax that is due must be paid , but @entity10 ’s existing powers – if properly used – are sufficient			1
there are already streamlined procedures for recovery of tax due in @entity40 courts			1
‘ we are concerned that the direct recovery of debt from bank accounts without judicial supervision may not comply with data protection or human rights legislation			0
’ outlined in @entity48 , the plans would allow the taxman to take cash directly from a current account , joint account or @entity53 , without going through the courts			1
around 17,000 people a year could have money seized			0
@entity26 from @entity15 says lawyers feared @entity10 ( whose headquarters in @entity58 are pictured above ) ‘ has a tendency to press on even when it has not demonstrated any need for additional powers ’ plans outlined in @entity64 's budget would allow taxman to take cash and not go through courts the scheme has been subject to a consultation that opponents said appeared to have been little more than a formality			1
@entity72 , of the @entity73 , said the number of groups that had expressed concern should be a wake - up call for the @entity78			0
he added : ‘ the government must take all the objections on board rather than pushing forward with this and acting like a bull in a china shop			0
‘ they need to rethink the whole proposal , which we think is defective			0
the impression we are getting is that they will go ahead with this whatever people say , and probably before the next election			0
’ the @entity93 issued a stark warning about the proposals on monday , saying savers might go back to storing cash under the mattress if they fear their money is not safe in the bank			2
it said @entity10 ’s record of blunders meant it could not be trusted to be ‘ judge , jury and executioner ’			1
a wide range of organisations have questioned the plans , including the @entity110 , civil liberties charity @entity112 , the @entity113 and the @entity114			2
@entity10 will target only those who owe at least £ 1,000 and who would have at least £ 5,000 left in their bank account after the debt is taken			2
tax officials should also have contacted them at least four times			0
the @entity123 , a debt charity , claimed the safeguards were insufficient			0
but an @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ @entity128 proposals contain numerous safeguards ’ , and ‘ will level the playing field firmly but fairly ’ .			2
