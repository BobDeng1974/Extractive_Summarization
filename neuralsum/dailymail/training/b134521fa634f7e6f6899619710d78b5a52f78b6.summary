@entity4 , whose character was famed for his shabbiness and lack of hygiene , admitted he was ‘ a little gob - smacked ’ at being honoured and joked that he would now be rescuing damsels in distress and slaughtering dragons if the need arose			2
more seriously , he added : ‘ i ’ll use my new title to highlight the causes i believe in , particularly the importance of culture , the arts and heritage in our society , and the plight of the infirm elderly and their carers			2
’ with his catchphrase ‘ i have a cunning plan ’ , @entity4 became @entity35 ’s favourite dogsbody as the long - suffering @entity8			2
and as a history - mad presenter on @entity39 , he has dug up some of the country ’s most prestigious archaeological sites			1
but his knighthood reflects neither his popularity as a sitcom star nor as a history buff			1
instead , the 66 - year - old actor was recommended for his ‘ public and political service ’ as a @entity50 activist			2
his name was put forward by the @entity52 , set up last year by @entity53 to reward party workers			2
@entity4 was a member of @entity50 ’s @entity55 for four years during the @entity57 era , and spent four years as vice-president of the left - wing actors ’ union equity			2
his activism has never been low - key – wherever there ’s a high - profile @entity64 cause , he can often be found waving his red flag			0
when @entity67 and @entity68 were handing out @entity70 wristbands in the run - up to the @entity72 in 2005 , @entity4 was one of the most vociferous showbusiness supporters			0
his involvement with @entity75 has seen him make several documentaries in @entity77			0
recognition : the @entity10 star , left , was nominated for his ' public and political services ' in @entity35 , he rarely seems to miss a demo			1
at the @entity82 rally against the @entity84 ’s spending cuts in march 2011 he was a keynote speaker , and alongside hard - left labour mp @entity85 he campaigns on issues such as housing and welfare benefits in @entity89 , the @entity90 borough where he grew up			0
success : @entity4 was a little - known actor before @entity10 @entity4 was a little - known actor before @entity10			1
but his career had begun with a @entity94 success – he was spotted in an amateur show and offered a part as one of @entity99 ’s boys in the original 1960 production of @entity102 ’s musical , @entity103 ! one night , as understudy , he stood in at short notice for the @entity106			0
the experience left him with a love of comedy acting			0
he spent years in repertory , then set up a community theatre group			0
by the time he was cast as @entity8 in 1983 , he was in his late 30s with two children			0
he felt distanced from the rest of the cast : @entity13 , @entity115 and @entity116 , and writers @entity117 and @entity119 , were all young graduates			1
the son of a council worker , @entity4 had left school after gaining four o - levels			0
‘ the impression you got was that they slid off the silver spoon straight into the rehearsal room at @entity130 , ’ he said			0
four series of @entity10 made him a household name , but it was a chance encounter with archaeology professor @entity133 during a holiday in the @entity136 islands that led to @entity4 ’s most long - lived tv role – as the eager amateur on @entity39 , leaping into @entity140 excavations or medieval ruins to uncover fragments of history			1
his enthusiasm was contagious , and the country fell in love with archaeology			0
even the @entity148 were swept along			0
when @entity4 was invited to a garden party at @entity150 , the @entity151 , the @entity152 and prince @entity153 became engrossed in conversation about what a @entity39 dig could discover at the royal sites			1
new career : mr @entity4 forged a second life as the presenter of @entity39 on @entity161 @entity4 ’s private life has been colourful			1
he had a short - lived first marriage , when he was 21 , and since @entity39 launched in 1994 , he has had long - term relationships with his admin assistant @entity165 , and with singer - songwriter @entity166			1
two years ago , he married his statuesque partner @entity167 , who is 34 years his junior and , at 5ft 9in , five inches taller than him			0
she is also younger than both his children from his 20 - year relationship with @entity172 solicitor @entity171			0
the knighthood will further increase his profile			1
he once said : ‘ @entity10 fans call out , “ i have a cunning plan ”			1
@entity39 lovers want me to dig up their garden … while the @entity178 shout : “ you labour idiot ! ” ’ from now on , perhaps that should be ‘ sir @entity50 idiot ’ .			1
