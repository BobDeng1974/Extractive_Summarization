it was the place to be seen in @entity1 when @entity2 played to packed houses , but the @entity4 since fell into disrepair - now campaigners are hoping to raise enough cash to refurbish the @entity9 - listed building			1
local youth campaigners want to see the building , which featured an ornate three - tier theatre , a ballroom and a restaurant , turned into an arts centre and hub for groups in the @entity1 area			1
plans to restore the building , including the roof , could cost more than £ 20 million			1
locals call it a ' monument to the area 's past ' and a hidden gem , which , when restored will once again become the place to go			0
it featured stunning gilded decorations , red velvet seats and a huge auditorium			0
stars , who also included @entity51 and @entity52 performing at the 3,000 - seater theatre , were said to arrive there through tunnels leading into the city centre to avoid the public			2
among those helping to raise awareness and funds to have the building restored is the @entity62 , a not - for - profit enterprise			2
@entity64 , of @entity62 , says : ' the building needs to be saved			0
it is a beautiful piece of architecture in the @entity68 and we are talking to @entity70 to have it upgraded from a @entity72 with a star which would give it more credence			0
stunning colours : reds , purple , organe , green , turqoise - the 1901 building is a treasure in the north west of @entity83 , according to locals well worn : ripped walls and and bird droppings visible all over , but the ornate railings and staircase still stand out dirty floors and dust - but the detailing of the @entity4 in @entity1 , like on this railing , is extraordinary nothing was left to detail when architects designed the @entity4 - every piece of interior is carved and crafted an empty bottle sitting on the bar , which was once buzzing with concert and theatre goers in @entity1 youth volunteers help restore the building as much as they can , but , says @entity64 of @entity62 : ' we would like to raise money and get it fully restored ' ' the building has withstood two world wars and do n't forget it 's over a 100 years old - no wonder it looks a bit dusty			1
' we have between 20 - 100 volunteers who have been working on cleaning it up and making small repairs for a couple of years			0
but we 'd like a lot of interest so we can get it properly repaired			0
' today church group @entity116 have held services in the foyer area since buying the building in 1999			2
they have leased the building , which is on the at risk register by @entity122 , to @entity62 and will continue to use it while work goes on in the rest of the building			0
the @entity2 , from left to right : @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 - performed at the @entity4 in @entity1 jazz and @entity132 singer @entity52 was another star attraction at the @entity4 as were @entity51 a hidden gem : @entity1 youth campaigners want to see it turned into a arts centre and a hub for the local community ' the building has withstood two world wars , ' says @entity64 of @entity62			1
' no wonder it looks a bit dusty ' legroom : red velvet fabric covered the seats and and there were beautiful , dark and shiny tiles on the pilars from here the audience could watch and listen to performers such as @entity2 , @entity52 and @entity51 when audiences dwindled the @entity4 was turned into a bingo hall before closing in the 1980 - today community workers hope to raise at least £ 20 million to restore the building			1

plans to restore the building , where both @entity2 and @entity51 performed to packed houses , are likely to cost at least £ 20 million
