scientists have discovered a new species of fish in waters more than six miles deep			1
the researchers discovered the new breed of eelpout fish while combing some of the deepest waters in the world near the @entity9 , north of @entity10			1
they also set new depth records for rattail fish and large deep sea cusk eels , some of the most abundant of the deep - sea species			1
scientists are thrilled at the discovery of the eelpout , a species not known to science before the waters in which the team from the @entity23 's @entity22 are so deep that they exceed the height of @entity27			1
the scientists launched more than 50 fishing nets over the last 14 months to a depth 9,900 metres - 1,052 metres deeper than the height of @entity27 , which is 8,848 metres			0
dr @entity31 , the voyage leader , said : ' it 's always fantastic to discover new species of fish and to find a new type of eelpout is a massive success			1
' ' it 's even better for us because we spent most of the summer building the equipment that was used to find these fish and so it 's even more gratifying to have success			1
it was this big ! the scientists pose with some of the rare species of fish they found in deep waters off the coast of @entity10 ' and now , between this and the previous two expeditions over the last 14 months , we have sampled from a depth range greater than @entity27 is high			1
' we are never quite sure what we will find on these expeditions to unchartered territories			0
' we had set out to find out more about the deep sea fish communities and we were delighted to find both new species and new depth records for fish			1
' but what we found was better than we expected and we ca n't wait to get back out there in october for another expedition			0
' the new species of deep - sea cusk eel was found by scientists off @entity10 who set new records for the depth at which they were found because the waters the fish were found in are so deep , the fish are unable to see			1
dr @entity31 said : ' while the eelpouts , rattails and large deep sea cusk eels do have optical nerves , they are practically blind			1
' they would n't be able to see a thing if they were at a higher depth as white light from the sun is too bright			0
' they 're surrounded by pure darkness at depths of the sea they live in , but jellyfish and shrimps give off a very , very dim blue light which eelpouts and the like can actually see			0
' dr @entity31 and colleagues from @entity92 and @entity93 @entity93 conducted dozens of ocean samples in seven days of sampling			1
they took more than 6,500 photographs of deep sea fish and caught about 100 in total			2
a new fish found in the rivers and creeks in the @entity104 deep south has been named after president @entity105			2
two scientists from @entity107 and @entity108 decided to name the five new species of darter they had found after @entity104 presidents			2
the freshwater darter was thus dubbed the @entity113			0
ecologist @entity114 told @entity115 : ' we chose president @entity105 for his environmental leadership , particularly in the areas of clean energy and environmental protection , and because he is one of our first leaders to approach conservation and environmental protection from a more global vision			0
' the other species of darter that mr @entity114 and his colleague @entity128 discovered were dubbed @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity133 gore			2
the biggest scoop was finding a new species of eelpout at depths of 4,250 metres			2
a new depth record of 5,500m was also set for a rattail fish - a breed which have never been caught in the southwest @entity141 before			2
another rattail fish - in depths of between 2,000 metres and 4,500 metres - which has not been caught in @entity10 waters for more than 100 years was also discovered			2
and finally , large deep sea cusk eels were found at another record depth of 3500m			0
the scientists onboard the research vessel @entity151 used landers with cameras attached that free - fall to the seafloor , as well as baited fish traps to attract the animals			0
@entity92 principal scientist dr @entity158 said : ' the international collaboration enables @entity10 researchers to use scientific equipment we do n't have , and to sample places that would otherwise be inaccessible , and hence unknown			0
' the results from this deep exploration are giving us a much better understanding of biodiversity in the deep sea around @entity10 , and enable us to better assess potential risks to the ecosystem from future climate change and even human activities which may include seabed mining			0
' dr @entity31 added : ' a voyage such as this is testament to how feasible scientific research in the deep sea has become			0
' it is no longer the inaccessible , out of reach , part of the world it once was			0
' the technological challenges of the past are being overcome , and should n't limit our responsibility to learn about and understand the deep sea to help ensure the long term health of the deep oceans - one of the largest environments on @entity191			0
' the new specimens are being held at the @entity193 at the @entity93			1
the scientists also found a rare species of rattail fish , the first time it had been found in the @entity141 the cosmpolitan rattail was first caught off @entity10 by the @entity199 in a global scientific expedition in the 1870s			1

new species of fish are blind
the fish are being held at the @entity93
