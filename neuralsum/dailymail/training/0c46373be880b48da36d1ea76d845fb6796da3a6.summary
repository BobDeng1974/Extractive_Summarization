by @entity0 it seems that men and women ca n't agree – even when asleep			1
a study of dreams found that even in the dead of night , the sexes are thinking about different things			2
while men have nightmares about fires , floods , wars and other disasters , women are jolted awake by thoughts about rows , lies and infidelity			1
@entity20 researchers asked more than 300 men and women to write down the content of their dreams on waking each morning for up to five weeks			1
researchers found men dream of fires , wars and disasters while women think about lies , rows and infidelity they then zeroed in on nightmares – in which the person woke up mid-dream – and bad dreams , which while still disturbing were less intense			1
diary entries on nightmares were longer than those for bad dreams and women wrote longer descriptions of their bad dreams than men			1
nightmares were dominated with scenes of physical aggression , including kidnappings and murders			2
rows and fights , humiliation , infidelity and other forms of ' interpersonal conflict ' formed the second most common theme			0
feelings of failure and helplessness , including being late or lost , were also common , as were nightmares in which the dreamer became ill or died			0
many also jolted awake after believing they could see or feel the presence of an evil force such as a monster , alien , vampire or ghost			0
the men studied were twice as likely to have nightmares or bad dreams about disasters			1
they were also plagued by images of infestations of insects			0
diary entries on nightmares were longer than those for bad dreams and women wrote longer descriptions of their bad dreams than men the women , in contrast , were more likely to have nightmares about rows , broken friendships and relationship fears , including infidelity			1
the study 's authors , from the @entity88 , said : ' dreams of interpersonal conflicts may elicit a more intense emotional response thin women , leading to a greater proportion of such dreams ending in a nightmare awakening			1
' writing in the journal @entity98 , they added that their research is especially informative , as it used diary entries rather than tick list - type questionnaires to log the content of people 's dreams			2
it is thought that everyone dreams			2
most people forget them straight away but heavy sleepers have better recall			0
researcher @entity112 said that nightmares can have serious consequences for health			0
he said : ' nightmares are not a disease in themselves but can be a problem for the individual who anticipates them or who is greatly distressed by their nightmares			0
' people who have frequent nightmares may fear falling asleep – and being plunged into their worst dreams			2
' some nightmares occur every night			0
' people who are awakened by their nightmares can not get back to sleep , which creates artificial insomnia			0
