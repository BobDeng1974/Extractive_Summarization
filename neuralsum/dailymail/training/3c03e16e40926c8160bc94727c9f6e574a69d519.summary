head of @entity1 , sir @entity2 , will warn too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational ‘ basics ’ the number of children being taught in failing secondary schools has risen to 170,000 – despite a drive to boost standards , the head of @entity1 will reveal today			1
some 147 schools are now in special measures , a rise of 62 per cent , while those given top ratings remains the same			0
sir @entity2 will cite the data as evidence that standards have stagnated – and progress could even go into reverse			1
despite giving heads more freedom to run their own affairs , he will warn that too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational ' basics ' – with ' indifferent ' teaching and poor discipline			1
launching his annual report , sir @entity2 will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated ' inadequate ' by @entity1 has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000			1
at the same time , the proportion of schools given @entity1 's top ratings – good and outstanding – remains unchanged on last year at about 70 per cent			2
while primary schools are continuing to ' forge ahead ' , improvements at secondary level have ' plateaued ' , he will say			0
in too many cases , secondaries are allowing bad behaviour to go unchallenged and are led by ' weak ' head teachers and governors who lack oversight of standards			2
sir @entity2 – the chief inspector of schools – will add that many secondaries ' lack meaningful support ' despite the government 's academies programme which has seen hundreds of schools govern themselves or hand over management to sponsors			1
in a speech to launch his third annual report , he will call for an end to ' sterile ' debates about how schooling should be structured			0
' where schools are failing , it is not because they are local authority schools or academies , or because they are part of a multi-academy trust or because they stand alone , ' he will tell an audience			0
' they are failing because they have n't got the essentials right : governance and oversight is weak , leadership is poor , misbehaviour goes unchallenged and teaching is indifferent			2
launching his annual report , sir @entity2 will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated ' inadequate ' by @entity1 has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000 ' if our education system is to continue to progress we need to concentrate on the basics of why schools and colleges fail and why they succeed			1
' he will also call for stronger monitoring of struggling schools which had become ' isolated ' and lacked support from local authorities or sponsors			1
' these schools are deprived of effective support when times are bad , ' he will say			0
' they are left unchallenged when they flirt with complacency			0
in many cases they are totally insulated from effective governance			0
they are bereft of good leadership and teaching practice			0
they remain apart from schools that could partner them			0
' in contrast , sir @entity2 will highlight the performance of schools rated ' outstanding ' which he says are doing a ' superb job ' and creating a ' strong learning ethos '			1
and he will argue that primaries have continued to improve , largely because heads and governors are ' getting the basics right ' – such as the effective teaching of the ' phonics ' reading method			0
alongside a national report , sir @entity2 will also publish eight regional reports			1
it will show that in 13 local authority areas , fewer than half of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding by @entity1 .			2

head of @entity1 will say the data proves school standards have stagnated
sir @entity2 will warn many secondaries struggle to provide basics
he added those schools also had ' indifferent ' teaching and poor discipline
report will call for support for struggling schools which become ' isolated '
