they have been turning up in significant numbers every few years some parts of the country will struggle to get above freezing on wednesday and thursday , with snow and freezing rain possible on high ground , according to @entity168 , the weather division of the @entity170			1
but the cold weather is likely to break on friday , leading to a warmer but wetter weekend			1
@entity172 , a forecaster at @entity168 , said today and tomorrow will be mainly clear and dry , with some showers on the @entity175 coast			1
pretty as a picture : @entity177 covered rooftops in @entity179 , @entity180 where early this morning snow showers gave a wintry blanket across part of @entity180 paw prints are left in fresh snow in a snow covered street in @entity179 , @entity180 as snow covers a field but wednesday will bring more cloud in southern @entity191 and @entity192 and the chance of wintry showers over high ground in @entity196 and northern @entity191 in the afternoon after a clear start			1
' things start to change on thursday , the cloud will thicken up before moving south and there are some light showers moving on ahead of a band of rain , ' she said			1
' some of those could be wintry or freezing rain			0
' spectacular : the sun sets over the castle at @entity210 on the upper reaches of @entity212 stunning sight : an unusual cloud over the north east of @entity196 last night - described by weather experts as a nacreous cloud formation due to a chemical reaction 50 miles above the earth 's surface rare : nacreous clouds form in the stratosphere between 10 and 30 miles up and are made up of miniscule ice crystals forming at minus 85 degrees @entity225 daytime temperatures in northern @entity191 and @entity196 could struggle to top @entity227 ( @entity228 ) on wednesday and thursday , she added , with some isolated spots failing to get above @entity231 ( @entity232 )			2
but by friday temperatures will have risen , with averages of @entity235 ( @entity236 ) in the south and @entity238 ( @entity239 ) in the north			2

three day forecast : wintry showers could return to the @entity123 later this week , forecasters say @entity259 , 49 , was stunned when he saw the pearlescent clouds in @entity261 , near @entity262 in @entity196 yesterday evening			2
' i have observed hundreds of aurora above @entity196 , but this is the first time in 25 years i ’ve seen these beautiful pearlescent clouds , ' said @entity259 , who works as a meteorologist			0
nacreous clouds form in the stratosphere between 10 and 30 miles up and are made up of miniscule ice crystals forming at minus 85 degrees @entity225			0
they are typically seen in the winter months as the sun sets or rises and are illuminated by the sun ’s rays from below the horizon			0
@entity277 stuck : a cow fell into this iced - over swimming pool in @entity280 , @entity281 , and could n't get out			0
' we drained the pool and managed to haul her out using a tractor , ' said a fire brigade spokesman the iridescent colours are due to the ice crystals being of a uniform shape and size and the cloud covering being thin			0
the sun has to be at just the right angle below the horizon to cause diffraction and interference with the crystals to produce the beautiful colours			0
scientists believe the clouds also help accelerate the process of the depletion of the ozone layer			0
the clouds provide a surface for the chlorine and bromine in @entity309 ’s to react into an active form , which makes the chlorine more destructive to the ozone layer .			0

the two silver cars are now floating in the @entity51 in @entity7 , @entity8 , after two separate incidents at the flooded ford
today and tomorrow will be mainly clear and dry , with some showers on the @entity175 coast
