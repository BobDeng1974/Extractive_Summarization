the only certainty , at least so far as 10 minutes ago , is that if @entity1 fights @entity2 this summer it will not take place at @entity4			1
the @entity6 pay - tv network in @entity7 has determined may 30 as the putative date for that potential blockbuster and the new @entity4 is already booked that saturday for one of the oldest fixtures in our sporting calendar : a little local matter called the @entity15			1
@entity16 and the @entity2 actually box each other that day , somewhere , depends on whether the @entity18 chooses to fight either or neither of them in @entity21 four weeks earlier			2
@entity1 and @entity2 met at a south @entity23 boxing club last week to discuss a possible fight @entity2 visited @entity23 but if he does fight @entity1 , the fight will not be held at @entity4 if @entity27 picks one , the other will be left to fight that hardy old regular around the rings , @entity28			1
if he opts for @entity30 , then @entity2 and @entity1 will be looking for a place to conduct their violent but lucrative business			1
@entity35 ’s @entity34 is a possibility but @entity21 or @entity37 is more likely , or even @entity38 where extra bucket loads of cash in the form of a massive site fee beckons @entity1 , the hero of moderate @entity43			2
meanwhile , the wait goes on and the speculation becomes ever more feverish			0
cup a hand to one ear and you hear a respected insider , @entity7 tv commentator @entity49 , pronouncing definitively : ‘ @entity27 is fighting @entity30 in @entity21 on may 2			1
’ strain the other ear and you can discern @entity2 saying : ‘ i now expect to be fighting @entity27 next			1
’ cock both ears to the fans surrounding @entity27 at a basketball game the other night and you are deafened by chants like these : ‘ fight @entity2 … we want @entity2			1
’ @entity27 is yet to decide who he will fight when he returns to the ring in @entity21 on may 2 @entity27 could opt to have a rematch with @entity30 , whom he beat three years ago is he listening ? only if this is a shot the pound - for - pound king really wants to call			1
does he care ? perhaps only if his paymasters at the @entity65 tv network tell him that these vocal expressions of public opinion indicate the risk of a fall in his pay - per - view ratings if he recycles @entity30 , who he outpointed by a desert mile a couple of years ago			0
when @entity2 made his most confident forecast yet that @entity27 would finally agree to the richest fight in boxing history , he did so when within ear - shot of @entity1			1
that was during their visit to the historic @entity79 in south east @entity23 , a grass - roots engagement which @entity2 fitted in between dinner with prince @entity82 at @entity83 and judging the @entity85 contest in @entity86			2
later , for a @entity88 filming of his visit to @entity23 to be screened at 10.15 pm this wednesday , @entity2 said : ‘ @entity27 claims he ’s the no 1 pound for pound , so i want to feel the punches of the no 1 pound for pound , ’ with regard to @entity27 ’s demands for @entity96 standard blood testing , @entity2 added : ‘ he knows blood testing is no the issue			1
he ’s just making up alibis to avoid the fight			0
’ @entity2 met prince @entity82 on his trip to @entity23 , pictured on the right with wife @entity104 @entity2 waves from the stage during the @entity108 pageant on sunday night neither that narrative nor @entity30 ’s possibly tell - tale withdrawal from a bout with @entity112 were music to @entity1 ’s ears , since he harbours his own ambition of boxing @entity27			1
but at least he and his old sparing mate @entity2 have their @entity117 pretty much in place			2
@entity2 ’s promoter @entity120 – who has to keep rebutting claims from @entity27 ’s @entity122 that it is he not @entity27 who is blocking the biggest one of all – has sounded out the @entity126 in @entity21 and @entity37 ’s @entity127 as the alternatives to @entity1 ’s apparently unworkable @entity4 proposition			1
it is unlikely that any other venue in @entity132 could overcome @entity6 ’s reluctance to compromise their optimum saturday fight - night broadcast schedule , given the trans - @entity136 time difference			2
there has been talk of @entity38 bank - rolling a @entity27 - @entity2 fight to the tune of $ 300 million but , in the absence of an enthusiastic response , that offer was withdrawn			1
@entity120 is among those who would take much convincing of the feasibility of such a project , not least since he is committed to opening up the vast @entity151 boxing market through promotions in @entity153 like the one in which @entity2 recently thrashed @entity155			2
@entity156 ( right ) is desperate to face @entity1 after winning the @entity158 welterweight title against @entity159 @entity156 makes the first defence of his title against mandatory challenger @entity162 on march 28 and whither @entity1 if @entity27 and @entity2 are occupied with each othe in the @entity164 rather than @entity166 desert this may ? @entity4 would be back in the picture for a proposed @entity168 in june if @entity156 ’s promoter @entity169 could tempt @entity1 to challenge for @entity171 ’s recently won world welterweight belt			1
@entity156 returns from the horrific stab wound suffered in a holiday incident for a routine voluntary defence in @entity175 on march 28 but @entity1 is already working on his @entity176 with @entity177 and two men against whom he suffered defeats , @entity180 and @entity181 , among possible opponents			2
but all depends on whom @entity27 invites to his may ball			0
the word is that he will name the anointed one by the start of next week , but like so much else in this soap opera that is pure speculation			0
we will keep our ear to the ground			0
@entity156 ’s options for a big fight of his own are widening with the arrival in @entity23 of @entity197			1
the @entity199 legend , who confirmed his @entity201 candidacy with that brutal knock - out of @entity2 , is expected to have mano - a - mano talks with @entity156 about a summer showdown in @entity205			1
@entity197 is in town as assistant trainer and star supporter of @entity209 , his countryman who meets @entity210 in a world lightweight title final eliminator at @entity23 ’s @entity212 on saturday night			0
@entity197 's ( right ) last fight was a unanimous points win over @entity215 last year @entity197 knocked @entity2 out cold when they met for a third time in @entity21 in december 2012 however , @entity197 is said to be contemplating a challenge to brook for his world welterweight title if @entity175 ’s @entity171 successfully defends that @entity158 belt against @entity162 on his march 28 home - town comeback from stab wounds			2
@entity223 , renowned lead trainer of @entity197 and @entity209 , told @entity224 : ‘ there is a meeting			0
@entity197 is coming to the end of a fine career but still cherishes the ambition of becoming @entity199 ’s first five - weight world champion			0
’ @entity223 says : if @entity197 can do that it would be fantastic , an ideal way for him to retire			0
and we ’d like a fight with @entity156			2
’ first , @entity197 will be firmly in @entity209 ’s corner for a fight which will also decide which is the strongest power behind a prize - fighter – iconic professional backing or a good woman			0
@entity210 ( right ) fights for the first time since may when he faces @entity209 at the @entity212 on saturday @entity209 unsuccessfully challenged for the @entity242 lightweight world title against @entity243 last year @entity209 says : ‘ @entity210 is a good fighter but i will be all the stronger for having @entity197 behind me , helping me , inspiring me			0
’ @entity244 ’s @entity210 admits that boozy nights undermined his two world title challenges thus far – against @entity247 and @entity248 – but now says : ‘ my new girlfriend @entity249 has helped me turn away from the drink , improve my diet and focus on my training			0
i ’m all about the boxing now			0
’ the winner of this one becomes the mandatory challenger to @entity242 world champion @entity243			0
@entity210 vs @entity209 will be televised live on @entity88 1 from 8pm on saturday night			0
@entity257 , @entity132 ’s super-heavyweight gold medallist at the @entity258 , had his meteoric rise through the professional ranks interrupted by withdrawal with injury from a co-bill - topping fight at this saturday ’s @entity212 against solid @entity7 @entity265			1
that fight is being rescheduled as one of two appearances planned for @entity257 by promoter @entity169 in the month of april			0
@entity257 , who was among the throng of aspiring younger boxers who welcomed @entity2 and @entity1 to the century old @entity79 club on friday , told me there : ‘ it was a stress fracture of the back but it ’s getting better			1
at this stage of my career i want to fight often , like boxers in the old days			0

@entity1 and @entity2 met at a @entity23 boxing club last week
but if they do fight , it will not be at @entity4 and probably in @entity7
both are waiting to find out if they will face @entity27 on may 2
@entity156 also hopes to fight @entity1 this summer in a @entity132 blockbuster
