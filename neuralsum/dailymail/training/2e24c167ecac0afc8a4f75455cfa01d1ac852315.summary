by @entity0 , @entity1 editor more than one million @entity2 suffer food poisoning every year , with supermarket chicken named as the biggest offender more than one million @entity2 suffer food poisoning every year , with supermarket chicken named as the biggest offender			1
a huge problem of sickness , diarrhoea and vomiting linked to dirty food and poor hygiene in the home and restaurants is revealed in new figures from the @entity16			1
apart from the personal misery , the cost of treating the victims of this epidemic in terms of the @entity22 and time off work is put at more than £ 1.8billion a year			1
the watchdog names campylobacter , which is most often found on raw chicken , as the biggest cause of food poisoning , ahead of @entity28 and the norovirus , which is commonly associated with shellfish			1
it says that salmonella , which historically is linked to contaminated eggs but is also found in fresh produce , causes the most admissions to hospital at about 2,500 a year			0
in most cases contamination with campylobacter and other food bugs leads to a short - term tummy bug			0
but they can have serious complications including paralysis and even death			0
the agency has re-calibrated the way it measures sickness linked to food to provide a new – and more reliable – estimate of the true scale of the problem			2
it reports : ‘ there are more than 500,000 cases of food poisoning a year from known pathogens			1
this figure would more than double if it included food poisoning cases from unknown pathogens			2
’ significantly , it said : ‘ poultry meat was the food linked to the most cases of food poisoning , with an estimated 244,000 cases every year			1
’ agency officials are so concerned about campylobacter contamination of chicken that it has launched a survey of the meat on sale in supermarkets with the intention of regularly publishing a ‘ name and shame ’ list			0
the first of these surveys is expected to be published in the next fortnight and the hope is that it will shame traders , forcing them to take more action to protect their customers			0

lead researcher , professor @entity88 , said : ‘ these findings will help the @entity16 to target its resources more effectively in tackling food poisoning			1
‘ they confirm that the @entity16 is right to put campylobacter at the top of its priority list			2
a watchdog has named campylobacter , which is most often found on raw chicken , as the biggest cause of food poisoning ‘ it is the biggest food safety problem we have and more needs to be done to tackle it			1
’ the @entity104 insists that supermarkets are already tackling the problem			0
a spokesman said : ‘ retailers fully support the @entity16 ’s objective to reduce campylobacter and are investing in their supply chains working with farmers and processors to identify controls			0
‘ measures implemented include introducing leak - proof packaging on all whole birds to control the spread of any contamination and provision of on - pack labelling which advises consumers on how to handle and prepare poultry			0
‘ @entity124 is killed by normal cooking so providing people prepare chicken properly and follow sensible hygiene practices they ’re at no risk			0
’ after poultry , the next greatest food poisoning risks are vegetables , fruit , nuts and seeds , responsible for 48,000 cases , followed by beef and lamb , with 43,000 .			2
