by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has hired a security guard for its reception area after claims @entity6 intimidated staff a council has been forced to hire a £ 30,000 - a - year security guard to protect staff from a single local resident who is ' intimidating ' workers			1
@entity2 recruited the guard to sit in its reception five days a week to ensure @entity6 does not enter the building			1
officials banned him from its premises in @entity19 , @entity20 , in 2011 but claim he has broken the restriction a number of times			1
@entity6 has a previous public order conviction for erecting an offensive sign aimed at a council officer he has been in dispute with			1
@entity29 , council chief executive , sent a letter in october last year which warned mr @entity6 his case would not be reviewed for another year after demonstrating a ' complete contempt ' for the ban			1
it said : ' despite my earlier letter you have acted in a flagrant breach of this ban and accessed our offices by force			2
' you behaved in a completely unacceptable and intimidating manner such that the police were called and you were subsequently arrested			0
' the council is not going to be threatened from doing everything it can to protect its staff			0
' it said the council had licence to prohibit entry by any person and added : ' if you ignore this letter we will take such steps as are necessary to enforce the ban			0
' instead the council said it would deal with any queries through mr @entity6 's wife @entity60 , landlady of a local pub , and who also manages around 180 tenants in properties in the council 's area			1
yesterday mr @entity6 branded the decision ' unfair ' and said it made running a business difficult			2
he said : ' i 've only ever visited to talk about queries and complaints			0
now they wo n't speak to me on the phone and i ca n't go to the offices			0
' when you have a concern you want it sorted straight away			0
mrs @entity79 is busy and it 's a lot for her to have to deal with			0
' he said it was a waste of public money which could be spent on improving and retaining council services instead			0
he added : ' the offices are a public place , how can they ban someone from it ? if i have n't committed an offence then i should n't be banned			1
' but mr @entity6 admitted previous disagreements he had with district council licensing officer @entity92 may have ' escalated the situation '			2
the council banned mr @entity6 from coming to their offices ( pictured ) in 2011 , but say he has violated the ban on several occasions			1
mr @entity6 has a previous conviction for erecting a sign aimed at a council officer it is understood the guard was been hired specifically to prevent mr @entity6 entering the premises in @entity19 , @entity20 , but the council has refused to confirm or deny this			1
private security companies in the area prodive guards for around £ 80 - a - year , meaning the council could be spending £ 30,000 - per - year on the officer			2
it is believed the guard has been in the post for at least a month			0
a spokesperson for the authority said : ' the council reviews security for our reception services periodically to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff working in customer services , and has concluded it warrants the presence of an @entity126 qualified security officer at the present time			1
' earlier this month @entity6 lost an appeal to have a conviction and sentence overturned after he was found guilty of causing a public order offence after making a sign attacking mr @entity92			2
the court ruled he would now have to pay a larger fine for the crime .			0
