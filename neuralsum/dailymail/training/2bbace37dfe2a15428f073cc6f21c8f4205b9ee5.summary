by @entity0 former x factor judge @entity1 appeared in court today for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal			1
the former @entity9 star , 25 , is said to have been caught referring to cocaine as ' white sweets ' during a newspaper sting			2
however causing as much of a stir as her ongoing legal woes was concern over the singer 's face which appeared noticeably puffy and swollen as she walked into court			1
in addition to a change in shape of her nose and fuller lips , @entity1 's face appeared slightly ' pulled back ' and swollen the singer was keen to hide her plumped - up pout as she left a beauty salon in @entity39 in october last year			1
in august last year , she also put her slimmer looking nose down to the fact she had lost weight			0
@entity1 's face looked markedly swollen and puffy as she strolled into court this morning she told the @entity45 at the time : ' it 's not a deliberate thing , and i really do n't give a toss about being skinny			1
that 's just not me			0
but when i lose weight it goes from my face , and everyone says my nose looks thinner			1
' i swear on my life i 've not had it done			0
i 've literally just lost weight , and it goes from my nose ! ' @entity67 , non surgical director from @entity69 commented : ‘ looking at the photos provided , @entity1 definitely looks like she has had some kind of temporary dermal filler to her lips and is a very popular treatment with women of @entity1 ’s age			0
@entity1 ’s lips looked thinner in earlier pictures			1
' the elongated and shiny forehead is a classic tell - tale sign of having injectable wrinkle treatment			0
' her cheeks also look fuller than in earlier photographs			0
' her skin looks quite taut and shiny which would suggest @entity1 has had regular facial peels / skin rejuvenation treatments			0
' it appears @entity1 has indulged in non-surgical treatments of late			0
however @entity1 is very young and less is more and i would encourage using less product and leaving more time in between treatments			0
' cosmetic and plastic surgeon , @entity84 ( @entity85 ) from the @entity86 says : ' i think @entity1 looks great but i can see the tell - tale signs of @entity89 , fillers in her lips and possibly in her cheeks too			2
' she looks like she ’s lost a bit of weight in her face as well which has made her lips look more sensuous and striking			2
' the former x factor judge is accused of arranging a transaction between @entity97 on sunday 's undercover reporter @entity98 and her friend , @entity99 , real name @entity99 , 35			2
@entity1 is facing charges after a sting operation by the @entity97 on sunday and she denies all charges the alleged deal is said to have been arranged at @entity39 's @entity105 on may 10 last year			1

the outfit was reminiscent of the dress worn by @entity124 on june 18 to her own court case at the @entity126 , where she was ultimately found not guilty			0
@entity1 's navy shift dress with white collar was similar to the out fir worn by @entity130 ( pictured right with husband @entity131 ) last week @entity1 , real name @entity1 , sat in the back row of the barristers ' seats , listening intently to arguments her counsel advanced			2
