by @entity0 last updated at 10:03 pm on 5th february 2012 @entity1 has referred 43 ngo workers , including 19 @entity3 , to trial before a criminal court for allegedly using illegal foreign funds to foment unrest			1
among the @entity3 sent to trial is @entity9 , the head of the @entity1 office of the @entity12 - based @entity11 and the son of @entity3 transportation secretary @entity14			1
the decision made today marked a sharp escalation of the dispute between @entity18 and @entity12 over @entity1 's crackdown on @entity3 - funded groups promoting democracy and human rights			1
facing trial in @entity1 : @entity9 ( left ) standing with his father , transportation secretary @entity14 ( right ) in @entity12 in 2009 the two countries have been close allies for more than three decades , but the campaign against the organisations has angered @entity12 , and jeopardised the $ 1.5 billion in aid @entity1 is set to receive from the @entity3 this year			1
@entity3 secretary of state @entity29 yesterday warned @entity1 's foreign minister that failure to resolve the dispute may lead to the loss of @entity3 aid			1
the @entity1 minister , @entity35 , responded today by saying the government can not interfere in the work of the judiciary			2
‘ we are doing our best to contain this but we can not actually exercise any influence on the investigating judges right now when it comes to the investigation , ’ @entity35 told reporters at a security conference in @entity41 , @entity42			0
also among those referred to trial are five @entity51 , two @entity42 and three non-egyptian @entity53 nationals			0
warning : @entity29 has warned @entity1 's foreign minister that failure to resolve the dispute may lead to the loss of @entity3 aid all 43 have been banned from leaving the country			1
a date has yet to be set for the start of the trial			0
the @entity1 investigation into the work of @entity63 in the country is closely linked to the political turmoil that has engulfed the nation since the ouster nearly a year ago of @entity68 , a close @entity3 ally who ruled @entity1 for nearly 30 years			1
the generals who took power after @entity68 's fall have accused ' foreign hands ' of being behind protests against their rule and frequently depict the protesters as receiving funds from abroad in a plot to destabilise the country			2
those allegations have cost the youth activists that spearheaded @entity68 's ouster support among a wider public that is sensitive to allegations of foreign meddling and which sees a conspiracy to destabilise @entity1 in nearly every move by a foreign nation			2
but todays decision to refer the 43 to trial raises questions about the @entity1 military 's motive to allow the issue to escalate so much that the valuable $ 1.3 billion it gets annually be placed in jeopardy			2
@entity12 also is set to give @entity1 $ 250 million in economic aid this year			0
continuing protests : protesters chant anti-government slogans during a protest condemning the death of soccer fans at @entity104 stadium , near the @entity105 in @entity18 this month the @entity3 assistance has allowed the @entity1 military to replace its relatively antiquated @entity109 - era weaponry with modern and sophisticated arms , ranging from fighter - bombers and transport aircraft to tanks and personnel carriers			1
the aid is closely but informally linked to @entity1 's continued adherence to its 1979 peace treaty with @entity118 , @entity12 's closest @entity120 ally			1
already , @entity1 authorities are preventing at least six @entity3 — including @entity14 — and four @entity122 from leaving the country , citing a probe opened last month when heavily armed security forces raided the offices of 17 pro-democracy and rights groups			1
@entity1 officials have defended the raid as part of a legitimate investigation into the groups ' work and funding			2
also today , security officials said @entity68 , 83 , would shortly be moved to a prison for the first time since his arrest last april			0
@entity68 has since his arrest been kept in custody in a hospital at the @entity143 resort of @entity144 and later at an army 's medical facility east of @entity18			0
security officials said @entity68 ( pictured being wheeled into a courtroom last september ) would shortly be moved to a prison for the first time since his arrest last april they said interior minister @entity150 pledged in a meeting today to upgrade the medical facility in @entity149 south of @entity18 in ' record time , ' but did not set a date for the move			0
@entity68 is on trial on charges of complicity in the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 18 - day uprising that forced him to step down			0
the officials also said that around 50 former regime insiders held at @entity149 would be dispersed to five different jails in the greater @entity18 area within the next 48 hours			0
they include @entity68 's two sons , businessman @entity168 and one - time heir apparent @entity169 , two former prime ministers and the former speakers of parliament 's two chambers			0
the decision to move @entity68 and spread the regime officials appeared to be a concession by the military to pro-reform activists who complain that the ruling generals led by @entity68 's defense minister for 20 years were treating the ousted leader with reverence and turning a blind eye to former regime officials clustered in @entity149 to use supporters to undermine security .			0
