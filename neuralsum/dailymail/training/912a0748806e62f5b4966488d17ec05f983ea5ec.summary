it has been a tale of one coach , seven captains and 49 debutants			2
those are some of the figures that lay behind the southern hemisphere hoodoo that continued to haunt @entity7 as @entity8 suffered a tenth straight defeat at the hands of @entity11			1
some say it is a psychological barrier , but @entity8 were simply not good enough at the @entity14			1
after leaking three sloppy first - half tries , they somehow found themselves ahead with six minutes left on the clock			1
cue two late kicks from @entity11 fly - half @entity20 as the hosts once again coughed up a winning position – and not for the first time in their run of 21 consecutive defeats to the ‘ big three ’			1
it is a painful never - ending story that simply does n’t want to finish , made worse by injuries across the back - line to @entity30 and @entity31			1

this was a chance to lay down a final marker before the two countries meet at next year ’s @entity33 , but @entity7 believes his side , who face @entity92 next week , still have more to offer			2
‘ there ’s going to be a different beast that ’s facing @entity11 in that pool game , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ our time together will be a big upward curve and we ’ll continue to get better			0
we have pushed the players right to the edge over the last two weeks but there are a lot of things we did n’t cover			0
’ @entity7 was keen to take positives from the defeat , but that will not appease supporters who watched @entity8 make too many mistakes			2
training has been focussed on fitness , but a lack of skills work was exposed			0
‘ it ’s pretty frustrating , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ i ’m not happy with the result but i ’m pretty happy with the performance ; the way we played and how positively we played			0
we missed two one - on - one tackles , which they ’ve scored , and we threw an intercept pass			2
for a side that ’s just come together , i think we showed a huge amount of positives			2
’ the @entity35 game plan was clear from the start			0
after @entity36 clumsily knocked on from the kick off , the @entity11 shipped the ball wide and had @entity127 run into @entity39 ’s outside - centre channel within 30 seconds			1
only a captain ’s turnover from @entity49 brought an end to the early onslaught			0
@entity7 was bold with his selection			0
experienced front - row @entity134 will play no part in this series , while fellow @entity137 @entity58 and @entity54 were both dropped to the bench for the opening fixture			2
in - form @entity42 took the place of @entity58 and the gamble paid early dividends when the 25 - year - old went over for the opening try after three minutes			1
@entity31 , @entity30 and @entity49 all combined in attack , before the no 9 sniped from the base of the breakdown for the try , which @entity30 converted			2
@entity8 ' @entity42 runs in the first try of the match in the third minute after a terrific break from captain @entity49 @entity11 's @entity65 is driven back by @entity42 and @entity51 early on at the @entity14 @entity34 strikes again after an intercept on the @entity11 defensive 22m line and runs the length of the pitch build up in the @entity160 camp has been geared towards narrowing the speed deficit between the regional competition and the southern hemisphere @entity164 tournament			1
while gps data has showed that most @entity160 players are used to covering 55 metres per minute at club level , their @entity35 counterparts are used to playing at above 75mpm			0
the objective was to play at that speed , while keeping errors to a minimum			0
but the home defence cracked after a quarter of an hour			0
@entity11 skipper @entity74 used his low centre of gravity to plough through a weak tackle from @entity31 , finding @entity34 on his inside shoulder for a dash over the line			2
@entity20 converted to level the score			1
it was disappointing to see empty seats at the @entity14 , but that is the side - effect of charging £ 60 for a general sale ticket			2
supporters would rather save their money to watch the @entity187 in two weeks time and they would expect to see far less mistakes than experienced in the first half on saturday afternoon			0
while @entity42 showed his danger with the opening try , he was at fault for handing the visitors a 21st minute lead			2
after @entity40 broke through the defence , @entity8 played up until the unlucky 13th phase , when @entity42 through a 20 - yard miss pass that was intercepted by @entity34			1
no one was going to catch the mercurial full - back as he cantered in from 80 metres			0
@entity11 winger @entity63 takes to the air above @entity36 ( left ) @entity36 scores @entity8 ' second try after a rampaging run from @entity39 @entity64 busts through a tackle on the burst and beats @entity40 ( right ) for the @entity35 ' third try of the first half wales celebrate their third try through @entity47 in time added on in the first half @entity39 was seen as a weak link given his unfamiliar position , but the @entity215 winger made the break to bring @entity8 back into the game			1
with the @entity35 defence all at sea , the 22 - year - old cut inside @entity63 to create the opening for @entity8 ’ second try			1
@entity36 got on @entity39 ’s shoulder and exploited a two - on - one to level the score with the aid of @entity30 ’s conversion			1
then struck a huge double blow for the hosts , as @entity30 was turned over and concussed at the same breakdown			0
it signalled the end of his game and @entity64 – the cousin of @entity11 legend @entity233 – broke through the tackle of @entity36 and @entity47 , punishing @entity160 errors with another easy try			1
he was to be joined on the injury list by @entity31 , who suffered a strained groin			0
‘ we ’ll have to sit down as a group and bring another 10 in for next week , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ we ’ll see how the next 48 hours go with @entity30			0
it ’s an opportunity for us to give him a rest next week and perhaps look at @entity41 at full back			0
‘ the introduction of @entity60 for @entity30 allowed @entity8 to revert to a more familiar line - up , with @entity39 switching back to the wing			1
the @entity160 forwards had not dominated up front as they expected , but just before half - time @entity49 tapped a quick penalty , allowing @entity47 to crash over and leave the half time score at 21 - 21			1
scrum - half @entity20 potted the first penalty attempt of the match early in the second half to put @entity11 back in the lead @entity8 skipper @entity49 leads from the front with a strong run at the @entity35 defensive line with three @entity137 and more than 300 international caps on the bench , @entity8 were able to unload a wealth of experience in the second half			1
two further penalties from @entity20 edged the hosts back in front and @entity7 sent on both @entity58 and @entity54			1
the @entity8 front - five was expected to dominate the scrum , but did little more than hold their own			1
only the introduction of @entity54 along with @entity53 in the front - row seemed to provide the impetus			0
a huge drive provided @entity8 with go forwards ball and @entity39 almost crashed over after 61 minutes , only to be denied by the @entity274			2
five minutes of re-set scrums followed and referee @entity276 eventually awarded a penalty try , to the delight of the home crowd			0
replacement fly half @entity59 converted to give his side a one - point lead			1
@entity8 had been in this position in so many times before and the curse of the late score has become their hoodoo			2
history was about to repeat itself			0
@entity11 built up the phases and @entity20 got in position for the drop goal			1
he made no mistake , before adding a second from the tee to rub salt in the wounds ; it was to be another case of @entity160 deja vu			0
wales dominate the @entity35 scrum under the posts for a series of penalties and resets before being given a penalty try @entity20 , chosen ahead of @entity306 , slots a field goal to put @entity11 back in the lead in the second half the @entity310 and the @entity311 share a laugh with other vips in the stands at the @entity14			1

the sides scored six converted tries between them to finish the first half *deadlocked* at 21 - 21
@entity42 , @entity36 and @entity47 crossed for @entity8 before a second - half penalty try
@entity127 scored a *quickfire* first - half double with the other try to a rampaging @entity64
@entity20 kicked three penalties and a field goal in the second period to clinch the *victory*
@entity11 coach @entity333 's first official test match in charge of the side against @entity8
