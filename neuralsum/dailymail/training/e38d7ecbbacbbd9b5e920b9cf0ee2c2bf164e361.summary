this middle class woman has been unveiled as one of the trolls accused of targeting vile internet abuse at @entity5 's parents			1
@entity6 is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the @entity9 , whose daughter disappeared during a family holiday to @entity13 in 2007			1
detectives have decided to act after being given a dossier from @entity17 family supporters which catalogues the abusive remarks – including death threats – aimed at the couple on @entity21 , @entity22 and online forums			2
and @entity24 , 63 , who has posted dozens of messages attacking the @entity9 using the @entity21 handle @ sweepyface , has been identified as one of them			1
when asked why she was using her @entity21 account to attack the @entity9 , who live with their younger children , nine - year - old twins , in @entity47 , @entity38 , mrs @entity24 replied : ' i 'm entitled to do that			1
' and when mr @entity39 told her that she had been reported to police , and that @entity6 was considering a dossier of @entity21 accounts said to show a ' campaign of abuse ' against the @entity9 , she paused as she got into a 4x4 and replied : ' that 's fair enough			1
' the crime correspondent said he was later invited into mrs @entity24 's house , where she told him she ' had questions for the @entity9 ' but ' hoped she had n't broken the law ' by posting tweets in which she spread rumours about the @entity9 ' marriage , and said she hoped they would suffer for ever			2
the messages were among those posted by internet trolls who wrongly believe that @entity68 and @entity69 , both 46 , had some involvement in the disappearance of their three - year - old daughter @entity72 in @entity13 in 2007			2
the couple , who were cleared by police from any part in their daughter 's disappearance , have been told by trolls to ' burn in hell '			1
troll : mrs @entity24 , 63 , lives in @entity36 , @entity38 - the same country as @entity39 and mrs @entity17 these are some of the abusive messages , including one by @ sweepyface , top right , directed at the @entity9 some messages are even directed at @entity72 's younger twin siblings , now aged nine			1
according to @entity40 , ' manipulated images ' involving the @entity9 – many of them graphic – are also in wide circulation online			0
the majority of those who post the vile messages use anonymous social media accounts , so their true identities are disguised			1
but detectives , who are now in talks with the @entity99 after being handed a 65 - page dossier on the campaign of abuse , are confident they can identify the culprits			0
the dossier – compiled by members of the public who sympathise with the @entity9 – calls on police and mps to crack down on such abuse			1
under the 2003 @entity111 , it is an offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive			2
abuse : the messages have been posted by internet trolls who wrongly believe that @entity68 and @entity69 had some involvement in the disappearance of their daughter @entity72 in @entity13 in 2007 among the messages in the dossier is an exchange on a message board which reads : ' these two should burn in hell ' … ' i will supply the petrol ' … ' i 'll supply the lighter – happily '			1
other posts include : ' we need some numbers for some assassins ' and ' i want to see them … trampled by horses			0
' also , several trolls claim to live near to the @entity9			0
one troll who claimed to live in their village posted : ' i 'm going round with the cuffs and bags			0
' another troll who claimed to live locally said : ' @entity144 at the gym today , gave her a look of utter disgust , managed to hold my tongue though			0
' the dossier 's authors claim that at least six @entity21 accounts have been set up principally to abuse the @entity9 and their supporters			2
the campaigner spearheading the appeal – who has asked to remain anonymous – told @entity40 : ' we 're very worried that it 's only going to take somebody to act out some of these discussions , some of the threats , and we could n't live with ourselves if that happened and we had done nothing			0
' former police chief and online child security expert @entity164 said : ' i 'm deeply concerned by the behaviours displayed … i think the time has come for the hardcore few in the midst of this group to be investigated			0
' a spokesman for @entity6 said today : ' we can confirm we have received a letter and documentation on 9 september which was passed to officers from @entity177 [ the police review into @entity72 's disappearance ]			2
' they are assessing its contents and consulting with the cps and the @entity17 family			0
' detective inspector @entity184 of the @entity185 told the campaign group : ' in consultation with the @entity99 and the @entity17 family , the material will now be assessed and decisions made as to what further action , if any , should be undertaken			0
' last night the @entity9 declined to comment			0
