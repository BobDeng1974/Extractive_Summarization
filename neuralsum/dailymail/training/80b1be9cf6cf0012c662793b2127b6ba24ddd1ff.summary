sir @entity10 will quit next march with a taxpayer - funded pension pot worth nearly £ 2million			1
his position has been under intense scrutiny after a major report implicated him in the @entity17 hospital disaster , where up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died needlessly			1
sir @entity10 was grilled by mps over the official report into serious failings at @entity22 campaigners had repeatedly called for sir @entity10 to resign over the @entity3 scandal he has also been accused of presiding over a @entity26 culture across the health service , in which doctors , nurses and managers are afraid to speak out about poor care			1
@entity32 , of @entity33 the @entity3 , said it was ' fantastic news ' that sir @entity10 was to leave the health service last night bereaved families and mps questioned the size of his pension and demanded to know why he was n’t leaving immediately			1
although he is due to stay on for another ten months , he told @entity43 he may leave earlier if a suitable replacement is found			0
sir @entity10 , who is 57 , would normally be expected to retire when he reached the age of 60			0
even in his resignation letter to @entity47 , chairman of @entity48 , he refused to apologise for the @entity17 fiasco			1
he merely said : ‘ whilst i believe we have made significant progress together under my leadership , recent events continue to show that on occasion the @entity3 can still sometimes fail patients , their families and carers			1
‘ this continues to be a matter of profound regret to me but please note that on a daily basis i continue , and will always continue , to be inspired and moved by the passion that those who work in the @entity3 continue to show			2
’ that did little to appease @entity32 , who set up campaign group cure the @entity3 after her mother @entity67 died at the trust			1
describing his pension as ‘ an obscene amount of money for failure ’ , she said : ‘ he ’s going with his knighthood and pension still intact			0
' he ’ll have a happy retirement , unlike us who have been left with awful memories of watching our loved ones suffer			0
‘ we are disappointed he is not going immediately but hopefully this is a chance to finally change the @entity3			2
we can start to look to the future now			0
he was part of the problem – not part of the solution			0
' we now need a leader who will galvanise and inspire the front line , not bully them			0
’ ' cure the @entity3 ' campaigners demanded sir @entity10 resign but he insisted he would stay on in his £ 200,000 job sir @entity10 has worked in the @entity3 since 1977 , the same year he joined the @entity93			1
after working in mental health for a decade , he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the @entity98 and @entity99 at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died			1
in 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the @entity105 , in charge of a £ 90billion budget and 1.3million staff			1
he claimed £ 50,000 - a - year in expenses on top of a salary of his £ 211,000 salary , £ 20,000 bonus and around £ 47,000 of ‘ benefits in kind '			1
the package was criticised at a time when his ' @entity118 ' was imposing £ 20billion in efficiency savings on the @entity3			2
he insisted he had to travel by first - class to do his job , but refused to explain to mps why his expense claims included 41 first - class trips to @entity125 , where his 35 - year - old wife lives with their baby daughter			0
he was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the @entity3 where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out			2
in a three - year period under his rule a total of £ 14.7 million was spent on almost 600 ‘ compromise agreements ' preventing ex-employees from speaking out			0
@entity140 mp @entity139 , who put down a @entity142 motion calling for sir @entity10 to resign , said : ‘ it is a terrible indictment of our political system that he has not already been fired			1
‘ it is an even worse indictment that in an era where we talk about accountability , he should walk away to an enormous pension , funded by the public			0
’ @entity155 is @entity140 mp for @entity156 , and some of his constituents died at @entity158			1
he said : ‘ his position was untenable , he had lost confidence of 90 per cent of @entity3 staff and more importantly of the patients			2
‘ he should go sooner – as soon as a suitable replacement is found			0
i believe we need a new era of honesty and candour within the @entity3 and that has to start from the top			0
‘ the fact he has n’t apologised for the awful events of @entity17 and elsewhere and his huge pension will undoubtedly rankle with many			0
’ sir @entity10 has faced calls to quit since february , when a high profile report linked him to the appalling neglect of patients at @entity22 between 2005 and 2009			2
relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they resorted to drinking dirty water from vases , while nurses said they left wards in tears because care was so poor			0
sir @entity10 was accused of not taking action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the trust , and later when appointed @entity3 chief executive in 2006			1
in fact at the height of the scandal , in october 2005 , he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing letter to managers praising them for hitting targets			0
but he has repeatedly insisted that at the time he had ‘ no idea ’ of the unfolding scandal and maintained that the failings were ‘ system wide ’			0
he came under further pressure when it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about another trust , @entity207 , where 670 patients may have died needlessly			2
sir @entity10 , who earns £ 211,000 a year , became known as the ‘ man with no shame ’ because of his stance over the scandals			1
sir @entity10 ’s pension pot is currently worth just under £ 1.9million , although this will almost certainly increase with inflation by the time he is due to leave , when it is likely to be more than £ 2million			1
although his retirement was announced only yesterday , @entity218 officials are believed to have been planning it for some time , having realised his position was untenable			0
and while his letter of resignation had yesterday ’s date at the top , it includes a paragraph which refers to preparations for reforms beginning on april 1 , suggesting it was written in march			2
the @entity230 understands that bosses at @entity48 were lining up possible successors three months ago , despite publicly giving sir @entity10 their full backing			0
health secretary @entity234 said : ‘ [ sir @entity10 ’s ] job has often been incredibly complex and very difficult , and yet he has always had a reputation for staying calm , and maintaining a relentless focus on what makes a difference on the @entity3 frontline			2
’ the @entity242 into failings at @entity22 found up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died as a result of poor care			1
