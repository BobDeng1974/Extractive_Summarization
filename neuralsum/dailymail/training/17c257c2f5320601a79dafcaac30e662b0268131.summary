crucial @entity1 files relating to allegations of child sex abuse in the 1980s are still missing , it emerged last night			1
a dossier seen as key to claims ministers were warned about allegations of @entity10 abuse as not been found by an inquiry set up to examine the @entity1 's handling of the complaints			1
it was claimed former @entity16 mp @entity15 handed the papers to the @entity1 detailing allegations of abuse			1
@entity19 chief executive @entity18 has carried out a review into @entity1 handling of historic allegations of child abuse a review into the case by @entity19 chief executive @entity18 is to be published next week			1
mr @entity15 , who died in 1995 , said he gave details of @entity10 paedophiles – known as ‘ @entity29 dossier ’ – to then home secretary @entity30 in 1983			1
a source told @entity33 's @entity32 : ' they have looked inside and behind every single cupboard in the department , and they have been round them twice , and they have not been able to find any of them			0
' former home secretary @entity30 has flatly denied failing to deal with a dossier provided by mr @entity15 in 1983 properly , while a review carried out by a @entity41 official last year found no evidence that relevant material was not passed to other authorities			1
but it also disclosed that the @entity15 file appeared to have been destroyed - and the permanent secretary at the @entity1 , @entity47 , has since revealed that 114 files deemed potentially relevant are missing			1
mp @entity49 , told the @entity33 : ' i am worried @entity18 has been set up to fail in many respects			1
' i do n't think he was given enough time to carry out this investigation			0
i do n't think he was provided with enough support within the @entity1 and i am worried he did n't get the technological support			2
' it comes after current home secretary @entity58 apologised in the @entity59 in the wake of the resignation of the second chairwoman appointed to lead a wider inquiry into historic child sex abuse			1
former @entity16 mp @entity15 ( left ) , who died in 1995 , said he gave details of establishment paedophiles – known as ‘ @entity29 dossier ’ – to then home secretary @entity30 ( right ) in 1983 home secretary @entity58 apologised in the @entity59 in the wake of the resignation of the second chairwoman appointed to lead a wider inquiry into historic child sex abuse @entity71 , the lord mayor of london , resigned last friday following disclosures about her links to @entity30 , prompting mrs may to announce the inquiry would have to begin without a chairman next wednesday			1
@entity77 mp @entity76 said he was concerned that civil servants who dealt with the dossier at the time had not come forward to give evidence to mr @entity18 because they are forbidden to reveal information about it by the @entity84			1
mr @entity76 told @entity85 's today programme : ' i 've spoken to a civil servant who saw the file at the time , back in the ' 80s , and had to sign the @entity84			0
many more did as well , not just in the @entity1			2
' while i understand the file is really a list of names and not much more than that , i 've also spoken to a journalist who 's still alive today - @entity95 - who was given a list of names , but more importantly a whole series of @entity1 minutes of meetings looking into this issue , by the @entity101			1
' all those files very quickly - a couple of days after he was given them by @entity104 - were seized by the security services and @entity106			0
' this information came to light to me after @entity18 had finished his work			2
' asked if he was impressed by mr @entity18 's investigation , mr @entity76 said : ' it does n't seem to me it 's getting anywhere near asking the questions			2
' if one civil servant saw the file , and says many others did as well , and does n't want to speak out because of the restrictions of the @entity84 , then that 's what @entity18 needed to be asking questions about			2
' he added : ' i 'm aware of some of the names			0
they are not all household names			0
the well - known ones , it 's inconceivable that there would n't be interest from the intelligence services , because they could be blackmailed			0
it would be improper for the @entity1 not to pass that on at the time			2
' there are ongoing police investigations into some of these people			0
i 'm aware of at least seven prominent people where there are ongoing live police investigations , and there are other names given where there 's not in my view sufficient evidence in themselves to launch anything other than asking around			0
' with a number of them , victims have come forward and they are very prominent people			0
so the issue is not going to go away			0
' there are civil servants , maybe retired now , who do know a lot and they have not come forward to @entity153 , and that 's a problem			0
