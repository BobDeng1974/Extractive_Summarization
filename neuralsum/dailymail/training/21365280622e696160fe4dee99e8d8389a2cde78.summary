' coming from @entity18 , i was friends with a lot of the fashion designers			1
i grew up in a world around models and supermodels and designers and fashion			2
in @entity31 , they were very much like , " what is that ? i do n't really know what that is , " ' she says			2
small - screen style : @entity2 ( pictured wearing a @entity39 dress in april 2014 ) takes credit for her character 's impeccable wardrobe on @entity3 , in a new interview with @entity13 she added : ' i was like , if there was one benefit to having a character like @entity16 [ it ] is that she has access to things			1
it 's that kind of access that made her fascinating to watch			2
watching people in the bubble is what people get so fascinated by			2
i mean that is fully what the @entity3 was about : there 's the people in the bubble , and then there 's the regular , old people around them			2
@entity16 was definitely in the bubble			1
' miss @entity2 reveals that she had trouble getting into character , but found a connection to @entity16 when she wore her impeccable ensembles - many of which she chose			1

not in a bad way , we would have looked adorable , but we would have been just your average @entity102 teenagers			0
but with my wiling and conniving i was like , " you know what would be super great is if we could get this @entity67 dress for this [ prom ] episode , " and it kind of all came together			0
