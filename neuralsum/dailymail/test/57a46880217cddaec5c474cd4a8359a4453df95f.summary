' a family tragedy ' : @entity1 in @entity2 the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the £ 60million @entity6 gem heist said yesterday that he believes it was an inside job			1
@entity1 , who lives in @entity8 , said detectives have asked to put some ‘ sensitive ’ questions to his @entity12 - based son who runs the business , including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs			1
and he said the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several cctv cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in			1
speaking for the first time about the crime mr @entity1 , 69 , also told of his fury at police for ignoring an alert from a state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were forcing their way into 72 safe deposit boxes during the @entity37 holiday			1
he described the robbery as a ‘ tragedy ’ for his family after the business had just started to make a small profit following years of losses			2
mr @entity1 is a joint director of @entity44 with eldest son @entity45 , who lives in @entity46 , north - west @entity47 , and usually runs the business full - time			1
but when the robbery happened @entity45 , 38 , was on a month - long holiday with his wife and child in @entity8			1
in his absence , the business was being managed by younger brother @entity55 , 29			2
their downcast father told the @entity58 : ‘ to many this robbery is like something out of a @entity63 fiction film , but to my family it is a tragedy			0
it is the end of the business my son has worked so hard to build slowly over the last seven years			2
‘ it was making a loss when he bought it and only first made a profit last year , and even then it was very little			2
before then we were relying on loans from banks as we worked to make it a success			0
now the business is finished			2
mr @entity81 said robbers almost certainly had some inside information it is estimated that anything from £ 60million to £ 200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company ’s vaults in @entity47 ’s diamond district			1
mr @entity1 was in @entity91 on unrelated business when news broke about the robbery , but rushed back to @entity8 to be with his eldest son who was himself frantically trying to arrange a return from @entity2 to the @entity12 with his family , which took several days			1
he said : ‘ the police called @entity45 on his phone in @entity8 to tell him what happened and said we want you to come back to @entity47 because there are sensitive issues we want to talk to you about			1
‘ they told him they wanted to ask him questions that only he could answer about the business			0
the police want to know from @entity45 if he suspects someone inside who could have contact with a gang			1
’ several retired detectives have already speculated that the gang must have had inside knowledge before sneaking into the block , abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft - thick concrete wall to reach the security boxes			2
the @entity44 company is in a building which accommodates 60 other businesses			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ there must be suspicion on everyone who worked in that building			1
’ it is estimated that anything from £ 60million to £ 200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company ’s vaults in @entity47 ’s diamond district over the @entity37 weekend the robbers set off an intruder alarm just after midnight on @entity136 and the @entity137 contacted the @entity139 ’s @entity138			1
police recorded the call , but graded it so that ‘ no police response was deemed to be required ’			0
‘ it is incredible that the police did not act on this , ’ said mr @entity1			1
‘ the police knew in advance that it would be closed over @entity37 so they must have realised nobody was meant to be in the vaults			0
’ mr @entity1 , who was born in @entity8 from @entity150 heritage , is a well - respected businessman in the @entity152 country and a former president of the @entity154			1
he runs the @entity155 , which imports electrical goods to @entity8			0
police are examining startling similarities between the @entity6 heist and a bank raid in @entity161 two years ago			0
one line of inquiry is that a crew of specialist @entity166 thieves may have travelled to the @entity12 for the raid at @entity37			0
the operation was the mirror image of one on the vault of the @entity172 in @entity173 , south - west @entity161 , in january 2013			2
thieves made off with diamonds , gold and silver worth more than £ 8.3million from 294 safety deposit boxes after drilling through 80cm – around two and a half feet – of reinforced concrete			0
the gang spent weeks digging a tunnel from a rented parking space to reach the walls of the underground vault			0
they then drilled four massive holes in the wall after the bank closed on a friday afternoon			0
the wooden boards used to construct the tunnel came from @entity191 , and bottles of @entity191 beer were left behind			0
in both the @entity47 and @entity161 raids police suspect an insider passed on vital information that enabled the thieves to work out how to beat security systems			2
police in @entity200 obtained dna samples of some members of the gang , but they have never been traced			0
the @entity161 bank is still negotiating with more than 100 deposit box owners who did not have theft insurance .			0

69 - year - old said robbers almost certainly had some inside information
