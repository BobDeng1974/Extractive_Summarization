by @entity0 @entity1 has entered into mortal combat with some of the world ’s most dangerous criminals on countless occasions – yet always beats the odds and walks away with his life			2
now one eagle - eyed fan has calculated the exact probability of 007 dodging death so many times – and come to the conclusion he should have died years ago			0
@entity13 worked out that the spy had been shot at a staggering 4,662 times since the first film , dr no , in 1962			0
death defying : @entity19 , pictured in 2006 's @entity20 , is one of several @entity21 to have improbably dodged death over the years the survival of @entity25 like @entity26 is all the more surprising given the spy normally , unlike this picture , finds himself unarmed when faced with death he then estimated there was a 5 per cent chance of the spy being fatally wounded on each occasion			1
expressed mathematically , this means the chance of @entity1 not getting killed is 1.4 x 10 to the power of minus 104 , or in mr @entity13 ’s words , ‘ as close to zero as makes no difference ’			1
when you take into account the 130 other attempts on @entity1 ’s life that did not involve being shot at , the chances of him surviving are even slimmer			2
there have been 22 official @entity1 movies and the attempts on 007 ’s life have grown increasingly sinister			1
in the 1964 film @entity47 , @entity1 was handcuffed to a ticking bomb and strapped to a table underneath a giant laser			2
mr @entity13 estimates that over the years @entity1 ( played by @entity52 , left , and @entity53 , right ) has killed 198 of his enemies in the films when the agent asks : ‘ do you expect me to talk ? ’ the film ’s eponymous villain replies : ‘ no , mr @entity1 , i expect you to die			1
’ @entity1 ’s survival rate is even more staggering when you consider he is rarely armed when he finds himself in a fight to the death			0
his survival is often due to his use of household appliances , such as lamps or abandoned objects			0
mr @entity13 , who lives in the @entity69 , also estimates that @entity71 ’s most famous agent has killed 198 of his enemies in the films			1
mr @entity13 constructed his formula after @entity75 magazine asked its readers to work out what was the probability of @entity1 still being alive			0
the 23rd @entity1 film , @entity79 , which will star @entity19 , @entity80 and @entity81 , is currently being filmed .			0

chance of @entity1 not being killed over the years is ' as close to zero as makes no difference '
