by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:33 est , 23 february 2014 @entity3 : 18:33 est , 23 february 2014 @entity4 said career women need a pre-nup law to help them protect their earnings from predatory men career women need a pre-nup law to help them protect their earnings from predatory men , an influential lawyer said yesterday			1
a law to allow couples to settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding would stop men marrying successful women and then running off with a large share of their wealth , @entity4 said			1
the call from the prominent family lawyer and pro-marriage campaigner came five days before @entity26 advisers publish their own plans for a pre-nup law			1
however , any plans for marriage reform from the @entity31 could not become law before the 2015 election			1
@entity34 said she intends to bring a pre-nup @entity35 this week with the aim of getting a law before the election			2
her intervention comes at a time of intensifying debate between supporters of a pre-nup law , which they say would stop gold - diggers and allow a couple to control their own break - up , and opponents who say that a pre-nup law would dangerously undermine the role of marriage as a lifelong partnership			1
@entity34 said on @entity53 ’s @entity52 : ‘ lots of young women these days are working , earning well , and would feel it extremely unfair if a young man who they marry and perhaps leaves them is going to take with him a sizeable chunk of what they have worked so hard for			2
‘ the position of women has changed in the last 40 years and it ’s time to recognise that in this country , like virtually every country in the world , two people who are getting married ought to be able , if they want , to make a contract about how their assets are to be divided if they divorce			2
’ she said the institution of marriage has been so damaged already by easy divorce that pre-nups could do no more harm			0
‘ the law is very odd , ’ she said			0
according to the @entity4 , a law to allow couples to settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding would stop men marrying successful women and then running off with a large share of their wealth ‘ it takes no account of fault whatsoever			1
' so an awful lot of people end up having to give up homes , children and pensions feeling , rightly or wrongly , that they are innocent and the other one is guilty			0
‘ the law is in a sad , sad way , but it ’s too late – divorce is very prevalent and i do think that pre-nups might make people think very carefully about how dreadful it might be to end it			0
‘ secondly it would save them so much money , so much hostility and bitterness , if unfortunately it does come to an end			0
’ but the @entity112 of @entity113 , the right reverend @entity114 , told the programme : ‘ my concern is the message that this is likely to be sending to a diminishing number of couples who are seeking the life - long commitment to marriage when we are asking them to prepare their divorce settlement before they have even married			2
’ proposals drawn up by the @entity31 are likely to contain proposals for a new pre-nup law			1
ministers have , however , indicated that there is no chance of legislation before the election			0
@entity134 courts have traditionally ignored pre-nup agreements and instead tried to divide a couples ’ assets on merit			0
but the practice was undermined in 2010 when @entity141 judges ruled that @entity143 heiress @entity142 should keep her £ 100million fortune after her divorce in accordance with the terms of her pre-nup .			0
