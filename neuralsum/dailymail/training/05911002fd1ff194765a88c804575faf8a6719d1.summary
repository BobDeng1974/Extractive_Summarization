by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 21:44 est , 25 december 2012 support : prime minister @entity2 initially backed setting the contribution cap for people who need residential care at £ 35,000			1
now it could be £ 60,000 or even £ 75,000 middle - class couples who need residential care in old age could be hit with bills as high as £ 150,000			1
under @entity14 plans to be unveiled in the @entity15 , the upper limit on the amount that must be contributed towards care could be £ 60,000 or even £ 75,000 per person			1
this ‘ cap ’ is much higher than the £ 35,000 suggested by last year ’s independent review into @entity19 ’s care funding system			1
if both husband and wife end up moving into residential care , it could mean they will have to pay out up to £ 150,000 before the state steps in			1
in addition , they will still have to meet accommodation costs – the ‘ bed and board ’ charge for care home stays			2
this could push the total outlay to almost £ 200,000			0
critics say setting the cap so high will do little to stop thousands of pensioners having to sell their homes each year , denying their children an inheritance			2
and they are likely to accuse @entity2 of letting the elderly down , as @entity42 has previously attracted positive coverage by backing the review ’s proposal of a £ 35,000 cap			1
at present , care home residents can be landed with unlimited charges if they have assets , including their house , of more than £ 23,500			2
those who have no savings get care completely free			0
ministers have pledged to increase this threshold to £ 100,000 , meaning people will no longer see their savings depleted to below this level			2
but the benefit could be wiped out by the imposition of a cap that is more than double the amount that was originally expected			0
in addition , it is understood that the new system may not even be put in place until as late as 2017 , despite promises to sort the issue out before the next general election , due in 2015			0
at least 20,000 elderly people have to sell their homes every year to pay unlimited care costs			1
last year , a government - commissioned report by economist @entity72 concluded that a lifetime cap should be imposed of between £ 35,000 and £ 50,000 , with the state stepping in to pay the rest			1
at that time , a senior @entity77 source told the @entity78 : ‘ the prime minister said “ we ’ve got to do @entity81			0
we ’re going to do this ”			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ i hope to be able to announce the way forward by the next election but we ’ve got to find the money first			2
it seems to me absolutely vital			0
’ he added that he was confident the funding would be found			0
but chancellor @entity88 balked at the estimated £ 1.7billion a year cost at a time when he is trying to bring down @entity92 ’s deficit			0
betrayal : the £ 75,000 proposed cap would be more than double the amount recommended by economist @entity72 to bring down the cost , it seems ministers are considering a higher cap of £ 60,000 or perhaps even £ 75,000 , meaning the state will not be called upon to pay as much			1
the cap would be for individuals , meaning that couples could be asked to pay £ 150,000			1
in addition , the cap only covers the cost of nursing and personal care , such as help with washing and dressing			2
it does not include the ‘ bed and board ’ cost of food and heating , which add up to between £ 7,000 and £ 10,000 a year			0
residents would have to pay this on top of their care fees , potentially pushing the total cost towards the £ 200,000 level			2
@entity124 sources said that no final decision had been taken on the level of the cap , but that ‘ the higher end of what has been speculated is most likely ’			0
professor @entity72 also suggested that the assets threshold of £ 23,500 , below which people have to pay nothing towards their residential care , should be raised substantially to £ 100,000			1
it is likely that ministers will respect this part of his recommendations			0
last night @entity139 , director general of the over- @entity140 , said such a high cap would be a ‘ betrayal ’ of pensioners			0
‘ a £ 75,000 cap is too high and would still mean most middle - class families , especially outside @entity146 , would lose their home and life savings because the cap excludes accommodation costs which will be many thousands more , ’ she said			1
‘ this high a cap would not allow an insurance market to develop and is more than double the £ 35,000 recommended by @entity81			1
’ the social care plan is one of the key parts of a @entity14 ‘ mid-term review ’ , which will also involve a commitment to introduce a single - tier state pension of about £ 140 a week			0
the review will include measures to cut the cost of childcare , and is expected to commit ministers to new ways to fund the motorway and trunk road network , such as by handing construction and maintenance to the private sector			0
a @entity173 spokesperson said : ' we want this country to be one of the best places in @entity177 to grow old and that is why in july we announced the most extensive reforms of care and support in over 60 years			0
' as part of the reforms , we committed to taking action to ensure people do not have to sell their homes to pay for care			1
' we also agreed that the @entity188 's model of the cap on care costs is the right basis for any new funding model , but given the current economic situation , we need to look carefully at how we can pay for this			1

couples could face £ 150,000 care bill under new plans
@entity2 initially backed £ 35,000 contribution cap , now it could be £ 75,000
older people face selling their homes to cover costs
