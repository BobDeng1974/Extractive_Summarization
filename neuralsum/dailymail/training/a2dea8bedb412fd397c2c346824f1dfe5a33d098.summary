speaking at an event for aid charities in @entity21 , she said : ‘ i know there are many people in our country who think that international development should not be a priority - that instead we should spend the money here in @entity30			1
' they think that the money is spent on countries that do n’t use it effectively , or on projects that are n’t worthwhile			0
‘ and i know that the temptation for many of us when confronted by anyone arguing against you is just to argue back , just to shout louder at them			0
‘ but i came into politics because i believe that people have a right to be heard , and i believe that they have a right to be listened to			0
