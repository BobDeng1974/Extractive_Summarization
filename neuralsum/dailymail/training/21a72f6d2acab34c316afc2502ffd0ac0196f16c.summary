by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 06:10 est , 21 may 2012 linesmen and referees can make errors due to hot and cold conditions , a new @entity2 report claims - and urges that officials be allowed to double up numbers or be supported by goal line technology			1
the finding could have important implications for controversial decisions such as @entity12 's infamous ' @entity14 ' goal - and for the upcoming 2022 @entity15 in @entity16			1
professor @entity17 of the @entity18 said , ' we need to look at ways to help them cope with the conditions that they will face			0
' @entity12 's infamous ' hand of @entity14 ' goal past @entity25 : a new report presented to @entity2 suggests that referees can make bad decisions in hot climates @entity17 , of the @entity18 , found that physical performance and decision making of referees and linesmen were impaired when conditions were hot - similar to those likely to be found at the @entity36 in @entity16 , or cold , as is often the case in @entity38 and @entity39			1
he was funded for the study by the @entity42 football governing body , @entity2			2
he presented his findings to its @entity44 in @entity46 prior to next month ’s @entity47 in in @entity48 and @entity49			0
professor @entity17 said : ‘ these findings have serious implications for the performance of referees and goal line officials who are officiating in challenging climatic conditions			1
it could be argued that this even lends further weight to the argument in favour of goal line technology in important matches			2
’ professor @entity17 pointed out the referees and goal line officials would have to work in extremely hot conditions while taking part in the @entity15 in @entity16 in 2022			1
however , cold climates can also cause problems			2
‘ the decision making of the goal line officials would also be cause for concern if they are working in the cold conditions seen in the @entity47 and @entity39 leagues			2
our findings show that they are at risk of hyperthermia and making incorrect decisions , especially in the second half , ‘ he said			0
@entity17 , of the @entity18 , found that physical performance and decision making of referees and linesmen were impaired when conditions were hot - similar to those likely to be found at the @entity36 in @entity16 he said pre-match and half time cooling in hot conditions would lessen the chance of a referee making a mistake			1
he also recommended that all match officials should receive appropriate education in hydration strategies			0
for officials working in cold conditions , professor @entity17 suggested that they should be permitted to wear additional clothing and , potentially , for four officials to be considered per match , rather than the current two , allowing each to only officiate for 45 minutes			0
professor @entity17 added : ‘ when matches are played in extremely hot and cold conditions , the football authorities should observe the physical condition of match officials to ensure they are able to continue officiating effectively which may include measuring body temperature at half time			0
‘ the ultimate aim must be to protect the health of the officials , and ensure that they are in the best possible state to make correct decisions			0

both hot and cold climates can make referees and linesmen make errors
adds weight to arguments for goal - line technologies
could have important implications for @entity15 in @entity16 in 2022
