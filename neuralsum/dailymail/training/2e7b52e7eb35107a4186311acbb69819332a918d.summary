by @entity0 @entity1 has a very tough decision to make			1
on march 27 , as tens of thousands of the country 's university hopefuls similarly waited patiently at their computers for news - if any - that their applications were successful , the 17 - year - old from @entity9 , who had already been accepted early into @entity11 , got into @entity12			1
and then @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , too			1
' i was like - this ca n't be happening ! ' @entity1 told @entity19			1
they accepted @entity1 by 5pm , he had six @entity27 colleges offering him a place at their institutions , and then the toughest of them all , @entity29 , sent the @entity24 student an email			1
the university has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent - meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in - and they wanted @entity1			2
@entity14 , similiarly , accepted only 14 per cent			2
so what makes @entity1 so desirable as a freshman ? with an @entity46 score of 2,250 out of 2,400 - which places him in the 99th percentile for all students taking the exam - as a competitive shot putter he is also a star athlete			1

he 's very humble. , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' he 's been trained to be a high achiever right from when he was a kid			0
' we have been encouraging him to be an all - around student			0
so far , he has proved himself			0
' @entity1 matriculated at @entity24 , a large school on @entity9 , @entity26			1
his principal said that , from the start , it was clear he would succeed according to @entity69 , @entity1 's feat is extremely rare , with few students even able to apply to all eight @entity71 , because each seeks different qualities in their students			2
' my heart skipped a beat when he told me he was applying to all eight ' says @entity78 , the guidance counselor at @entity79			0
in 29 years as a counselor , she says , she 's never seen anything like this			0
' it 's a big deal when we have students apply to one or two @entity71			0
to get into one or two is huge			0
' @entity1 's success is the third big college announcement highlighting black male excellence in recent weeks			0
another success story : @entity91 , 17 , a senior at @entity93 's prestigious @entity92 , applied to five @entity27 schools and was accepted to all of them			1
