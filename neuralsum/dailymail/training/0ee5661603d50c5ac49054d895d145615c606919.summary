with @entity1 and @entity2 on the horizon , we ’ll have a clearer idea about @entity6 ’s top - four credentials by the time those @entity8 decorations are stored away for another year			1
those daunting clashes , however , hold no fear for @entity6 boss @entity11			1
‘ we challenge @entity1 and @entity2 on the back of what we ’ve done up until now , ’ said @entity11			1
@entity6 manager @entity11 is in a jovial mood for @entity8 after his team 's fantastic form 92 : the number of days since @entity18 last won a game — the 5 - 3 victory against @entity21 in september			1
12 : the number of games @entity18 have gone without a victory ( two draws and 10 losses ) .2 the number of @entity28 teams who have escaped relegation after being bottom of the table at @entity8 ( @entity33 in 2004 - 05 and @entity34 2013 - 14 )			1
-14 : - @entity18 ’s goal difference is the joint worst in the league with @entity37			2
17th : @entity18 ’s position in the table at @entity8 in their last season in the @entity28 ( 2003 - 04 )			1
19.2 : the number of shots , on average , @entity18 concede per away game — the most in the league			2
13.3 : the number of fouls , on average , @entity18 commit per game — the joint - highest in the league with @entity49			2
‘ it eases the pressure on us , the fact we can go there and see if we can go and challenge ourselves against two of the big boys in this league and see if we can get any points off them			0
‘ we ’ve earned the right to go to try to see if we can do that			0
as difficult as it might be , i think the lads are confident enough to think they may have the capabilities of doing it			0
‘ if we do n’t , it ’s not going to be too much of a knock back for us , because we know we can catch up by beating teams who are below us , like @entity18 and teams like that , which we ’ve done particularly well this year			2
‘ it ’s a nice time , i think , for us to be playing @entity1 and @entity2			1
’ saturday ’s comfortable win over @entity18 — courtesy of goals from @entity76 and @entity77 — consolidated @entity6 ’s place in the top four going into the @entity80 visit to @entity81			1

@entity11 looked certain to be sacked in the summer but owners @entity101 and @entity104 ’s decision to stick with their manager has been vindicated			0
how the @entity6 cope with the loss of @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , who are expected to be called up for @entity111 duty next month , could have a bearing on the club ’s @entity114 ambitions			0
but for the moment , @entity11 is enjoying life in the upper echelons of the @entity28			2
‘ there was a time last season when the players felt that no matter what they did , we would get battered by people , ’ said the former @entity120 chief			0
‘ everyone is going to have a bad spell ; that is the @entity28 — it happens to everyone			0
