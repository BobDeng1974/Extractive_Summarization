by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:20 pm on 20th january 2012 police in the @entity3 have charged a man with murder of a 26 - year - old woman whose drowning in 2003 was initially ruled an accident			1
@entity9 , 52 , appeared in court via a video link from the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , on 39 criminal counts , including rape , child sexual exploitation , and the premeditated murder of @entity19			1
court documents indicate that @entity9 and ms @entity19 were living with a group of people in central @entity14 that has now been linked to several deaths			2
@entity9 , 52 , appeared in court via video link yesterday having been charged with the murder in 2003 of 26 - year - old @entity19			1
investigators initially believed the 26 - year - old mother accidentally drowned while trying to rescue her 2 - year - old daughter from a swimming pool at a home in @entity32 , a city just north of @entity13 , where the group was living at the time			0
but last september ms @entity19 ' death was reclassified as murder amid evidence that the group was living off life insurance policies			2
the group of people lived together in at least three different states , either in one large home or in houses in close proximity , and was living in @entity32 at the time of @entity19 ' death , according to @entity46 , the lawyer for ms @entity19 ' parents , who were recently granted legal guardianship of their now 11 - year - old granddaughter			0
two criminal complaints unsealed on thursday show that @entity9 is facing numerous charges , including one count of sexual exploitation of an 8 - year - old child and 11 counts each of rape and sodomy			1
he also is charged with making a criminal threat as well as several counts each of aggravated assault involving a rifle and making false statements to obtain credit from a @entity13 car dealership			1
he also is accused of making false statements on life insurance applications in 2006			2
the girl 's maternal grandparents won custody in 2010 , after federal and state investigators alerted them that the child could be in ' imminent danger '			1
' there is a pattern that members of a group associated with the person using the name of @entity79 have followed of insuring members of the group and then living off the proceeds of the life insurance policies when one of them dies , ' mr @entity46 wrote in a july 2010 filing seeking custody for the grandparents			0
the judge found that the girl was in ' imminent danger ' and granted the maternal grandparents guardianship			0
filings in that guardianship case in @entity14 indicate detectives told the grandparents in 2010 that the man they knew as @entity79 was in fact @entity9 , who had been convicted of sex crimes with a child in the 1990s but had fled before sentencing			2
investigators also told the grandparents about the federal case filed against @entity9 in @entity14 for aggravated identity theft			0
in that case , he was listed at the same address in @entity107 , more than 800 miles from @entity14 , where their granddaughter was living at the time			0
@entity12 district judge @entity111 yesterday set bond at us $ 2 million pending a preliminary hearing on 2 february			1
the charges were initially filed in september but they were kept under seal while @entity9 finished serving a federal sentence for identity theft in @entity118 before being extradited to @entity14 to face the state charges			0
