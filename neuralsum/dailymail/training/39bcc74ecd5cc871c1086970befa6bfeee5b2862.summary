president @entity0 reaffirmed on wednesday the @entity2 ' position that @entity3 is ' part of the @entity5			1
' ' we are not in favor of independence , ' @entity0 said during a joint press conference in @entity10 with @entity5 president @entity11			1
' but we did encourage @entity5 authorities to take steps to preserve the unique cultural , religious and linguistic identity of the @entity18 people , ' the @entity2 leader said			1
@entity0 paid a state visit to @entity5 after attending the 22nd @entity30 ( @entity30 ) economic leaders ' meeting @entity0 has been unwavering in his stance that @entity3 should remain under the control of @entity5 , sharing the same viewpoint with exiled @entity18 leader his holiness the @entity36 when he visited the @entity37 earlier this year			1
after the february meeting the @entity37 said in a statement similar to the one offered by @entity0 today that the president expressed ' strong support ' for traditions and ' the protection of human rights for @entity18			1
' ' the president stressed that he encourages direct dialogue to resolve long - standing differences and that a dialogue that produces results would be positive for @entity5 and @entity18 , ' the @entity37 said , and explained that the @entity2 does not back independence for the region			1
in response , the @entity37 said the @entity36 ' stated that he is not seeking independence for @entity3 and hopes that dialogue between his representatives and the @entity5 government will resume			1
' careful not to anger the @entity5 , who said at the time that the meeting was ' a gross interference in @entity5 's internal affairs ' and ' a serious violation of the norms of international relation , ' the @entity37 kept the president 's hour - long one on one with spiritual leader of @entity3 mostly quiet , keeping both his entrance and exit from the president 's home out of sight from photographers			1
in today 's overseas press conference @entity0 advocated on behalf of @entity3 without formally taking its side in its dispute with @entity5 , citing ' @entity2 ’s unwavering support for fundamental human rights of all people			1
' @entity0 said he and president @entity11 ' had a very healthy exchange around these issues , ' and he told the @entity5 head that ' it is so important for us to speak out for the freedoms that we believe are universal , rights that we believe are the birthright of all men and women , wherever they live , whether it is in @entity91 or @entity92 or @entity93			1
' continuing , @entity0 said , ' we think history shows that nations that uphold these rights - including for ethnic and religious minorities - are ultimately more prosperous , more successful , and more able to achieve the dreams of their people			2
' president @entity0 is pictured here meeting with @entity36 in the @entity102 of the @entity37 on feb. 18 , 2010			1
the president traditionally meets with important world leaders in the @entity105 , but when the exiled @entity18 leader comes , he alway speaks with him in the less prestigious setting the @entity36 , left , was n't event allowed to exit the @entity37 through the front door when he visited @entity0 in 2010			1
he was forced to walk out the doors of the @entity111 , passing by trash bags waiting to be picked up due to delays from a snow storm in a statement following @entity0 's remarks president @entity11 said he had a ' candid discussion ' with his @entity2 counterpart on the topic of human rights			1
he then pointed out that ' over the last three decades and more of @entity5 's reform and opening era , @entity5 has made enormous progress in its human rights			2
world leaders have struggled for years to find appropriate ways to maintain positive relations with the @entity36 while remaining loyal to @entity5 , which often punishes countries whose heads show favoritism to the exiled cultural and spiritual icon			2
@entity5 suspended high - level diplomatic ties with @entity135 in 2012 for the next year in response to @entity135 prime minister @entity137 and deputy pm @entity139 's decision to meet with the @entity36 in @entity140			2
afterward , @entity137 refused to apologize for the face to face discussion , but he did promise not to visit with his holiness again any time soon			0
@entity5 also broke off diplomatic communications with @entity145 after it awarded a @entity5 dissident the @entity147 in 2010			0
seeking to avoid a new confrontation with @entity5 , @entity145 officials refused to see the @entity36 earlier this year when he came to the country to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his own @entity152			2
after @entity154 chancellor @entity153 entertained the exiled @entity18 leader in 2007 , @entity5 bowed out of forthcoming meeting in the country on the protection of intellectual property rights ' for technical reasons			1
' likewise , @entity5 called off a summit with the @entity162 in 2008 after then - @entity164 president and @entity162 head @entity165 agreed to meet the @entity36 and other @entity152 winners while in @entity167			2
president @entity0 has met with the @entity36 three times since taking office			2
and while the @entity5 government has responded with outrage every time , the @entity2 has not been shunned the way @entity174 countries have fit its actions			0
' internationally , if @entity10 does not show anger or protest in the strongest terms , the fear is that many heads of states will meet the @entity36 , ' @entity176 , a professor of political science professor at the @entity178 , told @entity184 after @entity0 's first meeting with his holiness			1
' so @entity5 leaders want to show as much disincentives as possible , even though they know they can not stop such meetings			0
' ' that is a fact recognized by all the people in the world , ' he added , according to a @entity37 transcript of the press conference			0
that said , ' we should never consider our work to be mission accomplished , ' @entity11 told reporters			1
' it 's always work in progress , and there is always room for further improvement			0
' @entity5 stands ready to have dialogue with the @entity2 on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect so that we can constructively handle our differences , deepen our mutual understanding , and learn from each other			1
' the @entity2 has always walked a tightrope in regards to its relations with both @entity5 , a fellow world power that holds a significant amount of @entity2 debt , and @entity3 , whom it recognizes has been mistreated at the hands of the @entity5			2
since a 1959 uprising in @entity3 , the country 's leader has lived in exile in @entity226			0
@entity5 has subsequently painted him as a subversive whom the international community can not trust			0
the @entity36 professes non-violence in the battle for autonomy in his native region , but the @entity5 say he is a ' wolf in sheep 's clothing ' and privately supports a violent takeover			0
' the @entity237 is definitely not a pure religious figure			0
he is using the cloak of religion to engage in long - term activities to separate @entity5			0
he is a political exile , ' @entity243 spokeswoman @entity242 said in a statement preceding the february 2014 meeting			0
meanwhile , human rights groups have accused @entity5 of using perverted methods themselves to keep @entity3 's residents in line			1
the @entity252 even issued a report in 2012 acknowledging the abuses and noted that ' the government ’s respect for and protection of human rights ... deteriorated markedly ' in the preceding year			0
' under the banner of maintaining social stability , the government engaged in the severe repression of @entity3 ’s unique religious , cultural , and linguistic heritage by , among other means , strictly curtailing the civil rights of @entity5 ’s ethnic @entity18 population , including the freedoms of speech , religion , association , and movement , ' reads the @entity252 's report			1
' other serious human rights abuses included extrajudicial killings , torture , arbitrary arrests , extrajudicial detentions , and house arrests , ' it said			0
according to @entity281 , more than 120 @entity18 - mostly monks and nuns - have protested @entity5 's brutal rule of the territory by lighting themselves of fire			0
smile for the cameras : president @entity11 and @entity0 participate in a welcoming ceremony at the @entity25 upon @entity0 's arrival the @entity2 and @entity5 have long been on shaky terms and @entity0 has tried to bolster the relationship by staying neutral in the country 's dispute with @entity3 while acknowledging that parent country has oppressed and abused @entity3 's people during the @entity36 's visit to @entity297 nine months ago , then - @entity37 press secretary @entity295 told reporters the @entity0 administration was ' concerned about continuing tensions and that the deteriorating human rights situation in @entity18 areas of @entity5			1
' as such , the @entity0 spokesman said , ' we will continue to urge the @entity5 government to resume dialogue with the @entity36 or his representatives without pre-conditions as a means to reduce tensions			2
' the visit marked the third time the president had invited the ' internationally respected religious and cultural leader ' to the @entity37 since taking office			2
previously the @entity36 and @entity0 met in february of 2010 and july of 2011			0
after the 2010 meeting , the @entity36 was photographed leaving @entity318 unceremoniously through a side door , where piles of not yet disposed trash were heaped in the snow			0
this year photographers never said the @entity147 laureate coming or going			0
however , the @entity37 said the meeting was held in the @entity102 - not the prestigious @entity105 where the president usually holds important meetings and entertains world leaders			0
no @entity2 president has ever sat down with the @entity36 in the @entity105 , the @entity37 has said			2
the snubs are ostensibly meant to cool tensions with the @entity5 over the assignations , though the @entity37 refused in february to go on the record with an explanation			0
' we do n't have photographers in every meeting the president has , ' @entity295 told inquiring reporters .			0

@entity0 said he encouraged @entity5 authorities ' to take steps to preserve the unique cultural , religious and linguistic identity of the @entity18 people '
he shared the same viewpoint with exiled @entity18 leader his holiness the @entity36 when he visited the @entity37 earlier this year
the @entity36 told @entity0 during their meeting that he does n't want independence for @entity3 - he wants autonomy
@entity0 also said today that he and @entity5 president @entity11 ' had a very healthy exchange ' about human rights issues
' @entity5 stands ready to have dialogue with the @entity2 on human rights issues , ' @entity11 told reporters
