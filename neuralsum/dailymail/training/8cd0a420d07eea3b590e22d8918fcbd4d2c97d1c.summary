by @entity0 published : 04:52 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 28 november 2012 more than 100,000 children aged between six and 11 have visited pro-anorexia websites that encourage people to compete against eachother in deadly starvation games , a study has found			1
there are at least 500 of these ' gruesome ' sites , which encourage vulnerable young women to barely eat and just drink coffee , smoke and take diet pills to look like a ' goddess '			1
using the phrase ' starving for perfection ' they say users should eat no more than 500 calories a day - the recommended level is 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men			1
scandal : hundreds of sites like this one exist - the post can not be shown and is one of many showing how people can use techniques to become dangerously thin message : negative imagery painted with words like these are looked at by 500,000 people per year , a study has found they also include ' thinspiration ' sections with images of super-slim women , including @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , and in the last year 500,000 girls have admitted visiting them , and one in five were aged between six and 11			1
@entity43 in @entity44 has carried out research into the issue and found than many of these websites are set up by people with anorexia and other eating disorders			2
' it starts with an individual who wants to share their experience and as they get a following they set themselves up as almost @entity59 - like , ' researcher dr @entity60 , senior lecturer in childhood and youth studies said			1
' when i started this research last january i came across a website set up by a girl who was disgusted with herself because she had put on a few pounds at @entity67			0
she planned to fast for three days and regain control			0
pictures : images like these ( @entity37 left and @entity39 's torso right ) are used as ' thinspiration ' for people using these pro-anorexic sites ' in under two hours , she had 36 followers saying things like " you ’re wonderful , you ’re an inspiration to me , i ’m only fasting because of you "			1
' some of the people are even posting pictures of themselves in very few clothes on thousands of blogs and on social media like @entity85			2
official figures show that one in 200 women and one in 2,000 men have anorexia – which means they starve themselves or exercise excessively to stay slim – although some experts believe the true number is much higher			0
around eight per cent of women and one per cent of men develop bulimia at some point			0
they binge on excessive amounts of food then make themselves sick or use laxatives to stop gaining weight			0
many sufferers of eating disorders hide their problem from family and friends by pretending they have already eaten to avoid meals and wearing baggy clothes to conceal their skeletal shape			0
doctors believe that anorexia or bulimia is more common in people who are perfectionists , tend to worry a lot or are often depressed			0
dangerous : the internet is awash with these very basic sites and they are designed to make people with eating disorders feel part of a group and compete against eachother although experts blame society ’s ‘ size zero ’ obsession for the recent surge in cases , it can be triggered by stressful events such as a death in the family , bullying at school or parents getting divorced			2
dr @entity60 said : ' girls are posting images of themselves and are then approached by people who want to sell them on porn sites because there is a market for " skinny porn "			1
but the girls are unaware they are being looked at for sexual gratification			0
' to a vulnerable teenager they appear lovely , pretty and attractive and give a sense of belonging			1
but they have a gruesome side too			0
' her study is called : ' virtually anorexic – where ’s the harm ? ' and was backed by the @entity157 and charity b - eat .			2

more than 500,000 - mainly teenage girls - are visiting these sites every year
one in five are aged between six and 11 , study finds
500 websites offer ' thinspiration ' and encourage people to starve themselves
expert @entity60 : ' to a vulnerable teenager sites offer sense of belonging '
