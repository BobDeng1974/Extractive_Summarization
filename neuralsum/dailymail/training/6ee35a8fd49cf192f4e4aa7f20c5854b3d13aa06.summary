@entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , said only $ 30,000 of the $ 103,000 taken in by the 26.4.26 @entity13 was used for the organization 's purpose			1

but @entity66 , another co-founder of that company , said it ended its relationship with @entity17 almost a year ago and his whereabouts are unknown			2
the idea behind the 26.4.26 @entity13 was for runners to participate in marathons , raising money for each of the 26 miles they ran and dedicating each mile to one of the 26 victims of the school shooting â € ” 20 children and six educators			1
the fundraising effort was featured in @entity82 and was the subject of several local news stories			0
