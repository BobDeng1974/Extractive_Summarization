of all the terrible things a single mother has endured since discovering a malignant tumour in her breast , one of the worst was how to explain to her young daughter that she had cancer			1
following her diagnosis in may 2014 , 42 - year - old @entity8 worker @entity7 worried most about how six - year - old @entity10 would take the news			1
her greatest fear was that @entity10 would be left without a mother at a young age , just like her own mother had been			1
@entity7 's grandmother had died of liver cancer when @entity7 's mother was only 10			1
@entity19 is proud of how daughter @entity10 , six , has dealt with her breast cancer diagnosis @entity7 , who is originally from @entity22 and now lives in @entity23 , said : ' when i was first diagnosed , i had all the shock , horror and anxiety to deal with and i worried history would repeat itself			1
' my grandmother died of liver cancer when she was 33 and my mother was 10			1
i was told she was in horrific pain and that has always informed my image of cancer			2
' after finding a lump in her breast , @entity7 waited until she had confirmation that it was cancer following a number of tests before broaching the subject with her daughter one bedtime			1
' i thought it would be the worst thing ever to tell @entity10 and i was worried i would dissolve into tears , ' she told @entity47			1
' but i forgot that children do n't have the same images of people being bald and throwing up			0
' beforehand i was very stressed and tearful at the thought of having to tell @entity10 but when it happened she was calm			1
' she 'd never heard of cancer before so her first response was to be puzzled			2
i did n't get the reaction i 'd had from other people that something terrible was happening to me so in the end it was one of the few occasions i did n't cry when telling someone i had cancer			2
' mother and daughter pictured after one of @entity19 's chemo sessions when she started to lose her hair @entity7 tried to make her hairloss fun for her daughter so it was less traumatic for them both since her diagnosis , @entity19 and @entity71 have found ' @entity73 ' a useful resource to help them through the incredibly difficult time			1
created by the @entity77 using money raised through @entity79 , the resource pack provides invaluable guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about what cancer is and the treatments and side - effects involved			1
designed by psychotherapists and artists , it includes puppets , photos and illustrations which help families share their emotions and gain a greater understanding of what lies ahead			0
as @entity7 explains , children often need reassurance about issues that adults would n't usually consider - like whether cancer is contagious - and are most alarmed by the hair loss caused by chemotherapy			1
' when we initially talked about it , @entity10 was most concerned about hair loss , i still remember her eyes looking big and shocked when i told her my hair would fall out , ' @entity7 said			1
' she was also worried about catching cancer and i found her looking for lumps			1
' when @entity7 did start to lose her hair , she found a way to make it less traumatic for @entity10			1
she said : ' they say it 's good to take control before it starts so i looked online for nice head scarves and in a funny way i was looking forward to wearing them			0
' it meant that when it happened it was a big event but not too traumatic for me			0
but @entity10 found my hair loss very tough to deal with , very disconcerting			1
@entity7 wearing a scarf , left , and wig , right , her daughter helped her choose following her chemo ' i 'd decided i was going to shave my hair off so we had a little party and my daughter cut my hair			1
i invited a few friends and we had drinks and biscuits			0
@entity10 took the scissors and then everyone else got involved			1
' thanks to eight gruelling chemotherapy cycles , two operations , and forthcoming radio therapy , @entity19 is getting better and hopes to make a full recovery			0
she said : ' now from what they can see it looks like the primary cancer is gone and i should be cancer free			2
but it 's hard to say i 'm cured because some of the cancer cells may have survived and escaped into the rest of my body so i 'll have annual check - ups and hope for the best			2
' @entity7 said it 's been a difficult time for both her and @entity10 but she has felt proud of the way her daughter has adapted and coped			1
she said : ' i 'm amazed at how calm @entity10 has been all the way through			1
when i had my first cycle we were all very scared and she papered my bedroom with get well cards			0
' she has always tried to cheer me up and encouraged me to look nice			0
she pressed me to get a wig , to put on a nice dress and make - up so i would feel better			2
' she reads to me and when i 've been really sick and tired she sits next to me and draws very quietly instead of jumping across the furniture like she normally would			0
' like most mothers , the thought of dying and leaving my daughter is really hard to deal with			2
but one thing i 've learned through all this is that she is extremely adaptable and would be okay			0
' the @entity167 toolkit , pictured , gives parents with cancer information on how to support their children for any other parents who find themselves in the same terrible situation , @entity19 has the following advice : ' i think it 's really important to let children get involved and have an active role as much as they can			0
' all of the things @entity10 has done have made her feel part of things			2
just like adults , if children feel included and are able do something to help it gives them an important feeling of having some control over their situation			0
' she added : ' i think being honest is also really important			0
children already know when something is up , they sense the emotional temperature and see the hugs and furtive conversations so you ca n't lie to them , especially if they are older child as they might get upset when they find out			0
you do n't want to fall apart in front of them but do n't totally hide what you 're feeling either , let them be part of your journey			0
' she also recommends the @entity206 resource pack which is available via @entity207			0
@entity7 said : ' it was really brilliant			2
from a kid 's perspective it 's like a treasure box and it was nice to have something @entity10 could open and explore			2
' it was a massive help to learn about things and i think it 's really important to be honest with children because healthy communications help families get through cancer more easily			0
@entity10 kept her mother 's spirits up with get well cards like this one she created @entity10 wrote her experiences down in a book to hep her deal with them , like when she helped @entity19 chose a wig @entity10 's story , which she wants to sell to raise money , shows how they coped when @entity19 's hair fell out ' it was a great way to kick off the conversation			1
i gave this box to my child and she opened it			0
there were things for her to play with and it really helped to explain to her about the good and bad cells			0
' it turned into a game and the whole thing was very relaxed , which is the beauty of it because it does n't feel like a big deal			0
it 's also been really useful to have something to refer back to when we 've been talking about things later on			0
' one of the ideas suggested in the information pack was for @entity10 to write down her feelings			2
so she has created a storybook about her experiences called ' how it is with @entity256 '			0
the selfless six - year - old wants to get the book published so she can support other children going through what she has experienced and give any money made from sales to charity			1
watch @entity264 â€“ face the funny on friday night from 7pm , @entity266 , to see how @entity79 cash is transforming lives in the @entity269 and across @entity270			0
