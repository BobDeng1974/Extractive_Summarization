by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 13:12 est , 1 february 2013 they were among the most feared killing machines of @entity3 , causing the deaths of thousands of servicemen at sea			1
so when the people of @entity9 woke one morning to see this @entity11 u-boat on their beach , it caused something of a shock			1
these eerie pictures show how the horrors of war got a little bit too close to home for the people of the @entity22 town			2
frightening : in 1919 , this @entity11 u-boat caused something of a commotion among the people of @entity9 after it beached in the @entity22 town washed - up : the u-boat , number 118 , had been surrendered on february 23 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched damage : the type two boat was due to be transferred to @entity30 but the tow parted and she went aground off @entity9 on april 15 the u-boat , number 118 , was surrendered on february 23 , 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched			1
the type two boat was due to be transferred to @entity30 but the tow parted and she went aground off the @entity22 coast two months later - this was despite the attempts of a @entity30 destroyer to break her up with gunfire			1
thousands of people flocked to the seafront near the @entity47 to catch a glimpse of the killing machine			1
eventually , it became so popular that the town clerk started charging people a small fee to be allowed on board			2
interest : thousands of people flocked to the seafront to catch a glimpse of the boat killing machine : the type two boat was built in the @entity63 shipyard in @entity64 and was launched on february 23 1918 captured : under the command of @entity66 , u- 118 managed to sink two ships while on its one and only patrol before being surrendered on february 23 1919 the u-boat campaign of @entity3 took place largely in the seas surrounding the @entity73 and @entity74			1
u-boats were used mainly by @entity11 commanders to block the trade routes of the @entity73 forces			2
the @entity79 needed imports for domestic food production while the @entity82 relied on imports to feed the population			0
both also need materiel to supply their war industry , sparking huge battles to block each others trade routes			0
the @entity11 used the u-boat as a way of fighting back against the @entity92 , which was far superior in size and could operate almost anywhere , unlike the @entity96 surface fleet			2
during @entity3 , u-boats were responsible for sinking about 5,000 ships and killing about 5,000 men in combat			0
the proceeds went towards the mayor 's fund for the welcome home of the troops which was planned later that year			0
but residents soon grew sick of children pelting the boat with rocks and making a racket throughout the night and the order was eventually given to break her up			0
parts of @entity67 were then snatched and dispersed all over @entity9			0
the town itself was presented with the submarine 's gun but it was buried in the shingle by wave action			0
although recovered again in 1921 it was disposed of despite calls for it to be mounted on a plinth and kept as a permanent reminder of the event			0
the boat was built in the @entity63 shipyard in @entity64 and was launched on february 23 1918			1
under the command of @entity66 , u- 118 managed to sink two ships while on its one and only patrol before it was surrendered on february 23 , 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched			1
frustrating : as residents grew sick of children pelting the boat with rocks and making a racket throughout the night , the order was given to break her up ripped apart : after the order was given to break her up , parts of @entity67 were snatched and dispersed all over @entity9 gift : the town was presented with the submarine 's gun but it was later buried in the shingle			0

the u-boat was surrendered by @entity11 forces in february 23 , 1919
it was being transferred to @entity30 but she went aground off @entity22
thousands of people flocked to the seafront to catch a glimpse of *vessel*
