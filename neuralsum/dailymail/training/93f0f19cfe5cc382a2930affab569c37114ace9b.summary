by @entity0 back in 2009 , the world economy was in a state of deep stagnation , but in the @entity9 state of @entity10 a small army of 2,000 construction men armed with spades and drills could n’t have been busier			0
working in secrecy , they were installing a 827 - mile - long underground fibre - optic cable between @entity14 and @entity15			0
there were already cables linking the two cities , but this one was different			0
the 1½in - wide plastic tube containing 400 hair - thin strands of glass had to travel in a straight line , even if that meant passing it through mountains and under car parks and rivers			0
traders use super-fast broadband connections to gain a competitive advantage on their rivals ( stock image ) the slightest kink in the route would incur the wrath of the project ’s boss , who would exasperatedly tell engineers that even deviating by the width of a road would cost him 100 nanoseconds — or a millionth of a second — in the time it took for data to travel from one city to the other			1
installing the cable was to cost £ 180 million , but the investors behind it were convinced it was going to make them very , very rich			1
for they had calculated that using this cable rather than the existing , less direct , ones would cut the time it took to send a message between the two cities from 17 milliseconds to 13			1
that ’s a fraction of the time it takes to blink very quickly , yet the minuscule time difference is enough to allow sophisticated computer programmes to exploit profitably tiny price differences between the @entity14 and @entity15 stock exchanges			1
these split seconds saved in the transmission of information , an industry expert calculated , were worth an astonishing £ 12 billion a year to those who knew how to exploit them			1
the new superfast cable would be used by around 200 trading companies , and its owners were asking each potential client to pay more than £ 8 million for the privilege			1
welcome to the extremely lucrative world of ‘ high - frequency trading ’ ( @entity78 )			1
this involves the electronic buying and selling of shares at speeds thousands of times faster than any human can manage			0
incredibly , these high - frequency deals now make up half of the trades on @entity9 ’s public stock markets			1
the high - speed computers and internet connections shave milliseconds off the time it take to trade which can lead to major profits yet according to an incendiary new book , @entity97 : cracking @entity100 , by leading financial journalist @entity99 , high - frequency traders are using the superspeed technology not to improve efficiency but to skim off ‘ incalculable billions ’ from pension and investment funds , damaging national economies in the process			1
in effect , he says , the technology enables these traders to manipulate the markets in their own favour			2
the way they do this is fiendishly simple			0
cables such as the @entity15 - @entity14 one are coupled to superfast computers which allow the high - frequency traders to see the orders placed by everyone else on the stock exchange — from ordinary investors like you and me to the biggest pension funds — milliseconds before the deals close			1
those milliseconds are all the high - frequency traders need to jump in ahead of the original purchasers , snap up whatever those ordinary investors were trying to buy , thereby pushing up the price a little , and then selling it to the buyer for a profit			1
while this may not be technically illegal , according to @entity99 , it is certainly unethical			0
the world of @entity78 while not illegal is viewed by some as unethical his depiction of these traders as a new breed of financial parasite has inflamed passions on @entity144 and in the @entity145			2
some bankers and traders have accused @entity99 of over-stating the evils of @entity78			2
but others agree with him , arguing that high - frequency traders are able to buy too many unfair advantages over ordinary investors , not just with those super-fast cables but also by paying stock exchanges for market information on planned share purchases a fraction of a second before they happen			1
last week , one of @entity144 ’s most senior brokers , @entity161 , called @entity78 a ‘ growing cancer ’ that should be made illegal			2
traders have created a ‘ technological arms race designed to pick the pockets of legitimate market participants ’ , he said			2
now , the @entity167 has just announced it will investigate whether high - frequency traders are guilty of insider trading			1
@entity9 author @entity99 is a former @entity171 broker whose previous books , @entity173 and @entity174 , have also exposed the banking world ’s misdeeds			0
@entity97 reveals that today ’s high - frequency trading rooms are deathly quiet			1
nobody screams ‘ @entity181 ! ’ or frantically waves slips of paper , because it is computers that do the actual trading as opposed to people			2
since the advent of high - speed computers , the sound of traders on the floor shouting ' sell ' is a thing of the past in places like the @entity194 ( pictured ) and these super-powered mainframe computers use sophisticated software allowing them to sift through acres of financial data looking for price discrepancies and split - second trading opportunities which they can then automatically exploit			1
the price movements might be tiny but , with millions of trades each day , it adds up into a multi-billion pound business			2
the traders — many of them maths and physics graduates — spend their days sitting in front of a bank of computer screens , staring at endless figures scrolling in front of them to make sure the machines do n’t slip up			2
whatever the morality , @entity78 is now a major force in markets across the world : high - frequency traders are even battling for an edge on the trading communication links between @entity171 and @entity15			1
a new super-speed fibre - optic cable is being laid across the @entity223 , taking a more direct route than existing cables			0
again , the time saving — just 5.2 milliseconds — is minuscule but , for those who trade in both the @entity9 and @entity228 , potentially worth millions			2
so how , exactly , does @entity78 work ? say you want to buy 50,000 shares in @entity232			0
you place your order — either electronically or over the phone — to a broker or bank , which then tries to find the best price by getting its computer to search the various stock exchanges			0
but the computer request from the broker or bank takes a small amount of time to reach those exchanges electronically			2
in that small time delay , the @entity244 pounce , buying the 50,000 @entity232 shares , which pushes up the market price very slightly , and then selling them to you for a profit at the higher price			2
in 2006 , one man set out to find out exactly what the high - frequency traders were up to			1
@entity254 , the hero of @entity99 ’s book , was a mild - mannered banker who worked for the @entity256 in @entity15 , who simply could n’t understand what was happening on his computer screen			0
he would find thousands of shares available for sale at a certain price			0
but when he pushed the ‘ buy ’ button , he might be able to buy a small percentage of them at the right price — only for the rest to have become suddenly more expensive			0
when other traders told him the same thing was happening to them , @entity254 began to suspect they were being manipulated			0
but how exactly ? the solution , he eventually discovered , was laughably simple			0
the closer a broker was to a stock market ’s computer base , the quicker it would receive his message			2
the @entity167 ( pictured ) has launched an investigation as to whether high frequency traders have been guilty of insider trading and so , when he put in an order for shares that had to be met by several exchanges — there are 13 different exchanges in the @entity9 — only the closest one to him in geographical terms would sell the shares at the original price			1
at the same time , the computers of high - frequency traders would be able to see his intention to buy shares in that particular commodity , and — exploiting their split - second advantage — would buy up those shares at the exchanges that were further away , then offer them back to the original buyer at a higher price			1
thus the buyer — whether a private investor or a giant pension fund — would end up paying more			0
high - frequency trading can happen anywhere , but it works best when there is a fragmented market — in other words , not one but lots of exchanges , preferably some distance away from each @entity311 , for example , the @entity302 is in the @entity313 , but there are six others			1
@entity316 , a @entity9 company , built one some miles away in the @entity318 area of the @entity319			0
another , @entity321 , has been built west of @entity171 in @entity322			0
the @entity194 also has a @entity228 branch in @entity324 , @entity325			0
each new exchange has been linked to the others by — guess what ? — new high - speed cable links.if you were of a suspicious turn of mind , says @entity99 , you might notice that these new exchanges are always located a ‘ surprising ’ distance from the original one			0
his implication is clear : exchanges are being set up at least partly with an eye on how they can be exploited by high - frequency traders , who will pay for the privilege of having access to the fastest electronic links			1
last july , the @entity228 ’s @entity343 fined a corrupt @entity9 - based @entity78 operator , @entity345 , $ 903,000 ( nearly £ 600,000 ) for deliberately manipulating prices on trades spanning the @entity9 and the @entity228 — its first action against a high - frequency trader			1
this week the @entity350 vowed to launch the toughest - yet clampdown on these so - called ‘ flash boys ’ , bring in new rules to force traders to have their precious algorithms — the programmes running automated trading — tested and regulated			2
critics say there are many more corrupt traders out there , but high - frequency trading is so murky it ’s difficult to know who ’s doing what			1
now , @entity99 ’s explosive new book is putting pressure on authorities to investigate @entity78 further			0
‘ he ’s managed to make everyone in this business incredibly defensive and look incredibly bad , ’ a former high - frequency trader told me yesterday			1
if this row has exposed one glaring weakness about @entity78 , it ’s that it is so complicated that virtually nobody can explain exactly how it works			0
that ’s precisely what was said about the sub-prime mortgage fiasco which led to the last global financial crisis			0
to avoid another melt - down , would traders do well to spare a nanosecond or two to reflect on that ?			0
