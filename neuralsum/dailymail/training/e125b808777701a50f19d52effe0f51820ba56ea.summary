@entity6 fatty acids found in oily fish - which include sardines , mackerel and trout - destroy malignant cells in skin and mouth tumours while leaving healthy ones alone , experiments show			1
the finding could even lead to the development of aerosols or gels containing the molecules that zap skin and mouth cancers			1
@entity6 fatty acids found in oily fish , such as this @entity24 , can destroy malignant cells in skin and mouth tumours while leaving healthy ones alone			1
britons are currently advised to eat fish at least twice a week , including one portion of oily fish			2
a portion is 140g or six ounces experiments found the omega - 3 fatty acids stopped induced cell death in both early and late stages of the diseases			1
professor @entity38 , of @entity39 , said : ‘ we found the omega - 3 fatty acid selectively inhibited the growth of the malignant and pre malignant cells at doses which did not affect the normal cells			2
‘ surprisingly , we discovered this was partly due to an over stimulation of a key growth factor ( epidermal growth factor ) which triggered cell death			0
this is a novel mechanism of action of these fatty acids			0

the finding published online in the journal @entity58 suggests they could be used in both the treatment and prevention of certain skin and oral cancers			0
as well as oily fish , flax seeds and walnuts are also a good source for the molecules that also ward off heart disease @entity6 polyunsaturated fatty acids can not be made by humans in large quantities so we must acquire them from our diet			1
as well as oily fish , flaxseeds and walnuts are also a good source of the molecule that have been shown to ward off heart disease			2
while previous research has linked omega - 3 fatty acids with the prevention of a number of cancers , there has been very little work done on oral cancers or normal cells the researchers were studying a particular type of cancer called @entity92 ( squamous cell carcinoma ) , one of the major forms of the disease			1
squamous cells are the main part of the outermost layers of the skin , and also occur in the lining of the digestive tract , lungs and other areas of the body			0
oral squamous cell carcinomas ( @entity107 ) are the sixth most common cancer worldwide and are difficult and very expensive to treat			0
the scientists grew cultures from several different cells lines , including both malignant oral and skin @entity114 along with pre malignant cells and normal skin and oral cells , to which they added the fatty acids			2
while previous research has linked omega - 3 fatty acids with the prevention of a number of cancers , there has been very little work done on oral cancers or normal cells			1
lab member dr @entity131 said : ‘ as the doses needed to kill the cancer cells do not affect normal cells , especially with one particular fatty acid we used called @entity136 ( @entity138 acid ) , there is potential for using omega - 3 fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of skin and oral cancers			1
‘ it may be those at an increased risk of such cancers , or their recurrence , could benefit from increased omega - 3 fatty acids			1
' moreover , as the skin and oral cancers are often easily accessible , there is the potential to deliver targeted doses locally via aerosols or gels			0
however further research is needed to define the appropriate therapeutic doses			0

@entity6 fatty acids shown to destroy cells in skin and oral tumours
sources of omega - 3 fatty acids include oily fish , flax seeds and walnuts
may lead to development of aerosols that zap skin and mouth cancers
