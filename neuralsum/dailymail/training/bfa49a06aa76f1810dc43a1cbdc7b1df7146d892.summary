the @entity0 is to offer alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease transplants for the first time alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease are to be allowed to have transplants on the @entity0 for the first time			1
the scheme will be controversial because there is a national shortage of suitable organs for transplant – and critics will say those who bring ill - health on themselves should not receive such help			1
the @entity19 's decision , announced last night , will affect those with ' severe alcohol - associated hepatitis ' ( @entity23 ) , who have until now been excluded from transplants because the prognosis was so poor			1
admitting some people may be unwilling to donate if they know their livers may go to such patients , @entity27 's @entity26 told the @entity31 : ' we transplant humans , not angels			1
' the pilot project comes amid concern over rising deaths from alcoholic liver diseases – at a time when deaths from other conditions are falling			0
while alcohol consumption is on a downward trend across most of @entity45 , it has soared over the past 50 years in the @entity46			1
doctors say liver disease victims are getting younger by the year , but cases of the condition are rising most quickly among the over- 60s			0
at present , people are usually only considered for transplant if they have a more than 50 per cent chance of survival after five years , with a good quality of life			2
alcoholics are required to show they will be able to give up drink for the rest of their lives			0
however , about a fifth of liver transplants involve patients whose condition has been linked to their drinking , including the late footballer @entity68			0
last night @entity69 of the @entity70 , said instead of looking at the cause of a potential recipient 's disease , ' we should be looking at what their healthcare needs are and not be judgmental '			2
most liver disease is caused ' one way or another ' by personal choices , he said , adding : ' the vast majority of people who have transplanted organs do look after them and lead a far healthier life			2
' @entity68 , who died in november 2005 , suffered from a series of internal organ infections after undergoing a liver transplant in july 2002 there is sometimes not sufficient time to judge the prospects of @entity23 patients giving up alcohol and they often suffer infection and bleeding as well as having deep jaundice and mental confusion			1
the patients doctors intend to treat in the pilot scheme must be between 18 and 40 and must not have seen a doctor about liver disease or been diagnosed with a drink problem before			0
there has been concern among transplant specialists over the number of candidates they may have to assess – and the impact on other patients awaiting organs			1
mr @entity26 said : ' we need to retain public confidence that organs donated are used properly			0
that trust has to be earned – it can be lost very quickly			0
' the latest rethink was prompted by a study in november 2011 which reported six - month survival rates of 77 per cent among @entity23 patients who received a new liver .			0

@entity19 announced its decision last night
@entity120 brought in despite shortage of suitable organs for transplant
decision will affect those with ' severe alcohol - associated hepatitis '
