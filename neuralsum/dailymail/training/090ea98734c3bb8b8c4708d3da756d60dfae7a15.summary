by @entity0 last updated at 12:46 am on 21st january 2012 after the hard - fought , violent and costly eviction of the @entity4 illegal traveller camp , some may have thought the decade - long saga had finally reached an end			1
but as these pictures reveal , the battleground has merely moved a few yards away			0
they show that since @entity4 was cleared in october at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £ 18million , there has been an extraordinary explosion in the number of caravans pitched on the legal @entity17 site next door			1
taken over : the @entity4 site , three months after its eviction , shows that while the illegal half on the right has been cleared , the number of caravans on the legal half next door has now swollen taken over : the @entity4 site , three months after its eviction , shows that while the illegal half on the right has been cleared , the number of caravans on the legal half next door has now swollen eyesore : a picture taken on november 8 , around three weeks after the original eviction shows how relatively quiet the legal half of the site was before travellers descended on it in recent weeks many are from the 90 that were removed from @entity4 , in @entity38 , @entity39			1
most of the travellers are thought to have relatives on the @entity17 site and began to return in the run - up to @entity45			2
the overcrowding is so bad that it breaches planning permission , and @entity48 is preparing to serve eviction notices on half of the site ’s 34 pitches by the end of january			1
notices are also set to be served on travellers parked on a private road approaching the site and surrounding streets for breach of regulation			1
staying put : @entity48 revealed that many of the illegally parked caravans at @entity4 belong to families who were evicted from the other half of the site last year over capacity : of the 34 caravan pitches on the legal side of @entity4 , around 50 per cent are said to be breaching planning conditions remnants : doormats , mattresses and other discarded household items litter the road on the now empty side of @entity4 the notices would give the travellers 28 days to vacate the land			1
in an all - too - familiar echo of the battle for @entity4 , the travellers say they are determined to fight any council moves to evict them			1
one , who would give her name only as @entity87 , said : ‘ we are going nowhere			0
when they serve the notices we will ignore them			0
‘ people are ready to fight for their homes again			0
it will be like another @entity4 situation all over again			2
’ @entity87 , 23 , added : ‘ they may send in the police and the bailiffs but we will stay here			0
’ fire fight : the @entity4 site erupted into violent clashes when police and bailiffs moved to evict travellers late last year battle : police rise up on a cherry picker during the peak of the eviction fight at @entity4 last october @entity107 , who lives near the site , said : ‘ i counted about 56 mobile touring vehicles on the road leading to @entity4 and crowded on to the @entity17 site			1
‘ but a lot of the people we see nowadays are new travellers who have turned up and not those who were there before			2
’ a total of 43 people were arrested and several injured after @entity4 protesters fought running battles with riot police in october in the eviction of about 80 families from what was the @entity126 ’s largest illegal traveller settlement			1
legal fight : the @entity4 camp near @entity129 in september , as @entity48 attempted to end their ten - year battle with travellers on the illegal site a decade - long legal battle was declared a success and @entity48 announced that the six - acre site , which was built illegally on green belt land , was clear			1
council leader @entity137 said of the latest developments : ‘ it ’s a disappointment and a frustration but not completely unexpected that this has happened			0
the fact that the law is now being broken means we will move in to enforce it			0
’ but campaigner @entity146 , who lived on the @entity4 site for ten years , said : ‘ there will be another @entity4 stand - off , there is no doubt about it			2
the travellers have nowhere else to go and this is their home			2
they will fight for their homes and livelihood			0
‘ @entity137 will have to try and evict us all over again			0
and that will cost too much			0
