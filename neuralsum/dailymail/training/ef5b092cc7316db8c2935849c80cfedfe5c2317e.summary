by @entity0 a pricey pint : @entity3 experts have warned that global warming could significantly increase the price of a pint of beer from rising sea levels to extreme weather ravaging countries and destroying homes , climate change is blamed for a range of undesirable events			1
and now @entity3 experts have warned that global warming could significantly increase the price of a pint of beer - and even change the taste			1
it is thought that if the planet gets hotter there will be more frequent droughts to regions that grow grains such as barley , which is a key ingredient in beer			0
if barley is in extra demand , the price of it will rise and buying beer will be more expensive as a result , scientists told the @entity31			2
in a bid to keep the price of a pint stable , a team of researchers from the @entity34 are trying to drought - proof barley			1
they have identified ‘ stay - green ’ characteristics in types of barley that were first spotted in another grain called sorghum , which grows in hot places			1
researcher @entity46 told the newspaper that the discovery could mean a stable supply of carbohydrates for the brewing process			0
climate change could affect the amount of starch in barley , pushing the cost of a serving of beer up from around $ 5 ( £ 2.70 ) to as much as $ 20 ( £ 11 ) , mr @entity46 warned			1
‘ i 'm not saying they 're the actual values , but the amount of energy and water and things that have to go into the brewing process will increase , ’ he said			0
beer at risk : it is thought that is the planet gets hotter there will be more frequent droughts to regions that grow grains such as barley ( pictured ) which is a key ingredient in beer sorghum is a genus of grasses with about 30 species , one of which is raised for grain			2
the plants are cultivated in warm climates worldwide			0
one species , @entity84 , is native to @entity85 and is an important crop used for food , fodder alcoholic beverages and biofuels			0
most varieties are drought and heat - tolerant and are especially important in arid regions , where the grain is a staple food			2
sorghum bicolor is an important food crop in @entity85 , @entity97 and @entity98 and is the fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world			0
the study , which was published in the @entity102 , detailed how a ‘ stay - green ’ set of genes could be bred into grains to help them deal with drought and maintain their starch structure			2
he said : ‘ it is a trait that naturally occurs , more in wild types of barley like regrowth and things like that			0
so basically breeders have gone back to ancient sources of sorghum and reintroduced them , because with conventional breeding eventually you lose traits that are beneficial , and drought - proof the plant			1
’ farmers had bred away from the ‘ stay - green ’ aspects of the crop in favour of focusing purely on yields , so the scientists have re-introduced the traits			2
preserving the pint : experts explained that selective breeding will benefit brewers , who want the barley grain to have quality of the starch to maintain a consistent flavour as well as farmers who could still get a decent crop even in bad weather conditions such as drought ( illustrated ) mr @entity46 explained that the move could benefit brewers , who want the grain to have quality starch to maintain a consistent flavour , as well as farmers who would still get a decent crop even in bad weather conditions			1
while mr @entity46 could not guarantee to safeguard barley for beer , he said that ‘ with certain drought - tolerant traits , you can have a more stable supply of specific quality grain ’			1
dr @entity162 , also at the university , said sorghum breeders had long taken advantage of ‘ stay - green ’ characteristics for improved yield and a similar trait in barley could present growers with an innovative way of responding to the challenges of climate change			1
the two plants are distantly related and both evolved in warmer parts of the world			0
dr @entity162 said sorghum breeders had long taken advantage of ' stay - green ' characteristics for improved yield , and a similar trait in barley could present growers with an innovative way of responding to the challenges of climate change			1
a field of sorghum is pictured ‘ so if we can help growers produce barley that is more in - tune with what industry wants , we ’re well on the way to improving productivity and profitability , ’ he said			0
each year @entity3 produces about two million tonnes of malting barley and a good proportion of that is exported throughout @entity98 and the @entity196			0
‘ our team ’s research has shown that normal grain development and starch composition can survive significant water and heat stress in selected barley lines , ’ he added .			0

climate change could affect the amount of starch in barley
researchers from the @entity34 are trying to drought - proof barley to preserve the taste and price of a pint of beer
' stay green ' characteristics can be introduced to ensure supply of grain
means the taste of beer would *n't* be affected by *adverse* weather conditions
