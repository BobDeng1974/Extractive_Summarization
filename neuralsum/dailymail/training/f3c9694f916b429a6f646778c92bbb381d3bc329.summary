living a healthy lifestyle could cut your risk of dementia by a third , claim leading health specialists			1
analysis by @entity6 suggests there are five steps people can take to maintain brain health and reduce their risk of developing diseases such as @entity14 ’s			1
the review of academic studies and data reveals that lifestyle contributes to about three - quarters of cognitive decline , the type of changes in thinking skills which increase with age including memory loss and speed of thinking			2
the key factors were taking regular exercise , not smoking , a healthy bodyweight , eating a @entity44 diet and a low alcohol intake			1
the advice has become increasingly familiar from other research that shows staying slim , eating lots of fruit and vegetables , exercising regularly , never smoking , and drinking in moderation is the recipe for dementia - free longevity			1
the new findings come from @entity55 , an @entity6 funded research project into how thinking skills alter with age , which suggests that changing lifestyle can result in health benefits			1
the review , which included the latest international dementia studies , also found that preventing and treating diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity could reduce the risk of dementia			1
the review highlighted the importance of physical exercise – aerobic , resistance or balance - as the most effective way to ward off cognitive decline in healthy older people and reduce the risk of developing alzheimer ’s disease			2
studies suggest that exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is beneficial			0
in the @entity6 , adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it			2
it found that there are significantly more new cases of @entity14 ’s among current smokers compared with those who have never smoked			1
the review also backed up claims that very heavy drinking is also linked to dementia , resulting in the loss of brain tissue particularly in the parts of the brain responsible for memory and processing and interpreting visual information			2
a healthy weight is a ‘ healthy ’ body mass index ( @entity102 ) score			0
@entity102 is assessed by comparing height to weight , in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared			0
a healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 – above is overweight and obese			0
never smoking is recommended , but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain 10 years of extra life , claim scientists			0
the @entity44 diet is high in fish , nuts , whole grains and ‘ healthy ’ fats such as those in olive oil , while low in red meat and dairy products			0
studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories			0
doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended			0
in the @entity6 , adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it			2
low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men , two or fewer for women , with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour			0
a small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units , while a pint of beer contains at least two units			0
but moderate levels of alcohol protect brain tissue by increasing good cholesterol and lowering bad cholesterol			0
according to the latest estimates , there are 850,000 people in the @entity6 living with dementia			1
@entity158 , charity director of @entity6 said ‘ while there ’s still no cure or way to reverse dementia , this evidence shows that there are simple and effective ways to reduce our risk of developing it to begin with			1
‘ what ’s more , the changes that we need to make to keep our brains healthy are already proven to be good for the heart and overall health , so it ’s common sense for us all to try to build them into our lives			0
the sooner we start , the better our chance of having a healthy later life			0
’ dr @entity180 , head of policy at @entity182 , said ‘ this review of existing research highlights a growing body of evidence suggesting that lifestyle factors play an important role in our risk of dementia and cognitive decline			1
‘ it ’s now recognised across public health authorities that lifestyle changes could contribute to reducing dementia risk			1
it ’s now time for these messages to start reaching the public to help empower people protect their cognitive health as they grow older			0
‘ a number of studies have suggested that what ’s good for the heart is good for the brain , and we know that regular exercise , eating a healthy diet , not smoking and not drinking too much can help to reduce the risk of dementia			1
‘ evidence also suggests that controlling blood pressure and keeping weight in check may help to lower the risk of the condition			2
‘ it ’s important to remember that diseases like @entity14 ’s are complex and are likely to be caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors , which are still not fully understood ’ he added .			1

research by @entity6 found five lifestyle factors which may cut risk
eating healthily , not smoking and exercising can lower chance of dementia
men who followed steps 36 per cent less likely to develop @entity14 *'s*
