chief inspector of the @entity2 sir @entity1 said budget cuts mean a smaller police force that wo n't investigate less serious crimes police faced fury last night after the chief inspector of @entity2 warned forces may have to ignore crimes such as shoplifting			1
sir @entity1 said looming budget cuts mean they will need to focus on offences that ‘ matter most to people ’			1
but critics accused him of promoting a cavalier approach to policing and pointed out shoplifting is not a victimless crime			1
sir @entity1 , head of the police watchdog , said shrinking forces will need to ‘ work smarter ’ , focusing on crimes such as violent or drug - related offences and sexual exploitation of children			1
he told @entity26 : ‘ @entity27 is here to stay			0
we are heading for a smaller police service			1
’ asked if there will be crimes that officers should not investigate ‘ quite so hard ’ , sir @entity1 replied : ‘ any crime that is reported to the police has to be taken seriously , however there are crimes that are more serious than others			1
‘ nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people			2
’ last night , his comments provoked anger from mps and retail experts			2
they said ignoring shoplifting would blight communities , damage the economy and have a knock - on effect on gang crime , drugs and anti-social behaviour			2
@entity54 of the @entity55 , said : ‘ shoplifting is not a victimless crime			2
it affects people who work in stores – often thefts can be violent and cause a great deal of damage and cost			0
‘ if you leave shoplifting unchallenged , it starts a spiral of decline where communities end up blighted by other crime			0
’ sir @entity71 says forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘ radical action ’ is taken shoplifting is on the rise , with 321,014 thefts across @entity79 and @entity80 in the year to june , up 21,000 on the previous 12 months			1
@entity82 mp @entity81 , a criminal barrister , said : ‘ as someone who has prosecuted shoplifters as well as more serious cases of violence and sexual offences , i think there has to be an understanding of the consequences of allowing offences of dishonesty			0
‘ as well as damaging the economy , it would be wrong to dismiss shoplifting cases in a cavalier fashion because these costs are met by the general public			0
’ last month @entity100 commissioner sir @entity71 warned of a threat to public safety without radical police reforms in the face of budget cuts			1
@entity106 , chairman of the @entity107 representing rank and file officers , called last night for a debate on which crimes the public wants officers to concentrate on			0
he said : ‘ we ca n’t continue to police the way we have			0
’ chief constable @entity117 , acting president of the @entity118 , said : ‘ we have been prepared to expect further budget reductions in the coming years			0
' an unprecedented rise in reports of child abuse , cyber-crime and public protection issues means that forces need to invest more heavily in these areas			0

head of police watchdog sir @entity1 said there *'s* room for further cuts
but *acknowledged* the police would have to focus more on serious crime
said police need to ' work smarter ' as *inevitably* the service will be smaller
comments come after @entity100 commissioner sir @entity71 warned of a threat to public safety without radical reform
