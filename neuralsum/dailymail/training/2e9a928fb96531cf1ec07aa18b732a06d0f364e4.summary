‘ @entity13 told me “ if you do n’t want me to touch your sister then i ’ll do it to you			1
but my brother ’s a policeman and if you tell he ’ll take you away ” ‘ i was nine , her big sister , i wanted to keep her safe			0
but he started abusing me , touching me , he raped me too , ’ @entity9 says			2

however she started drinking again and was re-admitted and while there she fell and broke her pelvis			0
although both sisters went on to marry and have children , the psychological damage of the abuse remained			1

‘ @entity10 had told a social worker about her past			2
now the police were asking if i ’d make a statement			0
‘ nearly 40 years had passed			1
i was afraid of speaking out after having kept our secret so long			0
but at the same time i knew this was my chance to make sure that twisted paedo finally paid for what he 'd done			0
' ” he raped me too , ” i said simply			0
‘ that night i went to see @entity10 in hospital and told her			2
she was shocked as she 'd no idea he 'd done it to me too			0
@entity9 gave evidence in person at the trial ‘ we told our husbands and they were so supportive and a few weeks later the police arrested and charged him			2
' five months later case went to trial at @entity33			0
@entity10 had been bed - bound since her fall but she gave evidence via video link , but @entity9 spoke in court in front of @entity13			1

we owe it to ourselves and our families			0
and i know one day soon , now it ’s all over my little sis will be properly back up on her feet again			0
@entity10 says : ‘ i did n't speak about the abuse for years because he made me feel ashamed			1
i almost drank myself to death to blot out what he ’d done but @entity9 and my family made me see sense just in time			0
‘ i know now none of it was my fault and i want to make up for all those lost years , start living again ' me and @entity9 are living poof that justice can be done even years after			1
