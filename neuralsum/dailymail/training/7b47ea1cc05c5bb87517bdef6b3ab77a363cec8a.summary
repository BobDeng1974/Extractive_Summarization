@entity1 backpacker @entity0 may have been trying to save @entity2 as she was being attacked on a @entity4 beach when the pair were brutally murdered , new evidence suggests			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity8 was captured on @entity9 at around 1am on the night of his death , leading to claims the pair were not in fact together as @entity14 previously claimed			1
traces of miss @entity2 's dna and that of one other person were found on a cigarette butt some 50 yards from where her body was found , suggesting the 23 - year - old shared it with her attackers and even had a conversation with them before being killed			1

police refer to @entity38 as ‘ foreigners ’ but officers would not comment whether the woman might turn out to be @entity2 herself , fleeing from the killer or killers who were to soon battered her to death on @entity28 ’s idyllic @entity45			1
@entity4 police inquiries have been branded a ' joke ' by locals after investigators mistakenly identified a couple in @entity9 footage walking hand - in - hand as the murdered brits			1
@entity9 footage of the woman - who might also turn out to be a terrified witness to the double murders - has yet to be released			1
the @entity58 has been called in to assist , as officials concede they do not have sophisticated enough forensic technology			1
yesterday bar and restaurant staff were lined up on the beach and had their feet compared to footprints found near where the youngsters ' bodies were found last week			2
it comes as @entity69 of @entity14 told @entity70 today that the team were not closing in on any suspects and agreed that he did not know whether the killers were still on the island			0
asked specifically whether they could have already left , he nodded in agreement			0
the movements of @entity78 and mr @entity0 in the hours leading up to their murders added to the mystery of their deaths as it was confirmed that @entity9 footage of a couple walking hand in hand - said early to be the @entity1 - were not them after all			1
@entity4 police yesterday were measuring the feet of bar and restaurant staff after examining footprints left in sand near where the victims ' bodies were discovered workers were forced to hold up signs with their names and a number on it as officials took their feet size and dna n what has been branded a ' joke ' by local people @entity4 police have been criticised for leading a chaotic investigation into the deaths of @entity0 and @entity2 in which the line of inquiry has changed several times			1
here , a breakdown of the investigation shows how the frantic hunt for backpackers ' killers has unfolded			2
september 15 : the semi-naked bodies of @entity2 and @entity0 are discovered between 5am and 6am on @entity45 in @entity28 on september 15			1
a @entity1 male , thought to have known the two , was named as a person of interested and hunted by police after allegedly fleeing the island on an early ferry for @entity122			2

@entity150 and @entity151 were stopped at @entity152 on their way back to @entity1 for questioning			0
the brothers were never arrested			0
september 17 : @entity4 police admit they have ' no idea ' who killed @entity0 and @entity2 after failing to link any of 12 suspects to the crime			1

earlier @entity4 prime minister said it girls wearing bikinis on the holiday island of @entity28 were not safe unless they were ugly			2
' can they be safe in bikinis ... unless they are not beautiful ? ' said @entity181 in a televised speech			0
he later apologised for his remarks			0
police later say miss @entity2 may not have been raped as first suggested following an autopsy on her body			2
september 18 : police claim dna from two men alongside that of @entity78 has been discovered on a cigarette butt 50 yards from where the 23 - year - old 's body was found			1
they say traces of at least one man 's dna has been found on miss @entity2 's body			2
later it transpires there is evidence of one man 's dna on the cigarette , and of two men in the victim 's body			2
it is suggested @entity0 was killed with a blunt piece of metal and not the rusty garden hoe first discovered at the scene and named as a murder weapon			0

a @entity9 video of a woman running near the scene is described but not released			0
police say it could be of a witness to the double murder , a suspect or of @entity78 herself			2
the @entity58 is called in to help analyse forensic evidence as the hunt for the pair 's killers goes in to its sixth day			1
@entity4 police efforts are blasted a ' joke ' by residents			1
new @entity9 footage has emerged of mr @entity0 walking alone along the restaurant and club strip in the early hours of monday			1
the first clip was recorded as 1.27am , while the second , in which he is seen walking in the opposite direction – towards what would become the scene of his death – was captured at 1.56am			0

divers were among officers continuing the search for a second weapon yesterday			0
one was seen waist - deep in the water drawing up sand with a rake			0
police believe the killers used a garden hoe – which has been found – to batter @entity78 and a ‘ metal weapon ’ to bludgeon mr @entity0			1
the evidence of a second weapon has left police with what one officer today described as ‘ unquestioned proof ’ that at least two killers were involved			0
but one expatriate was critical of the @entity4 police , who have been criticised for the haphazard nature of the investigation			1
‘ all this activity leaves you with a feeling that this is too little , too late , ’ said the businessman , who declined to be named			0
‘ surely anything of any use would have been washed away or stomped on by now			0
’ @entity304 replied with mixed answers when asked specifically whether post mortem examinations on the bodies had revealed the presence of drugs			0
at first he said no , then he said he did not know and when pressed one of his aides said such questions should not be asked ‘ out of respect for the victims and the families ’			0
earlier it was claimed it was possible the @entity1 had either walked past their killers , who were lurking in the shadows between the lights of late - night waterside bars , or they were followed and attacked when they were on the beach beside boulders close to their holiday bungalows			2
as divers searched for the weapon , police finally conceded they were finding the double - murder ' quite difficult ' an autopsy showed that mr @entity0 had been struck with a metal bar , rather than the garden hoe used to strike miss @entity2 tourists take pictures at @entity45 beach spot where mr @entity0 and @entity2 were killed on monday tourists continued to arrive at the island today where local businesses are hopeful the double murder does n't ruin the islands reputation relatives of the pair arrived in @entity122 on thursday as police struggle to examine forensic evidence due to lack of technology @entity4 's prime minister today apologised for suggesting tourists in bikinis made themselves more vulnerable - comments which provoked outrage around the world			1
in an extraordinary outburst yesterday , @entity181 ( right ) suggested that only ugly tourists were safe when wearing beach wear			0
his remark appeared to blame murdered briton @entity2 for exposing herself to a brutal attack on the paradise island of @entity28			2
in a speech broadcast live on @entity357 yesterday , he said : ‘ there are always problems with tourist safety			0
‘ they think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want , they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere			0
can they be safe in bikinis ... unless they are not beautiful ? ’ he was last night accused of smearing a murdered @entity1 backpacker to protect his country ’s tourism industry			0
@entity374 , a member of the @entity376 foreign affairs committee , said : ' what is most worrying about these comments is the underlying implication about those who have been murdered that they have somehow brought it upon themselves			0
' in a hastily convened press conference in @entity122 today , @entity384 said : ' i 'm sorry that it hurt people			0
' i did n't intend to insult or criticise anyone			0
i just warned that sometimes people have to be careful ... today @entity4 is safe except there are some bad guys - like anywhere in the world			0

new evidence suggests the pair were not together at all on night of murders
@entity0 might have gone to girl 's aid when she was ' attacked by group '
@entity2 shared cigarette with someone before attack , say police
@entity9 footage shows mr @entity0 walking alone at 1am on night of death
it is thought @entity78 ' had conversation ' with attackers on beach
