@entity0 appears unlikely to play any first - class cricket this summer after @entity2 resisted the temptation to draft him into their @entity5 squad to travel to @entity6			1
there were suggestions , up until last week , that @entity0 - who has played exclusively @entity10 cricket since being axed by @entity11 last winter - might yet help his county out in their final two championship matches			2
but third - placed @entity2 , still in with only rank outsiders ' chances of promotion from @entity17 , have decided instead to look to the future by giving younger players another opportunity away to table - toppers @entity6 in a match starting on tuesday			0
specialist : @entity0 has played for @entity2 in @entity24 this season as well as travelling to play the shortest form absent : @entity11 's former batsman has not featured in the four - day game for his county at all this year @entity2 director of cricket @entity28 explained the reasoning to his club 's official website , @entity33 , saying : ' we discussed it , [ head coach ] @entity37 and myself , the possibility of bringing @entity0 in			1
' but realistically , we 've got just an outside chance of promotion			0
' so it 's better for the future of the club if we give the likes of an an @entity47 or @entity48 two first - class games to gain more experience to see how they can progress - which will stand us in good stead for next season			2
' young stars : @entity47 ( left ) and @entity48 ( right ) could be given a chance in the final two games			0

@entity57 has not played a first - class game this summer
@entity0 has played for @entity2 in @entity10 cricket this season
@entity0 is available for final two games as @entity2 push for unlikely promotion
but @entity28 says giving *youngsters* a chance is more *important*
