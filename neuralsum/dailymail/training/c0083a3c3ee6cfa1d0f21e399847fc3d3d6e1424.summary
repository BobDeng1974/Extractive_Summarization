hundreds of thousands of men could enjoy a boost to their love lives following an @entity5 decision to dish out much more viagra on prescription			1
until this month , only men who suffered impotence as a side effect of illness or those evaluated by a specialist could be given the pills on the @entity5			1
but since @entity6 ’s patent ran out last year , its cost has plummeted by 93 per cent as generic versions of the drug have become available			1
doctors have welcomed the change – which came into effect on august 1 – saying it had the potential to save relationships			1
half of all men aged between 40 and 70 are estimated to suffer from erectile dysfunction			2
however , others claim increased demand for the drug will add to @entity42 ’ already heavy workloads			2
until a year ago , branded @entity6 pills , made by @entity46 pharmaceutical giant @entity45 , cost £ 21.27 for a pack of four			0
but after the firm ’s patent expired in june 2013 , rival companies have been allowed to make ‘ generic ’ versions containing the same active ingredient , sildenafil , priced at just £ 1.45 for four pills			1
@entity55 , president of the @entity56 , said the original restrictions , introduced in 1999 , had been designed to save the @entity5 money			1
‘ they made the fairly arbitrary decision that if you had a discrete illness – like prostate cancer , diabetes or a spinal cord injury – you could get it on the @entity5 , ’ he added			1
‘ but if you were a man of a certain age and wearing out a bit , you could only get a private prescription and you had to pay full whack			0
’ the @entity70 said that it did not believe the relaxing of restrictions would lead to a rise in spending			0
in 2012 , the @entity5 in @entity74 spent £ 88 million on providing erectile dysfunction drugs to 180,000 men , of which £ 43 million went on branded @entity6			1
under the new rules , it estimates demand could nearly double in three years to 330,000 and cost the @entity5 £ 68 each time a patient is prescribed sildenafil			1
however , the reduced price in the cost of the drug means overall spending on the condition would not rise			2
dr @entity86 , chairman of charity @entity87 , said the move ‘ would make a great deal of difference to the mental wellbeing and happiness of these patients ’			0
‘ it ’s not a myth that relationships can be put in jeopardy by erectile dysfunction			0
this decision will enable some relationships to flourish when they ’re being threatened			0
’ doctors have welcomed the change - which came into effect on august 1 - saying it could save relationships visiting a doctor to ask for the drugs could also help men to identify the underlying causes of their impotence , including serious health problems , he added			1
‘ erectile dysfunction can be a sign of underlying illness like diabetes , coronary heart disease , or peripheral arterial disease			2
’ dr @entity119 , chairman of the @entity122 ’s clinical and prescribing sub-committee , said the change ‘ partially corrects an historic injustice done to men and their partners who were denied an effective treatment for a distressing condition ’			2
but dr @entity129 , chairman of clinical innovation and research at the @entity132 , said : ‘ you need to be careful			0
there can be side effects for some patients and sildenafil can react with other drugs			2
’ taking sildenafil with nitrates drugs such as the angina spray @entity142 can lead to a sudden and serious loss of blood pressure , he warned			0
doctors are also concerned about sildenafil being used as a recreational drug			0
viagra – both the branded and generic versions – has been linked to 134 deaths since 1998 , according to the @entity152 drugs regulator , @entity151			1
almost half were caused by heart problems			0
a @entity70 spokesman said : ‘ erectile dysfunction is a common and distressing condition and may be a sign of more serious underlying health problems			0
now this treatment is cheaper we have made it more widely available on the @entity5			1
we hope this will encourage more men to visit their gp			0

only men with impotence as side effect of an illness could get the drug
but generic versions of drug have caused value to plummet 93 *%*
as a result , @entity5 has ruled all men with serious impotence are *eligible*
