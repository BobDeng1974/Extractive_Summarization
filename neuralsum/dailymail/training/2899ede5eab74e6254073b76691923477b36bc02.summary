by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 21 september 2013 medical equipment worth millions of pounds that was used as recently as 2009 is gathering dust at @entity4 's last military hospital			1
the @entity5 , which was where the cure for the naval disease scurvy was discovered , closed its doors for the last time four years ago , when it was sold by the @entity9 to private firm @entity10 for a reported £ 3 million			1
now an undercover photographer has gained access to the 63 - acre site in @entity14 , @entity15 , and captured the apparently fully equipped hospital - paid for by the taxpayer - that has been left abandoned to its fate			1
waste : medical equipment worth millions of pounds and paid for by the taxpayer is gathering dust abandoned : none of the medical equipment at the @entity5 has ever been removed bizarre : much of the equipment inside the @entity26 looks in good condition and appears ready for use operation : the firm behind the project insisted most of the equipment that had value was taken fabric : the equipment that remains is said to be embedded into the ceiling and walls making it difficult to remove exactly why is a mystery			1
' urban explorer ' , known only as chaos , said : ' it was almost impossible to take these pictures			0
' i almost gave up after searching for around an hour for a way in , whilst avoiding active security patrols , who are renowned for being merciless			0
' a lot of effort from the security company had gone into making sure that this location was incredibly well sealed			0
' but even the keenest eye can overlook a tiny detail , which can be all we need to find our way inside			0
' once inside , @entity55 described a seen that was a monument to the past , with modern - looking ct scanners , operation theatres , wards and other medical equipment potentially bought for millions when they were first purchased still looking like they were ready to use			1
he said : ' behind those beautiful @entity65 walls remains the familiar sight of a fairly modern hospital albeit , now completely deserted			2
' staggering amounts of seemingly priceless medical machinery remain , such as x-ray machines , @entity72 and @entity73 scanners			1
historic : the @entity5 was built in 1746 and was at the centre of the cure for scurvy scrap : the owner of the property says everything of value was removed and what remains has no value empty : this room would have contained other equipment , that was removed by the @entity87 eerie : the beds might have been removed , but other equipment remains in the abandoned ward @entity92 : a corridor inside the hospital show very few signs of wear and tear notes : procedures and guidelines remain pinned up on the hospital 's walls deep clean : other equipment with no value even remains on site , never having been cleared away ' no doubt these have now fallen victim to rapid advances in technology and are more than likely obsolete by the standards of today			1
' i found departments of the hospital that would otherwise be inaccessible to the general public in a working hospital			2
' we can see what it ’s like in the operating theatres and the laboratories littered with chemistry equipment , biopsy scanners and centrifuges			1
' the hospital was built in 1746 during the reign of ‘ mad ’ @entity127 , and was once the last exclusively military hospital in the @entity4 that was once the largest brick - built building in the country was closed in 2009			2
reception : the fixtures and fittings of the x-ray unit remain in place technology : even computer equipment remains onsite at the former hospital in @entity14 theatre : the view shows an operating theatre at what was the last @entity4 military hospital embedded : this piece of equipment , fitted into the wall , could not be removed without causing damage @entity147 : the new owner of the hospital claims the only equipment that remains is that which could not be sold or even given away containers : this equipment was considered surplus to requirements when the @entity87 moved out the most eminent surgeon serving at the hospital was @entity157 , who sailed with the legendary @entity4 explorer @entity159			1
he correctly linked the lack of fruit and vegetables in the diet of sailors as being the root cause of scurvy			2
' i always try and imagine the place when it was operational and wonder what it would have been like to be a fly on the wall , ' said @entity55			0
' people ca n’t quite believe that i had free roam of a fairly modern hospital in its entirety			2
' i feel privileged to be one of the people to have explored this great site before redevelopment commences			2
' after campaigning against the closing of @entity26 , disgruntled local people pointed out that @entity4 became one of the only @entity184 nations not to have a dedicated military hospital			2
since the @entity188 sale of site there are now plans to turn the it into a retirement home with leisure facilities for former @entity4 military personnel			0
patients : although it was originally a military hospital , the @entity5 eventually opened its doors to the public worthless : this piece of equipment could not even be given away the new owner of the building , @entity147 , has insisted everything was done to either redeploy , sell or given equipment away			1
director @entity203 said when the @entity87 opened its new ' super hospital ' the @entity205 , any equipment that could still be used was moved to the new centre			1
the rest of the equipment was either sold or given away			1
during the @entity211 floods , mr @entity203 said he personally worked with several charities to pass on equipment to the crisis hit country in 2010			0
equipment with scrap value was even removed			0
he added : ' the @entity87 took the equipment they thought had value			0
the stuff that remained was obsolete			0
' we sent some equipment to @entity211 , but most of it was not even of use to them			0
' what was there that was of any value was taken			0
what 's left there now is of zero value			0
' most of what 's in the operating theatres could n't be taken out without pulling the walls away			0
' an @entity9 spokeswoman denied abandoning the medical equipment , saying : ' we sold the building and all its contents to a private company , thereby safeguarding taxpayers ’ money			1
' our medical training facilities have now relocated to a number of @entity249 ( @entity250 ) which provide world class medical care to all injured service personnel			0
' warnings : a whole range of medical services were carried out at the @entity5 relocated : the hospital closed when a new ' super hospital ' opened up nearby disposal : a sign even remains giving clear instruction as to what should happen to soiled equipment			1

medical equipment worth millions of pounds has been abandoned by @entity9
the site has been under lock and key since being sold for £ 3 million
among the equipment are x-ray machines and ct scanners
the hospital was where the cure for naval disease scurvy was discovered
