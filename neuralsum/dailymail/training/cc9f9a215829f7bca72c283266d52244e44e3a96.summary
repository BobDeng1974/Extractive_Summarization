@entity0 spends his workday 60 feet below ground awaiting the order he hopes never arrives : to launch the most powerful weapon ever devised by man			1
he is a nuclear ' missileer ' - an airman who does his duty not in the air but in a hole in the ground			1
on both counts - the possibility of firing weapons that could kill millions , and the subterranean confinement - a missileer lives with pressures few others know			1
it 's not active combat , although the @entity21 calls them combat crew members			1
2nd lt. @entity24 , left , and 1st lt. @entity0 check systems in the underground control room where they work a 24 - hour shift at an icbm launch control facility near @entity30 , @entity31 the crew is responsible for controlling and launching the 10 nuclear - tipped @entity34 3 missiles located in remote launch sites under their command an inert @entity34 missile is seen in a training launch tube at @entity39 yet no one can exclude the possibility , remote as it may be , that one day a president will deliver the gut - wrenching order that would compel a missileer to unleash nuclear hell			1
' absolutely , it weighs on your mind , ' @entity0 , 25 , said on a recent afternoon at @entity49 , a minuteman 3 missile launch site near @entity39 , whose @entity51 controls 150 of the nation 's @entity53 missiles			2
it may come as a surprise to some that the @entity21 still operates intercontinental ballistic missiles , or icbms			0
a fleet of seven of the aging helicopters are used to support the 150 @entity34 missiles carrying nuclear warheads which are deployed in the countryside surrounding @entity39 the work can be tedious , but the men must remain on high alert deep in their compound in the unlikely event of an order and therein lies part of the problem for missileers , who feel underappreciated in a military that has long since shifted its main focus to fighting small wars , striking with unmanned drones and countering terrorism and cyberattacks			1
@entity0 , however , says he takes pride in his role			0
it 's not something that 's taken lightly by anybody , ' @entity0 said as he and his crewmate , 23 - year - old 2nd lt. @entity24 , showed visitors around the small launch control center where they were several hours into a 24 - hour watch over a group of 10 missiles			1
it 's a sometimes tedious duty the @entity21 calls ' standing alert			1
' some say their biggest challenge is staying alert			0
lt. @entity0 waits for his co-worker 2nd lt. @entity24 , left , to check identities of visitors before entering the underground control room where they work a 24 - hour shift @entity105 , typically 22 - to 27 - year - old lieutenants and captains , work in pairs , with a relief crew arriving every 24 hours			1
a missileer generally does two ' alerts ' a week			0
it was @entity114 's 118th			2
) it 's not hard to see why some missileers find it hard to adjust to life there			2
an 8 - ton blast door seals their launch control center from a potential incoming nuclear detonation			2
twice last year , launch officers were disciplined after admitting they left the blast door open while a crewmate was asleep - a security violation			1
that and other lapses in discipline , training and leadership were documented by @entity135 over the past year , prompting defense secretary @entity136 to declare that ' something is wrong			1
' the @entity139 launch control center is actually two separate structures			0
an outer protective shell is made of reinforced concrete lined with a steel plate			0
a smaller , box - like enclosure where the missileers work , eat and sleep is suspended inside the protective shell by pneumatic cylinders called " shock isolators " attached to the shell 's ceiling by heavy chains ; the isolators are designed to keep the space stable in the event of a nuclear blast			1
the launch center is accessible only from an above - ground building that resembles a small ranch - style home these underground command posts have changed relatively little since they were built in the early 1960s , although the @entity21 recently committed to refurbishing them to make a missileer 's life a bit easier			1
@entity49 - 01 , the command post an @entity135 reporting team was permitted to visit , had just been repainted and spruced up to remove corrosion caused by water intrusion , giving it what one officer called " that new car smell			2
" the launch center is accessible only from an above - ground building that resembles a small ranch - style home			1
an access shaft descends from a vestibule inside the building , which is controlled by a security team and surrounded by alarms and a chain - link fence			2
the @entity181 has never fired an icbm , other than for flight testing			0
their stated purpose is to help deter nuclear war by convincing a potential attacker that it would have more to lose than to gain			0
the possibility , remote as it may be , that one day a president will deliver the gut - wrenching order that would compel a missileer to unleash nuclear hell ' weighs ' on the men 's minds @entity139 duty is far removed from the glamour , guts and glory associated with the @entity21			1
it not only falls short of the image of a fighter or bomber pilot streaking across enemy skies , it requires sitting , unseen and largely unappreciated , in a stuffy capsule to baby - sit missiles			2
upward of two - thirds of missileers were ' volunteered ' for the job after gaining their officer commission			2
once they complete basic @entity139 training , they are sent on four - year tours to one of three missile bases : @entity30 , @entity217 in @entity218 , or @entity219 in @entity220			1
the responsibility is enormous , the cost of mistakes potentially colossal , ranging from environmental damage to inadvertently triggering a nuclear war			0
over time , with the passing of the @entity227 , the @entity21 lost focus on its nuclear mission			0
it also lost a good deal of what remained of the allure of serving as a missileer			0
2nd lt. @entity24 , left , and 1st lt. @entity0 go through a checklist in the underground control room ' even during the @entity227 while facing down the @entity239 , it could be difficult to convince bright young airmen that what they were doing was worthwhile , ' @entity237 wrote in a research paper in 2011 before becoming vice commander of the @entity244 at @entity217			0
last year he was promoted to commander there but resigned in march 2014 amid a scandal over exam cheating among his missileers			0
in his paper , ' reviving a culture of @entity252 in @entity253 , ' @entity237 called for missileer incentive pay			0
the @entity21 is heeding that advice			0
starting in october , it will offer entry bonuses to newly trained missileers , as well as ' duty pay ' for security forces , missileers and others who operate in the missile fields .			0

@entity105 , typically 22 - to 27 - year - old lieutenants and captains , work in pairs tending man 's most *destructive* weapons in bases far below ground
call responsibility for weapons that could kill millions in an instant a ' sobering ' duty
many say they feel underappreciated as the military shifts forcus to small wars , drones , and the age of cyberattacks
defense secretary @entity290 *worries* ' something is wrong ' after a number of lapses in discipline , training , and leadership are recorded among the men over the past year
