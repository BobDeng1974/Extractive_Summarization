by @entity0 @entity1 shrugged off fears of a @entity4 hangover as they beat a resurgent @entity5 32 - 18 despite the best efforts of @entity7 to move up to second in the @entity9			1
the @entity1 were left heartbroken by neighbours @entity10 in the @entity12 ’s @entity11 final last weekend but remain on course for a first @entity15 appearance after a solid victory at the @entity17			1
@entity18 got the scoring under way in the fifth minute with a try against his former club , who went into the contest on the back of three straight wins , and that was followed by efforts from @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
flying high : @entity29 scores @entity1 's second try against @entity5 to move @entity1 to second @entity7 scored @entity5 ’s sole try in the first half and he went over twice more at the start of the second period to make it a hat - trick			1
@entity39 eased @entity1 ’s nerves with a stunning solo try which @entity42 converted before the stand - off slotted over a penalty to make it a perfect afternoon with the boot			2
@entity18 gave the @entity1 the perfect start when he crashed on to a pass from dummy - half @entity39 and benefited from some weak defence to touch down			1
@entity1 were celebrating again on 14 minutes after good play by @entity42 and @entity30 created the space for @entity51 to score in the corner in acrobatic fashion			2
@entity42 converted from the touchline to make it 12 - 0 , a deficit @entity5 thought they had eaten into midway through the first period , only for @entity58 ’s try to be ruled out for obstruction			0
@entity1 were awarded a penalty at the other end for a high shot on @entity30 and went close themselves when @entity39 was held up over the line			2
the @entity1 did not have to wait too much longer for their third try , @entity30 taking a good offload from @entity31 and showing a good turn of pace to score			1
already - relegated @entity5 registered their first points of the match seven minutes from the break when @entity7 took a pass from @entity72 , playing against his future employers , and stepped his way to the line			0
but the visitors suffered a blow on the stroke of half - time as @entity31 cut back inside untouched for a four - pointer , which @entity42 turned into six with his fourth successful kick			0
@entity7 went over for an almost identical try to his first - half effort two minutes after the break and quickly completed his hat - trick after @entity72 put him through a hole 40 metres out and he rounded @entity30 to score under the posts			0
the @entity1 had to do plenty of defending as @entity5 strived to pull level , which they would have done but for @entity91 ’s fumble just yards from the posts			2
the @entity94 ’s mistake proved costly as @entity39 showed the @entity1 fans what they will miss when he leaves at the end of the season with a brilliant 80 - metre try after taking a quick penalty tap			0
the victory was sealed when @entity42 put over a straightforward penalty two minutes from time			0
