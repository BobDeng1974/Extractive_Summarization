users in @entity3 now see the @entity0 as just another smartphone and not the special product that it once was			0
pictured is a smuggled sets of @entity0 6 are displayed after being found hidden in a tea leaf box at the customs in @entity24 , near the @entity9 border , @entity27 province the @entity28 reported that smugglers were shipping devices to @entity3 because they do not go on sale there for a few weeks and they are already out elsewhere			1
in the past that has meant they can sell them for far higher prices than normal because consumers wanted to be the first to get them			0
but at one electronics market in @entity40 , one retailer was selling the @entity0 6 and the @entity41 for between the equivalent of $ 1,060 ( £ 650 ) and $ 1,436 ( £ 885 )			1
just after the phones came out they were selling on the @entity3 black market for $ 1,960 ( £ 1,200 ) and $ 2,450 ( £ 1,500 ) each , a decline of 54 per cent and 58 per cent respectively			1
criminal gangs who queued up for days in the @entity8 and @entity9 to get the @entity11 devices have been forced to charge less than half because of falling demand			1
one @entity0 seller in @entity40 ’s northwestern tech hub @entity53 said : ‘ stocks of the @entity55 are way too high right now ’ if the trend continues it could mean the end of smugglers queuing up at @entity11 stores at the launch of the newest @entity0 , making unlikely companions to the tech - savvy 20 - somethings who form the bulk of the line			1

@entity3 is n't selling the latest iphones , despite the country being @entity11 's biggest market			2
soon after @entity11 ’s announcement of the @entity76 , @entity3 ’s big three telecom providers removed their online pre-order forms for the new phones			2
the move followed an announcement by @entity11 that the phone 's introduction @entity3 had to be delayed			0
@entity11 is yet to respond to a request by @entity84 about why the announcement was made			0
some experts have speculated that @entity11 is n't selling in @entity3 due to @entity55 leaks , while others suggest it is due to supply chain issues			0
the @entity90 , a @entity92 - based business publication , claims the problem is that @entity11 has n’t yet received a ' network access ' license from @entity3 regulators			0
this was n't an issue for @entity11 previously and why this is the case now has yet to be revealed			0
the main route to @entity3 for smuggled @entity0 is from @entity9 - gangs persuade consumers to buy them using their official id cards , only one of their agents to collects the device from the @entity107			2
when prices were good smugglers could expect to make around $ 163 ( £ 100 ) per device but now one @entity0 seller said that his losses will be ‘ big ’			2
another factor which has put of smugglers is a crackdown by police in @entity3 who have been raiding boats carrying iphones before they land at ports			0
