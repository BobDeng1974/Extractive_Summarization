@entity1 club captain @entity0 is putting all talk of his future on hold as he turns his attention to saturday 's @entity7 final against @entity8			1
the 28 - year - old @entity10 defender made 14 @entity12 appearances as the @entity13 secured a top - four finish and another season of @entity17 football			2
@entity0 , who played in the penalty shoot - out victory over @entity19 in the semi-final , will be hoping to be involved against @entity8 this weekend despite requiring five stitches in a knee injury suffered at @entity23 on the final day of the league campaign			1
bigger prospect : @entity0 says his focus is on the @entity7 final against @entity28 this weekend summer switch ? the @entity1 captain 's future has been doubted in recent weeks if he does play , it could prove to be his last appearance for @entity1 as he strives to find first - team football with just one year left on his contract			1
but @entity0 is keen to keep his mind trained only on delivering the @entity7 to the @entity39 and end a nine - year run without silverware for @entity43 's side			1
' it is not important at the moment , my future , ' he said			2
' we are in front of an @entity50 and my focus is there			2
my future is not important at the moment			0
' we know there has been a lot of talk about not winning a trophy for a long time and so for us it would be important to win the final			1
' memories of a 1 - 0 @entity63 final defeat to @entity64 in 2011 will no doubt weigh heavily on the minds of @entity1 supporters leading into another showepiece game where they enter as the firm favourites			1
@entity0 missed the shock loss two years ago due to a long - standing @entity71 issue and does not want to be recollecting that time in the run - in to the meeting with @entity8			1
big test : @entity43 is looking to end a nine - year trophy drought at @entity76 ' the whole time was difficult for me , to be out injured for such a long time , ' he said			0
' missing big games like finals was never easy			0
i was at @entity76 , i was in the stands			0
it 's a long time ago but it was a very disappointing result and everybody knows that			0
' we ca n't think about it			0
saturday is a different game again			1
there are a lot of changes in the team since then - a lot of players left since then - but we have to make sure it does n't happen again			0
' every final is something special , something different			1
of course , that happened but that 's the past and we have to make sure that does n't happen again			0
' loving life : @entity0 and @entity102 have fun on @entity105 's dj decks at @entity1 's charity ball although @entity0 is looking to avoid a repeat of the @entity64 defeat , when @entity109 capitalised on a defensive error to score a late winner , he knows @entity1 's players will be competing under immense pressure to finally deliver another trophy			1
' there will always be pressure for a cup final , ' he added			2
' the players are used to playing under pressure because if you play for a club like @entity1 , you have to win every single game			1
people expect that so saturday wo n't be different			2
the pressure will be there always to win that game			0
' we are used to the pressure , every game has to be won			0
of course we know that there has been a lot of talk of not winning for nine years but it is a game we have to win			0
' we know there is a lot at stake as well but we go in with a lot of confidence			0
