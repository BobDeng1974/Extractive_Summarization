by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 had four au pairs but claimed not one of them could be traced to back up her story			1
so close were the au pairs to the @entity3 family , they would often travel ahead to ‘ make sure the house was ready for the children ’			1
yet when the expenses watchdog asked for witnesses to the family ’s routine , mrs @entity3 insisted none of the four girls could be contacted			1
@entity3 has been asked to provide witnesses to provide evidence as to how much time she was spending at each residence she told the standards commissioner : ‘ we had four au pairs , all of whom were young girls from abroad ( effectively on a gap year , learning or improving their @entity25 ) and all of whom returned to their homes after their time with us came to an end			1
this relates to a period up to seven and a half years ago ; they were not family friends and i do not remain in touch with any of them			2
’ it is unclear what efforts , if any , mrs @entity3 made in trying to track down these important witnesses to her case			1
@entity3 's @entity44 property , which cost £ 234,000 in 1996 but it is understood the names of the four girls were held back from the commissioner who could have made independent inquiries as to their whereabouts			2
mrs @entity3 had been asked to provide the names and addresses of any witnesses who could back up her claims about the time she spent in each of her homes			1
the minister replied that it would be ‘ a concern to me if anyone observed my family ’s daily movements ’ , adding : ‘ you will be aware of the security issues @entity65 face			2
’ in a 2013 exchange of letters , mrs @entity3 insisted : ‘ i do n’t think anyone outside of my family can provide the sort of evidence that you are looking for			1
’ but when asked if the au pairs might be able to assist , the minister suggested it would be impossible to contact them			1
yet on the basis of her own evidence , the au pairs would appear to have been very much a part of family life in the @entity3 household			1
she said that when she travelled to her constituency at weekends , the au pair would ‘ often travel down on thursday to make sure the house was ready for the children ’			2
mrs @entity3 claimed she spent ‘ most ’ of her nights at her @entity88 home , which was ‘ the centre of family life ’			1
but yesterday a neighbour of one of the properties she rented in @entity88 until around 2008 said : ‘ she was only here occasionally - she lived in @entity97 and would come here for a meeting every now and again			0
it ’s hard to tell for certain how often she was there as we do n’t keep an eye on our neighbours and we are very spaced out around here			0
but i ’m sure she was only here occasionally			0
’ a nearby farmer added : ‘ she moved in when she was first elected			0
i met her once - she came up one @entity107 with her children while i was lambing			0
she was off - duty though , so we did n’t talk about her job			0
but apart from that , she did n’t appear to be there much - though she may have come in nine at night and left at four in the morning			0
’ expenses scandal mp @entity3 has recently moved into a £ 1.2million pound home , four miles from her previous rented home in @entity88 , @entity116 meanwhile in @entity97 , a neighbour of her taxpayer - funded ‘ second home ’ in @entity44 said : ‘ i saw mrs @entity3 coming in and out of there frequently , i think it was her main residence but i could n’t say for sure			1
' i ’d see her on weekends and sometimes doing the garden			0
i know her parents lived there , and you ’d often see her kids too			0
’ the commissioner ruled that mrs @entity3 ’s @entity97 home should have been designated the ‘ main home ’ rather than the @entity88 one			1
this was because she had welcomed her parents and brothers to live there , @entity97 was where her city lawyer husband worked , and where each of her children in turn went to school			0
mrs @entity3 and her husband @entity141 bought the double - fronted @entity143 house in @entity44 for £ 234,000 in 1996			2
but she increased their mortgage several times until it was £ 575,000 - well over twice the amount they paid for it			0
because it was her ‘ second home ’ , she was able to make taxpayers help fund her mortgage interest @entity151 of this year , she sold the house for £ 1.47million , banking a profit of £ 1,236,000			2
she used the proceeds to purchase a £ 1.2million converted barn in @entity116 .			0

@entity3 was asked to provide evidence about how much time she spent at each home
despite having four au pairs , she claimed none of them were contactable
mrs @entity3 said ' they were not family friends '
because of this , mrs @entity3 can not back up her story
