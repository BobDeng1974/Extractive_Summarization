he is n't exactly famous for sitting still - so when unsuspecting fans approached a wax figure of @entity4 for a photo , they did n't suspect a thing			1
but they were given a fright - which soon turned to joy - when the still figure jumped up to surprise them , revealing himself as the @entity14 star player			2
@entity4 , 26 , a point guard with the @entity16 team , held his pose while guests at the @entity20 branch of @entity22 wax museum came filing by			1
at one point , @entity4 pulled off a combo with the actual waxwork , which is suspended next to a basket in a slam dunk pose , by running in from the side and scoring two points himself			1
two points ! at one point @entity4 managed to upstage the dramatic slam - dunking waxwork of himself ( background ) by running in from the sidelines to nab a real basket of his own ' now this looks familiar ' : @entity57 , the star 's mom , had no trouble picking out her real son ' you got me ! ' : @entity4 's waxwork act did n't hold out for long once his mom was on the scene fans who were appreciating the fake @entity4 - and got a sudden upgrade - spoke of their shock and delight to see the real deal			1
one said : ' i just got dunked on by @entity4			0
i showed up , took a picture with his wax figure , and here he comes out behind the curtain ! ' however , one visitor who was n't take in was the star 's own mom			0
@entity57 was also seen approaching her ' waxwork ' son , but escaped being fooled and gave @entity4 and affectionate squeeze on the shoulder , breaking the illusion			2
the stunt was pulled last month , but only came to light a few days ago when @entity83 @entity82 uploaded footage of the incident to its @entity87 channel			0
on the court : @entity4 is pictured above with the @entity89 , for whom he played between 2012 and 2014			0
