scientists are currently competing to create the best invisibility cloak , as imagined in films such as @entity3 and @entity4			0
as yet , no - one has managed to replicate a flexible cloak as worn by the boy wizard , or the cloaking device used by the @entity9 to make their ships invisible to another starship 's sensors , but two @entity15 scientists have created an invisibility cloak that they say is thin and adaptive to different types and sizes of objects			2
unlike other recent cloaks that rely on planes of glass simply bending light in a way that renders small objects temporarily invisible , the researchers have taken an electrical engineering approach , which makes objects undetectable to radar			2
this is the set up of the lab where professor @entity32 and @entity33 have designed and tested a new approach to cloaking - by surrounding an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field			1
the radiated field cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object they said as the technology advances , it could also be adapted to make things invisible to the human eye too			1
professor @entity32 and phd student @entity33 have designed and tested a new approach to cloaking , by surrounding an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field			1
the radiated field cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object , rendering the object invisible to radar , explained the two researchers at the @entity54			1
‘ we 've taken an electrical engineering approach , but that 's what we are excited about , " said professor @entity32			0
‘ it 's very practical			0
’ when light hits an object , such as a postbox and bounces back into a person ’s eyes , they can see it and similarly , when radio waves hit the object , they bounce back to a radar detector and reveal it is a postbox , in a certain location			2
the scientists ’ system wraps the mailbox in a layer of tiny antennas that radiate a field away from the box , cancelling out any waves that would bounce back			1
in this way , the mailbox becomes undetectable to radar			0
usually , when radio waves hit an object , they bounce back to a radar detector ( illustrated ) and reveal its location			2
the engineers surrounded an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field , which cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object , rendering the object invisible to radar while hiding post boxes might not have any immediate military applications , the technology could be used to create a next - generation devices to cloak vehicles			1
professor @entity32 said he and mr @entity33 have demonstrated a new way of cloaking objects			0
‘ it 's very simple			0
instead of surrounding what you 're trying to cloak with a thick metamaterial shell , we surround it with one layer of tiny antennas , and this layer radiates back a field that cancels the reflections from the object			2
’ in their experiment , described in the journal @entity116 , they effectively cloaked a metal cylinder from radio waves using one layer of loop antennas			2
the duo said their system can be scaled up to cloak larger objects using more loops , and the loops could become printed and flat , like a blanket or skin			0
currently the antenna loops must be manually attuned to the electromagnetic frequency they need to cancel , but in future they could function both as sensors and active antennas , adjusting to different waves in real time , much like the technology behind noise - cancelling headphones			1
the ultimate camouflage ? the engineers said their technology could be used to make military vehicles ( pictured ) undetectable to radar systems and the innovation could one day be applied to light , as well as radio waves , potentially making a tank invisible to the human eye the pair began developing a functional invisibility cloak began around 2006 , but their early systems were necessarily large and clunky – to cloak a car , an individual had to completely envelop the vehicle in many layers of metamaterials to ‘ shield ’ it from electromagnetic radiation			1
the size and inflexibility of the approach makes this technique impractical for real - world uses , while earlier attempts to craft thin cloaks were not adaptive and could only work for specific , small objects			0
beyond obvious applications , such as hiding military vehicles or conducting surveillance operations , this cloaking technology could eliminate obstacles , such as structures interrupting signals from cellular base stations that could be cloaked to allow signals to pass by freely , the said			1
the system can also alter the signature of a cloaked object , making it appear bigger , smaller , or even shifting it in space			0
their tests showed the cloaking system works with radio waves but could also work with light waves in the future , using the same principle as the antenna technology matures , which could mean objects could be invisible to the human eye			1
‘ there are more applications for radio than for light , ’ professor @entity32 said			0
‘ it 's just a matter of technology - you can use the same principle for light and the corresponding antenna technology is a very hot area of research			0

engineers have surrounded an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field , cancelling out waves scattered off it
the @entity54 researchers believe their innovation could be used to hide military vehicles and to conduct surveillance operations
as the technology advances , it could also be adapted to make objects invisible to the human eye too
