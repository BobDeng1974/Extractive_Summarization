separately , provisional estimates show 7,074 hospital admissions for people under 18 due to alcohol since january , according to a written parliamentary answer to shadow public health minister @entity37			2
mrs @entity37 said ministers needed to ‘ get a grip ’ on binge drinking adding : ‘ the alarm bells should be ringing with the publication of these figures			2
’ ‘ it is clear that for [ health secretary ] @entity45 , the be-all and end - all is whether his friends in big business are happy , and , unfortunately , it is costing our @entity51 and @entity54 families an absolute fortune			2
’ today 's data also showed an increase in the total number of hospital admissions for alcohol in @entity29 , from 1,056,962 in 2009/10 to 1,173,386 in 2010/11 , a rise of 11 per cent			1
in 2002/03 , the figure stood at 510,780 admissions for alcohol			0

mr @entity45 blamed the previous @entity73 government for fostering easy availability of alcohol			0
he said : ‘ these figures are disturbing evidence that , despite total consumption of alcohol not increasing recently , we have serious problems with both binge - drinking and long - term excessive alcohol abuse in a minority of people			0
‘ these consistent rises show @entity73 took their eye off the ball on tackling alcohol abuse during their 13 years in power			0
their reckless policies included the decision to unleash a 24 - hour drinking culture in our country			0
‘ we have taken real action by imposing high taxes on super-strength beers and ciders and banning below - cost alcohol sales			0
’ under the ban on the sale of low - cost alcohol , which will come into force on april 6 next year , shops and bars will not be able to sell drinks for less than the tax paid on them			1
but health campaigners , led by the @entity108 , said the below - cost price ban would make little difference to rising numbers of problem drinkers , claiming the price ‘ floor ’ was too low to have any impact			0
mr @entity45 said further measures will be set out in an alcohol strategy in the new year .			1

@entity24 sees a rise of 14 % in just one year
