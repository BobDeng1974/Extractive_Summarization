talismanic striker @entity0 was on target but also missed a penalty as @entity3 overcame a stubborn @entity4 2 - 0 on tuesday to set up an @entity6 quarter - final with old rivals @entity7			1
the 2007 champions were not at their best but goals by @entity0 and a late second from @entity12 sent them through from @entity13 as runners - up behind holders @entity16 , who made it three wins out of three by beating @entity19 2 - 0 in @entity20			1
@entity0 's 48th minute header was only @entity3 's second goal in the tournament and their disjointed attack , which struggled to penetrate the tournament 's leakiest backline , will need to improve against a mean @entity28 defence which has yet to concede			2
@entity0 ( left ) celebrates after scoring the opener for @entity3 against @entity4 in the @entity30 @entity0 also missed a penalty during the match as @entity3 edged through to the quarter - finals @entity34 ( centre ) sealed the game to set up a meeting with arch rivals @entity7 @entity0 has long been the focal figure of the @entity41 frontline , the last link to the @entity44 winning side , but his powers are clearly on the wane			1
his winning goal was a case of third time lucky			0
having failed to hit the target in two previous subdued displays against @entity16 and @entity19 he netted with his third chance in as many second half minutes to break the @entity55 resistance			0
the 31 - year - old skipper hooked a right foot shot wide in the 47th minute before @entity59 's outstretched leg blocked his next effort moments later but he finally found a way through from the resulting corner			0
@entity3 's @entity63 ( left ) accidentally kicks teammate @entity64 in the face @entity64 is forced to take one for the team as @entity63 's errant boot connects with his face substitute @entity69 whipped the ball in from the right and @entity0 rose highest to connect with a near post header to break the deadlock			2
@entity4 , thumped 4 - 0 by a wasteful @entity16 and then 5 - 1 by @entity19 , should have pulled level just three minutes later when a careless pass by @entity76 allowed @entity77 clear on goal but the @entity55 forward saw his shot blocked by the legs of goalkeeper @entity82			1
@entity0 , who has more than 130 caps for his country , had the chance to settle the contest just on the hour mark when @entity3 were awarded a soft penalty			0
@entity4 fans wave flags during their @entity92 soccer match with @entity3 an @entity3 fan takes a selfie with player @entity95 before the start of the game @entity98 was adjudged to have shoved @entity99 in the back but @entity0 could only hit a low , soft penalty which the towering stand - in @entity4 goalkeeper @entity103 parried away to his left			1
the chances continued to come for the @entity41 in a second period of high intensity after a drab first half with the pace and driving runs of @entity12 causing problems for the debutants			0
the attacking midfielder was inevitably the man to make the game safe when his low 88th minute strike from the edge of the penalty area sailed past a wrong - footed @entity103 .			0

@entity0 scored as @entity3 defeated @entity4 2 - 0 in the @entity30
