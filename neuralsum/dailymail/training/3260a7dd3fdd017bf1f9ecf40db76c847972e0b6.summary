by @entity0 published : 21:12 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 1 june 2012 @entity1 claim they are the hardest - working @entity3 nation , despite their ' bad kebab ' economy			1
in a poll of residents of eight of @entity3 's leading nations , seven agreed that @entity10 is the hardest working country on the continent			1
the exception was @entity1 , whose citizens claim they are @entity3 's hardest workers			1
@entity3 's ' hardest workers ' ... on strike : protesters carrying the @entity1 flag try to storm the @entity19 in @entity20 during a 24 hour general strike in february @entity1 perceptions come despite the precarious state of their national finances , which commentators have claimed must be due to some extent to a national culture of laziness			1
indeed , the people of @entity30 , @entity10 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and the @entity33 all accused the @entity1 of being the least hardworking @entity3 , undoubtedly due to the problems the country faces			1
this week @entity36 came under fire for blasting the @entity1 economy as a ' bad kebab ' which may best be ' vomited out ' by the rest of the eurozone			2
the @entity43 presenter was given a tongue - lashing by a @entity1 guest and criticised on @entity46 after his comments , which were branded ' offensive ' and ' disrespectful ' to the country and its people			2
anger : live on air mr @entity36 said @entity1 could be vomited out of the @entity51 like a bad kebab , to the anger of a guest the abrasive @entity56 journalist was describing @entity1 's political and financial problems when he used the ' bad kebab ' analogy to explain what the rest of the @entity60 may want to do with them			2
but after he was criticised mr @entity36 backed down , not defending his analogy			0
@entity1 has another election in mid-june , which could decide whether or not they stay in the @entity51			0
but as pro and anti-bailout parties are neck and neck in the polls another stalemate is possible , which could force @entity51 countries like @entity10 and @entity73 to throw them out themselves			0
' so the rest of the @entity60 now contemplates something we were being told was n't conceivable recently , that , like a bad kebab , @entity1 is vomited out of the single @entity3 currency , ' mr @entity36 said			2
but former @entity1 finance minister @entity78 then turned on him and told him off live on air			0
' i take issue with your bad kebab analogy , which i find offensive , ' he said			0
' the @entity1 economy is in a crisis and the @entity1 people are going through a lot and they deserve some respect			0
i really did not find that very appropriate			0
' @entity90 : former @entity1 finance minister @entity78 told mr @entity36 off live on air solidarity : socialist protesters march through @entity20 during a rally to mark @entity95			0
@entity97 data shows they do actually work the longest hours in @entity3 in fact , @entity1 perceptions of their own efforts are rather more in tune with reality than it may seem from their current difficulties			1
recent data from the @entity97 showed @entity1 actually do work the longest hours in @entity3 , toiling an average of 2,017 hours a year - compared to 1,647 in the @entity30 , or a leisurely 1,408 in @entity10			1
however , working longer hours does not necessarily lead to greater productivity , and @entity1 's productivity is low , relative to other @entity3 economies			1
corruption is also a major problem , with @entity1 viewed by other @entity3 as having the second highest levels after @entity115 - ridden @entity114 , and @entity1 regard their own land as the most corrupt of all			2
@entity10 was regarded as the least corrupt by those polled .			0

and @entity97 data shows they do indeed work the longest hours in @entity3
