by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 21 may 2013 @entity2 has captured the world 's largest panoramic photo at 6,000 miles long and 120 miles wide using a satellite orbiting 438 miles above the @entity6			1
the swath is made up of 56 still images taken during the satellite 's final orbit and stretches from northern @entity11 down to @entity12			1
@entity2 's @entity13 ( @entity13 ) scanned the surface of the @entity6 during orbit in april and took just 15 minutes to take the shots			1
zoom in in the full image below ( may not work on all devices ) image of the globe showing the swath of land captured by @entity2 's @entity23 as it orbited the @entity6 at 17,000 miles per hour			1
the seamless swath is made up of 56 images travelling from northern @entity11 , over the @entity26 and down into @entity12			1
the camera took just 15 minutes to shoot the panoramic image , which is 6,000 miles long and 120 miles wide the @entity13 travels at 438 miles ( 705 kilometres ) above the @entity6			1
it orbits at speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour			0
the satellite takes just 20 minutes to complete one orbit of the planet			0
it is the eighth satellite of its kind to orbit the @entity6 and will soon be renamed @entity36 8			0
the first satellie , known as @entity38 or @entity38 1 , was launched in 1972			0
@entity38 8 took 56 images during its final orbit in april			2
these images , stretching from northern @entity11 to @entity12 , were stitched together by @entity2 to form a seamless swath of land			1
it is the world 's largest panoramic photo and is 6,000 miles long and 120 miles wide			1
after two months of testing and calibration in space , @entity2 fired @entity13 into space in february			2
it travelled to 438 miles ( 705 kilometres ) above the @entity6 and orbited the planet			2
during its final flight in april it scanned a 120 - mile wide swath of land starting at northern @entity11 and finishing at @entity12			1
the @entity13 took 56 individual shots of the land as it orbited the @entity6 and @entity2 stitched these images together to form the seamless swath			1
each shot includes clouds , haze and varying angles of sunlight			0
the photos were enhanced using the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) that can capture images at a higher - resolution that what human eyes can see			0
@entity2 's @entity13 orbited the @entity6 at around 17,000 miles per hour ( 27,000 kph ) and completed one full orbit in 20 minutes			1
it took the @entity13 just 15 minutes to capture the 6,000 - mile - long swath			2
one of the first images taken by the @entity2 's @entity13 shows irregularly - shaped fields and farms around the braided channels of the @entity75 in central @entity11			1
the @entity75 river is the longest river in @entity77 stretching 2,294 miles			0
this shot is one of 56 images captured and stitched together by @entity2 to form a 6,000 - mile - long panoramic photo this image , taken by @entity2 's @entity13 , shows the @entity84 city of @entity85 , along the coast of the @entity26			1
@entity85 has largest sea port on the @entity26 , and is the second largest city in @entity84 after the capital , @entity90 , with a population of 3.2 million			0
all the images in the swath have been enhanced using @entity2 's @entity64 , which means they are higher - resolution that what the human eye can naturally see a video produced by @entity2 shows the path taken by the @entity13			1
there is also an interactive @entity101 map below			0
the first image taken by the @entity13 showed irregularly - shaped fields and farms around the braided channels of the @entity75 in central @entity11 , an area with a long and rich history of agriculture			2
the middle image was taken of the @entity84 city of @entity85 , along the coast of the @entity26			0
the last image reveals the eastern shore of @entity113 € ™ s largest lake , @entity114			0
the shallow water is clouded with tan sediment and green plant growth			0
@entity13 was launched as a joint mission of @entity2 and the @entity119 ( @entity119 )			2
instruments on @entity13 collect data in strips , or paths , which are divided into smaller scenes for cataloguing and storage at the @entity127 of @entity119 ( @entity119 )			0
@entity2 's 6,000 - mile - long panoramic photo ended in @entity12			1
this image was one of the last shots captured by the @entity13 during its final orbit			2
it shows the eastern shore of @entity12 's largest lake , @entity114			2
named after @entity135 , the lake has a surface area of 26,600 square miles and contains around 2,750 cubic kilometers of water the beginning , end , and center of the swath correspond to images taken by previous @entity38 models including the @entity145 in 1982 , @entity38 5 from 1984 , and @entity36 7 , which was launched into space in 1999 to collect images and data			2
all the images captured by @entity36 satellites are catalogued in a path - row system called the @entity152			0
the latest satellite is still in its calibration and checkout phase , and the images shown on the @entity101 map are considered test data			0
later this month , the satellite will be handed over to @entity119 and renamed @entity36 8			0
after this point the satellite will be considered operational and any data it captures will then be available online			0
