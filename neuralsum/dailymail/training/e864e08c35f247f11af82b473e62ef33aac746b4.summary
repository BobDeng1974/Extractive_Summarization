by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 11:04 est , 20 september 2012 it is hard to decide who comes top in the beauty stakes out of these two vibrant winged creatures			2
together , they make the perfect tableau - the colourful butterly perching delicately on the head of the pretty ruby - throated hummingbird in @entity9 , @entity10 the larger animal is clearly not too happy with the competition , however			1
ahead of the game : talented photographer @entity14 managed to capture the perfect picture when the butterfly landed on the bird 's head - before it was shaken off it repeatedly shakes off the persistent butterfly , and talented photographer @entity14 had to be quick to snatch his photos in the moments the smaller creature found its footing			1
mr @entity14 had been watching the territorial hummingbird flying back and forth from its branch all morning , but just as he got the perfect picture , the bothersome insect squeezed into the shot			0
the 53 - year - old nature photographer was visiting a local butterfly aviary with his sister for her birthday			1
he said the confrontation between bird and insect lasted just seconds but the brave butterfly came back twice to have another try			1
quiet time : the hummingbird had been sitting calmly on a branch in @entity9 , not expecting any interruption ' we take our cameras everywhere with us , and decided on the butterfly aviary because it offers loads of opportunities for really colourful pictures , ' he said			1
' i had adjusted my light and shutter speed to try and get the perfect shot of a hummingbird taking off			0
' we were there for about 20 minutes , when all of a sudden a small patch of light broke through the foliage and illuminated the bird			2
' just as i was poised to take a picture , a butterfly came flying in and landed on his head			0
the hummingbird almost instantly shook the butterfly off , but the butterfly immediately came back and tried to land a second time			0
pretty little things : the bird is interrupted by an equally beautiful butterfly swooping into his personal space ' this time the hummingbird lurched backwards to rid himself of the butterfly and then it was over			2
the whole thing only lasted a few seconds			0
' ' even though the action i got was not the action i anticipated			0
it was better than i could have imagined			0
' ruby - throated hummingbirds weigh just 3.5 grams ( 0.1 ounces ) and measure just nine centimetres ( 3.5 inches ) long , with a wingspan that could fit in the palm of an adult human hand .			1
