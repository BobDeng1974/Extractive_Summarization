@entity1 's 2 - 1 win over @entity2 in sunday 's ' @entity3 ' may have put them four points clear at the top of @entity6 but they will be kicking themselves for not taking a host of second - half chances and grabbing the head - to - head advantage			1
if @entity2 manage to draw level on points with their great rivals over the remaining 10 games - and they have what looks on paper like a slightly easier run - in - they will snatch the title because they beat @entity1 3 - 1 in @entity2 in october			1
head - to - head record is used before goal difference to separate teams with equal points and @entity2 famously pipped @entity1 to the title in 2006 - 07 despite having scored 12 fewer goals and conceded seven more			1
@entity1 and @entity25 could miss out on the @entity6 title to @entity2 with their head - to - head record 1 ) head to head points 2 ) head to head goal difference 3 ) head to head goals scored 4 ) goal difference 5 ) goals scored any disappointment @entity1 coach @entity35 and the players may be feeling on monday morning will be outweighed by their joy at seeing off @entity2 at the @entity39 , thanks to a superb @entity25 goal 11 minutes after half time			1
watched by almost 100,000 fans packed into the giant stadium and millions more around the world , @entity42 had put @entity1 ahead in the 19 minute before @entity46 levelled for @entity2 in minute 31			2
' for the moment it is the most important goal i have scored for @entity1 and it has an extra significance considering who we were playing , ' a jubilant @entity25 , who debuted for the club in october 's ' @entity3 ' after a four - month ban for biting , told reporters			1
@entity25 ( 9 ) slots home his spectacular winner to put @entity1 four points clear at the top of @entity6 @entity46 ( right ) silenced the @entity1 crowd after equalising for @entity2 in the first half ' there is a long way to go and we know that winning the league is going to be very tough , ' added the @entity68 striker			2
' just like in all the leagues , you never know what can happen if you relax just a little			0
' real coach @entity72 and his players , meanwhile , will be wondering how they let slip a match they seemed to be well in control of after @entity46 's leveller			2
the @entity79 captain was almost completely anonymous in the second half and @entity2 's @entity82 winger @entity81 also made little impact			0
' in the end we suffered because of a slight lack of cool heads in our efforts to equalise , ' @entity72 told a news conference			0
' we played too many long balls without a clear idea , ' added the @entity92			0
' it was a good hour , and 30 minutes that were n't so good			0
' the @entity95 is mobbed by his team - mates following his goal but they could still miss out on the title @entity81 ( centre ) struggled during the game and has come under a lot of criticism in recent months			0

if both sides are level on points at the end of the *season* , @entity2 would win the title *due* to their head - to - head record this campaign
goal difference is fourth in *deciding* the winner and @entity1 may come to *regret* missing a whole host of chances at the @entity39
@entity1 *defeated* real 2 - 1 in the second @entity3 on sunday
@entity72 's won side 3 - 1 in the first tie to give them the advantage
