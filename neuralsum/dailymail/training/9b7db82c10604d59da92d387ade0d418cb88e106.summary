by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 13 december 2012 not a single driver breaking the speed limit on the @entity3 has been issued with a ticket from its new overhead cameras over the past year			1
a network of 36 digital cameras has been installed along the busy @entity9 orbital motorway by the @entity10 , but the machines are yet to be switched on , according to a report			1
the agency , which has blamed ' technical and legal difficulties ' for the blunder , said it was working with police to solve the problem as a ' matter of urgency '			1
' incompetence ' : safety groups hit out at the @entity10 after it emerged that no tickets have been issued from its network of overhead speeding cameras on the @entity3 over the past year according to a report in the @entity26 , the failure emerged when the @entity28 website tried to identify which camera along the stretch of road had raised the most money in speeding penalties over the year			1
in fact , it discovered , the cameras - the first of which was installed in 2009 - have failed to catch a single speeding driver			2
the @entity10 , which owns the network , said it was yet to receive statutory authority to use the new cameras on the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 stretches of the @entity3			1
the cameras covering these areas have not even been tested yet , the agency admitted			0
in parts where it does have permission to put the cameras into use , the agency has been beset by ' technical ' difficulties surrounding the upgrade of the old - style machines to the new , digital generation , it said			2
enforcement : cameras have been used to catch speeding drivers on the @entity3 - one of @entity66 's busiest motorways - since 1995 temporary average - speed cameras monitoring stretches of roadworks along the motorway are understood to be working			2
a spokesman for the @entity10 , who was unable to say how much the network of cameras cost or when they would be put into use , said that mandatory speed limits were still enforceable , and that the onus was on drivers to obey them			1
cameras have been used to catch drivers breaking the limit on the route since 1995			0
police patrols also enforce limits on the motorway			0
@entity87 , @entity89 's road safety spokesman , described the revelation as ' unbelievable '			0
' the @entity3 is already used as a racetrack by number of reckless drivers			0
if there is one place where we need working cameras it is on that stretch of motorway , ' he told the newspaper .			0

not a single ticket has been issued from the motorway 's network of 36 overhead digital cameras over the past year
@entity10 say ' technical and legal difficulties ' have *prevented* it from switching on the cameras
around *500,000* drivers use the @entity9 orbital motorway every *day*
