by @entity0 @entity0 has picked her way through 60 of @entity3 's collection of party dresses and come up with the best eight to cover all party occasions this time last year i stepped through the door to @entity11 ’s magnificent @entity10 penthouse feeling great			1
sportsmen , politicians and a few showbiz faces filled the room , with its sensational views of the @entity17			1
but in my new little black dress , complete with flattering scooped neckline and flouncy full skirt , i felt i held my own			1
the dress was a @entity23 number — classic and understated rather than attention - grabbing , but i received more compliments on it than i can remember			1
i felt stylish , comfortable and , more importantly , sexy			1
( judging from the look on my husband @entity30 ’s face , he agreed			2
) such is the power of the @entity33 , or @entity33 , a garment which can take a woman from frumpy to fabulous in the time it takes to do up a zip and slip on some stockings			2
and — joy ! — never have we had more varieties from which to choose			2
after months of unflattering jumpsuits and garish neons being the height of fashion , the lbd is back with a vengeance on the @entity23 this season , nowhere more so than at @entity3 , which has produced an incredible 60 lbds in time for the @entity50 season			1
its range promises cuts and fabrics to suit any age and occasion , but is there anything on offer which can hold a candle to the dress which caused interested looks at @entity11 ’s glamorous party ? to save you time , i ’ve reviewed all @entity3 ’s @entity64 , and here are my pick of the best ... the secret support dress , £ 59 , ( left ) has been voted best for a hot date while the £ 45 black ruched dress with sleeves scored a perfect 10/10 for dressing up or down best for a hot date @entity73 , £ 59 maybe i am being a little prim , but this is too fitted for me			1
i feel like i am wearing a girdle , and it does pull in tummy , thighs and waist to give an hourglass shape			2
it ’s a dress for a date			2
but at 73 years old , dates do n’t come along that often ! it ’s also a little short for me			2
however , at this time of year @entity30 and i often have parties to go to and he would love to see me in this			1
6/10 best for dressing up — @entity88 black ruched dress with sleeves , £ 45 this is my favourite			1
it drapes beautifully , giving a lovely , feminine silhouette and is comfortable , too			2
it would work well for a @entity96 lunch in town or for a casual supper with friends			2
it ’s can be dressed up or down , as well as being impossible to crease			2
10/10 for glamour , @entity0 recommends the autograph leather pencil dress , £ 249 ( left ) , and for attending winter parties the velvet sparkly dress , £ 45 , provides a touch of fun @entity108 autograph leather pencil dress , £ 249 nobody ’s too old for leather if it ’s cut well and i love that this dress fits like a glove			1
it reminds me of a @entity118 sheath dress and it feels very soft against bare skin			0
i think i ’d go up a size — i ’m usually a ten — so that i could wear it with a shirt underneath , which would work for a daytime look			0
this would be a great dress to go from desk to drinks in , but my only gripe is the length : i would prefer another inch or so			0
it ’s more expensive than the other dresses , but still very good value for leather			1
8/10 best for a winter party velvet sparkly dress , £ 45 this is fun and i love the puffed sleeves			1
the material is stretchy ( no need for a zip ) and it drapes well so does n’t feel tight but holds its shape			0
if , like me , you are a woman of a certain age , i would recommend wearing this with a statement necklace , because there is quite a bit of decolletage on show			0
i am a little self - conscious about my scraggy neck , but chunky jewellery works wonders			0
pick up the gold fleck in the fabric with a pair of gold heels			0
9/10 for any business dinners look no further than this hand beaded dress with lace sleeves , £ 79 ( left ) , while the elegant black lace dress £ 69 ( right ) is perfect for cocktail parties best for a business dinner hand - beaded dress with lace sleeves , £ 79 this is a very formal style which can be a little ageing			1
it ’s safe for any occasion , but almost too demure and conservative			0
lots of women my age will like the cut , but i prefer a little more flair			0
it would look better on someone with a bit more cleavage than me			0
but the lace is good quality , and soft rather than itchy			0
6/10 best for cocktail parties black lace dress , £ 69 my head is not usually turned by fads , but lace does seem to be everywhere this year , and i ’d rather buy this from @entity3 than spend a fortune on a designer version			1
it ’s a great party dress — the neckline and sleeves are flattering , adding shape to the decolletage			0
my husband would love this because it ’s demure , but a bit flirty , too			0
9/10 adventurous under - 30s willing to show a bit of leg could opt for the @entity206 skater dress with embellished neckline , £ 59 , ( left ) while for the all - important @entity50 day the velvet dress with sweetheart neckline and lace sleeves has it covered at £ 45 @entity211 limited edition skater dress with embellished neckline , £ 59 for a sleeveless dress , this is rather forgiving			1
the cutaway shoulders are flattering and the pretty neckline draws the eye from any glimpse of the dreaded bingo wings			0
but while the fabric looks and feels expensive , it is far too short for mature ladies like me			0
5/10 best for christmas day velvet dress with sweetheart neckline and lace sleeves , £ 45 this is what i would describe as a @entity50 - y dress because i would be unlikely to wear it at any other time			1
and you really ca n’t beat the warmth of a velvet dress with sleeves			0
the dress could be an inch shorter — on the knee rather than below			0
but the sleeves are lovely , and i like the little heart print which is very on - trend			0
7/10 @entity244 ’s verdict : @entity3 has done itself proud ! the lbd should fulfil two purposes : to make its wearer feel elegant and chic ; and to draw admiring glances			1
these certainly tick both boxes			0
i ’m overjoyed that most of the new black dresses from @entity3 come with sleeves , as , like most mature ladies , i do n’t usually like to reveal my arms			1
there are plenty of versatile styles here that could take me from glitzy parties to casual dinners over the next few weeks without breaking the bank			1
now there ’s just one problem : which lbd to choose ?			0
