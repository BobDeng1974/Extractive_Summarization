last week an exasperated @entity46 told service chiefs : ‘ you do the fighting , i ’ll do the talking			2
’ yesterday dr @entity2 waded into the row			2
‘ we must be very careful , those of us who have authority in defence , in discussing the sustainability of our mission , ’ he said			2
‘ people ’s lives are at stake			2
we may have to reprioritise some of our assets – but let us make it clear that there can be only one message that goes out to @entity19			2
‘ that is : we have the military capability , political resolve and legal authority to see through what we started			2
we will continue our mission until our mission succeeds and @entity35 must get no other signal than that			0

the move has been seen as revenge for tensions that have built up between the government and the military			0
but the three service chiefs will get more control over their individual budgets including how to split funds between training , personnel and equipment			0
