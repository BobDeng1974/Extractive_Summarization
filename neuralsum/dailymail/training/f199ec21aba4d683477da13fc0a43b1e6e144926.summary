by @entity0 the culinary creations of @entity2 might be a little basic for our modern tastes , but a new study suggests that they could cook up a warm stew – even if they did n’t have any pots or pans			2
it has long been known that @entity2 , who lived around 30,000 years ago , were skilled with fire – and now palaeontologists think they may have invented boil - in - the - bag cuisine			2
experts had thought that @entity16 were able to thrive , while @entity2 died , thanks to their ability to heat up food , but new evidence suggests that @entity2 boiled their food too			1
boil - in - the - bag : palaeontologist @entity21 thinks that @entity2 boiled their food in a bag made of skin or a birch bark tray to soften meat			1
they are known to have been adept at using fires ( illustrated ) in january a team of @entity30 archaeologists uncovered the site of a large hearth dating to around 300,000 years ago			0
the discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in @entity36 , an archaeological site near present - day @entity37 in @entity30			2
historians have long questioned when humans began to control fire in order to use heat to suit their daily needs and the find hints that prehistoric humans had a highly advanced social structures and intellectual capacity			0
a thick deposit of wood ash in the centre of the cave was discovered and infrared spectroscopy used to find that in the ash were specks of bone and soil that had been heated to very high temperatures – ‘ conclusive proof ’ of a hearth			0
the site also contained large numbers of burnt animal bones , which the experts think is further evidence that cave men used fires to cook meat			1
the findings build upon other evidence that suggests the organisation of various ‘ household ’ activities into different parts of the cave , points to an organisation of space and a kind of social order that is typical of modern humans			0
cooking makes certain nutrients and higher levels of fat available to a digestive system compared to some raw foods			0
@entity21 , an archaeologist at the @entity87 , told a meeting at the @entity89 in @entity90 : ‘ i think it ’s pretty likely the @entity2 boiled ’			2
his belief is based upon ancient bones and spears @entity95 reported			0
professor @entity21 thinks that @entity2 boiled their food in a bag made of skin - likely an animal 's paunch - or a bark tray , which would have worked because water will boil at a temperature slightly lower than the one needed to set the material holding it on fire			1
‘ you can boil in just about anything as long as you take it off the flame pretty quickly , ’ he explained			0
animal bones found at sites known to have been used by @entity2 are 90 per cent free of gnawing marks , which suggests that fat had been heated and cooked off			1
a 2011 study also hints that @entity2 might have heated grains			2
however , other academics are not so sure			0
@entity116 of the @entity117 in @entity118 , said she is ' not convinced ' that they went as far as boiling food in bags or on bark			2
on fire : while evidence of a hearth ( marked with arrow ) at least 300,000 years old has been found in @entity30 and is proof that @entity2 were adept at using fire , most historians agree that the advent of boiling by heating stones and dropping them into water arrived too late for @entity2 neanderthals probably used an animal paunch to make the bags as they only needed to tie off one of the holes and push food inside from one end of the oesophagus , professor @entity21 told @entity139			1
to make bark cooking containers , they would have simply folded bark into a shape capable of holding a meaty mixture that would n't leak			0
neanderthals were pretty sophisticated when it came to using tools , which could have been made from wood or other perishable materials , professor @entity21 explained			0
' unfortunately what preserves to archaeologists is primarily stone tools which are largely the tools ( knives , scrapers , and the like ) used to make other tools and equipment , the latter made of perishable materials that we seldom see			0
' while evidence of a hearth at least 300,000 has been found in @entity30 and is proof that @entity2 were adept at using fire , most historians agree that the advent of boiling by heating stones and dropping them into water arrived too late for @entity2			1
the earliest evidence of stones used in this way dates back 26,000 years when @entity2 were extinct			1
however , there is evidence that @entity2 made adhesive for their spears from birch tar around 200,000 years ago , so they had good knowledge of the material			1
@entity174 of @entity176 ’s @entity175 told the meeting that making birch tar is complex and requires an oxygen - free vessel , demonstrating that @entity2 were used to manipulating birch and could have lit cigar - like rolls of bark buried in holes to cook the tar in the correct conditions to prevent it exploding .			1

@entity188 thinks @entity2 boiled food in bags made of skin or a bark trays - but other experts disagree
animal bones found at @entity2 sites are 90 *%* free of gnawing marks , suggesting that fat had been heated and cooked off
evidence of @entity202 man using heated stones to boil water dates back 26,000 years - after the @entity2 died out
but they used a sophisticated *technique* to turn birch bark into glue
