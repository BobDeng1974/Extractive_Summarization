the presence of 33 - year - old @entity1 in southern @entity2 for thursday night 's game against @entity4 underlines that @entity5 and their manager @entity6 are taking the @entity7 seriously			1
@entity1 was one of the @entity9 players controversially left out of a tie in the same competition against @entity12 in 2009 – a move that backfired on manager @entity14 who was pilloried by fans thereafter and resigned the following year			1
yet , despite being sandwiched between big @entity17 clashes against @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity1 has been asked to travel nearly 5,000 miles by @entity6 – as have other big - hitters @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity6 wants to win the @entity7 and has selected a strong squad to face @entity4 @entity6 , in his first @entity27 campaign as a manager and already with three points on the board after beating @entity31 , says emphatically : ' of course we are taking this seriously			1
i do n’t think it is a question mark			0
' we got in @entity36 because we worked hard for 12 months			0
if we want to carry on developing and growing we need to develop a winning mentality and to do that we need to be ready for the next game			2
' i think the squad is big enough , we have had a few injuries and they are going to put a bit of pressure in terms of demands on certain players and we maybe have to regenerate them further down the line in the season			2
' in terms of taking the game seriously , i expect every game to be a real test to go as far as we can go and i want that to be the mentality in the club			2
we can not afford to dismiss any game this season , it is the opposite			0
@entity58 was left out of the @entity9 squad for their 2009 @entity7 tie against @entity12 ' i always felt that @entity27 football is part of our dna , we started back in this competition in the 50s and every opportunity to create a good memory we take it with both hands			1
' it is the first time we have come to @entity2 , yes we will make changes but that does not mean we do n’t want to win			0
we expect that everyone on the pitch knows what it means to play for @entity5 and wants to win			2
and they will be able to cope with this club wanting to win every game , that ’s the mentality			0
' if @entity21 gets the nod over @entity84 , it will be the @entity86 goalkeeper 's 21st game in @entity36 for @entity5 – a club record			1
@entity88 is out of the match and will be on the sidelines for around eight weeks with a hamstring injury @entity19 await on sunday lunchtime and three players with injury problems @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 have stayed at home for treatment			0
it is possible all three will be able to face @entity19 , with @entity97 considered likeliest			0
@entity102 international @entity88 is also missing with a hamstring injury that is likely to keep him out for several weeks			0
@entity4 , formed as recently as 2008 , are unbeaten in the @entity105 this season after nine games though they are also something of draw specialists and got a 1 - 1 result in @entity111 in their opening group game			1
@entity5 's 500 - strong army of travelling fans will be supplemented by a group of @entity2 @entity5 , a fan club set up after former @entity2 international @entity117 played at @entity118			1
@entity120 defender @entity119 played 14 times for @entity122 in the @entity17 .			0

@entity6 has *included* the likes of @entity22 , @entity1 and @entity24 in his squad to face @entity4 on thursday
in total its almost a 5,000 mile round trip for the @entity7 clash
@entity5 won their first group game 4 - 1 against @entity31
