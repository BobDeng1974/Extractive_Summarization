@entity1 's new signing arrives from @entity2 after receiving rave reviews for his performances with @entity6			1
with @entity9 and @entity10 also showing an interest @entity8 's side managed to nip in and sign the midfield protegee for just £ 3million			1
here , @entity13 explains what all the fuss is about			0
so who is this guy i 'm hearing whispers about ? name : @entity21 club : @entity1 age : 19 position : central midfield arrival : @entity1 's new signing @entity21 holds his blue shirt aloft at the club 's training ground in @entity31 i ’m going to need more than that ... @entity21 has played for @entity6 since the age of 10 and progressed through the ranks , enjoying his most productive campaign last season by scoring 11 goals in the @entity40 top tier			1
he has appeared for the @entity42 - 21 national side and was included in the 30 - man senior squad for the @entity44 in @entity45 before the numbers were trimmed by manager @entity47			2
so why all the fuss ? @entity1 technical director @entity49 watched when @entity21 scored the only goal for @entity6 , as they beat city rivals rnk 1 - 0 and @entity8 has sanctioned the move			1
last september he scored both goals as @entity6 beat rivals @entity56 2 - 0 and was a key figure in his side finishing third in the table			2
talent : @entity21 has played for @entity2 under 21s and was named in the provisional 30 - man @entity44 squad what ’s his style ? @entity21 is a box - to - box midfielder , starting deeper but able to roam and provide a real goal threat			1
defensive duties are not neglected however			0
he is a good passer and likes shooting from range			0
so , a bit like ? he has been compared to @entity71 on occasions because of his nationality and vision but at 6ft 1in is taller , reminding some of former @entity1 player @entity75 by his own words , a bona fide @entity77 legend is an inspiration			1
‘ my favourite player is @entity82 , ’ he says			1
international quality : @entity84 ( left ) training with the @entity40 national team ahead of the @entity44 how much is he worth and what happens next ? @entity1 have paid £ 3million for his services amid interest from @entity9 and @entity10			1
with more first - team football and international honours that figure could soon rise			2
how will he fit in ? it is highly likely @entity21 will go on loan to a team on the continent to continue his development before returning to @entity99 next summer			2
ultimately , he would play in a midfield duo behind three more advanced players – such as @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity105 – but possesses enough versatility to move upfield too			0
everyone has a weakness ... not a weakness on the pitch as such , but in 2012 he missed half a season after being diagnosed with a @entity113 infection , which can result in boils or abscesses			0
he recuperated after treatement and a lengthy spell on the sidelines			0
idol : @entity21 says his favourite player is @entity1 legend @entity82 , who left the club this summer what happens next ? @entity21 has joined in first - team training at @entity1 ’s @entity31 base but is likely to go on loan , possibly in the next fortnight to a team such as @entity127 or @entity128 , who have registered prior interest			1
‘ @entity21 has grown at @entity6 , ’ said @entity131 after his scouting trip			0
‘ in the summer he has to go to a club where he will continue to evolve in order to one day play at @entity99			0
’ in april his agent , @entity136 , said there were , ‘ several interested clubs from @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , and it is possible that the first two weeks of preparation activity will be with @entity1			2
but the decision is @entity8 ’s			0
’ anything else i need to know ? despite playing for @entity2 at numerous age groups , @entity21 was actually born in @entity148 , @entity140 .			0

@entity1 snapped up the 19 - year - old with @entity9 and @entity10 also keen
young midfielder has been likened to @entity71
@entity1 's *riches* in midfield mean he will probably go on loan this season
@entity49 has been keeping an eye on him for a while
