leading human rights lawyer to review judgement on the peers who were given lengthy bans from @entity4 by @entity5 last updated at 12:33 pm on 21st november 2011 @entity6 : she claimed more than £ 100,000 between 2005 and 2010 and was apparently reduced to tears by questioning three @entity9 peers given lengthy bans from @entity4 after wrongly claiming almost £ 200,000 in expenses are at the centre of an extraordinary legal battle over whether they were targeted because of their race			1
the sanctions against @entity6 , lord @entity18 , and @entity19 were the most draconian against misbehaving peers in 300 years			1
but now @entity22 peer lord @entity21 has hired leading human rights lawyer @entity23 to review the damning judgment on the peers by the @entity26			1
at least one of the three – lord @entity18 – admitted he had ‘ grave reservations ’ about the disciplinary process used to punish him			1
asked if he thought he had been the victim of racism , he said last night : ‘ i am very unhappy with the way i was treated but am not willing to comment any further			1
’ the suspensions , ordered last october , were the longest for the @entity34 since the 17th century			1
they were prompted by a series of revelations made by peers at the time of the @entity40 ’ expenses scandal and led to a string of internal disciplinary probes			1
lord @entity21 , who created @entity45 ’s @entity44 , was made a peer by @entity47 in 1998 at the age of 34			1
he said : ‘ something is not right about the way these three peers were treated			1
there were at least 12 members of the @entity54 who were accused of abusing their second home allowances			1
yet only these three were singled out to be disciplined			1
‘ all three are @entity9			1
it does not look right			2
at one point , when @entity6 was before the sub-committee she was reduced to tears by the questioning			2
‘ she excused herself , and went to the lavatory , but within three minutes they were bashing on the door demanding she come out			2
’ suspended : @entity19 , left and @entity18 , right , were given lengthy bans from @entity4 for wrongly claiming tens of thousands of pounds in expenses the @entity22 peer @entity70 of @entity72 also breached the rules governing the second homes allowance			1
but after he repaid £ 9,190 he was ordered to apologise in the @entity26 chamber and was not suspended			2
lord @entity21 , a multi-millionaire who gave up investment banking to set up @entity77 broadcasting company in the 1990s with @entity79 , said : ‘ i felt i had no choice but to ask @entity23 to conduct an independent review			1
’ lord @entity21 will pay mr @entity23 ’s fees but – whatever his conclusions – the @entity54 will not be bound to react to them			2
members of the sub-committee of the conduct committee included @entity88 , a former @entity22 lord chancellor , lady @entity89 , the former head of @entity91 , and @entity92 who for 25 years was head of the @entity94			2
@entity6 claimed expenses by stating that her main residence was a small flat in @entity98 , @entity99 , pictured above the intervention of lord @entity21 has appalled many of his colleagues			2
lord @entity103 , the @entity104 , said in a letter to lord @entity21 : ‘ i regret that you have felt it necessary to pursue this route particularly in the light of assurances from @entity89 and @entity92			0
‘ in particular , i reject any suggestion that race played a role in the deliberations of the relevant committees and @entity34 officials			0
’ @entity117 - born @entity92 , a former president of the @entity118 , said : ‘ i have spent almost 30 years in the race relations industry			0
it is unthinkable i would be involved in anything that smacks of racism			0
’ @entity6 's actual family home ( pictured ) in @entity124 , east @entity125 lord @entity126 and @entity127 , who were @entity129 peers , were jailed earlier this year for 12 months and nine months respectively for fiddling their second home allowances after a police investigation			1
they are suspended from the @entity34 until may			0
@entity6 claimed more than £ 100,000 between 2005 and 2010 by stating that her main residence was a small flat in @entity98 , @entity99 , rather than her family home in @entity125			0
she was suspended for 18 months and ordered to repay £ 125,000 in second home allowances			0
lord @entity19 had claimed £ 27,446 on the basis that his main home was a small flat occupied by his brother in @entity141 , @entity142 , even though he and his wife were listed on the electoral roll at their long - standing address in @entity147 , @entity148			0
he was sidelined for eight months , has repaid more than £ 27,000 and resumed his seat			0
lord @entity18 , one of @entity151 ’s richest men , lived in @entity125 but designated a one - bedroom flat in an @entity154 hotel that he owned as his main home			0
he was suspended for four months and has returned £ 41,982			0
all three also claimed travel expenses			0
@entity6 and @entity19 were found by the conduct committee to have acted ‘ not in good faith ’ by incorrectly declaring their main homes to claim overnight allowances			0
an initial investigation reached the same conclusion about @entity18			0
however , on appeal the committee accepted that although ‘ utterly unreasonable ’ and negligent , he had not been dishonest			0
neither @entity19 or @entity6 were willing to comment .			0
