a skeleton excavated from a grave in @entity2 has reignited the intense debate raging over whether the explorer @entity5 and his crew introduced syphilis to @entity8 in the 15th century			1
a new study claims to have disproved the theory , instead suggesting the sexually transmitted disease , which can result in death , was present in @entity8 before the explorers returned from the @entity14			1
the disease , which is caused by the bacteria , treponema pallidum , causes symptoms ranging from a sore throat and rash to problems with the heart , blood vessels and brain which can trigger stroke , heart disease , dementia , paralysis and even death			2
ever since the first case was recorded in @entity8 in 1495 - three years after @entity5 's first voyage to the @entity32 - experts have argued over its origins			1
three core theories exist attempting to explain where it first emerged , and its rapid spread through @entity8 at the end of the 15th century			1
experts have long debated the origin of syphilis			2
a popular theory is that the disease originated in the @entity32 , the @entity14 , and was transported to @entity8 by the explorer @entity5 and his crew the sexually transmitted disease causes symptoms ranging from a sore throat and rash to problems with the brain , heart and blood vessels that can trigger stroke , heart disease , paralysis and even death scientists at the @entity57 in @entity2 claim to have unearthed a skeleton of a man showing signs of syphilis dating from a @entity63 grave			1
they claim the bent thigh bone , pictured , is proof of the disease the first , the @entity68 theory , assumes syphilis was introduced to @entity8 in 1493 by a ship arriving from the @entity72 islands			1
the second suggests the disease was first present in @entity76 , and was brought to @entity8 by slaves arriving in @entity78 and @entity79			1
and , the third theory assumes syphilis was present in both the old and new worlds , and that four different syndromes developed			1
despite this abundance of theories , the definitive origin of the disease remains an enigma			2
a team of scientists from the @entity57 in @entity2 set out to test the three theories , examining the remains of people unearthed from the @entity94 area of @entity2 , ranging from different historical periods			1
they conclude ' the @entity68 theory of syphilis origin is not sustainable ' , citing evidence of syphilis on the bones of a man , aged 20 to 29 , who was excavated from a grave dating from the @entity63 era			1
dr @entity107 , a reader in evolutionary ecology at @entity109 in @entity110 , said one skeleton ' showing apparent syphilitic changes does not constitute much in the way of a weight of evidence ' to disprove the @entity68 theory			1
he told @entity117 : ' firstly , it is only a single skeleton - this means that it is very hard to draw much in the way of conclusions from it , because apparent syphilitic changes in a single skeleton could be the consequence of chance deformities that were not a consequence of the disease			2
' with only a single skeleton it is very hard to conclude much about the potential causes of the changes observed			2
' secondly , we know that there were other treponenmal diseases in @entity8 or @entity76 before @entity5 , such as @entity137 , and these can cause skeletal changes as well			1
the disease can cause major changes to bones ' without a decent sized sample , my understanding is that it is hard to distinguish syphilitic changes in bones from changes caused by other treponema diseases			2
' he said this discovery is the latest in a series of @entity153 skeletons with ' apparent syphilitic changes ' , with a similar study emerging ' every few years '			1
' these are always isolated skeletons with questionable pathology , ' he told @entity117			0
' and they always seem to get forgotten about pretty quickly			0
' dr @entity159 , a professor of medicine at the @entity161 and expert in the origins of diseases like syphilis , echoed dr @entity107 's doubts			2
professor @entity159 told @entity117 while the subject is ' important and pertinent today , the article is not valid '			0
he said the bone abnormalities appear to be the result of abnormal growth rather than syphilis			0
he said the thinning of the cortex of the femur , seen on the x-ray , is ' the opposite of what one sees in syphillis ' , rather suggesting the man suffered fibrous dysplasia			0
he told @entity117 : ' syphilis is clearly a @entity32 ' product '			0
' despite many efforts to suggest otherwise , there is no @entity188 evidence of syphilis prior to 1492			1
' the disease derives from @entity137 in @entity191 between 2000 and 1800 years ago , on the @entity192 above the @entity193			0
' the suggestions of @entity153 syphilis in @entity8 are based on inadequate understanding of terminology			1
' the new study was published in the @entity199 and involved @entity2 scientists analysing a random sample of 403 skeletons , from a collection of 3,000			1
of those , 135 came from five excavation sites archeologically dated to the @entity206 , the prehistory era			2
an antique sample of 134 skeletons were taken from more than 1,000 graves excavated from @entity210 or @entity211 , a @entity63 colony			1
the remaining 134 samples dated from the medieval and new age eras , and were taken from two excavation sites dating from 14th to 19th centuries			0
the oldest skeletons , from the prehistory and antique eras , were used as a control group			0
the scientists claim their finding disproves the theory that @entity5 transported the disease to @entity8 aboard the @entity226 and other ships the disease is a bacterial infection , often caught by having sex with an infected person			1
the bacteria that cause syphilis are called treponema pallidum			0
they can enter the body through close contact with an infected sore , normally during vaginal , anal or oral sex			0
the disease can also be caught by sharing sex toys with someone who is infected			0
pregnant women can pass the disease to their unborn child , which can cause stillbirth or death shortly after labour			0
@entity248 is caused by bacteria called treponema pallidum , which can enter the body through close contact with an infected sore , normally during vaginal , anal and oral sex in some cases the disease is passed through injecting drugs with infected needles			0
symptoms of syphilis develop in three stages			0
it begins with a painless but highly infectious sore on the genitals , or around the mouth			0
if another person comes into contact with the sore , which lasts from two to six weeks , they can become infected			0
secondary symptoms of the disease include a skin rash and sore throat , which typically last for a few weeks			0
once they disappear a sufferer will experience a phase with no symptoms , which can last for years			0
the next stage , the most dangerous , follows			0
the symptoms of the final stage vary depending on which part of the body the infection spreads to			0
it can affect the brain , nerves , eyes , heart , bones , skin or blood vessels , causing a range of illnesses including stroke , dementia , paralysis , blindess , deafness , heart disease and death			0
source : @entity298 given the most accepted theory , the @entity68 theory , supports the fact syphilitic changes will only be found on skeletons dating from the 15th century or later , this group were studied to assess if any signs of spyhilis could be found prior to @entity5 ' return to @entity8			1
prior to this study , only one case of venereal syphilis was found on a female skeleton from the 15th to 17th century			1
the team 's findings revealed just one skeleton had anomalies that suggested infection with syphilis			1
it dated from the antique excavation site in @entity210 , and the scientists concluded it belonged to a man aged between 20 and 29 years old			2
changes to the femur , or thigh bone , found suggest the man had fallen victim to the disease			0
the authors conclude : ' because of everything stated , we believe that the @entity68 theroy of syphilis origin is not sustainable			2
' @entity332 was most likely to present in the old world , but not to the extent that is was in @entity336 time			0
dr @entity107 , from @entity109 in @entity110 said one skeleton is not enough to disprove the @entity68 theory ' it is interesting and indicative that no evidence of syphilis was found in graveyards from @entity336 time in this research , and in the territory of present - day @entity2 , only few cases of probable syphilis were published			1
' all evidence supports the theory that syphilis is not a new illness , but its manifestations were randomly recorded or misclassified			2
' they said they believe ' more excavations with more skeletons examined will support the syphilis prior to 1492 '			2
dr @entity107 challenged those scientists who back the theory that syphilis pre-dates @entity5 ' return to @entity8 to produce a molecular family tree for the bacteria , which is better than those currently used to show syphilis is more closely related to @entity366 , than @entity32			1
' or they should find a skeletal assemblage with a decent sample size of apparently syphilitic changes that would allow a better assessment of whether the changes observed were really caused by syphilis			0
' or they should sequence dna from pre-columbian bacteria and use the sequence to show that the bacteria in question were the causative agents of syphilis , and not a related treponema			0
' they also need to come up with an explanation of why the disease changed in virulence and went from being unknown in 1490 to a dreadful and widely recognised scourge a few years later			2
' he told @entity117 : ' there is considerable evidence that venereal syphilis evolved in the @entity32 and was then transported to @entity8 shortly after @entity5 ' discoveries in 1492			1
' this evidence includes dna sequencing studies that show that the bacterium which causes syphilis is most closely related to other , similar diseases in the @entity32 , skeletal evidence showing syphilitic changes in large numbers of @entity153 skeletons in places like the @entity402 , and also the rather more circumstantial evidence regarding the changes in virulence caused by syphilis after it first appeared in @entity8			1
' for the moment the only good explanation for this change in virulence is that the disease was freshly introduced from a different population where it had been evolving to deal with defences possessed by the host population , which the @entity8 population did not have , allowing the disease to largely avoid any immune response for the @entity8 hosts and cause very severe disease			1

scientists at the @entity57 , @entity2 , claim to have ' disproved ' the theory syphilis was introduced to @entity8 by @entity5
origins of the infection is one of the most *controversial* issues of disease
three major theories exist , the first is the @entity68 explanation
the second suggests *african* slaves brought it to @entity78 and @entity79
and the third assumes syphilis was present in both @entity188 and @entity441
new study examined 403 skeletons for signs of syphilis
identified one male skeleton they claim had signs of the disease
because it dated from the @entity63 era , they say @entity68 theory is *wrong*
experts dismissed the discovery , claiming one skeleton is not proof
