by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 03:42 est , 7 march 2014 scientists have developed a breath test to check for breast cancer			1
research shows the kit is at least as accurate as breast x-rays routinely used in hospitals			2
it takes less than ten minutes to detect the disease and its makers say it may reduce the need for uncomfortable mammograms			0
by taking the embarrassment out of the procedure , it could also lead to more woman coming forward for testing , saving lives			1
breakthrough : scientists have developed a breath test for breast cancer ( file picture ) it would also mean that women are n’t exposed to radiation during testing			1
breast cancer is @entity31 ’s most common cancer , with almost 50,000 women diagnosed a year			1
it is the second biggest cancer killer among women after lung cancer , claiming almost 1,000 lives a month			2
however , the number of women who have three - yearly mammograms is falling , amid concerns that the breast x-rays can not distinguish dangerous cancers from ones that grow too slowly to ever cause harm			2
the @entity46 kit is being developed by a @entity48 firm and is already on sale in @entity50			1
it begins with a woman breathing for two minutes into a breathalyser			2
the air is fed into a machine which analyses the levels of chemicals			0
the results are crunched by a computer , which determines whether the chemical pattern is a sign of breast cancer			1
research published in the journal @entity65 shows it to be at least as accurate as mammograms			0
@entity68 , a professor of medicine at @entity70 , and the brains behind the breath test , said : ‘ we know that if you get a negative result on the breast test , there is a better than 99.9 per cent chance that a woman does n’t have breast cancer			1
makers of the new test say it may reduce the need for uncomfortable mammograms ‘ that is the key thing , because in any screening programme , the overwhelming majority of women who come in off the street do not have breast cancer			1
‘ eventually , the physician and the woman might decide that she does n’t need to go on to have a mammogram			2
’ this means , the vast majority of women may not need to undergo the trauma of a mammogram			2
the accuracy for actually spotting the disease is lower and so women who have a positive breath test will still need a mammogram			0
the test , which is being developed by @entity104 ’ firm @entity103 , is already on sale in @entity50			1
however , dr @entity68 stresses that bigger studies are needed before it becomes the first choice for breast cancer screening			1
he added : ‘ i am optimistic that in years to come , people will start to look at a breath tests as a global test			0
‘ something that can be used to screen for many different diseases – different cancers and different infections			0
‘ eventually , breath testing will become as mainstream as blood tests and urine tests			0
’ @entity31 experts described the research as exciting but early days			0
@entity122 , of @entity123 , said : ‘ this is a small pilot study for an interesting idea			0
‘ but much more research is needed before we know if this test could be considered safe alongside breast screening			0
‘ women should get to know their bodies , and if they notice any unusual changes they should have it checked out by their doctor			0

@entity46 is being developed by @entity48 firm and is already on sale in @entity50
it is hoped it will lead to more woman coming forward for testing
almost 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year
