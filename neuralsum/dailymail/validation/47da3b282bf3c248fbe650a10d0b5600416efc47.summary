@entity1 head coach @entity0 says that prop @entity4 's @entity3 prospects are ' 50 - 50 ' after he was injured during last saturday 's @entity7 victory over @entity8			1
@entity0 has confirmed that @entity4 , who was carried off just 14 minutes into the @entity8 game , suffered a full rupture of his achilles			2
@entity12 prop @entity13 will replace him for next saturday 's @entity7 appointment with @entity15 in @entity16 , with loosehead @entity17 taking over from @entity18 , who has a hamstring problem			1
@entity0 said : ' we were hoping he ( @entity4 ) was going to have surgery on monday , but there was too much swelling , and it has been put back a week			0
@entity1 will be missing props @entity18 and @entity4 when they take on @entity15 in @entity16 on saturday ' he is a 50 - 50 chance for the @entity3 , but we are confident he has enough time to get back and be available for the @entity3			1
' if things go well , he will not be far away			0
' @entity17 and @entity13 will line up against @entity15 , while there are call - ups on the bench for hooker @entity31 , props @entity32 and @entity33 and scrum - half @entity34 , with @entity36 missing out			1
@entity37 features among the substitutes instead of @entity40 hooker @entity39 , who had been following return - to - play protocols after taking a blow to his head during the @entity8 game			2
@entity45 , meanwhile , gains a match - day place after only joining the squad for training on monday , while @entity34 - a livewire operator and consistent try - scorer for the @entity51 - gets his chance instead of the hugely - experienced @entity36			2
@entity1 dash @entity8 's @entity53 hopes - highlights @entity17 of @entity51 ( right ) replaces @entity18 in the squad that travels to the @entity57 on saturday in terms of the starting line - up , it will be @entity17 ' full @entity1 debut after he went on as a replacement for @entity18 at half - time last saturday , with @entity13 continuing instead of @entity4			1
@entity1 will head to the @entity57 lying third in the @entity7 table behind @entity64 and @entity8 on points difference			0
a comprehensive victory over @entity15 , though , would turn up the heat on their title rivals , with @entity8 tackling @entity69 at @entity70 next saturday , followed by @entity64 hosting @entity71 at @entity72			0
ospreys prop @entity13 has also been called up as a replacement as @entity1 look to win the @entity7 @entity0 added : ' it was great to get the result we wanted in front of our home supporters last weekend and to give us a chance going into the last round of action			0
' obviously , it 's disappointing for @entity18 and @entity4 , but @entity17 and @entity13 stepped up well last weekend and we expect the same on saturday			1
' the challenge to us is to go to @entity15 and win , and try to win by a significant margin , but we know that 's an extremely tough ask and the first job will be to simply get the result			0
@entity18 ( right ) joins @entity1 team - mate @entity13 in tackling @entity8 's @entity88 on saturday ' @entity15 build their confidence around the scrum and lineout drive , and that is an area we are going to have to compete strongly in at the start of the match			1
' wales have won five of their previous seven @entity7 visits to @entity16 , highlighted by a 38 - 8 victory in 2005			0
and they are going to need something similar - if not better - if they are to realistically have a chance of securing their third @entity7 title in four years .			0
