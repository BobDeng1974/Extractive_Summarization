@entity1 sen. @entity0 , a @entity2 running in a tight re-election race , asked for a do - over during a tv interview on friday night when he could n't come up with the names of the three most influential books he 'd ever read			1
' oh wow , ' he said			0
' that 's the toughest – the , uh , three most influential books in my life – ' gathering his composure during taping of a ' news extra ' filmed for the website of @entity16 in @entity17 , he came up with one			1
the , um , uh –			0
' after a three - second pregnant pause , the stumped senator asked for another chance			1
fellow debater @entity47 rescued him minutes later			0
@entity0 's interviewer , @entity49 , tried unsuccessfully to help the senator by moving on to a question about music			1
' well , let 's go back to that			0
what about – what about music ? what 's the last song you listened to ? ' @entity0 came up empty			1
' um , i 'm brain dead today , he admitted			1
' the questions came at the tail end of a recurring two - minute segment in which @entity49 asks politicians 10 yes - or - no questions about pressing issues like the death penalty , gun control and immigration reform			0
a newsroom source at @entity16 told @entity73 that the embarrassing interview was aired live			0
but @entity75 , the station 's new media director , later said it was taped ' for web only , ' unlike longer 7 - minute segments with the candidates that aired on tv			2
still , the thumbs - up , thumbs - down options on serious political topics were n't available to @entity0 in the softball bonus round			1
ultimately , @entity49 gave him his do - over			2
' uh , let me catch my thought , ' the senator responded			0
adding to the @entity92 book , he cited ' in the @entity93 , ' a book about a ship 's doomed 1881 polar voyage ; and ' @entity97 , ' a novel that traces the history of the northeast @entity1 plains and became a tv miniseries in 1978			2
' oops ! ' : during a nov. 2011 presidential primary debate , @entity42 gov. @entity41 could n't name the three federal government agencies he had promised to close if he won the presidency @entity0 never named the last song he had listened to , but gave high marks to ' @entity107 ' – even if he could n't name the song 's title			1
' i love @entity112 's song about avalanches , ' he said , ' because it 's appropriate to @entity1			2
' @entity0 has little hope of an avalanche re-election victory on nov. 4			0
pollsters put his race against @entity38 rep. @entity38 within their margin of error			0
the @entity122 average of recent polls gives @entity38 a 3 percentage point lead , but @entity0 was up by the same margin just two weeks ago .			2

@entity128 sen. @entity0 was asked to name the three most influential books in his life , and could only come up with one
in *mid-freeze* , he asked a tv interviewer if he could 're - tape ' his answer
@entity0 admitted ' i 'm brain dead today ' when he could n't think of the last song he had listened to
moment was reminiscent of @entity42 gov. @entity41 's *famed* ' oops ' moment in 2011 when he could n't name all 3 federal agencies he *wanted* to *abolish*
ultimately @entity0 came up with the answers , but only after the interviewer gave him another chance
