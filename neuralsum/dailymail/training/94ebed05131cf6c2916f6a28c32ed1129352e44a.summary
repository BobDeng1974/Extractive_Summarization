by @entity0 universities would have to apply new aptitude tests and cut the number of drop - outs in plans for a shake - up of the student loans system			1
amid concerns about the long - term viability of the funding system for higher education , senior conservatives are considering reforms that would reduce its cost and crack down on poor quality degrees			2
they include a new minimum qualification for students who qualify for taxpayer - backed loans and an end to the right to charge fees at institutions which see large numbers of students fail to finish courses or find well - paid jobs			1
future : new plans include an end to the right to charge fees at institutions which see large numbers of students fail to finish courses or find well - paid jobs chancellor @entity34 has announced that the government is abolish the cap on student numbers in 2015 , increasing the cost of taxpayer subsidies to the sector by around £ 700 million a year			1
‘ with @entity34 announcing no controls on student numbers , there are fantastic opportunities			1
wanting your kid to go to university is an aspiration to join the middle class , ’ said a @entity35 source			0
‘ the graduate repayment scheme is a perfectly solid way of financing graduate education			0
however , we may need some kind of quality control , because universities will be able to recruit without the old framework on number controls			0
so there ’s a legitimate question about what would happen if a university was signing up lots of people who could n’t get through a course and were then dropping out			0
’ under the tuition fees regime brought in by the coalition , universities can charge fees of up to £ 9,000 a year			1
students start paying back loans which cover them once they are earning over £ 21,000 at a rate of nine per cent of their salary above £ 15,000			1
any debt still owing after 30 years is automatically cancelled by the government			0
@entity78 , @entity79 ’s former policy chief , who is now at @entity80 , has drawn up detailed plans for reform			0
plans : universities would have to apply new aptitude tests and cut the number of drop - outs in plans for a shake - up of the student loans system he said there were too many ‘ sub-prime loans ’ being made to students doing courses with ‘ unsatisfactory completion rates , [ which ] offer limited chances of graduate level employment and cost students more than they gain financially ’			1
he said that when the new loans system was brought in , the government estimated that 35 per cent of money lent would not be repaid			2
but recently , the @entity103 has suggested this is likely to be at least 50 per cent			0
forecasts suggest there will be more graduates on low to modest salaries , who will not start paying anything back , while the @entity110 is struggling to get payments from those freelancing or in short - term jobs , as well as from @entity114 students overseas			2
‘ on top of this level of non-payment , there are substantial subsidies for the poorest students who receive maintenance grants and for higher cost courses , ’ mr @entity78 said			2
‘ all in all , it means that the taxpayer will be paying more for university education than it did before the loans were introduced			2
limit : chancellor @entity34 has announced that the government is abolish the cap on student numbers in 2015 , increasing the cost of taxpayer subsidies to the sector by around £ 700 million a year in these terms , it is hard to believe how much political capital has been spent on the loans controversy			1
armed with these facts , i suspect that political history will label the introduction of student loans as one of the presentational failures of the century			2
’ he said ‘ lines in the sand ’ now needed to be drawn about which universities should be attended and which courses followed ‘ to protect students and taxpayers from wasting time , effort and money ’			0
‘ one way of doing this would be to say that universities will only be accredited for student loans if they achieve a range of minimum standards , ’ he added			1
he suggested that a maximum drop - out rate of 20 per cent , disqualifying 20 out of 121 @entity163 universities , and a requirement that 60 per cent of students should get a professional or graduate level job , a test failed by a third of universities			2
he also proposed a new entry qualification of 300 @entity171 points - or three bs at @entity173 - and an expectation that 60 per cent of students should end up with a first class or a 2:1 degree			1
the @entity35 source said a ‘ three @entity180 ’ requirement would exclude people who left school early and wanted to attend university as a mature student , meaning an ‘ aptitude test ’ was more likely			0
‘ this is the start of manifesto work			0
we will look with interest at what @entity78 says , ’ the source added			0
‘ the forecasts on repayments are incredibly sensitive to earnings forecasts and they are going to keep on bouncing around			0
’ concern : deputy prime minister @entity195 warned @entity197 's proposals to cut tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year would favour wealthy students rather than the less well - off the source said a small increase in the £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fee charge was also possible , adding : ‘ we have been freezing it in cash terms			1
that is n’t a long - term viable option , but that does n’t mean some great big increase			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity195 warned @entity197 ’s proposals to cut tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year would favour wealthy students rather than the less well - off			1
mr @entity195 said : ‘ when they first announced this it was shown by independent commentators that a £ 6,000 limit would benefit the very richest students who could pay upfront and would not help at all the very poorest			0
’ tories say a £ 6,000 a year cap on fees would mean a £ 3 billion - a - year black hole in university funding and point out students repay significantly less every month than they did under the last @entity35 ’s loans regime .			1

includes minimum qualification for students with taxpayer - backed loans
would end right to charge fees at institutions where large numbers fail
@entity34 will abolish cap on student numbers in 2015
