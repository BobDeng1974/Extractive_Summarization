@entity0 has vowed to make @entity1 stronger after accepting @entity2 had to go			1
the @entity1 manager signalled @entity2 ’s departure after @entity5 agreed to pay the striker ’s £ 75million buy - out clause and he will be unveiled next week close to the @entity8 following a medical			1
@entity2 , last season ’s @entity11 top scorer and winner of the @entity14 and @entity15 ’ @entity17 awards , pleaded for understanding from @entity1 fans who idolised the @entity20 but who had also grown increasingly exasperated at the controversy he courted throughout his three - and - a - half - year stay			1
@entity0 , who stood by @entity2 after he bit @entity60 ’s @entity59 last year , said : ‘ the club have done all they can over a sustained period of time to try to keep @entity2 at @entity1			1
‘ it is with great reluctance and following lengthy discussions we have eventually agreed to his wishes to move to @entity70 for new experiences and challenges			0
’ @entity0 faces the task of replacing a player who scored 31 goals last season and led @entity1 to the brink of the @entity11 title			1
@entity80 striker @entity79 and @entity82 ’s @entity81 are his early targets			0
but @entity0 promised : ‘ i am confident we will improve the team further and will be stronger for this coming season			1
if there is one thing the history of this great club teaches us , it is that @entity1 is bigger than any individual			2
i hope our supporters continue to dream and believe that we are moving forward and with continued improvement and progression , together we will bring the success we all crave and deserve			0
’ cheeky : @entity98 ( front ) tries to score a backheel past @entity101 ( right ) pushing themselves : @entity103 and fellow midfielder @entity104 have a tussle at @entity106 putting it in : @entity103 ( left ) keeps tabs on new signing @entity110 during @entity1 training on friday eye on the ball : @entity51 keeps his focus as he dribbles during a training drill getting on with it : @entity34 ( left ) passes the ball and @entity32 and @entity49 ( right ) tussle @entity2 , who will sign a five - year deal worth around £ 200,000 a week , said he was leaving with a heavy heart			1
in a statement he added : ‘ i hope you can all understand why i have made this decision			0
this club did all they could to get me to stay but playing and living in @entity70 , where my wife ’s family live , is a lifelong dream and ambition			2
i believe now the timing is right			0
‘ it is with a heavy heart that i leave @entity1 for a new life and new challenges in @entity70			2
both me and my family have fallen in love with this club and with the city but most of all i have fallen in love with the incredible fans			0
‘ you have always supported me and we , as a family , will never forget it , we will always be @entity1 supporters			1
i am very proud i have played my part in helping to return @entity1 to the elite of the @entity11 and in particular back into the @entity144			2
‘ thank you again for some great moments and memories			0
’ stat attack : the impact @entity2 made at @entity1 was formidable the deal will be the third biggest in football history after @entity153 ’s £ 86m move from @entity154 to @entity155 and @entity157 ’s £ 80m transfer from @entity158 to @entity155 in 2009			1
there were fears @entity5 would try to negotiate a lower fee due to the player ’s indiscretions but @entity1 ’s owners @entity164 were prepared to resist all offers below the buy - out clause , which was inserted for foreign clubs during contract renegotiations last december			1
@entity1 made it clear in the first meeting with @entity5 that they did not wish to endure a saga similar to the one that followed @entity176 ’s bid for @entity2 last summer			1
the only negotiation remained the structure of the payment particularly once it became clear that @entity180 did not wish to be part of the transfer			0
@entity2 is now facing a fight to appeal his four - month ban , described by his lawyer as ‘ draconian , totalitarian and fascist ’ with an appeal going to the @entity187			2
the ban prohibits @entity2 from attending football matches , training with @entity190 or his club and attending functions organised by his team — a penalty now borne by @entity5			2
maybe he has a point : this graphic shows @entity1 have a better win percentage without @entity2 than they do with him ( although they have , of course , played far fewer matches ) ( source @entity200 ) @entity202 appeal rejected @entity2 ’s lawyer @entity203 said : ‘ we hope they revoke this sanction that is blatantly draconian , totalitarian and fascist			1
the right of a footballer to work is being violated , and football should be worried about that			0
the nine international games may seem excessive , but the fact that he ca n’t watch a game of football , or train or carry out his job , we are talking about unpleasant things			0
‘ @entity2 recognised his error but we ’ve seen that for @entity221 saying sorry is not an important factor , ’ added @entity203			0
‘ justice will take its time but it will come			0
we knew that @entity221 would uphold the ban because they are corporatists			0
we will not stop , we are going to go to the @entity187 and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available to us			0
’ for @entity1 , @entity2 is no longer their problem .			1

@entity0 says @entity2 is a ' special talent ' and thanked him for his efforts
the @entity20 has ' improved as a player ' at @entity235
@entity1 ' have done all they can ' to try to get @entity2 to stay
' we will be stronger for the coming season , ' *insists* @entity0
@entity1 wish @entity2 ' and his young family well '
