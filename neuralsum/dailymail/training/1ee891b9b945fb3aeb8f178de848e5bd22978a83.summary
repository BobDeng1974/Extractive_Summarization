by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 22:53 est , 18 november 2013 courting controversy : @entity3 junior @entity2 is chairman of the school 's @entity4 and intends to hold a mock ' catch an illegal immigrant ' game on campus a @entity11 university conservative student group announced monday their plans to hold a ‘ catch an @entity18 ’ game where winners will receive $ 25 gift certificates for nabbing players marked as undocumented			1
@entity2 , chairman of @entity3 ’s @entity4 says he came up with the idea simply as a means to ‘ spark discussion ’ on the issue of immigration reform , but admits his group is n’t above courting controversy			1
now that news of his group ’s unseemly plan has spread , the former senator @entity31 campaigner and his club have gotten a huge response , but not much of it has been positive			1
‘ if we held a forum or a public debate no one would show up , ’ @entity2 told the @entity35			2
‘ but if we have an event like this it gets people talking about and if it gets people talking about it then we 've succeeded			0
’ if success is measured in angry tweets , @entity46 comments , and unflattering media portrayals of their chairman , then @entity2 and the @entity4 of @entity3 have certainly succeeded			1
no sooner had the event been announced then internet sleuths and progressive groups took the opportunity to pin @entity2 — who many social media commenters have identified as @entity58 — his group , and its plans onto @entity61 politicians			1
pointless exercise ? the student group intends to mark volunteers as ' illegal ' and then give students who ' catch ' them $ 25 gift certificates all hail the @entity68 : the group , seen here holding up the @entity71 sign , not the sign of the devil , says the game is a way to open discussion about immigration but critics say it 's blatantly racist and offensive specifically , the publicity around the catch an illegal immigrant event led to the revelation that @entity2 had previously done paid campaigning for @entity11 attorney general and gubernatorial candidate @entity85			1
he ’d also had stints as an intern for the @entity11 statehouse and @entity89 favorite senator @entity31			1
the @entity85 campaign immediately distanced themselves from the growing controversy			2
@entity92 in training : angry progressive groups and internet sleuths quickly revealed that the @entity97 chairman was once a paid campaigner for @entity11 gubernatorial candidate @entity98 ( right ) and an intern at the @entity11 statehouse and for senator @entity31 's re-election campaign ( left )			1
@entity104 campaign has since distanced itself from @entity2 and the event ‘ our campaign has no affiliation with this repugnant effort , ’ @entity85 ’s press secretary @entity106 said in a release			1
history of controversy : the @entity114 held a bake sale with this sign in september , writing ' if you agree with this , you agree with how the university is admitting students			2
' but the administration called it ' demeaning ' meanwhile , social media attacks on @entity2 and his game continued			0
‘ would n't it be awesome if i made a website with all these pictures and names of people participating in this event for future employers to see , ’ wrote @entity46 user @entity125 along with a screenshot of the guests who ’ve opted to attend the event on a @entity46 events page			0
most commenters stuck to calling the event racist and offensive			0
the @entity114 have garnered similar ire before			0
the group held a bake sale in september in which brownies were priced more cheaply for students of color and for women			2
in tweeting a picture of the price list , the group wrote : ‘ if you agree with this , you agree with how the university is admitting students			0
please listen to what we 're saying			0
’ the bake sale was later deemed ‘ inflammatory and demeaning ’ by @entity3 administrators			0
as for wednesday ’s event , @entity2 told the @entity35 he ’s none too concerned about critics or even potential protestors			2
‘ sticks and stones , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ we ’re not going to let anything like that stop us this time			0

the event will be held by the @entity4 of the @entity3
students marked with ' illegal immigrant ' labels will walk around campus on wednesday
any student who ' catches ' them and returns them to the club will receive a $ 25 gift card
' not *afraid* to be politically *incorrect* ' : the group is led by group chairman @entity2 , a former paid campaigner for @entity11 gubernatorial candidate @entity85 and intern for senator @entity31
