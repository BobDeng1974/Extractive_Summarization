getting your own place and moving out from @entity2 and @entity3 is every teenager ’s dream , but property savvy young @entity6 have worked out that it ’s much better financially to stick with their parents until they 're 30 if they want to buy their ideal home			1
today young people all over @entity6 are happy to live with their parents for as long as possible if it means they can afford to buy the property they want in the right area			1
@entity17 of @entity18 – the largest provider of property information , analytics and property - related risk management services in @entity6 and @entity24 – confirmed that many young adults and couples were prepared to stay at home until they were 30 and do things differently			1
young @entity6 are happy to stay at home with their parents before splashing out on a trendy pad ‘ what we ’re hearing from the mortgage brokers is that young people today are buying an investment home in an area they ’d like to live in , but for the first few years they 'll rent it out and let someone else pay for it , while they remain living at home , ’ @entity17 explained			1
‘ it means they are never priced out of that market and they can move when they can afford to			0
so what we ’re seeing from the mortgage brokers is that young couples are happy to buy an investment property but still live with @entity2 and @entity3			1
‘ kids are a lot smarter with their money than what we give them credit for today			0
it ’s a new trend to live at home until you ’re 30 because there ’s no stigma attached to it now			1
it ’s a sensible business decision			1
’ @entity2 and @entity3 could be seeing much more of their children in the future many couples are from @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 ancestry where living together as an extended family well into their 20s is traditional			0
but it also now makes a lot of financial sense			0
‘ @entity71 couples buy an investment property and let it tick over , then when they do get married they can move in themselves or sell it to get an even better property in that area , ’ @entity17 said			0
he argued that this new way of thinking caught some developers out in recent years			2
‘ developers were building dairy farms in the country into attractive housing lots when the kids looking for places just wanted to live in the city			1
for 10 years the developers got it wrong to an extent , because the lots were not being bought up as fast as developers thought they would be , ’ @entity17 said			2
a house in this row in @entity93 in @entity94 would appeal to many first - time home owners terraced houses like the ones here at @entity99 , @entity96 in @entity94 are much sought after he also believed that the change of thinking was as much cultural as anything else			2
decades ago @entity6 used to get married in their early 20s			1
their kids had grown up by the time they were in their 30s			0
they ’d live in the suburbs until the kids had flown the nest and then move back into the city			2
‘ that has all changed			0
@entity71 people today want to live in the city to start with and have babies later in life , ’ said @entity17			2
‘ they ’ll then bring their kids up in the early years in their city apartment			0
it ’s later on when the kids get older that they ’ll move out to the burbs where they can kick the football around			0
’ staying at home longer will help young people save more money to buy their ideal home @entity125 ’s quarterly review on the @entity6 residential property market and economy highlighted other reasons why this new phenomenon was taking place			1
at the moment first home buyers languish at near record low levels			2
in september first home buyers accounted for just 12 per cent of all financial housing commitments over the month			0
the main reason for this is because since early 2010 temporary first home buyer incentives were removed			0
over a 12 - month period to september 2014 there were 77,854 commitments by first home buyers which were just 12.5 per cent of all commitments and the lowest annual figure on record			0
houses like these overlooking @entity144 in @entity94 will not come cheaply it all means that the lack of affordable housing available for @entity6 first home buyers , particularly within the major capital cities , is what ’s likely to be contributing to the low number of first home buyers despite historically low mortgage rates			1
young @entity6 will stay at home first before making a bid on the house of their dreams the mortgage rates are at near record low levels , because interest rates are at extremely low levels			1
however , the trouble is that although mortgage rates are low and home values are increasing , household disposal incomes are hardly rising at all .			0

young @entity6 happy to live with parents until finding the right place
' it **'s** a new trend to live at home until you 're 30 , ' says real estate expert
no longer any stigma attached as it **'s** a sensible business decision
developers *misjudged* what young *homeowners* were looking for
