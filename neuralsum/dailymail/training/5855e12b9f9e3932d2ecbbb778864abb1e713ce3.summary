by @entity0 @entity1 says the attitude of local jobseekers is ' a disgrace ' a company boss who advertised 50 vacancies in a city with nearly 2,000 unemployed has branded local jobseekers ' lazy ' after nobody came forward			1
@entity1 , owner of recruitment agency @entity10 , urgently required unskilled workers for at least three months ' work at a local food factory			1
but when he posted an advert at the local @entity16 not a single person came forward in time for the start of the contract			1
mr @entity1 said the response was ' unbelievable ' and the attitude of local job - seekers was ' a disgrace '			1
recruitment boss mr @entity1 claims that many do not want to work and have no intention of taking menial jobs they are offered			1
he said : ' if i lost my job , i would have a job tomorrow , even if it was cleaning toilets			2
i do n't understand the mindset of these people			0
' mr @entity1 contacted @entity16 at about 12.20pm on october 9 seeking people for warehouse work at the local @entity36 food factory , which would last through the @entity38 period			1
the firm then followed up the call with an e-mail at 12.41pm with more details about the minimum - wage £ 6.31 - per - hour jobs			2
inductions for the monday - to - friday roles were due to begin at 5pm that day , before the shift			2
however , a job centre source said the problem was the ' very short timescale ' given to find people for a night shift			2
mr @entity1 , 29 , said : ' people need no skills whatsoever			1
new figures released last week revealed there are more jobseekers than available jobs in @entity59 , with 1,870 residents signed on ' it 's the most simple cake - packing , box - stacking position			2
my three - year - old daughter could do it			2
but not one person has rung me up			2
' it 's a disgrace			0
people who pay their taxes will be so disappointed in that			0
' there is work and it is beyond me why nobody has rung me			0
they could n't even get me one person			0
' i see so many people hanging around on street corners , people outside the job centre smoking and then something like this comes up where i need just 50 people old enough to work in a factory			1
' it 's beyond me that they ca n't even get one person from the job centre			1
it is so very frustrating			0
recruitment boss mr @entity1 claims that many do not want to work ' the only conditions are that they have to be over 18 and have a national insurance number and no criminal convictions			1
you do n't need any experience whatsoever			0
' mr @entity1 managed to get 10 people himself by using his contacts , records and by calling friends , claiming he had effectively had to act as a @entity100 himself to fill at least some of the positions			1
but one of those who considered the job hit back saying he had no choice because he is better off on benefits			1
@entity107 , 37 , says it is ' not worth the money ' because the take - home pay of £ 220 will leave him out of pocket			0
' i do want to work but what is the point of me going if it 's going to make me worse off ? ' he said			0
' i 'm not going to work for peanuts			0
' if the finances were right , i would have gone for the induction			0
i would have got a pushbike and gone up there but it was n't worth the money			0
' the @entity36 job would only earn him £ 200 to £ 220 per week after tax , less than he received on benefits , he said			1
a @entity129 spokesman said the short notice of the shifts meant staff were unable to fill the roles			0
' every day @entity135 staff up and down the country are successfully helping employers fill their vacancies and get people into work , ' he said			0
' on this occasion , however , the very short timescale given by the agency and the need for jobseekers to be available to work the night shift , that same day , meant we were unable to help on this occasion			1
' @entity149 , mp for @entity59 , said : ' it seems disappointing that there are n't people prepared to take those jobs			0
' you would have thought there would have been a reasonable amount of take - up given the number of people out of work			2

@entity1 , owner of a recruitment agency , needed unskilled workers
when he posted advert at local @entity16 not a single person came forward
but one job - seeker said the work would have earned him less than benefits
