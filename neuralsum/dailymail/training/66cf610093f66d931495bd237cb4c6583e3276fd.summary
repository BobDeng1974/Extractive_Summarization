by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 7 may 2013 questions are being asked after the fire - damaged wreck of an @entity4 biplane lost for almost a year was found just five miles from where it took off			1
the plane and its 13 passengers disappeared after going on an unauthorised ' joyride ' from @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , on june 11 last year			1
despite an extensive search lasting several months over an area the size of @entity17 , the wreckage remained undetected - although it apparently crashed just five miles from where it took off			1
lost no longer : the wreckage of the @entity22 - 2 ' ghost plane ' which lay undiscovered for almost a year after it disappeared carrying 13 passengers on an unauthorised flight from @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 two hunters came across the debris in a swamp at the end of last week , solving what @entity31 news agency dubbed ' one of the biggest modern mysteries in @entity12 ' , @entity29 reported			1
now relatives of those who died in the crash , who included senior police officials and their families , are asking questions as to why it has taken so long to locate the site of the tragedy			1
some believe there has been a conspiracy to cover up the truth			2
@entity49 , father of @entity50 , who was travelling aboard the plane with his wife @entity52 , told the @entity29 : ' they searched there last summer			2
all around was searched and nothing was found '			1
' last year 's hunt was conducted by elite @entity59 troops , it was claimed			1
and now - suddenly - everything was found			1
' and , most importantly , it was all on the surface , all the debris on the surface , all the bones on the surface , even though it was burning '			2
mr @entity50 claimed the crash site was staged to look like the scene of the tragedy and that there could be sinister circumstances behind the plane 's downing			2
' now this is what i think : they brought them here , and offloaded them , ' he said			2
' who else could have done it in such manner ? only the military			2
why do they need this ? just to hide it all			2
' i think someone shot them down			2
or , you know , around the same time , they launched from @entity93 the missile @entity95 , which did not reach its goal			2
so , there are a lot of assumptions			2
' mystery : now relatives of those who died in the crash , who included senior police officials and their families , are asking questions as to why it has taken so long to locate the site of the tragedy @entity111 , whose sister perished in the crash , said she was suspicious about the well - made video of the crash site			1
she said the weather in the video did not match the actual weather on the day the plane was supposed to have been found ; and while there is fire damage on the plane , the surrounding foliage is unharmed , she said			1
' i believe the plane was dragged to that place and burned			0
judging by the video , there are n't even dead trees around it			0
the area is completely untouched , although everything should have burned , ' she said			0
conspiracy : @entity49 , father of passenger @entity50 claimed the crash site was staged to look like the scene of the tragedy and that there could be sinister circumstances behind the plane 's downing rescue teams spent months scouring the area last year but were unable to find a trace of the an - 2 biplane , which set out without permission			1
up to 2,000 people and 14 aircraft were involved in the desperate five - month hunt for the an - 2 biplane over 275,000 square kilometres of rough terrain			0
policeman @entity150 told reporters at the time how the group had set off on their unscheduled flight at 11pm , after a drinking session			0
he said one theory was that they had intended ' to go fishing or to a bathhouse ' - steam saunas often found in remote parts of @entity12			1
the group included a pilot , @entity10 's chief traffic policeman , another officer , a security guard and the airfield 's night watchman – who was reportedly wearing slippers – along with some of the men 's relatives , including at least two women			0
the rescue operation was made all the more tricky because part of the region is hilly and covered in dense forest known as ' taiga '			0
at least 25 rescuers received potentially dangerous tick bites and one almost drowned in a swamp			0
the failure of the search led to wild speculation over the fate of the plane and its passengers - including , in echoes of the tv series @entity187 , that they had survived the crash and were fighting for their lives in the wilderness			1
the search area even included the notorious @entity194 pass in the northern @entity195 where a group of students perished in odd circumstances in 1959			0
when their bodies were found , two victims had cracked skulls , two had broken ribs and one had her tongue missing , although there were no signs of struggle at the scene			1
a @entity210 investigation concluded the team died as the result of ' a compelling unknown force '			0
chance encounter : two hunters came across the debris in a swamp at the end of last week , solving what @entity31 news agency dubbed ' one of the biggest modern mysteries in @entity12 ' the official explanation : officials say the plane was not found earlier because it is in an area of treacherous swampland that the two men who found it were only able to walk through because it was still frozen however , not all of the relatives of those lost in last year 's @entity22 crash believe there was foul play at work - supernatural or otherwise			1
@entity235 , whose relative was aboard the plane , said in the thick foliage and swamp it would have been easily possible to miss the wreckage			0
@entity240 , an official with the @entity241 , explained how heavy winter snow had turned the area where the plane was found had turned the area into an ' inaccessible bog ' last summer			1
and interior ministry official @entity150 also dismissed claims of a conspiracy to cover up the truth			0
part of the plane is indeed submerged in the swamp , he said , and it was a ' miracle ' that hunters had spotted the debris			0
' fragments can not be seen from the distance of 20 meters even now when the trees are not green yet , ' he said			0
' according to the hunters who found the plane , they had come to the site by chance and only because the ice in the bog has not melted yet and they could walk on it			1
in a few days the bog will be already impassable			0
' the bones from the site are now undergoing dna testing and are expected to be handed to relatives for burial in around two weeks			0
other debris will remain at the site for a few days as evidence is collected , and will then be sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of the crash , said an official from @entity277			0
oddly there will be no black box data on the @entity4 's final flight			1
' in this case the black box did not work			0
or was not switched on , ' said mr @entity283 .			0

the @entity4 and its 13 passengers went missing on june 11 last year
extensive searches lasting months turned up nothing
now questions are asked as to why it was not found earlier
