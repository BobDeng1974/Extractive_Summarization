by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 20:05 est , 14 may 2013 @entity3 , druid and pagan weddings could be made legal across @entity6 under proposals from @entity8 , it was claimed last night			1
they want to change the law to allow humanist weddings , for couples who do not want a religious or civil marriage to express their commitment			1
but @entity15 say such an amendment would ‘ dilute ’ the institution of marriage by allowing other ‘ ridiculous ’ sects to marry couples			1
tories fear pagan marriage ceremonies like this one in @entity23 could undermine the principle of marriage if they are legalised in @entity27 , where humanist weddings have been legal since 2005 , marriages have also been solemnized by the @entity29 , the @entity30 and a faith healing group called the @entity32			1
@entity33 , which has around 40,000 followers in @entity6 , is based on ‘ reason and humanity ’ rather than religious belief			0
in @entity27 there were 2,400 humanist weddings last year , outnumbering @entity41 ceremonies			1
its practitioners carry out around 600 wedding ceremonies a year in @entity45 and @entity46 , but these have no legal force so the couples who have them must also be married by a registrar			2
@entity8 are trying to amend the same sex marriage bill , the controversial legislation to allow gay weddings , to allow humanist weddings to have legal force too			1
it will be voted on next week			2
but government sources say if they are empowered to carry out marriages , it will be impossible to stop other sects going to court to claim the same power on the grounds of discrimination			2
a government source said : ‘ marriage is hugely important and binds families and society together			2
we believe allowing same - sex couples to tie the knot will strengthen marriage by making it more relevant in modern society			1
‘ but proposals such as this which seek to undermine and dilute the institution of marriage by creating a two - tiered system are ridiculous			2
we have a fundamentally different marriage system to the one in @entity27 and while they may be open to pagans , spiritualists and @entity3 ’s conducting marriages , we are not			1
the @entity83 registered 175,000 @entity84 - inspired by the @entity86 films ‘ in @entity27 there have already been pagan marriages , white eagle lodge marriages and the spiritualist union			1
we would not be able to justify making special provision for the humanists and not for other belief organisations , as it would be open to legal challenge			0
’ the 2011 census listed more than 175,000 @entity84 – the most popular choice of ‘ other religion ’			0
there were 56,620 pagans in the @entity6			0
2,418 @entity100 , 1,893 satanists			0
11,766 followers of @entity103 , and 4,189 druids			0
@entity105 , of the @entity106 , said : ‘ the amendment will give legal recognition to humanist weddings , and it refers specifically to humanists , there is no way any other group will be able to carry out marriages as a result of it			0
it is uncontroversial and it is just scaremongering by the government to try and link it to @entity3			0
‘ hundreds of couples have humanist wedding ceremonies every year and they are legally binding in @entity27 , the @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and parts of the @entity130 without any unintended consequences			1
they satisfy a very obvious need for a dignified and meaningful ceremony which is not religious			0
’ there are around 100 humanist ‘ celebrants ’ operating in @entity6 who have been trained to carry out weddings			0
couples are encouraged to not only to pen their own vows , but the whole service			0
@entity144 mp @entity143 has told mps that humanists carry out more weddings in @entity45 and @entity46 than the @entity148 or @entity149 , and the proposals would give them the same legal footing as @entity152 and @entity148 which can marry couples anywhere , not just in a designated building			1
he said : ‘ the big difference is that they do not have legal force which mean that people who have had a humanist wedding and enjoyed their special day together in front of family and friends subsequently have to attend the registry office and go through another ceremony … or they have no legal protection			0

@entity167 would allow ' ridiculous ' sects to marry couples
similar law in @entity27 has enabled pagan weddings since 2005
@entity8 are *debating* same sex marriage bill before vote next week
