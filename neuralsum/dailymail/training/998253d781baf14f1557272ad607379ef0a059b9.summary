by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 2 february 2013 pressure : @entity2 is facing renewed pressure as senior doctors are ' considering their position ' at @entity6 in @entity7 following plans to downgrade its casualty department health secretary @entity2 faces an unprecedented backlash from @entity12 who have threatened to quit executive roles over his controversial decision to downgrade a highly successful @entity16 unit			1
in what would be the first walkout of its kind , senior gps could resign over mr @entity2 ’s decision last thursday to disregard their views and turn @entity6 ’s well - regarded casualty department – where 115,000 patients are treated every year – into ‘ a tweaked urgent care centre ’			1
it means the most seriously ill patients will now be taken to other hospitals in a bid to divert @entity32 money from @entity6 , @entity7 - @entity7 , to a neighbouring @entity33 which is in danger of going bankrupt			1
the minister has refused to answer questions from @entity37 about his decision and has ‘ gone away for the weekend with his family ’ , according to a spokeswoman			1
mr @entity2 has also left behind confusion among doctors and managers as to which services will be left intact at @entity6 , and the threat of a judicial review over his decision			2
seven gps on the executive board of the local @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , which represents 170 family doctors in the area , are now said to be ‘ considering their position ’ after claiming their overwhelming opposition to the proposals were ignored by the minister			1
dr @entity60 , chairwoman of @entity52 , said : ‘ there ’s a view that if we on the @entity52 board ca n’t influence something as important as this then how can we expect to influence anything ? it ’s a definite option for people , including me , to stand down			2
under threat : the most seriously ill patients at @entity6 , pictured , will now be taken to other hospitals in a bid to divert @entity32 money fears : residents and senior doctors have expressed concerns about the changes to the @entity16 , which treats 115,000 every year ' mr @entity2 has clearly ignored our position and we have not been listened to at any stage			1
‘ he would n’t speak to us , but instead he was hearing from officials from @entity84 and the @entity85 who are keen to produce this kind of result across the capital so were determined to make this work			0
’ any resignations would prove highly embarrassing and potentially problematic for mr @entity2 because @entity91 are set to take over responsibility for commissioning hospital services from @entity94 in april			0
dr @entity60 explained : ‘ we ’ll have an impossible task to control our own budget because we ca n’t control where our patients will go for hospital treatment any more			2
i ’ve been asked to do a task which is no longer possible			0
none of us on the board are prepared to lead an organisation into failure			0
’ dr @entity60 , chairwoman of @entity106 said : ' mr @entity2 has clearly ignored our position and we have not been listened to at any stage ' campaigners and @entity109 have threatened to launch a judicial review of the decision , supported by shadow health secretary @entity112			0
he said the doctors and residents of @entity6 had been ‘ treated with contempt ’			2
a spokeswoman for mr @entity2 said it was ‘ perfectly legal ’ to alter services at the trust			0
she added : ‘ the decision protects the clinical interests of patients in @entity7 and helps relieve the burden of historic debt so money can be spent on high quality patient care			0
