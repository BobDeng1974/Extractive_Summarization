by @entity0 published : 21:50 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 3 may 2013 the @entity1 office of inspector general is investigating an internal review board which largely cleared then - secretary of state @entity3 and other high - ranking officials of wrongdoing in connection with the 2012 terrorist attack on the @entity10 @entity9 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the assault on the diplomatic compound left @entity10 ambassador @entity15 and three others dead			1
but the @entity17 has relied on the pronouncements of the @entity19 , whose credibility is now being challenged for allegedly failing to interview key witnesses who specifically requested to be heard			0
former @entity10 ambassador to the @entity25 @entity24 and former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral @entity23 co-chaired the blue - ribbon panel			1
one was @entity10 ambassador to @entity12 @entity15 , who had requested more security forces but got no help from the @entity1 @entity1 deputy inspector general @entity36 ( @entity37 ) has n't publicly confirmed that his office is probing the @entity19 , but @entity39 reports that an investigation is underway			1
former @entity25 ambassador @entity24 ( r ) co-chaired the panel with former @entity42 chairman @entity23 it blamed the @entity11 catastrophe on ' systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels ' inside the @entity1 , but said nothing about responsibility that might be shared by @entity3 and president @entity51			1
the report also concluded that despite ambassador @entity15 ' repeated requests for more security forces at diplomatic installations in @entity12 , no military resources were close enough to @entity11 to intervene during the sept. 11 , 2012 attack			1
but accounts published in october indicate that at least one navy seal team that was about a mile away from the consulate was told by superiors to ' stand down ' during the raid instead of rushing to the aid of its employees			0
@entity39 has also reported that @entity68 special operators were told to wait before approaching @entity11			0
the @entity69 has denied those reports , insisting that no such requests were turned down			0
followers of the @entity73 burned the @entity10 flag in @entity11 , @entity12 , three days after the raid on the @entity10 > consulate there			1
' @entity51 , @entity51 , ' they chanted , ' we are all @entity79 ' blood stains at the main gate of the consulate were believed to be from one of the @entity10 staff members after militant terrorists attacked the outpost with mortars and rocket - propelled grenades then - secretary of state @entity3 and president @entity51 spoke at @entity90 three days after the assault when the remains of four victims were returned to the @entity10			1
at the time , the administration was holding to the line that protesters upset by a blasphemous @entity10 movie overwhelmed the @entity11 compound - an account later proved false @entity3 and other officials declined to answer questions about @entity11 from @entity102 until the report was completed			1
afterward , the @entity17 and others leaned heavily on the report to claim @entity3 was not to blame			0
@entity107 @entity106 senator @entity106 , however , has said that @entity3 will have to fully answer for her role in the debacle if she seeks the @entity112 nomination in the 2016 presidential election			0
' i think that ultimately , if @entity3 runs for office in the future , ' @entity106 says in an upcoming documentary film titled @entity11 9 - 11 , ' she is going to have to explain why , during her helm at the @entity1 , one of two things happened : either , number 1 , they were aware of a security situation in @entity12 and failed to act accordingly , or , number 2 , they had such a bad operation that they were not aware of it			1
' sen. @entity106 , who reportedly has presidential aspirations of his own , warned that @entity3 would need to fully explain her conduct surrounding @entity11 if she were to seek the @entity17 in 2016 if the @entity19 's findings lose credibility , it will likely damage the reputation of co-chair and former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral @entity23 in her january 23 testimony before the @entity140 , @entity3 famously threw up her hands during a heated argument with @entity144 @entity143 senator @entity143 and suggested that there was little point in determining the nature of the attack and what led to it , several months after it happened			0
' the fact is we had four dead @entity10 , ' @entity3 said			0
' was it because of a protest ? or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they would go kill some @entity10 ? what difference at this point does it make ? ' the @entity51 administration claimed in the days following the terror attack that it was sparked by protesters who were angry about a @entity166 video that mocked @entity167 , modern @entity168 's founding prophet			1
' we were misled that there were supposedly protests and then something spread out of that - an assault sprang out of that , ' sen. @entity143 insisted			0
' and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact ... and the @entity10 people could have known that within days , and they did n't know that			0
' @entity10 senator @entity143 tangled with @entity3 in january over whether the administration misled the public with claims that a @entity186 video offensive to @entity168 sparked violence in @entity11 congressional investigators in the @entity189 established in late 2012 that the @entity51 administration edited a set of unclassified talking points about the attack @entity11 attack to omit references to @entity195 and other radical @entity197 terror groups			1
@entity198 reported on wednesday that sources said as many as three @entity195 operatives from inside @entity201 took part in the @entity11 attack			1
@entity204 , the group that operates in @entity201 , is also behind @entity206 magazine , the periodical thought to have provided bomb - building instructions for @entity209 and @entity210 , the accused @entity212 terrorists			2
@entity204 is the same group that said in a statement three days after the sept. 11 , 2012 military - style assault on the @entity11 consulate that it was an act of revenge for the 2012 death of @entity195 leader @entity220			0
but the group fell short of claiming responsibility for the attack four days earlier on september 10 , the senior @entity195 leader @entity224 released a video specifically calling for his group 's foot soldiers to avenge @entity220 's death by attacking @entity10 in @entity12			1
the @entity19 ' did not find that any individual @entity10 government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities ' ' those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it , ' reads the preamble to the board 's report on the @entity11 terror attack the @entity1 has lacked a permanent inspector general since the beginning of the @entity51 administration			1
although deputy inspector general @entity243 has not publicly confirmed that his office is investigating the the @entity19 's thoroughness , @entity39 reported on wednesday that his office is probing the panel 's performance			0
an unnamed @entity1 official told @entity39 that the probe is not a ' formal investigation , ' but termed it a review process that would also examine previous review boards convened to report on other past incidents			2
the @entity11 board interviewed more than 100 witnesses , but there 's no evidence they included any @entity10 personnel who survived the attack			1
at least four of them have now retained lawyers to help them circumvent what they say are roadblocks erected by the @entity51 administration to prevent them from telling @entity102 what they know			2
one of those attorneys , a former @entity269 official and @entity271 counsel to the @entity272 named @entity273 , told television audiences this week that her client is a civil servant whose career has been threatened by political appointees if he testifies before @entity102			0
@entity278 , the terrorist leader tied to the @entity201 - based @entity204 , edits			0
he is also sought to be linked to @entity201 who took part in the @entity11 attack @entity195 militants have recently been the subject of a government crackdown in @entity201			2
these criminal defendants reacted as a verdict upholding their jail sentences was pronounced at a state security court of appeals in april ' make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom , ' advised @entity195 's @entity206 ( @entity37 )			2
the periodical is thought to have influenced @entity297 , the accused @entity212 bomber who died in a shootout with police the @entity300 will convene a hearing on may 8 that is expected to include the testimony of several @entity11 survivors			2
on tuesday president @entity51 claimed he was ' not familiar with this notion that anybody 's been blocked from testifying ' about the raid in @entity12 that happened nearly eight months ago			2
@entity17 press secretary @entity307 seemed to take refuge the next day in the elapsed time since the terror attack			2
' @entity11 happened a long time ago , ' @entity307 told reporters during a briefing wednesday			0
' we are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before @entity102			0
' @entity273 has insisted that despite her active @entity318 security clearance and a demanding letter from @entity102 , the administration has blocked her from receiving the specific security clearance she would need before she could legally learn what her own client knows			2
rep. @entity323 chairs the @entity324 , which will hear testimony on may 8 from witnesses thought to include survivors of the @entity11 attack former deputy assistant attorney general @entity273 claims her client , a @entity11 survivor , has been threatened with career damage if he tells @entity102 what he saw on the night of sept. 11 , 2012 an april 23 report from @entity17 @entity271 claimed the @entity51 administration engaged in a cover - up after hte @entity11 raid , which cost the lived of four including @entity10 ambassador @entity15 ( r ) @entity336 , then a @entity112 senator from @entity337 and now the @entity10 secretary of state , visited in early february with at least one @entity11 survivor at the @entity340 in @entity341			1
as many as 30 survivors were treated at @entity340 , according to multiple media reports			0
@entity345 @entity271 @entity344 has claimed that as many as seven may still be there , shielded from the media by the federal government			0
@entity351 @entity350 sen. @entity350 said in march that he had been in contact with some survivors ' families , who told him their loved ones have been ' told to be quiet ' by @entity51 administration officials .			1

review board concluded that no specific @entity10 personnel were to blame for four @entity10 deaths
@entity10 ambassador to @entity12 @entity15 , who perished , issued requests for more security that fell on deaf ears at the @entity1
congressional *republicans* will hold a hearing on may 8 where survivors of the terror attack are expected to speak out for the first time
reports now indicate @entity201 @entity195 terrorists *participated* in the raid , which the @entity51 administration *initially* blamed on a blasphemous video
