by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 05:52 est , 13 march 2014 @entity3 fans might have thought that the trip to @entity5 could n’t get much worse after watching their side lose 4 - 1 on aggregate to the @entity9 champions at the @entity10			0
hundreds of @entity12 supporters were forced to fly to @entity13 instead of @entity14 in the early hours of thursday morning because of a blanket of thick fog over the runway at the city ’s airport			1
two @entity21 planes from @entity5 were diverted to the @entity22 from @entity5 following @entity3 ’s 2 - 1 defeat			2
more woe : @entity3 fans file through @entity25 after their flight was diverted oh dear : @entity28 reporter @entity27 was on the flight and posted this picture no way : so bad was the visibility that the planes ( not pictured ) were forced to fly further north agonisingly for the @entity12 fans on board , who had already endured watching another @entity39 disappointment in @entity40 , the plane was preparing to land at @entity14 before picking up speed and heading further north			1
@entity28 reporter @entity27 was on one of the services , and told the paper : ‘ the wheels were down and it looked like we were moments away from landing when it picked up speed and lifted			0
’ the flight circled above @entity53 for half - an - hour before heading to @entity13 airport to finally land			2
the planes were due to touch down in @entity14 at around 2am , but coaches arrived in @entity13 to take the passengers home at 5am			1
far from home : the @entity3 fans then boarded a coach at 5am from @entity13 to @entity14 stand - out performer : but @entity62 could n't prevent his @entity3 side losing at the @entity10 too strong : @entity5 beat @entity3 4 - 1 on aggregate in the round of 16 tie @entity3 had another bad night in @entity67 as first - leg goalscorers @entity68 and @entity70 bagged a goal apiece to seal their demise			1
@entity73 was also sent off for dissent when the @entity12 were denied a penalty by @entity77 referee @entity76 in the second half			0
another fan , @entity79 , 61 , was on the other flight and quipped : ‘ we had two goes at landing			0
we thought the ref might have had a word with the pilot ! ’ @entity27 , who was on the coach with the supporters , tweeted at around 8.15am : ‘ almost there ! ’ at least the @entity3 fans wo n’t forget this @entity39 trip in a hurry .			0
