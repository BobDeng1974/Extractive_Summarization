the @entity0 whose stunning account of @entity4 ’s death will be hitting bookstores next week says that his story is not intended to be political in any way			1
the former soldier , who wrote the book anonymously under the pseudonym @entity11 , revealed himself for the first time in an interview that will air on september 9			1
' no easy day : the @entity14 , ’ was originally slated to come out on september 11 , but has since been moved up to seven days earlier			1
@entity21 said they disguised his appearance for his safety speaking to 60 minutes , the seal said that he was the second person in the room when @entity4 died , and was the one who took the pictures of his corpse			1
@entity21 said that they disguised the soldier 's appearance and voice for the interview - for his safety			0
account : no @entity35 was written anonymously under the pseudonym @entity11 he said that he wrote the book in honour of the men and women who helped with the intelligence gathering that led him and dozens of other @entity0 to the compound in @entity44 , @entity45 , where the terror boss was hiding out			1
the book , he said , is not about politics			2
' my worry from the beginning is that it ’s a political season			0
this book is not political whatsoever			1
it does n’t badmouth either party and we specifically chose september 11 to keep it out of the politics			1
' he added : ' if these crazies on either side of the aisle want to make it political , shame on them			0
this is a book about september 11 and it needs to rest on september 11 - not to be brought into the political arena because it has nothing to do with politics			1
' shortly after the book was announced , the seal was identified by @entity72 as @entity16 , 36 , who retired from duty last summer - shortly have the raid that led to the @entity78 leader 's demise			1
the firsthand account of the @entity0 raid contradicts previous accounts by administration officials , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when @entity0 first fired upon him			1
@entity4 apparently was hit in the head when he looked out of his bedroom door into the top - floor hallway of his compound as @entity0 rushed up a narrow stairwell in his direction , according to @entity92			1
@entity92 says he was directly behind a ' point man ' going up the stairs in the pitch black hallway			0
' less than five steps ' from top of the stairs , he heard ' suppressed ' gunfire : ' bop			0
' the point man had seen a ' man peeking out of the door ' on the right side of the hallway			0
@entity106 : a member of @entity108 shot and killed @entity4 during the elite squad 's daring raid of his compound in @entity44 , @entity45 commando : a photo purported to be of @entity16 was published by @entity114 on thursday the author writes that @entity4 ducked back into his bedroom and the @entity0 followed , only to find the terrorist crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood with a hole visible on the right side of his head and two women wailing over his body			1
@entity92 says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner and he and the other seals trained their guns ’ laser sites on @entity4 ’s still - twitching body , shooting him several times until he lay motionless			1
the @entity0 later found two weapons stored by the doorway , untouched , the author said			2
@entity4 as wearing a white t - shirt , loose - fitting tan pants and a tunic			2
in the account related by administration officials after the raid in @entity45 , the @entity0 shot @entity4 only after he ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon			1
tension : the raid of @entity4 's @entity44 compound was watched by president @entity149 and his closest advisers in the @entity151 of the @entity152 watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity4 's compound , the @entity78 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity149 it took approximately 15 minutes to find -- and kill -- @entity4 in his @entity44 compound			1
involved in the mission in the early morning hours of may 2 , 2011 were 79 commandos that arrived in off in military helicopters from @entity165 , @entity166			0
the first helicopter foundered above @entity4 ’s compound and crash - landed in the outer courtyard			1
the other helicopter landed outside the house			0
the seal team forced their way into the compound by blowing the door with explosives			2
the commandos shot three men and a woman -- whom @entity181 officials said had lunged at them -- as they went up floor - by floor			0
on the third level , three of the @entity0 saw @entity4 standing at the end of a hallway as they reached the top of the steps			1
two women in the room took positions in front of the terror leader to protect him			0
one of the soldiers grabbed the women and shoved them away while one of the seals behind him fired at @entity4			2
the @entity78 boss was shot once in the chest and once in the head			2
code - word ‘ @entity204 ’ is sounded to @entity200 , a signal that their target is dead			0
the @entity0 then photograph the body for identification			1
on their way out of the compound , the soldiers blow up the broken - down chopper			0
the teams fly back to @entity213 in @entity166			0
@entity4 ’s body was then flown to a waiting naval ship , that buried at sea			1
@entity152 spokesman @entity217 would not comment on the apparent contradiction late tuesday			0
but he said in an email , ' as president @entity149 said on the night that justice was brought to @entity4 , " we give thanks for the men who carried out this operation , for they exemplify the professionalism , patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country			2
" ' ' @entity16 ' was due out september 11 , but @entity230 announced the book would be available a week early , september 4 , because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the @entity238 and @entity239 best - seller lists			1
the @entity240 purchased a copy of the book on tuesday			0
the account is sure to again raise questions as to whether the raid was intended to capture or simply to kill @entity4			1
@entity246 writes that during a pre-raid briefing , a lawyer from ' either ' the @entity152 or @entity248 told them that they were not on an assassination mission			0
according to @entity92 , the lawyer said that if @entity4 was ' naked with his hands up , ' they should not ' engage ' him			2
if @entity4 did not pose a threat , they should ' detain him			2
' in another possibly uncomfortable revelation for @entity181 officials who say @entity4 ’s body was treated with dignity before being given a full @entity262 burial at sea , the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound , one of the @entity0 called ' @entity267 ' -- one of the pseudonyms the author used for his fellow @entity0 -- was sitting on @entity4 ’s chest as the body lay at the author ’s feet in the middle of the cabin , for the short flight to a refueling stop inside @entity45 where a third helicopter was waiting			1
this is common practice , as troops sometimes must sit on their own war dead in packed helicopters			0
space was cramped because one of the helicopters had crashed in the initial assault , leaving little space for the roughly two dozen commandos in the two aircraft that remained			0
when the commandos reached the third aircraft , @entity4 ’s body was moved to it			1
@entity92 writes disparagingly that none of the @entity0 were fans of president @entity149 and knew that his administration would take credit for ordering the may 2011 raid			2
one of the @entity0 said after the mission that they had just gotten @entity149 re-elected by carrying out the raid			2
but he says they respected him as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go - ahead			0
@entity92 writes less flatteringly of meeting vice president @entity303 along with @entity149 at the headquarters of the 160th @entity305 after the raid			0
he says @entity303 told ' lame jokes ' no one understood , reminding him of ' someone ’s drunken uncle at @entity312 dinner			0
' terror house : @entity4 's compound has since been torn down mission : @entity4 was killed during the 40 - minute operation by the elite @entity108 in his @entity44 , @entity45 , compound , seen here beyond such embarrassing observations , @entity181 officials fear the book may include classified information , as it did not undergo the formal review required by the @entity248 for works published by former or current @entity248 employees			1
officials from the @entity248 and the @entity326 , which commanded the mission , are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author			0
in a statement provided to @entity240 , the author says he did ' not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way			0
' @entity92 ’s real name was first revealed by @entity72 and confirmed to @entity240			0
jihadists on @entity78 websites have posted purported photos of the author , calling for his murder			0
video : @entity345 ' @entity344 ' attacks @entity149 for bragging about @entity4 ...			2
