@entity1 left her post at the top of the @entity4 on feb. 1 , 2013 , but the federal government spent more than $ 55,000 on travel expenses related to her book tour just last month , procurement documents show			1
the expenses included a $ 3,668 charge for her to enjoy a single night 's lodging in a suite at the posh @entity14 @entity13 hotel in @entity15			1
that rate corresponds to the cost of a suite with a ' large and superbly appointed marble bathroom , ' a ' deep soaking tub , ' ' sparkling chandeliers ' and ' elegant period furniture , ' according to the @entity14 website			2
double - whammy : taxpayers forked over thousands for mrs. @entity1 to stay in the lap of luxury while she promoted her book overseas @entity30 diplomacy : @entity1 was photographed with @entity32 president @entity31 -- and her book -- in @entity15 last month only the finest : the @entity14 in @entity15 boasts rooms that start at about $ 1,400 per night should taxpayer money fund @entity1 's book tour ? should taxpayer money fund @entity1 's book tour ? now share your opinion purchase orders also show that taxpayers footed the bill for a $ 5,100 rental of three @entity44 executive limousine vans during a single day in @entity45			1
@entity46 could not locate records of hotel costs in the @entity50 capital			0
rental cars for @entity53 agents in @entity15 totaled a whopping $ 11,291			2
the government spent another $ 35,183 on lodging there , but the purchase order does n't say where @entity59 's personal protection detail stayed			0
the one - time first lady , @entity63 senator and secretary of state was conducting interviews in @entity66 related to her book ' @entity68 , ' and was not traveling on official government business			0
in @entity15 , she was photographed repeatedly with @entity32 president @entity31 – and the 635 - page tome			0
@entity71 , executive director of the @entity72 , told @entity46 that the expense seems odd considering the size of mrs. @entity1 's well - publicized speaking fees , which often top $ 200,000 per appearance			1
' @entity1 's book tour through @entity66 was a fiscal double whammy – lining her pockets with outrageous speaking fees and billing the taxpayers for thousands in travel , ' @entity71 said on monday			1
the @entity83 paid for the van rentals in @entity45 , billing the cost to its @entity86 ( @entity86 ) – which normally has control over investigators , not bodyguards			1
' i do n't understand that , ' @entity53 spokesman @entity91 told @entity46			0
he said that sometimes the @entity4 arranges for foreign travel for dignitaries who get @entity53 protection			0
' we would have requested the cars ' in @entity45 and @entity15 , he added , ' because we want to have control of that car that she rides in			2
' but ' i do n't understand that @entity86 thing at all , ' he said			0
doing some inspecting ? @entity83 's office of inspector general -- not the @entity53 -- paid for @entity1 's limousine rides in @entity45 while she promoted a @entity50 translation of her book ( ' @entity107 ' ) during an appearance at the @entity109 expensive ride : @entity83 rented three custom @entity112 vans like this one to ferry @entity59 and her entourage around @entity45 first ladies have historically enjoyed @entity53 protection for life after they leave the @entity118			1
the same ca n't be said , however , for former cabinet secretaries , making it curious that the @entity4 's @entity121 was on the hook for the other costs			1
' on a foreign trip like that , @entity4 sometimes pays the original bill and @entity53 might reimburse it later , ' said @entity91			0
he added , however , that he could n't say whether that would happen in this case			0
a press officer at @entity4 said she would hunt for information , including answers to the thorny question of whether her agency had paid for @entity59 's private travel on other non-government trips .			2

$ 3,668 hotel suite at the posh @entity14 @entity13 hotel in @entity15
$ 5,100 to rent three @entity44 *vip* vans in @entity45 , curiously billed to the @entity83 's @entity86
@entity4 paid for nearly $ *50,000* of the costs even though mrs. @entity1 no *longer* heads the cabinet agency
*anti-hillary* *pac* calls it a ' double - whammy ' considering @entity1 's well - publicized six - figure speaking fees
