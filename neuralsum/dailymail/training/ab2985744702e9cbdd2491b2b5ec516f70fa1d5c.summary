the organization focuses on the collection and distribution of tactical intelligence concerning the southwest border and is run jointly by the @entity19 and @entity20			0
‘ of the 230 migrants interviewed , 219 cited the primary reason for migrating to the @entity7 was the perception of @entity7 immigration laws granting free passes or permisos to @entity27 ( unaccompanied children ) and adult females @entity29 ( other than @entity4 ) traveling with minors , ’ said the report , which was leaked to @entity32			1
‘ these cartels have seen a weakness in the system			0
they 've seen statements coming from the administration that they have used in order to just frankly increase the number of people coming over , ’ rep. @entity47 , @entity48 , told reporters on tuesday			0
‘ it 's a critical situation and if we do n't deal with it urgently but well - done right - then we 're facing a crisis of just huge proportions , ’ said @entity47 , who recently visited @entity9			0
the intelligence assessment , meant only for law enforcement , also cited data from the @entity66 saying despite an explosion in the number of illegal minors , crime data actually showed a dip in violence in @entity72 , @entity73 and most significantly @entity74			1

@entity85 officials have previously stressed that a combination of factors , including a bad economy and security concerns , are behind the unprecedented surge			1
earlier this month , the federal government launched a $ 1 million media campaign to try and combat the surge by urging @entity9 parents not to send their children to the @entity7 as illegals			1
the message aimed primarily at @entity74 , @entity72 and @entity73 is two - part : the trip to the @entity7 is extremely dangerous , and immigrants who make it here will not be allowed to stay			1

the track features lyrics such as : ' migrants from everywhere , entrenched along the rail ties			2
' far away from where they come , further away from where they go			0
' they call her the @entity79 from the @entity149 , this wretched train of death			0
' with the devil in the boiler , whistles , roars , twists and turns			0
' the song is just one part of the @entity122 which will employ hundreds of billboards and some 6,500 public service announcements for radio and television stations in the target countries			0
the television and radio spots all finish with a similar parting message : ' they are our future			0
protect them ' one offering has an image of a child 's footprints in the desert running toward the horizon with the message in @entity120 : ‘ i thought it would be easy for my son to get papers in the @entity7			1
’ a television spot slated to air in @entity72 shows a teenage boy preparing to leave home for the @entity7 his mother pleads with him not to go			1
he confides to his uncle - already in the @entity7 - in a letter that she 's warning him about the dangers of the gangs on the train that immigrants ride through @entity4 , the cartels that kidnap and the dayslong walk in the desert			2
ultimately , he writes his uncle , ‘ he who does n't take a chance , does n't win			0
’ the next image is of the boy dead on the cracked desert floor			0
a voice - over says smugglers ' claims that new arrivals will easily get papers are false			0
one offering has an image of a child 's footprints in the desert running toward the horizon with the message in @entity120 : ' i thought it would be easy for my son to get papers in the @entity7			2
... i was wrong ' the television and radio spots all finish with a similar parting message : ‘ they are our future			0
’ ‘ we want a relative that is about to send $ 5,000 , $ 6,000 to a relative in @entity73 to see this message and say , “ @entity227 , they 're saying that the journey is more dangerous , ' " said @entity20 spokesman @entity221			1
‘ we try to counter the version of the smuggler			0
’ @entity221 said the campaign is scheduled to run for 11 weeks			2
he will be traveling to cities with large immigrant communities in the @entity7 as well to reach the parents or relatives on this side of the border who may help fund a child 's trip			2
‘ families need to understand that the journey north has become much more treacherous and there are no “ permisos ” for those crossing the border illegally , ’ said @entity114			0
