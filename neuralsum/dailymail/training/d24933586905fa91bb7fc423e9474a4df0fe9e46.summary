@entity1 midfielder @entity0 has his eyes on a spot of revenge as well as joint - second place in the @entity6 ahead of friday 's derby with @entity8			1
the @entity9 have won their last three matches to climb to sixth place but @entity8 are also in fine form having been revitalised since @entity13 took over from @entity14 , whose only win during a disastrous start to the season came at @entity17 in the @entity18			1
' they are a different team now , ' @entity0 said			1
' a few of the players under @entity22 were n't involved then for whatever reason and they have come back in and made a difference and it 's showing on the pitch			2
@entity0 ( centre ) , pictured scoring for @entity1 in august , is eyeing revenge against @entity8 on friday @entity8 manager kit @entity13 ( second left ) has also been away on international duty this week , as assistant manager with @entity33 ' we made a few changes that night as well so it 's a completely different game			1
' the mood in our camp is very good			0
it all came together in one week with three good performances back to back which is very pleasing			0
now we have one to look forward to on friday night and we owe them one after the cup game			2
' @entity1 , who were only promoted from @entity44 last season , would move to within a point of leaders @entity48 with a victory over their west @entity51 rivals and @entity0 insists they are among the front - runners on merit			1
' there was always going to be a big transition from @entity44 to the @entity6 but we 've managed it very well and we are delighted to be sitting where we are in the league , ' he added			0
@entity60 ( second left ) scored against @entity1 when the two teams met in the @entity18 ' it 's getting to that stage of the season where the table is actually a good picture of how well you have done so far , so you are aware of where you are and we want to be near the top			1
' it does n't detract from the game , the big thing is to get the three points and then look at the table and enjoy it after the game			0
' @entity8 will want to ruffle our feathers , the atmosphere was fantastic last time but we have to resist playing the occasion and not the game			1
' @entity81 manager @entity80 is glad to be back on home turf when his side host @entity83			0
city have won all three of their home matches since @entity80 took over , but have picked up just one point on the road			2
' we 're not helping ourselves with our away form but we 're not doing too much wrong and we 're pleased we 've scored goals at home , ' said @entity80			0
' @entity83 are a team that like to go forward , play with a nice intensity and score goals , even if their away form again does n't marry up with their home form			0
' but we 'll go into the game with confidence as we 've done well at home and we want to continue in the same vein			0
