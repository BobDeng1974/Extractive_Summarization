by @entity0 an iconic quote attributed to @entity2 - ' in the future , everyone will be famous for 15 minutes ' - may not have actually been said by the influential pop artist			1
the painter , sculptor and film maker , who died in 1987 , was first credited with the phrase in a brochure at a 1968 exhibition of his work in @entity13			2
but prominent art critic @entity14 has now cast doubt on its origins , citing the 1997 reminisences of fellow art expert and curator @entity19 who was an assistant on the @entity2 retrospective , held in @entity22			1
@entity2 ( right ) may not have actually said : ' in the future , everyone will be famous for 15 minutes ' , according to an art critic the show 's curator , @entity26 , had told him to include ' in the future everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes ' in the catalogue 's compendium of @entity2 quotes			1
@entity19 found no record of the quote			0
' if he did n't say it , he very well could have			0
let 's put it in , ' @entity26 reportedly said			0
writing in the @entity39 blog , @entity14 said : ' so @entity2 's phrase was actually @entity26 's – not so surprising , given that @entity26 later faked some @entity42 boxes			1
' famous for more than 15 minutes : @entity2 's 1962 painting ' @entity45 ' other accounts throw add further mystery to the origins of the quote			1
@entity50 , who was at art school with @entity2 , revealed to @entity14 that he 'd said something similar himself in 1946 , when the two artists first met			1
@entity2 , still a teenager , asked @entity50 what it was like to be the winner of a national art competition for high school students			1
@entity2 may have first heard a similar version of the phrase when he was just a teenager @entity50 said : ' my spontaneous answer was , ' it only lasted five minutes '			1
' in 2005 photographer @entity63 claimed he was the source of the line			0
in 1965 , during an outdoor photoshoot with @entity2 , some people tried to push into the shot			2
' @entity2 's looking at them and he says to me , " @entity70 , @entity63 , everybody wants to be famous " , ' said @entity63			2
' i say back , " yeah , for about 15 minutes , @entity2 "			1
my quote became @entity2 's famous words			1
' however , in a book he published in 1989 , @entity63 said the artist had uttered the famous words during the shoot , making no mention of @entity2 stealing his line			1
@entity14 says the murkiness of the phrase 's origins fit in with the way @entity2 took influences from a variety of sources			1
' by the late 1970s , @entity2 himself was mentioning the line ( not always clearly as his ) at various times and in various places and in various weird versions , even saying that he 's grown bored with it , ' he said			2
' but that does n't tell us much about whether he came up with it in the first place : @entity2 , the world 's greatest sponge , would hardly have proclaimed that he had n't coined his trademark aphorism			2
@entity2 's art and persona were all about the rewards of his sponging			2
' ' elementary , my dear @entity106 ' – @entity108 this line never appeared in any of sir @entity111 's written works			0
in 1893 's @entity113 , the words appear , but are separated by several lines of dialogue and are in the wrong order			0
' nice guys finish last ' - @entity119 baseball manager @entity118 he actually said the words , but the meaning has been taken out of context			0
@entity118 was asked his opinion of the 1946 @entity124 and replied : ' take a look at them			0
nice guys – finish last			0
' ' just the facts , ma'am ' - sgt friday in tv police show @entity133 sgt friday actually said : ' all we want are the facts , ma'am			0
' ' not a lot of people know that ' - @entity138 , @entity140 actor comedy actor @entity141 said this as he did an impression of @entity138			0
' there 's a sucker born every minute ' - @entity146 , showman reportedly said by one of his competitors , who was mocking one of @entity146 's exhibits .			0

doubts have been cast that the pop artist coined the phrase himself
