she 's currently ringing in her 60th birthday with two future kings , in itself a demonstration of how far @entity5 has come			2
raised in a @entity7 council flat , mrs @entity5 , a former air hostess , is now the chatelaine of a sprawling @entity10 pile and is grandmother to the third - in - line to the throne			1
so how did the still glamorous 60 - year - old do it ? according to those who know her , the answer is a considerable amount of hard work			1
that has helped her claw her way up from her lowly start as the daughter of sales assistant @entity40 and painter @entity41 , who grew up in a small house and attended a local state school			2
from there , she went on to train as an air hostess , attending @entity48 ' @entity47 training centre in @entity49 in 1976			1
but according to @entity51 's former royal correspondent @entity50 , the author of @entity52 : a biography , the training in those days was more like ' an antiquated finishing school '			1
@entity5 holding daughter @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , who went on to become the @entity52 the family , pictured at @entity59 , are holidaying in the tropical luxury to celebrate @entity5 's 60th birthday at a £ 10,000 - a - week villa ' they were taught how to be good listeners , how to maintain good eye contact and always have a smile on their face , ' she writes			2
' many people commented on how composed the @entity70 were at the royal wedding and it struck me that @entity5 's training provided exactly the right sort of skillset you might need to be a member of the @entity78			1
' it was here that @entity5 met her husband of 34 years , @entity81 who was training to become a pilot			1
in 1980 , just a year before the wedding of prince @entity84 to @entity85 , she and mr @entity81 married at a small church in @entity87 , @entity88			2
@entity5 , pictured second from right , has adapted well to @entity90 life , despite @entity92 's pals famously mocking @entity52 with their ' doors to manual ' air hostess impressions @entity5 , who was born the eldest daughter of sales assistant @entity40 and painter @entity41 , and grew up in a small house , has fit into royal life with ease in 1981 , mrs @entity5 became pregnant for the first time			1
her daughter , named @entity56 by her proud parents , would go on to become a royal bride			1
not , however , that her parents knew it at the time			2
instead , the @entity106 , with @entity5 unable to work because of her pregnancy , were searching for a solution to a cash flow crisis			2
the eureka moment came when mrs @entity5 began making up children ’s party bags which she sold to friends and neighbours for pin - money			2
@entity81 's cousin @entity117 , 63 , told the @entity118 : ' @entity5 was very pregnant with @entity56 and could n’t possibly continue working as an air hostess in her condition			1
' so while she was at home waiting for the baby she started making goody bags for children ’s parties among her friends			1
‘ and the business just grew so much that @entity35 eventually gave up his own admin job with the airline to work with @entity5			2
’ @entity5 stands on the balcony with the @entity84 and the @entity131 with her granddaughter @entity132 following the wedding of the @entity134 and @entity52 mrs @entity5 went on to have her second child @entity135 in september 1983 and @entity136 in april 1987 , but continued to run @entity33 at the same time			2
by 1995 , the company was so successful that it relocated into farm buildings at @entity139 and started employing several members of staff			1
despite their riches , the @entity142 lived comfortably , if not lavishly , with the children 's private education funded with the help of mr @entity81 's family trust			2
one mother , whose child was in the same house as @entity52 at @entity151 , famously said : ' there was always something slightly galling about having your child at school with the @entity70			0
' every pristine item of their clothing would have a beautifully sewn - in name - tape , for instance			0
it was unthinkable that they would resort to marker pen on labels			0
@entity5 and @entity81 leaving @entity166 , @entity167 , in july 2013 , after visiting their daughter @entity52 and her newborn baby boy , @entity27 of @entity171 ' it made other families feel rather hopeless			0
' nevertheless , all three @entity5 children proved diligent students and all went on to university , including the now @entity52 who met her husband while at @entity179			0
prince @entity92 was welcomed into the @entity5 clan , with mrs @entity5 regularly inviting her daughter 's royal beau for sunday lunch			1
now , like her daughter , part of royal circles , mrs @entity5 has adapted well to life as a royal in - law , despite early hiccups such as the famous incident in which @entity92 's friends mocked her with ' doors to manual ' air hostess jibes			1
but while @entity92 's friends proved snobbish , his family was not with the queen in particular embracing mrs @entity5			0
indeed , the warm affection and genuine enthusiasm that the monarch has shown towards the @entity106 has taken even seasoned courtiers by surprise			0
@entity52 , @entity135 and @entity201 wave to the crowds outside the @entity203 ahead of the @entity204 in 2011 despite @entity5 's more humble beginnings , she has gone on to conquer the fashion world for women of a certain age , too			1
pictured here with @entity135 at wedding in 2012 she let it be known she thought the family conducted themselves ‘ impeccably ’ since news of the royal engagement was announced and demonstrated her approval by inviting them to a number of ‘ inner sanctum ’ events			1
these include a private ‘ getting - to - know - you ’ lunch at @entity223 the week before april 2011 's @entity204 , as well as sending them invitations to her @entity227 party			0
‘ @entity230 likes them enormously , ’ one courtier told the @entity118			1
‘ her decision to invite them to @entity234 was a very personal gesture that was entirely her own idea			0
' it shows the level at which she has welcomed them into their extended family			0
’ @entity135 and @entity5 at @entity241 watching @entity242 in 2013 ; the family are avid tennis fans despite the responsibilities that come with her role as the @entity52 , @entity52 remains incredibly close to her parents			0
the @entity142 , who live in a £ 4.8million @entity249 mansion in @entity250 , @entity10 , were the first to arrive at the scene when @entity27 was born			0
they were also the first visitors to @entity253 , with the @entity52 hosting @entity254 at her @entity256 home last year			0
mrs @entity5 has also won plaudits for her style and was even described as ' sexy ' by sharp - tongued @entity260 designer @entity259			0
so popular has her look become , supermarket @entity261 produced a cut - price range inspired by the @entity5 matriarch after customers repeatedly asked for similar clothes			0
she certainly looked younger than her years as she set off for @entity268 earlier this week , opting for a pair of skinny jeans , a black top and blazer and flat boots - none of which would have looked out of place on one of her daughters			1
@entity5 and @entity52 often wear similar outfits and opt for the same colour palette @entity5 ( @entity57 ) , @entity279 ( 2nd l ) , @entity281 ( 2nd @entity282 ) and @entity81 leave the @entity203 in @entity49 in 2011 following the @entity204 the family , including @entity135 and @entity281 , are holidaying in the tropical luxury of @entity268 and staying in a £ 10,000 - a - week villa			1
it is understood that the family – accompanied by a team of @entity290 bodyguards – have taken over @entity291			0
designed and built in 1971 in the style of a @entity295 plantation , it boasts its own 30ft pool as well as stunning views			0
guests have only to walk a few feet from their garden to snorkel in the crystal - clear @entity301 in front of the house			0
each bedroom has its own en - suite bath and dressing room , and the property also has an air - conditioned gym for guests who manage to tear themselves away from the sun and sand			1
four members of staff – a chef , a butler , a housekeeper and a gardener – will be on hand throughout the family ’s stay to tend to their every whim			0
luxury holidays , royal in - laws and a multi-million pound business : it is all a very long way from the humble @entity7 council flat that mrs @entity5 once called home			1

@entity201 turns 60 on *january* 31 and is celebrating in @entity268
she started life in a council flat and is also a former air hostess
but she adjusted to royal life with ease and the @entity230 is very fond of her
in *recent* years , she has become a poster girl for mature women
