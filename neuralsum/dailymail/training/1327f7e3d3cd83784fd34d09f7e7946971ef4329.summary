by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 27 november 2012 controversial footballer @entity1 has exposed himself to ridicule by conducting an interview in @entity4 with a bizarre @entity6 accent			1
@entity1 , 30 , spoke for more than a minute in an accent reminiscent of ' @entity8 ! after making his loan league debut for @entity10 against @entity11			1
and he also insulted his host country by describing , in @entity13 , @entity6 football as ' boring ' , saying : ' maybe the one criticism of the @entity16 is it 's a leetle bit boring '			0
the @entity20 midfielder 's toe - curling display did little to substantiate his previous claim that he was ' too intelligent to be a footballer '			2
' @entity1 's embarrassing display evoked memories of both ' @entity48 's @entity47 , and , in real life , the hilarious interview former @entity30 boss @entity29 gave in 2008 when he spoke @entity4 in a @entity32 accent when managing @entity32 side @entity51			1
@entity1 , who earns around Â£ 3m a year , seemed aware of the comparison between his performance and the popular ' @entity48 character - as well as @entity29			0
following the interview , @entity1 tweeted : ' @entity56 ( sic ) eat your heart out ... ' ' in my defence , it is very difficult to do a press conference in @entity63 for a room full of @entity6 journalists			2
the alternative is to speak ... like a ' @entity48 ! ' character which is choose [ sic ]			0
its simply a case of you had to be there			0
# youstupidwomen ! ' applause : @entity1 is on loan to the @entity6 team from @entity76 side @entity20 a few hours later he decided to up the intellectual tone by tweeting a quote from the @entity80 philosopher @entity79			1
he also came up with a novel name for the language , and said : ' i am christening this new language @entity84 ... ' speaking in @entity6 before his league debut , @entity1 said : ' perhaps i should n't say it , but i 'm maybe a little too intelligent to be a footballer			1
' oh ' allo ! @entity1 sounded alarmingly like @entity47 from the hit television series the claims in a @entity6 newspaper attracted derision from former @entity94 and @entity96 player @entity95			2
on @entity97 , he wrote : ' the uneducated @entity1 is fascinating for the degree of his stupidity , his ego and his megalomania ! ' @entity1 helped his side beat @entity11 1 - 0 in the match at the @entity104 on sunday			0
well cast : here 's what @entity1 would look like if he was in the 80s sitcom ( and below ) in a couple of online virals debut : @entity1 made his league debut for @entity10 video : watch @entity111 video : ' good @entity112 ! ' watch @entity47 in action			0
