by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 09:42 est , 3 march 2014 a 31 - stone conman and his teenage son who conned a dying pensioner out of £ 17,500 for odd jobs and gardening that should have cost no more than £ 1,700 have been told to repay just £ 2.82 by a judge			1
obese @entity8 , 48 , and his son @entity9 , 19 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , made thousands of pounds by tricking vulnerable pensioners into handing over vast amounts in exchange for work worth a fraction of what they charged			1
together with accomplice @entity20 , also 19 , of @entity21 , they were jailed last august after the @entity22 admitted money laundering and all three admitted conspiracy to defraud			2
@entity25 , 19 , left , and his father @entity26 , 48 , must pay back just £ 2.82 after conning @entity27 out of £ 32,853 but last week the @entity22 were ordered to pay the state just a fraction of the money they had swindled at a @entity32 at @entity33 after it emerged that the men had little money left to pay			1
despite lawyers agreeing that the older @entity8 made £ 10,629 from crime , judge @entity36 ordered that he should pay just a nominal £ 1 , while his son , who made £ 32,853 , was told to pay just £ 1.82			2
the court heard that despite the many thousands the @entity22 had made from crime , they had no money left to pay for their crimes			1
meanwhile @entity20 , who the court heard had more than £ 4,000 available to him , was ordered to pay £ 93.76 back to the elderly woman he tricked , after it was decided that was how much he made from the crime			1
a court heard last summer how the threesome took cash and cheques for work which was either poor or not carried out			0
the @entity22 picked on an 84 - year - old man with terminal cancer in the nearby village of @entity56 , repeatedly targeting his home between june 2009 and september 2011			2
@entity20 , 19 , from @entity21 , had more than £ 4,000 available to him but was only told to pay £ 93.76 back to his elderly victim because that was all he was judged to have made from his crime they were caught out the day after the elderly man died in october 2011 , when the older @entity8 went to the man 's home to see if he wanted more work done			1
he was met by the man ’s grieving son , who became suspicious and called police			0
an expert estimated the work , for which the man had been charged £ 17,450 over two years , to be worth about £ 1,700			2
another victim , targeted by the younger @entity8 and his friend , @entity20 , was a 90 - year - old woman with dementia in the village of @entity76 , four miles from the @entity22 ' home			1
in june 2012 she told her son she had no money because she had paid it all to gardeners			0
her purse was emptied of pension money , and it emerged that she had paid them about £ 180 in three weeks for non-existent work			0
in the subsequent court case , @entity25 , who was just 15 at the start of the conspiracy and had no previous convictions , claimed to be the operator of the business			0
he was sentenced to two years in a young offenders ’ institution last august and is still in custody			0
his father was jailed for 15 months , while @entity20 received nine months in a youth offenders ’ institution			0
judge @entity36 said as he passed sentence : ' the public need to know that those who involve themselves in offences like this will go to prison			0

@entity8 , 48 , and his son @entity9 , 19 , targeted vulnerable pensioners
they tricked a dying cancer *patient* out of £ 17,000 for £ 1,700 - worth of work
with @entity20 , 19 , they conned 90 - year - old woman with dementia
she rang her son twice to say she had no money as she **'d** paid gardeners
last summer all three were jailed after admitting their part in the con tricks
but a judge ordered the @entity22 to pay just a fraction of what they **'d** made
@entity130 heard how the @entity22 had no money left , so should pay just £ 2.82
meanwhile @entity20 to pay victim £ 93.76 - his estimated *profit* from crime
