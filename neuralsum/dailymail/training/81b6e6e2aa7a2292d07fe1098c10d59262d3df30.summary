@entity0 is aiming to cause an upset in saturday 's @entity3 final , and it will make a welcome change from his last visit to @entity7 , if he does			1
the upset then was on a purely personal level , and he was on the receiving end after a ruthlessly blunt message from sir @entity11 an hour or so before kick - off in the 1996 final against @entity14			1
traditionally turned out in a specially - tailored cup final suit , @entity0 was soaking up the atmosphere with his @entity18 team - mates when @entity11 took him aside and told him he would n’t be in the team			1
not that afternoon , not ever again			2
all smiles : @entity21 manager @entity0 is hoping saturday 's @entity3 final can erase his @entity7 misery road to @entity7 : @entity21 take on @entity23 rivals @entity24 in the @entity3 final on saturday tough to take : @entity0 was told his @entity18 career was over shortly before the ' 96 @entity3 final a brief spell at @entity28 followed , but ask him to reflect on a glittering playing career , and @entity21 ’s manager will pinpoint that brief conversation on the @entity7 turf as the moment it all ended			1
as he prepares to lead @entity21 out against @entity24 , he hopes his return to a rebuilt @entity7 will provide him with the sharpest of contrasts , emotionally			1
asked about the pain of losing to a @entity42 goal against @entity43 in ’ 95 , the former @entity18 skipper said : ‘ the ’ 96 final was worse , when @entity11 told me on the pitch i was n’t playing			1
that ’s when i found out			0
it was about half - one			0
i ’d had a hamstring and had missed the previous three weeks , but , even so , it was n’t easy to accept			2
‘ he just told me there and then			2
to be fair to him , it was his way of saying : ‘ " @entity0 , thanks very much , this is it for you			1
" sure enough , it was			0
it was the most disappointing thing for me , the most disappointing moment of my career			2
a couple of years earlier , i became the first @entity60 player to lift the double , which was a brilliant moment for me personally , but this was the other extreme			0
@entity64 : @entity0 , pictured playing against @entity65 in 1995 , spent nine seasons at @entity67 ‘ he left it that late for a reason , and it is something i have taken into management			1
if you name your team at the beginning of the week , you are going to have 11 ecstatic players and 11 absolutely destroyed for the rest of the build - up			0
he would always leave it late for big games , and that was his way of keeping everyone on their toes until shortly before kick - off			2
mind you , it has taken me 20 years to get over it ! ‘ looking back , it was his way of breaking it to me that i was n’t just missing the cup final			1
he was saying your time ’s up , mate			0
for me , that was the end of my career			2
i stood there , and it began dawning on me that i was finished at @entity67			1
it was a case of saying to myself : “ look @entity0 , you ’re 36 , you ’ve had a fantastic innings , but that ’s it			1
” i had to try and take all that in , but it was n’t easy			0
‘ @entity99 scored the winner late on , but i could n’t even tell you whether i got a medal			0
apparently i did , but i do n’t regard it as the same , because i did n’t take part in the final			2
i suppose if you play in the earlier rounds , you deserve it , but everyone wants to be involved in the final			2
that ’s just human nature			0
match - winner : @entity99 celebrates after scoring against @entity14 in the ' 96 final but @entity0 admits he could n't say whether he received a medal or not ‘ i ’ll have to do the same to some of my players , and tell them they ’re not in the team , and i ’m not looking forward to it			1
it does n’t matter whether you put them in an office , a room somewhere or out on the pitch , it ’s something they wo n’t want to hear			0
if they ’ve got any professional pride about them , which these boys have , they are going to be desperately disappointed			0
‘ from a personal perspective , much as my last visit hit me hard , this one could more than make amends			0
without question , there is more pride and satisfaction from going to @entity7 as a manager than as a player , and if we can win , it would be the highlight of my career			1
‘ somehow , it has lost its glamour over the past 15 years , but when you get to the semi-final and final , it is still something to enjoy and savour			2
behold the beauty of the @entity3 is upon us			1
that , for me , is what makes it great			0
’ special day : @entity21 's players at @entity146 en route to @entity148 ahead of saturday 's @entity149 waiting game : @entity21 players stand and wait with their luggage before boarding a flight to @entity148 @entity0 provided an insight into his relationship with controversial owner @entity156 and revealed that he thought long and hard before accepting his job offer			1
‘ after what happened at @entity160 , the next job was always going to be crucial to me , and when this one came up , a lot of my pals said : “ @entity0 , are you sure ? ” , ’ he recalled			1
‘ they were a @entity166 side at best , and when i went to the chairman ’s house , here in @entity21 , he offered me a salary which i think i was earning in 1984 ! but i actually found that quite endearing			1
i said : “ do you want me to do it for nothing ? ” there was almost a bit of naivety about him , and i just thought that was terrific after some of the things i ’d experienced as a manager			0
giving : @entity21 chairman @entity156 gave a local hospital in @entity21 £ 7million last week ‘ what can i tell you about him ? he does n’t have a mobile phone , for one thing			1
in fact , he has n’t got anything new - fangled , really			0
he considers a mobile an intrusion in his life , but at least it means i ca n’t get sacked by text message			0
‘ he has been here 50 years and lives three miles away , and he gave the local hospital £ 7million last week			0
he has given more to this community than probably anyone has , and he is a genuinely nice man			0
‘ i do n’t think he could ever envisage we would reach an @entity3 final , but then none of us could			1
i ’m delighted for him , just as i am for the players and supporters			0
but the job ’s not done yet			0
it ’s only a great day at @entity7 if you win			1
that ’s the challenge we face , finding a way of beating @entity24			2
