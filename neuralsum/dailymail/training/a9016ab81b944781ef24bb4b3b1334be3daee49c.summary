@entity0 is under intense pressure to crush @entity2 in next month ’s @entity3 by - election after senior figures in his own party blamed him for the @entity9 party ’s surge			1
after losing the previously safe @entity11 seat of @entity12 to @entity2 , the battle in the seat of @entity3 and @entity15 , @entity16 , has become a critical test of the prime minister ’s authority , warned mps			1
the @entity21 had been braced for defeat in @entity12 where the @entity2 candidate was @entity11 defector @entity24 – a popular mp in the constituency			1
nonetheless , there was alarm at the scale of his triumph			0
the @entity21 took 8,709 votes , or 24 per cent			0
@entity37 took 3,957 – some 11 per cent , meaning its share of the vote more than halved			0
sources at @entity46 said they were now planning to recruit @entity37 and @entity48 voters – who strongly dislike @entity49 – to vote @entity11 in a ‘ keep @entity2 out ’ campaign in @entity3 , where former @entity24 mp @entity51 has also defected to @entity2			1
the prime minister is promising to ‘ throw everything he can ’ at the contest , which is expected to be much closer than in @entity12			1
conservative party chairman @entity56 said the by - election results at @entity12 and @entity58 had been ‘ an alarm clock message , a stark warning ’			1
but he warned @entity2 voters that the person with a ‘ big smile on his face ’ would be @entity66 , who would ultimately be handed victory if the rise of @entity2 continued to split the @entity11 vote			1
after the result , former @entity11 deputy chairman and pollster @entity70 , a regular critic of mr @entity0 said scathingly : ‘ the @entity11 leadership must take a large part of the credit for the rise of @entity2			1
’ @entity51 holds up a newspaper announcing that @entity24 has been elected as the first @entity2 mp as he seeks to follow suit in another by - election next week and veteran right - winger sir @entity80 also blamed his party ’s leaders for the rise of @entity2 , saying the result in @entity12 was a ‘ warning shot ’ across the party ’s bow			1
‘ a whole host of errors conceived or approved of by @entity11 bigwigs has fostered the steady loss of votes to the @entity92 , ’ he said			0
sir @entity80 said ‘ coalition with the @entity95 , increased taxes on the middle classes , cuts to the armed forces , failed and wasteful green policies , failing to deliver the promised referendum on @entity101 , the massive increase in international aid spending , and controversial and revolutionary social policies such as same - sex civil marriage ’ had all contributed to the result			0
he suggested that collapsing the @entity107 would show disillusioned potential @entity11 voters that mr @entity0 was serious about addressing their concerns			1
‘ in order to reconnect with our supporters , we need to break up the @entity107 , ’ he said			0
one senior source on the powerful @entity114 of backbench conservatives said the @entity3 by - election had become ‘ more important ’ as a result of thursday night ’s results			2
but he said mr @entity0 had ‘ belatedly come up with the right prescription ’ when he promised big tax cuts and reform of @entity123 free movement in his party conference speech earlier this month			1
however , another senior backbencher warned mr @entity0 could face ‘ a real crisis ’ if @entity2 wins in @entity3			1
work and pensions secretary @entity127 said voters in @entity12 could see the economy was improving but still felt a ‘ lack of security ’ and were ‘ frustrated about what they perceived as an influx of immigrants , mostly from @entity134 ’			2
‘ they were adamant that they wanted this controlled , in or out of the @entity123 , and they wanted to have their say on whether we left the @entity123 , ’ he wrote on the @entity138 website			0
‘ they were also disenchanted with what they perceive as @entity149 insincerity			0
mr @entity51 defected to @entity2 last month on the second day of their conference , and has been heavily criticised as a traitor by some @entity21 @entity49 was out celebrating until 4.45am with his new @entity2 mp after @entity24 stormed to victory in @entity12 with a majority of 12,404 votes ‘ many were clear that they understood that the by - election was an opportunity to send a signal to the government			1
yet , despite all this they could n’t have been clearer that they were also ready to be persuaded to vote conservative at the general election , that they understood the difference in the two votes			2
’ mr @entity127 added that he was ‘ struck by the fact ’ that many voters ‘ still do n’t realise that they will decide @entity170 ’s future only if the @entity11 are in power after the next election – that it is only @entity0 who is committed to deliver that referendum they want ’			1
eurosceptic conservative mp @entity176 admitted he had been ‘ attracted ’ by @entity2			1
but he insisted he had been persuaded to stay by mr @entity0 ’s promise last year of a referendum on @entity170 ’s @entity123 membership			1
‘ i came to the conclusion that if i really want to renegotiate the @entity170 ’s relationship with @entity134 , the only party that can deliver that is the conservative party , ’ the @entity153 said			0
mr @entity176 said he did not believe any more conservative mps would defect to @entity2 before the next election			1
@entity185 , the government ’s deputy chief whip , agreed , saying : ‘ part of my job is to know the @entity11 and i am confident that there wo n’t be			0
’ former conservative mp @entity190 , a barrister , said @entity2 had ‘ officially replaced the @entity48 as the spittoon for the aggrieved , the nutters , the no - hopers and thoroughly p * * * * * off ’			2
one poll has put mr @entity51 , who defected from the @entity11 to @entity2 last month , on course for victory in @entity3 and @entity15			1
however , the @entity21 have yet to select a candidate and strategists are confident they can defeat the mp – who lacks the personal appeal of mr @entity24 – by winning back supporters flirting with @entity2			1
they are also drawing up plans to woo @entity37 and @entity48 voters who dislike @entity2 – a tactic credited with delivering victory in a by - election in @entity206 earlier this year			1
@entity37 may have been given a scare in @entity58 and @entity208 , but the truth is @entity2 still remains a far bigger risk to the @entity21 the outcome of the @entity163 in may is now almost impossible to predict			2
for the @entity21 , the by - election results were abysmal			0
in @entity58 and @entity208 , their vote collapsed in a seat where they performed respectably in 2010			0
in @entity12 , they suffered a swing against them to @entity2 of 44 per cent			1
for the @entity48 , the outcomes just confirmed their catastrophic decline since their u-turn on tuition fees			0
at @entity12 , they even lost their deposit			2
@entity37 , too , was shaken			0
@entity58 and @entity208 is the sort of safe , northern constituency they should win easily			0
but they triumphed by just 617 votes after a swing of 18 per cent to @entity2			2
that demonstrates the potential threat that @entity2 represents in @entity37 ’s heartlands			2
if the voting patterns seen on thursday were to be replicated in a general election – which , of course , they wo n’t be – the outcome would be astonishing			0
a similar swing to the one in @entity58 to @entity2 would see @entity49 lead his party to an overall majority with 331 seats			2
@entity37 would lose 32 seats of its current 257 , the @entity48 52 out of the 57 they won in 2010 , and the @entity21 would lose 246 mps , leaving them with just 57			0
if @entity2 ’s success at @entity12 were to be repeated next year on a national scale , then @entity170 would virtually be a one - party state			1
but by - elections are totally different from @entity163			0
@entity2 can not fight on a national scale as intensively as they did in @entity12 , while their efforts will also be undermined by the first - past - the - post system			1
and here is the silver lining for @entity37			0
even with the powerful campaign mounted by @entity2 , @entity37 were still able to hang on in @entity58 and @entity208			2
indeed , their share of the vote actually went up by 1 per cent			0
the lesson is that @entity37 ’s safe seats remain resilient			0
the truth is that @entity2 remains a bigger danger to the @entity21			2
polling shows that 14 per cent of people who voted @entity11 in the 2010 general election plan to vote @entity2 next may , whereas the figure for @entity37 is 6 per cent			2
that gives @entity66 a key advantage in many of the crucial marginal constituencies			0
based on the latest polls , it is possible @entity37 could take some 20 of these from the @entity11 – seats that would stay @entity11 if it was not for @entity2 stealing their votes			2
in addition , there are five marginal @entity48 seats which are key @entity11 targets that could remain out of @entity0 ’s hands because of the greater number of @entity11 switchers to @entity2			1
that is why @entity66 may still win an overall majority			0
the latest average of the polls puts @entity37 on course for a majority of 18 in the @entity288			0
if the @entity21 lose the @entity3 and @entity15 by - election , they will be in real trouble .			0

@entity0 says he is prepared to throw ' everything we can ' at election
lord @entity70 said @entity0 must take ' large part ' of credit for rise of @entity2
trying to avoid second defeat to a @entity2 defector after @entity24
mr @entity24 became @entity2 *'s* first mp last night after victory in @entity12
