a @entity2 father has made medical history by having his healthy prostate removed after discovering that he carries a defective gene that boosts his risk of cancer , it was reported last night			1
the businessman ’s increased risk of cancer through the @entity12 gene is believed to have come to light when he took part in a trial at the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) in @entity17			1
he entered the trial because he has relatives who have suffered from breast or prostate cancer in the past			1
scientists believe that others who know they are carriers will choose to go down the same route ( stock image ) the @entity28 and @entity12 genes are known to be linked to an aggressive form of breast cancer			1
last week @entity32 actress @entity31 revealed she had had surgery to remove both her breasts to reduce the risk of getting breast cancer after testing positive for the rogue @entity28 gene			1
in the latest case , the @entity38 , 53 , who is married with children , asked to have his prostate removed so that he could avoid the fate of his relatives			0
it is understood that doctors were initially reluctant to perform the operation as removal of the prostate leaves men infertile and can also result in incontinence			0
it is believed there were no signs to suggest the man ’s prostate was unhealthy			0
@entity31 chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high @entity59 , the surgeon who performed the procedure , told @entity61 : ' the relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man 's prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immendiate surgery to remove the gland , but given what we do know about the nature of @entity12 , it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient			1
' following the surgery , a number of previously undetected brca cells were discovered			0
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the @entity2 , with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year			2
prostate cancer usually develops slowly , so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years			2
symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra ( the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis )			0
when this happens , you may notice things like an increased need to urinate , straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied			2
however , these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer			2
it is more likely they are caused by something else , such as benign prostatic hyperplasia ( also known as @entity101 or prostate enlargement )			0
@entity103 experts say that knowing you are a carrier of the cells is difficult , and that they believe other men may now follow suit			0
prostate cancer affects one in eight men in the @entity2 and there are 10,000 deaths each year			2
@entity31 announced earlier this week that she had a double mastectomy as she was a carrier of the @entity28 gene			1
the 37 - year - old actress 's decision was made all the more poignant by the fact that @entity31 lost her mother @entity119 to ovarian cancer when she was just 56			1
she paid tribute to her husband @entity122 and family who supported her decision			0
in an editorial piece in the @entity126 entitled ' @entity127 ' , @entity31 wrote : ' i am fortunate to have a partner , @entity122 , who is so loving and supportive			1
' so to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this , know that you are a very important part of the transition			0
@entity122 was at the @entity136 , where i was treated , for every minute of the surgeries			0
following the operations , @entity31 's risk of contracting breast cancer has now dropped to under five per cent			1
she wrote : ' my doctors estimated that i had an 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer , although the risk is different in the case of each woman			2
