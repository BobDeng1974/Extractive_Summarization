by @entity0 a pair of fraudsters claimed their marriage had ended on their wedding night so they could live a life of luxury by falsely claiming more than £ 100,000 in benefits			1
@entity11 , 50 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , used the elaborate scam to swindle more than £ 108,000 in benefits , while she drove around in a @entity16 and took her family on expensive holidays			1
her husband @entity19 , 52 , claimed he had walked out on his wife on their wedding day in 2000 , leaving mrs @entity11 as a ' single mother '			1
@entity19 , 52 , pictured left , and his wife @entity25 , 50 , pictured right , from @entity13 , tried to hide their faces after being convicted of fraud for swindling for more than £ 100,000 in benefits at @entity30 but the ' estranged ' couple had been living together the whole time and even shared a bank account			1
all the bills at the home were paid by mr @entity19 - who claimed not to live there - while the payslips from his job at @entity39 were also sent to the house			0
now the pair - who tried to hide their faces as they left @entity30 - have been convicted of fraud after a jury ' wholly rejected ' their story			2
the court heard the scam began when mrs @entity11 , a mother of five , started claiming income support , employment support , tax credits and council tax relief by saying she was a single mother			1
mr @entity19 played his part in the scheme by claiming he had walked out of their wedding reception and did not see his bride again for two weeks after the wedding			0
the former @entity39 worker - who the court heard was previously convicted for stealing post from his employer - said the pair remained apart after that			0
but while mrs @entity11 was claiming the benefits , she drove a @entity16 with a personalised number plate and bought a £ 27,000 luxury caravan berthed in a seaside holiday park			1
during the trial , @entity30 heard there was also overwhelming evidence against the couple			0
at @entity30 , pictured above , judge @entity72 jailed mr @entity72 for 15 months and gave mrs @entity73 a 15 month sentence , suspended for two years prosecutor @entity75 said mr @entity19 's wages had been sent to mrs @entity11 's address , while the tv licence was also registered in his name			1
an expert told the trial that during one period , mrs @entity11 received £ 79,308 in benefits - but spent £ 190,721			1
the couple also only declared they were living together in 2011 , once an investigation into the benefit fraud had started , the court was told			0
the jury also heard how mrs @entity11 might have fraudulently claimed even more in benefits than the government was aware			1
mrs @entity11 has been claiming since 1996 , but @entity93 records only go back to 2002 , the court was told			2
but mrs @entity11 avoided being jailed after judge @entity72 took her children into consideration			2
she was given a 15 - month jail term but it was suspended for two years			0
her husband was jailed for 15 months for his part in the scam			0
judge @entity72 said : ' you worked together to hide the fact he was working and you were married and living as a couple			0
each of you knew what the other was doing			0
' it is a serious offence , benefits are there for people who genuinely need them			0
' speaking of his decision to suspend mrs @entity11 's sentence , he said : ' there is one reason and one reason only in your case , and that ’s your children			2
' he also ordered mrs @entity11 to complete 300 hours of unpaid work .			2

@entity19 , 52 , and his wife @entity25 , 50 , swindled £ 108,000 in benefits
