@entity1 football legend @entity0 was banned for 90 days from all football activity by @entity3 on friday night after failing to co-operate with the inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity6			1
such a crackdown on one of the world ’s best known figures in football , a @entity13 winning player and coach and the force behind the 2006 @entity13 in @entity16 , is the strongest possible sign that @entity19 lawyer @entity18 means business with his investigation			1
@entity18 had warned of severe penalties at the @entity23 this week for those who had purposely avoided being interviewed by his team and @entity0 , the most high profile of the refuseniks , is the first to be punished			1
banned : @entity3 have suspended former executive committee member @entity0 from football activities for 90 days after he refused to co-operate into an investigation into the @entity31 bid associates : @entity0 pictured with @entity3 president @entity33			1
the @entity1 was on the world governing body 's executive committee when the @entity31 vote was held @entity38 : @entity0 captained @entity16 to the @entity13 on home territory in 1974 ' i really do not know why , " @entity0 told @entity41 in @entity16 , when asked why he had been banned			1
' first thing i did was look at the date as i thought it was an @entity45 's joke			0
' ' i am the @entity46 honorary president			0
even if i can not do this for 90 days it is something the honorary president can survive			0
' @entity0 surprisingly stepped down from the @entity49 after being part of the committee who voted to give the 2018 @entity13 to @entity53 and the 2022 edition to @entity55 with the @entity55 bid mired in allegations of vote buying			1
a @entity3 statement said : ‘ the apparent breach relates to mr @entity62 ’s failure to co-operate with an @entity64 investigation despite repeated requests for his assistance			2
’ there has been speculation that @entity18 , who is due to deliver his report to @entity3 after the @entity13 , had discovered some wrongdoing connected with all bidding countries and would not single one out in his findings			1
but the decision to discipline @entity0 suggests that @entity18 will not be afraid to recommend severe punishment – even a revote – if he finds sufficient evidence			1
request : @entity0 's 90 - day ban was demanded by @entity18 , the ethics prosecutor leading the @entity3 investigation into how the @entity31 was awarded to @entity55 inquiry : @entity18 is leading the probe into whether @entity55 bribed its way to the @entity31 in an exclusive interview with @entity85 ’s @entity84 earlier this month , @entity0 had revealed that @entity18 had sent him a questionnaire in @entity87 rather than @entity1			1
@entity0 told @entity84 : ‘ it contained some complex legal issues that i was n’t comfortable about responding to in anything but @entity1			1
’ @entity0 then went public last weeked with his reasons for swerving an interview with @entity18 , who had sent him two letters , the second of which had angered the @entity97			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i must say that i am seriously surprised about mr @entity18 ’s approach			1
i am no longer actively involved in football and he has therefore no power whatsoever to interview me			0
‘ fact is also that mr @entity18 , who is probably used to calling the shots , reacted unpleasantly to my response and tried the limits of my patience in his second missive , both in tone and content			2
i believe that the gentleman should try and understand that we like to maintain a certain form in @entity112			0
’ he added : ‘ look everybody knows whose side i was on			0
the @entity115 had a gentlemen ’s agreement with the @entity118 @entity117 and this i had a mandate			0
i had made my views clear on several occasions			0
’ in an exclusive interview with @entity85 's @entity84 earlier this month , @entity0 raised worrying doubts about the efficiency of the probe into the @entity128 bribery allegations			2
the @entity1 icon confirmed he was contacted by the commission led by lawyer @entity18 , who is due to report after the @entity13 in @entity132			1
@entity0 said : ‘ they sent me a questionnaire but it was in @entity87 and it contained some complex legal issues			2
so i asked them to re-send it to me in @entity1			2
‘ i have heard nothing from them since			0
’ the @entity97 is a good @entity87 speaker but added : ‘ i was n’t comfortable about responding to such technical questions in anything but @entity1			2
’ those most actively opposed to @entity55 being awarded the @entity144 may not have welcome one answer @entity0 would have given			1
of the allegations that disgraced former @entity3 executive @entity147 paid cash for votes , @entity0 said : ‘ as usual the ballot was secret			1
‘ i am not revealing which country i voted should host those @entity144			0
nor do i know who @entity147 voted for			0
we worked together on the @entity3 executive for four years and i regarded him as a friend			2
‘ but i can assure that i was never approached about my vote , nor was i ever offered anything			0
‘ if any allegations of corruption are proved then there is an argument for a re-vote			0
‘ one benefit of the @entity55 bid is that that in complying with @entity3 ’s requirements they are constructing 12 stadia			2
they do n’t need 12 grounds near each other			0
‘ they only need one new stadium so they are constructing in a way that 11 of them can be taken down after the @entity13 , sent to countries in need around the world , where they be reassembled			0
’ @entity0 is also on the record as saying the @entity181 would have to be played in winter			0

@entity1 legend banned at request of ethics prosecutor @entity18
@entity0 was voting member of @entity3 's @entity190 in 2010 when @entity55 was chosen to host 2022 @entity13
rejected two attempts by @entity18 to speak to him
