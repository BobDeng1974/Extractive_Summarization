@entity1 residents are getting a history lesson after a mysterious ship popped up on the beach after @entity5			1
the wreckage of a presumed @entity8 warship washed up in @entity9 , @entity10 , near @entity11 , after the category 1 storm barreled down on the @entity13			1
portions of the blockade runner had been uncovered in previous hurricanes but the strength of @entity5 's storm surge unearthed more of the ship 's structure , leaving behind a stunning scene and much debate over the ship 's provenance			1
mystery ship : the wreckage of a presumed @entity8 blockade runner appeared on the beach near @entity30 , @entity10 after @entity5 ' look what @entity5 uncovered ! ' @entity32 posted on their @entity34 page , with photos of the breathtaking remains provided by the local real estate company			1
the ship first became visible after @entity39 , in 2004 , and reappeared after @entity40 in 2008			0
' there is disagreement about this mystery ship , whether it is a blockade runner from the @entity8 or a rum runner from the 1930s			1
' ' either way , it 's quite interesting			1
this is the most visible it has been in recent years			0
eventually the shifting sands will pull it back under the beach , where it will slumber until another storm is powerful enough to bring it back to the surface , ' the posting added			2
@entity8 : it appears the ship was manufactured by the @entity60 during the @entity8 to break the military blockade established to weaken the @entity62 fast and light : the ships were designed to be longer , narrower and faster than traditional steamers guarding the coasts the wooden boat , measuring 150 feet long and 30 feet wide , is believed to be the remains of the @entity70 , a @entity62 blockade runner that had burned after it crash trying to pass the @entity73 guarding @entity74 during the @entity8			1
the vessel appears to have been powered by steam			0
the ship 's hull appears to be an old water pump and a long pipe runs down the center of the ship , according to the @entity83			2
in the @entity8 , which lasted from 1861 – 1865 , @entity85 president @entity84 ordered a blockade to cut off the @entity88 from trading with @entity89 to weaken the @entity90 during the conflict			2
a runner was a military warship used to break blockades or used in smuggling operations , because its lighter weight allowed for greater speed			0
the steamships were designed to be longer , narrower and faster than traditional steamers , stationed along the coast , so they could outrun the enemy			1
blockade : @entity85 president @entity84 ordered the blockade to weaken the @entity88			2
blockade runners ( like the one pictured ) were used to thwart the @entity73 the design was actually the brainchild of engineers in @entity110 , who manufactured them to allow for continued trade with the @entity88			1
the former @entity113 relied on exports like cotton from @entity88 farmers and investors were keen to protect their investments during the conflict			0
they also played an essential part in the war effort because they could bring much needed supplies to @entity62 states			0
‘ for this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid , ’ president @entity84 wrote in the @entity128 , in april of 1861			0
storm surge : the ship first became visible after @entity39 , in 2004 , and after @entity40 in 2008 , but the recent strength of @entity5 further unearthed more of the ship 's wreckage enjoy it while it lasts : locals say the shifting sands will pull the ship back under the beach ‘ if , therefore , with a view to violate such blockade , a vessel shall approach , or shall attempt to leave either of the said ports , she will be duly warned by the commander of one of the blockading vessels , who will endorse on her register the fact and date of such warning , and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port , she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port , ’ the proclamation continued			1
by the end of the @entity8 , the @entity73 had captured more than 1,100 blockade runners and had destroyed another 355 vessels			1
though most signs point to the ship , discovered on the @entity10 beach , having been a runner some historians are arguing over the boat ’s origin			0
some speculate it could be the @entity173 , a 20th century schooner , a sailing vessel that had run aground in 1933			0
and even others suspect the ship could have been the @entity177 , which was used to smuggle rum into the @entity85 during the @entity179 - the national ban on the sale , manufacture , and transportation of alcohol that lasted from 1920 to 1933			0
but regardless of its origins , locals are coming out to take in the sight and experience a bit of history after the storm			2
what a view : locals are seizing the opportunity to take a look at a piece of history on the beach @entity199 and @entity200 are now picking up the pieces after the category 1 hurricane made landfall last week , sustaining winds of 80 miles per hour			0
at least seven people died in the @entity85 in the storm , five in @entity200 and two in @entity199			2
more than 100,000 @entity200 residents are still without power , in addition to thousands of people in @entity199 and @entity212 .			0

blockade runners were *lightweight* warships designed to outrun traditional steamers
wreckage has previously appeared but @entity5 's storm surge unearthed even more
