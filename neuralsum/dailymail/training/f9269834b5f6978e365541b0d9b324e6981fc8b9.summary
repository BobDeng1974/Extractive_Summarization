after a slack defensive performance in game one of the @entity7 finals , @entity2 analysts @entity0 and @entity3 are expecting the @entity8 to enter game two against the @entity10 with a renewed focus			1
the @entity10 beat the @entity8 107 - 96 on sunday night , with two - time defending champions @entity8 suffering a number of defensive breakdowns that allowed the @entity10 to score their highest total of this year 's post-season			1
@entity17 led @entity10 with 24 points , while five other players scored in double figures			1
@entity21 scored 25 points for the @entity8 and @entity23 27 , but the rest of their squad struggled to get going offensively and defensively			1
the @entity27 : four - time league mvp @entity21 ( @entity28 ) knows his @entity8 team need to improve against the @entity10 the @entity30 : @entity17 ( r ) scored 24 points as his @entity10 beat the @entity8 in game one of the @entity7 finals ' we 're all waiting for the @entity8 to go into that extra gear , ' said @entity0 , an 18 - year @entity2 veteran who is now in the @entity35 and an analyst for @entity37			1
' a season ago they had a stretch where they won 20 plus games in a row , but we have n't seen that extra gear yet			0
it 's not a light switch , you ca n't turn it on and off , but at the end of the day they have @entity21 on their team			2
' when their backs are against the wall , like they were in the @entity54 series , he went for 49 points - i would not be surprised if he came out tonight with one of those types of performances			0
' @entity3 , another former player turned @entity2 analyst , said this version of the @entity8 are not as good as the teams that won the @entity63 in 2013 and 2012			1
must improve : @entity64 was neutralised in the opener and must play better if the @entity8 are to level the series ' that supporting cast is not nearly as supportive , ' said @entity3 , who played for six teams in a 10 - year career			1
' the things that they 've thrived on in the past - their ability to make threes and their defence - they 're not as good at it			0
@entity10 played great offense to win game one , but they 're not a great offensive team			2
' they were able to exploit a lot of weaknesses of @entity8 's defence and also @entity8 offensively , that suporting cast is not where it 's been in the past			0
@entity64 is going to have to play better , he was neturalised in game one and @entity23 and @entity21 are going to have to play at an even higher level for this team to have a chance			1
' @entity92 two tips off on wednesday at 1.30am and the @entity10 know a second win at their home arena will put them in pole position by the time the series moves back to @entity8 on saturday			2
presence : @entity101 put in an excellent defensive peformance against the @entity8 in game one no 2 : @entity23 ( r ) top scored for @entity8 with 27 points but he might have to be even better @entity3 believes that game two is bigger for @entity10 than it is for @entity8			1
' if @entity8 comes out and wins tonight then the entire conversation of the series is going to change , ' he said			0
' in a lot of ways this is a bigger game for @entity10 to win than it is for @entity8 , because this is a game where the @entity10 can take full control of the series			1
' @entity8 are going to win a game in @entity114 before the series is over , the question is will they have to win two in order to advance to the finals			2
' @entity0 , who played his whole career for the @entity10 , agrees that a win tonight will be huge for the @entity10 , but expects @entity122 's @entity8 team to be much better			1
he said : ' @entity124 's team were out of character			0
i think we 're going to get a better effort defensively , they 've got to be better			0
but i think we 're all waiting for the @entity8 to go to that different gear , we 've not seen it all year			0
@entity131 - supporting cast : @entity131 and @entity8 's other reserves must make more of an impact game two ' i want to see that gear from the @entity8			2
if they win tonight then the emphasis of this series changes becuase all they want to do is win one , then they go home and try to maintain and hold on and win their two games			0
' tonight will show me a lot			0
a young hungry team in @entity10 who have been screaming " we want @entity8 " all year have a chance to put them in a 2 - 0 hole			1
' there are not a lot of teams who have done that to this team with the big three , who are two - time defending champs with the best player on the planet			0
