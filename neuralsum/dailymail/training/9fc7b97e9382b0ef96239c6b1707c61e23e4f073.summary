by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 28 february 2013 ' go on , it 'll be fun ' was probably what a young @entity5 woman 's friends told her when she expressed concerns about going skydiving			1
she probably should n't have listened to them if this hilarious video , posted on @entity11 , is anything to go by			0
the unnamed blonde is first seen freaking out before she has even left the plane			1
as she is led to the door by the instructor , who she is strapped to for a tandem skydive , she begins to repeatedly scream and yell ' @entity18 ' - @entity5 for ' mother '			1
as the scream queen falls her incessant screaming appears to be briefly curtailed by a combination of shock and the g - forces exerted by free fall pulling the skin on her cheeks			2
however , she eventually overcomes these twin barriers , once again fills her lungs and lets rip with the eardrum - bursting wailing			1
the now - smiling instructor tries to encourage her as the two plummet to the ground , recorded by a camera on his wrist , but she 's not having it			0
freefall : the terrified @entity5 woman squeals at high volume as she plunges towards the ground the g - force caused by the fall pulls at her cheeks , temporarily silencing her after a few seconds of pure screaming action , the blonde @entity5 smiles as she enjoys the ride that did n't last long : her brief joy during the jump is curtailed when the parachute cord is pulled , reigniting her screams eventually , after a rare period of silence , the attractive young lady begins to enjoy the adrenaline - pumping jump and cracks a smile			1
when the instructor , now presumably partially deaf , pulls the cord and the two begin gently floating to the ground , she pulls her goggles off in apparent relief			0
despite the perception of danger , skydiving fatalities are rare			0
skydiving deaths have fallen every year since 2004			0
last year 49 people were killed worldwide , 21 of them in the @entity91 , which works out at roughly one death for every 150,000 jumps			0
tears from heaven : at a few points , the woman seems on the verge of crying soon be over : the instructor never stops grinning at the woman 's reaction video terrified skydiver screams for her mother during extreme stunt			2

the unidentified @entity5 woman screams at ear - splitting volume on jump
she changed her mind on the plane , to no avail
the blonde eventually begins to enjoy the parachute drop
