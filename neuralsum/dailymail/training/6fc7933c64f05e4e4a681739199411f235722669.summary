@entity0 is facing a striker crisis ahead of thursday 's clash against @entity3 after @entity4 picked up a thigh problem			1
with @entity6 suspended , @entity4 was a certainty to play in the lone striker role on @entity9			1
but the @entity11 forward is a doubt for the trip to @entity14 ’s , meaning @entity0 could be without a recognised striker			2
@entity4 is doubtful for @entity17 's trip to @entity3 after picking up a thigh injury @entity6 is also suspended for the @entity19 leaving @entity17 with a striking crisis ahead of trip @entity0 is facing somewhat of a striking crisis ahead of @entity17 's trip to @entity24 @entity0 confirmed : ‘ we have one alert after the game at @entity28 and that ’s @entity4 , he could be short for thursday			1
’ @entity29 looks to be the favourite to play in the striker role if @entity4 fails to prove his fitness , with @entity33 only just returning from injury			1
and @entity0 , who also revealed @entity35 will not be fit for the trip , has slammed @entity37 for their offer to sign @entity29			1
the @entity40 club want to take the @entity42 international on loan until the end of the season when the transfer window re-opens tomorrow			0
@entity29 , who is wanted by @entity37 , is the favourite to fill in up front for @entity17 on thursday @entity4 ( left ) would have played in the central role had he not sustained his thigh injury @entity37 want to pay a £ 1.5million loan fee , but @entity0 laughed off the @entity53 ’ offer , saying : ‘ that is a joke , @entity37 are not serious			1
‘ he ’s a player of @entity17 and i want him to stay			2
’ however , @entity0 did hint that he could allow @entity56 to leave on loan in january , admitting that a deal was ‘ not impossible			2
’ @entity33 has only just returned from injury so will not be thrust into the central striker role @entity56 ( right ) could leave on loan in january , with @entity0 admitting it is ' not impossible ' @entity0 also called on the football authorities to ban players who have been exposed as divers			2
@entity67 manager @entity66 this week claimed there was a campaign to paint his players as divers after @entity72 was booked for simulation , and @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m against diving			0
we should punish after the game			0
‘ the problem will be to decide when it was obvious diving or not			0
that ’s a big issue and sometimes it ’s not obvious			0
we should punish only obvious cases			0
’ wenger also believes diving should be punished harshly and that would stop incidents like @entity72 getting booked unfairly , as he did against @entity3 on sunday @entity85 here to like our @entity87 page .			0
