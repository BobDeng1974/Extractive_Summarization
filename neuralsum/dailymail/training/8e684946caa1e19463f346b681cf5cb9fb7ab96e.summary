a father - of - three died from a burst blood vessel the day after being discharged from hospital with @entity4 to treat heartburn , an inquest heard			2
@entity6 , 42 , was rushed to hospital after collapsing at work and was diagnosed with gastro - oesophageal reflux and given antacids as treatment			1
but doctors failed to carry out a @entity14 which might have spotted that a leaky artery was slowly filling his chest with blood , the hearing was told			1
project worker @entity6 is pictured here with his wife @entity20			0
he had suffered with digestive problems for the past decade			0
he collapsed at his home in @entity23 , @entity24 , less than 24 hours after being discharged and died en route to @entity26 in @entity27			1
recording a narrative verdict , coroner @entity28 said that ‘ not enough consideration ’ was given to his diagnosis and that a ct scan could have saved his life			1
the inquest in @entity27 , @entity24 , heard how mr @entity6 had suffered from gastrointestinal problems for more than a decade			1
three days before he died the project manager collapsed at work and was rushed to the @entity38			2
he was diagnosed with gastro - oesophageal reflux and - despite suffering from severe chest pains - was not given a ct scan that may have spotted any damage to his aorta			2
mr @entity6 collapsed at home on january 16 , 2012 , where his young son @entity46 called an ambulance			1
he went into cardiac arrest en route to @entity52 hospital in @entity27 and neither the paramedics nor the emergency resuscitation team at the hospital were able to revive him			1
his wife @entity20 , who was with him in the ambulance , told the inquest : ‘ i was leaning over @entity6 and his eyes went			0
’ a post mortem examination recorded his death to be haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aortic aneurysm - a massive amount of blood which filled his chest			1
the aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and a rupture is a catastrophic medical condition which carries just a three per cent survival rate			0
mr @entity6 was sent home from the @entity38 with antacids after he collapsed at work the inquest heard evidence from five doctors who treated him at the @entity38			1
dr @entity80 was a junior doctor at the time and flagged up the possibility mr @entity6 's condition may have been more serious than originally thought			1
he told the inquest : ' i considered the possibility of aortic dissection			0
‘ i asked the nurse to check mr @entity6 's blood pressure in both arms and i checked that his right and left pulses were equal in volume and synchronous , which they were			1
’ he added : ‘ i was aware that these were possible signs of aortic dissection but i was unsure how reassuring the normal findings were			0
’ dr @entity80 and senior medic dr @entity99 checked the chest x-ray , which showed no sign of aortic aneurysm or dissection - where part of the lining of the aorta breaks apart and splits inside the artery			2
mr @entity6 , a project manager at a property firm , was given @entity4 during his stay in hospital , the inquest heard			1
mr @entity6 diagnosed with gastro - oesophageal reflux and given @entity4 during his stay in hospital , the inquest heard coroner mr @entity28 said : ‘ this is a tragic case			1
the deceased , @entity117 , was 42 years of age and i would hope he would have a good life ahead of him			0
‘ my assessment is i feel not enough consideration was given to what admittedly is a rare but not impossible consideration that something had gone wrong with the aorta			0
‘ we do not think that full consideration was given to the actual matters that subsequently led to his death			0
‘ when he was discharged from hospital , he was not the man his wife knew two days earlier			0
" ruptured aortic aneurysms in the chest affect only one in 100,000 patients , but the chances of suffering one are dramatically reduced with age			2
mr @entity6 was in an age bracket where the @entity141 see perhaps only two or three cases a year , the inquest was told			1
mr @entity28 added : ‘ had the consideration that mr @entity6 was suffering from an aortic leak been fully considered , a ct scan would have been conducted			1
‘ his leaking aortic aneurysm would have been discovered and this may have led to successful surgery			2
’ speaking after the hearing , mr @entity6 's wife @entity20 said : " i am satisfied that today 's inquest has acknowledged that there are some serious issues for the trust to address following the death of my husband			1
‘ expert opinion states that his death could have been avoided if he had been given a ct scan when he visited @entity38			2
‘ indeed , the doctor dealing with him raised the possibility of such a scan but was informed by a senior that it was n't necessary - that fateful decision has completely devastated my family			0
‘ it has n't been helped by the minimal psychological support offered for myself and my children			0
‘ i will now campaign for better support for bereaved parents and children who really need it to help them rebuild their lives			0
’ mr @entity6 is survived by his wife @entity20 and their three children , @entity179 , 15 , @entity46 , nine and @entity180 , four			2
@entity20 's solicitor @entity181 commented after the case : ' we will now consider our options in terms of pursuing this matter further with the objective of securing the kind of support the @entity6 family deserve to help them cope without a husband and a father			0
‘ meanwhile , it is important to point out that this tragic event has been investigated thoroughly by the trust who accepted that @entity198 's death was regarded as a @entity199			0
‘ the @entity199 investigation has resulted in training for staff at @entity38 to ensure this ' knowledge gap ' is closed and these circumstances do n't occur again			0
