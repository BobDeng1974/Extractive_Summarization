this is the moment a volcano erupted in the snowy wastes of @entity4 's remote far east			1
the stunning pictures were captured by a @entity4 film crew who swooped across in a helicopter and braved roasting hot pyroclastic flows on the ground to create an immersive , interactive panorama			1
@entity11 is one of four volcanoes , all within 110 miles of each other , that have been active simultaneously on the peninsula in @entity4 's far east since late november			1
@entity11 erupting in @entity18 in november : the volcano is the subject of an incredible 360 degree interactive panorama by @entity4 group @entity23 the @entity25 system , which consists of the active @entity11 and it 's extinct sister @entity11 , is the largest of the south - western sector of the @entity29 volcanic group , said @entity30 , the group which captured these amazing images			1
. it was formed about 10,000 years ago , in the @entity34 , with a caldera at the summit of @entity11 about 3km in diameter			2
a regional zone of cinder cones north - east and south - west of the volcano resemble the rifts of @entity43 volcanoes			2
the south zone of the @entity11 system extends about 45 - 50km down to the @entity47 volcano and is called @entity48			1
it is here that the latest fissure eruption began at the end of november			0
shot from a variety of locations around the volcano , the incredible panorama can be zoomed and panned in much the same way as @entity57			1
it was captured in december by @entity4 non-profit outfit @entity59 , a group of photographers and panorama enthusiasts who create high - resolution 3d aerial panoramas			1
in a blog post accompanying the incredible panorama , @entity63 told how the team cancelled a trip to @entity67 to shoot the @entity68 at the last minute to capture the spectacular light show			1
' the @entity11 volcano eruption is classified as an unconventional fissure eruption			1
fissure eruptions are known for emitting great volume of lava , ' he said			0
' they are also called " touristic " eruptions for relatively low level of danger and photogenic beauty of flowing rivers of lava			0
' weather permitting , one can fly up close to a volcanic crater or hover right above a lava stream			0
we knew it all in theory , but in reality we kept our fingers crossed for a good weather			0
' the volcano was captured in december by @entity4 non-profit outfit @entity59 , a group of photographers and enthusiasts who create high - resolution @entity96 aerial panoramas the team cancelled a trip to @entity67 to shoot the @entity68 at the last minute to capture the spectacular light show @entity100 , who was among the @entity23 team that braved temperatures fluctuating from -19c to red - hot lava to shoot the volcano , recalled the dramatic scenes that met them as they arrived			1
' the volcano in front of us is covered with clouds and smoke , ' he wrote			2
' we decide to move up the lava flow			0
finally there are the first red hot lava streams underneath us ! ' we slow down the helicopter and shoot several spherical panoramas			0
we are overwhelmed - we finally saw it ! ' he told how the pilot of the helicopter braved strong winds and cloudy conditions to hover right over the hot lava flow			0
' ascending flows of hot air threw the helicopter side to side like a feather , but @entity130 held it over the spot as if it was tied to an invisible anchor			0
' every time i looked out of the window with my camera it felt like i was sticking my head into a hot oven			0
everyone was perspiring from unbearable heat and concentration			0
' the @entity23 team flew around the volcano by helicopter as well as shooting it from the ground to put together their incredible panorama @entity18 is a 780 mile peninsula in the @entity149 , with an area of about 100,000 sq / miles			1
the @entity151 and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160 volcanoes , 29 of them still active			2
the peninsula has a high density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena , with 19 active volcanoes being included in the six @entity161 sites in the @entity18 group , most of them on the @entity164			1
the highest volcano is @entity29 ( 15,584 ft ) , the largest active volcano in the @entity167			2
the most striking is @entity169 , whose perfect cone was said by celebrated volcanologists @entity172 and @entity173 to be a prime candidate for the world 's most beautiful volcano			2
somewhat more accessible are the three volcanoes visible from @entity178 : @entity179 , @entity180 , and @entity181			0
in the centre of @entity18 is @entity185 's world famous @entity183 which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in june 2007			2
this map shows the location of the @entity11 volcano on the @entity164 in the @entity149 that volcanoes erupt in @entity18 is hardly news - it boasts 29 active volcanoes - but for four to be active at any one time is the vulcanological equivalent of winning the lottery			1
the peninsula , which has a landmass slightly larger than @entity199 , is one of the most active parts of the ' @entity203 ' zone of volcanic and seismic activity that encircles the @entity205			0
it is the meeting point of three tectonic plates - the @entity208 , the @entity209 and the @entity210 - where they all collide causing massive geological turbulence .			0

@entity4 team creates incredible interactive panorama of the @entity11 volcano in the @entity149
it is one of four volcanoes simultaneously erupting on the @entity18 peninsula
shot from variety of locations , the incredible panorama can be zoomed and panned like @entity57
