researchers at @entity1 , in collaboration with their spin out company @entity4 , have created the world ’s first 3d - printed jet engine , possibly revolutionising the design and cost of aerospace materials			1
@entity4 is already working with six tier - one air space companies , however , with the unit currently on display at @entity14 , the engine is also capturing the attention of commercial outfitters like @entity17 and @entity18			2
@entity19 , @entity20 of @entity21 , told the @entity22 it ’s a ‘ very exciting time ’ with overwhelming interest in the prototype and the possible capabilities of 3d printing			1
scientists call it additive manufacturing but to you and i , its 3d laser printing			2
most people are aware of how plastic printers work , the printer head runs back and forth dribbling plastic ink along the page , for metal printing it ’s a whole different ball game			0
engineers start with a bed of fine powder which is laid down in a very thin base ( 40 micrometers )			0
once there is a uniform layer , a laser is used to melt the powder where they want to form a solid part of the structure			0
from there it ’s only several thousand more layers of powder to go down before the product is complete			0
dirty work : the 3d printing process involves layers of very fine powder before a laser is used to form the solid structure project leader and visionary , professor @entity69 , says most jet engines are very complex , taking up to 6 - 24 months to produce			1
‘ the benefit of 3d printing is we can cut down the manufacture time of those components to 1 - 2 weeks , ’ says professor @entity69			1
‘ simple or complex - 3d printing does n’t care , it produces it in the same time ’ final product : professor @entity69 ( pictured above ) with the @entity73 innovation although @entity82 are the owners of the biggest 3d printer in the world they say its unlikely the device would be used to print whole planes as it ’s ideally suited to ‘ highly complex and high value adding components			1
’ for this reason dr @entity19 ca n't see 3d printing is replace mass produced products			1
dr @entity19 told the @entity22 manufacturing turn around for smaller components will significantly reduce as process ’ that once took up to 13 different manufacturing steps and 5 - 6 months to complete could be produced in as little as three stages and only five days			0
a laser meticulously melts away at each layer to produce the printed engine not only do we ‘ improve functioning and decrease manufacturing cost , ’ there is a huge reduction in waste as around 99 - 100 % of the powder used ends up being used in the final product , unlike metal which ‘ often ends up on the workshop floor , ’ says dr @entity19			2
‘ people are only just getting around the flexibility 3d printing provides , ’ dr @entity19 says			1
the research team set up spin off company @entity4 two years ago , with a federal grant from @entity115 , to allow the manufacturing on @entity35 shores			0
@entity19 says the company ’s relationship with multiple tier one air space companies has bought them to the forefront of strategic innovation , with the next challenge to establish @entity125 as a world leader in 3d printing			1
“ a number of our companies really believe we can do what we are doing better than anyone else , ” dr @entity19 told the @entity22			0
researchers watch on as the printer produces several thousand layers to create aerospace components the sky is not the limit with @entity19 ’s sights set on entering the biomedical science sphere			0
@entity82 is currently working with @entity35 and @entity142 hospitals and staff looking for new and innovative ways of incorporating 3d printing into the medical world			1
‘ demand for product development is so high @entity82 is going to have to look at expanding , ’ says @entity19			0
he says now @entity82 has comfortably made a mark in the aero industry he is very keen to start working with @entity35 manufacturers to expand into different industries like biomedical			2
‘ our challenge now is engaging with the @entity35 community and exite them about the capabilities of the technology			0

@entity1 have @entity73 printed the first ever jet engine
the technology is attracting interest from commercial *buyers*
engineers hope to break into the biomedical technologies
@entity82 is *quickly* establishing itself as a world leader in 3d printing
