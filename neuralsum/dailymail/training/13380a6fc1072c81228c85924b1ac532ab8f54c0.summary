deportation appeal : @entity12 ( right ) leaves court with her partner , children and interpreter			1
she came to @entity6 in 2003 and was refused asylum shortly after her arrival earlier this year mrs @entity12 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , was refused leave to remain in @entity6 , meaning she and her family are under threat of deportation to @entity3			1
now , arguing her children could be taken from her if she is sent back to her homeland , mrs @entity12 has mounted a judicial review challenge to the @entity42 's decision at the @entity43 in @entity44			1
judge @entity45 told the court that mrs @entity12 flew into @entity47 in september 2003 , but her asylum application was rejected despite her claims she was from the persecuted @entity51 religious minority			0
during her years in @entity6 , she met her partner with whom she has four children - a four - year - old boy , a two - year - old girl , and twins , born in april this year			0
mrs @entity12 applied for indefinite leave to remain in @entity6 under the @entity42 's @entity59 , which gives preferential treatment to immigrants who have lived in @entity6 for long periods			2
her application was refused earlier this year			0
lawyers for mrs @entity12 argue that she now has a network of friends and an established life in @entity6			0
since the refusal of her application , mrs @entity12 has been terrified her children could be taken away from her if she is forced to return to @entity3 , the hearing was told			1
@entity3 's communist government only allows one - child families in urban areas , with parents in some rural areas permitted to have two children			1
the court also heard claims the @entity42 should have given more consideration to the human rights of the four children when processing the application for leave to remain			2
judge @entity82 has now ruled her case ' arguable ' and granted her permission to have the @entity42 's decision judicially reviewed at the @entity43 later this year			2
he said recent judgements have emphasised the importance of considering children 's human rights in immigration decisions , adding : ' it seems to me that this case does cross the threshold of arguability , and for that reason i grant permission			0

@entity12 says children could be taken from her as @entity3 has a one - child policy
wins right to appeal @entity42 decision to deport her
