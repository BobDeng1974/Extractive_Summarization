dig the bling or cringe at every flashing jewel , there is no mistaking @entity4 as the transcendent superstar of @entity6			1
now , even as he edges towards his second world title , he is thinking about life and fame beyond the track ’s narrow confines			2
having just separated from his manager @entity12 — the mogul behind the @entity13 and one - time manager to @entity15 — @entity4 has dropped his clearest hint a career in the music industry may await him			1
@entity4 has hinted that a music career beckons after he retires from motor racing @entity4 overtook @entity22 teammate @entity21 to win the @entity24 @entity23 the 29 - year - old raises the trophy after racing to victory in @entity28 , @entity29 ‘ a lot of drivers come back in commentary , but i have different plans and aspirations , ’ he said after winning sunday ’s @entity30 to extend his championship lead to 24 points			1
‘ it ’s about positioning myself so when i stop i have something to continue with			0
‘ there ’s going to be an undeniable urge to get back in the car , because i ’ve been racing since i was eight			2
@entity45 - the @entity46 3			0
( @entity51 - @entity52 ‘ at some stage , when i retire , i ’ll have something that i ’m also really interested in that is a substitute for racing			2
so that ’s something i want to start working towards			0
’ @entity4 , 29 , counts a number of rap stars as friends , sometimes bringing them to races and even putting them up in his own suite			1
and one of @entity4 ’s inner circle told me music was ‘ very much on his agenda at some point ’			1
but while he plots his next life , he must also negotiate the future of his @entity6 career			0
his contract at @entity22 runs out next year and his future is uncertain			1
but he said : ‘ i do n’t have any plans with that just yet			2
i ’m quite comfortable doing it myself			0
‘ @entity21 did his himself , @entity78 did his himself , there ’s no reason i could n’t			0
i hope to see a long future with this team			0
’ @entity4 has split with media mogul @entity12 ( r ) who includes @entity15 among his clients @entity4 's popstar girlfriend @entity85 is a regular visitor on the @entity6 tour the @entity88 @entity6 driver counts a number of hip hop artists as friends , including @entity24 rapper @entity92 it may be that @entity4 can engage a @entity6 expert as a consultant to help him with his contract , which will still be his bread and butter after all , and affiliate himself to a music - industry expert to set up his own record label			1
he also has a tight , long - standing group , including a lawyer , who often call themselves ‘ @entity104 ’ , who are sure to help			0
1 @entity4 316 pts 2 @entity21 292 pts points still on offer			1
@entity108 @entity23 ( sunday ) 1st 25pts , 2nd 18pts , 3rd 15pts @entity109 ( nov 23 ) 1st 50pts , 2nd 36pts , 3rd 30pts but one thing he has ruled out is going back into a management - client relationship with his father @entity113			1
‘ nope , ’ he said when asked about it			0
‘ me and my dad have a great relationship , he ’s aware of where i am , and proud			2
‘ i ’ve also got a great relationship with @entity12			1
he ’s a dear friend			0
that will always be the case			0
’ so is this upheaval a distraction as he looks to win the title going into the final two races of the season , in @entity108 and @entity128 — or ‘ @entity131 ’ as it has been called because points there count double ? there are still 75 points available , meaning it will go down to the final race			0
‘ there are no issues , no distractions , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ if anyone wants to get in touch with me , they go through my assistant			0
’ @entity4 could still be pipped to the title by @entity21 with double points on offer in @entity128 @entity4 laps up the adulation from @entity24 fans after making it five victories in a row @entity151 closes in on title @entity4 ’s victory in the @entity24 @entity23 showed his popularity on the other side of the @entity156 — banners of support were waved from the stands as he revelled in the cheers of the @entity24 public			1
his momentum in the championship appears unstoppable , having won five consecutive races and 10 in all			2
that total places him ahead of @entity166 as what the @entity24 would call ‘ the winningest ’ @entity88 driver of all time with 32 race victories			1
@entity166 congratulated @entity4 by tweet			1
‘ @entity166 has been very , very supportive this year , ’ acknowledged @entity4			1
‘ i see a lot of negative things said by legendary ex-drivers and i always think to myself , “ why would you not want to support me ? we ’re from the same place ”			0
‘ when i ’m gone and i come back to watch , i want to be supportive			0
i want to be seeing the next @entity178 come through and encouraging rather than kicking them in the guts			2
i want to be inspiring young drivers rather than talking crap			0

@entity4 made it five consecutive wins with victory at @entity24 @entity23
