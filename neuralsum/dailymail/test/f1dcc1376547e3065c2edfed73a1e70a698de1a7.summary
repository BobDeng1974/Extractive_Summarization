a builder who wolf - whistled a young woman only to be accused of sexual harassment said today she is a ' silly little girl ' who was ' lucky ' to have received the attention			1
@entity5 , 28 , is astonished that @entity6 , 23 , did not take it as a compliment , which he says has helped him ' snog loads of girls ' in the past			1
the builder and his colleagues whistled at her every day for a month as she passed their @entity16 construction site			2
miss @entity17 , who compared the wolf - whistling to racial discrimination , eventually filmed them and asked @entity21 to investigate alleged sexual harassment			1
mr @entity5 admits it was probably him whistling but called @entity17 smart a ' silly little girl ' who should never have gone to the police			1
he said : ' i 'm sure if she walks past again and she is lucky she will get wolf - whistled again			1
i have wolf - whistled so many girls and got so many birds and snogged so many girls off the back of that , and never had a complaint before			1
but i 've got a girlfriend so need to be careful what i say '			2
miss @entity17 , a marketing co-ordinator , contacted @entity21 over the regular taunts and the force went to the building site in @entity16 to warn the men about their conduct			1
she also filmed the whistles and handed the evidence to officers , who followed up @entity6 's complaint but had not taken further action , the force said			1
mr @entity5 , who was branded ' disgraceful ' by the judge when he was convicted for the unprovoked train attack six years ago , said : ' it 's highly likely it was me who did that wolf - whistle			1
i 've seen the news coverage and it 's not right			0
' wolf - whistling is part and parcel of working on a site , it 's complimenting a girl			1
i 'm a builder and my mates are builders			2
we are all hard working people and our reputation has been damaged ' ' i can remember that day when she took the video , we were under - pinning a wall that day			2
' i only saw the back of her , i did n't even see her face and you can see in the video the wolf - whistle comes after she had passed the gate			1
' i did n't even see her face , and i would n't recognise her if i fell over her in the street , so i do n't know how that could possibly be sexual harassment			1
' police came to our site and said someone had made an allegation of harassment			2
they showed us the video so we stopped doing it			0
' it 's not worth getting into trouble over some silly little girl			0
i do n't know why she complained , she must be thinking things above her station			0
' mr @entity5 was 23 when he received a 12 - month prison sentence for an unprovoked attack on a @entity108 to @entity110 train in 2009			1
jailing him and his friend @entity112 , judge @entity111 condemned their ' disgraceful ' behaviour after they repeatedly punched passenger @entity116 in a drunken attack			0
at the time , the judge told them : ' @entity120 behaviour like this is sadly becoming all too common			0
' speaking today , mr @entity5 shrugged off the attack , and said : ' it was all a very long time ago when i used to go around town getting p * * * * * up and fighting			2
' i was sentenced for 12 months and served six months			0
it 's the first and last time i 've been in prison but not the first time i 've had a run in with the law			0
' as far as i 'm concerned , it 's in the past , i 'm older now and i 've got a job and a kid			2
i 'm a different person			0
' ms @entity17 recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site			1
there is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage ( shown left and right ) were involved in the alleged wolf - whistling crime scene : the building yard in @entity16 where ms @entity17 alleges workman wolf - whistled at her while on her way to work ' disrespectful ' : the 23 - year - old marketing co-ordinator ( pictured ) claimed builders at a construction site wolf - whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in @entity154 earlier this week , miss @entity17 condemned men who wolf - whistle , claiming it was demeaning and compared it to racism			1
she decided to take action after the workmen whistled and made disrespectful comments towards her as she walked past the building site on her way to work , making it unbearable for her on her daily commute to @entity154			1
the marketing co-ordinator said it went on for at least a month before she decided to take action			0
she said : ' i had to walk past that way to go to work and it got so bad that they would actually come out of the building site at the time i walked down the road			2
' i often had my earphones in but i could still hear the whistling over it			2
' i eventually contacted the building company and the police when it got so bad i even considered changing my route to work but thought ' why should i do that ? ' ' i remember one of the builders , who was probably 18 or 19 , got right in my face and said ' morning love ' to me when he was stood with an older guy			1
' she told @entity191 they often ' blocked the pavement ' forcing her to walk around them			0
she said : ' i started wearing sunglasses so i did n't have to look at them			0
i started putting headphones on so i did n't have to hear them			0
' eventually it got to the day where i had enough			0
' miss @entity17 said she decided to film the workmen on her mobile phone and hand the footage to police because ' women should n't have to deal with it			1
' she added : ' i 've noticed this behaviour more and more around the city			0
' men will lean out of their cars or vans and shout comments about my appearance or whistle and i know and have seen this happen to others as well			2
' i think more women should speak out about this behaviour , maybe it will make people think twice			0
' imagine hearing someone speaking that way to your sister , mother , wife or daughter			0
' personally i do n't think that such comments , even if they are considered complimentary by the perpetrators , are appropriate			0
' it is very disrespectful and is comparable to calling out at someone of a different race or religion			0
