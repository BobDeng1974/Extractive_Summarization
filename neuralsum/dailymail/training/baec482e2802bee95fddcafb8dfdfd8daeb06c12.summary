by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 21 june 2013 mps in @entity2 are to vote on a new law which would allow homosexuals to be flogged publicly as a punishment for their ' disgrace			1
' @entity8 conservative mp @entity7 says the new law would allow @entity10 paratroopers to drag gays off the street for their punishment			1
' i want to call on people to get a healthy perspective of this disgrace , ' he told local media			2
in another attack on homosexuals in @entity22 , one @entity2 mp has called for them to be publicly flogged by cossacks , whilst @entity22 president @entity24 has backed a law banning same - sex foreign couples from adopting @entity22 children ' our district needs a law that would give paratroopers the right to grab gays on the street and drag them to the city square , where @entity10 would whip them , ' he added			1
critics say that @entity7 's bill is unlikely to be passed			1
but some are worried that it could gain support in @entity22 's current anti-gay backlash that has led to laws allowing judges to jail people for ' promoting ' homosexuality			2
in another move that will broaden @entity22 's rift with @entity51 nations over gay rights , its politicians passed a bill today barring same - sex foreign couples from adopting @entity22 children			2
the move saw strong signals of support from president @entity57			2
the @entity58 , or lower house of parliament , approved the bill by a 444 - 0 vote in its third and final reading , sending it to the upper chamber , which is also expected to approve it			2
both houses are dominated by the @entity67 party , which is loyal to @entity24			0
in power since 2000 , @entity24 has championed socially conservative values and held up the @entity70 as a moral compass since he weathered a wave of protests by mostly urban liberals and started a third @entity76 term last year			1
he has rejected @entity78 and @entity79 criticism of a ban on spreading gay ' propaganda ' among minors that the @entity58 passed earlier this month that gay rights activists fear has fuelled attacks on homosexuals			0
@entity88 foreign policy chief @entity87 said in a statement on thursday that the ' propaganda ' ban could stigmatise gays and cause discrimination , and the @entity78 has said it severely restricts freedom of expression and assembly			1
the @entity58 vote to ban adoptions by same - sex couples from abroad came as @entity100 chancellor @entity99 , who has criticised @entity24 over civil rights , met him at a showcase @entity22 economic forum in @entity103			0
@entity100 has also condemned the gay ' propaganda ' ban and @entity100 foreign minister @entity106 , who is gay , said after its passage that attempts to stigmatise same - sex relationships had no place in a democracy			0
earlier this month the @entity22 parliament issued a ban on spreading gay ' propaganda ' among minors that gay rights activists said would fuel attacks on homosexuals @entity24 says @entity22 does not discriminate against gays , but he has criticised them for not adding to @entity22 's population , which has declined sharply since the @entity120 's collapse in 1991			1
the same - sex adoption ban was rushed through parliament after @entity24 said in late april that a new @entity124 law allowing same - sex marriage went against traditional @entity22 values			1
it also bars adoptions by unmarried foreigners from countries where same - sex marriage is legal			0
the ban fits into a @entity76 campaign to restrict foreign adoptions , a sensitive issue after @entity78 and @entity79 flooded into @entity22 in the post-soviet era to adopt children			0
in december , @entity24 signed a law banning all adoptions by @entity78 , a move motivated by disputes with @entity141 over human rights and what @entity22 says is the insufficient prosecution of adoptive @entity78 parents suspected of abuse			1
advocates of adoption say same - sex couples can provide loving homes for children who might otherwise founder in @entity22 's troubled system of orphanages			0
relatively few @entity22 couples adopt despite state efforts to promote the practice			0
same - sex marriage is legal in 15 countries , including seven in @entity161 , and in some jurisdictions in the @entity78 and @entity163			0
same - sex couples are not recognised under @entity22 law and can not adopt. a march poll by the independent @entity166 found that 85 per cent of @entity22 opposed same - sex marriage			1
but there is no big grassroots movement against gay rights in @entity22 and critics say the measures are being imposed from the top down			0
' it 's pretty strange to see this major wave of homophobia in a country where two - thirds of society was brought up by same - sex couples - mother and grandmother , ' one internet user said in an online forum , referring to the problem of absentee fathers .			0

' our district needs law that would give paratroopers right to grab gays on the street , ' said @entity8 conservative mp @entity7
