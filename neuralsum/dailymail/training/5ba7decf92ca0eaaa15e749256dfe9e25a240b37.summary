but when he was examined he admitted that his injury was a gunshot wound and a bullet was lodged in his hand			1
surgeons operated to remove the bullet and contacted police who questioned @entity40 after he came round on the friday , but did not arrest him			1
fearful that his arsenal would be discovered if police searched his home , he rang his estranged wife and told her to move his four guns and other weapons to her house			1
@entity14 : @entity40 had turned on may 24 telling doctors he had hurt his hand with a drill			1
but when he was examined he admitted that his injury was a gunshot wound and a bullet was lodged in his hand later that day he checked himself out of hospital and , plagued by ' voices in his head ' , went to his wife 's home nearby where he took the guns loaded them with ammunition and returned to the hospital at 9.20pm			1
he went to the hospital 's @entity83 on surgical ward @entity85 and was seen waving a gun , before holding a nurse hostage at gunpoint and demanding access to a drugs cupboard			1
the incident lasted around 10 minutes before firearms officers arrested the pair			1
nobody was injured in the incident			0
at court @entity97 , prosecuting , said that @entity40 had initially taken himself to hospital complaining of having a drill bit embedded in his hand			1
he said : ' the police were informed and inquiries were made			1
' after mr @entity13 discharged himself from hospital he later returned with four firearms , all loaded			1
he pressed the buzzer for assistance at 9.20pm			0
' he asked nurse for drugs and became insistent			1

he then produced a gun			0
' mr @entity97 said @entity40 was shouting : ' do n't worry i 'm not going to hurt you			2
' the court heard that he then added : ' if you do n't get me any drugs soon i 'm going to shoot myself			0
' one of @entity40 's antique revolvers : he had four antique guns at his home along with other weapons including stun grenades and machetes when armed response officers arrived he raised his arm , putting the gun to his head but he was arrested after the nurse he was holding courageously grabbed his arm , knocking the cocked weapon from his hand			1
he later said of the hand wound that he does n't have accidents as he has experienced knowledge of bullets			2
mr @entity97 said that @entity40 's psychiatric report stated that the injury was the result of a botched suicide attempt			2
he said : ' mr @entity13 told police that he went back to the hospital to shoot himself			1

sentencing @entity40 , judge @entity159 said : ' over the years he had developed an interest in weapons			2
he developed considerable skill in loading these weapons with ammunition and turned them into deadly weapons			2
' it does not follow , therefore , that the events of the 25th may took place in isolation			0
he was making this arsenal of prohibited weapons			2
' on this occasion he became fixed on the idea of suicide to the point where he cared about nothing else			2
' i am willing to accept that he did not intend to shoot other people , but to shoot himself or to create a credible risk for the police to shoot him			2
it is all very well to claim the incident did not last long			0
his conduct put many people at risk and the outcome could have easily been very different			0
' i can not say that after serving two thirds of his sentence he would no longer pose a risk			0
i therefore pass a life sentence			0
' a @entity197 - type pistol : when armed response officers arrived @entity40 put a gun to his head but he was arrested after the nurse he was holding grabbed his arm , knocking the cocked weapon from his hand of @entity40 he said : ' i am quite prepared to find that there are extraordinary and exceptional circumstances for my not sending her to prison for five years			2
' what she did , as she herself well knows , was profoundly wrong			0
' a prison sentence must be passed and i am unable to suspend it			0
a message must plainly go out that anyone who does possess or move weapons in this way must face unpleasant consequences			0
i reduce her sentence to two years imprisonment			0
' box with bullets in : fearing impending @entity47 , @entity40 had stockpiled tents and tins of food at his @entity14 home , as well as explosive manuals and chemicals , and had crafted 218 bullets himself bullets recovered from @entity40 : he later said of the hand wound that he does n't have accidents as he has experienced knowledge of bullets detective chief inspector @entity239 said : ' this was a terrifying ordeal for three members of staff caught up in this incident , not least the nurse who was kept near @entity40 for the best part of ten minutes			0
' at some point or another , each of these people thought their life was in danger and that @entity40 could lose control			0
' not only were they worried about themselves , but also the other patients on the ward			0
' despite these trying circumstances , however , the victims remained calm and compliant to ensure @entity40 's anxiety levels did not increase and they all showed extreme bravery throughout their ordeal			0
' as for @entity13 himself , our detailed investigations uncovered an alarming pattern of behaviour and a concerning level of interest in warfare			1
