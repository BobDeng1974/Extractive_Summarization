now @entity39 - who returned to the school today - claims he has been told he has been excluded again ahead of a meeting with teachers and mrs @entity43 later this afternoon			2
' i 'm absolutely fuming they 've excluded him because he 's doing the best he can to get a good education , ' she said			0

protest : @entity5 originally contacted @entity27 and @entity28 to raise concerns over the quality of teaching before losing patience and organising the mass walkout last wednesday she says @entity5 eventually got so ' fed up ' that he started to organise the protest			1
' i got a voicemail from the school telling me that @entity5 had been excluded for two days and that they were going to call me back to chat to me about what he 'd done , ' mrs @entity43 said			1
' they asked me to go in with @entity5 today to discuss it but they did n't phone me back to talk properly so it 's wrong that i 'm being asked to take time off work to go in , ' she added			2
walkout : @entity5 says that on returning to school today , he was told he had been excluded again @entity5 said he felt forced into staging the mass walkout after raising his concerns to the school 's acting head teacher , his head of year , and the head of the maths department			1
he said : ' i failed my maths exam in school and i was really worried because i just wanted to make sure i was able to do the work properly			0

@entity5 said that after his complaints got nowhere , he and a group of friends decided to walk out of their lessons			2
he said that by the time the group got to the school 's playing field , they noticed a large number of pupils had followed			0
' there must have been around 100 people with me in the end and everyone sent me messages afterwards saying well done for sticking up for my friends , ' @entity5 said			2
in may last year @entity8 was placed under special measures by @entity28 inspectors who said standards were low and that there was too much ' mediocre teaching '			1
a more recent report , conducted in september , said the school was making ' reasonable progress ' - although acting head teacher @entity113 said it was still a ' challenging ' period			0
' this is undoubtedly a challenging time for the school			0
however , with support from @entity27 , we will continue to work to try to improve teaching standards , attendance , behaviour and punctuality , ' she told the @entity123 at the time , ' she said			0
' this will not happen overnight but we will continue to work with @entity28 , parents , staff and pupils towards gradual improvement , ' mrs @entity113 was quoted as saying			0
' the school has a proactive policy in dealing with complaints from both parents and pupils ... we are also passionate about ensuring that pupils and parents have a voice and are listened to , ' she added			0
councillor @entity138 , @entity27 's cabinet member for children 's services , said : ' the school is going through a transitional period ... however , this is not an excuse for poor standards and we have given additional support to the school to try to help it to improve			0
