lord @entity0 has criticised the @entity1 during a court case over the investigation of a pair of a dog breeders whose animals were unlawfully inspected by the charity 's officers the @entity1 has been rapped by a high court judge over a botched investigation into dog breeders suspected of causing unnecessary suffering to animals			1
the trial of @entity15 , 55 , and @entity16 , 59 , collapsed after it emerged the animal protection agency used the wrong warrant to enter the couple 's property in @entity21 , @entity22			2
senior judge @entity23 today threw out an application by the @entity1 for judicial review of the decision to close the case - insisting it was important ' officers of the state ' respected the restrictions on their powers			1
the @entity1 was challenging a decision of district judge @entity34 at @entity35 in june last year blocking the prosecution			1
judge @entity34 excluded evidence obtained during a search of premises owned by @entity15 , 55 , and @entity16 , 59 , who pleaded not guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering to dogs and failing to take reasonable steps to meet their needs			0
the case related to 42 ridgebacks and two @entity46 seized from @entity15 and @entity16 's house in @entity21 , @entity22 , in august 2013 , when @entity1 inspectors accompanied officers from @entity50 and the police on to their property			2
the search led to @entity1 allegations that some 17 of the dogs were emaciated , six of them severely so , and one was suffering from a facial tumour			0
all the dogs are currently being looked after by the @entity1			0
the trial was halted when it emerged that council officers had only obtained a search warrant to investigate complaints that the couple had caused a ' statutory nuisance ' because of the noise of the dogs barking and the smell coming from faeces that had not been cleared up			2
judge @entity34 found there was no warrant issued allowing an inspection of the condition of the dogs			0
the judge put down to ' inexperience and misunderstanding rather than malicious intent ' that @entity15 was advised that the @entity77 warrant permitted inspection of the dogs when it clearly did not			0
the @entity1 applied to the @entity79 in @entity80 for judicial review , arguing that even if the ' dominant purpose ' of the warrant granted under the @entity77 was to investigate a possible statutory nuisance , there was still scope for dogs found to be in poor condition to be seized and a criminal prosecution brought			1
the @entity1 went to the @entity79 to have the botched prosecution reviewed , but its claims were rejected dismissing the argument @entity23 , sitting with mr @entity92 , said local council officers and the @entity1 had gone on to premises ' intent on carrying out a search for purposes for which they had not been authorised '			1
lord justice @entity0 said it was the 800th anniversary of @entity100 and important to continue observing legal restrictions on ' officers of the state ' - and bodies like the @entity1 acting with them - entering private land			1
he said the case involved ' officers of the state aided by a well - funded charity , which does excellent work in many cases , using the power of the state to compulsorily enter land '			0
he added : ' it is incumbent on officers of the state , and those who assist them in this way , to take care that the principle of legality that has protected us well over many centuries is observed ' .			0
