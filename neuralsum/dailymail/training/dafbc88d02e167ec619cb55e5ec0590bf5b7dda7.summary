the @entity0 has given astronomers their clearest view yet of @entity3 , which experts believe could light up the sky in a breathtaking display later this year			2
the image of @entity3 ( @entity3 ) was photographed on april 10 , when the comet was slightly closer than @entity10 ’s orbit at a distance of 386 million miles from the @entity12 , and 394 million miles from @entity13			1
experts believe it will get dramatically brighter as it swings around the sun in late november , with some claiming the comet could shine brighter than @entity18 or even the full moon			1
this is remarkably small considering the high level of activity observed in the comet so far , said researchers			2
the comet ’s dusty coma , or head of the comet , is approximately 3,100 miles across , or 1.2 times the width of @entity37			1
a dust tail extends more than 57,000 miles , far beyond @entity0 ’s field of view			1
even at its current distance , the comet is already active as sunlight warms the surface and causes frozen volatiles to sublimate			2
comets become more active as they near the inner solar system , where the @entity12 ’s heat evaporates their ices into jets of gases and dust			2
a detailed analysis of the dust coma surrounding the solid , icy nucleus reveals a strong jet blasting dust particles off the @entity60 - facing side of the comet ’s nucleus , @entity53 says			0
like all comets , @entity3 is a ' dirty snowball ' a clump of frozen gases mixed with dust , formed in a distant reach of the solar system , traveling on an orbit influenced by the gravitational pull of the @entity12 and its planets			0
@entity3 ’s orbit will bring it closest to the @entity12 , of 700,000 miles on november 28			1
' as a first - time visitor to the inner solar system , @entity21 / @entity3 provides astronomers a rare opportunity to study a fresh comet preserved since the formation of the solar system , ' said @entity79 , who led a team that imaged the comet			1
' the expected high brightness of the comet as it nears the @entity12 allows for many important measurements that are impossible for most other fresh comets			0
' an enhanced image reveals enhanced dust particle release on the sunward - facing side of the comet 's nucleus , and the small , solid body at the core of the comet next week while the @entity0 still has the comet in view , the @entity96 team will use the space telescope to gather information about @entity3 ’s gases			0
' we want to look for the ratio of the three dominant ices , water , frozen carbon monoxide , and frozen carbon dioxide , or dry ice , ' said @entity111 astronomy prof. @entity109			0
' that can tell us the temperature at which the comet formed , and with that temperature , we can then say where in the solar system it formed			0
' preliminary measurements from the @entity0 images suggest that the nucleus of @entity3 is no larger than three or four miles across			1
this is remarkably small considering the high level of activity observed in the comet so far , said researchers			0
the comet ’s dusty coma , or head of the comet , is approximately 3,100 miles across , or 1.2 times the width of @entity37			1
a dust tail extends more than 57,000 miles , far beyond @entity0 ’s field of view			2
comets are dusty balls of ice , which generally originate from the @entity138 belt - a region of icy small bodies beyond @entity141			0
occasionally , a comet gets dislodged from its orbit , and plunges in to the inner solar system			0
they differ from asteroids , which are made of metal or rock , and are usually the left over remnants of planets or moons			0
comets are not really reflective - they only reflect 4 per cent of the the @entity12 's rays , about the same as coal			0
so although they look brilliantly white from @entity13 , they are black at the surface			1
@entity160 's comet is the most well - known , named after @entity161 who noted the regular 75 - 76 - year appearance of a comet , and predicted it would return in 1758 , although sadly the astronomer died 16 years before he was proved correct			0
@entity160 's comet has passed within a fraction of the @entity13 before - in 1910 the @entity13 even moved through the comet 's tail			1
sadly , the 1986 re-appearance was the worst for 2,000 years , as the @entity13 and the comet were on opposite sides of the sun.			1

@entity21 could shine brighter than @entity18 or even the full moon in november
photographed on april 10 , when it was 394 million miles from @entity13
