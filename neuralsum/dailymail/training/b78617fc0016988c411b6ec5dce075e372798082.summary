@entity0 is just four goals away from claiming sir @entity3 's crown as @entity5 's all - time top scorer after finding the net twice during tuesday 's 3 - 1 victory against @entity8			1
however , the debate over whether the @entity5 frontman is a ' football great ' continues to rage on			2
whether or not the @entity13 star compares to @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity17 duo @entity16 and @entity18 insist @entity0 is heavily relied upon by @entity5			1
@entity0 's double means he is three goals behind sir @entity3 's all - time @entity5 record @entity17 's @entity18 and @entity16 insist @entity0 is an integral part of the @entity5 set - up speaking to @entity23 , @entity16 said : ' when we talk about big - game players we talk about @entity0 and that 's what he is			1
' when we needed him most tonight he was the one who came up with the goals			0
there should never be a point where he can be dropped in his @entity5 career , he needs to be in that side			2
it 's between @entity34 and @entity35 who plays beside him			0
’ @entity18 , not convinced @entity0 is up there with the very best , added : ' of course he 's an @entity5 great			1
he 's going to be our greatest goalscorer			0
is he a world great , is he a @entity14 or @entity15 ? no he 's not			0
but he 's an @entity5 great			1
the former @entity41 defender , who himself earned 38 international caps , insists @entity0 is an integral part of @entity45 's side and said : ' he should always be in the @entity5 team , it 's nonsense to say he should n't			1
i ca n't remember the last time he played great for @entity5 but he sets up goals and he scores them when they need them			2
@entity0 runs away and does a little jump as he prepares to launch himself into a cartwheel the forward can not hide his massive smile as he prepares to go on his hands his right hand hits the floor as he prepares to bring his legs round and complete the celebration ' he 's an @entity5 great , he 's not a world great			1
only the 1966 @entity62 winners and @entity63 getting the @entity64 have lit up @entity65 for @entity5			0
' however , former @entity8 international @entity66 is n't convinced and believes a time may arise where @entity45 decides to drop @entity0			1
' he 's scoring against @entity70 players tonight so let 's not get carried away with him tonight			0
yes , on the basis of tonight , he was excellent			0
but is @entity0 up there with the greats in the world ? no he is n't			0
you ca n't say we 'll play him all the time - you can not say we 'll never , ever leave him out , because he is n’t undroppable			0
