‘ i ’d seen a story a couple of years ago in the papers about a man called @entity26 who placed a bet to lose 100lbs and won £ 10,000 and that ’s when i tried to do the same			1
‘ that year i had £ 25 on and failed in my attempt , but i was getting depressed by my weight so last @entity4 tried again with a fresh bet			1
‘ the odds this time were 100 - 1 and i placed £ 50 on to win £ 5,000 - the winnings were an added incentive to reach the target			1
‘ i fell ill with pneumonia at the start of the year and was unable to do anything for about six weeks			2
i ended up in hospital for three to four weeks with a lump in my chest that needed a drain fitting			2
‘ it was only at the end of august that i was fit enough to start exercising properly and i started with a @entity47 diet for the first eight weeks			0
‘ but my trainers @entity48 and @entity50 at the @entity52 gym in @entity53 altered my diet to make sure that i was eating the right level of calories to do the exercise			0
@entity47 helped me with the support group side of things			0
‘ i ’ve been to loads of gyms in the past , but @entity48 was fantastic and everyone at the gym was very supportive and gave me all the information i needed to reach my target			0
‘ i am single and one of the main motivators for me , apart from the bet , was i wanted to meet someone and i wanted to look my best to do it			2
@entity0 paid out the £ 5,000 winnings to @entity2 who bet who could lose 100lbs by @entity4 ‘ about five years ago i lost all the weight , but i put it all back on with lack of exercise and my diet before was genuinely horrendous			1
‘ i developed sleep apnea and got depression , but everything is back to normal now			0
my parents are amazed as they had n’t seen me for about eight weeks and in that time i dropped about 70lbs			0
‘ i have had friends drive past me in the street who did n’t recognise me			0
when @entity0 accepted that second bet they helped change my life			2
’ @entity2 , from @entity86 , @entity87 , who works for a @entity90 - based safety engineering company , was spending one to three hours a day in the gym doing circuit training and walking for 40 minutes daily with a 60lbs pack on his back			1
he added : ‘ on sundays i go out for a couple of hours and do an eight to 10 mile walk			0
i feel pretty good now , apart from occasionally being knackeredfrom training			0

@entity0 ’s spokesman @entity106 said : “ when he called to say he had succeeded we were flab - ergasted , this is an amazing achievement and he deserves his winnings			0
