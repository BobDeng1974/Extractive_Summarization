she said she is so motivated by the achievement			0
blast : an image shows the first of two bombs that detonated at the @entity5 marathon finishing line last year ‘ it just hit me : i ’ve come such a long way and even though i have such a long way to go , i ’m so blessed for this journey and to be able to help people and inspire people along the way , ’ she said			0
