@entity0 from @entity1 acted on behalf of a client who successfully argued he was in a ' friends with benefits ' relationship a @entity7 judge ruled that two men in an open relationship for seven years were technically ' friends with benefits ' and not in a de facto relationship in a landmark decision in the @entity13			1
a 53 - year - old man met a 41 - year - old man at a sex on premises venue in march 2005 , after ending a heterosexual relationship with his wife with whom he shared children			1
the pair , who can not be named , commenced a relationship and moved in together almost immediately , and lived together on and off for the next seven years while also having a sexual relationship			0
in a decision handed down last week , judge @entity26 rejected the 41 - year - old applicant 's claim he was entitled to a 40 percent share of the 53 - year - old 's property , based on what he called their ' de facto ' status , the @entity25 reported			1
lawyer @entity0 , who works for @entity36 specialist law firm @entity35 , acted on behalf of the 53 - year - old and said his client argued that their relationship was that of a ' landlord ' and a ' tenant '			1
' he came to us and said " @entity44 is not how i view this relationship - yeah we had sex and we had sex a lot but i never shared any commitment or romantic notions " , ' mr @entity0 told @entity51			0
' he had many other sexual partners throughout their friendship so there was no exclusive commitment			0
' one of the 53 - year - old 's alternative sexual partners gave evidence during the hearing in june			1
mr @entity0 said the judge agreed with his client that the men 's relationship was one of ' friends with benefits ' based on its non-exclusive nature			2
mr @entity0 added that it was a landmark decision that had implications for both gay and straight relationships			2
' it does n't change the law but it sets up a set of facts with a view to differentiate relationships from that as de facto , ' he said			0
' it 's a modern age and people are shacking up but not necessarily with a view to an exclusive life together or any kind of shared commitment			0
a @entity7 judge ruled that two men in an open relationship for seven years were not in a de facto relationship in a landmark decision in the @entity13 ( pictured ) ' they 're having sex and might love each other but they might have multiple partners			2
' mr @entity0 said the 41 - year - old applicant argued they were ' de facto ' based on the fact that the pair lived together and shared important events like @entity96 together			1
' it was really important to tell the court gay men do n't always have families around them to go to events like @entity96 , and just because they do that does n't mean they are boyfriends , ' he said			0
' and if you think about a middle aged man where all he 's know is a straight life to then realise he 's gay and go to a sex on premises venue , it 's pretty overwhelming			2
' he wanted to enjoy the fruits of being liberated but then found out he hooked up with the wrong person			0
