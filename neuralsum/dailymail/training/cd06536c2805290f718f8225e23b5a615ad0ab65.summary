officials at the crippled @entity2 nuclear plant are building a mile - long wall of ice to prevent radioactive water from leaking into the @entity6			1
more than three years after the march 2011 meltdowns , the @entity2 plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water			1
repeated leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades			0
workers place pipes into the ground around the tsunami - crippled @entity2 in a bid to create an ' ice wall ' around the plant to prevent contamination the pipes being sunk into the ground will be filled with liquid coolant which will freeze the surrounding earth in the hopes that this will decrease the amount of water seeping into plants a @entity32 official measures radiation close to the site experts from @entity32 - which owns the site - are freezing earth around the station to create an underground 1.4km wall of ice			1
the technique will work by flooding the damaged reactors with vast amounts of water in order to keep them cool			1
the water will become radioactive , @entity47 reports			2
officials said they have already tested the technique but that the water had failed to freeze the earth sufficiently			1
the wall will freeze soil around four reactors at the power plant in northern @entity58 the technique will work by flooding the damaged reactors with vast amounts of water in order to keep them cool the wall , stretching 0.9miles and nearly 100 feet deep , will be set up around reactors 1 to 4 at the @entity2 plant , which suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami			1
workers will insert a line of pipes into the ground that circulate liquid as cold as -40c - causing the earth around them to freeze			0
as well as preventing polluted water from escaping the plant , the wall will also block groundwater from flowing into the buildings ' basements and mixing with highly radioactive water leaks from the melted cores			2
workers test a journalist for radiation levels after a visit to the plant the @entity2 plant suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami			1
above , smoke is pictured rising from reactor 3 at the nuclear power plant on march 21 , 2011 earlier this year , @entity95 , a former @entity96 chairman who now heads a supervisory panel for @entity32 , said he was not convinced the ' ice wall ' is the best way to prevent radioactive water from escaping the plant			2
he also claimed the @entity102 and @entity32 should review the plan to balance risk and benefit to see whether they should spend the money elsewhere			0
' any time you make a decision , it should be based on current , relevant science , and you have to strike a balance between science and policy , ' he said			0
' at the end of the day , it may be a good alternative			0
but i 'm just not convinced			0
' @entity119 , the plant 's manager , told @entity47 the latest effort to construct the ice wall was working			2
' the ice wall itself has been tested			0
and in those cases we 've seen that the ground itself does freeze so i myself am not that worried that it will not go well , ' @entity119 said .			0

experts are freezing earth around station to create underground 1.4km wall
@entity2 plant still plagued by massive amount of contaminated water
technique will flood damaged reactors with vast water to keep them cool
it is hoped the frozen earth will then act as wall to contain contamination
