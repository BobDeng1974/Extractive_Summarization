quarter finals have been a sticking point for @entity2 this season and last night 's @entity5 draw did not spare him a difficult potential last eight match - against none other than @entity9			1
seven times in 2014 @entity2 has bowed out of events at this stage , and now a showdown with the world number one awaits , providing the @entity15 can rediscover the form that has gone missing since winning @entity17			2
@entity9 has won just two matches in two months , seemingly distracted by his marriage and the impending birth of his first child			2
yet he has the chance to play himself in next week , with the 27 year - old @entity23 having plenty to think about prior to that			0
to do so , he 'll probably have to beat the following : first round : @entity39 ( @entity40 ) second round : @entity42 ( @entity43 ) third round : @entity29 ( @entity45 ) @entity46 : @entity30 ( @entity47 ) quarter final : @entity9 ( @entity49 ) @entity50 : @entity51 ( @entity52 ) final : @entity54 ( @entity52 )			1
his first round opponent is @entity56 , the @entity57 ranked number 70 who almost knocked him out at @entity60 three years ago in five sets			1
his third round could be against hard hitting @entity63 @entity29 , with @entity64 in the fourth			0
the @entity65 had a dreadful start to the year , but roared back to form this month by winning the @entity67 - beating @entity2 en route in the quarter finals			1
this is a rough looking draw for @entity2 , now seeded eighth , as he tries to put behind him the last eight exit to @entity74 at @entity75 , but then he looked to have a bad one at @entity76 and everyone knows what happened after that			1
formidable : @entity80 is a difficult opponent to face as early as the fourth round at a @entity82 in form : @entity30 won the @entity67 in @entity84 this month , where he beat @entity2 in the quarter - final it seems ridiculous to look beyond @entity9 , but @entity2 's theoretical semi-final opponent is @entity51			1
the man most favoured to reach the final from the opposite half is @entity54 , who has amassed a 19 - 2 record since the @entity92			2
the now 33 year - old looks to have a relatively benign draw			0
overall both the men 's and women 's events look relatively unpredictable			0
@entity99 number one @entity98 has a winnable first round against @entity101 of @entity102 , who has won just one match since @entity17			0
after that it could be @entity106 , whose form has plummeted since the @entity109 final			2
@entity99 's other guaranteed entrant , @entity111 , faces @entity112 of @entity113			0
top seed : @entity115 will be the man to beat , and could meet @entity2 in the last eight no defence : @entity117 will not be defending his title after withdrawing because of an injured wrist			0

@entity2 is seeded eighth for the @entity82 at @entity60
@entity122 could face in - form @entity30 in last - *sixteen*
@entity9 is @entity2 's most likely quarter - final opponent
@entity2 opens with a match against @entity126 's @entity56
