by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 15:11 est , 8 may 2013 @entity1 are set to unveil @entity2 as their new manager by thursday evening			1
@entity4 this morning announced that his 27 - year tenure at @entity6 would end with retirement after the final game of the season - at @entity10 on may 19			1
@entity11 understands that the @entity1 hierarchy have their man and will officially announce the decision on who replaces sir @entity4 once personal terms have been agreed			2
and that man will not be @entity18 , despite his talks with @entity20 reportedly stalling this week			1
@entity1 's board members - most notably sir @entity22 - are believed to have been attracted to @entity2 due to his longevity at @entity24 and his commitment to building teams			1
the @entity27 met with @entity24 chairman @entity28 at his offices in @entity30 this evening			1
catch me if you can : @entity2 appeared in good spirits as he left @entity28 's offices on wednesday as one door closes : @entity2 arriving and leaving @entity28 's offices in @entity30 on wednesday evening heading for @entity1 ? @entity2 ( right ) leaves @entity24 's @entity37 training complex today driven by his agent brother @entity38 in the driving seat : @entity11 understands that @entity2 ( pictured today ) is the chosen successor to @entity4 who should replace @entity4 at @entity1 ? it is understood that @entity4 had planned to stand down for a while but was hoping to delay an announcement until the weekend			1
@entity2 is believed to earn £ 4million a year at @entity24 - making him the only @entity45 manager to receive more than any of his players			1
his contract runs out in the summer and he can expect to see himself climb up the pay scale considerably with a move to the champions			0
@entity18 was believed to be in the running to succeed @entity4 , who has won 38 tophies including 13 @entity45 titles and two @entity54 in his time at @entity6 , but @entity1 's directors appear to have decided against the @entity57			1
@entity2 , 50 , has previously said that he wanted to wait until the end of this campaign before deciding whether to extend his time at @entity61 into a 12th year			2
he will be happy to work with fellow @entity62 , who has taken a position on @entity1 's board of directors			0
@entity2 will also be an attractive proposition to @entity1 because of his consistency and loyalty to @entity24 during the last decade			2
his focus on bringing through youth talent is also a huge selling point for the club that selected at least one player who has come through the academy system for more than 1,000 consecutive games			0
leading man : @entity2 is favourite to replace sir @entity4 , with @entity18 in second place chief executive @entity77 told @entity78 : ' we knew this day would come and we have been preparing for that			1
the board will take council from sir @entity4 and sir @entity22 ( @entity85 ) on the new appointment			2
' sir @entity22 spoke about @entity18 previously , expressing discomfort about the idea of him replacing @entity4			0
he said : ' @entity18 is a really good coach but that 's as far as i would go really			0
' @entity22 added : ' he pontificates too much for my liking			0
he 's a good manager , though			0
' however @entity92 did say that the next man would need to possess ' requisite football experience in terms of domestic and @entity97 experience ' , which could have counted against @entity2 , he has limited experience in @entity97 , mostly coming in the @entity99 ( formerly the @entity99 )			0
however , it seems those reservations will not affect the decision to appoint him			0
@entity18 , who is likely to leave @entity104 this summer , has been strongly linked with a return to @entity20			0
his @entity107 return has hit a snag with @entity20 owner @entity109 refusing to pay the buyout clause in the @entity104 boss 's contract , as well as compensation for @entity18 's backroom staff			2
big shoes to fill : @entity4 is the most successful manager in @entity117 football history @entity118 : @entity4 is now the 4/1 second favourite , behind @entity120 ( 5/2 )			0
@entity4 is 25/1 to own the @entity122 winner in 2014 & 6/1 for the @entity124 winner in 2014 @entity109 paid @entity18 and the backroom team £ 17million when he sacked them in 2006 , and the buyout cluase in his @entity104 contract is believed to be £ 20m in the season , with a fee open to negotiation in the summer			1
@entity18 is still the favoured candidate to succeed @entity132 at @entity107 , but @entity20 want more control over the recruitment of the team surrounding the manager than they had when he arrived from @entity137 in 2004 .			2
