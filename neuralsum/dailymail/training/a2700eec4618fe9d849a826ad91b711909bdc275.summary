the recent sale of academy graduate @entity5 and the heavy spending of the summer transfer window have suggested priorities could be changing at @entity9			1

the history of the club is to play exciting football , always give youngsters a chance , keep to the traditions of the club			0
' @entity28 has left , which is obviously disappointing because you never want to see a homegrown player leave , but this is a manager who gave @entity34 his chance , @entity37 his chance , @entity38 his chance , @entity40 , @entity41 - he has got a track record of giving youngsters a chance			1
' @entity45 has played every game this season			0
underneath ( @entity51 ) @entity50 and ( @entity53 ) @entity52 you have got ( @entity49 ) @entity48 , @entity54			0

@entity82 , speaking alongside @entity0 at the @entity87 in @entity88 , said : ' i think all clubs are changing			2
