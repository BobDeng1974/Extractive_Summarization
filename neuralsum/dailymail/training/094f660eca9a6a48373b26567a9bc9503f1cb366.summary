@entity1 students are to be offered @entity3 - compliant interest free loans by the government in an attempt to get more @entity1 pupils to go to university			1
since tuition fees were increased in september 2012 , many @entity1 students have been put off continuing their education as it was expected the loans , which are paid back above the rate of inflation , would be used to cover the rising costs - contrary to their beliefs			1
following a four - month consultation , a new sharia - friendly model which involves @entity1 students paying a donation into a pool system instead of paying interest has been produced by the @entity22 ( @entity23 )			1
' it also confirmed that students taking out the loans will pay back exactly the same amount as those who use the traditional scheme , essentially making a charitable donation rather than paying back interest			1
with universities now charging tuition fees of up to £ 9,000 , most students borrow money from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) - taking out loans of up to £ 9,000 to cover their tuition fees and up to £ 4,375 for their maintenance costs			1
while they are studying , the loan carries an interest rate of the @entity60 , currently 2.5per cent , plus 3 per cent , and when paying back the loan the interest rate , based on their income , will be between @entity60 and @entity60 plus 3 per cent			2
once a student is earning a £ 21,000 - a - year salary , repayments are made at a rate of 9per cent of any yearly income over that amount			0
working : instead of paying back interest on their loans , students will make a takaful contribution - which is perceived as a charitable contribution from a @entity3 perspective the need to take out a loan to cover the cost of university led to concerns being raised by many @entity82 that paying it back was incompatible with their beliefs , and the rising fees meant families were unable to fund courses themselves			1
around 20,000 people responded to the consultation document , with 93per cent saying students with religious objections to the charging of interest had been affected by the changes in tuition fees and student loans			1
@entity3 is a moral and religious code which affects everything from a believer ’s personal hygiene to diet and finance			2
in terms of the latter , it prohibits acceptance of specific interest ( known as riba ) or fees for loans of money , whether the payment is fixed or floating			1
to comply with @entity3 , any loan must be @entity112 ( free of profit ) '			0
this therefore excludes student loans , which accrue interest ( albeit , at a very low rate , equivalent to the rate of inflation )			0
there is not a strictly codified uniform set of laws that can be called @entity3			0
it is considered a system of several laws , based on the @entity126 , @entity127 and centuries of debate , interpretation and precedent			0
attempts to implement @entity3 law have been met with opposition globally			0
there is no consensus between @entity1 schools of thought on how far - reaching @entity3 law should be			1
of 1,054 @entity1 students who gave an example of their experiences when completing the survey , 337 said they objected to the interest , and 144 stated they would not go to university as a direct result of requiring an interest bearing loan			1
one said : ' students , including myself , chose to stay at home through their higher education in order to take only the minimal loan necessary to avoid extra interest			0
' most significantly in my opinion , this seriously limits the options of universities that they can apply to as they can only apply to ones within a reasonable commutable distance			0
' this might mean that they miss out on courses only available at specific universities , or miss out on applying for the best universities for their course of interest			0
' this can hinder these students from the best career for themselves that they could possibly have achieved otherwise			0
' the new loans will operate under the @entity3 model of ‘ takaful ’ , a form of @entity1 insurance where people contribute money into a pool system to guarantee other members against loss or damage			1
the fund will be established with an initial sum of money , either donated to the fund or provided as an interest - free loan , and applying for money is expected to be done in a similar way to existing loans			2
students will make a takaful contribution - which is perceived as a charitable donation from a @entity3 perspective			1
bis insist that the scheme will not leave @entity196 students out - of - pocket , as the loan repayments will simply be reinvested into the ‘ pool ’ for future students ’ funds			2
the government worked with @entity1 financial experts to come up with the product , working under the criteria that the repayments and debt levels must be identical to a traditional loan , ensuring that students who took up the alternative scheme would end up no better or worse off than others			1
it was also ruled that repayments should be made directly through the @entity215 tax system , making it as simple to do as for those paying back traditional student loans			2
a spokesman said : ' making higher education more accessible to all is part of government ’s long - term economic plan to boost skills and strengthen growth			0
' the overwhelming response to our consultation has shown the strong demand for a @entity3 - compliant alternative finance model for student loans that everyone can access			2
we support this idea and will now work towards its development			0
' the @entity236 of student money advisers agreed that there is no hard and fast answer to the problem , saying that ' there is a variety of interpretations amongst @entity1 groups as to what would be acceptable under @entity3 requirements			1
' @entity3 is a moral and religious code which affects everything from a believer ’s personal hygiene to finance and diet			0
attempts to implement @entity3 law have been met with opposition globally			0
there is no consensus between @entity1 schools of thought on how far - reaching @entity3 should be .			2

many @entity1 students have been put off university by high tuition fees
fees require students to take out loans , which *conflicts* with their beliefs
new scheme will see students taking money from and paying into a pool
instead of paying interest , students will make a contribution to this fund
the amount is *deemed* to be charitable donation from a @entity3 perspective
they will pay back the same amount as students taking out traditional loans
