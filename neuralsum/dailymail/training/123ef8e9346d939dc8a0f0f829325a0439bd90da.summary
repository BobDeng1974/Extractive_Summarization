a trained terrorist from @entity4 is awaiting orders to carry out an attack on the @entity7 , officials from three @entity2 security agencies have revealed			1
the man is believed to have received terrorist training from @entity11 's offshoot in @entity12 and is ready to strike			1
western intelligence officials have long feared such a scenario - a convert to @entity15 who is trained in terrorist methods and can blend in easily in @entity2 and the @entity18 , traveling without visa restrictions			1
anti-terrorism forces during a training session in a suburb of the @entity12 capital @entity24			2
@entity12 is thought to be a fertile breeding ground for @entity11 officials from three @entity2 security agencies confirmed the man is ' operational , ' meaning he has completed his training and is about to receive a target			1
all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly			2
they declined to name the man , who has not been accused of a crime			1
' we believe he is operational and he is probably about to get his target , ' one security official said			0
' and that target is probably in the @entity7			0
' a security official in a second @entity2 country confirmed the information , adding : ' from what i understand , a specific target has not been established			1
' @entity2 security services , including in @entity4 , have warned in recent years of homegrown , radicalised @entity15 traveling to terror training camps in conflict zones			1
many of the known cases involve young men with family roots in @entity53 countries			0
but the latest case involves a man in his 30s with no immigrant background , the officials said			1
chilling echo : @entity60 , pictured on trial in @entity62 , killed 77 people in a bombing - and - shooting massacre on july 22 after converting to @entity15 in 2008 , he quickly became radicalized and traveled to @entity12 to receive terror training , one of the officials said			1
the man spent ' some months ' in @entity12 and is still believed to be there , he said			1
the official said the man has no criminal record , which would also make him an ideal recruit for @entity11			2
' not even a parking ticket , ' he said			0
' he 's completely clean and he can travel anywhere			0
' the official would not specify what preventive measures were being taken but said ' there is a well - established relationship between @entity81 security services , and they share the information needed to prevent terrorism			0
' @entity85 , the @entity86 citizen accused of trying to blow up an aircraft with explosives in his shoes the officials declined to specify what makes them think the man is operational			1
signs that a would - be jihadist is ready for an attack could include the creation of so - called martyrdom videos for release online in conjunction with an attack , or an abrupt cutoff of communication and contacts with peers to avoid detection			2
the man has not been accused of a crime in @entity4 , where traveling abroad to attend terror training camps is not a crime per se			2
in many @entity2 countries , suspects are not named unless they have been formally charged with a crime			1
@entity12 military officials said they had information on @entity2 training with @entity11 in the southern part of the country but that they were n't aware of a @entity4 being among them			1
they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media			0
@entity123 and @entity124 officials in the @entity18 declined to comment on the @entity126 report			2
@entity127 , a spokesman for @entity4 's @entity129 security service , also declined to comment on the case			0
he referred to a @entity129 security assessment in february , which highlighted that ' several ' @entity15 extremists have traveled from @entity4 to conflict zones to attend training camps			0
@entity127 acknowledged that converts who turn to violent extremism pose a particular challenge			0
' converts will have a different level of cover , especially if they have no criminal record , ' he said , adding that most @entity53 converts do not turn to extremism			0
there are several examples in @entity2 and the @entity18 of converts linked to terror plots , from failed shoe - bomber @entity85 , a @entity86 convert , to a @entity149 woman dubbed ' @entity150 , ' who pleaded guilty last year to charges that she plotted to kill a @entity153 cartoonist who caricatured @entity15 's @entity154			1
@entity4 saw the first convictions under its anti-terror laws this year when two men were given prison terms in january for plotting to attack a @entity160 newspaper that also had caricatured the @entity154			0
in march , @entity161 , a radical @entity162 - born cleric who came to @entity4 as a refugee , was sentenced to five years in prison for making death threats against @entity4 officials and three @entity168 men he claimed had insulted @entity15			2
but @entity4 's most serious attacks happened last year at the hands of a right - wing , @entity173 extremist , @entity60 , who admitted to killing 77 people in a bombing - and - shooting massacre on july 22			0
the self - styled militant 's trial ended last week with conflicting claims about whether he is criminally insane			0
a verdict has been set for august 24 .			0
