dr @entity0 , pictured , is the first doctor to go on trial for @entity2 in the @entity3 the first @entity3 doctor to stand trial accused of female genital mutilation has been made a ‘ scapegoat ’ for his hospital ’s failings , it was claimed			1
dr @entity0 , 32 , is accused of carrying out the potentially deadly procedure on a young mother after helping to deliver her first child at the @entity14 in north @entity15			1
but yesterday , @entity0 ’s defence team argued he had been ‘ hung out to dry ’ and should never have been put in the position he found himself in			2
his lawyer , @entity18 , also questioned the @entity20 ’s decision to bring the case to trial			0
she said the woman , who is known only as @entity24 , should have been identified before the birth as a victim of @entity2 , which the court heard she had first undergone in @entity28			1
this would have meant she was put on a special care ‘ pathway ’ with midwives who are experienced in dealing with such cases			0
but this opportunity was missed , so when she arrived at the hospital in labour in november 2012 , @entity0 had to cut through stitches so the baby could be born			2
he then claims he put a figure - of - eight stitch back in to stop the woman ’s bleeding – but the court heard this procedure amounted to @entity2			1
‘ if @entity24 had followed the @entity2 pathway he would never have been in the situation he found himself in , ’ miss @entity45 said			2
closing her case after two weeks of evidence , she added : ‘ we do suggest that dr @entity0 has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the @entity14 and their failings			1
‘ there was a complete failure to pick up @entity24 as someone who had suffered @entity2			0
that failure by the midwife and hospital is at the root cause of all that has followed			0
‘ she should have been referred to a specialist @entity2 midwife			0
that was a serious failure			0
these are serious , systematic failings , none of which are dr @entity0 ’s fault			1
’ the court heard that the woman had first undergone @entity2 when she was six years old			1
her labia were cut and then stitched together , leaving her at risk of infection			0
she later married and in 2011 , after moving to the @entity3 , she had the procedure reversed and become pregnant			1
@entity45 , defending , told the court her client ' has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the @entity14 ( pictured ) and their failings ' the prosecution claim @entity0 was encouraged to replace her stitches by a second defendant , @entity81 , 41 , who was acting as the woman ’s translator			1
he is on trial alongside @entity0 , accused of encouraging and assisting an offence			2
earlier , prosecutor @entity86 claimed the doctor – who was a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the time – had bowed to pressure from @entity81 and carried out @entity2 by stitching the woman back up to her ‘ pre-delivery state ’			2
making her closing speech to the jury yesterday , miss @entity86 said : ‘ the prosecution case is dr @entity0 , ordinarily a very good , caring and competent doctor , found himself in the position where @entity81 was interfering			1
‘ he kept coming over and insisting that @entity24 ’s anterior incision was repaired so as to put her back in the same situation she was in when she arrived			0
‘ dr @entity0 obeyed the patient ’s wishes , but it was not clinically necessary or therefore connected with the labour and birth			1
‘ he did it the way he did because of mr @entity81 ’s insistence			0
’ however , miss @entity45 insisted her client was not a ‘ quivering and trepidatious ’ doctor who would give in to a patient ’s demands , but an ‘ honourable , honest and ethical man ’			0
@entity0 , of @entity116 , @entity117 , was suspended from his job in march 2014			0
he pleaded not guilty to one count of carrying out @entity2			2
@entity81 has denied aiding and abetting the procedure as well as an alternative count of encouraging and assisting the offence			0
