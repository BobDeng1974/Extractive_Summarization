a newly created suburb in @entity1 has been left without a title when residents rejected naming the area after a respected @entity6 leader , claiming it was n't in line with the suburb 's surroundings and that it needed to be ' anglicised '			1
more than 100 complaints were lodged with @entity12 when the @entity13 made a submission for the suburb , in @entity1 's @entity16 , to be named ' @entity17 ' , after one of the last known leaders of the @entity21 clan			1
@entity22 , a traditional owner of the land and cultural heritage projects officer for @entity25 , said that he had expected the process to be straightforward , but that many in the @entity6 had been very hurt by the public 's reaction			1
@entity22 ( left ) with his father @entity30 , is a traditional owner of the land and cultural heritage projects officer for the @entity13 , worked closely with the naming officer to submit ' @entity17 ' as the new title for the suburb on wednesday night councillors from the @entity39 suburb , 105 kilometers from @entity36 , abandoned the name , amid claims from the public that it was too hard to pronounce or spell , and that it could be confused with other suburbs in @entity44			1
a campaign was launched on @entity46 to encourage residents to propose new names , and to register to speak out at the meeting against the name			1
residents suggested to ' anglicise ' the proposed name , and expressed simply ' not liking ' the name			2
' the majority of objections to the name were around pronunciation and spelling , or that it was too similar to another area where people were saying was potentially an issue for emergencies , ' said @entity64 councillor @entity63			0
' however the name had been given geographical approval , and there is a clause in the guidelines for indigenous names that might hard to pronounce , ' she said			2
' there 's been many different versions for why people do n't want the name , people have changed their reasoning , and many have tried to find loopholes when the name already had approval , ' mr @entity30 said			0
' when the name went out for exhibition there was some misinformation that was leaked to the public , which caused a stir and ended up in a social media frenzy , ' he said			0
on wednesday night councillors from @entity1 abandoned the name , with claims that it was too hard to pronounce or spell , and that it could be confused with other suburbs in @entity44 residents suggested to ' anglicise ' the suggestion of @entity17 , or expressed simply ' not liking ' the name ' there were suggestions for different names , and a lot of them were jokes , such as ' @entity102 ' , which was very hurtful for the community to see			1
' earlier in the week , local @entity106 elder @entity105 claimed that the opposition to the name had been driven by racism , labelling the objections as ' excuses '			1
@entity112 , a local resident , said that the claims of racism were enraging			0
' this is democracy at its best , the overwhelming response was to reject the name @entity17 for more than one reason , ' mr @entity112 told news.com.au			2
' the name of a suburb should be in harmony with its surroundings , i do n’t believe @entity17 is in harmony with the surrounds			1
' mr @entity30 said that mr @entity105 was not a member of the @entity13 , and that the community had stayed away from mentioning racism			0
he said that he had , however , been confronted by the opposition expressed at wednesday night 's meeting , and had been very uncomfortable ' sitting in a room with 100 people and being the only traditional owner of the land			2
' ' when the decision was announced people cheered and jeered and heckled , and while we 've stayed quiet , that behaviour is n't something i 'll be able to forget , ' mr @entity30 said			0
' the name went out to popular vote , and @entity6 only make up a small proportion of the population			2
sitting in that room last night with 100 people showed me how much @entity106 people are still at a disadvantage			1
' ' not much has changed , we have n't moved very far			0
@entity1 prides itself on being the birthplace of democracy , but it does n't work for the @entity106 people , ' he said			2
' in the 1800 's localities down our way were named after head chiefs and leaders of tribes but it has n't happened since then			0
' @entity112 , a local resident , said that the claims of racism were enraging a campaign was launched on @entity46 to encourage residents to propose new names , and to register to speak out at the meeting against the name ' the idea of us paying respect through the name of the suburb and to show we 've moved on from history was a way for us to educate the community about the history of @entity1			1
' members of the @entity46 group suggested paying respects by naming the new ring road in the suburb after @entity17 instead , or using the leaders ' anglicised name of ' @entity182 '			1
' @entity44 names places after settlers and historical people all the time , and there are never problems , but as soon as an @entity106 name comes up people have issues , ' said mr @entity30			1
one member posted that residents were ' getting labeled rednecks and racists for not caving in ... ' , while another said that locals were happy to have an indigenous name , but wanted one which conformed to @entity39 's naming guidelines			0
' the council sent all residents the proposal for renaming the area and asked for suggestions for names by a specific date to which the majority went to being named after ' @entity209 ' which runs through the area , ' posted a resident			1
' we worked closely with the council 's naming officer and we ticked all the boxes , and covered all the guidelines , ' said mr @entity30			0
' when the submission for the name first went to council there was some misinformation that was spread through the media before the meeting , which caused a stir among the community , ' he said			2
one local posted that residents were ' getting labeled rednecks and racists for not caving in ... ' ms @entity63 requested a deferral at wednesday 's meeting because many from the local @entity6 population had not been able to attend , a move which was denied ' the name has historical significance not only for the people of @entity1 , but for people all over @entity44			1
' ms @entity63 said that in the end it probably came down to a number of residents simply not liking the name			0
' personal taste always going to vary , you 're never going to get complete agreement			0
in this case the new suburb already had a small number of residents , perhaps 400 , who may have already had preferences for a name , ' she said			2
ms @entity63 requested a deferral at wednesday 's meeting because many from the local @entity6 population had not been able to attend , a move which was denied			1
' my motion to defer ( based on direct request from @entity1 and district @entity106 co-op ) was in view of the fact that supporters from the affected area , the broader community and indigenous community would not have realised how much weight was given to the views of affected residents , ' said ms @entity63			1
' the majority of councillors voted against deferral , and voted to abandon the name , which means we are back to the start and there will be a full submission process again , ' she said			0
' it 's so disappointing , it would have been so significant to the @entity6 and @entity278 community , and a great gesture of respect and support			1
' ' faced with such opposition it would be hard to not take the decision personally , as the name is from their traditional language , ' she said			0
mr @entity30 said that the clan would ultimately like to have the suburb named what they had suggested			0
' we do n’t currently have native title , all our land was taken from us			0
this has really upset a lot of people on both sides			0
' ' we should be able to move forward and not be anglicised			0

the name was proposed to pay respect to a local @entity106 elder
opponents campaigned on @entity46 , made 100 submissions to council
@entity17 was too hard to say and spell , and too similar to other names
@entity12 rejected the complaints before voting at a public meeting
but councillors backed down at the meeting heavily attended by opponents
@entity6 said they are hurt , but they do not want to label their town racist
the suburb , which already has hundreds of residents , remains *nameless*
