by @entity0 @entity1 has no plans to make major changes to @entity5 's game , but believes she can help him refine his mental approach as he prepares the defence of his @entity10 title			1
@entity1 , the former women 's number one , was named as @entity5 's coach earlier this month , giving her only a couple of weeks to work with the @entity15 before his @entity10 schedule gets under way with a first round clash against @entity19 on monday			1
' his dna is not going to change dramatically , ' @entity1 said in the @entity21 on sunday			2
' maybe i 'm trying to add a few little things here and there , but the timing is difficult			0
' tweaking : @entity1 believes she can help refine @entity27 's mental approach during @entity10 fighting against time : @entity1 has only worked with @entity5 for a few weeks after beoming his coach earlier this month while the short time available is one factor , the @entity30 noted she is not the sort of coach who plans to work on technical details , and will instead take a more philosophical approach			1
' @entity5 knows that , ' she added			2
' we 've talked about this			0
that 's what i did with both @entity44 ( @entity45 ) and @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , more about the game , how to play , but also how to approach it , approach the moment , approach competitions , and , with @entity44 last year , ( how to ) approach the length of the @entity53 - which @entity5 knows pretty well already			1
i 'm not going to invent any fancy new drills or anything			0
' the philosophy @entity1 espouses could hardly be more different , and more laid back , than @entity5 's previous coach , the intense @entity57			1
' it 's tough to compare @entity57 and me , ' she said			2
' we are so different - in every way			2
i think our personalities are very different			0
i do n't know @entity57 very well			0
i know him through @entity5 's eyes			1
i do n't think i will bring him the same as @entity57 , which is good , because @entity57 brought him a lot and maybe i can bring him different things			0
' favourable draw : @entity5 , pictured during sunday 's practice , will face @entity19 in the first round @entity5 's victory at @entity10 last summer ended a 77 - year wait for a @entity74 winner of the men 's title in @entity77			1
@entity1 , a former winner herself , has already seen the difference in @entity5 's approach with the burden lifted			1
' it feels great , i think the pressure is less important now that he 's won last year , ' she said			2
' i would say it 's pure joy			0
of course there is the goal ( of winning again ) and focusing on the game and what to do on the court , and how to be			0
but i feel first of all it 's joy and being so proud to be there to defend the title			0

@entity1 has no plans to make major changes to @entity5 's game
@entity15 's new coach believes she can help 27 - year - old refine mental approach
