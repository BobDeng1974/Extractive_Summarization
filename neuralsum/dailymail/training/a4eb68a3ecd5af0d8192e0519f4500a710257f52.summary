by @entity0 published : 21:24 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 21:24 est , 27 january 2013 gold - plated pensions in the private sector are being shut down ' at the fastest rate on record ' , a report by the @entity2 warns today			1
in 2005 , 43 per cent of ' final salary ' schemes allowed new recruits to a company to join			1
today the figure has collapsed to just 13 per cent following the biggest - ever drop last year			1
a ' final salary ' pension promises to pay a worker a percentage of their earnings on retirement for the rest of their life , and is guaranteed and inflation - proofed , unlike other types of pensions			1
warning : @entity2 chief executive @entity25 has highlighted the pension apartheid in @entity27 as a result , millions of workers face the prospect of working into their 70s and still retiring with a paltry pension , unlike their parents who retired young on a gold - plated deal			1
to make matter worse , soaring numbers are shutting down completely , putting up the ' closed ' sign to existing workers as well as new recruits			2
the report , published today , reveals nearly a third of ' final salary schemes ' have closed to both types of workers , compared to just three per cent in 2008			1
in 2005 , the hygiene firm @entity45 make front page news after axeing its gold - plated pension scheme to existing workers			1
today there is a steady stream of companies deciding to scrap their pension scheme , and replace it with an inferior , cheaper alternative			2
the findings highlight the pensions apartheid in @entity27 as the vast majority of @entity58 workers continue to enjoy a guaranteed , gold - plated pension , unlike those in the private sector			2
@entity25 , chief executive of the @entity2 , said : ' those starting a new job in the private sector have next to no chance of getting a final salary pension			1
what was once the norm is now a very rare offer			0
' and those who are currently saving into one may find it gets closed			0
we are in the midst of a pension regime change			0
' record : the number of new recruits getting final salary pensions is down from 43 per cent to 13 per cent the @entity2 report says the ' record rate ' of closures has been fuelled by the @entity83 's £ 375billion money - printing scheme , known as quantitative easing			1
this has put extreme pressure on pension funds because it has made their liabilities - the pension promises that they have made to their workers - much bigger			0
their liabilities are calculated using the interest paid by @entity96 bonds , known as ' gilts ' , but gilt yields have fallen sharply as a result of the controversial quantitative easing policy			0
the @entity2 said it has prompted ' a barrage of fresh closures			2
' and bosses will continue to close down their pension schemes , according to today 's report , which polled more than 1,000 pension funds with nine million members and assets of £ 628billion			0
over the next five years , nearly half said they are ' planning to close the pension to new staff '			0
the @entity112 estimates around 11 million people in @entity27 have ' inadequate pensions			0
' this means they either do not have a pension , or have a pension which is worth too little to pay for a comfortable retirement			0
since october , new rules forcing bosses to pay into a pension for the first time for their workers , who are automatically signed up to the scheme , are aimed at solving the pensions crisis .			0

only 13 per cent of new recruits at companies will get a ' final salary ' pension
the figure is *dramatically* down from the 43 per cent of new recruits in 2005
