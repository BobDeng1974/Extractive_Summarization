self - assured and poised in her stilettoes and new hairstyle , @entity0 clearly revelled in being centre - stage – addressing a nationwide audience of @entity5 , rather than just the usual five million @entity6			1
such was her exultation that @entity8 , mother of tennis star @entity9 ( who was widely criticised for voicing his support for @entity6 independence on the eve of last year ’s independence referendum ) , tweeted about her triumph			1
@entity8 said : ‘ @entity15 ’ ( @entity16 , set and @entity17 )			0
until now , she had been in the substantial shadow of her noisy and bullish predecessor , @entity27			0
but few north of the border were surprised by her performance			0
the fact is that @entity0 has the most experience of governing of any of the seven politicians taking part in the tv debate , having been a member of the @entity38 and deputy first minister since 2007			1
such is the hero - worship she attracts in @entity6 , that even after the @entity42 lost the referendum vote last year , 12,000 people paid to see her speak at @entity45 ’s @entity44 , a concert venue more usually home to pop stars such as @entity49 or @entity50			1
@entity0 is a very canny operator			1
her style on thursday night was deliberately calm , natural and direct – qualities that are rare in politicians in this age of spin and slipperiness			0
the @entity5 - wide tv audience was clearly impressed			1
an instant poll by @entity21 found that 28 per cent thought she was the best performer			0
fascinatingly , one of the most - searched things on @entity62 immediately after the end of the broadcast was whether people who do n’t live in @entity6 can vote for the @entity42 on may 7			1
as a fellow @entity67 , i wanted to see her do well			0
but as someone who regards himself as ‘ @entity5 ’ and who voted to keep the union , i am all too aware of her determination to destroy my country			1
indeed , @entity75 is a very dangerous woman			1
such was her exultation that @entity8 , mother of tennis star @entity9 , tweeted about her triumph			0
@entity8 said : ‘ @entity15 ’ ( @entity16 , set and @entity17 ) leader : for most people outside @entity6 , this will have been their first proper view of @entity6 ’s first minister although poles apart politically – and @entity0 herself would run the @entity85 in @entity86 at the comparison – she shares many similarities with @entity89			1
like mrs t , the @entity42 leader transformed her image from that of a dowdy egghead into a glamorous , power - dressing imperatrix – emphasising a mixture of elegant feminine charm and steel			1
her strength of character and willpower have driven her to the top of a party that has traditionally been dominated by powerful men in kilts			0
what has lifted her above these male rivals is her emotional intelligence			0
although naturally shy , her two decades in politics has seen her grow into a polished public performer			0
make no mistake , however : she is unequivocally left - wing			0
and she is also an avowed feminist			0
indeed , during her @entity42 conference speech last month she said : ‘ i am determined that – unlike that other woman leader we once knew – i will use my time in this job to improve the lives of women across our country			1
’ one of her first acts as first minister was to create a gender - balanced @entity38			0
first minister @entity0 greets young fans on the campaign trail in @entity86 , where she was hailed as ' @entity6 's @entity124 ' dangerous : @entity42 leader @entity0 could hold the balance of power and be in position to decide who forms the next government having taken over from @entity27 after the @entity42 had lost the referendum , @entity0 is in some ways exactly what @entity6 needed			1
the country was – and still is – deeply divided and bruised by the vote			0
but the beguiling @entity0 is a much more conciliatory and less arrogant figure than her predecessor			2
very cleverly , she is now taking her @entity6 independence campaign south of the border			2
and thursday ’s tv debate offered the perfect platform			1
by saying that her ‘ message to the people of @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 is one of friendship ’ , it was a brazen charm offensive			0
opinion polls suggest that post-may 7 , @entity0 could wield huge influence over who forms the next government in @entity152			2
and with predictions that her @entity42 could take 45 of @entity6 ’s 59 seats , there is a growing fear in @entity143 that she could hold @entity152 to ransom			1
range : @entity0 , leader of the pro-independence @entity42 , was touted as one of the victors			1
analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a ' killer line ' to stand out from the rest by propping up a @entity167 government , she would try to impose her left - wing agenda : big - state socialism , ferocious opposition to an austerity programme , the non-renewal of the @entity175 nuclear deterrent , demands for expensive public spending projects that fly in the face of economic reality			0
if that happens , @entity5 would face a political crisis as the @entity143 ( who number 53million ) would feel justified in rebelling against a government that depended for its existence on the votes of a neighbouring country of just five million			2
such a situation would , inevitably , become unworkable and collapse , with incalculable consequences for our political system			0
of course , that would play right into the hands of @entity0			2
for she full knows that the growing anti-scottish feeling in @entity143 could lead to @entity152 concluding that the union with @entity6 was unsustainable			2
already , @entity6 are speculating that there would soon be a second referendum on independence			2
these are the cards that @entity0 holds – and her hand is stacked with aces			2
the fact is that she commands her party and her nation in a way that @entity207 or @entity167 can only dream of			0
today , @entity0 is the most dangerous woman in @entity5 politics .			1

tv debate was the first proper view of @entity0 for most outside @entity6
@entity42 leader has most experience of governing of politicians who took part
@entity0 is the most dangerous woman in @entity5 politics , writes *columnist*
