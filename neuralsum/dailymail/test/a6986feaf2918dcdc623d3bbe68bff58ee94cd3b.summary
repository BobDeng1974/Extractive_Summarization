you would think it would be a little intimidating			0
but for this tiny chihuahua , having a best friend 120 times his size is proving a great source of comfort			1
the diminutive @entity8 was abandoned on the street next to a set of bins			1
at just over a month old and weighing less than 1lb , he was freezing cold and perilously close to death			1
fortunately , he was rescued by the @entity13 and taken to their @entity15 centre in @entity16 - where he quickly became inseparable from 9st mastiff @entity18			1
@entity8 was rescued by the @entity13 and taken to a centre in @entity16 where the two have quickly become inseparable ' it was as if the little fellow took on @entity18 as his personal minder , ' said centre manager @entity29			1
' @entity8 had to be rescued once by the @entity13 and it seems like he is taking precautions to make sure nothing can happen to him again			2
' @entity8 was found severely dehydrated and cowering between two bins at a block of flats in @entity36 last week			2
but he was revived by the reassuring presence of the mastiff , who eats more than @entity8 's weight in pet food each day			1
@entity42 , @entity13 animal collection officer , said : ' it is so lovely to see he is safe and happy			0
' @entity44 ' : @entity8 was found severely dehydrated and cowering between two bins at a block of flats in @entity36			2
but staff at the @entity13 say he has been revived and come out of his shell after finding @entity18 ' when i first came across @entity22 he was frozen and shaking and had just been left to die			2
he 's really tiny - small enough to fit in the palm of my hand			0
' he seemed to come out of his shell as soon as we arrived at @entity15 and spotted @entity18			0
it really is a love story			0
