labour spending plans will mean tax rises for millions of families , @entity0 claimed today			2
in a speech on the economy , the prime minister said the @entity8 's decision not to support @entity10 spending cuts left voters with a clear choice at the next election - more government spending under @entity15 , but also higher taxes			1
mr @entity0 said : ' if people are happy to be taxed more , fine			2
they can make their decision at the next election			0
but that is the consequence of @entity15 – and the @entity22 people need to know it			1
he said 2015 would be ' a fight for the soul of our country ' , between conservatives bent on slashing public spending to 1930s levels for ideological reasons and a @entity15 offering a ' tough and balanced ' approach which would eliminate the current deficit ' as soon as possible '			1
mr @entity8 insisted a @entity15 government would only borrow to invest in such things as infrastructure			1
but mr @entity0 will warn that this will prevent the eradication of the £ 91billion budget deficit and mean higher taxes for all			1
he said : ' when they say , as they do , that they do n’t support our spending reductions , that they want to spend more - we all know what that means : higher taxes			2
' there is simply no way around this			0
the money ’s got to come from somewhere – and it ’s going to come from you			0
' so that is the choice between sticking to the plan or veering off it : lower taxes or higher taxes			0
' he also warned there would be deeper cuts in the future to pay off the debts in the long term mr @entity0 pointed to analysis by the independent @entity78 that says the plans would let mr @entity8 borrow up to £ 50billion a year			1
the @entity80 have pledged to run a £ 23billion budget surplus by the end of the next parliament , letting ministers begin paying off the national debt			1
mr @entity0 said that beneath the ' jargon ' was a blueprint that would massively increase public borrowing and store up potential crises			1
he said @entity15 's plans would involve increasing the government 's towering debts ' for ever ' - leaving @entity22 vulnerable to a repeat of the 2008 crisis			1
left unchecked , @entity15 's plans will increase the national debt by £ 500billion in two decades - equal to almost £ 30,000 for every tax - paying family - mr @entity0 added			1
@entity8 said 2015 was ' a fight for the soul of our country ' - between the @entity80 bent on slashing spending for ideological reasons and @entity15 which would eliminate the current deficit ' as soon as possible ' ' at the height of the so - called boom years , far from running a surplus , @entity22 was running the biggest structural deficit in the @entity108			1
then , in 2008 , when the economic storms hit , we were completely exposed , ' he warned			0
' our plan is about making sure that does n't happen again			0
it 's about saying that by 2018 we will be putting money aside so that if any crash or shock happens to our economy , we will be better prepared			0
' and frankly , if we are not going to start putting money aside after seven years of continued economic growth , when will we be ? ' experts have warned that the scale of the squeeze required to meet the chancellor 's targets would mean spending cuts ' on a colossal scale '			2
@entity127 wants @entity22 to run a £ 23billion budget surplus by the end of the next parliament @entity131 cabinet minister @entity131 said they would ' destroy public services in this country in the way we know them ' and accused the @entity80 of embarking on an extreme ' ideological ' mission that would spell misery for voters			1
but mr @entity0 insisted the @entity10 plans are ' sensible and reasonable ' compared to the ' reckless ' @entity15 strategy			2
' @entity8 spoke about the deficit - and wrapped it all up in a lot of jargon			2
' he claimed he would run ' a surplus on the current budget ' and attacked our plans to ' balance the overall budget '			0
i want to peel back the jargon and tell you what this actually means			0
' @entity8 is saying he will only balance part of the government 's budget , not the whole thing like we plan			1
' and let 's be clear what that means : @entity8 would never clear the overall , headline budget deficit			1
he would run a budget deficit , permanently adding to debt indefinitely			2
' treasury calculations suggested @entity15 's policy would result over 21 years in a £ 500 billion bigger debt than on @entity10 plans , he will say , £ 30,000 more debt for every taxpaying household in @entity22			1
' that is a great , black , ominous cloud on the horizon and if a real economic storm hit again , the fall - out would be felt by families up and down this country ... ' our plan is about fixing the roof when the sun is shining			0
the alternative is about taking a massive gamble with our future			0
' @entity15 questioned why the chancellor had not - as promised in the @entity187 - yet set out details of legislation enshrining in law a commitment to eliminate the deficit on day - to - day spending by @entity158 departments by 2017 - 18			1
the move was seen as a trap for @entity15 but shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity197 said it was now ' a shambles '			2
' in the @entity199 was talking about a vote on balancing the overall budget			0
then last month the @entity202 tried to lay the ground for a big u-turn by briefing that the vote would only be on balancing the current budget , excluding capital investment			0
' and now , after all the hype and promises that a new charter would have been published over the last week , the government has totally failed to publish anything			0
this is a total mess			0
as ever , these so - called @entity10 traps are backfiring on the chancellor			0
' @entity127 should spend less time playing silly political games and more time sorting out the economy and trying to make his sums add up			0

@entity220 warns @entity8 will leave the @entity22 vulnerable to a repeat of 2008 crisis
@entity15 's plan would increase national debt by £ 500billion in two decades
last week mr @entity8 said he would eliminate deficit ' as soon as possible '
