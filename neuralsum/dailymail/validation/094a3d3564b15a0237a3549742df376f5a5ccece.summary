it has been an annus horribilis for @entity2 clubs in @entity3			1
ten clubs from @entity5 began their @entity7 campaigns last year , with dreams of @entity9 and @entity10			1
but before @entity12 , all have seen them shattered			0
@entity14 qualifier : @entity16 2 - 3 @entity15 ( agg 4 - 5 ) - july 24 , 2014 @entity16 's @entity7 campaign ended before it began with an extra-time defeat in @entity19			1
@entity21 's men led the first - leg tie 2 - 0 but were pegged back at @entity23 , and @entity25 's 113th - minute goal won it for the minnows			2
@entity27 netted for @entity16 but their @entity7 dream was over way back in july at @entity23 @entity14 third qualifying round : @entity31 2 - 3 @entity30 ( agg 2 - 5 ) - august 7 , 2014 after seeing off @entity34 and @entity35 , @entity33 ' side lost 2 - 0 in @entity36 but were on the brink of a famous victory			1
leading 2 - 1 with less than five minutes to go , @entity40 's penalty and @entity42 's late winner stunned @entity43			2
@entity44 holds off @entity45 but @entity31 crashed out of the @entity14 to @entity30 @entity16 's @entity46 ( left ) and @entity31 's @entity47 show the pain of defeat @entity14 qualifier : @entity51 2 - 2 @entity52 - august 28 , 2014 they had waited 110 years for continental competition in @entity51 , but after two ties @entity56 's @entity14 dream was over before the @entity14 group stage had even begun			1
the @entity59 managed a 2 - 1 second leg victory at the @entity61 , but the 1 - 0 defeat a week earlier meant early exile			2
@entity51 fancied their chances against @entity52 but had @entity65 as they exited early @entity14 last 32 : @entity66 lose 3 - 4 @entity67 - february 26 , 2015 @entity69 's side produced a memorable first leg performance against @entity67 , but conceded three away goals in doing so			2
a late @entity73 strike at the @entity74 sent 10 - man @entity66 out of @entity3			0
@entity66 would have struggled even more against @entity67 had it not been for goalkeeper @entity76 @entity51 's @entity77 ( left ) and @entity66 's @entity78 look dejected after their respective losses @entity14 last 32 : @entity80 lose 5 - 4 on penalties to @entity82 – february 26 , 2015 @entity80 started their campaign in the @entity84 , but looked ordinary against @entity82 in the @entity14 round of 32 second leg			0
@entity88 's effort sent to tie into extra-time before @entity90 missed the crucial penalty to condem the @entity92 to defeat in @entity93			0
@entity90 missed the crucial penalty to send @entity82 through @entity14 last 32 : @entity95 3 - 1 @entity94 – february 26 , 2015 the @entity94 faithful had just started to dream of a @entity14 and @entity98 double when goals from @entity101 and @entity102 put paid to another @entity104 exit			0
@entity105 shows his pain after being eliminated in @entity107 @entity84 last 16 : @entity108 2 - 2 @entity109 – march 11 , 2015 @entity108 were the first team in @entity84 history to exit the @entity84 without actually losing a game			1
@entity113 's defensive tactics backfired hugely against an extremely talented @entity109 side , who fought to a 2 - 2 draw after 120 minutes at @entity117			0
@entity118 ( left ) and @entity119 look bemused as 10 - man @entity109 staged a remarkable fightback @entity121 - back at @entity117 - scored as @entity108 failed to beat 10 - man @entity109 @entity84 last 16 : @entity124 3 - 3 @entity123 ( out on away goals ) – march 17 , 2015 the @entity126 had it all to do after a shock 3 - 1 defeat against @entity123 at the @entity130			1
it proved too big a task as goals from @entity134 and @entity135 left @entity124 one goal shy of a place in the @entity84 quarter - finals			1
@entity139 ( right ) ca n't bare to watch after the final whistle in @entity123 @entity84 last 16 : @entity141 1 - 3 @entity142 – march 18 , 2015 the pressure was well and truly on @entity51 and @entity144 after being outplayed by @entity142 at the @entity145 in the first leg			1
things did n't get any better at the @entity148 as a superb performance from @entity150 was the only thing stopping an onslaught from @entity153 @entity154 missed a penalty as @entity141 were dumped out of @entity3 by @entity142 @entity14 last 16 : @entity157 4 - 6 @entity156 – march 19 , 2015 and so , it was left to @entity160 's @entity157 side to pick up the pieces and fly the flag for @entity104 football in @entity3			0
after a 2 - 1 first leg victory against @entity156 at @entity165 , @entity157 were the narrow favourites to go through to the @entity14 last eight and give @entity104 fans something to sing for			0
unfortunately for the @entity157 faithful , @entity157 continued the embarrassing trend of crashing out of @entity3 by succumbing to a 5 - 2 defeat in the @entity172 giving @entity156 a deserved 6 - 4 aggregate success			0
@entity160 's @entity157 were an embarrassment in defeat away at @entity156 on thursday @entity154 ( left ) and @entity176 look crestfallen after @entity141 and @entity157 crashed out of @entity3			0

ten @entity2 teams were involved in @entity7 competition this *season*
some , like @entity108 , had hopes of competing until the *business* end
others , such as @entity31 and @entity16 , *attempted* to *progress* through qualifying rounds
but all have been eliminated before the quarter - final stage
