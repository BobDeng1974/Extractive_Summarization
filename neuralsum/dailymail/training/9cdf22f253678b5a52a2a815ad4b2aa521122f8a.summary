by @entity0 he has a shambolic personal life and a chronic alcohol addiction which would kill a man with less seasoned liver			2
yet despite these foibles , the fictional detective is perfectly capable of cracking even the most fiendishly difficult of crimes			0
now a top police officer has called for authors to put aside the stereotypes exemplified by characters such as @entity13 ’s @entity12 in favour of clean - living coppers who are closer to real life			1
bad example : self destructive @entity12 , played here by @entity20 , is not an accurate description of modern policing , according to chief constable @entity23 @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , right , another television detective depiction @entity23 disagrees with @entity27 and @entity28 chief constable @entity23 also said that the work done by one man in many stories would actually be carried out by a team of 40			1
‘ you see a @entity12 or @entity24 at the scene , recovering forensic exhibits , interviewing the suspect , comforting the family , arguing with the chief constable about resources ’ , he told @entity35			1
‘ what can be a team of 20 , 30 or 40 people is concentrated in the person of this one senior investigator			1
there are some pretty damaged individuals in too many of these books			0
‘ i 'd quite like to see some cheery , well - balanced , well - adjusted , equally successful investigators			2
’ @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , right in prime suspect : another police procedural series in which writers present a flawed detective taking on the job of more than one person chief @entity62 , who was speaking before a talk at @entity65 literary festival , said he accepted that an honest depiction of police procedure would generally put audiences to sleep			1
but the @entity70 winner added that officers had to operate within the law and a @entity12 - style approach to policing was not acceptable			2
some television viewers might disagree with what he ’s saying , but mr @entity23 knows the realities of the modern police force better than most crime writers			1
entering the force in 1988 , he worked considerably on the investigation into the death of princess @entity84 and was awarded the @entity70 in the @entity85 of 2012			0
@entity70 recipient @entity23 , who has come out against the depiction of fictional police detectives and called on crime writers to portray them in a more admirable manner detective inspector @entity91 , created by @entity92 author @entity13 , on the other hand lets his personal and professional issues intertwine and often acts outside the law when making decisions , which would no doubt see him face disciplinary action if he was a real life cop			1
in january a senior detective in @entity99 was found guilty of gross misconduct after failing to read a killer his rights before he was led to two bodies - behaviour that shows striking similarities to @entity13 's fictional character			2
detective superintendent @entity107 should have repeatedly cautioned taxi driver @entity108 as he showed him where two victims , @entity110 , 22 , and @entity111 , 20 , were buried			0
the double confession was inadmissable in court because @entity114 police officer mr @entity107 , 49 , had broken @entity115 ( @entity115 ) rules			0
it was a scene that could have been pulled straight out of a crime novel , but with much more serious consequences for the real life detective			0
' the rules and laws are there for a reason			0
it 's not heroic to step outside the law			0
we should n't do that			0
we 're the police ' , @entity23 said .			1

@entity27 and @entity28 chief constable @entity23 *criticises* stereotypical depiction of detectives as rule - *bending* and self - destructive
believes crime writers are doing a *disservice* to police
work done by one man in many stories would actually be carried out by a team of 40
' an honest depiction of police procedure would generally put audiences to sleep ' , says a chief constable
