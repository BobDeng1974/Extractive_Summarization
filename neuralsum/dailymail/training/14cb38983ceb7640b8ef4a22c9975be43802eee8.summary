by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 08:24 est , 30 may 2012 a cash - strapped @entity2 @entity1 is hoping one of her prized @entity6 paintings will fetch £ 25million at auction so she can ' ease her cash flow situation '			1
baroness @entity9 , who founded the @entity11 art museum bearing her surname , said her country 's recession was ' also affecting collectors '			1
it had forced her , she said , to sell @entity21 painter @entity6 's the lock - finished in 1824 and the last of @entity17 , which includes his famous work @entity20 , to be privately owned			1
for sale : the @entity23 , by @entity21 painter @entity6 , is up for grabs at @entity26 's auction house in @entity27 in july reluctant : baroness @entity9 said she did not want to sell her @entity6 painting ' i need the money , i really need it , i have no liquidity , ' the owner of an art collection worth more than £ 800million told @entity2 reporters in a staggeringly frank admission			1
she added : ' i am very austere with my life , but to maintain the collection requires lots of costs			0
' i have had £ 640million of art work lent for free to the @entity2 state over the last 13 years			2
i did not want to sell this			0
' it has given me a lot of pain to lose this painting , that myself and my husband bought at an auction in 1990 , but if @entity49 chooses i will not have to sell any more			1
' art home : the @entity52 museum is located in the 19th century @entity53 in @entity11 couple : @entity9 ( left ) and her late husband baron @entity55 ( right ) build up a formidable art collection which has become the envy of the world the lock , to be sold at @entity26 's auction house in @entity27 on july 3 , depicts a man operating a wooden canal lock gate in preparation for a boat to pass through			1
a rural church is visible in the distance			0
it was first acquired by 19th century collector @entity68 at the @entity70 ’s summer exhibition in the year it was completed			0
baron @entity72 was one of @entity74 's richest men in the latter half of the 20th century - and following in his father @entity76 's footsteps he became one of the world 's greatest art collectors			1
using wealth generated from the large industrial conglomerate inherited from his father , he preserved and augmented the outstanding collection of @entity86 pictures formed in the 1920s and 1930s			0
he also significantly expanded the range through his own acquisitions , most particularly of the work of @entity92 and @entity93 artists from the 19th and 20th centuries			0
his father ’s collection included masterpieces by @entity92 masters including @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
it was largely displayed at the @entity105 , a 17th century mansion on @entity106 acquired from @entity107 in 1932			0
baron @entity55 added more than 200 paintings , as well acquiring over 900 more modern works which were completely outside his father ’s range of interest			0
as his collection increased in scale , he began to focus on the possibility of finding it a suitable , permanent home			0
in the mid- 1980s , the main body of the collection was placed into a trust and in 1992 the @entity121 was opened in the newly refurbished 19th century @entity53 in @entity11			0
@entity9 - @entity9 shared her now deceased husband ’s passion for collecting and they spent much of their marriage visiting museums , art galleries and auction houses			1
the @entity130 's bought it at auction for £ 10.8million in 1990 - at the time a world record price for any @entity21 work of art. it has since been in the collection at the @entity11 museum - which the couple opened in 1992 in the refurbished 19th century @entity53 after placing their collection into a trust some years before			1
the @entity1 tried to sell it to a @entity21 collector last year for £ 30million , but the deal was never sealed			1
she also tried to negotiate with the @entity2 state , saying : ' i offered it at a special price , to be paid in installments , but we could not reach a deal			0
' she also revealed that the museum has been been hit the country 's economic crisis , with @entity11 recently cancelling its long - standing annual £ 1.75million sponsorship			1
but it is not her most valuable painting , which is the @entity158 by @entity159 , which has been valued at around £ 120million			2
constable himself said of the lock : ' it looks most beautifully silvery , windy and delicious - it is all health - and the absence of everything stagnant , and is wonderfully got together			1
' @entity168 , president of @entity74 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , called the piece ' an outstanding masterpiece of @entity92 art '			0
he said : ' this superb landscape , coming from the same series as @entity20 , represents @entity21 landscape painting at its very best			2
' @entity178 , co-chairman of @entity86 and @entity21 @entity180 , and @entity181 , international director , @entity21 paintings , said : ' the sale of this painting will be a moment of huge significance for the art market , and for that of @entity86 paintings in particular			2
' in 2006 we combined the forces of our old master and early @entity21 paintings departments due to the broadening international appeal for works dependent on their quality , as opposed to the nationality of the artist			2
' since then we have seen @entity21 art reach new heights and have broken records for a number of the greatest @entity21 artists including @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207			2
' we look forward very much to presenting this hugely significant work of art to the world 's leading collectors and museums			2
