' at home and in hospital : when @entity13 's family launched a fundraising campaign to find a cure for the disease nearly a year ago , they said they expected her to lose her ability to speak by her fifth birthday sick : and although the five - year - old can still talk , her father , @entity10 said words do not come as easily to her and she appears to have stopped learning new things			1

@entity16 ( @entity81 ) is a genetic and terminal disorder that affects around one in 70,000 live births			1

although there is no guarantee that the treatment will work - or that @entity13 will get into the clinical trial - her father said he and his family had to try			1
he said the family will remain in isolation until there is progress and admitted the decision had been ' the hardest of our lives			0
