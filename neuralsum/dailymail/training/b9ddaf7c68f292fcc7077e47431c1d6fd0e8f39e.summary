when @entity1 was omitted from the @entity3 squad that drew at @entity4 at the end of august , the official explanation was that he was n’t in the right frame of mind to play in the game			1
a more accurate account is probably that having seemingly been denied his wish of a lucrative move to the @entity14 the previous day , the @entity11 ’s deep displeasure was best kept in isolation for a few days			1
in fairness to the former @entity22 man , his frustration at seeing the road to the south blocked on that occasion has n’t festered			2
even in a @entity3 defence that ’s been alarmingly porous at times this season , he ’s invariably been the stand - out performer			1
@entity3 's @entity11 defender @entity1 was close to a move away from the club in the summer the turn of the year will bring with it another raft of rumours and doubtless one or two concrete bids for his services			1
@entity35 are said to be monitoring the player ’s situation at close quarters but @entity39 or @entity40 look to be more realistic destinations			1
it ’s now a question of where and when rather than if			2
as in the cases of @entity47 and @entity48 , both now domiciled on the south coast , money wo n’t so much as talk as eventually deafen all parties into submission			2
there is potentially a strange quirk in all this , however			2
unless a prospective suitor comes calling in the early weeks of january – and that rarely happens these days – @entity3 might well find themselves fending off bids in the last hours of that month			1
even those living in darkened caves are surely by now aware of the fact there ’s the small matter of an @entity64 semi-final clash at @entity65 the following lunchtime			0
so , irrespective of their overwhelming favourites tag for that game , would @entity3 dare sell their prized asset the night before such a hotly - anticipated fixture – no matter what kind of money is tabled ? @entity14 sides @entity35 , @entity74 and @entity40 are all reportedly interested in the defender alternatively , were they to stand firm again , what frame of mind might @entity76 be in when the team bus pulls up at @entity65 ? given the unpalatable possibilities , it seems likely the powers - that - be at @entity85 will move to head this one off at the pass			1
‘ i ’m sure the manager will already have told him he ’s going nowhere in january , ’ former @entity3 striker @entity87 told @entity88			1
‘ i did n’t take to the manager in the beginning but i now think he ’s someone who ’s got his head screwed on and will see this coming			0
‘ he ’ll be looking at this situation coming up and talking to @entity1 about it			1
@entity97 will be all too aware of it , too			0
i ’m pretty sure they ’ll both be saying : “ you can go – but now until the end of the season			2
” but @entity3 boss @entity103 may be unwilling to sell @entity76 considering the clash with @entity105 ‘ you ca n’t contemplate having someone with their head scrambled the night before such a big game			1
he might not be happy to be told he ’s definitely going nowhere but at least he ’ll have accepted it by the time the game comes around			0
’ @entity87 firmly believes that , regardless of the prospect of the first game with @entity105 in almost three years , there is sound reason for @entity76 seeing out the season in @entity118			1
hard on the heels of the @entity65 clash , @entity122 come to town			0
progression to the last 16 of the @entity125 may be the only thing on anyone ’s mind , but for the @entity11 the tie also represents a casting couch for the @entity14			0
‘ i know there ’s been talk of @entity35 but at this stage i think that ’s ambitious , ’ @entity87 added			1
‘ but , he can still get a really big club - and if he does well against @entity122 then who knows			0
‘ i can tell you for a fact , the @entity138 clubs do n’t care how well players do against other @entity143 teams			0
@entity87 has said @entity76 will have to prove himself in @entity144 if he wants a move to a big club ‘ no disrespect to boys at @entity149 and elsewhere but they just are n’t rated in the wider scheme of things			1
‘ that ’s why the @entity154 games are massive for him			0
unfortunately , although they qualified from their group , @entity3 have not done too well as a team in a lot of the @entity154 games this season			1
‘ to get a move like that , you ’ve got to do well in @entity144			2
that ’s where you are judged			0
it ’s one thing doing well in @entity143 but it ’s @entity144 where the @entity138 clubs will judge you			0
’ for a man who made an art form out of dashing for saturday night shuttles to @entity172 , it might seem somewhat rich to talk about others needing a degree of patience to do likewise			0
nonetheless , @entity87 believes @entity76 remaining in @entity118 until at least the summer will be as beneficial for the individual as it will be lucrative for the club			1
‘ i think it ’s in the boy ’s interests to stay until the end of the season or possibly even for another year			2
he ’d learn so much not just from the @entity122 games but from the @entity105 match as well			0
he ’ll do well to sample matches like those at any @entity138 club			0
@entity87 believes @entity76 will be allowed to leave the club but not until the summer transfer window ‘ everyone is talking up the prospect of him maybe going to one of the big four in @entity138 – i do n’t think he ’s going to get to that level at this stage			1
maybe a @entity74 or a mid-table team is more realistic			1
‘ my advice would be to stay because he ’s learning all the time			0
he ’s so good he sometimes switches off in the @entity143 games so , in a strange way , he does n’t always look as good a player as he is			0
‘ he ’ll learn not to do that as he ’s only young			0
he ’s certainly a very good player but if he ’s got ambitions of going straight to a top four or six team in @entity138 then another season would do him no harm at all			0
‘ i think he will go but i do n’t think he will go in january			2
the summer will suit all parties much better			2

@entity1 was close to a move away from @entity3 in the summer
@entity35 , @entity40 and @entity74 have all shown an interest
but @entity87 does not believes he will end up at the @entity214
@entity87 also questioned whether or not @entity3 would sell in january
