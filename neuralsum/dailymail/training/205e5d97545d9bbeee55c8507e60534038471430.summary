it promised a ‘ fully immersive ’ @entity2 experience , with reindeer , a festive market and , of course , @entity7 ’s grotto			0
but visitors to @entity10 ’s @entity9 found it to be far from magical and barely wintry			1
children were left in tears as they entered a desolate warehouse with cardboard boxes and random material strewn all over the ground			2
many were unhappy that the ‘ grumpy looking ’ @entity7 did not even stay until closing time			0
others complained about the conditions that two reindeer were kept in			2
also among the litany of complaints were claims that the @entity2 market only contained four stalls – while concerns were dismissed by rude staff			0
mother - of - two @entity55 said : ‘ it was truly awful			0
the event was clearly just planned to make as much money as possible			0
they were n’t bothered about the quality of the event			0
’ the organisers of the event at the @entity65 , in @entity66 , were forced to close the event after only 24 hours after visitors said they were ‘ appalled ’ by the experience			1
it comes less than a month after a winter attraction designed by tv presenter @entity71 was closed after just a day			1
families were left stumped by many of the exhibitions in the winter walk , saying it was unclear what the scenes were supposed to represent @entity10 's @entity9 said the event had ' fantastic features ' , but many of the decorations were found to be dirty and deflated there was a three - hour wait to visit @entity7 , who was guarded by another pair of elves who were reportedly incapable of answering basic questions about the event the halls at the @entity91 were empty and families said the fairground rides were overpriced and there were only four stalls the ‘ @entity99 ’ at the @entity100 in @entity101 attracted more than 1,000 complaints about rude staff , a sweary @entity2 and elves that ‘ sat around smoking ’			1
the @entity9 reopened yesterday , with the promise it would be ‘ better than ever ’			1
however , parents and children were still underwhelmed			0
some attempts to improve it had been made – enthusiastic elves who encouraged children to throw paper snowballs , and there was an increase in decorations and fairy lights			2
however , further inside , the attraction appeared to be the same sorry situation described by the parents who walked out in disgust on its first day – including a three - hour wait to see @entity7			1
@entity120 , 32 , from @entity121 , who brought her two - year - old daughter @entity122 to the attraction , said : ‘ i thought we would give it a chance and come and make my own mind up but it ’s really very , very poor			2
‘ i had a vision in my head of a really magical place for kids to come before @entity2 but to be honest it ’s just a bit depressing			0
’ the festive nine hole golf course promised ' twinkling @entity2 lights , fantastic gifts to overcome and even @entity7 himself ' @entity140 and @entity139 , both 34 , who brought their two - year - old son @entity141 said they would be asking for a refund following their visit parents complained that as soon as they walked through the doors into the ' desolate ' space they were hounded to pay for ' extras ' @entity120 , 32 , ( left ) who brought her two - year - old daughter @entity122 and her friend @entity151 , also two , described the attraction as ' depressing '			1
@entity153 , 31 , ( right ) and her daughter @entity154 said they would not be coming back the @entity157 - @entity156 the ' @entity99 ' winter wonderland designed by @entity71 closed after just one day – after rude staff , a sweary @entity2 and elves that ' sat around smoking ' left children in tears			1
more than a thousand parents complained about the experience at the @entity100 in @entity166 , @entity156 , last month which costs upwards of £ 50 for a family of three			1
the attraction was deemed ' tacky ' and ' unsafe ' by families , but it was re-opened after three days of design improvements			1
the ' @entity99 ' winter wonderland in @entity156 , designed by @entity71 , closed after just one day last month @entity175 - @entity174 the @entity176 in north @entity177 was cancelled two days before it was due to open earlier this week			1
former i 'm a celebrity star and singer @entity180 and wife @entity181 were earmarked for the ' star - studded ' opening performance			2
the announcement has left hundreds of families and children disappointed			0
@entity175 - @entity187 a winter wonderland event in @entity187 was cancelled on its second day in december last year after complaints from visitors			1
families had paid up to £ 65 in advance for various attractions at the town 's @entity194 , including meeting @entity7 , ice skating and seeing huskies and reindeer			1
but its @entity200 page was deluged by people angry at what was on offer			0
@entity7 's @entity204 was said to be staffed by young , thin men and an ice rink was described as ' a few plastic sheets '			0
@entity209 - @entity208 two brothers were jailed for misleading thousands of customers at a @entity212 on the @entity214 and @entity208 border			0
@entity215 , 67 , and @entity216 , 60 , ran the @entity209 attraction in 2008 but it closed within days after hundreds of complaints			2
in february 2011 they were found guilty of eight charges of misleading the public			0
two brothers were jailed for misleading thousands of customers at a @entity212 on the @entity214 and @entity208 border where the nativity scene was just a muddy field			0

@entity10 's ' @entity9 ' attraction at the event centre in @entity66 was closed a day after opening
parents complained about rubbish - strewn hallways , creepy mannequins and poorly - constructed exhibitions
organisers re-opened the event today , but apart from an increase in tacky decorations there was ' no change '
families are demanding refunds as they paid up to £ 20 for a ticket and the treatment was ' *unacceptable* '
this is the latest in a line of attractions which failed to impress , including one designed by @entity250 - @entity71
