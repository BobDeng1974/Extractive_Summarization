@entity1 look set to name @entity2 at inside centre for saturday 's opening test against @entity5 after @entity6 lost his race to be fit for the series opener at @entity9			1
@entity11 ' ankle injury prevented him from training on tuesday in the final practice session before head coach @entity13 names his team on wednesday night			0
the @entity15 back has been out since may 3 and his lingering fitness worries offer @entity17 the chance to win a third cap			0
incoming : @entity20 's @entity2 looks set to replace @entity6 for @entity1 against @entity5 crocked : @entity6 is the first choice inside centre but has failed to recover since being injured in may ( right ) chance : @entity2 impressed with two appearances in @entity25 last year but has not played since april 27 @entity1 head into the three - match series with a much depleted squad but they can take heart from their last two performances against the @entity5			1
@entity13 's side beat @entity5 38 - 21 - a record margin - in november 2012 before narrowly losing to the @entity5 30 - 22 at @entity33 last year			0
@entity2 , a rugby league convert , impressed during last summer 's tour to @entity25 but recently fell out of favour at @entity20 and has not played since april 27			1
operating inside the 24 - year is expected to be another player who is fourth choice in his position - @entity40 - bound @entity39			2
the fly - half has been desperately short of form when picked by @entity15 , but he appears to have edged out @entity45 in the triple absence of @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
headache : @entity1 head coach @entity13 is having to pick a side from a much depleted squad in from the cold : @entity45 looks likely to feature on the bench for @entity1 after a fine season for sale @entity1 will otherwise select a familiar backline with @entity59 at scrum - half , @entity61 outside @entity62 at 13 , @entity63 and @entity64 on the wings and @entity66 at full - back			2
the key decision in the forwards concerns who will partner @entity71 in the second row , with @entity74 's line - out expertise likely to see him chosen ahead of the more abrasive @entity75			1
the front row picks itself with @entity77 , who has overcome a knee problem , packing down alongside @entity79 and @entity80			0
in the back row , the trio that finished the @entity83 will almost survive intact with the physicality of @entity86 likely to see him fill the shoes of @entity88 , with @entity89 at openside and @entity91 at @entity92			0
@entity5 also name their 23 on wednesday , with @entity94 in pole position to replace no 8 @entity96 , who has been ruled out with concussion			0
record : @entity1 beat @entity5 38 - 21 in november 2012 but will field a much weakened side at @entity9 glory : @entity1 celebrate beating @entity5 in 2012 but they will be missing key players on saturday			2

@entity1 play @entity5 at @entity9 in first of three matches on saturday
@entity2 likely to win third cap as @entity6 fails to recover from injury
the @entity20 rugby league convert has not played since april 27
@entity1 and @entity5 both set to name their 23 - man squads
@entity39 expected to be named ahead of @entity45 at fly - half
