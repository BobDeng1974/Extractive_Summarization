by @entity0 published : 03:54 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 05:46 est , 22 january 2014 a @entity3 family is moving to @entity4 so they can administer marijuana to their three - year - old epileptic girl , who suffers 50 to 100 seizures a day			1
@entity9 was legalised for recreational use in @entity4 on january 1 this year , but @entity11 and @entity12 , from @entity13 , want to use the drug to help with their daughter @entity16 ’s condition			1
she was diagnosed with a severe and progressive form of epilepsy called @entity20 when she was just six months old – and her seizures can last up to an hour			1
mrs @entity25 told @entity33 : ‘ you ’re living every day on the edge of your seat not knowing if you ’re going to have to rush to the emergency room			1
there is no option to try it			2
it ’s you jump in with both feet and go			2
' she added : ‘ this is not something where my family lives all over the @entity44			2
this is our home , and we ’re pretty much being forced to leave			0
’ mr @entity12 , who 's also father to a seven - year - old daughter and nine - year - old son , said : ‘ it will work , and we have faith in that			1
’ @entity11 and @entity12 hope that medical marijuana will help with @entity16 's condition the @entity25 family wo n't be allowed to move back to @entity3 if @entity16 is given medical marijuana in @entity4 the five members of the @entity25 family will be barred from re-entering @entity3 if they do treat @entity16 with marijuana , as the drug is outlawed there			1
preparation for the marijuana retail market in @entity4 started more than a year ago , soon after voters in 2012 approved the legal pot industry			1
@entity64 has its own version , which is scheduled to open in mid- 2014			0
@entity66 passed a law in december to become the first nation to regulate pot. pot advocates , who had long pushed legalization as an alternative to the lengthy and costly global drug war , had argued it would generate revenue for state coffers and save money in locking up drug offenders			0
@entity79 , a budtender , sets up marijuana products as the @entity82 @entity81 prepared to open for retail sales on january 1 , 2014 still , setting up regulations , taxation and oversight for a drug that 's never been regulated before took some time			1
@entity4 set up an elaborate plant - tracking system to try to keep the drug away from the black market , and regulators set up packaging , labeling and testing requirements , along with potency limits for edible pot. the @entity96 outlined an eight - point slate of priorities for pot regulation , requiring states to keep the drug away from minors , criminal cartels , federal property and other states in order to avoid a federal crackdown			0
pot is still illegal under federal law			0
police in the eight @entity4 towns allowing recreational pot sales stepped up patrols to dispensaries in case of unruly crowds			0
@entity116 placed signs on doors warning fliers they ca n't take the drug home in their suitcases			0
with the additional police patrols , the airport warnings and various other measures , officials hoped they have enough safeguards in place to avoid predictions of public health and safety harm from the opening of the pot shops			0
marijuana has been decriminalized since 1975 in @entity133 , when the state legislature passed a bill making the possession of the drug a $ 100 civil fine - not an arrestable offense			1
in 1996 , @entity133 voters passed a bill that legalized marijuana possession for medical purposes			1
doctors are allowed to prescribe the drug to anyone with certain chronic medical conditions			2
californians with a prescription can obtain an id card that allowed the poses , grown and consume the drug			0
fifty - five percent of voters approved the measure at the time			0
however , voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana .			2

@entity25 , from @entity13 , @entity3 , suffers up to 100 seizures a day
she has been diagnosed with a severe form of epilepsy called @entity20
her parents @entity11 and @entity12 hope medical marijuana will calm the condition
