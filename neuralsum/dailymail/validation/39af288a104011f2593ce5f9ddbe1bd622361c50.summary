the rapper had denied copying instrumental ' @entity10 — on the way ' in his 2013 song ' @entity13 '			1
but he has now agreed to pay 50 per cent of the royalties to the @entity6 pianist and saxophonist , following an 18 - month legal wrangle			0
the song made a staggering $ 16million for producer @entity39 , @entity35 and rapper @entity40 with the family being awarded $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song			2
an attorney for @entity35 and @entity39 has said a decision in favour of @entity36 's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist 's sound			0

out of pocket : musician @entity0 , pictured here at the opening of a club , has agreed to pay @entity6 musician half of royalties from one of his songs the @entity1 musician and record producer only admitted using the music without attribution a few months ago , according to reports			1
speaking last year , the veteran jazz musician said legal proceedings could have been avoided with a phone call			2

' on the other hand i 'm furious because it would have been so simple to clear the sample			0
all it would have needed was a call or an email to the company and i think it would have been relatively cheap			0
