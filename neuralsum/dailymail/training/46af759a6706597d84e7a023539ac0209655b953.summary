by @entity0 published : 17:54 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 4 january 2013 when @entity2 is sworn in on thursday , it will have a very different - and diverse - line up			1
not only will a record - breaking 20 female senators make up the @entity5 , but @entity2 will have a bisexual member , a @entity7 , a @entity8 and two female combat veterans for the first time in history			1
this modern face of @entity2 shows how it is finally taking a stride towards reflecting the country it is voted to represent - and it 's a move the female senators are thrilled about			1
' i ca n't tell you the joy that i feel in my heart to look at these 20 gifted and talented women from two different parties , different zip codes to fill this room , ' sen. @entity17 , @entity18 , told @entity27			0
bottom row , left to right : @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , @entity52 ( @entity18 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , @entity67 ( @entity35 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) ' in all of @entity72 history only 16 women had served			1
now there are 20 of us			0
' as well as making a collective record , many of the women are making history in their own right , such as senator @entity38 , the first woman to be elected as a senator in @entity81			1
the 20 female senators are divided into four @entity83 and 16 are @entity84 , yet the women believe they are more willing to work together than their male counterparts			1
' what i find is with all due deference to our male colleagues , that women 's styles tend to be more collaborative , ' sen. @entity50 , @entity87 , told @entity30			0
diversity : sen. @entity96 , left , is sworn in on thursday , making her the first @entity38 in @entity72 history			1
right , @entity99 , right , has become the first @entity8 congresswoman the first of many : @entity38 , pictured beside her husband @entity103 as she is sworn in by vice president @entity104 on thursday , is the first female senator in @entity81 sen. @entity59 , @entity106 , added that women have a camaraderie which helps with negotiations - something which she says the women are more successful at than the men			1
' i think there 's just a lot of collaboration between the women senators and ... advice and really standing up for each other that you do n't always see with the men , ' she said			0
@entity121 added that , just because the women all get on , it does not mean that they share the same beliefs or do not push for what is best for their constituents			0
' i always push back the idea that there are women 's issues , ' she said			0
' because every issue from war to taxes to education affect women in this country			0
and that 's why the point of having women be represented on all committees and leading many of them is so important			0
' standing strong : @entity72 rep. @entity143 is pictured on thursday			2
she is an active duty veteran representation : @entity145 ( front , 8th from @entity43 ) poses with @entity84 women of the @entity148 on thursday the 20 women elected to the @entity5 : republicans @entity38 , @entity81 @entity50 , @entity151 @entity47 , @entity152 @entity42 , @entity153 @entity84 @entity45 , @entity154 @entity61 , @entity155 @entity53 , @entity156 @entity52 , @entity157 @entity34 , @entity158 @entity44 , @entity159 @entity67 , @entity158 @entity160 , @entity161 @entity40 , @entity162 @entity59 , @entity163 @entity68 , @entity164 @entity55 , @entity165 @entity36 , @entity159 @entity57 , @entity152 @entity65 , @entity166 @entity167 , @entity168 but despite setting a new record , the women are still not satisfied there are enough of them and vow to fight for 30 per cent representation in the @entity5			2
sen. @entity34 , @entity173 , told @entity30 that women are still underrepresented in the @entity5			0
' i think that until we get to 50 , we still have to fight because it 's still a problem , ' @entity34 said			0
' i think that because of this new class and the caliber of the people coming and the quality of the people coming , i think that hopefully in my lifetime - and i really do hope and pray this is the case - we will see 50 per cent			0
' but progress is also underway with religion , with @entity99 becoming the first @entity8 congresswoman and @entity61 becoming the first @entity7 senator			2
it signals a move from a @entity2 where the question has long been which christian denomination candidates are , rather than whether they identify with a religious group			2
former deputy historian for the @entity148 @entity195 told @entity27 there was a notable nod towards religious plurality among the 110th @entity2 , which was elected in 2006			2
a muslim , @entity200 , @entity106 , and two @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , and @entity61 from @entity155 , were elected to the @entity148 that year			0
he explained that ' the @entity148 is a very representative institution by its design , ' so as the country diversifies , ' you expect to see more religious diversity in the @entity148 '			0
and some newly - appointed congresswoman have seen this in action			2
' @entity99 never ran as a @entity8 or thought of the campaign in that way , ' @entity99 campaign spokesman @entity212 told @entity27			0
' however , after her victory there was a huge outpouring of joy and elation from @entity8 throughout @entity72 and even in @entity221			2
so although @entity99 has never seen it as a " victory for @entity8 " , it 's clear that @entity8 in @entity72 now feel less marginalized than they had prior to her election			2
' but @entity99 is also proud to be representing another group - female combat veterans			2
' while i understand all of the interest about my being the first @entity8 elected to @entity2 , i feel that of greater importance is the fact that @entity143 and i will be the first women combat veterans ever to serve in @entity2 in our country 's history , ' she told @entity27			1
' thousands and thousands of women in our armed forces have given their lives and made tremendous sacrifices , so to have the voice of women combat veterans in @entity2 is a very important milestone			0
' another new congresswoman , @entity246 , a @entity247 from @entity248 , has been described as an atheist , but said she simply sees herself as someone who is not part of a religious group			1
she attended @entity253 but left the @entity255 church after she graduated , explaining that , while she has a huge respect for the faith , she does n't believe in the tenets they do			0
@entity246 , and a handful of other non-theists , offer representation to the one in five @entity72 who say they have no religious affiliation , according to the @entity265			1
girl talk : @entity30 , left in the foreground , sat down with nearly all of the female senators of the 113th @entity2 party lines : the 20 female senators are divided into four @entity83 and 16 democrats the 36 - year - old is also standing out as the first openly bisexual member of @entity2 in history			1
she joins six openly gay and lesbian members in the most demographically diverse @entity2 in @entity72 history			1
senator @entity45 , @entity277 , became the @entity5 's first openly gay member			1
' @entity281 @entity72 have finally broken through a glass ceiling that held firm for more than two centuries , ' @entity279 , president of the @entity280 , said in an email to supporters			1
among the openly gay members of @entity2 - all of whom are @entity84 - one , @entity154 congressman @entity289 , is married , while another , @entity161 's @entity291 , is raising three children with his partner of 20 years			1
making history : vice president @entity104 administers the @entity295 to sen. @entity45 , the first openly gay senator and the first woman senator to @entity154 paving the way : @entity246 is the first openly bisexual congresswoman and is a non-theist ' today @entity281 @entity72 gained powerful , authentic voices on @entity301 who will fight for true equality for all , and @entity2 became more representative of our country , ' said @entity307			1
' we could not be more proud of these seven exceptional men and women			0
