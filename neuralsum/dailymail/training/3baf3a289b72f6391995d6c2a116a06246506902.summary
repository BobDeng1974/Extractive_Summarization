click here for all the best facts and stats with our fantastic @entity4 service , including @entity7 's goal and so the improbable journey continues			1
@entity9 needed favours to reach the @entity12 finals , now they are looking increasingly like a team nobody will want to play			0
had it not been for a late goal scored by the @entity16 against @entity17 last october , @entity9 would have missed out but they have taken full advantage of that good fortune and sailed into the knockout stages last night with an exhilarating 3 - 1 win over 10 - man @entity23			1
setting the tone was @entity26 , @entity9 ’s most decorated footballer , who scored a captain ’s goal midway through the second half of a tense encounter to tee up a last - 16 clash with @entity32			1
@entity7 settled matters shortly after with a fine finish after a rapid counter-attack against a @entity23 side who lost their discipline when @entity39 was sent - off for a late challenge			1
@entity9 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity65 7 ; @entity66 7 , @entity26 8 , @entity67 7 , @entity68 7 ; @entity69 5.5 ( @entity50 62min , 6 ) , @entity70 6 , @entity7 6.5 ( @entity71 84 ) , @entity72 6 ( @entity73 79 ) ; @entity74 6 , @entity75 6			1
booked : @entity26 , @entity75			0
man of the match : @entity26			0
referee : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) 6			0
given what was at stake and the small margins separating these nations in @entity86 , the contest was spiky and feisty almost from the first whistle , with players from both sides testing the patience of referee @entity79			0
cynical fouls prevented the game from developing a rhythm and @entity23 ’s problems were exacerbated by the system @entity9 played , with their three central defenders — marshalled supremely by the veteran @entity26 — not allowing @entity23 ’s forwards to flourish			2
@entity60 was also nullified , meaning @entity63 and @entity62 barely got a sight of @entity65 ’s goal			0
more worrying for @entity23 , the longer the half went on , the more @entity9 clambered on top and they came closest to breaking the deadlock through @entity67			2
when the ball dropped to him 25 yards out , he only had one thought on his mind and he caught his shot flush , sending a left - foot drive fizzing past @entity23 keeper @entity51			2
much to @entity67 ’s frustration , though , his effort cannoned off the crossbar			0
roared on by a partisan crowd in @entity116 , @entity9 started to ask more and more questions of @entity23 and their finish to the first period was strong but they were unable to find a way past @entity51 , who stood firm when @entity68 had a chance in the 41st minute			2
delight : @entity9 's @entity26 celebrates scoring his side 's first goal flashpoint : referee @entity79 separates @entity9 's @entity7 ( right ) and @entity23 's @entity58 @entity75 of @entity9 and @entity59 of @entity23 compete for the ball @entity128 9 @entity129 8 @entity130 7 @entity131 4 @entity132 3 @entity133 3 @entity134 3 @entity135 3 @entity136 3 a similar pattern ensued after the restart			1
@entity60 , belatedly , started to have an influence and forced a corner with one jinking run and shot but still @entity9 would not be moved , as @entity26 — a @entity143 winner in his prime with @entity130 — would not let their defence lose focus			0
that was crucial as in the last 25 minutes , they ran riot			0
@entity26 set them on the way with a header to break @entity23 ’s spirit , @entity7 secured the victory with a thumping finish shortly after and then substitute @entity50 raised hopes of actually winning @entity86 with another header			1
@entity160 ’s goal for @entity161 in @entity162 , coupled with a consolation strike from @entity61 , ended that prospect but it is clear @entity9 have the potential to make the most of this unexpected opportunity			2
poacher : @entity9 's @entity50 heads home his side 's third goal , making sure of their progress jumping for joy : @entity67 celebrates with @entity74 after @entity50 scored the third goal for @entity9 @entity175 : @entity67 celebrates after @entity7 scored @entity9 's side 's second goal consolation : @entity23 's @entity61 fires home late on , the first goal conceded by @entity9 in group stage			1

@entity26 set them on their way with second - half header
@entity7 added second with *clinical* finish three minutes later
@entity50 made it 3 - 0 with close - range header
@entity61 scored late consolation for @entity23
@entity23 's @entity39 was sent - off for a late challenge
