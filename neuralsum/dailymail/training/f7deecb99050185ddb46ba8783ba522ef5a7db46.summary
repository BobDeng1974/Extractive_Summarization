by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:08 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 02:11 est , 18 march 2014 a family turned a run - of - the mill @entity6 painting into a valuable masterpiece from the @entity9 – after the detail of a woman ’s shoe caught their eye			1
for although @entity15 ’s in @entity16 once assessed the work as being by an unknown artist , closer examination of the shoe of a maid in the picture suggested the hand of an acclaimed painter who had depicted very similar footwear before			0
buoyed by the shoe clue , @entity28 and @entity29 and their son @entity26 then scoured galleries across the world , before poring over the wooden frame of the picture			0
the shoes in the work , now known to be by @entity37 , right , are very similar to those in his other paintings , left they were delighted to confirm their hunch was right by discovering their chief suspect ’s signature tucked away out of sight			1
now the painting – by @entity37 , who famously depicted @entity49 at work during the crimean war – is on sale for £ 180,000			1
the ‘ @entity54 ’ case began when the @entity29 family , who own a gallery in @entity57 , @entity58 , two years ago snapped up the dirt - covered picture of an elegant @entity61 lady being dressed by two servants in @entity63 , for £ 9,000			0
the oil painting had some years before been described by a @entity15 ’s expert as merely ‘ circle of @entity67 ’ , meaning it was believed to be by a student or imitator of the @entity72 painter best known as the designer of the first @entity75 card			0
but the @entity76 had a hunch the apparently unsigned picture was the work of another @entity6 painter , @entity37 , whose most notable painting , @entity49 receiving the wounded at @entity83 , depicts @entity49 in the field hospital at @entity83 during the @entity9			1
@entity85 thought the shoe on the protruding and ‘ slightly stumpy ’ left foot of the maid on the right of the picture looked familiar			1
and painstaking research revealed that , as the @entity76 had vaguely recalled , @entity37 had used a strikingly similar design , and shape of shoe in at least one other painting			1
they decided the clincher was the shoe in @entity37 ’s ‘ @entity99 assisting @entity100 on her flight from @entity102 ’			2
@entity103 said : ‘ it was the same type of shoe , with an unusual rosette decoration , as in another of @entity37 ’s paintings			2
’ that confirmation of the shoe clue was giant step in the right direction - but it took another six months of detective work , mainly by @entity103 , to get the case nailed down			0
when the painting was taken to @entity15 , it was attributed to an unknown artist and valued at £ 9,000 the research involved the @entity120 in @entity121 , the @entity122 and @entity123 in @entity16 , and @entity37 ’s home town of @entity125 to make absolutely sure			1
ultimately , the @entity76 were delighted to discover the clincher had been there unnoticed all the time			0
finally they found @entity37 ’s signature hidden out of sight under the frame at the back - and it matched a similarly hidden signature on a @entity37 painting kept , but not displayed , in @entity134			1
this was the final proof - the picture was @entity37 ’s long - lost work @entity139 in @entity63 , based on the artist ’s visit to @entity83 when he prepared sketches for his @entity49 oil and also @entity146 @entity145 ’s @entity144 to her @entity147 , now both in the @entity122			1
@entity139 is remembered for her 18th century letters , particularly from @entity63 , where she was wife to the @entity72 ambassador , and also as a pioneer of inoculation against smallpox , of which she had been a victim			0
the cleaned - up canvas will next week be on sale at the prestigious @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity16 , which starts on wednesday ( march 19 ) , with an enhanced price tag of £ 180,000			0
the long - lost painting was exhibited at the @entity160 in 1858 and the elderly woman whose family had owned it for decades took it to @entity15 ’s for appraisal in 1990 when it was attributed to ‘ circle of @entity67 ’			2
but thanks to the low price suggested was not put up for sale in 2012 , attributed as @entity15 ’s had suggested earlier , and was duly bought by the @entity76 for £ 9,000			0
@entity103 said : ‘ it is every art dealer ’s dream to come across something like this			0
‘ it did n’t look much in the saleroom but there were tell - tale signs it was the missing part of @entity37 ’s trilogy - and we were proved right			2

@entity182 found painting worth 20 times what they thought
picture turns out to be lost @entity37 masterpiece
they were tipped off by the similarity of the shoes to @entity37 *'s* other works
