by @entity0 revealed : @entity1 had a role in the 1984 massacre at the @entity4 in @entity5 , pictured @entity6 pleaded with the @entity8 community to forgive the @entity9 last night after an inquiry found the @entity12 government advised @entity13 on how to attack a @entity8 temple			1
he ordered the inquiry by cabinet secretary sir @entity16 after papers released under the 30 - year rule exposed the @entity1 role last month			2
it found that an @entity22 officer was sent to brief the @entity13 army in 1984 on launching a surprise special forces dawn raid against the @entity4 in @entity5 , which had been seized by @entity8 rebels			1
but the advice was ignored and @entity28 ’s government instead launched a frontal assault – codenamed @entity30 - which became a massacre in which up to 3,000 people were killed			0
foreign secretary @entity33 told @entity34 the @entity22 advice had a ‘ limited impact ’ on the raid , which led to an official death toll of 575 and claims that 3,000 people perished in the crossfire , and that there was ‘ no record ’ of the @entity1 government receiving advance notice of the operation			1
he told @entity34 the @entity22 assessment ‘ made clear that a military operation should only be put into effect as a last resort ’ and recommended that any military operation use ‘ an element of surprise and the use of helicopter - borne forces in the interest of reducing casualties and bringing about a swift resolution ’			0
but @entity1 @entity8 last night voiced concerns , demanding a full public inquiry			1
@entity60 , of the @entity61 @entity1 , said @entity1 ’s involvement was clear , adding : ‘ we are actually very disappointed with the announcement today			0
’ mr @entity6 said he wanted the dialogue between the government and the @entity8 community to continue , adding : ‘ @entity1 @entity8 have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life			2
alliance : @entity6 visited the temple last year , and @entity8 in @entity1 form a key bloc vote for the @entity9 ' thirty years ago , a great tragedy unfolded ... in @entity5			1
many lives were lost and the scars in the @entity8 community still run deep			0
‘ i tasked the cabinet secretary with getting to the truth			0
he did so , and there are two main findings			0
‘ one : around four months before the events , at the request of the @entity83 , a single @entity1 military officer provided some advice			0
but critically , this advice was not followed , and it was a one - off			0
anger : lord @entity88 said mr @entity33 's statement was ' smug and condescending ' ‘ two : there is absolutely no evidence of @entity93 involvement in the operation itself			1
’ the prime minister travelled to @entity5 last year to visit the temple - a trip that appeared to have led to a rise in @entity100 support among @entity1 sikhs , who are a key voting bloc in marginal constituencies in @entity104 and the @entity105			1
his efforts are seen by many to have been dashed by the new revelations			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity109 said ' serious questions ' remained , adding : ‘ the pain and suffering still felt by many about the tragic events of 1984 places a particular duty on the government to provide what answers it can to address very genuine concerns			0
’ lord @entity88 , director of the @entity119 , called mr @entity33 ’s statement ‘ smug and condescending ’ and said the language in the documents was ‘ insulting ’ to @entity8 since it suggested they were all extremists			2
on the claim that @entity1 advice had a ‘ limited impact ’ of the @entity4 attack , lord @entity60 said : ‘ it is like saying that i had only a minimal involvement in a massacre or a holocaust			1
’ @entity131 , director of the @entity132 , which represents @entity8 professionals in the @entity1 , said the information disclosed in the review ‘ harks back to colonial times ’			2
he added : ‘ i think there are lots of people in the @entity8 community who are upset that the @entity1 could be involved in this , even to a limited extent			1

inquiry finds @entity1 advised @entity13 on attacking @entity4 in @entity5
the temple had been seized by @entity8 rebels in 1984 , *prompting* @entity149 action
massacre killed at least 575 and some claim crossfire killed 3,000 more
@entity8 attack @entity33 's *insistence* that @entity1 's role was ' limited '
