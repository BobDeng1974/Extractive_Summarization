’ @entity0 , author of ‘ @entity50 ’ , replied he had ‘ no objection ’ to the order			2
in april 2012 , just as preparations for the @entity10 were entering their final phase , @entity0 contacted @entity55 , the principal private secretary to @entity13			1
he told mr @entity55 that spies from ‘ a covert and rather sinister ’ @entity8 agency had sabotaged @entity59 submarine @entity60 , which sank in 2000 , and stole four nuclear warheads			1
the lawyer boasted of ‘ credible @entity64 sources ’ , name - dropped members of parliament , and said intelligence had been blocked through official channels because the @entity8 had infiltrated @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
during the 20 - minute call @entity0 said he had gathered intelligence from his own network of volunteers that one warhead was being stored in a hospital in @entity16 to avoid detection			1

the following day @entity0 phoned the @entity83 and asked to speak with mp @entity84 about the threat , which he described as being in the style of @entity88 tv show ' 24 '			2
the call was reported to a colleague at @entity2 , and @entity0 was arrested the same day			1
@entity0 called a close colleague of then defence secretary @entity13 to say @entity8 spies had looted four nuclear warheads from a sunken @entity59 sub and were hiding one in @entity16 for the attack @entity0 claimed his arrest was a ‘ colossal cock - up ’ , blamed the @entity8 and demanded a ‘ nice lunch with @entity68 ’			1

giving evidence he boasted of meeting prince @entity13 twice in a social context and claimed to have to @entity140 's phone number			0
@entity0 said the information had been blocked through official channels because the @entity8 had infiltrated @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 ( pictured , the queen at the @entity10 opening ceremony ) among his other claims were that he was consulted by the makers of tv show spooks on his specialist knowledge , that the @entity120 had allowed him to enter the @entity88 carrying a weapon , and that the @entity151 's @entity150 had discussed terror attacks with him over a cup of coffee			1
he also insisted he has the authority to issue a @entity156 on behalf of the government to stop @entity159 media from publishing stories that could compromise national security			0
he said he wanted to prevent the @entity162 from blowing his intelligence , and added they were ‘ very cooperative ’			0
@entity0 told jurors that there had been an assassination attempt against him by the @entity124 authorities who wanted to ‘ whack ’ him			0
in response , prosecutor @entity171 said : ' the information was extraordinary and dramatic , in essence mr @entity0 announced that a nuclear weapon stolen from the sunken @entity59 submarine the @entity60 a number of years ago , that such a nuclear weapon had been smuggled into the @entity159 and was being stored in a @entity16 hospital in preparation to be used during the @entity81			1
‘ with the benefit of hindsight the information may seem outlandish , perhaps even laughable			0
‘ before being too dismissive do recall the position in 2012 when those calls were made			0
’ sitting at @entity25 , judge @entity35 delayed sentencing for @entity186 until february next year while the lawyer has psychiatric tests at that stage , surface to air missiles had just been installed on the tops of a number of blocks of flats and it was feared terrorists could infiltrate @entity198 staff after the security company began frantically hiring after announcing a staff shortage , the court heard			1
mr @entity171 said @entity0 was a ‘ respected professional man ’ who has ‘ superficial plausibility ’			0
he added : ‘ it is the prosecution ’s case that the information provided by mr @entity0 was false and that when he communicated those threats he did n’t honestly or genuinely believe that they were true or rather knew or believed that they were false			2
