predecessor ? @entity1 , widely considered to be a direct ancestor to humans , never co-existed with modern man , researchers believe scientists have thrown doubt on a key theory of human evolution after discovering an ancestor of modern man may have become extinct earlier than previously thought			1
homo erectus was widely considered to be a direct ancestor of our own species homo sapiens			1
the two were believed to have once co-existed alongside each other - until now			1
@entity1 migrated out of @entity17 around 1.8million years ago			0
by around 500,000 years ago it had vanished from @entity17 and much of @entity19 and was , until now , thought to have survived in @entity20 until as recently as 35,000 years ago			1
early modern humans reached the region about 40,000 years ago , and so were believed to have co-existed with their ancestors			2
the new research suggests this assumption was wrong - and @entity1 disappeared long before the arrival of @entity27 in @entity19			1
new excavations and dating analysis indicate that @entity1 was extinct by at least 143,000 years ago , and perhaps more than 550,000 years ago			0
if this is the case , it challenges the widely accepted ' @entity33 ' hypothesis which holds that modern humans became fully evolved in @entity17 before emigrating to other parts of the world			0
the model predicts an overlap between @entity27 and older species they replaced outside @entity17			2
the late survival of @entity1 in @entity20 had previously been held up as evidence supporting the theory			0
dr @entity43 , from @entity44 in @entity20 , who co-led the investigations at two sites on @entity20 's @entity47 , said : ' @entity1 probably did not share habitats with modern humans			0
' an alternative ' multi-regional ' hypothesis proposes that modern humans evolved from ancestor species in @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity52			2
the research is published in the online journal @entity55 .			0

homo erectus was thought to have co-existed alongside @entity27 in @entity19 for 5,000 years
but scientists now believe it disappeared from @entity19 at least *100,000* years before arrival of homo sapiens
new evidence supports ' multi-regional ' hypothesis
