by @entity0 published : 14:17 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 17:52 est , 7 november 2012 the @entity1 faces a bitter battle with high - profile stars over plans to add more than 100 broadcasters to the staff books to end suspicions of tax avoidance			1
they are currently paid via controversial ‘ personal service companies ’ which the corporation yesterday admitted give individuals a ‘ greater opportunity ’ to reduce their tax liability			1
figures released yesterday in a review of how the @entity1 pays its stars show that at least 124 top names earn £ 150,000 or more via the companies			1
another 54 freelance stars receive a similar amount			0
some of the @entity1 's highest earners , reportedly including @entity23 , left , and @entity24 , right , have been employed by the corporation on a freelance basis as @entity27 the @entity1 has now identified 131 employees – either currently paid via the service companies or on freelance contracts – who will be asked to go on the payroll and taxed at source			1
this could mean stars such as @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity36 are told to become employees			1
both miss @entity23 and @entity24 have said they were told by bosses to set up the companies in order to receive their salaries			1
last night a leading agent for @entity1 talent said performers , with backing from their accountants , would fight being put on staff			0
the agent said many would be able to prove they earn a large proportion of their money through after - dinner speaking , corporate work , writing and appearances outside the @entity1			0
in addition , it emerged the @entity1 could end up having to increase some stars ’ pay to make up for the change in circumstances			1
currently , people paid through service companies are allowed to deduct up to five per cent in management expenses in calculating their tax liabilities			1
the shake - up comes after months of the @entity1 defending its tax arrangements , in the face of increasing anger from mps who said using the companies generated a suspicion of ‘ complicity ’ in tax avoidance			2
the review – ordered by the @entity75 and carried out by accountancy firm @entity76 – was critical of ‘ weaknesses ’ and ‘ inconsistency ’ in the @entity1 ’s approach			0
other staff working for the @entity1 in a @entity27 arrangement are reported to include @entity36 , right and @entity82 , pictured left			2
it pointed out that staff with similar jobs were being paid in three different ways : some as staff , some as freelancers and others via the controversial companies			0
yesterday the corporation said if someone ‘ displays the characteristics ’ of being a staff member , he or she would have to go on the payroll			0
this means presenters and actors will be subjected to an employment test , which will look at the proportion of income earned at the @entity1 , their ‘ length of engagement ’ , certainty of work provided by the @entity1 and the extent to which the corporation ‘ exercises control ’ over them			2
the @entity1 ’s chief finance officer @entity114 indicated that if about 70 to 80 per cent of someone ’s income was at the corporation it would be likely they would be regarded as staff			2
after the employment test is applied to the highest earners it will then be broadened to include all workers			0
the working arrangements of more than 800 ' on air ' stars at the @entity1 will be urgently reviewed the review found ‘ no evidence of a @entity1 policy to engage with tax / national insurance avoidance ’			2
but it said about one in six of the 804 people paid more than £ 50,000 a year via ‘ personal service companies ’ or who were self - employed , should be given traditional employment contracts			1
the review also predicted use of these service companies would become ‘ considerably fewer than at present ’			1
when asked if the corporation would force reluctant stars on to staff contracts , @entity75 member @entity138 said there would be ‘ no exceptions ’			0
he said : ‘ if someone clearly has the characteristics of being an employee ... there will not be exceptions because someone is a big talent			0
’ yesterday the @entity1 ’s talent managers contacted around 45 of its stars to take them through the details of the new arrangements			0
senior @entity1 insiders have predicted difficult conversations with stars who are reluctant to be put back on staff .			0

the move follows criticism last month of the corporation 's use of payments to personal service companies
some of the stars currently ' self employed ' at the @entity1 include @entity24 and *newsreader* @entity23
