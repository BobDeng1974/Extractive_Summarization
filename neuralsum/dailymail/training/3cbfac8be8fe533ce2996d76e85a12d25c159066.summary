it does n't seem that long since @entity2 's capitulation at @entity3 last april signalled the end of @entity6 ' unhappy tenure at @entity2			1
now , as @entity3 prepare to visit @entity8 on sunday , it is perhaps time for @entity10 's new @entity2 team to reveal its true self			1
such has been the scale and speed of change since that awful day on @entity15 less than six months ago that only two players selected by @entity6 at @entity18 - @entity17 and @entity19 - can expect to start on sunday			2
six members of the 18 , meanwhile , no longer play for the club			0
it has been a remarkable period at @entity8			0
a club for which stability became a byword during sir @entity26 's years has perhaps not seen a time like it since the great @entity28 himself arrived in the mid- 1980s and began dismantling what he believed had become a glorified social club under @entity32			0
it is time for @entity10 's team to start showing the ' philosophy ' he has spoken about @entity2 's last game against @entity3 was @entity6 ' last match in charge @entity6 ( right ) replaced sir @entity26 ( left ) in the @entity2 hot seat but only lasted 10 months in charge @entity10 has a top heavy team with a wealth of talent in attacking positions , but lacking in defensive options on his arrival this summer , new @entity2 manager @entity10 asked for a little time			1
three months , he said , and , though we are not at that self - imposed deadline yet , it is perhaps time that we began to see a little more of a ' philosophy ' that @entity10 often talks about but has thus far not been convincingly revealed by his team 's football			1
to look at @entity2 's first team these days is to look upon a forward line that can look as though it has been hewn from a fantasy football league			2
they can play like that , too , even if this weekend 's line - up will miss @entity59 through suspension and @entity61 through injury			1
@entity2 's first game post-transfer window was at home to @entity65			2
initially a game scheduled to feature supporter protests about a lack of spending , @entity2 's late flurry of august spending was ultimately reflected by a 4 - 0 victory featuring cameos from @entity74 and @entity75			1
elsewhere in their squad , though , @entity2 still look paper thin , especially at centre half			0
this has been reflected in a startling 5 - 3 defeat at @entity81 ( that sentence still does n't sound right ) and a 2 - 1 home win over @entity84 that began vibrantly and ended with nerves shredded			0
captain @entity59 will miss out after he was sent off against @entity84 on saturday @entity61 ( left ) will also miss out with a broken rib but 19 - year - old @entity87 ( right ) will start his second successive first - team game it 's this contrast between performances that @entity10 has not yet managed to reconcile			1
@entity2 can look a completely different team within the space one match , never mind one week , and the reasons for this go deeper than an injury crisis that once more found @entity10 scrabbling around for fit defenders at @entity98 on friday			1
for all the technical quality of @entity2 's offensive players – @entity61 in particular looks a fine footballer – @entity2 continue to have difficulties retaining possession for long periods			2
@entity26 used to talk about suffocating opponents with possession but that trait began to slip away during his later years and it 's problem that went on to afflict @entity108 and is now causing difficulties for @entity10			2
against @entity84 , for example , @entity2 were already beginning to pedal backwards prior to @entity59 's sending off after an hour			1
a team that can look as devastating as any when it moves forward still spends too much time without the ball , despite the endless passing drills that @entity10 asks his coaches to organise on a daily basis during first ream training			0
a very uncharacteristic @entity2 performance against @entity81 saw @entity10 's side lose 5 - 3 having lead 3 - 1 @entity2 players look dejected as the @entity123 lose to @entity81 at the @entity124 ' i do n't know when we will see a total of 90 minutes [ good football ] from the team , ' said @entity10 on friday			1
' you never know because it 's a question of time			0
' you will see for example in the first half against @entity65 , also in the first half in the last match , very attacking and creative football but i want to improve that we do n't lose the ball so easily			0
' that is our problem , not our defence			0
' we are too easily losing the ball			0
' that is the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline			0
' so we are looking for a balance in attacking football without thinking too much in only attacking but also guarding			0
' perhaps @entity2 's venerable coach will not be able to fix this issue until another transfer window or two has passed			2
maybe the return of @entity155 will help on the other side of the forthcoming international break			0
whatever the case , with @entity3 's visit on sunday followed by games against @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , it would appear that @entity2 's @entity166 season is about to begin in earnest			1
@entity10 comes up against @entity3 's @entity168 this sunday at @entity8			1

@entity10 , 63 , set himself a deadline of three months for @entity2 to be playing with his philosophy
so far @entity2 have n't shown any signs of the @entity175 's philosophy
@entity10 has a top - heavy side with @entity178 , @entity59 and @entity75 *upfront*
but his defence is lacking with 19 - year - old @entity87 *filling* in
