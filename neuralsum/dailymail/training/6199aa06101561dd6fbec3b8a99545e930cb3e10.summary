by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a massive political row has erupted in @entity4 after the country singer @entity5 pulled out of a massive comeback special in @entity7 this month			1
the top - selling @entity9 singer cancelled a sold - out run at @entity7 's @entity12 stadium after city chiefs granted permission for just three out of the five planned gigs			1
@entity17 @entity16 described @entity5 decision to pull out as a ' shock to the system ' that will damage @entity4 's slow economic recovery			1
comeback : @entity5 , who quit touring 13 years ago , has pulled out of a massive comeback gig in @entity12 stadium in @entity7 after the council refused to give for permission for two of the five planned dates the gigs were expected to draw 400,000 fans to the @entity4 capital and pump millions into the local economy , which was plunged into a deep recession by the 2008 financial crisis			1
@entity5 , who turned his back on touring to raise his family in @entity37 13 years ago , had issued an all - or - nothing ultimatum last week , saying he would play the five nights or none at all			1
the star said to choose one show over another ' would be like asking to choose one child over another '			2
mr @entity16 said a feud over the gigs , which pitted @entity48 ministers , tourism chiefs , business leaders and city representatives against each other , was ' very badly handled all round '			1
' but there is a planning process in place , which is the law , and that planning process allowed for three concerts , ' he added			2
he said the pull - out would cost @entity7 's economy in the region of a quarter of a billion euros			1
' it 's a shock to the system in terms of the economy of this city and the reputation of our country and i do hope that these kind of issues can be more efficiently handled on the next occasion that they arise , ' he said			0
the political fall - out comes as the @entity76 revealed that @entity5 would not have made a cent playing just three @entity12 gigs			1
the country music legend decided to pump the profits from the first three concerts into a spectacular production to ensure his @entity4 fans would experience a once - in - a - lifetime sensation			1
and when he was told last week - just three weeks before the date of the first concert - that @entity89 manager @entity88 had scrapped two of the dates , it was too late to alter the show 's dynamics which had been tailored to suit @entity12			1
' @entity94 ' : the gigs were expected to draw 400,000 fans to the @entity4 capital and pump millions into the local economy , which was plunged into a deep recession by the 2008 financial crisis last night , while @entity103 was preparing for the nightmare scenario of refunding the ticket price to 400,000 fans , @entity102 was still hopeful that the government would adopt its @entity107 in a bid to save all five gigs			1
and as the bodies involved in the fiasco exchanged accusations , a wellplaced source explained that playing three dates was simply not ' financially viable ' , for the musician			2
' when @entity5 was told that there was going to be five dates , he decided to pump money into the production for the live shows , ' said the source			1
' every cent that he would have made from the first three nights was ploughed straight into the staging , the lighting and the rigging			1
he had ordered graphics and custom - built screens			0
it was going to be a show of a lifetime and all 400,000 fans were going to see something special			1
' this would have really put @entity4 and @entity5 on the map but sadly now that wo n't happen			1
he is not a charity and for these gigs to have made money , he would have had to play the five dates ' ' this has nothing to do with greed for @entity5			1
this has to do with a decision he made to put on a series of concerts that would have been unrivalled in the history of country music			2
' this would have really put @entity4 and @entity5 on the map but sadly now that wo n't happen			1
he is not a charity and for these gigs to have made money , he would have had to play the five dates			1
' @entity155 blocked two of the concerts last week because of an agreement between the stadium owners , the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) , and local residents about how many major music events can take place a year			2
the resulting row - which has dominated the national airwaves - prompted frantic efforts by lord mayor @entity167 to relocate the two gigs , while state arbitrators attempted to negotiate compromises between all sides			0
during the fiasco a split emerged among residents			0
a solicitor for some lodged papers in the @entity178 demanding the remaining shows be cancelled while at the same time another group from the neighbourhood handed a petition to the city manager appealing for all five shows to go ahead			0
a crisis meeting of the city council on tuesday heard claims @entity5 was preparing to divert a ship containing equipment for the stage , which former junior minister @entity191 said was akin to ' putting a gun ' to the lord mayor 's head			1
according to another well - placed source , @entity5 was going to use @entity12 as a benchmark for a world tour : no dates have been planned for this , although @entity5 planned to hold an online press conference tomorrow			1
there had been widespread speculation it would be a platform for the announcement			0
but the sources said : ' he will not be announcing a tour on thursday			0
i can tell you that @entity5 is devastated by this decision			1
the show he was about to unveil in @entity7 would have made music history and now it will never see the light of day			1
' this is not a show that can simply be moved to another location			0
there are no more dates and the rig wo n't fit another stadium			2
i wo n't say that @entity5 will never come back to @entity7 , he loves @entity4 and loves the hundreds of thousands of his fans that bought tickets and fought for the gigs to go ahead			1
but it will take a long time for the wounds to heal			0
' show promoter @entity226 has already described the scale of the production that was being created by @entity5 's design team in @entity9			1
he said they were scheduled to start work on the massive production in @entity12 next saturday , for the first gig on july 25			2
they were putting 22 truckloads of equipment into the @entity238 , ' with lighting and sound effects to create this one - off show '			0
he added : ' all the customised pieces of video equipment that he 's bringing in , we ca n't strip that down and then move to another venue			0
' ' @entity12 needs and wants @entity5 ' : during the fiasco a split emerged among residents living near the site meanwhile , chief executive of the @entity252 , who was brought in to hammer out a deal between those residents who opposed the concerts and @entity12 , has revealed that he had been extremely close to finding a solution when @entity155 announced it was only allowing three concerts			1
he said : ' i thought i had got close enough to it , in terms of addressing 99 per cent of the concerns of everybody , including the residents			2
there was a small group of people i felt no matter what you did , were n't going to be satisfied			0
not welcome : @entity271 @entity270 was among the locals furious that @entity155 has refused permission for two of the gigs ' but then the @entity276 made his decision and , despite all the efforts afterwards , the prospect of getting @entity5 to the country was n't going to materialise			1
' he added : ' i do n't know if we will ever see @entity5 performing in the country again			2
the artist himself , from what i understand , is personally very upset			0
some people may take joy in the fact that he 's not coming but i do n't think the country does			0
i think it 's a problem for the country in terms of how we are seen in the tourist market and the concert market , nobody wins			0
' the @entity160 has said it was not given any indication that a licence was likely to be refused for any of the five concerts			0
representatives said , in a statement , they had engaged fully with council officials and addressed every issue presented during the planning process			2
' at no stage were we given any indication that a licence was likely to be refused for any of the five concerts , ' it said			0
the @entity160 made clear that it accepted mr @entity313 's report			2
it added : ' the gaa is very encouraged by the emergence in recent days of groups of residents in the @entity12 area who share our wish for a positive continuing engagement with the @entity12 stadium ; we look forward to working with them			2
' @entity155 said it was ' very disappointed ' at the decision by @entity325 not to proceed with the three @entity5 concerts that had been licensed for @entity12			1
' @entity327 has sympathy for ticket holders who purchased tickets for the performances			0
@entity155 hopes that @entity325 will reconsider its decision			0
once again , we would like to reiterate that @entity155 granted a licence for three concerts			0
' but @entity337 told the mail last night that nobody would be more upset than @entity226 that the shows have been scrapped			0
and he called on @entity17 @entity16 to rescue the situation			2
' i know @entity226 and he 's one of the best promoters in the business , and respected worldwide , ' he said			0
' he 's best friends with @entity5 , and his manager			2
i 've never seen him so excited as when he booked these gigs			0
this was very personal to him and his family			0
' @entity103 said that it is working on a plan to make the ticket return process as simple as possible , and it will be outlined today			0
last night mr @entity226 defended the singer for ' sticking by his principles '			0
' it 's the right decision			0
we are devastated , it was going to be the biggest musical event , there will never be another artist in my lifetime that 's going to do 400,000 tickets and i do n't know where the position is with @entity5 coming back to @entity4			1
there will be flak , you 'll take flak , i 'll take the flak but it 's the right decision			0
he is devastated , he 's down for millions in this deal , if it was any other artist maybe they 'd say let 's play the three and recoup some money			0

400,000 fans were expected to travel to @entity12 to see the star
