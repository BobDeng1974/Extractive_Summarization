@entity0 makes ' look at me ' bathing suits – the sort of thing that celebrities turn to when they want to get noticed on the beach			1
her boutiques are not , you might imagine , the first place a woman would visit when shopping for swimwear after a mastectomy			2
well , that 's set to change			0
later this month , @entity0 unveils a characteristically sexy range designed with the unique needs of post-breast cancer surgery patients in mind			1
and if the reaction already generated on social media is anything to go by , it 's going to be a hit			0
@entity24 presenter @entity23 is the face of the range , which is raising money for the charity @entity27			1
the 49 - year - old ex-gymnast , who bravely spoke about her brush with breast cancer in these pages last year , has been photographed wearing the costumes – and looks stunning			1
' but i wanted to do it because of the fact i do n't look as perfect as many of @entity0 's other models			2
it 's better that i 'm up there with my normal lumps and bumps because this is what a woman looks like			0
' @entity23 discovered a tumour in her right breast in december 2013 and underwent a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction a month later			2
she also had chemotherapy and is currently clear of cancer			2
' i had a reconstruction using animal tissue and a small implant , so there is very little scarring , ' she says			0
the 49 - year - old ex-gymnast , who bravely spoke about her brush with breast cancer in these pages last year , has been photographed wearing the costumes – and looks stunning ' you 'd probably not be able to tell unless you looked closely – i think i just look like i have pretty good boobs for a woman who 's had three children			1
but still i would n't wear a very low - cut bikini top as you 'd see the scars			2
you might have one or both breasts removed			0
some women do n't have an immediate reconstruction			0
some ca n't and some choose not to			0
' @entity0 first pondered the difficulties women face after her sister @entity80 needed a mastectomy a decade ago			1
' it 's especially hard if you have one breast , ' she says			0
' the only option to make things look even is an insert , but it 's so difficult to get these to look natural next to the real breast			0
we 've worked really hard on finding the right weights of fabrics and padding			0
' the designs are made from a soft microfibre fabric and there are no seams or wiring			1
' they look like my usual designs , but have a little bit more fabric here and there , ' adds @entity0			1
' they 're cut a bit higher on the chest , and they have slightly wider shoulder straps as often women are left with scars there too from the surgery			2
' one woman who has welcomed the range is life coach @entity118 , who was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer in 2011 , aged 47 , and underwent a mastectomy the following year			1
@entity23 discovered a tumour in her right breast in december 2013 and underwent a mastectomy , pictured with @entity0 ( right ) the author , whose book cancer is my teacher was serialised in @entity128 last year , says : ' i have always loved swimming and was depressed after my mastectomy to find the bathing costumes available for women like me seemed … well , let 's call them functional at best			1
' a friend jokes that when she wore hers , she 'd often look down to see one of her breasts sitting somewhere around her midriff			0
@entity0 's designs work brilliantly , and are stunning			1
' @entity23 , who tested a couple of the designs on holiday in @entity144 over @entity145 , admits she would never have posed in a swimsuit had she not had cancer , but says she felt ' liberated ' by the modelling experience			1
' i hope women who might be where i was a year ago – coming to terms with a diagnosis of cancer and facing surgery , worrying that they will be mutilated – will see them and think , yes , there is hope			1
' @entity157 will be launched at @entity158 's on february 10 , and will be available at @entity159 from march			0
all swimsuits cost £ 150 and proceeds go to @entity27			0
the designs are made from a soft microfibre fabric and there are no seams or wiring in the grand scheme of things , whether or not a woman with cancer can buy a fancy designer bikini might seem low on the list of priorities			1
but part of recovery from cancer is learning to feel normal again			2
as @entity118 points out on this page , just because she 's had a mastectomy does n't mean she wants to start shopping for clothes from medical catalogues			0
right from her diagnosis , @entity23 approached her breast cancer with a wonderfully positive mental attitude			1
but she also spoke openly of her fears of losing her hair , and her breasts ( both of which she did ) – of appearing to be ' a cancer victim ' to the outside world			0
she 's better now , and most importantly at this point , she looks it too .			0
