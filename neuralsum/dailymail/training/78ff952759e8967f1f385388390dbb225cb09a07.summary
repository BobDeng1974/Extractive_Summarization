in 2010 the @entity45 and @entity46 of the @entity19 ruled that although it might be an obscene swearword in the @entity48 language , in @entity11 it was simply the name of the village - and a light ' hell ' type of beer			2
they said in a statement that it had rejected a complaint that the trade mark ' @entity58 ' was upsetting , accusatory and derogatory			0
they added : ' the word combination claimed contains no semantic indication that could refer to a certain person or group of persons			0
' nor does it incite a particular act			0
it can not even be understood as an instruction that the reader should go to hell			0
