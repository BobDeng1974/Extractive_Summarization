he took his photo around 1am this morning and incredibly managed to get the colourful @entity27 in the picture too @entity59 , @entity61 magazine : ' the @entity3 meteor shower - while not as strong as the @entity63 , which were visible earlier on in the year - are still a worthwhile meteor shower to watch especially since it can offer up a sudden burst in meteor rate			1
' in general , the lyrids usually peak at ten meteors per hour but one of these unpredictable bursts could mean that you ’ll see anywhere up to 100 meteors per hour			2
' these sudden bursts are fairly unpredictable , so you really need to wait and see if this shower will offer up any surprises this year ! ' the @entity3 are active through to 25 april , although activity would have weakened by then , but it is possible to catch stray meteors over the next few nights			1
' @entity81 ( @entity81 ) is the source of the @entity3 meteors			2
' @entity84 crosses the orbital path of the comet and bits of rock and ice that @entity81 sheds smash into our planet ’s upper atmosphere at around 110,000 mph ( 177,000 km / h )			0
' those " shooting stars " that you see are debris being vaporised			0
' this picture by @entity14 shows the @entity3 meteor at @entity17 in @entity18 in the early hours of this morning another picture by @entity14 shows lyrid meteors at @entity17 in @entity18 the strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour			1
but in 1982 @entity106 counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour			1
this year was particularly good for the @entity3 as the moon was a waxing crescent and was n't in the way			2
the lyrids occur when @entity84 passes through debris left by @entity81 , which orbits the solar system every 415 years			0
the meteors are sand - like particles and leave luminous streaks across the sky as they burn up in the atmosphere			0
they are most active in the night sky between april 16 and 25 , peaking this week			1
the meteor shower is visible around the world but best seen from @entity7			2
several meteors are visible here this year was particularly good for the lyrids as the moon was a waxing crescent and was n't in the way @entity129 captured this stunning picture of the @entity3 meteor shower above @entity132 in @entity133 last night			1
' i was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor , which was amazing , ' said mr @entity129 , 50 , who works as a meteorologist @entity138 , meteorologist with forecasting service @entity140 , said : ' with high pressure dominating the weather this week , much of the [ @entity4 ] has seen clear skies , providing perfect viewing conditions for the meteor shower			1
' dr @entity146 , an astronomer from the @entity147 , @entity148 in @entity149 , added : ' the best place to see the @entity3 is to find an open field where you can see the whole of the night sky			2
the best time is a few hours after midnight where you can expect to see most of the bright streaks in the early hours of the morning			0
' scan the sky over the course of the night as the meteors can pop out from any direction			0

photographers in the @entity4 captured the @entity3 meteor shower in the sky last night
it occurs every year around 16 to 25 april , so you can still catch some meteors *tonight* and *tomorrow*
the strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than 20 meteors an hour
but in 1982 @entity106 counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour
