@entity6 , 57 , former @entity13 chief executive of the @entity10 bank , who has been found dead along with his wife @entity16 ( right ) , 57 , and daughter @entity17 , 22 , at their home in the @entity13 town of @entity21 it followed the bank 's collapse , takeover by @entity3 and subsequent nationalisation			1
police in the @entity13 said they visited his house in the wealthy commuter town of @entity21 , east of @entity31 , early on saturday after being alerted by a family friend			0
there they found his body along with those of his 57 - year - old wife @entity16 and 22 - year - old younger daughter @entity17			0
a police spokeswoman said an investigation was underway but that all early clues pointed to a family drama having taken place			0
there was no indication that @entity6 's business dealings had played any role in the tragedy			2
the daily @entity49 said the three were found by @entity6 's elder daughter who had come to visit before departing for @entity52 , where she had been due to do an internship			1
happier times : @entity16 and @entity56 are pictured together family tragedy : @entity56 , 22 , daughter of @entity6 the elder daughter was in the care of wider family and the police victim care unit , police spokeswoman @entity58 said			2
@entity6 paved the way for @entity10 's break - up and sale in 2007 to a consortium of the banks @entity3 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
after they came into difficulties during the global financial crisis , the @entity13 government nationalised the core @entity13 operations of @entity10			2
when he left the bank after its nationalisation in 2008 , @entity6 was contractually due a 16 million euro pay - off , a sum that was halved after then finance minister @entity78 described it as ' exorbitant '			1
a spokesman for @entity10 told @entity81 : ' we are all very shocked			0
' @entity6 , who ran the domestic operations of the @entity13 bank @entity10 between 2003 and 2007 , has been found dead along with his wife and daughter			1
the bank 's @entity88 hq is pictured here a man walks past a @entity3 logo in the entrance hall of the company 's offices in central @entity88 for @entity3 - and the world economy - the deal to take over @entity10 was a calamity			1
in 2007 @entity3 , led by the then sir @entity98 , was on its way to becoming the world 's biggest bank , with assets of £ 1.9 trillion			2
but following the deal to buy up parts of @entity10 , in a 73.3 billion euro ( $ 100.5 billion ) deal with @entity68 and @entity69 , the shaky foundations on which the the @entity3 financial monster was built started to emerge			0
at the time the deal was the biggest banking takeover in history , but it quickly turned into a disaster			0
not only was it concluded at an inflated price after a hostile bidding process , but just as the world economy teetered on the edge of the great recession			0
then @entity115 went out of business			0
that earthquake triggered a financial tsunami which went on to flatten @entity3 , which had to be rescued by taxpayers 12 months later at the cost of £ 45.2 billion			0
five years on a @entity122 report - titled ' the @entity124 ' ’s report into the failure of @entity3 ' - concluded that the @entity124 should and could have intervened in the doomed takeover			0
@entity98 , the bank ’s former chief executive , was stripped of his knighthood in 2012 , but has never been censured by the regulator as a result of @entity3 's collapse			0
much of @entity10 's operations had to be split out to reform it following the collapse and in 2012 @entity3 ' sold ' back to the @entity13 lender parts of its businesses originally acquired in 2007			1
selling the @entity13 business continued @entity3 's rapid downsizing of its global banking and markets arm to restructure the bank and focus it more on @entity143 retail and commercial banking .			2
