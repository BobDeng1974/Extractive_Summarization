a slimming advert featuring former @entity1 star @entity1 has been banned after a watchdog said her two - stone weight loss in two months was too fast			1
the 56 - year - old 's before and after photos sparked a complaint to the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) after they featured in a social media campaign for diet firm @entity9			0
today ms @entity1 hit out at the ruling - and said watchdog officials ' need to get out more '			1
' it sparked a complaint which challenged whether the ad complied with rules on weight - loss advertising , which say a loss of more than two pounds a week can be unhealthy			0
ms @entity1 's weight loss was around four and a half pounds a week			1
the @entity7 said claims of exact weight loss had to be ' must be compatible with good medical and nutritional practice '			1
backlash : ms @entity1 said officials needed to ' get out more ' and her weight loss was totally healthy so it banned the advert from appearing in the same form again , despite acknowledging ms @entity1 had faced potential health problems from being overweight			1
' we understood that @entity1 had been classed as overweight when her weight loss programme began and also that her waist circumference was very high , which put her at high risk of health problems , ' the ruling said			0
' however , the code specified that for those who were normally overweight , a rate of weight loss greater than 2lb a week was unlikely to be compatible with good medical and nutritional practice			1
' while we understood that @entity9 had given an account of the actual rate of weight loss experienced by ms @entity1 , we noted the rate advertised was greater than 2lb per week			1
' we had not seen evidence to demonstrate that the rate of loss experienced by ms @entity1 was compatible with code requirements			2
' we told @entity9 to ensure that rates of weight loss were compatible with good medical and nutritional practice and that treatments for obesity were not advertised to the public without suitably qualified supervision			2
' the actress hit out at the ruling , saying : ' the @entity7 people need to get out more			0
' weight loss companies are trying to help people , and yet they are n't even allowed to tell us what they can do for us			0
' and @entity9 has been prevented from using my weight loss before and after photos as the @entity7 says i lost weight too quickly			2
how can that be right , when the @entity84 comply with all the nutritional rules , including @entity86 , and i did exactly what i was supposed to do with them			0
' i felt better than i had for ages , and those are genuine before and after pictures			0
' meanwhile obesity is increasing [ and ] people are dying from cancer , heart disease and diabetes			0
' in its submissions to the @entity7 , @entity9 said ms @entity1 's weight loss was in line with expected results for those on a very low calorie diet ( @entity104 ) programme			1
a spokesman for @entity9 said ms @entity1 had eaten more than 600 calories a day to meet guidelines it added that while the rate was greater than 2lb a week , this did not mean that it was incompatible with good practice			1
ms @entity1 also ate more than 600 calories a day , in accordance with guidelines by the @entity114 ( @entity114 )			2
@entity9 medical director dr @entity115 said : ' this shows just why @entity117 is in its current mess , with one of the biggest obesity problems on the planet			0
' there is something wrong when weight loss companies are trying to help dieters , and bureaucracy gets in the way			0
