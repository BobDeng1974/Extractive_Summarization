disgraced : @entity0 has been stripped of his @entity1 after it was revealed he helped to write his own citation an officer who was awarded one of @entity6 ’s most coveted gallantry medals for his bravery in @entity8 has been stripped of it after he exaggerated his heroism			1
it is the first time the @entity12 has rescinded a gallantry medal issued to a serviceman and the case could undermine confidence in the awards system in the armed forces			2
major @entity19 had been accused of taking credit for others ’ bravery after @entity25 gunmen ambushed a convoy in @entity27 in 2008			1
@entity0 was awarded the @entity1 for dodging bullets and inspiring @entity8 troops to fire rockets at the enemy			1
but a five - year investigation by defence chiefs concluded he helped to write the medal citation			1
as a result , the medal will be withdrawn in a decision due to be announced by the @entity38 – the journal which publishes official notices			1
former army major @entity41 told the @entity42 : ‘ it raises questions on the whole awards process			2
‘ it is good to hear that the @entity46 has come clean and withdrawn his award			2
nothing annoys a soldier more than people getting awards that they are not entitled to			0
’ @entity0 , through his lawyers , said he had had ‘ no role in corroborating events referred to in the citation ’ and said there were ‘ shortcomings and irregularities ’ in the process used by senior officers			1
he also said a report had found there had been ‘ no attempt ’ to check the facts with any of the @entity46 personnel			2
gallantry awards are subject to several checks			0
when a soldier performs an act of bravery on operations , the most superior officer present normally drafts a citation			1
he or she would speak to all of those present at the action , and they may even speak to the subject themselves to ask what they did – without letting them know they are writing a citation			2
according to a guide on @entity89 in the armed forces , the subject of a citation should not know their name has been put forward			0
under no circumstance should they have any part in writing their own citation			0
the ‘ theatre ’ commander in charge then assesses citations			0
the @entity102 has his say , followed by the @entity105 ’s @entity104			0
their findings are then looked at by the @entity107 and submitted by the defence secretary to the queen			0
last night a defence source told the @entity42 : ‘ everyone in the @entity46 , especially all those who have been awarded gallantry medals for selfless acts of bravery , will appreciate this robust action			1
' the threshold for @entity6 gallantry awards is exceptionally high and this announcement ensures their achievements are not undermined			0
’ in 2008 , @entity0 , 41 , was a @entity121 officer attached to the 1st @entity123 battle group in @entity27			1
a mixed @entity6 and @entity8 convoy came under attack from the @entity25 , allegedly with roadside bombs , rocket - propelled grenades and machine guns			1
his citation praised his ‘ swift , instinctive actions , personal courage and disregard for his own life ’ , and stated : ‘ as a result of his calm leadership under fire losses were prevented and the lives of those injured were saved			1
’ he was awarded the @entity1 in 2009 ‘ for his consistent bravery and inspirational leadership ’			1
dismissed : @entity0 arrives at his court martial in 2012 where he admitted four charges of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline but upon announcement of the award in spring 2009 , it is understood fellow soldiers in the ambush disputed the claims			1
two corporals were reported to have claimed there was no hostile fire by the @entity25 when a vehicle in their convoy was blown up			1
the @entity161 reported at the time that the officer who made the initial complaint felt aggrieved that actions attributed to @entity0 were those of other officers			2
a junior officer lodged a formal complaint and @entity46 chiefs then called in the @entity170 of the @entity171			0
separately , the commander of @entity6 ’s @entity173 , brigadier @entity174 , was ordered to carry out a review into the citation			0
it is understood that he described the @entity123 ’s performance in handling citations as ‘ dysfunctional ’			0
he found significant disparities between what @entity0 claimed had happened and what actually occurred and that the citation contained a number of falsehoods			1
lieutenant colonel @entity187 , commanding officer of the @entity188 , was arrested and interviewed over claims he had failed to check facts in @entity0 ’s citation			1
by this time @entity0 had been posted to @entity193 headquarters in @entity194 , @entity195			2
it was there , two months after the announcement of his award , that he was arrested			0
when the @entity171 examined his personal computer – to see if he had indeed written himself up for the @entity1 – they found instead that he had illegally stored almost 160 classified documents			0
a search of his quarters uncovered an inoperative automatic pistol , more than 270 rounds of ammunition and a morphine injector			0
in february 2012 he appeared before a court martial in @entity210 , @entity211 , and admitted four charges of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline			0
he was dismissed and handed a year ’s imprisonment suspended for two years			1
brigadier @entity174 ’s report , and that of the @entity170 , was sent through the chain of command to the @entity104			0
the committee is chaired by the @entity223 , rear admiral @entity224 , who is responsible for liaison between the @entity12 and the forces			0
he briefed her majesty on the recommendation and the @entity12 signed the rescinding order			0
@entity0 is believed to have declined to appeal and offered to voluntarily decline the award , provided there was no publicity			2
the @entity105 said it could ‘ confirm that an investigation has concluded into the circumstances surrounding the award of a gallantry medal relating to an incident in @entity8			2

major @entity19 handed medal after @entity25 ambush in 2008
awarded it ' for his consistent bravery and inspirational leadership ' under fire
however investigation was launched after fellow soldiers *labelled* him a fraud
five - year probe found @entity0 had helped write his own citation
was dismissed from service in 2012 and has now had his medal withdrawn
