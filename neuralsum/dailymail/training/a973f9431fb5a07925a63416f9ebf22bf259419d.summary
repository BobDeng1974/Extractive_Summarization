some families of the men he died alongside are suing the @entity7 over the killings , a situation @entity2 describes as ' embarrassing ' the widow of a @entity12 soldier who was one of six military policemen murdered in @entity14 has condemned relatives of the victims for attempting to claim compensation			1
@entity18 , whose 30 - year - old husband corporal @entity19 was killed ten years ago , said the group legal action against the @entity7 for negligence was ‘ wrong and embarrassing ’			1
she said : ‘ i have nothing against these family members and we have all grieved together , but i do find this embarrassing and i have told them so			0
’ @entity27 was one of the six policemen , known as @entity29 , who died when 250 protesters stormed a building in @entity33 , @entity35 province , on june 24 , 2003			1
lawyers representing the families are now suing the @entity7 after the @entity38 ruled earlier this year that such claims for negligence could go ahead			2
but @entity2 , 41 , said the claim is unfair on the 750 families of @entity12 troops killed in @entity14 and @entity44 who have coped silently			1
@entity2 , of @entity46 , @entity47 , who is raising her and @entity19 ’s daughter @entity49 , 11 , said : ‘ it was war and everything goes wrong in war – @entity19 knew that			2
‘ that is the same for so many deaths in both wars			0
what will happen if the families of all these soldiers bring claims ? the situation would get ridiculous			2
i want fairness and less negativity			0
’ solicitor @entity64 , who is acting for the relatives , said the claim , which may be funded by legal aid , would allege negligence to equip the @entity29 properly under @entity69 of the @entity70			0
an inquest into the death of @entity19 and the other @entity29 – @entity74 - @entity73 , 41 , @entity75 , 24 , @entity76 , 23 , @entity77 , 20 and @entity78 , 21 – reached a verdict of unlawful death but failed to condemn @entity82 commanders for their actions			0
corporal @entity1 , 30 , was killed alongside five other @entity85 officers when a 400 - strong mob descended on a police station in @entity33 in @entity14 in june 2003			1

@entity18 lost her husband in *country* *'s* *restive* @entity35 province in 2003
@entity93 and six others were murdered by @entity14 mob
she has *blasted* families who are suing over deaths
they claim the soldiers were not *backed* up and were ill - equipped
but she called claims ' embarrassing ' adding : ' everything goes wrong in war '
