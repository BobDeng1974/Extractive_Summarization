talk about down - sizing : @entity16 @entity15 holds up one of the dolls house in the collection owned by @entity8 life - long passion : pensioner @entity8 has spent her life collecting the miniature homes after her mother bought her a dolls house in 1925 when she was just two - years - old for sale : @entity25 's collection - which includes furniture pieces from around the world - will be sold at auction her collection totals around 30 doll houses filled with everything from tiny chandeliers and silk curtains made from parachutes , to minute toilet rolls and even a toilet brush			1

she also picked up pieces from auctions and fairs , including @entity50 furniture , which kitted out an entire house			2
now the unique collection of houses will go under the hammer at the @entity56 salerooms of @entity15 & @entity57 , though it is so large that it will be split across two separate auctions , the first of which is being held tomorrow while the second will be a fortnight later			1
the sale will also include hundreds of pieces of furniture			0
mrs @entity25 's mother bought her first second - hand dolls house with furniture in 1925 when @entity8 was just two and they lived in @entity69 , @entity56			1
this was joiner - made and made around 1910 - meaning it has survived two world wars			0
over time the collection grew and they would buy from different shops , including a toy shop in @entity56 called @entity77 , where they would pick up furniture			1
the hobby stopped however when mrs @entity25 's mother died at the beginning of @entity81 and everything in the house was split up			1
fortunately , mrs @entity8 's brother kept on to the house and a box of furniture to be passed on to mrs @entity25 after the war and she picked up the hobby again after retiring as a physiotherapist			1
one of her favourite purchases was the house made up entirely with @entity50 furniture which has three tiers to it - each one has a different type of painted furniture on it			2
she also loved the largest house which was bought at @entity101 's and can be accessed from the front and back			1
the furniture from that particular house was made around the 1940s with the curtains made up of parachute material			2
@entity108 : the houses are kitted out with everything from fireplaces to sofas as well as miniature occupants unique : mrs @entity8 found many of the miniature house items at fairs , junk shops and gypsy markets around the world mrs @entity8 would love the dolls houses to either go to a museum or someone who will cherish them like she has			1
she could n't ever afford to buy a lot in one go and so she painstakingly collected piece by piece over time and looked after them with love and care			0
@entity15 , of @entity132 & @entity57 , said dolls houses are still popular collectors items today			2
he added : ' there is something of a cult hobby based on dolls ' houses and furniture			2
' modern dolls ' houses are to the same scale and there are small specialist makers turning out items such as chandeliers and grandfather clocks			2
it is a cottage industry			0
' it appeals to people who ca n't furnish a @entity153 dream home but they can do it in miniature			0
' but the dolls ' houses in this collection are to different scales			1
for future generations : mrs @entity8 hopes her collection with be bought by fellow doll house lovers or a museum ' some items of dolls ' house furniture can be expensive and it has happened that we have sold some which has fetched a higher price than the real life - size equivalent items			1
' @entity174 , pr consultant for @entity15 & @entity57 , added : ' there has been a lot of interest already			0
' it is such a unique collection			0
it includes stuff from @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
it 's quite an interesting collection			2
' i 've never seen one so big and to come from an old house in @entity185 it 's quite bizarre			2
' it can be collectors who are interested in this sort of thing			0
a lot of people collect dolls houses and have quite big collections			0
getting a closer look : @entity15 inspects the dolls houses ahead of the first auction lot tomorrow ' a lot of the time people have collected them when they were young and are still interested when they are retired			1
' also a lot of the time people buy them who want to live in a dream house themselves but ca n't afford it			0
' those people will often buy expensive things for dolls houses , like a crystal chandelier because they ca n't afford a real one , people enjoy that			0
' i think they will go for quite a lot			0
some of the things are really rare and so old they should go for quite a bit			0
' it is nice for the old lady who they belonged to			0
' building a dream house : the auctioneers say doll house collecting is still very popular today			0
