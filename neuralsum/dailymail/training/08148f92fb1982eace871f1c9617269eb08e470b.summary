@entity1 's toothless government today admitted it has lost control of capital @entity3 to rampaging @entity5 militants running riot across the country			1
as the country slides deeper into anarchy , former rebels - the very ones who together helped topple @entity11 in a @entity13 - backed uprising in 2011 - are turning their guns on each other in the struggle for command of the country 's political agenda as well as its vast oil reserves			1
the announcement comes a month after senior officials and the elected parliament fled to the remote eastern city of @entity27 as an alliance of armed factions led by forces from the western city of @entity32 took control of @entity3 , having expelled a rival group			1
and today prime minister @entity35 's interim government , which resigned last week , conceded that most apparatus of control in the country 's capital have been overrun by the marauding militants			1
they said they had entered the compound toward off looters , but pictures showed damage to the building 's grounds ' we announce that most ministries , institutions and state bodies in the capital @entity3 are out of our control , ' the government said in a statement late on sunday			1
armed groups had prevented staff from entering some government buildings , it added			0
the fluid situation in @entity3 has been exacerbated by separate clashes in the eastern port city of @entity77 where @entity78 , a renegade general from the @entity81 army , has declared war on @entity84 militants			2
on monday , loud explosions and war planes could be heard from the area of the closed airport which @entity84 forces have been trying to seize from @entity91 's forces allied to the regular army			0
at least eight soldiers were killed and 40 wounded , medics said			0
the area is one of the last positions of army special forces after @entity5 overran several camps			0
residents said the @entity5 including @entity101 were trying to enter the @entity102 home to the airport and airbase			0
a nearby soccer stadium was also hit			0
today 's announcement came as @entity1 's elected parliament , the @entity108 , asked prime minister @entity35 to form new government tore - establish order			1
the reappointment of @entity35 , a former defence minister and career soldier who has been prime minister since march , sets him the challenge of reasserting government control over a country where many fear a descent into full - scale civil war			2
carnage : last month , senior officials and the elected parliament moved to the remote eastern city of @entity27 as an alliance of armed factions took control of @entity3 leaving a trail of destruction in their wake , even wrecking planes at the city 's airport ' @entity108 has reappointed @entity35 today as the prime minister , asking him to form a crisis government within a period of time not exceeding two weeks , ' a spokesman said			1
@entity139 voted on monday to task @entity35 with forming a streamlined new government , the official news agency @entity138 reported			0
he was named to form an 18 - member team , down from the outgoing lineup 's number of around 30 , it said , adding that seven of the new ministers would put together a crisis cabinet			2
meanwhile , a rival body , the @entity152 , has named pro-islamist figure @entity153 to form a ' salvation government '			0
interim authorities have been steadily losing ground to the militias and the @entity1 ( @entity158 ) mainly @entity84 alliance , which seized @entity3 airport on august 22 after weeks of fierce fighting with nationalist rivals			1
storming in : a @entity164 user posted this video which purportedly shows @entity84 militiamen in the residential wing of the abandoned @entity53 embassy in @entity1 's capital , diving off the roof into the on - site swimming pool ( below ) control : the government conceded that most of its apparatus of control in the country 's capital have been overrun by the marauding militants all ministries , the state - oil @entity180 ( @entity182 ) and central bank are located in the capital			1
the persistent violence has not affected oil production but traders have said ownership of the oil might be subject to legal challenges if the @entity32 forces take control of the central bank , where crude revenues are booked			1
@entity1 has been locked in a bitter battle for control ever since former leader @entity11 ( pictured , right ) was toppled by a @entity13 - backed uprising three years ago			1
the country 's transition into democracy has been stifled by the very militant groups who helped @entity13 wrest the country from @entity11 's grasp in 2011			0
successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order , but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped - for transition to democracy			2
three years on , the nation is in deadlock between @entity1 ( @entity158 ) and the authorities which have been exiled in their own country , operating from @entity27 , some 900 miles from the capital			1
@entity1 rejects the legitimacy of the elected parliament because it allegedly supported air raids last month - which @entity53 officials said were carried out by the @entity229 - against its fighters deployed at the airport before they defeated nationalist militia rivals			1
@entity139 has in turn branded @entity1 as terrorists , putting them in the same boat as the @entity101 jihadists who control most of second city @entity77			1
the insecurity , as well as a lack of investment in upgrading rundown schools , have led to the start of the academic year , due on sunday , being postponed in @entity77 , @entity32 and @entity3			2
the new forces controlling @entity3 , some with @entity84 leanings , have refused to recognise the @entity245 , which has a strong liberal and federalist presence			2
they have reconvened the previous parliament , the @entity152 , in which @entity5 were strongly represented			0
western powers and @entity1 's neighbours fear the @entity252 country will turn into a failed state as the government lacks the backing of an army or police force to control the various armed groups			1
@entity3 is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since @entity11 's ouster			2
the militias , many of which originate from rebel forces that fought @entity11 , became powerful players in post-war @entity1 , filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army			0
successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order , but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped - for transition to democracy			2
it comes after an @entity84 - allied militia group said yesterday it had ' secured ' a @entity53 @entity288 compound in @entity3 , more than a month after @entity53 personnel evacuated from the country over ongoing fighting			1
militiamen stormed the residential annex of @entity53 's embassy in @entity3 on sunday , then took the time to give curious journalists in the @entity81 capital a tour			2
the group has taken up residence in the annex just over a month after diplomats fled to @entity303 over fears of mounting violence in the @entity252 nation in recent months			0
an @entity308 journalist walked through the @entity53 @entity288 compound sunday after the @entity310 , an umbrella group for @entity84 militias , invited onlookers inside			0
windows at the compound had been broken , but it appeared most of the equipment there remained untouched			0
@entity53 ambassador @entity318 , now posted in @entity319 , said on @entity320 that there was no indication the complex had been damaged			0
an @entity325 photographer who visited the complex spotted no damage apart from some shrapnel scars on an exterior barbed wire - topped wall			0
a commander for the @entity333 group said his forces had entered and been in control of the compound since last week and are there to protect it from looters .			0

last month , mps fled to the remote city of @entity27 after @entity3 was overrun
@entity1 is descending into anarchy as former rebels turn guns on each other
they want to set the political agenda and control @entity1 's vast oil reserves
