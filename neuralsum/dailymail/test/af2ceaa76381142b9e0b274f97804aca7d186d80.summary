@entity4 - steps off a fishing boat as he visits @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity22 today - said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to ' chip in a bit ' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year @entity4 leader @entity4 holds a cod at the @entity29 in @entity22 this morning after unveiling his plan to save popular rural areas from the blight of second home owners under the @entity4 plan , launched in @entity22 today , local authorities would have the power to charge 200 per cent council tax			1
the levy would be used in part to deter people from buying holiday homes in the first place , but the money generated could be used to support schools , post officers and other services which can become unviable without sufficient permanent residents			1
the double council tax would not be compulsory , but councils in areas like @entity51 , @entity22 and @entity52 have said they would be interested in the idea to ' discourage ' second home ownership			0
on a campaign visit in @entity56 , @entity22 , mr @entity4 said the move could help ' particularly in such a wonderful part of the country as this where there are so many people with second homes and where the prices because of that are way beyond the reach of many young people wanting to get their feet on the first rung of the property ladder '			1
the @entity4 leader even claimed second home - owners would ' like to chip in a bit extra ' to fund the communities in which they they spend their holidays			1
mr @entity4 , who visited @entity79 fish market and harbour with @entity82 candidate @entity81 as he launched his countryside charter , told @entity84 : ' it is giving councils the freedom to raise a bit of money from those who holiday in a community but do n't live in a community all year round so that local public services can be properly supported for those people who do live in their community all year round			1
' that seems to me to be fair and , i have to say to you , i suspect people who own second homes here - many of whom have significant means - would like to chip in a bit extra so that they know that , even though they are not living in a community all the time , they are nonetheless supporting the local services that local people do rely upon			2

mr @entity4 ( right ) holds a fish with @entity29 manager @entity131 ( left ) and harbour master @entity132 ( centre ) during a visit in @entity22 today ' what would a fancy second home in @entity22 , what would they pay in council tax , maybe a thousand quid , £ 1,500 ? ' i think if that is increased to £ 2,000 or a bit more , is that going to stop them buying it in the first place ? i doubt it			2
' of course i believe in and want to protect people 's freedoms to buy holiday homes and second homes			2
what i want to do is make sure it 's a fair deal for those communities where those second homes are located			0
' he added that many people who had second homes in @entity22 were ' acutely aware that there is this big , burning local issue about the availability of housing for local youngsters '			2
