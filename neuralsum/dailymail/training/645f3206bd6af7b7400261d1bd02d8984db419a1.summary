by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 came under furious attack today over his decision to veto @entity6 plans to crackdown on knife crime			1
the deputy prime minister said he would not support mandatory jail sentences for those caught carrying a knife for the second time			1
but he was attacked by listeners to his weekly radio show , the @entity16 and @entity18 's most senior police officer			2
@entity2 defended his knife crackdown veto on his weekly @entity21 phone in this morning mr @entity2 told @entity21 listeners : ' i do n’t think everybody , in all circumstances , at all times , should be chucked into prison when they are found carrying a knife the second time , regardless of the circumstances			1
' teacher @entity30 , 61 , was stabbed to death at @entity32 in @entity33 last week			1
her tragic killing has sparked calls for a crackdown on thugs carrying knives he added : ' all i ’m saying is yes , bang people up who should be banged up			2
yes , let ’s strengthen the law where people threaten you with a knife			0
' but saying that someone should always , always , no exceptions at all , end up in prison because they have a pen knife in their pocket , or a knife in their pocket having had a previous knife related offence i think that actually would rebound on us			0
' but one caller to mr @entity2 's weekly radio phone in on @entity21 , introduced as ' @entity61 in @entity62 ' demanded to know how many times people needed to be caught carrying a blade before they were punished			1
referring to the deputy prime minister , he added : ' how are elderly people meant to sleep in their beds when you ’ve got lunatics in suits like him who are looking after this country ? ' he then accused mr @entity74 of being soft on crime because it allowed the legal profession to make money defending criminals			1
@entity61 said : ' you ’ve created these monsters out there - you like it			0
you ’ve got all your lawyer mates all earning money out of it , the system			0
legal aid , help all the criminals @entity2			2
' a shocked mr @entity2 , whose wife @entity90 earns a reported £ 500,000 a year as a lawyer , responded : ' right			2
' the attack on mr @entity2 came as @entity18 's most senior police officer , @entity94 chief @entity93 , said it was ' vital ' that knife crime was tackled			1
labour leader @entity96 also suggested that @entity16 will back the @entity6 proposal , leaving mr @entity2 powerless to block it			1
the @entity16 leader told the @entity100 : ' i do n't agree with @entity2			1
i think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime			1
' @entity16 's been consistently arguing that this is an issue that needs to be looked at			2
' we definitely do want to use the legislation to strengthen the law and we are definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after a second offence , after conviction for a second offence			0
' we need to make sure it 's done in the right way , but that 's where we stand , because i think the public want to know that we are going to send a strong message to people who carry knives repeatedly that it is not acceptable			1
' mr @entity96 's remarks echoed @entity94 chief sir @entity93 who said mandatory jail sentences for carrying a blade , being pushed by the justice secretary @entity126 , would send a clear message to youngsters			1
sir @entity93 said the policy had worked with gun crime and could have the same effect in reducing the number of stabbings			1
but mr @entity2 accused the @entity6 of exploiting the tragic death of teacher @entity30 to look tough on crime			1
he claimed new proposals to automatically jail anyone twice caught carrying a knife were ' headline grabbing ' politics that could force judges to lock up innocent teenagers			1
the deputy pm said the move would be a ' step backwards ' - creating hardened criminals out of youngsters who had got themselves caught up with the wrong crowd			1
but sir @entity93 , the @entity149 , told @entity21 : ' for me , it 's vital we send a clear message to our young people			1
' he added : ' they do hear simple messages			0
they have heard it about guns , i think they need to hear it about knives			0
' mr @entity2 responded : ' the police , quite understandably , often say they want new powers on the statute book and often politicians and @entity167 say ' hang on a minute , we do n't just constantly put new offences on the statute book without considering the knock on effect on the prison population , on rates of re-offending			0
' now @entity93 , for instance , said well , of course , sometimes people might wander out of their home with a knife on them and not really remember and they have done it innocently			2
' the point is , under this arrangement that person would end up in prison because there are no extenuating circumstances			0
' he added : ' yes , let 's be really tough on knife crime but let 's be smart about how we are tough on knife crime			1
let 's not just simply catch headlines in a way which does n't necessarily deal with the problem			0
' the deputy prime minister insisted he was ' not soft on knife crime at all ' and wanted to ' bang people up who should be banged up '			1
he said young girls are often forced to carry knives for gang leaders and it was not right to automatically lock them up			1
mr @entity2 said forcing judges to imprison anyone caught with a knife would undermine their ability to weigh up the facts of each case			2
writing in the @entity212 , the @entity211 said : ' everybody has been shaken by the death of @entity30 and the notion that any teacher should lose their life in the classroom			0
it was especially poignant because she was clearly such a widely respected and loved teacher			0
' but in the aftermath of terrible events such as this we have to be careful that we do n't simply reach for headline - grabbing solutions that do n't necessarily work in practice			0
' the @entity229 leader 's explosive remarks threaten to spark a fresh @entity231 row			0
mr @entity2 's implication that mr @entity126 's proposals are designed to win political points are likely to infuriate the @entity6			1
today 's row comes just a week after mrs @entity30 , 61 , died after being stabbed by a teenage student at @entity32 in @entity33			0
a 15 - year - old boy has been charged with her murder			0
under mr @entity126 's proposal offenders caught twice with a knife to face an automatic six - month jail term			2
he wants mandatory jail sentences to be introduced through an amendment to the @entity244 , which returns to the @entity245 on may 12			1
mr @entity2 's intervention comes despite the lord chief justice @entity247 , the most senior judge in @entity248 and @entity249 , calling for an urgent review of sentencing for youths carrying knives			1
he said it was a ' major problem ' among 12 to 14 - year - olds			0
the country 's top judge , lord chief justice sir @entity247 , told peers an urgent review of sentencing for youths carrying knives was needed but mr @entity2 wrote that the proposed legislation might not work in practice			1
he said : ' when someone is caught carrying a knife , we need to do something about it			0
but six months in prison is not always the right answer			0
' imagine a vulnerable young girl hanging around with members of a gang			0
' she could be forced into carrying a knife by another gang member ; it happens a lot			0
when stopped by the police , she does n't mention that she was forced to carry the knife , fearing retribution from the gang			2
' putting someone like that into prison could push them into the arms of hardened criminals , and let the gang leaders off the hook			2
instead of prison , we need to divert vulnerable young people away from gang culture			0
' he called for decisions on sentencing to be left to judges so as not to undermine the justice system , saying : " this is why i believe this proposed law would be a step backwards			2
' it would undermine the government 's progress in establishing a rehabilitation revolution and reducing crime			0
we need to treat knife crime very seriously by letting judges choose the sentence to fit the crime			2
' turning the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow is not the answer			0
