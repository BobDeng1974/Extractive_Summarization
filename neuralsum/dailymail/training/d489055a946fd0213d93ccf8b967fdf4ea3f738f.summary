by @entity0 for the first time in four thousand years the ancient language called @entity2 can be heard thanks to decades of research			1
in a recording dr @entity6 , a linguistics expert from the @entity7 , reads the parable of the sheep and the horses in an ancient language called @entity2 , or @entity2			1
even though there is no written record of the language , dr @entity6 has managed to recreate an approximate version based on knowledge of ancient texts in @entity19 , such as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			2
the @entity24 hypothesis is the most likely explanation for how culture and language spread across early @entity28 and @entity29 the language was last spoken between approximately 4,500 and 2,500 b.c by our ancestors from all over @entity28 and @entity29			1
the parable itself was actually written in 1868 by @entity36 linguist dr. @entity35 , who then translated the story into @entity2 as a way to experiment with the vocabulary , according to @entity40			1
there is no way to create a definitive version of the language and @entity6 says his pronunciation is ' a very educated approximation			2
' audio source @entity47 the parable of sheep and horses as it appears when translated into @entity2 , an ancient language which helped create @entity53 speaking to @entity55 , he said : ' languages differ on how they pattern their sounds together , and they use those sounds to create new words			1
' despite the interest in his recording , @entity6 says that he has no intention to create any more , mostly because he would first have to create new stories as no written examples exist			2
some of the many modern languages that stem from the @entity19 family include @entity53 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
@entity6 added : ' @entity69 and @entity53 were 6,500 years ago the same language			0
that 's pretty cool , and it kind of gives you a sense of unity			0
' because of the lack of available information , @entity2 is a debated topic among researchers			2
@entity6 believes @entity2 was probably spoken on the @entity80 steppes around 6,500 years ago , but other researchers recently introduced a controversial new theory that it was spoken several thousand years earlier in @entity83			1
sadly we will probably never know what @entity2 actually sounded like , and @entity6 joked that the only way to create a definitive recording was to invent a time machine			1
' a sheep that had no wool saw horses , one of them pulling a heavy wagon , one carrying a big load , and one carrying a man quickly			0
the sheep said to the horses : " my heart pains me , seeing a man driving horses			0
" the horses said : " listen , sheep , our hearts pain us when we see this : a man , the master , makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself			0
and the sheep has no wool			0
" having heard this , the sheep fled into the plain			0

@entity2 , or @entity2 , was spoken across @entity28 and @entity29
believed to exist between 4,500 and 2,500 b.c
written example was created in @entity112 in 1868
this is the first time an attempt at pronouncing it has been made
