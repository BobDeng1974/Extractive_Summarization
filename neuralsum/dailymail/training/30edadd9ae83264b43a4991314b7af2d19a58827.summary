by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 9 november 2012 the @entity2 government has abandoned its five - year pledge to introduce a compulsory filter blocking child pornography and other objectionable internet content			0
instead , internet service providers have agreed to block 1,400 child abuse websites on @entity10 's ' worst of ' list , said communications minister @entity11			1
three of @entity2 's largest telecommunications companies - @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 - have been blocking the listed sites anyway since 2010			0
compromise : the @entity2 government downgraded strict internet restriction proposals to just concentrate on banning child abuse sites ' we 've actually reached agreement with the industry to block child pornography and we think that is a significant step forward , ' @entity11 told @entity26			1
critics had argued the proposed compulsory filter would have put @entity2 in the same censorship league as @entity30 and the @entity31 had been among those who expressed concerns at the proposed draconian regulations			0
the revised plan has a narrower focus on child abuse , as opposed to the original list which also wanted banned sites that carried extreme violence or detailed instructions on crime , drug use or acts of terrorism			1
opponents also argued that the filter would slow internet speeds , erroneously block harmless sites and restrict free speech			0
@entity51 campaigner @entity50 welcomed the government 's reversal but claimed it would n't have much impact			2
banned : the new proposals will compel internet service providers to ban child porn websites listed by @entity10 ' while this is a much better result than any of the previous proposals that the government came up with , it 's still really unlikely to do much good , ' he told @entity26			1
the @entity64 of @entity2 chief executive @entity65 said he was ' pleased that the government has now moved on ' from the filter and has narrowed the focus to just child abuse sites			1
however , the @entity69 said the agreement with @entity71 fell short of the pledges made during the 2007 election campaign			0
' the government 's decision not to legislate to the full extent of the commitment is a great disappointment , ' the @entity69 's managing director @entity74 said			2
in reality , the government never had a hope of getting the full filter legislation through parliament because @entity85 , a key government ally , joined the opposition in condemning the plans as a serious restriction of free speech .			0

@entity92 reached to block 1,400 child abuse website instead as set out on @entity10 banned list
*anti-censorship* campaigners had criticised the scope of government 's proposed mandatory ban
it means many crime , drugs and terrorism sites will remain *accessible*
