pilots with regional airline @entity2 are no longer allowed to use visual approaches to airports after one captain mistook a row of giant coal loaders for a runway , an air safety report has revealed			1
crews must use navigational equipment - instead of relying on the human eye - after the incident near @entity15 's @entity14 airport , when @entity16 was mistaken for a landing strip , even though it is 19km away from the small terminal			1
from a pilots perspective @entity14 airport , left , has similar features to @entity16 , right			0
a report released on friday by the @entity24 said air traffic controllers intervened just in time to direct the @entity27 plane back to @entity29 airport on november 8 , 2013			1
the plane ’s crew were given clearance to approach @entity14 at about 7.30pm			0
soon after air traffic controllers noticed the descending plane was making a questionable left hand turn after passing @entity36			2
a report found @entity14 airport , north east of @entity15 , was difficult to identify among other features on the ground the captain is reported to have seen a ‘ brightly lit row of buildings ’ and believed them to be a part of the airport			1
at this stage the tower controller saw that the plane was ‘ manoeuvring at a greater distance than usual from the runway ’ and redirected the @entity49 to @entity15 flight , not before it had descended to 450 metres off the ground			0
same , same but different : the @entity16 industrial area is located 19 kilometers from the airport after landing the pilot told authorities the airport was hard to identify as ' lighting conditions were darker than usual ' due to ' cloud cover in the western sky			0
’ @entity2 pilots have since been told not to make a visual approach , instead using navigation equipment to pinpoint their positions			0
banned : @entity27 airways have ruled out visual approaches after crew incorrectly identified @entity14 airport the report also claims the pilot was effected by an undisclosed illness which left him fatigued			1
' the captain later reported that he may not have been fully fit for duty and that , in hindsight , the illness may have affected his performance on the @entity79 flight			0
' a report found @entity14 airport , north east of @entity15 , was difficult to identify among other features on the ground .			2
