by @entity0 row : number 10 @entity1 and @entity3 were allegedly told in advance that @entity5 would be held at @entity6 @entity3 was today pulled into the row over the detention of the partner of a @entity11 journalist after it emerged @entity1 had advance warning of the operation			1
the prime minister was reportedly told @entity5 would be stopped at @entity6 on sunday because he was allegedly carrying ' highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism '			1
mr @entity5 's partner @entity18 is the @entity11 journalist who reported on @entity20 's internet spying programmes which were exposed by the fugitive whistleblower @entity21			1
he was stopped under schedule 7 of the @entity23 as he changed planes on a journey from @entity26 to his home in @entity28			1
a @entity1 source said @entity30 was ' kept abreast of the operation ' to detain @entity5 , but denied any political involvement in the decision , adding : ' the government does not direct police investigations			2
' the home secretary was also briefed prior to the nine - hour detention , while the @entity38 has also admitted that president @entity39 was also given a ' heads up ' , it was revealed			1
but @entity41 said that it was not for her to tell the police who they should or should not stop at ports , or who they should arrest			2
she said : ' i was briefed in advance that there was a possibility of a port stop of the sort that took place			0
' if it is believed that somebody has in their possession highly sensitive stolen information which could help terrorists , which could lead to a loss of lives , then it is right that the police act and that is what the law enables them to do			1
' but we live in a country where those decisions as to whether to stop somebody or arrest somebody are not for me as home secretary , they are for the police to take , that 's absolutely right that they have their operational independence and long may that continue			2
@entity92 applies only at airports , ports and border areas , allowing officers to stop , search , question and detain individuals			0
mr @entity5 claimed he was held for nine hours by agents who questioned him about his ' entire life ' and took his ' computer , video game , mobile phone , my memory card - everything '			1
the @entity11 has admitted he had been carrying ' journalistic materials ' and they paid for his flights , but said he was not employed by them			0
while in @entity26 mr @entity5 stayed withe @entity20 film - maker @entity109 , who has apparently been helping the @entity11 get through the @entity21 documents			1
the use of this terror law has been criticised by mr @entity18 - the reporter who interviewed @entity20 whistleblower @entity21 - as a ' profound attack on press freedoms and the news - gathering process ' , and has sparked widespread debate on the use of terror laws			2
a @entity120 spokesman today said the @entity11 is ' supportive ' of mr @entity5 's claim			1
the newspaper 's editor @entity122 told the @entity124 : ' we will have to work out if that is legal or not , and that will be subject to legal challenge , i believe , by @entity18 and @entity5 because it 's not clear that he was actually committing any offence in carrying material through @entity6			1
' i 'm not aware of what that offence is			0
' together again : @entity18 stands with @entity5 as they wait for the lift at @entity86 back : @entity5 ( second left ) , partner of @entity18 ( left ) , speaks to the media in @entity86 revelations : @entity21 roiled @entity20 intelligence agencies and upended @entity20 relations abroad with his disclosures of highly classified programmes that allow the @entity20 to collect millions of pieces of data he went on : ' i think there will be a legal challenge to the use of this very controversial bit , this schedule 7 , of the @entity23 and its use to obtain journalistic material			1
' a lot of journalists the world over fly through @entity6 and i think some of them now are going to be quite anxious about how the @entity157 authorities regard this bit of @entity157 that is not quite @entity157 but is @entity157			2
' schedule 7 of the @entity23 allows police officers to stop , search , question and detain individuals travelling through a port , airport or border area			0
it is to determine whether that person is or has been involved in the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism			0
stopping an individual does not necessarily mean that the officer believes the person is a terrorist - in fact , it does not require any reasonable suspicion that they might be one			0
detention is permitted for up to nine hours before an arrest or release must be made			0
but last month the @entity184 said the maximum detention period would be lowered to six hours			0
an examining officer may require a person to answer questions or provide certain documents - and failure to do so may be considered an offence under the @entity23			0
the @entity192 has defended the decision to detain @entity5 under terrorism laws , saying the government and police ' have a duty to protect the public and our national security '			2
@entity201 has defended the use of the @entity23 to detain mr @entity5 as he changed planes on a journey from @entity26 to his home in @entity28 as ' legally and procedurally sound '			1
and the @entity192 appeared to back the decision as a spokesman said : ' the government and the police have a duty to protect the public and our national security			0
' if the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism , then they should act and the law provides them with a framework to do that			1
' those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning			0
' this is an ongoing police inquiry so we will not comment on the specifics			0
' mr @entity122 has also revealed that ' shadowy ' government figures were sent in to destroy hard drives owned by the newspaper			2
in a comment piece in the paper , he said he held a series of meetings in which he was asked to destroy all @entity21 - related material			0
according to the @entity235 sources allege that @entity3 had approved to attempt to get the data because he feared that the newspaper 's computers could be hacked and the information used by terrorists or other enemies of the state .			1

@entity3 ' kept abreast ' of detention of @entity5 , sources say
@entity41 briefed because police feared he carried ' stolen information '
@entity28 was taken into custody by officials as he passed through @entity6
@entity20 president @entity39 was also given ' heads - up ' before he was taken
@entity201 said detention was ' legally and procedurally sound '
the 28 - year - old was held while on way home to @entity86 from @entity26
mr @entity5 is to launch a civil action over his detention
@entity264 agents took his drives , a computer - and even a video game
@entity11 editor claims @entity157 agents entered newspaper 's @entity264 office
