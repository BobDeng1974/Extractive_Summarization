by @entity0 @entity2 ’s alarming collapse could cost @entity4 ’ side the title after @entity6 exposed the @entity7 ’ defensive frailties on monday night			1
there ’s no doubt the @entity12 boss will be on the lookout for replacements this summer			1
@entity16 ’s @entity15 looks at 10 possible options for @entity4 to consider to shore - up his leaky defence			1
@entity19 @entity20 : @entity21 £ 12m @entity23 defender who plays at left - back for his country but centre - back for his club			2
technically good , has pace , is tough and grabs the occasional goal			2
@entity30 @entity31 : @entity32 : £ 10m stylish @entity34 defender with a ruthless streak			2
good on the ball and 6ft 5ins tall			0
has also been watched by @entity37 and @entity38 over recent years			0
@entity39 @entity40 : @entity41 : £ 5m @entity42 international is ready to leave @entity43 but has one year left on his contract			0
@entity2 have watched him and team - mate @entity45			1
@entity46 @entity47 : @entity41 £ 12m @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity37 have all watched him and @entity2 can see his potential but @entity52 will make it difficult for him to leave just now			1
@entity54 @entity55 : @entity41 : £ 22m @entity57 international has been watched by @entity48 , @entity58 and @entity59 but all have question marks about his ability to match the more physical opponents			0
@entity64 @entity65 : @entity21 : £ 12m move to @entity67 has only served to improve his reputation			0
@entity70 international is a good all - round defender and @entity74 experience helps			1
@entity75 @entity76 : @entity77 : £ 30m accomplished holding midfielder who can also play at centre - back			1
the @entity80 is unsettled at @entity81 and is among players considering his future under @entity84			0
@entity85 @entity86 : @entity41 : £ 8.5m has had an indifferent season but emerged with credit despite @entity90 ’s relegation			1
@entity4 is a fan and age is on his side to keep improving			1
@entity93 @entity94 : @entity95 : £ 25m not the biggest centre - back but tough and uncompromising			0
has good positional sense , reads the game very well and intercepts danger frequently			0
@entity100 @entity102 @entity101 : @entity103 : £ 8m still a bit raw but has right physical attributes			0
has also been watched by @entity37 and @entity48			0
@entity2 scouts watched the @entity107 in action against @entity109 in march			2
and here ’s one they prepared earlier ... @entity112 @entity113 : 18 @entity2 paid compensation to @entity115 for the teenage defender who is impressing club coaches and has captained the under 21 side			2
is decent on the ball , is 6ft 3ins tall and still growing			0
homegrown : @entity120 ( right ) has impressed for @entity2 's under 21 side this season			1

@entity2 have *conceded* 49 goals in the @entity74 this season
@entity4 will no doubt be looking for defenders this summer *transfer* window
likes of @entity75 and @entity85 could cure defensive frailties
