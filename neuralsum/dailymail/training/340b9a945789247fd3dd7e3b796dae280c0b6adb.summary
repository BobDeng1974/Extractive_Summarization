by @entity0 the work began the moment @entity4 's floodwaters ebbed back into the sea			2
over the past year , people from @entity7 , @entity8 , to @entity9 , @entity10 , have been mucking out their flooded homes , trucking away tons of debris and putting their lives back together , one piece of drywall at a time			1
there has been plenty to do			2
when the @entity21 heaved forward , it swallowed thousands of vehicles and fried the power systems that make the @entity25 skyline dazzle after dark			2
a flag waving in front of the burned remains of more than 60 small bungalows which were destroyed at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity8 , during @entity4 now : a tattered flag flapping in the wind in @entity36 , @entity8 , where 60 small bungalows that once made up @entity39 were destroyed in a fire a year ago during @entity4 then : @entity41 , right , walking with his wife , @entity42 , in the middle of @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity8 , two days after @entity4 hit the area now : @entity47 holds a stick while crossing @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity8 a year ago , the road was covered in beach sand and debris hundreds of buildings burned in wind - whipped @entity56 year into the recovery , some of the locations hit hardest by the storm have been revisited			1
the progress in some communities has been remarkable			1
in others , it has been painfully slow			1
boardwalks and amusement parks on @entity64 and the @entity65 have been rebuilt			0
yet , countless buildings sit vacant and moldering , while others have been reduced to empty lots or piles of sand			1
then : debris left by @entity4 where the boardwalk had been in front of @entity77 's arcade in @entity78 , @entity8 now : people walking along the rebuilt boardwalk in @entity78 , @entity8 , where a year ago @entity4 left the resort area in ruins some homeowners are still staring at the same stripped studs and piles of lumber that have been in their living rooms since last november			1
one thing is clear : there has been no retreat yet from the shore			0
houses are slowly rising again all along the coast , albeit sometimes on strange platforms above the high water mark			0
thousands of people still trying to fix their soaked and surf - battered homes are being stymied by bureaucracy , insurance disputes and uncertainty over whether they can even afford to rebuild			2
then : @entity25 in the dark during @entity4 , as seen from the @entity104 in the @entity104 borough of @entity106			0
@entity107 , background center , remains brightly lit now : nearly a year after @entity4 , shows the illuminated skyscrapers of lower @entity25 as a backdrop to ongoing construction in the @entity104 neighborhood , in the @entity104 borough of @entity106 then : @entity113 of @entity36 , @entity8 , reacting while looking at the destruction left behind when the @entity21 breached over land in @entity116 , @entity8 , the morning after @entity4 rolled through now : @entity113 standing at the same spot where a year earlier he witnessed the destruction left behind when the @entity21 breached over @entity116 then : sea water flooding the entrance to the @entity121 in @entity106 as @entity4 struck the city now : a taxi entering @entity106 's @entity121 in lower @entity25 nearly a year after @entity4 flooded the tunnel and other low - lying areas of the city , including the nearby @entity107 construction site billions of dollars in federal aid appropriated months ago by @entity129 have yet to reach homeowners who need that money to move on			1
many have found flood insurance checks were n't nearly enough to cover the damage			0
and worse , new federal rules mean many in high - risk flood zones may have to either jack their houses up on stilts or pilings - an expensive , sometimes impossible task - or face new insurance rates that hit $ 10,000 or more per year			2
' it 's just been such a terrible burden , ' says @entity144 , whose home in @entity146 , @entity8 , is still a wreck after filling with 4 feet of water			1
contractors say it will cost $ 270,000 to rebuild - about double what the insurance paid out			0
the family does n't have the money			0
' my son is 11			0
he has a little piggy bank in his room			0
he said , " take it , mom			0
" then : @entity160 carting belongings from her flood - damaged home as she passes the charred ruins of other homes in the @entity166 section of the @entity168 borough of @entity106			0
in the beachfront enclave of @entity166 fire burned 130 houses and flooding destroyed another 220 now : workers walking between houses under construction and empty concrete foundations in the @entity166 neighborhood of the @entity168 borough in @entity106 then : homes that were destroyed by @entity4 , at @entity45 in @entity181 , @entity182 a year after @entity4 devastated the @entity183 and @entity106 and pounded coastal areas of @entity185 , the region was still dealing with a slow and frustrating , yet often hopeful , recovery now : a sign in a section of @entity45 in @entity181 , @entity8 , on an empty lot in an area where the debris from numerous homes was removed after being destroyed last october then : commuters wait in a line to board buses into @entity25 in front of the @entity197 in the @entity104 borough of @entity106			1
the line stretched twice around the arena and commuters reported wait times of one to three hours to get on a bus now : the scene in front of the @entity197 in the @entity104 borough of @entity106 a year later then : the streets under the @entity206 in the @entity104 borough of @entity106 are flooded as @entity4 hit the city now : a car and its streaking lights along @entity210 in the @entity212 section of the @entity104 borough of @entity106			2
almost a year ago , this area became impassable to people and vehicles alike after @entity4 floods forced the @entity217 to rise above its banks and defy elaborate preventative planning then : a firefighter surveying the smoldering ruins of houses in the @entity166 section of the @entity168 borough of @entity106			1
more than 100 homes there were destroyed in a fire which swept through the oceanfront community in the wake of @entity4 now : a view of @entity231 in the @entity166 section of the @entity168 borough of @entity106 where a statue of the @entity233 that survived a massive fire once stood			0
the statue became an iconic image of @entity4 's wrath then : downed power lines and a battered road smashed by @entity4 in @entity78 , @entity240 , the storm that made landfall a day earlier , caused multiple fatalities , halted mass transit and cut power to more than 6 million homes and businesses now : traffic flowing on a road connecting the barrier island at @entity78 , @entity8 , with the mainland of @entity181 , @entity8 then : @entity253 resident @entity252 walks along the beach under what is left of the @entity253 boardwalk days after @entity4 in the @entity168 borough of @entity106 now : a view along the beach with reinforced dunes and the buried remains of the former boardwalk in a @entity253 neighborhood in the @entity168 borough of @entity106			2
nealry a year ago , the boardwalk stood above the beach , used by the neighborhood and many other @entity106 , but was wiped away by the storm surge then : a woman walks past debris from the damaged boardwalk in @entity78 , @entity8 , as clean - up of the damage from @entity4 continued throughout the region now : people walk along the rebuilt boardwalk in @entity78 , @entity8 a year ago the boardwalk was destroyed and the area was inundated by sand in the wake of @entity4 then : the sun rising in @entity78 , @entity8 , behind the @entity280 which had been sitting in the ocean after part of the @entity282 was destroyed during @entity4 now : an empty section of the @entity21 off @entity78 , @entity8 , where , for months after the @entity280 rose out of the water after the @entity282 was destroyed by the storm			1
the pier was the former site of the roller coaster that was swept into the ocean , creating one of the storm 's enduring images			0
the roller coaster was removed in may then : a piece of construction equipment working on the pile of debris , collected during the cleanup from @entity4 , in the parking lot of @entity300 in the @entity253 section of the @entity168 borough now : the parking lot at @entity304 empty of all the debris that had been stored there following @entity4 then : a street sign is buried more than halfway up in sand in @entity7 , @entity8 , after a storm surge from @entity4 pushed the @entity21 and sand over the beach and across @entity312 now : a piece of blue tape on a sign pole in @entity7 , @entity8 , marking the height the sand reach last october in the wake of @entity4			1

over the past year , people from @entity7 , @entity8 , to @entity9 , @entity10 , have been putting their lives back together
the progress in some communities has been remarkable . in others , it has been painfully slow
countless buildings sit vacant and moldering , while others have been reduced to empty lots or piles of sand
