a fatberg stretching 66 feet beneath the government offices in @entity2 will be cleared as it was blocking all the sewers in the central @entity5 stretch and risking sewage coming up through people 's plugholes			1
the fatberg - one of the biggest ever to be cleared by @entity9 - has been largely created by people throwing wet wipes and fat down drains and toilets , which then congeals into a large immovable mass. removing the fatberg will cost tens of thousands of pounds and is likely to cause disruption as roads in central @entity5 will have to be closed to make way for specialist equipment			1
but if it is left it will grow , more fat and wet wipes will congeal , and there is a real risk that sewers could flood and people living nearby will see waste coming up through their sinks and toilets			1
the fatberg is at the junction of @entity42 and @entity43 in south @entity5 and is in a sewer measuring 6ft high and 3ft wide			2
it stretches throughout 66 feet of the central @entity5 sewer and is almost the length of an articulated , or bendy , bus			1
the @entity49 is broken down into smaller pieces spread through the extensive stretch of pipes but is still one of the biggest ever @entity9 have had to deal with			0
officials at @entity9 said the amount of fat contained in the mass is not surprising given that pipes from @entity59 , where there are a number of restaurants and fast food outlets , feed into it			0
@entity65 , the sewer manager for west @entity5 at @entity9 , said : ' we have 67,108 miles of sewers , and that 's a lot of pipe to keep clear			2
sewer worker @entity70 is holding a piece of fatberg he grabbed out of the @entity2 ‘ river of fat ’ the @entity2 sewer is a trunk sewer , which means smaller pipes feed into it before the waste is taken away ' we spend £ 12 million a year tackling blockages , most of them formed because people have tipped cooking fats down the drain and wet wipes down the loo			1
' the sewers serve an important purpose - they are not an abyss for household rubbish			0
' mr @entity65 warned against throwing rubbish down sewers and drains , such as wet wipes and fat which because this does not break down			2
instead it congeals into large immovable clumps and can cause sewer floods , which he described as ' horrific			0
' he added : ' we find objects down the sewers every day that should not be there			0
planks of wood , plastic bottles , and the bane of our lives – wet wipes			0
they may say flushable on the packet but they do n't break down inside the sewer			0
a close - up of the fatberg , which has been formed by a collection of fat and wet wipes congealing into a mass the fatberg is located in a sewer at the junction of @entity124 and @entity42 , measuring 6ft tall ' they cling to cooled cooking fat and form fatbergs , which block pipes and flood our customers with sewage			1
' officials examining the @entity49 found nail varnish pots , a pencil sharpener , condoms , and sanitary products - all of which should not be there			1
staff from @entity9 will use powerful suction equipment to break down the blockage and then high - powered water jets to clear the tunnels			0
because of the central location of the fatberg roads will have to be closed so equipment can be taken down into the sewers and there is likely to be significant disruption			0
@entity9 said it has to remove around 55,000 fatbergs a year , caused by people throwing unsuitable rubbish down toilets and drains which congeals into a large immovable mass. this costs more than £ 1million a month			1
a fatberg formed from fat , wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in @entity166 ’s @entity165 just two months ago and measured about the size of a @entity168 a 15 ton fatberg was found congealed in a @entity171 sewer in august 2013 and was dubbed the biggest ever just two months ago , a fatberg described as being the length of a @entity168 was found to be blocking the sewer beneath homes in @entity166 's @entity165 , west @entity5			1
a fatberg is a congealed lump consisting of fat , wet wipes , sanitary items and other items in sewer systems , which unlike lavatory paper do not break down			1
@entity184 is the official term given to the deposits by @entity9 in @entity5			2
regarded as a nuisance , they can also be used as fuel , specifically biogas			0
the blockage was made up of waste fat , wet wipes , food , tennis balls and planks of wood			2
staff from @entity9 found the blockage when they checked beneath a 260ft section of road			0
they cleared the huge underground pipe using high - powered jets			0
last year a huge fatberg with a mass of 15 tonnes and measuring the size of a double - decker bus was found beneath the streets of @entity5 , and was growing at a mass of three extra tonnes a month as people continued to pour fat down drains and put wet wipes down the lavatory .			1

@entity184 is blocking sewage pipes beneath @entity32 offices in @entity2
it stretches for 66 feet throughout sewer - almost the length of a bendy bus
@entity184 is one of the biggest ever and was created by wet wipes and fat
it is blocking a main @entity5 sewer and risks sewage coming up plugholes
nail varnish pots , condoms and a pencil sharpener were all found in fatberg
around £ 1m is spent every single month removing fatbergs like this one
@entity9 say sewer flooding is ' horrific ' and urge people to *dispose* of fat and wet wipes *properly* , rather than down the drain or lavatory
