by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity3 airlines are on high alert after @entity6 raised its aviation alert for the restless @entity9 volcano to red			0
seismologists say magma is moving under the @entity14 glacier but so far has travelled horizontally at a depth of 3 to 6 miles			1
the volcano will erupt if the magma melts the ice above			0
thousands of small earthquakes have rattled the volcano deep in the past week , with activity picking up today after a lull			1
a 2010 eruption of the @entity34 volcano produced an ash cloud that caused a week of international aviation chaos , with more than 100,000 flights cancelled			1
aviation regulators since have reformed policies about flying through ash , so a new eruption would be unlikely to cause as much disruption			1
scientists had planned to fly over @entity14 later today to look for changes on the surface but it was not clear if that would still take place			1
earlier this week authorities had evacuated several hundred people from highlands north of the glacier as a precaution			2
the area is uninhabited but popular with hikers			0
a spokesman for the @entity24 @entity57 said that air travel would not be affected until an eruption actually breaks the ice			2
' the ( @entity24 ) @entity61 will be monitoring what 's occurring			0
they will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air , ' he said			2
' if the eruption does occur we will issue what 's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions			2
it 's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly			0
' @entity79 , a vulcanologist with the @entity80 , said the amount of ash produced would depend on the thickness of the ice			2
' the thicker the ice , the more water there is , the more explosive it will be and the more ash - rich the eruption will be , ' she said			1
thick smoke : a 2010 eruption of the @entity34 volcano produced an ash cloud that caused a week of international aviation chaos , with more than 100,000 flights cancelled a spokesman for @entity97 , the @entity24 's air traffic control organisation , said : ' @entity97 is monitoring the situation and working in close collaboration with the @entity61 , @entity101 and our safety regulator , the @entity57 , as this dynamic situation develops further			1
' she added that @entity97 will help determine what impact the eruption will have for operations in @entity24 airspace and advise airline customers accordingly			0
a spokesman for budget airline @entity112 said it is putting its contingency plans into action following the red alert , using specialist technology to ensure any ash created by the eruption is detected and chartered			1
' @entity112 will use this and other data provided by the authorities to determine what , if any , changes it should make to its flying programme , ' he said			0
' as things stand there are no changes to @entity112 's flying programme , including flights to and from @entity6			0
' he added : ' the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is @entity112 's highest priority			0
' @entity6 sits on a volcanic hot spot in the @entity139 's mid-oceanic ridge			0
eruptions are frequently triggered there when the @entity143 's plates move and when magma from deep underground pushes its way to the surface .			1

@entity149 is moving deep *beneath* a glacier but has not broken the surface
if it does it could cause an ash cloud like that of @entity34 in 2010
but regulators say any new eruption would not cause as much disruption
