@entity1 divers may have found the body of the @entity4 co-pilot who was steering the @entity6 plane when it crashed into the @entity7 killing 162 people onboard , an official has confirmed			1
coordinator of the search and rescue effort @entity12 said the body , believed to be co-pilot @entity14 was retrieved from the front part of the fuselage during a search operation on friday			1

@entity1 divers may have found the body of the co-pilot who was steering @entity6 plane when it crashed a section of @entity6 flight @entity30 's tail is loaded onto a boat for transportation to @entity34 from @entity35 a formal confirmation will be given after the @entity39 ( dvi ) team finish identifying the body , which is in poor condition , @entity12 said			1
it was revealed by crash investigators last month that the @entity4 co-pilot was flying the plane before it crashed , rather than captain @entity45 , an experienced former fighter pilot			1
two people close to the crash investigation said captain @entity45 had gone to disconnect the faulty @entity48 at the time of the accident leaving the co-pilot in control			1
@entity30 went down in stormy weather on december 28 in the @entity7 during what was supposed to be a short trip from the @entity1 city of @entity57 to @entity58			2
divers also found three bodies inside the main body of the plane on friday and another three bodies near the fuselage , bringing a total number of dead retrieved to 101 , @entity12 said			1
rescue services are still trying to lift the fuselage from the seabed using giant inflatable bags after earlier attempts failed			0
the @entity6 flight vanished from radar screens on december 28 , less than half - way into a two - hour flight workers load the tail of @entity77 onto truck at @entity35 sea port , in @entity80 on friday it comes after the pilot of the @entity6 plane was out of his seat at the moment the plane stalled and was unable to stop the crash , sources have said			2
investigators believe the computer malfunctioned during the flight , but instead of resetting it , the pilot climbed out of his seat and disconnected it from a circuit breaker located behind the co-pilot			2
during the few moments @entity45 was out of his seat the co-pilot lost control			1
the plane climbed sharply , before either stalling or losing thrust , then fell almost straight down into the ocean below			0
by the time @entity45 had managed to get back to his seat it was too late to save the aircraft			1
the @entity48 limits the movement of the plane , preventing pilots for pulling dangerous manouvres , rather like an electronic speed limiter in a car			0
one man familiar with the case said mr @entity45 had flown in the same @entity111 several days before the crash and was aware the device intermittently turned itself off			1
@entity1 divers found a body believed to belong to the @entity4 co-pilot of the @entity6 plane that crashed captain @entity45 ( left ) got out of his seat to turn off a faulty computer , leaving co-pilot @entity119 in charge but even if the device had turned itself off it would not immediately affect the path of the aircraft			1
an @entity111 pilot , who did not wish to be named , said the device could be reset using a button on the dashboard , and struggled to explain why mr @entity45 would have felt it necessary to leave his seat			1
he said : ' to cut all power to it is very unusual			0
you do n't pull the circuit breaker unless it was an absolute emergency			0
i do n't know if there was one in this case , but it is very unusual			0
' @entity139 plunged into the sea during a flight between @entity57 , @entity1 , to @entity58 on december 28 killing everyone on board			2
moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control to report a storm ahead and asked to be allowed to climb above it , but was told the airspace was too busy			0
the aircraft 's black box recorders have now been recovered from the seabed and are being examined for any clues they might hold on the plane 's last moments			2
@entity6 said it would not comment while the matter was under investigation by the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) of @entity1			2
the @entity111 climbed suddenly before falling almost directly down into the @entity7 , killing all 162 people on board			0
rescue workers are still pulling the wreckage from the ocean ( pictured ) the @entity159 has said it is too early to say what role either human factors or equipment may have played in the crash , which is still being investigated			0
the head of the investigation , @entity170 , told reporters this week it was too early to say whether the accident involved pilot error or a mechanical fault			0
the @entity159 said on thursday the jet was in sound condition and all crew members were properly certified			0
lawyers for the family of the @entity4 co-pilot say they have filed a lawsuit against @entity6 in @entity184 for ' endangering the lives of others ' by flying the route without official authorisation on that day			2
investigators have said the accident was not related to the permit issue			0
@entity6 did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit .			0

@entity1 divers have found a body believed to be the @entity4 co-pilot
officials said the body was retrieved from the front part of the fuselage
it 's reported the body was wearing a uniform with three stripes on shoulder
divers found more bodies on friday - bringing a total number to 101
it comes as investigators revealed captain @entity45 turned off faulty *system*
this would have meant pilots took manual control of the @entity111
by the time @entity221 got back to his seat aircraft was plunging into ocean
experts say turning off computer manually is a ' *highly* unusual move '
