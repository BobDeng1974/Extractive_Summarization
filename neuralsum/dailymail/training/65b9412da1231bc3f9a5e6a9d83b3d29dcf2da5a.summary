by @entity0 no damage has been found on a @entity4 oil drilling ship that lost its mooring and drifted into an @entity7 harbour on saturday , the @entity1 has said			1
video captured by divers who examined the hull of the 571ft - long rig @entity13 shows no signs of grounding , it is claimed			1
the ship slipped its anchorage on saturday in winds up to 35mph , drifting extremely close to shore in @entity20			1
just how close is still a subject of hot debate - one local captain disputed initial reports that said the @entity13 came within 100 years of shore			1
@entity26 took photos that he claims show the vessel came much closer to land and prove it was not moving and grounded			1
grounded ? @entity4 oil drilling rig the @entity13 lies in @entity7 's @entity20 after losing its mooring on saturday			1
local harbour captain @entity26 claims this photo shows the vessel clearly ran aground port : the ship slipped its anchorage on saturday in winds up to 35 mph , drifting extremely close to shore in @entity20 ( pictured ) he said : ' there 's no question it hit the beach			1
that ship was not coming any closer			2
it was on the beach			1
' but @entity46 investigators say otherwise			0
lt @entity47 said : ' we are still reviewing the video			0
however , what i can tell you is that there is no physical evidence that suggests that they hit bottom			0
' we believe if they did ground , it was a very soft grounding			2
' earlier footage taken by a remotely operated vehicle also shows no damage , he said			0
there have also been no reports of injury or pollution			0
the @entity13 , owned by @entity68 , is among a @entity4 fleet to soon head north for planned exploratory drilling in the @entity72 waters of the @entity74 and @entity75 seas			1
the ship is now anchored 750yards from land after it was towed offshore following the mishap			0
@entity4 spokesman @entity80 said about 120 crew members were on board when the @entity13 dragged anchor			1
they remain on board gearing up to begin the journey to the @entity72 in late july			0
mr @entity0 said the trip will take four or five days , and the company aims to begin drilling in early august			0
battling evil : actress @entity90 as @entity91 ( left ) and taking part in a @entity94 protest aboard the @entity13 in february ( right ) true believer : the environmentalist waves a placard aboard the drilling ship @entity13 in an attempt to stop it from sailing to @entity7 drilling in @entity72 waters is bitterly opposed by environmental groups and some @entity7 residents			1
their lawsuits and permit appeals have prevented @entity4 from drilling in the @entity74 , where the subsidiary of @entity4 spent $ 2.1billion on leases in 2008			0
@entity4 also holds older leases in the @entity75 and hopes to drill exploratory wells this summer in both locations			0
environmentalists say the anchorage problem is yet another reason to question @entity4 's @entity72 plan , particularly after the same vessel ran into a mooring problem in a severe storm in @entity122 waters last year			2
the @entity13 had been drilling an exploratory well off the @entity125 coast			1
@entity122 officials say three of eight anchor cables broke after the crew had already disconnected from the oil well when alerted to bad weather approaching			0
soon after the incident , @entity4 officials said there were no injuries or harm to the environment or the well , and that the vessel sustained minor damage and was repaired			2
the incident was investigated by @entity122 officials , who said no further action was warranted			0
mr @entity0 said @entity4 has been excited about the @entity72 project for a long time , but that the discoverer incident temporarily damped that excitement			2
he said : ' anytime something like this happens operationally , you have to take it extremely seriously			0
' our goal is always flawless execution , and when that does n't happen - either in port or offshore - it 's unacceptable			2
