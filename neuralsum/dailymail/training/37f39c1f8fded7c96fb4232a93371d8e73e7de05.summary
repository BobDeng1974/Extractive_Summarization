these are the latest designs from the retailer – and the ones they are hoping will win back clothes shoppers who have abandoned it in their droves			2
@entity14 , the 51 - year - old former @entity15 and @entity16 boss tasked with turning around fashion fortunes at @entity5 , admitted she had suffered ‘ a few sleepless nights ’ ahead of the autumn / winter collection preview last night			1
back in business : a £ 45 skirt and £ 59 jacket , left , cinched in with a £ 9.50 belt and a sparkling floor - length @entity5 dress for £ 119 , right , form part of the new make - or - break collection get the look : a £ 249 autograph jacket and £ 399 dress , left , and £ 349 coat , right she was brought in as @entity5 's new style director last summer and said she is pushing the concept of ' fashion ' rather than ' clothing '			1
‘ we are not afraid to raise the taste bar , ’ she said			2
‘ you will be seeing a lot more fashion and a lot more of @entity5 at fashion weeks			1
‘ it is fashion with a capital @entity46 ’ @entity5 boss @entity47 said they want to draw in the kinds of women who may shop there for luxury food but not clothing			1
he described the store ’s new strategy as being ‘ the same as food - seeing something particularly nice to eat at the weekend and having it			0
’ bosses at the event said that future ranges would focus more on ‘ high fashion ’ , while insisting the designs would also win over traditional @entity5 shoppers			2
for grown - ups : a £ 15 jumper and £ 129 trousers , left , and a £ 110 and £ 29.50 skirt , right longer sleeves : a £ 49.50 jumper and £ 65 skirt and a £ 55 jumper and £ 199 skirt , right , worn with a £ 22.50 scarf this soft tweedy suit with nipped - in waist and pencil skirt reaching below the knee is wool , and sexy , and classy , with a hint of stretch , and lined in silk , and women will buy it ! okay , not teenagers , but they have plenty of places to shop ; we do n’t care about them			0
not mums who shop in @entity90 , because they have no conscience			0
this new collection is ethical , it is cool , it is classy , and it is part of the first collection from the new broom at @entity5			2
and i think women will adore it			0
i love , love , love this gunmetal sequinned gown : it is backless , so men can see your skin			0
it has sleeves , so no one , no one , gets to see those bingo wings			0
and it is a smidgeon over £ 100 ! women of @entity114 , what more do you want ? blood ? the debut collection from @entity14 , the @entity117 of @entity5 , filtering into stores from july , is classy			1
yes , it is pricey – with a wool , @entity114 - made pea coat at nearly £ 300 – but it is for grown - ups			0
yes , i admit @entity14 , who gave us designers at @entity15 and resurrected @entity16 , who told me last week she only ever bought food from @entity5 , has failed to cull the teen @entity5 label @entity130 , but on the whole she knows the @entity5 shopper is just like her : over 50			1
not a child , not a prostitute , not a twentysomething binge drinker , but a fabulous , fit , fiftysomething			0
fabrics are great , basics are good quality , there are 80 per cent more sleeves on dresses and tops , and there is enough fashion – machine washable silk cocktail dress , covered in roses , anyone ? for £ 75 ! – to keep even a fashionista happy			0
this collection is make or break for @entity5 : with haemorrhaging sales of womenswear , this autumn / winter range must work , or not only is @entity14 for the chop , but so too will be ceo @entity47			1
@entity14 spent her first two months talking to women shoppers , and they told her they want quality from @entity5 , not bias cut gypsy skirts in crinkled linen			1
let ’s hope we are true to our word @entity163 : a £ 59 animal print jacket and £ 35 trousers and £ 79 coat and £ 29.50 skirt , right accessories : a £ 199 striped coat , £ 99 bag and £ 19.50 hat			0
