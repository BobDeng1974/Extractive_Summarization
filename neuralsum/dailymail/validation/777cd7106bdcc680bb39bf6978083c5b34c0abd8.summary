five years ago @entity0 beat @entity1 to win the @entity2			2
the winning goal came from a striker who burst powerfully into the box , between two opponents , before firing home a sweet shot into the corner beyond the keeper			0
a cool finish on a big occasion			0
a few months later , i saw him come on as a substitute in the @entity16 and display some clever touches and neat footwork			0
he stood out as one of the more technically gifted players on display in the second tier game			0
fast forward a few more months and that teenage striker - playing in the @entity16 - picked up the ball in his own half , ran towards the opposition goal , beat two defenders , wrong - footed the keeper and slotted into an empty net			0
@entity30 made a disastrous decision to move to @entity32 when his career was flying in the championship , he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch two weeks after that he scored a hat - trick			1
in the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move			1
to those who did n't follow @entity30 's career before he went to the @entity44 , all they will know of him is that he is highly - paid , and not exactly outstanding			1
sure , there was a flurry of goals to help @entity32 stay up at the back end of last season , but that has been it			1
stories emerged last season of his big spending - £ 17,500 on a gold bottle of champagne , and a £ 140,000 @entity58			0
these barely make a dent in his £ 60,000 - a - week salary , and they look cheap compared with team - mate @entity63 and his £ 260,000 @entity64 parked next to his £ 160,000 @entity65			0
these underachieving @entity32 players do n't mind showing off their wealth , do they ? stories have emerged of @entity30 's extravagant spending - £ 17,500 on a bottle of champagne , for example in a loan spell at @entity73 , he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer is it something about the club that means these players have no self - awareness whatsoever ? is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they 're so truly terrible on the pitch , it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch ? one of @entity30 's managers called him ' a playboy model , ' and said he needed a ' slap in the face ' to help him realise his talent			1
and make no mistake , @entity30 is a very talented footballer			1
unfortunately he chose the wrong club			2
since @entity30 joined @entity32 he has had 10 different managers at club level , including his loan spells			1
that is not the ideal environment for young talent to be nurtured and flourish			0
managers come and go so quickly that the pressure for immediate results is huge , so the time a manager can devote to individual players on and off the pitch is restricted			2
@entity30 should be spearheading @entity113 ' @entity112 campaign but he has not been selected the 21 - year - old has been stuck out on the left for @entity32 when he is clearly a centre - forward at a more stable club , the chances are that @entity30 might have a better environment to succeed			1
on the pitch he has been stuck out on the left when he is obviously a centre forward			0
that 's where he did so well at the end of last season			2
off the pitch , has the so - called ' playboy model ' been guided properly ? evidence suggests not : @entity127 even admitted he ignored @entity30 when he first arrived at the @entity128 as manager			1
he revealed he did n't even sit down and talk to the player			0
@entity32 signed @entity30 but their duty does n't stop there			1
they need to provide that player with every chance to succeed			0
hopefully stability will reign at the @entity128 in the near future , @entity30 will get the right guidance off the field , and he will be allowed to play to his strengths on the field			2
@entity32 need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but @entity30 has not been guided @entity32 are a basket case of a club and @entity30 made the wrong decision when he joined them five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the @entity16 for @entity0 i am disappointed @entity30 is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a @entity150 qualifier this week			1
even more worrying , repeated pull - outs from the @entity2 21 squads mean he 's way down the pecking order , even with injuries this week			2
he should be spearheading our charge to the @entity112 in the @entity156 this summer			0
the ongoing debate about @entity159 talent failing to develop after promising early signs needs to look at examples like @entity30			2
all the ability , but no significant strides made			0
he should have made that progression			0
the fact that he has n't is down to @entity32 being a complete basket case of a club			1
let 's hope for @entity30 's sake – and @entity0 's – the next chapter for @entity32 will help him become the player he should be .			1

@entity30 's career was flying while he was at @entity173
joining @entity32 has proved to be a catastrophic career move
one of @entity30 's former managers said he needs a ' slap in the face '
@entity30 has not progressed as @entity32 are a basket case of a club
