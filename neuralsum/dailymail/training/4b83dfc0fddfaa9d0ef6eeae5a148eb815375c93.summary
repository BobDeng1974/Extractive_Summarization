the red squirrel is a @entity2 native but the little animal is quickly becoming a rare sight in our gardens			1
only five per cent of @entity2 have ever spotted a red squirrel outside their home , a new wildlife survey has found			1
and only 2.7 per cent said they see a red squirrel on a monthly basis			1
a fifth of @entity2 have never spotted a squirrel in their back garden , a wildlife survey by @entity14 revealed the results also found that you would be more likely to spot a squirrel living in rural @entity21 - a stronghold for the species but those living in the @entity24 have less than a one per cent chance of seeing the animal			1
the figures were released after 274,000 homeowners took part in the @entity14 's @entity31 survey			0
the project has tracked garden birds every year since 1976 - but this is the first time the @entity14 has asked participants about other wildlife			0
the map shows the distribution of squirrels across the @entity39			2
in 2010 , red and grey squirrels no longer populate the east of @entity42			2
the map also illustrates that the red squirrel population has continued to grow in @entity21 @entity14 conservation scientist dr @entity45 described the figures as ' shocking '			1
he said : ' we all know that red squirrels have been threatened for a long time , but these figures are quite shocking			0
' the comment came after the survey found that invasive @entity52 grey squirrels are seen in 90 per cent of gardens			2
the number of red squirrels has dwindled after the species was hit by a pox virus , carried by the grey squirrel			1
the red squirrel also requires more dense woodland than the grey			1
the map shows that red squirrels were prevalent across the @entity39 in 1945 a hedgehog snuffling up to the back door was also once a common sight - but it is rapidly becoming a thing of the past			1
one in five people have never seen hedgehogs in their gardens , the survey found			2
the startling figures confirm conservationists ' fears - that the small @entity2 mammal is suffering a huge decline			0
scientists think there are now fewer than a million hedgehogs in the @entity39 , a 30 per cent fall since 2003			1
the survey found that 21 per cent of people never see hedgehogs at all , and only 28 per cent spot them more than once a month			1
two thirds of participants never see badgers , a quarter never see common toads and 93 per cent never see red squirrels			1
@entity45 , @entity14 conservation scientist , said the survey showed how important gardens were for wildlife			0
he added : ' it is a big concern that so many people never see hedgehogs , a species that is so familiar to us			2
' the fact that they are not seen regularly even in rural gardens is quite troubling			0
' this is the first time we have included wider species in our annual survey			0
the results provide a baseline for us to monitor how hedgehogs do over the next few years			0
' the reasons behind hedgehogs ' decline are unclear , but ecologists think the loss of the woodlands and hedgerows where they live , the building of new roads and houses , and the fragmentation of the countryside could all be to blame			0
the common frog leaped into first place as the most abundant garden amphibian - with half of people in the @entity39 recording that they saw one at least monthly , regardless of whether they lived in a rural , suburban or urban area			1
part of the reason behind the decline of the red squirrel has been put down to a deadly virus carried by the grey squirrel			1
@entity14 scientist @entity45 described the five per cent figure as ' shocking ' a wildlife expert said : ' the fact that they are not seen regularly even in rural gardens is quite troubling ' in contrast , toads were seen by only 28 per cent of people monthly and numbers have declined , especially in central and southern @entity42			1
the creatures are more likely to be seen in gardens in rural areas , where 41 per cent of householders recording that they saw toads on a monthly basis			1
animal charities are trying to encourage people to provide space for wildlife in their gardens , whether by building a hedgehog box , putting up bird feeder , or finding a space for a pond			2
@entity158 , of the @entity159 , said : ' we know that only a minority of gardens are regularly used by hedgehogs - one species we 're particularly concerned about			0
' with numbers falling in the wider countryside , doing more to encourage hedgehogs into the green spaces around our homes and places of work could make a big difference			0
' worrying : two thirds of participants never see badgers , while a quarter claimed they never see common toads the @entity179 @entity178 is one of many initiatives in the @entity39 that aims to reintroduce the native red squirrel			1
the last native red squirrel was seen in the county in 1984			2
but as @entity179 has large areas of mixed woodland and valleys , it is an ideal habitat for red squirrels			0
in 2009 , the project was founded and began with a cull of grey squirrels			0
this will be followed by the reintroductions of red squirrels to @entity195 and @entity196			0
surrounded by the sea on both sides , these areas are more easily defended from re-population by grey squirrels			0
at the same time , a cull of grey squirrels was carried out in the area to give the red squirrels a chance to reclaim their habitat			2
removing grey squirrels also allowed trees and woodland to grow back - the grey squirrels strip the bark from the stems of trees , causing huge damage to biodiversity			0
the project is supported by the @entity218 , whose patron is hrh the @entity221 , and the @entity222 .			0
