by @entity1 reporter published : 16:20 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 03:15 est , 1 march 2014 its a project that involved 9,534 photographs taken over 27 years			1
and artist @entity6 has no plans of stopping the ongoing visual document he first thought up as a student in 1975 , and which has culminated in a stunning time lapse film showing the process of aging			1
' i ’ll stop when i ’m dead , ' he told @entity14			2
' if i ’m dead , i wo n’t know what will happen with [ my project ] from there , but the plan is to have an institution acquire it in some form			2
' @entity6 is now 61 and he started ' @entity22 ' - which is usually updated daily online - at 34 - years - old			1
@entity39 said it also serves as a ' meta comment ' on the idea of obsession , and doing something repetitiously			2
' artists need to be obsessive to get the work that they have to get done , done , ' he said			2
' they have to have some inner drive to do it ; this is taking it to another step			1
this is a comment on the obsession and obsessively making work			2
' the idea of making and taking photographs has a lot to do with documenting things over time			1
' many people have attempted that in terms of looking at cities , and locations , or even one ’s own family — kids growing up , that sort of thing			0
' so i felt that it might be interesting to take it a step further			0
' the process for ' @entity22 ' has been something reminiscent of @entity74			0
@entity6 wakes up , gets ready for work or the weekend , and then simply snaps the photo using the same camera and the same lighting that he has used for nearly three decades			1
the type of film has changed over time , he said , because the older products he once relied on are no longer made			1
' i do n’t do anything to change my face intentionally			0
i do n’t grow beards or mustaches , and i keep my hair the same , ' he said			0
' i do n’t use any unusual angles , and i do n’t use any unusual lenses , or filters , or lighting sources			0
' i try to keep all artistic conceits out of the picture			0
' i try to achieve identical images , but i ca n’t always , because i ’m human , and i make mistakes , and the camera makes mistakes			1
' those are all accepted as part of the project			0
' @entity6 said he could only remember one time that he forgot to take a portrait of himself , when he was rushing out the house to teach a class			1
once he takes a photo , he collects the negatives and keeps them organized and well documented in a safe place , and brings them out when he needs to make prints , or in the case of one undertaking , he made to show the progression of age : a video			0
the latest video had to be edited extensively , with only about 2000 - 2,500 of the 9,543 pictures being featured			1
the video , which has been uploaded to @entity116 , is called it aint over yet : 24 years , 8 months , 11 days , in 2 minutes .			0

@entity6 started taking a single shot of his in the *morning* on february *23* , 1987
