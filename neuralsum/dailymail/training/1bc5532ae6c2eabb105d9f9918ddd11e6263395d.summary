by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:52 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 22 november 2013 desperate attempts by @entity4 to distance @entity5 from the @entity7 scandal foundered last night as startling new evidence emerged of the intimate ties between the party and the stricken lender			1
the shadow chancellor angrily attacked what he branded a ' smear ' campaign over @entity5 ’s connections with disgraced former co-op boss @entity17 , who is under police investigation for allegedly buying crack cocaine and crystal meth			1
mr @entity4 insisted that @entity17 , a former business adviser to leader @entity21 , was ' out , out , out ' of the @entity5			1
corridors of power : @entity17 attends a @entity24 reception in 2010 under the last government but questions intensified over the opposition 's cosy relationship with the bank after it emerged that mr @entity4 had bragged about his role in rubber - stamping legislation that paved the way for a disastrous takeover deal at the @entity36 op. he also accepted a £ 50,000 donation from the group in march 2012 , when @entity17 was the bank ’s chairman			1
there were also mounting questions about the extraordinary special treatment the bank gave to @entity5 - extending ' soft ' loans with preferential rates of interest and admitting that other clients would never be allowed to keep on borrowing so much			2
when @entity5 was on the brink of bankruptcy , then general secretary @entity48 had a meeting with a senior co-op executive at which it was agreed that vast debts would not be called in			2
on another dramatic day in the spiralling scandal : mr @entity21 yesterday hit back at what aides said was a concerted @entity59 smear campaign over the extent of the @entity5 leadership ’s links with @entity17			1
' what this episode shows is more about the character of the prime minister than about the character of @entity5 ’s relationship with the co-op , ' he said			1
' smeared ' ? @entity4 tried his best to distance himself from @entity17 today ' we have a prime minister who , when he sees a serious situation at the bank , tries to make cheap political points rather than sorting it out			1
' and in a series of increasingly bad - tempered tv and radio interviews , mr @entity4 insisted that he had known nothing about the allegations concerning the @entity82 chairman			1
he said @entity17 had been suspended from @entity5 membership and was ' out , out , out '			2
mr @entity4 said he would not repay a £ 50,000 donation his office received from the @entity86 – saying he was ' proud ' to have received it			1
he claimed the donation had nothing to do with @entity90 , even though the former bank boss told mps this month that he had helped to arrange it			2
' i am proud to have that donation , ' the @entity94 insisted			2
' they made a donation to me last year which i am very proud of and was properly declared			0
' mr @entity4 rejected @entity101 calls for him to repay the cash , insisting : ' i have not got £ 50,000 in my office to give back and i do n’t think it would be the right thing to do			1
@entity5 past : @entity17 celebrates winning a seat in the 2008 local elections he denied discussing the donation with @entity90 , saying : ' i have never in my life had a conversation with @entity17 about that matter or any other			1
@entity17 was not involved in that in any way			0
' challenged about @entity17 ’s evidence to @entity92 , mr @entity4 suggested it could not be trusted			1
' he was someone who was buying drugs and engaged with rent boys , ' he said			0
' he has made a lot of allegations			0
there is no truth in that at all			0
' however , the @entity94 faced fresh questions as it emerged that he boasted in 2010 that as a minister in the last government , he had ensured @entity128 support for a ' super-mutual ' deal which saw the co-op merge with @entity131			2
as a result of the failed takeover , thousands of small investors face losses , 50 branches could close and job losses will be in the thousands			0
when he was trying to win the @entity5 leadership contest , mr @entity4 said : ' i promoted co-operatives throughout my time in government ... i was able to show this by ensuring @entity128 support for a new private member ’s @entity145 that led to the creation of the first ever “ super-mutual ” , bringing @entity131 and the @entity82 together in the interests of customers , rather than the banking elite			1
' conservative mp @entity151 said : ' this raises serious concerns about @entity4 ’s relationship with the @entity82 and the role he played in this merger			2
it also proves a sham of recent attempts by mr @entity4 to distance himself from the @entity82			1
' a spokesman for mr @entity4 said : ' the decision by the @entity82 in 2009 to merge with the @entity131 was a commercial one for the bank which @entity4 had absolutely no involvement in			1
' former general secretary mr @entity48 ’s memoirs give further evidence of the special treatment afforded by the bank to @entity5			1
recalling a meeting as he sought to fend off bankruptcy for the party in 2006 , he says a co-op executive told him : ' i ’m coming under huge pressure at my end to demonstrate that we ’re not going to lose all our money			0
under normal circumstances , with other clients , we would not even be having this conversation			0
we ’d just pull the plug			0
' one well - placed source said : ' why did the co-op allow the party to get into that level of debt ? in 2005 the party really overspent and had a multi-million pound overdraft from the @entity36 op. ' the overdraft essentially stayed the same			2
there was no requirement to reduce it			0
' some of the account managers were uncomfortable at the levels of the debt the party was being given			0
the party was in serious trouble , it had no capital - there was nothing to underwrite			0
there ’s no doubt that preferential treatment was given because of the political friendship			0
' @entity17 has enjoyed a host of high - profile roles over the past 20 years in the @entity5 , the @entity210 , charities and the @entity86			1
they include : chairman of the co-op bankjoined the board in 2008 then appointed chairman in april 2010 on a salary of £ 132,000			2
stepped down in june 2013			0
also deputy chairman of the @entity86			0
trustee of investment funds and property at the @entity210 churchstarted work as a @entity210 minister as a graduate in 1976			0
suspended indefinitely on wednesday ahead of an investigation by church officials and is expected to face a disciplinary hearing			0
superintendent at @entity210 member of @entity5 ’s financial and industrial advisory boardappointed 2010			1

chairman of @entity233 , the city ’s chamber orchestra appointed in september 2012 , he was chairman for only ' a brief spell ' , according to a spokesman			2
chairman of the @entity239 , a charity which helps drug @entity241 1992 - 2004 , when he left after allegedly submitting false expenses			1
trustee of the @entity246 , an @entity248 member from 2011 until he resigned this week			0
member of the board at @entity251 vice-chairman of the @entity253 of citizens ’ @entity255 @entity5 councillor in @entity257 2002 , resigned in september 2011 after pornography was found on his laptop .			0
