by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 21 september 2013 as @entity2 was labelled a liar by a parliamentary committee , it was not only sections of the @entity7 newsroom that cheered in agreement			1
for watching a recording of the mauling was @entity11 , her third husband			1
speaking for the first time about their marriage , mr @entity11 claims he fell ‘ completely and madly in love ’ with the £ 320,000 - a - year executive before being ‘ written out of her life ’			1
' lipgloss ' @entity20 on her honeymoon in the @entity22 after marrying third husband , @entity11 head of sales in the @entity25 for a multinational optical firm , mr @entity11 , who earns a six - figure salary , met ms @entity20 in september 2008 and they were instantly attracted to each other after their first date at a dancing class			1
‘ she did salsa but i wanted to learn how to do ballroom dancing and she jumped straight in , ’ the 51 - year - old recalled			2
‘ i could tell there was something between us and i was attracted to her			2
‘ i went to meet her at her house in @entity41 two nights after and never really left			2
’ mr @entity11 said it soon became clear that ms @entity20 , who has a daughter from a previous marriage , had expensive tastes , as proved when the pair got engaged			1
‘ it was @entity49 on the beach in @entity51			2
i remember being very nervous and i picked a ring , which cost £ 200 , the same day			1
‘ the first thing she did when she got back was go to @entity55 and buy a new ring			1
i never saw the receipt but i reckon it must have cost between £ 15,000 and £ 20,000			2
the wedding of @entity20 and @entity11 in 2009 which cost £ 20,000 according to mr @entity11 she just said she ’d always wanted a ring with massive diamonds and would i mind ? i was n’t really thinking that straight because i was so in love with her			1
i did n’t question it , i just thought if that ’s what she wants to do let her get on with it			2
she had it cut the same way as the ring i gave her , but obviously you do n’t get much of a diamond for £ 200			1
’ mr @entity11 , who has been married three times and has two children from his first marriage , added ms @entity20 certainly lived up to her ‘ lipgloss ’ nickname and the couple had a ‘ fairytale wedding ’ when they tied the knot in december 2009 in @entity87 , @entity88			1
‘ @entity20 wanted a winter wedding with candles everywhere			2
it cost about £ 20,000			2
then we had a really expensive ten - day honeymoon in the @entity22 and the villa cost about £ 1,200 a night , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d never heard of the expression @entity20 but it ’s not one i ’d disagree with			2
she ’d never go anywhere without make - up			2
i bought her a £ 150 tub of face cream once as a present from @entity102 and she just kept on buying it			2
‘ and she had an entire bedroom at her home turned into a dressing room where she kept all her designer handbags and shoes			1
most of her bags came from @entity102 and @entity110			0
she must have had around 25 , costing £ 1,000 upwards			0
’ ms @entity20 , who was overseeing a major overhaul at the @entity7 , could have been excused for losing sleep			1
but mr @entity11 confessed it was more mundane marriage problems that kept her awake at night			1
‘ she oversaw massive changes to the @entity7 pension system as well as pay freezes and job cuts			1
but none of that really fazed her			0
what seemed to upset her more was my snoring , ’ he said			0
the end of their brief marriage still haunts @entity11 after he found out about her affair with pr director @entity133			1
and he says since their split in the summer of 2011 they have had just one conversation and exchanged a handful of texts			0
‘ about three weeks before i found out , i was sitting in a @entity141 restaurant in @entity88 with her and said , “ is there anything i should know about ? something does n’t seem right			0
” and she said , “ absolutely not ”			0
‘ but it was only when i was in @entity147 that i actually discovered her lover ’s underpants			1
i was going through the dirty washing and his white boxer shorts were in the laundry basket			0
i also found a boarding ticket with both their names on and i looked him up on the internet			0
mr @entity11 says he was ' written out ' of his ex-wife 's life after discovering she was having an affair with pr director @entity133 ‘ i left them on her side of the bed			1
she did n’t say a word and i thought , “ if you have had an affair i ’m not going to beg you to stay so get on with it			1
” a few days later she finally said , “ you left them there and you did n’t say anything			0
if you want a conversation , have a conversation			0
” ‘ it felt like she was just rubbing my nose in it			1
we loved that place – it was in the hills overlooking @entity51			0
i found it but we both picked it together			0
and she took him there			0
‘ the very same day @entity20 told me i went to see a solicitor and said i wanted a divorce			0
i only found out later she ’s still with the same guy			0
that betrayal knocked me for six and it ’s taken a long time to get over			0
‘ i ’ve got a new girlfriend but i know i ’m difficult to live with and find myself swinging between not caring and being over-controlling and i ’m sure that ’s because of what @entity20 did			0
’ the divorce papers acknowledge ms @entity20 ’s affair ended the marriage			1
mr @entity11 said he accepted £ 25,000 cash to clear debts while she kept the £ 200,000 two - bed flat in @entity147			1
he said : ‘ i knew she was a piece of work but i never honestly believed she would do anything like that			0
she said she was madly , deeply in love with me , like i was with her			0

i did n’t know how well paid she was			2
she kept it a secret for the first few months			0
