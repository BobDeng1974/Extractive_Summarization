by @entity0 he may be able to fly - but this @entity2 @entity1 appears to have trouble finding the shops			1
joker @entity5 was filmed apparently flying along outside the window of a workman 's moving van in the stunted - up video shot on a country road outside @entity11 near @entity12			1
the film - which shows the ' superhero ' asking for directions - has been viewed thousands of times around the world after it was posted online earlier this week			1
it 's a wee friday			2
' the camera then pans to the driver 's left to show mr @entity5 , 24 , in a @entity1 - pose outside the passenger - side window			1
as bushes and trees hurtle past , he manages to stiffle his giggles as he calmly chats to the driver			0
he says : ' excuse me , how do i get to the shops from here , boys ? ' to which the laughing driver replies ' stick to the left '			0
@entity44 mr @entity5 then says ' all right buddy , is that me then ' and ' cheerio ' before appearing to fly off away from the van			2
the video has since been sent around the world by internet users , attracting scores of comments			0
@entity52 tweeted ' @entity53 at its best ...			0
@entity55 ' , @entity54 wrote ' great , just flipping great			0
. good on you guys			0
. ﻿ ' and @entity58 added ' hilarious '			0
mr @entity5 has said the van slowed down and he was cycling alongside , but a frame of the video appears to show the van 's side door open and his hand holding onto the passenger seat 's head - rest			1
mr @entity5 chats to the driver as the van heads along a country road in near @entity11 , @entity2			1
after getting directions to the shops , he bids the driver ' @entity72 ' before turning and appearing to fly off he told the @entity74 : ' we used to make a lot of videos so we just did it for a bit of a laugh			0
the idea just popped into my head one day and i thought i ’d try it out			0
' but motoring groups have criticised the move , with @entity87 president @entity86 saying : ' @entity1 should stick to the big screen rather than doing dangerous stunts on rural roads			2
' whether he is going along on a bike or hanging out of the side door , the van would only have to hit a pothole and his super strength would be severely tested			1
' following the commments , mr @entity5 urged others not to copy his act , adding : ' they should leave it to the real @entity100			2
' after the stunt was criticised by safety groups , mr @entity5 said flying should be left to the real @entity100 , played here by @entity105 in the 1978 film			1
