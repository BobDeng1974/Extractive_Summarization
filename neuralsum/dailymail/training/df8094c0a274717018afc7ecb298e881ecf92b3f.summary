rising star @entity0 and @entity1 shared a century stand to preserve @entity4 ' chances of drawing the second unofficial test against @entity6 the fourth - wicket pair joined forces still 80 runs behind , after @entity10 and @entity11 had departed in quick succession following their own 77 - run partnership on day three of four in @entity14			1
@entity0 ( 61no ) and @entity1 ( 53 ) responded by keeping the home attack at bay for almost 29 overs , the captain reaching his half - century with his seventh four off the 80th ball he faced before being lbw to test off - spinner @entity17 to end a stand of 115			0
@entity1 , pictured on saturday during @entity4 practice , scored 53 on the third day @entity1 and @entity0 ( pictured ) put on 115 runs as the rising star closed on 61 not out heavy rain and bad light restricted play after tea , the @entity4 eventually closing on 212 for four - but only 51 in front - with @entity0 still unbeaten , having completed his 110 - ball 50 with his ninth boundary			1
seamers @entity31 ( four for 78 ) and @entity32 ( three for 75 ) were earlier both in the wickets again as the hosts , resuming on 389 for seven , were all out for 421			0
@entity1 's tourists conceded a lead of 161 and were almost immediately in more trouble when @entity40 opener @entity38 edged @entity41 on to his stumps for a golden duck , his second single - figure failure of the match			0
captain @entity1 and @entity0 ensure @entity4 go into the final day with a realistic chance of earning a draw @entity48 @entity31 took four for 78 as @entity49 scored 421 in the second innings @entity51 and @entity11 tried to effect a lasting recovery , but the @entity4 were 81 for three after the @entity54 left - handers fell in the space of two overs to teenage seamer @entity57			1
@entity10 edged an attempted drive to slip , and then @entity11 was bowled off his pads			0
much therefore depended on @entity1 and @entity0 , who did not disappoint and made a stalemate marginally the most likely outcome on the final day - a result which would close out a 0 - 0 drawn series .			2

@entity1 scored 53 runs on third day against @entity49
rising star @entity0 closed the day on 61 not out
the pair put on 115 runs as @entity4 go into final day 212 for 4
