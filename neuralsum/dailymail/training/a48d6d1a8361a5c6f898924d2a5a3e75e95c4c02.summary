the chairman of the @entity38 , @entity37 , admitted none of the allegations in the @entity10 dossier had been proven but said they gave the impression of @entity4 being a ' deeply corrupt organisation '			1
' today we have published the latest evidence ( the @entity10 ) have given to us which does suggest that the ( @entity47 ) themselves compiled a very substantial amount of information suggesting corrupt practices in the process , ' he told @entity52			1
' also suggesting that @entity2 was involved in some kind of collusion as well during that process			2
these are questions that need to be answered			0

' when we last spoke to the @entity47 we asked whether or not they had any further evidence of corrupt practices and they said they did n't			1
' so that in itself is worrying because it now appears that they were sitting on this dossier which contains substantial evidence			2
' i think they were obviously reluctant to reveal what had been going on in terms of the investigations and obviously a lot of it is reports and hearsay			0
it is n't necessarily hard evidence , it is n't proven			0
' but nonetheless , when it is taken together with all the other evidence that has already been accumulated it does paint a picture of ( @entity4 as ) a deeply corrupt organisation and that the whole of the @entity61 bidding process was completely flawed			2
