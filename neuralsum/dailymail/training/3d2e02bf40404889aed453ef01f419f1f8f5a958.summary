by @entity0 published : 20:03 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 20:05 est , 10 june 2013 victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court - by giving their evidence before the trial			1
they will be allowed to record their testimony on video in advance of the case going to court , justice secretary @entity11 will say today			1
the move follows a series of cases in which sex abuse victims have been put through hostile questioning by defence barristers			1
in one case a rape victim who was abused by a sex grooming gang from the age of 13 endured 12 days of questioning in a ‘ forensic examination ’			1
another vulnerable victim in the same case had to read out line by line from a police statement she gave detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather			1
a series of pilots will see vulnerable victims given the chance to give evidence out of court with the footage played to the jury			1
the announcement will please victims ’ groups who have warned that children have been ‘ thrown to the wolves ’ in court			1
but the move could raise concerns among lawyers over whether defendants are getting a fair trial - and whether the evidence used against them is properly scrutinised			1
mr @entity11 said it was wrong for young and vulnerable victims to have to relive their experiences for days on end in an ‘ aggressive and intimidating court atmosphere ’			2
‘ the particularly hostile treatment of victims and witnesses in court has nothing to do with fairness or justice , ’ he said			1
‘ it is simply not right that young and vulnerable victims are forced to relive the most traumatic experience they have ever had , often for days on end , when cross-examined in court			2
‘ i am adamant we must put a stop to this , but without compromising everyone ’s right to a fair trial			2
‘ so for the first time we are going to spare these victims from the aggressive and intimidating court atmosphere by making sure they can give evidence and be cross-examined before the trial starts			2
’ details of the treatment in court of several victims of a sex grooming gang sparked fury earlier this year			1
the pilots will take place at three @entity88 in @entity89 ( pictured ) , @entity90 - upon - @entity91 and @entity92 from later this year the 18 - year - old , who had been attacked from the age of 13 , was quizzed aggressively about her sex life during the harrowing trial over 12 days in the witness box			1
she broke down after being repeatedly accused of lying by lawyers acting for seven men on trial and at one point was accused of being ‘ naughty ’			0
one barrister reportedly walked out of the trial in disgust over the treatment of another witness at the @entity108 trial in 2011			0
the seven men were convicted of child sex offences against four girls in later retrials after the case collapsed			2
the pilots will take place at three @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90 - upon - @entity91 and @entity92 from later this year			1
if successful , it will be extended to courts across @entity118 and @entity119			0
victims will still be cross examined , but via videolink and away from the drama and audience of a court trial , officials said			2
by separating testimony from the main court case , the move could give judges greater control over methods of cross-examination			1
however , there will still be no limit on the number of lawyers who can cross examine a victim or witness , how long they can be in the witness box or the material on which they can be questioned			0
officials suggested it would also ensure victims could be given counselling earlier , without the long delays often found in the courts			0
the change in the law will affect all child victims and witnesses and adult victims seen as the ‘ most vulnerable ’ , and allow them to escape a courtroom grilling in front of an audience			0
questions were raised about cross-examination when a violinist killed herself after she was branded a liar and fantasist by her attacker ’s lawyer			0
@entity163 , 48 , died from an overdose half - way through the trial of choirmaster @entity167 , music director at @entity168 in the mid- 1990s , and his ex-wife @entity169 , both 68			0
@entity170 , who represented mr @entity167 , told mrs andrade ‘ you have told this jury a complete pack of lies about the visit to this house ’			0
during one exchange , the victim said ‘ this feels like rape all over again ’			0
a week later she was found dead at home			0
her family said they were convinced the court ordeal lead to her death			0
but the judge in the case said the barrister ’s conduct had been exemplary and her questions ‘ perfectly proper and completely professional ’			0
@entity192 , chief executive of the @entity193 said : ‘ this pilot is one step towards making courts child friendly and starting to remove the gladiatorial element of cross examination			0
it could also mean young people wo n’t have to testify years after they come forward allowing victims to start to rebuild their lives earlier			0
“ many young victims of abuse tell us how the current process can be almost as horrific as the abuse itself			2
‘ cases have been dropped because the witnesses were too vulnerable to cope with the aggressive cross exanimation in court by several different barristers			1
