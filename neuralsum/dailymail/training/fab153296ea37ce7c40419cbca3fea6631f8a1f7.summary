two @entity1 - winning sides came together to celebrate @entity3 midfielder @entity2 's testimonial on friday , marking the end of the career of one of @entity9 's greatest midfielders of the 21st century			1
the game , featuring the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , ended 4 - 4 , with @entity16 scoring twice and @entity2 getting the decisive strike for @entity18 having played for both sides			1
on an emotional occasion the @entity3 playmaker nipped in with a tidy finish in the 89th minute , which proved to be the last touch of the game			0
but @entity16 's cheeky antics were what had most people talking			0
goals : @entity72 3 ; @entity14 15 ; @entity71 62 ; @entity2 89			1
@entity41 : @entity74 , @entity63 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity61 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 ( @entity2 46 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 46 ) , @entity13 ( @entity12 46 )			2
goals : @entity16 54 , 68 ; @entity2 57 , @entity12 81 the centre forward , who spearheaded @entity41 's attack in 2006 , was on top form			1
the first of his two goals came after he waited on the goalline for a defender to catch him before tapping in			0
and even before the game he was posing for the camera 's as the camera panned across the assembled stars , which bizarrely included @entity77 despite him only playing for @entity41 in 2004			2
but the evening was all about @entity2 - he ended up scoring and setting up goals for both sides on a fitting end to a trophy - heavy career that took in time with both of these sides as well as @entity103			2
@entity72 , @entity14 scored for @entity18 as they raced into a 2 - 0 first half lead , and @entity71 also bagged for the @entity3 side			1
@entity12 scored @entity41 's third on the night , converting a rare header from an @entity16 cross			1
but it was of course left to @entity2 to finish it off , placing a brilliant finish off the the underside of the bar ( in a @entity18 shirt this time ) to make it 4 - 4 before the referee recognised the ideal time to blow the final whistle and pull the curtain down on @entity2 's time in football			2
afterwards , @entity12 paid tribute to the man of the occasion			0
' @entity2 deserved this , both as a footballer and as a person , ' he said			0
' he â€™s a player i learned a lot from , as did so many other team - mates			0
there was no way i was going to miss this event			0

@entity167 superstar @entity166 was *supposed* to attend but did *n't* end up making it to the @entity34 do @entity34
