@entity0 have made an £ 2million loan fee offer to @entity2 for winger @entity3 with view to a £ 10m permanent deal			1
@entity6 and @entity7 have also shown an interest in the @entity10 23 - year - old			2
earlier this week , however , former @entity12 international @entity11 warned @entity3 against moving to @entity13			1
they are less obsessed with tactics there , but a move to @entity6 right now could not be more unsuitable			2
' they are in a crisis and can not really have any ambitions this year			0
joining them from @entity2 , who expect to win titles every season , would be a culture shock			0
' @entity11 also did not speak too highly of the prospect of @entity3 moving to @entity37 he said : ' not only because @entity37 is the weakest of all the big leagues , but above all because they play so tactically there			1
' when i look at the clubs who are interested in @entity44 , there are clear preferences for me and @entity0 would be a disaster			2
' @entity23 needs freedom to express himself			0
furthermore , with such a transfer , the expectations would be for him to make the difference immediately			0
patience is in short supply in @entity52			0
' @entity3 has been warned against a move to @entity54 ' @entity6			1

@entity3 is wanted by @entity0 in *january*
the @entity2 winger has also interested @entity6
but @entity3 has been *advised* against moving to @entity13
