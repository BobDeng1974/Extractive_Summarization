anyone hoping to one day emulate the likes of time travellers @entity3 or @entity4 in @entity5 has just been dealt a devastating blow			1
researchers from @entity8 have scoured websites , search engine results and social networks dating back as far as 1996 in search of people who discussed select events before they happened			1
they even asked time travellers from the future to tweet using a specific hashtag			2
yet despite comprehensive analysis of thousands of records , they were unable to find any evidence time travellers existed			1
anyone hoping to emulate the likes of time travellers @entity23 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) in @entity5 have been dealt a devastating blow			2
researchers from @entity8 scoured web results back to january 1996 in search of people who discussed events before they happened - yet found nothing travelling through time may not be the far - fetched science fiction theory it was once thought to be , according to professor @entity32			1
' if you go fast , your clock runs slow relative to people who are still			0
' as you approach the speed of light , your clock runs so slow you could come back 10,000 years in the future			0
' the theory is based on @entity42 's theory of @entity43 that states to travel forward in time , an object would need to reach speeds close to the speed of light			0
however , he said this theory only works when travelling to the future , and it 's not possible to come back			0
he added that if the technology was developed to accelerate larger objects , it could be possible for humans to travel to the future , similar to @entity3 's @entity53 in the tv show			0
yet this technology does n't exist yet , and will never exist that could take people to the past			0
since the late 1800s , writers and filmmakers have been obsessed with the allure and intrigue of time travel from @entity63 ’ 1895 book @entity65 to the @entity5 franchise and @entity3			0
inspired by this fascination , professor @entity68 , along with a @entity70 graduate @entity69 , wanted to use the web to try and find evidence of people from the future living among us			0
they began by selecting two events from recent history - the @entity79 in september 2012 and the appointment of @entity81 in march 2013			1
they then scanned websites and search engine results for conversations or references to these events made between january 2006 and september 2013			1
' were a time traveller from the future to access the internet of the past few years , they might have left once - prescient content that persists today , ’ explained @entity68 and @entity93			2
' such content might have been catalogued by search engines such as @entity96 or @entity97 , or remain in posts left on @entity99 , @entity100 or @entity101			0
' they spent months researching and scanning these sites for mentions of the comet and @entity81 before the respective events took place , but concluded there was no ‘ clearly prescient ’ mention of either			1
to verify evidence of time travellers , the researchers choose two events from recent history - the @entity79 in september 2012 , left , and the appointment of @entity81 in march 2013 , right			1
they then scanned websites for prescient conversations or references to these events dating back to january 2006 they then asked time travellers to send tweets using either hashtags ‘ @entity124 ’ or ‘ @entity125 ’ before the end of august 2013			1
the request was deliberately made in september in the hope that a time traveller would see the tweet in the future before travelling back to the past to tweet it before the end of august			0
however , no tweets were sent that predated the original request			0
' no time travellers were discovered , ' said the researchers			2
' although these negative results do not disprove time travel , given the great reach of the internet , this search is perhaps the most comprehensive to date			2
' the researchers only searched for time travellers from the future because firstly , the results could be verified , and secondly , as @entity68 explained : ‘ to the best of our knowledge , human technology to create a time machine does not exist in the past , so that time travellers from the past must originate in the future , assuming such technology is ever developed			1

*physicists* scanned websites , search engine results , tweets and emails
they were looking for prescient references about select events
these *included* @entity79 in 2012 and @entity81 ’ appointment in 2013
study found no evidence of time travellers and claim it 's unlikely they exist
