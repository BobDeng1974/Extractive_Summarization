after riding in a self - driving @entity1 to @entity3 headquarters on tuesday , gov @entity0 signed legislation paving the way for driverless cars throughout the state of @entity8			1
the bill by @entity11 sen. @entity10 will establish safety and performance regulations to test and operate similar autonomous vehicles on state roads and highways with the vehicles expected to hit the market in a decade			1
' today we 're looking at science fiction becoming tomorrow 's reality - the self - driving car , ' @entity0 said			0
' anyone who gets inside a car and finds out the car is driving will be a little skittish , but they 'll get over it			0
the company 's fleet of a dozen computer - controlled vehicles has logged more than 300,000 miles of self - driving without an accident , according to @entity3			1
' i think the self - driving car can really dramatically improve the quality of life for everyone , ' @entity3 co-founder @entity38 said			1
autonomous cars can make roads safer , free commuters from the drudgery of driving , reduce congestion and provide transport to people who ca n't drive themselves , such as the blind , disabled , elderly and intoxicated , @entity38 said			2
' i expect that self - driving cars will be far safer than human - driven cars , ' @entity38 said			1
the future : @entity55 signed the bill that will work to establish safety and performance regulations to test and operate similar autonomous vehicles on state roads and highways laser eyes : the vehicles ' lidar system , pictured , operates it using laser radar technology along with various other computer sensors @entity38 predicted that autonomous vehicles will be commercially available within a decade			1
he said @entity3 has no plans to produce its own cars , but instead plans to partner with the automobile industry to develop autonomous vehicles			1
the @entity73 expressed concern that @entity8 is moving too quickly to embrace self - driving cars and needs to first sort out liability issues			2
' unfortunately this legislation lacks any provision protecting an automaker whose car is converted to an autonomous operation vehicle without the consent or even knowledge of that auto manufacturer , ' the trade group said in a statement			0
autonomous cars use computers , sensors and other technology to operate independently , but a human driver can override the autopilot function and take control of the vehicle at any time			1
with smartphone - wielding drivers more distracted than ever , backers say robotic vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce collisions and traffic fatalities , noting that nearly all car accidents are a result of human error			2
the legislation requires the @entity107 to draft regulations for autonomous vehicles by jan. 1 , 2015			2
currently , state law does n't mention self - driving cars because the technology is so new			1
the regulations would allow vehicles to operate autonomously , but a licensed driver would still need to sit behind the wheel to serve as a backup operator in case of emergency			2
the legislation also is aimed at keeping @entity8 at the forefront of the autonomous car industry since @entity123 and @entity124 companies have been working on the technology for years			2
report card : a @entity3 self - driving car is seen parked outside @entity3 headquarters , one of a fleet that the company says have undergone more than 300,000 miles of self - driving without an accident manufactures : the technology placed inside a seen @entity1 is one of several car makers working on autonomous car technology , including @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 in february , @entity142 became the first @entity144 state to approve regulations spelling out requirements for companies to test driverless cars on that state 's roads			1
carmakers such as @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 have been working on autonomous car technology for years			0
in recent years , automakers also have been introducing autonomous functions such as self - parking , lane departure warnings and adaptive cruise - control , which allows vehicles to automatically accelerate and decelerate with the flow of traffic			0
outside a cafe in @entity163 , customers said they looked forward to a day when their cars could drive themselves , as long as they could do it safely			0
expectations : @entity3 co-founder , @entity38 , pictured beside @entity55 , believes self - driving cars will be safer than those driven by people , while expecting them on the market within the next decade ' it would make our streets safer , ' said @entity176 , 33 , an auto technician			1
' we would n't have to worry about people texting or getting sidetracked			0
the computer will take over , and it will make life easier			0
' @entity180 , a retired mechanical engineer who has vision problems , said self - driving cars would make his life easier , too			0
' if i could tell my car , " ok , you take over when it 's dark , " and i do n't have to worry about it , that would be fantastic , ' said @entity180 , who lives in nearby @entity184			0
' it 's a good idea			0
why not make progress if it 's possible ? ' watch the video here :			0

legislation is the first step toward developing safety and performance regulations for the driverless vehicles in the state
the vehicles are predicted to be commercially available within a decade
@entity3 , which has helped develop the technology , expects the cars to be safer than human - driven ones
@entity142 was the first @entity144 state to approve regulations for the vehicles in february
