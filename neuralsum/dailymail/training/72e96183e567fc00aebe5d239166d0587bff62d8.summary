one is cancer and the other is transplant			2
when we heard transplant , it completely took us aback and we were all over the place			2
' they said that without it he would get progressively worse rapidly , and we were already in hospital with him almost weekly with various complications			0
' we could have waited for someone to pass away and an organ to become available but we could see him getting worse so i enquired and learned about live donor transplants			0

@entity8 , and his wife @entity77 , 31 , were told of their son 's condition , something they had only ever associated with alcoholism and other complications mr @entity13 said : ' it was a very worrying time for my wife			1
she has her husband on one side and her son on the other ' the risks included blood clotting , internal bleeding , various infections and a 1 in 200 chance of death			2
mr @entity13 said : ' it was a very worrying time for my wife			1
she has her husband on one side and her son on the other			0
' i told her just to worry about him , and she did a fantastic job			0
people have called me brave , but she was the brave one			0
