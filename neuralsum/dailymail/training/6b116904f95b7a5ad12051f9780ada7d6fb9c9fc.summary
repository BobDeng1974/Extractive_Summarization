adults who watched a lot of television when they were children are more likely to be overweight , new research has found			0
for every extra hour a child spends watching tv each day , their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound			1
the researchers believe this could be because when children are watching television their hands are free so they are able to eat whatever they want - meaning they form bad habits			1
adults who watched a lot of television when they were children are more likely to be overweight ‘ the weight of the evidence is pretty strong that television viewing is related to unhealthy changes in weight among youth , ’ @entity23 , who led the research at the @entity25 , in @entity26 , said			0
she added : ‘ it 's important for parents to be aware of all the potentially obesogenic screens that they should really be limiting in their children 's lives			0
’ the researchers used data from a long - term study of children who filled in surveys every other year			0
the surveys included questions about their height and weight as well as how much time they spent watching tv and playing computer games			1
out of about 4,300 girls in the study , 17 per cent were overweight or obese			0
of the 3,500 boys , 24 per cent were above a healthy weight			0
for every extra hour a child spends watching tv each day , their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound from one survey to the next , each one - hour increase in children 's daily tv watching was tied to an increase of about 0.1 points on the body mass index ( @entity66 ) scale			1
dr @entity67 , director of @entity68 and @entity69 at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , told @entity73 : ‘ [ when children watch tv ] there is more purposeful , deliberate exposure to eating options , commercials that come on that might cue you to go off to the pantry and grab a cookie or a soft drink			2
‘ typically your hands are free when you 're watching tv , so should that temptation capture you , you 're able to sit there and munch on whether it 's a healthy or an unhealthy snack			1
’ dr @entity67 , who was not involved in the study , added that even playing computer games could be better than watching tv as it makes children a little bit more active and distracted from eating			1
many parents believe their children are getting a reasonable amount of recreational screen time , dr @entity67 said			0
but he added that most @entity102 and @entity72 children exceed the recommended two - hour maximum per day			2
‘ we do n't pay attention to the fact that it 's half an hour here , half an hour there , an hour here , an hour there , ’ dr @entity67 said .			2

for every extra hour a child spends watching tv each day , their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound - or 0.1 points on the @entity66 scale
could be because when people are watching tv their hands are *unoccupied* , so they get into the habit of *mindless* and *unnecessary* eating , say *experts*
even playing computer games could be better as it *results* in *slightly* more activity and distraction from eating
