by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 02:46 est , 10 july 2012 rebel : @entity2 , the mp for @entity3 , has vowed to join those voting against a policy for @entity6 , despite the fact it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide @entity10 is braced for a crushing defeat tonight on @entity13 reform			1
up to 70 @entity14 are expected to rebel against a policy that tops the wish - list of their @entity19 coalition partners			1
one of them , @entity2 told the @entity21 he will join them even though it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide			1
‘ when i asked the prime minister recently why on earth we were going to bring in this bill , he replied simply : “ it ’s the only thing @entity30 asked for in the @entity31 ” , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
@entity32 is expecting the government ’s first commons defeat , pitching the two parties of the @entity36 into turmoil			1
mr @entity30 was heckled by @entity38 last night as he attacked opponents of elected peers ‘ whatever the century ’			1
the @entity19 leader suggested the government might agree to fresh commons votes to approve further stages of reform after the first tranches of peers are elected in 2015			1
but as 70 @entity14 broke cover yesterday to say they would rebel , one senior @entity48 said it would be better for the legislation to suffer a heavy defeat than a narrow one			1
a big loss would put mr @entity10 under intense pressure to tell mr @entity30 the plan must be abandoned			1
the key vote this evening is on the timetable for the legislation , which the government wants to limit to ten days of debate			1
a defeat would mean months of open - ended parliamentary debate on the issue , snarling up other @entity60 business			1
@entity14 stalwart @entity66 , who has defied his party only once in three decades , said the bill was a ‘ constitutional catastrophe ’ that ‘ must be defeated at all costs ’			1
mr @entity2 , a ministerial aide to @entity72 secretary @entity71 , said the proposal to abolish the @entity13 and replace it with a mainly elected second chamber was an act of ‘ constitutional vandalism ’			1
split : @entity10 is braced for defeat over the @entity13 reform policy championed by @entity30 he claimed the prime minister ’s private remarks about the reason for pressing ahead with the legislation showed it was a ‘ @entity19 obsession ’			1
‘ but it is also a distraction for @entity87 from important debate and an irrelevance to the @entity91 people			1
i will be proud to vote against it , ’ he added			1
mr @entity2 wrote last night to mr @entity10 and the government ’s chief whip @entity93 informing them of his intentions and inviting them to sack him			1
number 10 said any member of the government voting against or abstaining in tonight ’s vote would lose their job			1
at least one other parliamentary private secretary is expected to quit , with half a dozen more harbouring serious doubts			2
under the government ’s plans , the @entity13 , which will soon have 1,000 appointed and hereditary members , will be transformed into a democratic chamber over 15 years			1
members will be elected in three tranches at the next three general elections , using a system of proportional representation designed to ensure no party wins an overall majority			2
' constitutional catastrophe ' : @entity14 stalwart @entity66 , who has defied his party only once in three decades , said the bill ' must be defeated at all costs ' by 2025 , there will be 450 members serving single 15 - year terms			1
eighty per cent will be elected and 20 per cent appointed by an independent commission			2
pro-reform ministers say it is high time to end the culture of cronyism which means parties appointing failed mps , ex-ministers and donors to an unelected second house			2
but mr @entity2 insisted the proposals would produce a second chamber of @entity87 ‘ with a new phalanx of politicians chosen from lists selected by the political parties and their ever - diminishing memberships ’			1
‘ the quality of the debate in the @entity13 is enriched by the presence of captains of industry , retired senior civil servants and military figures , people from the arts and voluntary sectors , diplomats and bishops , ’ he added			2
‘ many are figures who would never contemplate standing for political office on a party ticket			2
it seems obvious to me that @entity87 would be worse off if we swapped this for 400 party placemen			2
’ he warned there would be ‘ no stopping ’ an elected lords challenging the supremacy of the @entity165			2
‘ i have told the prime minister and the chief whip i can not support the @entity168			2
in all probability , this will mean that i have to give up my job			1
but it is too important to stop this act of constitutional vandalism to put career before principle			2
’ mr @entity30 insisted @entity91 was the only country in the world , other than @entity178 , that has a second parliamentary chamber that is appointed rather than elected			1
‘ there is neither accountability nor legitimacy in the status quo			2
surely it is time to trust the @entity91 people , ’ mr @entity30 told @entity38			2
conservative constitutional reform minister @entity186 urged fellow @entity14 to realise that @entity187 – which says it will vote against the government ’s timetable , but support the legislation later – was trying to damage the @entity36			1
but @entity191 of @entity192 , former speaker of the @entity165 , urged rebels to wreck the bill			1
‘ i have never witnessed such a reckless attempt to change the @entity91 constitution and to do it on such spurious grounds , ’ she said			2
every time @entity30 dealt with one bunch of enemy insurgents , another lot sprouted elsewhere			2
i say ‘ enemy ’ insurgents , but in fact they were on his own side of the chamber : @entity14 pinging curried devilment at this gulpy , scratchy - voiced deputy pm			1
coalition - on - @entity36 fire			2
here , @entity213 , catch this fizzing hand grenade			2
‘ i am very grateful to my @entity215 ... ka - boom ! ’ mr @entity30 opened the second reading debate of the @entity217 at 3.38pm			2
by 3.40 the first wave of @entity14 mujihadeen came screaming over the horizon : @entity221 ( @entity222 ) and @entity223 ( @entity224 & @entity225 )			0
mr @entity30 played the eeh - bah - gum card , trying to claim that not enough peers come from the north - east of @entity228			0
he also felt that peers were too old			0
that ’s a bit ageist , is n’t it ? reforms : the government plans would see appointed and hereditary peers transformed over 15 years into a democratic chamber a friend of mine once had lunch with @entity241 ’s @entity240 ( who kept gobbing with astonishing accuracy into a distant spittoon )			1
the shrivelled little fella said that in his view no man was ready for political life until he was at least 60			0
but what would mr @entity30 ( b.1967 ) know of that ? instantly , more @entity14 backbenchers were up , hollering and waving their shields			0
@entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , mistress main , @entity256			0
these warriors and others hopped and wailed			0
mr @entity253 ’s voice was so high , you wondered if he had submitted to the surgeon ’s snip			0
while mr @entity30 tried to provide answers , @entity263 ( con , @entity264 ) stared bleakly at the ceiling			0
on the @entity60 bench , only two @entity14 big hitters ( @entity268 and @entity269 ) were present			1
they did their best to look bland			0
mr @entity30 ’s @entity19 backbench troops had not all turned out to support him			0
only 25 were on parade			0
of these , not all of them were necessarily ardent fans			0
@entity276 ( @entity277 ) put in a rare appearance			0
he rotated his ankle and wore a dazzling smile			0
the @entity282 was just about managing to keep his chin above the waters , despite the hoo - hah ( @entity286 were asking sceptical questions , too )			0
@entity288 ( con , @entity289 ) attacked mr @entity30 ’s policy from directly behind his right shoulder			0
next to mr @entity288 sat @entity292 ( @entity293 ) , shaking her head in full camera view			0
@entity296 ( @entity297 ) was loving it			0
@entity19 minister @entity299 looked as though she might start to cry			0
mr @entity30 claimed that sir @entity300 supported lords reform			0
@entity300 ’s grandson @entity66 ( con , @entity303 ) rose to offer a more considered view			1
mr @entity66 was genuinely irked			1
he said @entity300 had altered his view as he matured			0
the subtext here , unless i am mistaken , was : you ’ll grow out of this fetish , @entity30			0
the @entity13 relished the @entity66 intervention			1
mr @entity30 tried to cite past @entity187 support for his policy , only for @entity313 ( lab , @entity314 ) , so gnarled a comrade that she may once have taken dictation from @entity318 , to correct him			0
now yet more @entity14 were on their feet : @entity320 , @entity2 , @entity321 , @entity322			0
for mr @entity30 it must have been like trying to drive a car packed with squabbling family members			0
why is he insisting on this @entity168 ? easy			0
@entity19 in future have little hope of making it to @entity87 unless the @entity13 is fixed on a @entity329 ( @entity297 , @entity330 ) suggested @entity331 would be full of failed politicians			0
mr @entity30 : ‘ no. they ’ll be a different kind of politician			0
’ the @entity13 hooted , @entity336 ( con , @entity337 ) clapping with delight			0
@entity339 ( @entity340 , @entity341 ) asked if mr @entity30 and his @entity19 would refuse appointment to an unreformed lords			0
for @entity187 , @entity347 made an incomprehensibly jerky , glottal - stoppy speech , one of the worst i have heard			0
not so sir @entity351 ( @entity297 , @entity352 ) who in six minutes of scintillating oratory attacked ‘ this puny measure ’ and its plans for ‘ a sham democratic chamber ’			1
they return to the debate today , but as we go into half - time young @entity213 has as much ground to recover as @entity360 circa 1940 .			0

ministerial aide says he will back plans even though it will cost him his job
stalwart @entity66 says bill ' must be defeated at all costs '
no 10 says any @entity60 member voting against will lose their job
government want to replace current chamber with democratic one
