by @entity0 it 's normally known as an anti-wrinkle jab – but for those crippled by stroke , @entity3 can be a lifeline , helping to restore lost movement			1
now , more @entity8 patients will benefit after medical watchdog the @entity10 licensed the muscle - freezing drug for treatment of limb problems			1
it follows a trial of 120 patients with post-stroke ankle difficulties which found that @entity3 injections enabled them to regain control and movement			1
@entity21 , 27 , from @entity22 , developed muscle spasms following a stroke but is having @entity3 jabs to aid her recovery ‘ this is one of the most important advances for years , ’ says professor @entity27 , of the @entity28			1
‘ by allowing the ankle to function more normally , this can bring important mobility and physical benefits to patients , even those who have been suffering from this condition for many years			2
’ stroke affects at least 150,000 @entity38 a year and there are more than a million stroke survivors in the @entity38			2
up to 30 per cent live with muscle stiffness , known as post-stroke spasticity			2
one person who already knows the benefits of @entity3 is @entity21 , 27 , who developed dystonia – a condition that causes muscles to spasm – following a stroke			1
@entity21 was affected throughout her left side , and her left hand was permanently clamped into a claw			1
it was so bad that she was unable even to hold a cup of tea			2
physiotherapy and the blood - thinning medication warfarin both failed to aid her recovery and she grew so self - conscious that she barely went out			2
it was only when @entity21 started receiving regular @entity3 jabs that her body bounced back			1
green light : @entity3 will be used by the @entity8 for treatment of limb problems after being licensed by a medical watchdog ‘ both the stroke and its aftermath were incredibly scary , ’ she says			1
‘ i could n’t eat or talk or even go to the toilet by myself			0
i had to start everything from scratch , like a baby			0
when the medication and physio did n’t work , i began to despair			0
but @entity3 has helped me lead a normal life again			1
’ stroke patients benefit because the botulinum toxin freezes stiff muscles to stop them spasming , and restores control of the limb			1
previous research suggested injections could help stroke victims regain movement in arms and hands			0
the new study shows it can help lower limbs too , allowing feet to function normally and straightening a stuck or ‘ drop ’ foot			0
@entity21 , from @entity22 , suffered her stroke in november 2008			1
‘ one day i tried to get up off the sofa and could n’t move , ’ she says			0
‘ i tried to speak and slurred my words			0
’ she was rushed to hospital , where an mri scan revealed a huge blood clot on the right side of her brain			0
‘ i had no power in my legs and had to be spoon - fed puree , ’ she says			0
’ three weeks of intensive physiotherapy in hospital taught her to take tentative steps on her own			0
but life was far from normal			0
‘ i ’d fall asleep from the exhaustion of walking , ’ she says			0
‘ there was no way i could go back to my stressful job running a wine bar			0
’ the following september she developed an irregular heartbeat and was prescribed warfarin			2
but neither that , nor weekly physio , made much improvement			0
in early 2010 , @entity21 began to despair when she developed dystonia – constant spasming of the muscles			1
‘ i lost control over my left arm , ’ she says			2
‘ the pain was intense			0
it travelled down my arm from my shoulder and stopped me sleeping			0
my arm was permanently clenched into my body and my left hand was like a claw			0
if i did manage to hold a glass , i would smash it as i had no control			2
’ in may 2010 she was prescribed @entity3 by her doctor , @entity133 , consultant physician in @entity134 for @entity135			1
he explains : ‘ it blocks the release of a chemical called acetylcholine from the nerve , which stops the muscle contracting			2
‘ it starts to work within four to seven days , reaches its peak function within six weeks , and should last at least four months			0
’ @entity21 was given eight 1mg jabs – four in her biceps and four in her forearm			1
she found the injections ‘ incredibly painful ’ but , unlike other drugs used for stroke , @entity3 does n’t have any known side effects on the liver or kidneys			1
dr @entity133 says @entity3 can actually improve muscle function			1
‘ it must be used in conjunction with physiotherapy to stop the muscles getting stiff , ’ he says			2
‘ it relaxes the muscle injected so it is easier to stretch it			0
@entity21 had a splint to keep her fingers stretched			1
‘ each treatment costs up to £ 1,000 , and hopefully @entity21 will eventually be able to lead a normal life without it , but it ’s difficult to say how many courses a patient will need			1
’ @entity21 still has @entity3 every six months and is now well enough to take a degree at @entity170			1
she says : ‘ it ’s made an incredible difference			0
my arm muscles stopped spasming and it was wonderful being able to uncurl my hand			1
best of all , the pain stopped , i ’ve got my confidence back			0
‘ there was a time i thought i ’d never lead a normal life but thanks to the @entity3 i ’m happy again			1
i do n’t want to build up a dependence but as long as it keeps being effective i ’ll carry on having it			0

@entity3 will be used by the @entity8 for treatment of limb problems
@entity21 , 27 , developed dystonia and recovered with jabs
@entity3 stops muscles from spasming , and restores control of the limb
