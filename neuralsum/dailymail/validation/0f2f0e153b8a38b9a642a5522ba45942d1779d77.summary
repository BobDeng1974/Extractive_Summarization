the makeshift presentation area at the @entity2 and the standby winners ’ press conference were all in vain			0
@entity5 recorded their second biggest @entity7 victory under @entity8 but - after bolting ahead in the three - horse race thanks to a @entity11 hat - trick - they watched the trophy painfully slip out of their one - handed grasp			1
it was a scintillating second - half display at the @entity15			1
@entity16 were chewed up and spat out , while @entity5 feasted like old emperors of @entity18			1
@entity8 ’s side will take face from the performance and , looking ahead to the @entity23 , the @entity19 rounded off the competition with no anxieties about september ’s pool of death			1
@entity28 celebrates after crossing over to score one of @entity5 ' second half tries during a stunning display at the @entity15 @entity5 wing @entity11 crosses over for @entity8 's side as he managed a sensational second half try hat - trick out in @entity18 @entity36 opened the try account for @entity5 early in the first - half as @entity39 ( centre ) and @entity41 ( right ) watch on @entity16 xv : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity41 , @entity55 replacements : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 tries : @entity46 , @entity43 conversions : @entity67 penalties : @entity69 , @entity63 @entity5 xv : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity36 , @entity28 , @entity73 , @entity74 ; @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 replacements : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity72 , @entity89 , @entity28			1
tries : @entity36 , @entity28 , @entity71 ( 3 ) , @entity74 , @entity81 , @entity91 conversions : @entity73 ( 6 ) penalties : @entity70 ( 2 ) , @entity73 ‘ we wo n’t be going into the @entity23 with any fears of not qualifying from our group , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ we will improve as we spend time together and there is no fear about playing @entity99 at @entity100 , or @entity101			0
we can go there with some real confidence and belief that we can get out of our group			0
‘ you have sides ranked fourth , fifth and sixth in the world , so that shows how tough it is to get out of that group			0
@entity107 with preparation will be tough as well and it ’s unfortunate that you are going to have one of the big teams not making the quarter - finals			2
that ’s what has happened but we are confident we can get out of that group and progress to the quarter - finals			0
’ @entity16 , meanwhile , will be easy meat at the @entity23 if they do not improve their flaky blue line of defence			2
they provided easy pickings in the second half , although that should not detract from @entity5 ' ambition and enterprise shown after the half - time break			1
it was a stark contrast to the opening 40 minutes , when the visitors ’ inexperienced front - row were shown up by the @entity16 pack			1
@entity16 had been slated , written off and identified as whipping boys , yet they came out growling in the national anthems and would have been in front at the break , had it not been for a @entity73 penalty on the stroke of @entity140 ’s whistle			2
‘ it does n’t matter who you ’re playing against , it ’s difficult to put a team away in the first half , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ we were under some pressure at the scrum and @entity16 slowed the game down			2
it was hard for us to get tempo , but i thought we were very , very good when we started playing a bit more positively			0
’ the experienced @entity51 , back in the @entity157 front - row after being bitten on the nose by a dog , caused problems at the set - piece and carried hard in the early exchanges			0
all the talk in the @entity163 bars had been about not whether @entity5 would win in @entity18 , but how many points they could put on their second - rate opponents			1
there was an instant @entity157 retort and – after @entity5 were penalised for using blockers to help @entity78 at the kick - off – @entity47 kicked the hosts to an unexpected lead			1
@entity5 had to steady the ship and so they did , with a penalty through the ever - reliable @entity70			2
@entity5 full - back @entity70 receives treatement after a nasty collision forced him off the field of play at the @entity15 @entity51 ( centre ) rides the challenge of @entity78 ( left ) as @entity16 hosted @entity5 in the @entity7 final day parity ; a chance for @entity5 to start again , although that was not the case			1
@entity16 were supposed to be short on spirit after the withdrawal of skipper @entity187 , although their was no lack of belief during the early blows			2
@entity47 left the pitch with a broken wrist but @entity63 took over the kicking and edged his side back in front with a 10th minute penalty			0
there was little on show that would give @entity199 or @entity99 much to fear			0
@entity36 and @entity46 exchanged scores and @entity5 went into the break with an unconvincing one - point lead			1
they had lost @entity70 to concussion and their title ambitions were looking bleak			0
but then , out of nowhere , the flick switched and the lights started flashing red			0
@entity16 capitulated and @entity5 turned up the heat			1
they upped the tempo and – with @entity81 and @entity79 working tirelessly up front – the backline started to fire			0
@entity74 turned down a kick at goal for a tap penalty , finding @entity216 on a cute inside line to open the floodgates			0
the banks of the @entity220 were imploding and @entity45 was sent to the sin - bin			0
within 10 second - half minutes , @entity71 had completed his hat - trick , drawing on his pace to finish two out wide and his power to finish a third through the middle			1
it was the sort of rugby that viewers have been craving throughout this year ’s competition			0
it lacked of edge - of - seat intensity of the defensive phases against @entity199 , but would give the @entity234 nations a run for easy - on - the - eye viewing			0
@entity52 followed @entity45 to the sin - bin and , powering over from the back of a maul , @entity74 edged the scoreline towards 50 points			2
@entity242 reaches out to add another try as @entity5 put in a sensational second half performance to crush @entity16 in @entity18 on saturday @entity5 wing @entity11 stampedes through a challenge from @entity247 to score a third try in the second half @entity5 unleashed their loaded bench , with @entity72 , @entity88 and @entity89 all making a late impact ; after @entity242 had been introduced early as a replacement for @entity70			1
finishing off a break from just outside the @entity254 22 , @entity81 darted under the posts to move his side past the half - century mark , before @entity242 finished off another fine move to leave the organisers questioning their decision to send the trophies to @entity100 and @entity262			1
@entity5 had done what they came to do			2
they had achieved the mammoth scoreline and the celebratory drinks were on ice			0
they pushed for one last try but , out of nowhere , @entity43 crashed the party			0
the @entity157 winger broken downfield for a late try , with the score confirmed by the @entity272			0
@entity273 was probably a 14 - point swing in terms of the points difference , ’ said @entity8			1
with @entity5 missing out on the title by a handful of points , it proved to be a costly mistake			2
the lucky @entity5 fans who made the trip to the @entity15 were treated to a masterclass of rugby in the second half in @entity18 @entity36 launches himself at @entity63 ( left ) as the @entity5 side cruised to a comprehensive win in the @entity7 @entity5 ' @entity81 scores a try during the @entity7 demolition of @entity16 in the 61 - 20 victory at the @entity15 on saturday @entity81 yells in delight having scored a second - half try for @entity5 as @entity8 's side ran riot with 47 unanswered points the victorious @entity5 players applaud the travelling fans in @entity5 after @entity8 's men kept their @entity7 title dreams alive the @entity5 squad congratulate each other having put in a sensational display to thrash @entity16 61 - 20 in the @entity7			1

@entity8 's side took a slender **13** - 14 first half lead out in @entity18
@entity247 went over for @entity16 's try after @entity36 had scored @entity5 ' opener
within the first fifteen minutes of the second - half @entity5 scored three quick - fire tries to go **13** - *35* up
the @entity254 *domination* *continued* as @entity16 went down to 14 men twice , and @entity5 scored 47 unanswered points
