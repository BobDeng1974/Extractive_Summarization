miss @entity12 , who has lived in a penthouse flat with her 25 - year - old son directly above @entity32 for 15 years , told the court : ' i was carrying a bin bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other			1
' the lights had n't worked since november the year before so i was being careful			2
i felt something sharp on my shin and that was the last thing i remember			0
' i fell down two flights of stairs			0
i was lying at the bottom crying because i 'd hurt my wrist really badly			0
i have a fused wrist and it bent backwards			0
it ca n't do that and i still remember the pain			2
' i could taste blood			0
it was on my face and in my hair			2

i shone the light at the top of the stairs and then i saw the wire			1
' her door was closed on the wire to keep it in place			0

following a two - day trial at @entity149 , a jury dismissed @entity32 's claims that she had no reason to set a tripwire			0
they took just three hours and 25 minutes to find her guilty of causing actual bodily harm			0

you showed no remorse then and you show no remorse now			0
