by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 12 june 2013 first , there was the cake made to look like an astonishingly realistic raw turkey			1
now food artist , @entity4 , has turned her attention to creating sweet treats that look like scarily lifelike bugs			2
the sweets , which were inspired by @entity10 's passion for natural history , includes a leech , a garden snail , a warty toad , a newt , fossils and an endangered beetle - all of which are made from chocolate			1
the bizarre sweets , which will go on sale at @entity22 from september , will appeal to children with a penchant for creepie crawlies as well as natural history lovers , say @entity10 and her business partner , @entity27			1
realistic : this snail ( and its cabbage leaf ) might look lifelike but they 're actually made from chocolate gruesome : @entity4 and @entity27 ' chocolate worm and confectionery creepie crawlie look scarily lifelike @entity4 said : ' we are following our passions and this has led to us wanting to create a fun , family friendly business			1
' we are artists with a love of natural history and a background in luxury confections			1
so obviously we had to make @entity44 happen ! ' although the pair are self - taught chocolatiers , they say their background in cake making , sculpting and crafting backgrounds gave them all the skills they needed , along with a mutual love of the natural world			2
' we can hopefully all remember what it was like to be a child , discovering something for the first time , ' added @entity27 , â€˜ the wonder and excitement of being confronted by something amazing - something strangely beautiful like a frog or a dragonfly or a dinosaur			0
' @entity69 dinner : @entity4 's amazingly realistic ' raw turkey ' was actually an orange drizzle cake tasty : once the ' turkey ' was sliced into , its sweet secret was revealed - much to the @entity10 family 's relief in december last year @entity4 made a turkey cake so realistic it was almost impossible to distinguish it from a real raw turkey			1
the baker spent three days working on her realistic cake , which was served on a foil tray and even featured a piece of string holding the turkey ' legs ' together			0
' i just made it as a one - off to freak out my family , ' said @entity4 , who worked in secret at night to ensure her creation was a complete surprise on christmas day			2
' the most unappealing thing i could think of to give them was raw meat			0
they 're used to me doing beautiful things like wedding cakes , so this was something different			0
' nobody actually believed it was a cake until we sliced into it			0
when we did everyone stood up and i realised they were all crowding around to take pictures			0
' although @entity10 said she hopes to create more ' turkeys ' , for now she and @entity110 are working on an installation called ' @entity112 ' , which will form part of the @entity114 in @entity115 this month .			0

the chocolate insects are the creation of @entity4 and @entity27
@entity10 hit the *headlines* when she made a cake that looked like a raw turkey
the new *venture* is inspired by natural history and will be sold in @entity22
