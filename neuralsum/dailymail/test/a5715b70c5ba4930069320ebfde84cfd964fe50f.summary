with temperatures creeping up , let ’s celebrate with some ice cream			1
in fact , why not make your own ? the choice of ice cream makers has never been wider			1
@entity8 tried out the best brands on the @entity10 with some enthusiastic help from her children @entity13 , 13 , and @entity14 , eight			0
the @entity16 & @entity17 maker is best for dinner parties best for dinner parties @entity16 & @entity17 maker , £ 49.99 , argos.co.uk how does it work ? this minimalist , cube - shaped machine looks sleek and impressive			2
the removable bowl — which has an inner , freezable gel layer — has to be frozen for eight hours before you put it back in the machine , then add the mixing arm , pop on the lid , and turn it on			2
as it starts to churn , you slowly pour in the mixture according to the recipe included — a basic one of egg yolks , cornflour , sugar , double cream and vanilla extract which has to be cooked and cooled in the fridge			2
check the progress every five minutes or so , switching it off when it ’s reached the texture you want			0
is it any good ? at two litres , this has one of the biggest capacities we came across , so it ’s perfect for dinner parties and family gatherings			0
unusually , the bowl rotates on this machine , while the mixing arm stays still — which looks clever , but creates a huge amount of noise			2
@entity13 and @entity14 kept popping in to ask if it was ready — not because they were looking forward to eating it , but because they wanted the racket to stop ! fortunately the clattering was over in 20 minutes and the light , fluffy ice cream was really tasty			1
verdict : nice ice cream , shame about the noise			1
having to keep a close eye on the machine until the ice cream is the right texture is a pain , too			1
rating : best for kudos in the kitchen @entity71 by @entity72 , £ 349.99 , sageappliances.co.uk how does it work ? sleek and polished , this looks like a breadmaker but weighs in at a huge 12.5 kilos ( 26lbs )			1
unlike other machines , it ’s self - refrigerating ( so there ’s no need to freeze the mixer bowl before use )			0
the leaflet recommends using a chocolate creme @entity85 ( custard , to us regular folk ) made from cream , milk , egg yolks , dark chocolate and sugar , which is cooled and poured into the bowl which sits within the machine			2
then you pick from the 12 consistencies the machine can make ( including sorbet , frozen yogurt , gelato and ice cream ) , turn it on and let the rotating paddle whip it together			1
thirty minutes later , a litre of your favourite ice creamis ready			0
is it any good ? beautifully smooth and truly delicious			0
we all licked our bowls clean			0
best of all , the machine signalled that it was ready by playing a retro ice cream van jingle , which the kids adored			1
verdict : a fantastic ice cream maker , but bulky and expensive			1
rating : the @entity71 by @entity72 is a fantastic ice cream maker , but bulky and expensive @entity116 shake n @entity117 , £ 14.99 , thefowndry.com how does it work ? this looks more like a large plastic takeaway cup			1
half - fill it with crushed ice and four tbsp of salt , then place your ice cream mix , a 50/50 blend of milk , single cream , flavouring and sugar , in the metal cone - shaped container which sits inside , screw it together and shake vigorously for three minutes			1
a neat , individual portion of ice cream should be waiting inside			1
is it any good ? a doddle for the children to use , and educational too — they loved learning how salt helps make the frozen dessert ( it allows the very cold , melting ice to cover a greater area of the metal cone , if you ’re interested )			0
so we were disappointed to find little more than a frothy milkshake , despite three minutes of serious shaking from @entity14			0
@entity13 took over for two minutes , but the resulting thin , rock hard layer of vanilla ice cream had to be chiselled off the sides			1
a second attempt , with a four - minute shake , gave a more palatable result			0
verdict : a fun gadget , but for all that effort , it ’s a bit leaky and you only get a small portion			0
rating : @entity159 's best for budgets is the @entity160 ( left ) but for kids the giant plastic ' ice cream cone ' ( right ) from @entity163 is perfect best for children @entity167 , £ 12.99 , @entity168 how does it work ? this giant plastic ‘ ice cream cone ’ had the kids salivating before we ’d even started			1
you simply freeze the soft , rubbery cornet section , which is lined with thick freezable gel , for four to six hours , then use the lid to measure out the ingredients recommended in the leaflet — in our case , just single cream , strawberry sauce and a little sugar			0
then you tip the ingredients into the frozen cornet , screw the container back together and give everything a shake			0
finally , you remove the top section of the lid and squeeze the cornet repeatedly for 30 seconds to encourage the ice cream to freeze and churn , before diving in — you can eat directly from the container with the long - handled spoon supplied , saving on washing up ! is it any good ? it ’s surprisingly well - made , considering the price , and really easy to use			1
we were all amazed at how quickly it transformed the contents into a sweet but slightly lumpy soft - serve ice cream			1
verdict : a cute , well - made gadget that children will love			0
rating : cute , pink and compact , this machine is designed to produce a smaller , 500ml portion of ice cream ( that ’s the same size as a tub of @entity208 ’s or @entity209 ) best for perfect portions @entity212 , £ 19.99 , lakeland.co.uk how does it work ? @entity14 fell in love with this as soon as she saw it			1
cute , pink and compact , it ’s designed to produce a smaller , 500ml portion of ice cream ( that ’s the same size as a tub of @entity208 ’s or @entity209 )			1
the removable bowl - shaped base also fits neatly in to my packed freezer			0
once it ’s thoroughly frozen ( which takes about eight hours ) you slot the lid , motor and paddle together and fix them on top of the base			0
then you flick the on / off switch and slowly pour in your ice cream mix , in our case a cooked custard recommended in the handbook , made from whole milk , double cream , egg yolk , sugar and vanilla paste			1
your ice cream should be ready in 15 - 20 minutes			1
is it any good ? as you ’d expect from @entity247 , this is a high - quality , no - fuss product that delivers — neatly and without too much noise			0
the only downside ? you need to keep an eye on it to get the texture of the ice cream just right			1
verdict : a basic but handy little ‘ everyday ’ gadget			0
rating : best for retro fans @entity259 3 in 1 slush and @entity261 , £ 59.99 , @entity262 how does it work ? at first glance , this @entity265 - inspired machine looks more like a blender ( or ‘ a bubblegum dispenser ’ according to my children )			2
in fact , it makes and dispenses both soft - serve ice cream and slushy drinks , and has a tall aluminium ice cylinder inside the plastic vessel			1
first , you fill the aluminium cylinder with salt , ice and water , then put on the lid and set it to start mixing			0
as the paddles rotate , you pour your ice cream mixture — mine was a blend of condensed milk , double cream , whole milk , sugar , vanilla extract and mashed fresh strawberries — into the plastic casing , and watch as the combination of the icy central cylinder and stirring starts to create ice cream			2
at first glance , this @entity265 - inspired machine looks more like a blender ( or ‘ a bubblegum dispenser ’ according to my children ) once the ice cream looks ready , which takes approximately 12 minutes , turn the machine to ‘ dispense ’ mode for a stream of velvety soft ice cream			1
is it any good ? @entity308 to use , but quite noisy			0
we also had to remember to top up the ice as it melted before the ice cream had formed			2
but the kids loved dispensing the result , which comes out ‘ mr @entity315 ’ style			0
and they declared it ‘ delicious ’ , although it melted too quickly for my liking			0
verdict : a statement gadget — but it ’s noisy , and you need to be quick before the ice cream melts			2
rating : best for a quick treat @entity325 , £ 19.99 , domu.co.uk how does it work ? a brightly coloured , plastic and metal bowl that allows you to make a portion of ice cream by hand			1
freeze the metal bowl section that sits within the plastic casing for 12 hours in your freezer , return it to the plastic case and pour in your ice cream recipe			2
we used the recommended chocolate recipe , made with a little whole milk , cream , sugar , cocoa powder and a pinch of salt			0
stir the ingredients and scrape the sides of the bowl continuously with the spatula - style spoon supplied and the frozen bowl will produce a delicious ice cream in under ten minutes			1
is it any good ? @entity13 loved the idea of this , and he thought the bowl looked ‘ cool ’ once assembled ( praise indeed from a 13 - year - old )			0
yet after five minutes of stirring , he started to lose heart , as did i when the mixture splashed messily over the sides			0
after a bit more scraping and stirring , a solid white film of ice cream started to form on the steel bowl , and five minutes later , he had a generous portion of lovely , soft ice cream , into which he sprinkled a little grated chocolate			2
simply delicious ! verdict : a fun , but slightly messy way to make and personalise your own ice creams			0
