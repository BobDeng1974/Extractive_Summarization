but this was easily eclipsed by @entity32 in the southern @entity34 city of @entity35 – which retained its position as the planet ’s busiest air hub			1
a crucial connection airport for travellers within the @entity34 – or for visitors from @entity42 continuing further west into the @entity34 , or on into @entity43 – @entity32 played host to 94 million passengers in 2013			2

this was by far the biggest increase on growth in traffic on 2012 among the top ten busiest airports – a surge of 15 per cent			1
@entity76 ’s expansion in significance is set to continue to in the next few years			2

‘ aviation ’s nucleus appears to be moving eastward			0
‘ other emerging markets such as @entity120 , @entity79 and @entity121 that have a critical mass of traffic remain major contributors to the upward surge in air transport demand			2
