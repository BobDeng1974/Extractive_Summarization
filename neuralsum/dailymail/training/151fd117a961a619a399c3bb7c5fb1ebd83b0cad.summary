a deaf couple have become the first people in @entity2 to record their baby 's name in sign language on her birth certificate			1
theatre director @entity7 , 47 , and her partner @entity8 , 39 , from @entity9 , north @entity10 , wanted to record @entity12 's name in @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , but said they were initially told by their local @entity15 that it was impossible			1
now their personal name for four - year - old @entity12 , a reference to her smiling face , has pride of place on her birth certificate - as @entity23			1
instead it is a made - up combination of symbols which , when taken in context , describes her personality in a way only her parents and friends can fully understand			1
@entity12 's sign name is written as @entity23 , which represents a combination of hand movements			1
the @entity57 represents the chin , @entity56 means a ' baby o ' made with the thumb and forefinger , @entity55 means ' hands facing the signer ' , @entity61 means ' the handshape opens ' and @entity65 shows the shape of the hand			1
put that together and it makes a small o shape held at the chin , which then opens into an l shape			2
ms @entity7 told @entity72 she had a battle of up to nine months with the @entity15			2
the issue was finally sorted around four years ago , but the case has had little publicity			0
' my daughter 's sign name is what it is because her first expression was a smile , ' she said			1
' there 's no way to translate it perfectly into @entity86			0
' but we went to the register office and they said it was " ridiculous , you ca n't register a sign name , do n't be silly "			0
so we got in touch with a solicitor , who said the law allows people to have their name on a birth certificate " in their own language "			0
' the couple officially named their daughter @entity12			2
but her sign name is formed by a change from a closed to open index and thumb handshape near the chin the couple consulted with a linguist how to officiate on paper their daughter 's sign name , and with the help of a lawyer have now managed to record their daughter 's @entity13 name @entity23 @entity57 represents the chin @entity56 means a ' baby o ' made with the thumb and forefinger @entity55 means ' hands facing the signer ' @entity61 means ' the handshape opens ' @entity65 shows the shape of the hand at the end put together , that makes a small o shape with the thumb and forefinger held at the chin , which then opens out into an l shape			1
a spokesman for the @entity135 said : ' when you come up with a sign name it 's often as a result of a characteristic			2
judging by the type of symbols in this name , the parents might have noticed @entity12 smiles or laughs a lot			2
' with other people , if they talk a lot for example their sign name might include wiggling fingers at their mouth			0
' but there 's no exact translation			0
@entity12 's is n't a specific name or spelt out			1
it all depends on the context of the relationship with the child			0
' by an unusual coincidence , both of the couple 's children are deaf - but they say they could n't be happier			2
ms @entity7 said : ' we 're the best possible parents for them '			0
mr @entity165 said he had tried to register his first daughter @entity166 's name in @entity13 but was told it was not possible			0
when his second daughter came along , he told bslzone he was more determined			0
he said : ' why did ( the name ) have to be registered in @entity86 ? @entity2 @entity13 ( @entity13 ) has been recognised , why could we not have it in @entity13 ? ' they consulted with a linguist how to officiate on paper their daughter 's sign name , and with the help of a lawyer have now managed to record their daughter 's @entity13 name			1
happy : @entity12 is completely unaware of her significance as she crawls around her parents ' @entity10 home the little girl 's name is written in sign notation as @entity23			1
it is formed by a change from a closed to open index and thumb handshape near the chin @entity8 , who changed his name from @entity195 aged 20 because it was a more ' visual , strong name ' , was the one who came up with the idea			2
ms @entity7 said that she had originally dismissed her partner 's desire to register @entity12 's name in @entity13			1
but she said : ' looking back i realised @entity201 was right			0
' we 've been so used to having our language dismissed and we 've accepted that			0
the law is there , and we have rights			0
' sign language is stronger than we thought			1
