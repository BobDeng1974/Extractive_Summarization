@entity1 head coach @entity0 , who should surely be sacked after the @entity3 humiliation against @entity4 , is doubly fortunate at the timing of this rock - bottom moment for @entity8 cricket			1
firstly , the new regime at the @entity10 are concentrating on a big restructuring of the organisation , to the extent that axing the beleaguered @entity0 was said not to be even on the agenda — or was n’t last week			1
secondly , @entity16 @entity15 , who would be hot favourite to replace @entity0 , is not sure he wants the role			1
@entity15 has five children — with four under the age of 10 — and the county championship - winning @entity22 coach has promised wife @entity24 he will put the family first			2
@entity1 coach @entity0 ( left ) said he is ' desperate ' to continue after his side 's poor @entity3 campaign @entity15 said : ‘ my eldest daughter @entity28 lives at home in @entity16 with her mum and i did n’t see her grow up as i was on the road playing for @entity16			1
i made a promise to myself that i would n’t do the same again			2
the children are my priority , family come first			2
’ and @entity15 , who worked very successfully with @entity1 number two @entity37 at a @entity22 bankrolled by new @entity10 chairman @entity38 , added : ‘ it would be a really big ask to go away 9 - 10 months a year			1
i would find that really difficult			0
i ’d find that a challenge			0
’ @entity42 ( left , with @entity44 manager @entity43 ) will work on his @entity45 this week @entity42 and @entity47 manager @entity46 are part of a select group of 24 coaches working on their @entity51 at @entity52 this week - at a time when the @entity45 of @entity54 are promoting their ‘ world class ’ alternative course which has @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 signed up			0
however , the @entity45 still regard their coaching badges as the gold standard and will react to the @entity54 competition by putting on two pro-licence courses a year in future rather than one			0
but there will be no reduction in the extra hours involved in completing the @entity68 course — 500 as compared to 350 in @entity54 — that the @entity45 believe gives their set - up the edge			0
@entity73 winning jockey @entity72 ’s ghastly n - word comment on a racing preview panel on the eve of last year ’s @entity76 seems to have been airbrushed out of insular racing ’s memory one year on			0
not only was @entity72 , who was fined and interviewed under police caution , included in exactly the same line - up for the annual tipping evening at famous racing pub the @entity83 on monday night , but the sport ’s promotional arm @entity86 have assistant trainer @entity72 featured riding @entity88 horse the new one on one of their main @entity91 preview videos on their official website			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity72 has paid his dues			0
’ @entity96 ( centre ) wears @entity99 sponsored kit whilst the rest of the @entity102 team wear @entity103 @entity96 looks anything but a team player — which he clearly is — in pictures on monday of the @entity102 @entity108 group celebrating their win against the @entity110			1
the players and management are in @entity103 - supplied official training kit , apart from @entity96 who is wearing his @entity99 shirt			1
it transpires that there was nothing in @entity99 ’s £ 3.5m - year - deal with @entity96 to prevent him slipping on a @entity120 tracksuit to demonstrate the side ’s unity for the cameras			1
but the @entity126 , in their wisdom , did n’t feel any need to have @entity96 , who had come straight off court , pictured in team uniform			1
former @entity132 champion @entity131 ’s ambassador appearance at the recent @entity134 racing festival in @entity135 has only added to speculation that the @entity137 — crassly described during @entity132 as ‘ not a looker ’ by @entity139 — is considering a return to the sport , but as a @entity134 citizen			0
and @entity131 would receive a huge sum for changing nationalities , reportedly as much as £ 1million			0
sir @entity145 ( right , with @entity146 ) took time off from presenting to play in a celebrity golf tournament surely sir @entity145 is not able to pick and choose when he works on @entity149 ’s @entity3 cricket coverage ? with a big celebrity golf pro-am date booked at the @entity151 in @entity152 this week , @entity145 was missing from the commentary box for @entity1 ’s do - or - die match against @entity4 in @entity155 on monday			1
however , it would not seem to be sir @entity145 ’s doing			2
a @entity149 spokesman said that host broadcasters @entity160 are responsible for the commentary roster .			2

@entity163 : @entity0 should be sacked after @entity3 *debacle*
@entity96 chose to wear his *personal* kit for @entity108 team photo
@entity145 missed *crucial* @entity1 match commentary for celebrity golf date
