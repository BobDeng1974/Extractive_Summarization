by @entity0 claims that almost one million people have had to resort to emergency supplies from food banks in the past year were dismissed as ‘ misleading and emotionally manipulative ’ yesterday			1
the row came after the @entity6 , a charity that runs more than 400 of @entity8 ’s food banks , said rising numbers were turning to the charity because their incomes have been ‘ squeezed ’			2
it claimed more than 913,000 people received three days ’ emergency food in the past year – almost a threefold rise on the previous 12 months – with over half blaming changes or delays to their benefit payments			0
the @entity6 who runs more than 400 food banks was accused of ' misleading the public ' on the issue of food poverty a letter signed by 36 @entity26 bishops and more than 600 church leaders from all major dominations also called for urgent action from ministers to tackle food poverty			2
but senior figures in the government yesterday accused the trust of ‘ publicity seeking ’ to benefit its own ‘ business ’ , pointing out that the growing number of food banks inevitably leads to people seeking out free food if it is available			1
the @entity41 added that a recent report by the @entity43 actually found that food poverty has gone down under this government			1
the proportion of those in the @entity8 who said they are finding it difficult to afford food dropped from 9.8 per cent in 2007 to 8.1 per cent in 2012			0
one senior @entity51 source described the food bank issue as ' fairly misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity seeking ' but the @entity6 ’s chairman , @entity54 , said : ‘ in the last year we ’ve seen things get worse , rather than better , for many people on low incomes			1
it ’s been extremely tough for a lot of people , with parents not eating properly in order to feed their children and more people than ever experiencing seemingly unfair and harsh benefits sanctions			0
’ in a highly political intervention , he also called for the government to drop sanctions against benefit claimants and increase the minimum wage			0
but a senior @entity51 source accused mr @entity54 of ‘ fairly misleading and emotionally manipulative publicity seeking ’			1
the source added : ‘ it ’s not entirely surprising given @entity54 is effectively running a business			2
’ another official said : ‘ the @entity6 have a stated aim to have a food bank in every town in the country , suggesting that they view food banks as a positive feature of a “ big society ”			2
‘ it ’s slightly confusing to hear them condemning increased use at the same time as aggressively marketing their services			0
’ the @entity41 said fewer people were struggling with their food bills according to a recent @entity43 report @entity95 mp @entity94 , a member of the work and pensions select committee , criticised the @entity6 ’s views on benefits			1
‘ for those in genuine need , the benefits system gives people a decent level of help , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think any of my constituents are clamouring for us to increase benefits			0
‘ there are nothing like a million people in this country who ca n’t afford to put a meal on the table			0
’ a @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ even the @entity43 says there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago , benefit processing times are improving and the @entity6 ’s own research recognises the effect their marketing activity has on the growth of their business			1
