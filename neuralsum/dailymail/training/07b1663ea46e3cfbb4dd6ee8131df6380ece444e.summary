the @entity1 secretary of health says there are likely ' more cases ' of @entity4 on @entity1 soil and that airport screening from departure countries is essential in preventing the spread			1
' we had one case and i think there may be other cases , and i think we have to recognize that as a nation , ' @entity9 said at a media breakfast today			2
@entity9 focused on airport screening and said although it was not 100 percent effective she had confidence in the precaution			0
' and that 's been in place for many months and as we know , we have a case			0
that case sadly is deceased			0
but for many months , we did not have a case that entered the country			0
' and we know that that screening has worked in the sense of 80 people have been pulled from the lines in the screening and stopped in the home country			0
and that 's the most important place to do that			2
' dead : @entity62 of @entity63 is the first man to be diagnosed with @entity64 and died on wednesday in @entity65 , @entity66 where he was being treated for the deadly virus the first patient diagnosed with the virus was @entity63 man @entity62 , 42 , who died on wednesday			0
since @entity62 's tragic diagnosis , airports in @entity33 have heightened their screening protocols to make sure no one with the virus leaves the country			1
according to the director of the @entity31 , dr. @entity73 , stopping travel to and from @entity33 all together will prevent containment of the disease within @entity33 and will then spread to the @entity1 and parts of @entity37			1
about 8,000 healthcare workers have been communicating through an alert network and have been on @entity31 webinars			0
@entity37 will almost inevitably see more cases of the deadly ebola virus within its borders but the continent is well prepared to control the disease , the @entity83 's regional director said on tuesday			1
departure screenings : screenings at @entity1 airports in departure countries like @entity33 are essential to containment and identification of the deadly virus speaking to @entity100 just hours after @entity37 's first local case of @entity4 infection was confirmed in a nurse in @entity99 , the @entity83 's @entity37 director , @entity95 , said further such events were ' unavoidable			1
' @entity99 health officials said four people had been hospitalized to try and stem any further spread of @entity4 there after the nurse became the first person in the world known to have contracted the virus outside of @entity33			1
' such imported cases and similar events as have happened @entity111 will happen also in the future , most likely , ' @entity95 told @entity100 in a telephone interview from her @entity115 office			0
spreading : @entity4 has infected some 7,200 people in @entity33 , killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history ' it is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from @entity37 to the affected countries and the other way around			1
' several countries in the @entity83 's @entity37 region , including @entity128 , @entity129 , the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity99 , have treated patients repatriated after contracting the disease in @entity33 , where @entity4 has been raging through @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity63 since march			1
@entity4 has infected some 7,200 people in @entity33 , killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history			2
cases have also been imported into @entity141 , @entity142 and the @entity1			0
@entity95 said that within @entity37 , health workers caring for repatriated @entity4 patients , as well as their families and close contacts , were most at risk of becoming infected			2
' but the most important thing ... is that @entity37 is still at low risk and that the western part of the @entity37 region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral hemorrhagic fevers including @entity4			2

despite efforts in the @entity1 to stop the spread of the deadly ebola virus , there may be more cases on @entity1 soil than already realized
travelers leaving @entity33 may have already brought the virus into the country , says secretary of health and human *services* @entity9
' the most important place with regard to taking care of screening is actually at the point of departure , ' she said
the director of the @entity83 said that cases of @entity4 in parts of @entity37 are ' unavoidable '
