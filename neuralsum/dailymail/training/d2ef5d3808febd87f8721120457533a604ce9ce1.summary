by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 08:17 est , 23 january 2013 @entity1 will release the pro version of its surface tablet on february 9 with a price tag of £ 630 - making it the most expensive tablet computer in the world			1
the @entity8 launch marks a new phase in @entity1 's global battle against arch - rival @entity11 , which sells its top of the range @entity14 £ 108 cheaper			1
the new @entity16 is powered by an @entity18 chip and can use the full version of windows 8 - meaning programs such as @entity21 can be used			1
the updated tablet is set to hit @entity24 and @entity25 shops on february 9 , with a starting price of @entity24 $ 899 ( £ 568 ) for a @entity28 version , and $ 999 ( £ 630 ) for the @entity30 version			1
this compares to $ 829 for @entity11 's top @entity32 - it does not make an equivalent with @entity30			0
beefed up : @entity1 's new @entity35 , which comes with a laptop - style @entity18 processor , runs the full version of @entity38 and can use fully featured @entity40 software like @entity21 and @entity41 however , it still lacks mobile network connectivity , meaning that users will have to be within range of a @entity46 network to access the internet on the device			1
the @entity35 will come packaged with the @entity49 , which allows users to write or draw on the device , but will not include the @entity51 , which will set users back a further $ 129 ( £ 82 )			1
prices for @entity54 , which would include vat , have not been released			0
add the extra keyboard and , since it is able to run @entity40 software like @entity21 , @entity41 and even resource - hungry video games , the @entity57 i5 - powered tablet could easily be a fully featured laptop replacement			1
its arm chip - powered little brother runs @entity65 , a slimmed down version of the operating system , and only works with apps bought on the @entity40 store and a modified version of @entity41 that @entity1 includes with the device			1
the pro version of @entity35 does not come with @entity41 installed			2
' @entity16 provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package , ' @entity1 said in a release			2
' perfect as your one device — at home , in the office , or on the road — it can run @entity38 applications , as well as current @entity84 desktop applications			0
' laptop replacement : @entity1 say the @entity35 offers the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet - shaped package - although the keyboard is not included as standard @entity92 , general manager of @entity1 's @entity93 , added in a blog post : ' whether you ’re a road warrior , a student or someone who just wants a flexible and powerful @entity99 , the @entity16 will deliver			2
' it ’s the perfect complement to the @entity101 and delivers hours and hours of entertainment with plenty of power and productivity to get your work done as well			0
' at its launch , two versions of the @entity35 will be available			0
the $ 899 version will come with @entity28 of solid - state storage , while a @entity30 version will set buyers back a rather steep $ 999			1
@entity116 interface : the @entity35 comes packaged with the @entity49 , which allows users to write or draw on the device			0
combined with @entity40 software like @entity21 it has exciting potential as well as the x86 - type @entity18 processor , the @entity35 comes equipped with @entity122 of @entity123 and a sparkling 1920x1080 high - definition display , compared to the @entity35 's 1366x768 screen resolution			0
the screen also supports 10 - point multi-touch , double what its little brother can offer			0
however , because of the power demands of i5 chip it also has a shorter battery life , managing closer to five hours against the ten hours more typical for rival tablets			0
it 's also a little bit heavier than the earlier version , at 2lbs rather than 1.5lbs			0
in the same release yesterday , @entity1 announced it will make available three new limited edition @entity139 , in red , magenta and cyan , and a @entity144 of its stylish @entity145			2
the company also announced that it will double the reach of the @entity35 by selling it in 13 additional markets worldwide			0
the tablet is currently available in @entity151 , @entity25 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , the @entity54 and the @entity24 , but will soon also be sold in @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , the @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168			1
limited edition : @entity1 's three new @entity170 , which are available in red , magenta and cyan stylish : also announced was the @entity144 of @entity1 's funky - looking @entity145 @entity1 has n't released sales figures for the earlier version of @entity35 , but mr @entity92 said in a release : ' the response to @entity35 has been exciting to see			1
' we ’re thrilled to continue growing the @entity35 family with the availability of @entity40 and by increasing the number of places customers can experience surface first hand			0
' availability and pricing of the @entity16 outside @entity8 have yet to be announced but @entity1 says it will go on sale in other markets ' in the coming weeks ' , @entity188 reports .			2
