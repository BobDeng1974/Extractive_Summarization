billing issues are the main problem , accounting for 84 per cent of the complaints made between january and june , according to the @entity25			1
many relate to late or inaccurate bills , as energy firms increasingly rely on estimates instead of door - to - door meter readings			2
estimates that are too low can land families with surprise invoices later on , while setting direct debit payments too high leaves energy firms sitting on millions of pounds of their customers ’ money			0
difficulty changing supplier was the second biggest issue , accounting for 13 per cent of complaints			0
the figures emerge just weeks after energy watchdog @entity43 warned @entity45 to resolve its billing problems by the end of august or face halting all telephone sales to new customers			1

some @entity45 customers have discovered they have paid too little for months – unwittingly building up large debts despite making regular payments , while others claim their bills or direct debits have jumped up unexpectedly			2
others complained they were made to wait for more than an hour on the phone to speak to a customer service adviser , who was then rude and unhelpful			0
chief ombudsman @entity82 said : ‘ the spike in complaints is in part a result of the rising cost of living , but also as a result of consumers becoming more aware of their rights			0
' addressing these concerns is crucial to restoring consumer confidence			0
