a mother whose face was hideously deformed by acid sprayed by her married lover appeared in court today and accused him of ' turning me into a monster '			1
speaking on the first day of @entity9 's trial for attempted murder in @entity11 , @entity12 said she was ' determined to look him in the eye and show the jury what he has done to me '			1
the 48 - year - old , who underwent 86 operations following the attack , added : ' i hope to convince the court that he did indeed want to murder me			1
' before and after : @entity12 was seriously disfigured in the attack allegedly carried out by her ex-lover @entity9 insisted that he did n't realise the sulphuric acid would have such devastating consequences @entity9 , 57 , is said to have planned the sulphuric acid attack after ms @entity12 ended their relationship just over two years ago			1
ms @entity12 told @entity29 that december 1 , 2009 was the day @entity30 ' finally destroyed my life			1
' she said he was waiting for her as she emerged from a lift in the @entity36 suburb of @entity37			2
he sprayed the sulphuric acid , once referred to as ' oil of vitriol ' by medieval @entity42 alchemists , all over her head and upper body , she told the court			1
she said she was convinced she would die , but neighbours in a nearby building heard her screams and managed to get her to the burns unit of a nearby hospital , where she lay in a coma for three months			2
ms @entity12 said : ' i hope @entity9 is convicted of attempted murder , and not just for assault and battery with torture			1
he did not just want to hurt me , he wanted me out of the way			2
i just hope that i get to tell the court what i experienced , and how it hurt			2
trial : @entity12 ( right ) pictured arriving at a @entity36 court with lawyer @entity62 ( left ) for @entity9 's trial accused : @entity9 ( top ) talks with his lawyers on the first day of his trial ' i would also appeal to his wife			1
she paints me as a manipulator who hooked her husband			2
i think that 's an insult - a dagger in my back			2
' he made the first step in starting a relationship , and i had to bring it to a close			1
let 's reverse the roles , but do n't tell me how seriously he should be punished			0
' i leave that to the court , but while working out the punishment do n't lose sight of the fact that he condemned me to pain , both physical and psychological , for life			0
' ms @entity12 said her son â€™s school friends now regularly mock her appearance , adding : ' @entity30 has also ruined my life as a woman			1
who once to deal with the monster that he made me ? ' i 'm stared at on the street			0
worse , i 'm used as an example of what can happen to a woman who wants to put an end to a love affair			0
' a 22 - year - old woman is said to have been threatened by a boyfriend who said : ' remember what happened to @entity12 ? ' , said ms @entity12			1
as well as psychological torture , ms @entity12 said she was in constant physical pain , and all of it reminded her of the horror of the attack			1
brave : @entity12 ( right ) with her lawyer @entity62 ( left ) said her former lover ' destroyed her life ' she said : ' when i look in the mirror , every fibre of my body reminds me of what happened			1
the doctors had me in an artificial coma for months			0
' i lost the sight in my left eye , and hearing in an ear - my right ring finger was amputated			1
by the time i got to my eightieth operation , i stopped counting			0
' but i know that i still have about twenty operations to go			0
the acid which he maimed me , is worse than a weapon of war			2
it still gnaws at me			0
' my nose is quietly shrinking away and will eventually be replaced by a prosthesis			0
that will be the last and perhaps most difficult surgery			0
' for three months i will have to wear a mask to hide the gaping hole in the middle of my face			0
only then can the final prosthesis be implanted			0
' that mask must be removed daily for cleaning			0
no , i will not handle that - a nurse will be doing it			0
' @entity30 has apologised for the attack , denying that he meant to maim her			2
his defence is that he did not realise the sulphuric acid he sprayed would have such a devastating effect			1
@entity9 told the court how he started his relationship with @entity12 , who was the janitor of their block of flats , in 2009			1
he said : ' i moved with my wife and children to the building on @entity162 in 2006			0
@entity12 was already living there			1
at first we just said hello , that 's all			0
' then her relationship with her ex boyfriend ended			1
and , in late 2008 , she asked me two or three time to do small jobs in her house that she could not do herself			0
' one day , at the beginning of 2009 , i offered to go for coffee			0
we went to a hotel and our relationship began			2
' the case continues .			0
