the 80 - year - old criticised the film industry claiming they made films for people with the attention span of ‘ fruit flies ’			1
speaking at the @entity15 today mr @entity1 told how great films require ‘ great plots ’ but that too many today fall into the trap of ‘ crash , bang , wallop effects			1

mr @entity1 said : ‘ too many films are made for a generation with the attention span of fruit flies			0
‘ i heard a depressing fact that films today are made for the 15 year - old to 18 year - old audience , who are there for the quick thrill and the fast affects			1
‘ you see them emerge from the cinema unengaged dragging their arms - i joke - but they are n’t charged up			2
they have had a short lived burst of excitement			1
‘ you ca n’t make a film on an idea you need a great story but sadly a lot of films today are made on special effects and the ‘ crash , bang , wallop ’ effect			1
‘ we are at an age where people go to the cinema and they want dialogue and that is a shame			0
‘ often with these blockbuster films there is lots of shooting , lots of effects , lots of car chases and explosions and not very much substance			2

simplistic : the recent @entity80 film , starring @entity93 , has been panned as ' safe ' and ' simplistic ' ticket - sellers : box office hit action films like @entity97 are the lifeblood of @entity99 these days he said : ‘ now - a - days people meet each other , move in together and sort of get on with it			1
back in my day it was all much more formal than that			0
‘ so when we moved in together after getting married i ’m not sure we really liked each other			0
we definitely were n’t happy for the first year , the first two years for her			2
‘ we had to get used to living with each other before throwing in the towel ... in some ways young people today have the right idea			0
the 80 - year - old former @entity73 journalist was speaking at @entity15 earlier today ‘ but i think the key to happy marriage is space			1
@entity80 loved her sailing and i loved my cricket			0
she would go off on boats and i would spend the day at @entity120 and we would tell each other everything in the evening			0
‘ of course we were both writers we had a huge amount in common but having our own things kept it ticking over			0
