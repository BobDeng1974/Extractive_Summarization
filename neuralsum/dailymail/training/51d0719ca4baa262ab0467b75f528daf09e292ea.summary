by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 07:39 est , 12 april 2013 @entity2 president @entity1 has denied calling @entity3 a ' bully ' amid claims that she had not approved a statement from her office attacking the singer			1
the president is reportedly furious over the statement which accused the star of blackmail , demanding behaviour and bullying state officials on a recent visit to the country			1
according to the @entity20 , the head of @entity2 's @entity19 board , said that president @entity1 ' did not approve ' or know about the statement which came from her office on wednesday			1
it accused her of wanting the government to ‘ roll out the red carpet ’ , adding : ‘ if @entity3 believes she deserved to be treated differently			1
it is worth making her aware that @entity2 has hosted many international stars , including @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature			0
the statement added that @entity3 had n't been invited to the @entity28 country and accused her of exagerrating her contribution to the state			1
return : @entity73 pop star @entity3 sits with the two children she adopted in @entity2 , @entity75 and @entity76 , in a classroom of the @entity32 in the area of @entity79 in @entity34 district promotion : @entity3 uses her star power to highlight the struggle for children in @entity2 it said : ' among the many things that @entity3 needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth			2
' for her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in @entity2 when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with the manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur			0
strong words : president @entity1 had apparently claimed that @entity3 demanded special treatment on her visit to the country ' the difference between a school and a classroom should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher			1
' ' in the feeling of @entity3 , the @entity112 and its leadership should have rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21 - gun salute in her honour because she believes that as a musician , the whiff of whose repute flies across international boundaries , she automatically is candidate for vip treatment , ' the statement read			1
' granted , @entity3 has adopted two children from @entity2			2
according to the record , this gesture was humanitarian and of her accord			0
' it , therefore , comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act , prompted only by her , @entity3 wants @entity2 to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude			2
' kindness , as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned , is free and anonymous			0
' if it ca n't be free and silent , it is not kindness ; it is something else			0
blackmail is the closest it becomes			0
' a ' saddened ' @entity3 had hit back yesterday with a strongly worded statement which accused president @entity1 of ' lies '			1
she pledged to continue her work with the country			0
she said : ' i 'm saddened that @entity2 president @entity1 has chosen to release lies about what we 've accomplished , my intentions , how i personally conducted myself while visiting @entity2 and other untruths			1
' i did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit			2
' i will not be distracted or discouraged by other people 's political agendas			2
' i made a promise to the children of @entity2 and i 'm keeping that promise			0
' @entity3 has been a frequent visitor to @entity2 in recent years after pledging to donate millions to set up schools , orphanges and medical centres in the impoverished state			1
she adopted her son @entity161 in 2006 and daughter @entity76 in 2009 from @entity2			0
giving a hand : the @entity73 performer greeted volunteers at the @entity166 orphanage near @entity167 during her visit			0

president @entity1 was ' *unaware* ' that the statement had been released
it 's the latest development in a war of words since @entity3 's recent visit
the singer had hit back yesterday calling @entity1 's statement ' lies '
