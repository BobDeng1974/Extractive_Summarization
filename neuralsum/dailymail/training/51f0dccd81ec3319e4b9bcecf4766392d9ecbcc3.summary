being gay could be in the dna			1
scientists have found two stretches of dna linked to homosexuality in men			1
the confirmation of the existence of a ‘ gay gene ’ or genes will strengthen arguments that homosexuality is a matter of biology , rather than choice			1
the confirmation of the existence of a ¿ gay gene ¿ or genes will strengthen arguments that homosexuality is a matter of biology , rather than choice			1
other studies suggests that conditions in the womb also influence sexual orientation			0
for instance , the more older male siblings a man has , the greater chance he will be gay			1
scientists say the phenomenon can not be explained by the youngest boy being babied and mollycoddled or other differences in the way they are brought up			0
it is thought that carrying a male baby in the womb triggers an immune response in the mother , creating antibodies that attack part of the unborn child 's brain linked to sexual orientation			1
this response gets stronger the more boys a woman carries , raising the odds of homosexuality			1
exposure to hormones in the womb is also likely to be important and some argue that upbringing plays a role in sexuality			0
however , it also raises the prospect of a genetic test that could be used by insurance companies to discriminate against clients or by pregnant women to abort gay babies			1
in the study , @entity65 researchers analysed the dna of more than 400 pairs of gay brothers , recruited at @entity70 festivals at marches over several years			1
this revealed flagged up two pieces of @entity1 that seem to be linked to homosexuality			1
it is not known which of the many genes they contain are key or how they affect the development of sexual orientation			0
however , the result , revealed at a science event in @entity84 , backs up a contentious 1993 study			0
that research , the first to find evidence of a ‘ gay gene ’ , created a storm of controversy , which was further fuelled when other scientists failed to find a genetic link			1
dr @entity93 from @entity94 in @entity95 , who contributed to the latest study , said it is the biggest of its kind			0
he added : ‘ sexual orientation has nothing to do with choice			1
our findings suggest there may be genes at play – we found evidence for two sets that affect whether a man is gay or straight			1
‘ although this could one day lead to a pre-natal test for male sexual orientation , it would not be very accurate , as there are other factors that can influence the outcome			0
’ despite this , he would not would not object to a prenatal test being developed			0
he said : ‘ clearly parents should not be allowed to torture or kill babies			0
but they can currently choose to terminate a pregnancy early on , so they should be allowed to have as much information on the future child as possible			0
’ @entity65 researchers analysed the dna of more than 400 pairs of gay brothers recruited at @entity70 festivals at marches over several years			2
@entity130 , a @entity131 psychologist , said that genes are thought account for up to 40 per cent of a person ’s sexual orientation is governed by genes , and that it is likely that many genes are involved			0
this would make developing a genetic test incredibly difficult			0
he said : ‘ there is no real risk of anyone finding a ' genetic test ' for sexual orientation based on these or any of the scientific findings about the genetics of sexuality from the past 20 years			0
‘ the reason is that there is no gay gene			1
you are not going to be able to develop a test to find them all			2
’ dr @entity130 , who has written a book about sexual orientation , added that all psychological traits involve genetics and people should not be afraid about link homosexuality to genes			2
@entity162 , of gay rights organisation , @entity164 , said that while studies into the origins of homosexuality have yet to produce convincing evidence , they do to point to a biological root			1
he said : ‘ the thing that ’s consistent across all of them is that they all point to sexual orientation being something fundamental to a person rather than the lifestyle choice some opponents of equality repeatedly suggest			2
’ other studies suggests that conditions in the womb also influence sexual orientation			0

two stretches of @entity1 linked to homosexuality in men discovered
@entity218 *claims* homosexuality is *decided* by biology , not choice
fears breakthrough could be used to develop tests for expecting mothers
*reignites* debate over whether a ' gay gene ' exists
