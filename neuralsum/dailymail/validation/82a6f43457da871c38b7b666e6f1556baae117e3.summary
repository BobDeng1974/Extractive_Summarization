’ @entity198 , chief executive of @entity199 , said : ‘ it is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions			0
they are being targeted for their savings and pensions as well as by individuals specifically looking to exploit their vulnerabilities			0
’ over- 50s specialist firm @entity185 warned that the level of detail on sale about individuals made them more likely to fall victim to ‘ despicable fraud ’			0
age @entity280 said it was particularly troubled by the firm that offered the @entity10 ’s team of ‘ cold - callers ’ undercover reporters £ 500 for every pensioner they could persuade to put £ 20,000 in high - risk investments			1
one of the firms named by the mail , @entity288 , said it welcomes the @entity213 probe and will co-operate fully with any investigation			2

’ by @entity310 controversial plans for a new @entity173 database face growing concerns following the @entity10 ’s revelation that lists of people with medical problems are being touted for sale by unscrupulous data firms			1
doctors have already expressed ‘ grave doubts ’ about the @entity173 plan – called care.data			2
under the scheme , details from every patient ’s @entity326 medical file will be put on one huge database and shared with drug companies			2
officials say the database will be kept secure and anonymous			0
but many doctors have expressed misgivings concerns about the project , with the @entity173 ’s top data expert , professor sir @entity171 , saying last night he was still ‘ very worried ’ about it			2
today the @entity10 reveals how lists of people with medical problems are being treated as potentially rich pickings for those looking to exploit the vulnerable			1
those whose medical details had been sold on said that being on such a list meant they were constantly cold called – with some offered apparently unregulated treatments and medicines by unscrupulous firms			1
critics are likely to feel that if such information was compiled on to one huge database , which was then shared with commercial companies such as drug manufacturers , the risk that it could be used by firms wanting to target the sick could be just too great			1
sir @entity171 , a senior government health adviser , said : ‘ this is the most confidential information you can have on patients			2
‘ among these are very vulnerable people			0
that data should not be available			2
’ many doctors already believe it would be impossible to ensure the detailed information on patients contained in their gp files – which often includes private and sensitive discussions between doctor and patient – would not identify them			2
others have protested that the government has a poor record on keeping peoples ’ data secure and have criticised the move to opt all patients in to the scheme , without their explicit consent			0
some analysts say they could identify individuals in under two hours from the information .			0
