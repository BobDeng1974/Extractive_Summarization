by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 19 september 2013 @entity3 's daughter @entity2 was threatened at gunpoint as she walked with her boyfriend @entity3 ’s daughter @entity2 has been threatened at gunpoint in a botched robbery			1
the young barrister was walking her dog with her boyfriend and a group of friends when the attackers struck			1
the pair were in @entity17 , a mile from the £ 975,000 home her father bought her in 2010 , and near his own central @entity22 property			1
one attacker was said to be wearing a balaclava while the other had his face obscured by a dark scarf			1
neither 25 - year - old @entity28 nor her boyfriend were harmed in the attack , which took place at around 8pm on monday			1
the attempted mugging is thought to be linked to another similar incident in the area on the same night			1
the two attempted robberies took place just half an hour apart and both involved the use of a firearm to threaten a couple			1
a spokesman for the @entity42 said : ‘ @entity2 was with a group of friends			1
no one was hurt and nothing was stolen			1
’ the group were approached by two men , one armed with a gun , and were asked for cash and jewellery before the suspects fled empty - handed			1
@entity55 officers from the @entity57 borough are investigating but no arrests have been made			1
the attack raises concerns for the safety of the @entity42 , who could be targeted due to the former prime minister ’s role as peace envoy to the @entity66 , and to his decision to go to war in @entity69 in 2003			1
one security expert said last night : ‘ it seems staggering that the daughter of a man who evokes such extreme emotions in some should be wandering around in the dark at night without protection			1
‘ to think she had a gun pulled on her and was effectively defenceless raises massive questions about her personal safety			2
thankfully she came to no harm but the potential terrorism threat is obvious			2
’ a neighbour of miss @entity28 said yesterday : ‘ she must have been absolutely terrified			2
i ca n’t imagine what must have gone through her mind when she saw a man pull out a gun			2
my first thought would have been terrorist			2
property : the pair were in @entity17 , a mile from the £ 975,000 home her father bought her in 2010 , and near his own central @entity22 property ( pictured ) ‘ she ’s a lovely girl and we are just relieved she is ok			1
part of her charm is that she is so down to earth			2
‘ you would hardly believe her connections unless you knew her as she appears to live such a normal life but this highlights the danger of not living amid all that security			2
’ another local said she would now be wary of walking the streets in the area after dark			1
dog walker @entity110 , 68 , said : ' it is frightening to know that happened			1
it 's very peaceful around here and i am going to take more care in future			2
' i walk the dog at around 10pm , but i might have to rethink doing that			1
' one elderly resident , who did not want to be named , said she was ' living in fear '			2
she added : ' how terrifying for that poor girl - she must have been so scared when she saw the gun			2
some people will do anything for money , i guess			0
' me and my husband do n't go out late at night so we did n't see anything , but it 's terrifying to hear about it			0
' i wo n't walk down @entity131 and there 's an estate at the top of the road , so i wo n't leave the house when it 's dark			0
' i 'm living in fear anyway , but it 's scary to know people are carrying guns around here			0
' i tried to get a strong gate for my front door a few years ago , but the council said they did n't want ' fortress @entity22 ' outside our house			1
' i 'll definitely be taking even more care in the future			0
' police have responded by putting extra patrols in the surrounding area as their investigations are carried out			0
he showed her a gun , but she managed to run away and nothing was taken			0
detective inspector @entity158 , from @entity57 's @entity159 , said : ' fortunately none of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen			0
' however , being confronted by an armed man is deeply distressing			0
' we are appealing for the public 's help to try and track down the man responsible and his accomplice			0
' if you were out and about around this area on monday night and saw something then please get in touch			1
' detectives are in the process of tracking down cctv from the surrounding area and our investigation is ongoing			0
' extra patrols will be taking place in and around the area over the coming days			0
' a @entity55 spokesman said : ‘ we were alerted at around 8.30pm to two attempted robberies in the street in the @entity17 area			0
' the first happened at 8pm and was carried out by a lone suspect			0
the second occurred approximately 30 minutes later			0
‘ we believe both attempted robberies were carried out by the same male suspect though on the second occasion he was accompanied by another individual			0
@entity2 pictured with her parents @entity3 and @entity194 in 2006			0
the attempted robbery raises concerns about the safety of the @entity42 ‘ neither of the two victims were injured			1
a firearm was shown on each occasion though no shots were discharged			0
officers are investigating both attempted robberies			0
there have been no arrests at this stage			0
‘ we would urge anyone with information to contact us immediately			0
’ miss @entity28 , who was educated in @entity210 , was pictured days before the attack at the wedding of her 29 - year - old brother @entity213 to @entity214 in @entity215			1
she was called to the bar last year by @entity217 – the same inn of court her parents @entity3 and @entity194 joined in the 1970s .			0
