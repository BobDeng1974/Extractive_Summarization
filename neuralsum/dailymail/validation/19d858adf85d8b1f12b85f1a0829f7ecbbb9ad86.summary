@entity0 stares at the camera , her pupils large and black , and her gaze unfaltering			2
her soft skin is peppered with freckles and the corners of her mouth are turned , just slightly , at the corners			2
though she is not quite smiling , she is beautiful in the dim light of the hospital room			2
she has a terminal illness and has accepted that she will soon die			2
she is one of 20 people photographed by @entity14 photographer @entity13 , who spent two years in hospitals taking pictures of people like @entity0 , who are preparing for the end of their life			1
‘ at least i got to see the black president , ’ reads @entity0 ’s page in mr @entity13 ’s new book , @entity23			1
mr @entity13 , who lives in @entity25 , wanted to explore perspective and what people value in their final moments , saying he admired the ‘ brutal honesty ’ displayed in his subjects ’ testimonies			1
he decided to leave out their former professions , or the disease or condition that was killing them , calling these things ‘ the least relevant facts ’			2
instead , as well as the haunting pictures , he gathered stories from their lives , vignettes of experience and fragments of how they would advise others			1
here , in an extract from his book , he shares some of the photographs and accompanying words ... @entity0 , in her hospital bed			1
she said : ‘ time is so precious			2
@entity55 , it 's precious			1
life is definitely not infinite			1
you never know what is going to come up and you really have to take risks			2
i ca n’t really think about what ’s fair – fair does n’t make any sense			2
things are not fair or unfair , it ’s just the way life is			1
things happen – or they do n’t			0
you take opportunities – or you do n’t ’ @entity68 , pictured in hospital , said she has never been afraid to die : ‘ if you ’re dead , you ’re dead			0
it does n’t come back and i do n’t think we reincarnate			0
i know the @entity72 says otherwise and i do n’t want to contradict it , but to me , i do n’t believe that			0
when we die , we die and we go to nothing			0
dust to dust ... i think the @entity76 reaches you when you die ’ @entity77 said his biggest regret is not being in touch with his daughter in @entity81			1
he said : ‘ i did n’t give her the right to be part of my life			1
’ he adds that there is ‘ no such thing as happiness in life ’			1
‘ what we call happiness are contributions ; all we have is what we are and what we have given at that moment			0
the meaning of life is the search for it ’ @entity101 wrote just these brief words to accompany his photo			1
he said : ‘ i feel like i am the luckiest man in the world			0
i have a wonderful wife , son and daughter , grandchildren and great grandchildren			0
no one could ask for more than that ' @entity113 said she was taking care of her sick brothers and sisters when she developed cancer			1
she said being in love is the greatest happiness in life : ‘ being in love is like being in a different world			1
you can take anything that ’s dished out because there ’s someone who cares for you			0
happiness to me is when you feel good and you make somebody else feel good			0
you do n’t even know what you ’re doing and you ’re making someone happy ’ @entity130 said people should take the opportunity to tell others how they feel			1
she said : ‘ i ’ll be remembered by my mom and kids for how much i care about everybody			0
and i show it a lot because i think you should			0
i do n’t think you should hold something like that back because we do n’t know how long we ’re here and if you love somebody you should tell them			0
they do n’t have to love you back but i think that if you love somebody that they should know it because you never know – you do n’t know what ’s going to happen tomorrow ’ @entity151 said although she has suffered hardship , she has no regrets			2
she said : ‘ with my first husband i chose someone not knowing that he was a bad guy			0
i had never been with a man before and from day one throughout all six years of that marriage i had been hit ... to the point where i had to go to work with bruises all over my body , raped many , many times and everything else			1
the day after my second son died , i came home and my husband punched me in the forehead , there was blood all over the place			0
a week after that , i left with my other son and we went to @entity160			0
i went on with my life , i went to school and i never asked for child support or anything			1
i am very happy , actually , and i do n’t have regrets even though i ’ve been through hell			2
as far as i know , i ’ve accomplished what i ’ve had to accomplish in my life ’ @entity182 said being loved makes people offer love to others			1
she said : ' i think growing up with love makes people give love back			1
and you have to five love to receive love , you have to be good without expecting anything in return			0
you do it because it comes from within you to do it			0
i ’ve always fought to improve myself and risen to the occasion			0
it ’s what i was taught growing up and was very ingrained in me			0
i think that ’s what i ’ll be remembered for when i pass on ’ the exhibition , @entity23 , is being held at the @entity201 , @entity202 , until 28th june 2015 .			1
