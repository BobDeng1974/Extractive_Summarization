a mineral formed by biological processes has been found in rocks that were 12 miles beneath @entity4 ’s surface 100 million years ago			1
if the finding is confirmed , it will be among the deepest signs of life ever discovered			0
and it could also have implications for life on other worlds , suggesting that more regions of @entity4 are habitable than we anticipated			2
scientists from @entity16 have found evidence for ancient underground life			1
a mineral called aragonite ( stock image shown ) was found in rocks that are now on the surface			1
a specific mix of carbon isotopes suggests the aragonite found came from subsurface methane made by microorganisms the finding was made by a team from @entity16 on @entity32 ’s @entity31			1
the mineral found in the rocks was something known as aragonite , which can form both biologically and by natural processes			1
however , in this instance the scientists found a specific mix of carbon isotopes that indicate it has biological origins			1
back in june 2011 scientists were left stunned by the discovery of a worm that lives deeper than any known animal on @entity4			2
the discovery of @entity49 , a new species , 2.2 miles ( 3.5km ) below the surface in a @entity53 gold mine amazed scientists as it had previously been thought that only single - celled bacteria could survive at such depths			1
the worm - a bacteria - feeding nermtode that is just 0.02 inches ( 0.5mm ) long - was found at various depths of between 0.6 and 2.2miles ( 0.97 and 3.5km )			0
it lives in the @entity62 ( 118 ° f ) water that seeps between cracks that are deep below the surface			0
' it 's like finding @entity68 in @entity69 , ’ lead researcher dr @entity65 , of @entity66 said at the time			0
carbon dating suggested they have lived at such depths for between 3,000 and 10,000 years in an environment with just 1 per cent the oxygen levels found in oceans			0
the worms may have originated on the surface but were washed down into the cracks of @entity4 ’s crust by ancient rainwater			2
the findings suggest this aragonite came from methane made by microorganisms			1
‘ these really light signals are only observed when you have biological processes , ’ @entity85 , an undergraduate at @entity16 , told @entity86			2
the aragonite was found in an outcrop 165ft ( 50 metres ) long that lies in a fault zone 1.9 miles ( 3km ) thick called the @entity94			2
it ’s thought the life may have originated in a subduction zone deep beneath the surface of @entity4 where two tectonic plates came into contact			1
here , it may have been possible for water to be embedded in the subsurface rocks			0
over 100 million years the rocks were gradually pushed upwards and are now seen on the surface			1
exactly what sort of life it would have been is not known , but it would likely have been simply bacteria or other simple microorganisms			0
if life did survive at these great depths , it would have had to endure temperatures of more than 122 ° @entity116 )			0
high pressure may have enabled life to live even at such high temperatures underground , but nonetheless it would be an extreme environment in which microorganisms could survive			2
and discovering life in such environments could aid scientists in their hunt for life on other planets besides @entity4			1
the discovery was made in an outcrop of rocks on @entity32 ’s @entity31 ( shown )			1
100 million years ago these were 12 miles ( 20km ) underground before being gradually brought to the surface			1
life could have survive in the rocks between tectonic plates it ’s thought the life may have originated in a subduction zone ( shown ) deep beneath the surface of @entity4 where two tectonic plates came into contact			1
here , it may have been possible for water to be embedded in the subsurface rocks			0
over 100 million years the rocks were gradually pushed upwards as life is found in more and more extreme environements , it raises hopes that some form of past or present microbial life may be found on other worlds in our solar system besides @entity156			1
and it may ultimately force us to rethink the characteristics that enable us to label a planet beyond the solar system ' habitable ' , suggesting even more may be habitable than thought			0
‘ at low surface pressures , bacterial life is know to remain active to temperatures of about 122 ° @entity116 ] , ’ the researchers write			0
‘ biomolecules are stabilised by pressure , so bacterial life should extend to higher temperatures within the @entity4 's interior			0
‘ we suggest that the @entity31 aragonite veins are evidence of this deep life			2
’ the team presented their findings at the @entity176 ’s annual meeting in @entity177 , @entity178			0
life has already been found in a variety of bizarre environments on @entity4			2
here tiny crabs and other sea life live next to a hot hydrothermal vent on the ocean 's floor			0
the heat and minerals expelled by the vent allow these creatures to survive without sunlight			0
the latest discovery could have implications for finding alien life			0

scientists from @entity16 have found evidence for ancient underground life on @entity32 ’s @entity199
a mineral called aragonite was found in rocks that are now on the surface
but 100 million years ago they were 12 miles ( 20km ) underground
@entity209 can form from both biological and *physical* processes
however a specific mix of carbon isotopes suggests the aragonite found came from methane made by microorganisms
the life could have survived in subsurface water between tectonic plates
@entity222 would be among the deepest life ever found on @entity4
and it would suggest life on @entity4 and maybe other planets can survive in even more extreme environments than we thought
