by @entity1 reporter published : 21:11 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 24 march 2013 @entity3 's most economically divided neighbourhoods have been revealed in a wide - ranging survey of the country 's wealth gap			1
a study by data company @entity8 found streets where wealthy families in £ 1m homes live ' cheek by jowl ' with some of the most deprived households in the country			1
neighbouring streets in @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are revealed as among the areas with the biggest wealth disparity			1
economically divided neighbourhood : @entity24 , west @entity25 affluent : @entity27 , which is round the corner from @entity24 the analysis was based on factors such as income , savings , investments and property values			1
@entity35 of @entity8 , which categorises every household into one of 62 demographic types , told @entity39 : ' our analysis shows the biggest divides are within communities rather than across the oft - quoted north - south divide			1
' @entity3 is most divided at a local level and these social , health and financial disparities will only increase			2
' one of the sharpest income gaps in the @entity8 survey was between @entity50 and @entity51 in @entity20			1
only 50 yards apart as the crow flies , they are separated by a railway line so it is a two - mile trip between them			2
the average income in @entity50 is £ 66,000 and people living there are three times more likely than the national average to be paying higher - rate tax			1

@entity82 and @entity83 across the railway line in @entity86 , however , the average income is just £ 20,200 — a difference of 227 per cent , @entity39 reported			2
according to the @entity89 , inequality is back at levels last seen in the mid- 1990s			0
' the immediate effect of the most recent recession was to reduce inequality in 2010 - 11 because benefits stayed flat while wages fell , but as tax and benefit reforms come in over the next few years you would expect to see inequality increase again , ' said @entity100 of the @entity89			0
research suggests extreme wealth disparity can have a negative impact on health and wellbeing			1
a study by @entity107 found that while people in wealthier neighbourhoods generally had better health , this was not true for poor mothers living in affluent areas			2
higher incidences of schizophrenia in urban areas have also been attributed to an increase in inequality , according to research by @entity120 published in the journal @entity122 .			0
