@entity0 wants the current @entity2 squad to stop calling him ‘ mr @entity0 ’			1
he wants to stop having to tell them how it feels to be a winner because none of them know			2
he wants them to start writing their own history , starting with lifting the @entity11 at @entity12			0
it feels fitting that @entity0 is speaking at @entity14 in east @entity15 , in front of a black and white poster screaming ‘ @entity18 ’			0
he is incredulous that @entity2 could be stifled by the tag of favourites and seems equally unimpressed as he explains @entity21 believes he has a squad capable of winning the @entity23			1
mr @entity2 : @entity0 ( left ) won plenty of trophies as @entity2 skipper including the 1989 league title tear it down : @entity0 has been honoured with a statue , but wants this generation to write a new history but then @entity0 , as he puts it , ‘ likes winning things ’			1
the former @entity2 captain can look back on four @entity23 titles , three @entity37 and two @entity38 between 1987 and 2002			1
if his old club secure fourth place in the @entity42 and the @entity11 this season it would only mean the campaign has ‘ not been a failure ; not like having to play in the @entity45 like @entity46 ’			0
he adds : ‘ none of this @entity2 team knows what it ’s like to win a trophy for the club			1
@entity21 remembers , but not these players			1
‘ i did a q&a with some of the players the other week , and all the questions about winning were coming to me because they did n’t have the answers			1
‘ i was talking to @entity58 and @entity59 and i was telling them : “ you need to know how it feels just to get over the line ” because it ’s a weird feeling			0
‘ it was normal for us to win games			2
i ’m not so sure this group of players has that			2
‘ they call me mr @entity0 and stuff ! i ’m not sure i ever called older players “ mister ”			2
ambition : @entity21 badly wants to win the @entity23 after coming so close in 2006 , says @entity0 learning to win : @entity0 has had to answer questions about success to both @entity79 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) ‘ i want them to be pushing me to the side and ripping my statue down and make their own history			1
‘ they ’re lovely guys , but they need leadership			2
@entity84 ’s a good pro without being , for me , a great player , but he will say “ come on ”			1
‘ ( per ) @entity89 ’s been more verbal this year			1
i had a go at @entity91 at the beginning of the season and said : “ you do n’t have to be mr @entity94 , you do n’t have to be liked			0
” you do n’t just go through your career letting it go by and missing the moment			0
’ @entity0 believes @entity21 had ‘ 10 easy years ’ in his first decade at @entity2 , having inherited that famous back five and an ‘ unbelievable squad ’ of players ‘ ready to be taught ’			1
the 47 - year - old thinks the @entity101 should sign a new contract at the club , regardless of the outcome at @entity12 , but disagrees with @entity21 ’s optimism about the potential of his squad to win @entity109 ’s most glittering prize			1
leaders : both @entity84 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) have had to learn to be more assertive this season ‘ i think @entity21 really wants to win the @entity23 , ’ says @entity0 , ‘ and i think he still thinks this group of players can do it for him			1
while he ’s still got that belief , he ’ll stick around			0
‘ if he thought that this squad could n’t win him the @entity23 i think he ’d move on to @entity116 or a club that would deliver that for him before he goes to @entity119			1
‘ do i share that optimism ? no , i do n’t			0
i do n’t think the full backs are good enough			0
they ’ve really struggled this year			0
‘ but i think @entity21 should stay			2
i think , financially , he does fantastic for the club and there ’s a great structure in place and better the devil you know			0
‘ he came in to take over an unbelievable squad , with an untapped @entity101 market , and he found a captain who had sobered up six weeks ago and was ready to grab life , instead of grabbing a pint , so a lot of his circumstances are to do with timing			2
‘ when the teacher appeared , that team was ready to run			0
i think he had 10 easy years , really			0
’ in conjunction with the @entity140 and to mark @entity141 , @entity0 is promoting a gala charity boxing night at @entity143 , @entity15 , on friday 27th june			0
tickets are available at @entity145 and proceeds will go to the @entity147 .			0
