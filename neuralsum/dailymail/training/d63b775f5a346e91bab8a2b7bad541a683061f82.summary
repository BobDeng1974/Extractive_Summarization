by @entity0 fathers who have a good relationship with their children and are happy to help out with household chores have happier marriages , a new study has revealed			1
but the survey , conducted by researchers from the @entity9 and @entity10 , also warned of the pitfalls of divvying up chores between husband and wife , finding that marriages were happier when couples worked together on each job			1
men , traditionally , are made responsible for heavier jobs such as taking out the dustbin , while women tend to take on chores such as washing up and hoovering			2
this , say researchers , is a mistake			2
happy : couples who do the housework together are more likely to have a good relationship ' we found that it did n't matter who did what , but how satisfied people were with the division of labour , ' said @entity35 professor @entity34			2
' we found that when wives are doing work together with their husbands , they are more satisfied with the division of labor			0
' the study , which was published in the @entity43 , looked at how 160 couples handled housework and child - rearing duties in an attempt to discover what contributed to the quality of a married relationship			1
the quality of the fathers ' relationship with their children was found to be the single most important factor , followed by willingness to do the housework alongside their wives			1
' for women , their husband having a good relationship with the kids means that the parents are probably going to have a better relationship , ' @entity34 said			0
the study measured fatherly involvement in a number of ways including playing with children , engaging in shared interests and providing teaching moments			0
@entity73 : those who split chores or who do n't divide them equally will find marriage harder to cope with quality time : fathers who have a good relationship with their children have happier marriages ' something as simple as reading a book with your children every night and talking with them about their day can really go a long way , " said @entity82 , a graduate of @entity83 's @entity35 who co-authored the study			1
most of the parents were between the ages of 25 and 30 and all of the couples had a child age 5 or younger			0
' this stage of life , where couples have young children , is potentially really challenging for couples , ' @entity34 said			0
previous research by @entity34 showed that both husbands and wives dramatically increase their household tasks during the transition to parenthood			0
typically fathers do twice as much housework after the first baby arrives			1
mothers , however , do about five times more housework than before			2
' when wives are satisfied with the division of labor , both spouses report higher marital quality , ' @entity34 said			0
in other words , couples who clean together , stay together			0
research : the study was conducted by @entity10 ( above ) and the @entity9			1

study done by the @entity9 and @entity10
chores should be done together rather than split , researchers found
fathers typically double the amount of chores they do after a child arrives
mothers , however , find themselves doing five times as much as before
