by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 10:18 est , 1 august 2013 every year , the fashion world waits with baited breath for @entity3 to draw up its famous @entity4			2
and now the wait is finally over as the most fashionable people of 2013 have been declared			0
some of the choices were far from surprising			0
@entity8 of @entity9 makes the list for the fourth time since she first appeared in 2008			1
and the @entity12 does n't want for royal companions either			1
@entity14 of @entity15 is also on the list , as is @entity17			1
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 also appeared , as did @entity31			0
there were the obvious choices , and then the more intriguing ones			0
@entity36 , the wife of the @entity38 president @entity37 , makes her debut this year			1
it 's an interesting choice ; @entity36 , who is also a singer and performing artist , has been feted for adding some glamour to her husband 's staid office			0
but if the list charts those whose star is on the rise , those whom it excludes must feel the burn			1
with that in mind , it 's interesting that the @entity4 's compilers have failed to include @entity56 - for the second year running			1
( @entity57 has n't appeared since 2009 )			2
lighthearted : @entity58 with his wife @entity59 in fact , the wives of @entity62 politicians are conspicuously absent			0
@entity64 has n't appeared since she was included for the first time in 2010			1
and , while @entity66 is a veteran of the @entity4 , having appeared four times , the wife of the former @entity70 president is n't in the list this year			1
for some , the list is a sacred affair , but there are those who treat it more lightheartedly			2
while @entity59 , appearing in the @entity78 category with husband @entity58 , said her favourite item of clothing is ' my wedding dress , made by @entity83 ' , @entity58 said his were his ' @entity84 '			0
he added that his style icon is @entity88 actress ' @entity86 as @entity89 in @entity90			0
' when asked who his is , @entity92 , new to the @entity4 , responded , ' why should i [ have one ] ... i am one ! ' he also insisted that ' i do n't shop ! ' @entity92 and @entity23 featured on the coveted list other newbies include @entity21 and @entity22			1
the burlesque dancer said her favourite article of clothing is " the ' @entity99 ' gown from @entity101 's 2002 winter haute couture collection			0
' fittingly , her style icons are ' the women of 1940s - era fetish artist @entity104			2
' @entity105 , a writer , human - rights lawyer and diplomat but better known as the son of @entity109 and @entity110 , was also included			1
for the first time in its history , the fashion 's who 's who has been opened up to the public			2
the @entity118 , as it was known , invited submissions from readers			0
fashion blogger @entity121 and interior designer @entity122 were selected			0
@entity121 's style icon is @entity124 ; @entity122 's styel icon is ' @entity126 with a touch of @entity128 and the @entity129 thrown in '			0
human rights lawyer and diplomat @entity105 ( l ) @entity38 's first lady @entity36 ( r ) were included			1

@entity12 , a veteran of the list , has been on it four times
@entity38 first lady included - while @entity56 and @entity137 are n't
@entity21 , @entity22 and @entity92 included for the first time
