by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was handed the perfect conditions to exact his revenge on an @entity6 side who are trying to get him expelled from this @entity9 series			2
but when push came to shove , a golden opportunity was wasted			0
@entity2 was not short of motivation on the first day of the second test with a potential four - match suspension hanging over him thanks to @entity6 ’s insistence that he ‘ abused and pushed ’ @entity17 in the @entity19 pavilion			1
yet even though @entity2 , who hotly disputes the charge , broke two significant records , @entity20 were left wondering what might have been as @entity6 were allowed to score at least a hundred more than they should			2
it is bounce and carry that @entity20 want from pitches more than seam movement but they will never have a better chance of skittling opponents on the first day of a @entity58 on a rare green surface most bowlers would die for			0
instead , @entity6 were allowed to recover from the depths of 145 for seven to close on 290 for nine as @entity27 , one of the new breed of @entity64 batsmen , took the attack to @entity20 and left them desperately needing to bat well			2
in truth , @entity2 was the least culpable of an @entity20 attack who bowled too short and wide for all but a middle session when they took four wickets for 67 and finally located the right line and lengths for the conditions			0
@entity2 became both the leading @entity77 wicket - taker in @entity20 and then in @entity41 ’s history with his first and second wickets , ending up with four victims in all after @entity81 had won what turned out to be an important toss			1
resistance : @entity6 's @entity27 moved passed his half - century to frustrate @entity20 's bowlers bat raised : @entity27 ( right ) acknowledges the @entity41 's crowd has he scores a half - century smashed : @entity27 gladly accepts yet another short ball from @entity90 and dispatches it to the boundary but @entity2 will have been disappointed both by his bowling before lunch and after tea and the fact that he was not able to aim a single delivery at either of his @entity19 accusers , @entity17 and @entity6 captain @entity98			1
it was left to @entity100 to dismiss @entity98 , too high at six in these conditions , and then @entity102 to claim @entity17 during an @entity104 purple patch when @entity6 ’s initial stubborn defence looked to be counting for little			2
and when @entity106 was incorrectly given lbw by @entity108 umpire @entity107 – the lack of @entity110 costing @entity6 again – @entity20 were on the brink of the position of dominance they have craved during their long winless run			0
racking up runs : @entity27 ( right ) and @entity115 ( left ) continue on their way to a 90 - run eighth wicket partnership caught : @entity119 ( right ) takes the chance off @entity2 at third slip and @entity122 is on his way record breaker : @entity2 celebrates getting @entity122 and becoming the leading test wicket taker in @entity20 but @entity27 , highly rated by @entity6 coach @entity126 for his fighting qualities , joined forces with the tailender who @entity20 could not budge at @entity19 in @entity115 to change the course of the day			1
@entity20 , barely believably , resorted to @entity90 ’s flat pitch enforcer tactics to little effect as @entity27 and @entity115 added 90 for the eighth wicket and then @entity27 put on another 40 in rapid time with @entity135			1
only when @entity2 took a superb one - handed return catch to send back @entity27 for 103 off 154 balls , his second 50 coming off just 50 balls , could @entity20 breathe a sigh of relief at not totally squandering their advantage			1
safe hands : @entity119 's diving catch sends @entity144 back to the pavilion off @entity90 's bowling got him : @entity147 celebrates the second of his two outstanding catches on day one at @entity29 grounded : @entity151 drops a diving chance to dismiss @entity144 in front of @entity81 sparks were expected to fly here with relations between these teams at a low ebb because of the accusation levelled by @entity6 against @entity2 and then the counter claim thrown back at @entity17 by an indignant @entity20			1
yet there was barely a cross word exchanged all day , with any fighting between the teams saved , for now , for tuesday ’s preliminary @entity166 disciplinary hearing that will be heard by @entity108 judicial commissioner @entity167			0
all eyes were on @entity2 after @entity81 had taken the plunge and decided to bowl but it was another @entity20 player who has endured a difficult week who made the initial impression on a sun - soaked @entity41 ’s crowd			2
@entity119 escaped disciplinary action after pictures of him shirtless and the worse for wear in a @entity180 nightclub emerged on wednesday but he was seeing the ball clearly yesterday as he pouched the two smart catches that gave @entity20 their only two pre-lunch wickets			0
saying nothing : @entity81 keeps his reaction muted after prior missed a golden chance for a wicket tweaker : @entity102 jumps for joy after claiming the wicket of @entity17 massive wicket : @entity100 shows how much the wicket of @entity98 means to the @entity20 players frustrated : @entity100 throws his head back as @entity27 and @entity115 fought back thankfully @entity119 , who was reminded of his responsibilities by coach @entity196 , resisted the urge , a la @entity199 and @entity198 , to take off his shirt again and wave it around his head in celebration			1
@entity6 could manage only 73 runs in the first session and six fewer between lunch and tea but all that changed as 150 runs were clattered in the final session and any confidence @entity20 had garnered was sapped from them			0
@entity81 was hindered by the afternoon absence of @entity90 , who had a tight hamstring , and the continuing travails of @entity151 , who dropped another two catches before lunch to make it six missed opportunities in all this summer			0
prior seems to have a problem moving to his right , where he has had both achilles and thigh injuries , and a wicket - keeper batsman who has been a very good cricketer for @entity20 is fighting now against the ravages of time			0
@entity20 , meanwhile , are now in a much bigger second test fight than they should be			0
big call : @entity81 won the toss but chose to field first in the second test against @entity6 at @entity29			1

@entity27 was dismissed by @entity2 late in the day for 103
@entity2 claimed 4 - *55* and set a number of records along the way
he passed @entity2*36* as the highest test wicket - taker in @entity20
and beat @entity240 's mark to take the most test wickets at @entity29
@entity27 put on 90 for the eighth - wicket with @entity115 ( *36* )
@entity100 took two wickets , @entity102 and @entity25 got one each
@entity81 won the toss and sent @entity6 in to bat on day one
