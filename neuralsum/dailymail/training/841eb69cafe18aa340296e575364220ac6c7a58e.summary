a @entity1 - based designer and art director has embarked on a project which aims to catalog the intricate mosaic @entity5 signs of @entity1 's vast underground network – and reveal their untold stories			1
@entity9 , a @entity10 native , has been quietly looking past the grimy , crowded tunnels that snake beneath the city to find beauty in the unique ceramic art works that have stood for over a century , often unappreciated			2
so far , he has covered 118 stations , which he photographs and then digitally illustrates , and has spent 20 hours riding trains to document the signs for his @entity18			1
art : designer @entity21 has launched the @entity18 , which catalogs his illustrations of the beautiful mosaic signs of @entity25 's @entity1 subway system , including this sign for @entity27 ' one day while waiting for the 6 train at the @entity27 stop , i began to notice the intricate details of the carefully placed tiles in the station sign , ' he writes of his project			1
' which led me to noticing other station signs and how they were all different , infused with the personality of the neighborhood			0
' the @entity1 @entity40 - one of the world 's oldest and largest - first opened in october of 1904 , and its creators , @entity43 and @entity44 , opted to use ceramic tiles to craft the signs because they would be long - lasting and easy to keep clean			1
begin your trip : mr @entity9 has so far captured 118 stations and aims to eventually cover the whole of the @entity51 network			1
his photos are organized online by train line ( pictured ) intricate : the project is made up mr @entity21 's digital illustrations of the signs , which he first travels to and photographs , such as this example ( pictured ) of a sign for the @entity62 stop old : @entity1 's subway system is one of the oldest and the largest in the world , first opening in 1904 - this sign for @entity68 ( pictured ) dates to 1917 and they were right about them lasting			1
the signs have largely stood the test of time , with newer works installed every year on the network			0
throughout several re-designs of @entity25 's network , including a major brand overhaul in 1970 which altered the maps and color coding of the lines , the mosaic signs have always remained immune to change			0
many of the illustrative mosaics that appear were originally intended not only to be aesthetically pleasing , but to offer non-english speakers and tourists clues as to where they were going			0
unnoticed : mr @entity9 says he traveled the @entity5 for many years before he began to notice the beauty in the intricate mosaic signs practical : the signs were originally fashioned from mosaic tiles because they were long - lasting and easy to clean claim to fame : this station can be seen in the backdrop of @entity96 's ' i 'm afraid of @entity99 ' music video , just one among several stops to have appeared in movies and videos over the years many of the signs mr @entity9 has captured and added to his online gallery include snippets of long - forgotten , or never before told information about each station ’s history			1
for example , the @entity112 ’s @entity111 station , where the @entity113 and z trains stop , houses a ' @entity116 ' which enables the construction of another opening - one that has never been needed as @entity111 has historically been one of the most under - used stops on the @entity25 network			0
similarly , the f train ’s @entity122 station has a strip of mosaic around a quaint locked door , behind which is a level that was intended for the never - built @entity130 line			0
history lesson : the @entity111 station ( pictured ) is one of few to house a ' @entity116 ' which was built to enable a new underground opening , yet to be used in this case secret : behind this locked door ( pictured ) , there 's another level that was intended for an unbuilt line , captured by mr @entity9 , who wants his gallery to serve as a ' tribute ' to the history of the @entity25 some of the stations have appeared in movies and music videos			2
the 1 train ’s @entity149 station in the @entity151 can be seen in the backdrop of @entity96 's ' i 'm afraid of @entity99 ' video , while the 1 and 2 train ’s entire 23rd street station on @entity157 gets destroyed in the 1998 version of @entity159			0
' i hope this gallery can serve as not only a tribute to the history of the subway stations but also as a quick guide to getting around @entity1 via the @entity25 , ' says mr @entity9			2
@entity165 is now selling premium @entity166 which feature the tile designs for $ 38 a pop.			0

@entity9 has illustrated signs from 118 stations for his @entity18
@entity1 's @entity5 , built in 1904 , is one of the largest and oldest mass - *transit* networks in the world
