by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 02:34 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 18 october 2013 executed : @entity3 , seen in this undated photo , was executed on tuesday using an untried drug a @entity7 man convicted of raping and murdering a 21 - year - old woman in 1986 made a shock confession moments before he was executed by lethal injection of a controversial , never - before used drug			1
facing 17 members of his victim 's family , @entity3 , 51 - the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride - told those gathered to watch his death : ' for 27 years , the horrible murder of @entity17 has been clouded by circumstantial evidence and uncertainty			1
' for the sake of her family , loved ones and all concerned , it is to my agonising shame that i must confess to this terrible crime			1
' @entity33 , the victim 's brother , said the confession had come as a shock to his family			1
' you need to ask somebody a lot more important than me for forgiveness , ' he told @entity3			1
minutes later @entity3 blinked repeatedly and shook his head back and forth as he was executed			1
the drug was used despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict cruel and unusual punishment on the death row inmate			1
the execution began at 6.02pm at @entity50 in @entity51			1
@entity3 's eyes opened and he blinked several times			1
he closed them and opened them again two minutes later			2
he then yawned and his jaw dropped open			2
at 6.08pm , the official overseeing the execution tugged at @entity3 's eyelids and grasped his shoulder to check for a response			1
victim : @entity64 , pictured , was just 21 when she was kidnapped , raped and murdered by @entity3 in 1986			1
@entity3 was executed on tuesday @entity3 appeared to remain conscious for a greater length of time and made more body movements after losing consciousness than people executed by the old formula which usually kills the prisoner within seven minutes			1
@entity72 , typically used by doctors for sedation , was the first of three drugs pumped into @entity3 as part of a lethal injection cocktail designed to induce unconsciousness , paralysis and death by cardiac arrest			1
the first of the drugs administered as part of the lethal injection ' protocol ' in @entity7 has long been the barbiturate pentobarbital			2
but @entity7 and other death penalty states that use a trio of drugs as part of their injection procedures have been running out of pentobarbital since its manufacturer clamped a ban on its use in future executions			1
' this is somewhat of an experiment on a living human being , ' @entity98 , executive director of the @entity99 in @entity100 , said monday			2
lethal dose : @entity3 was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride , pictured , despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict undue pain ' the three - drug process depends on the first drug rendering the inmate unconscious and , if he is only partially unconscious , the inmate could be experiencing extreme pain , ' he added			1
' because the second drug paralyzes him , he would be unable to cry out or show that he 's in pain			2
' the 51 - year - old @entity3 , who had abandoned his appeals and said he was ready to die , was condemned for the 1986 abduction , rape and murder of @entity64 , whose body was found on a canal bank near @entity123 in central @entity7			1
@entity3 was calm when he met with two spiritual advisers , including a @entity126 priest who administered last rites , according to @entity129 spokeswoman @entity128			1
for his last meal , @entity3 had a 12 - ounce box of assorted chocolates and 1 1/2 quarts of @entity134 chocolate ice - cream			1
' to my agonizing shame , i must confess to the crime , ' he said in a slow , deliberate voice before the injection was given			1
' i wish to offer my most sincere , heartfelt apology			2
i have prayed for the good lord to forgive me for my sins			2
but i understand why those here can not			2
' @entity17 's mother and two siblings died before they could see the sentence carried out , but @entity17 's surviving sisters and brothers traveled to @entity51 to watch as @entity3 was executed			1
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity150 of @entity151 , said there were no late motions to stay the execution			1
@entity3 told a circuit judge in @entity156 , @entity7 , last month that he did not want to continue the court appeals that have kept him on @entity7 's death row for nearly a quarter - century			1
another condemned @entity7 prisoner , @entity159 , has a hearing set for a november 6 in @entity162 's federal court , challenging the use of midazolam			2
@entity159 's appeal contends that there is ' substantial risk ' of midazolam not working completely , violating the @entity170 's prohibition of ' cruel and unusual punishment ' by subjecting the condemned to a painful paralysis and fatal heart seizure over several minutes			2
@entity64 was making her first long trip through @entity7 on @entity175 weekend in 1986 but she never arrived at her destination			1
she prearranged with her friend to meet at a convenience store in @entity123 so she could be guided the last few miles of the trip			0
