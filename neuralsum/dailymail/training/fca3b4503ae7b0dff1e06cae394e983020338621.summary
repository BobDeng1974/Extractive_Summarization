@entity0 has displayed a growing impatience with injured striker @entity2 , saying he is not interested if the @entity4 star has become frustrated over his slow return to fitness for @entity7 and telling him to just follow orders			1
@entity2 has yet to complete 90 minutes since joining @entity7 on a one - season loan from @entity10 in the summer , and is running out of time to convince the club to sign him permanently in a deal worth a total of £ 52million			1
the 28 - year - old earns £ 280,000 a week at @entity16 but has so far made just seven appearances — four of them as a substitute — and scored one goal			1
@entity34 insists the former @entity36 and @entity37 striker can not currently play for more than 20 minutes and has used him off the bench in the last two games , preferring to put teenager @entity40 in the starting line - up against @entity42 in midweek when @entity43 was out with a knee injury			1
@entity43 is expected to return alongside @entity45 in attack at @entity47 on monday night			1
asked if @entity2 is frustrated over his lack of progress , @entity34 brushed aside the question saying : ‘ i ’m not interested			2
he has to follow my philosophy			2
do you understand that ? yeah , i ’m here because of that			0
’ the @entity7 boss indicated that he would rather have seen @entity2 train more or play for the reserves than sit on the bench against @entity59 and @entity42 , but his hand was forced by the injuries to @entity40 and @entity43			1
‘ a bigger contribution is to play in the second team for 45 or 60 minutes or even 90 minutes , ’ said @entity34			0
‘ but i could n’t do that because i needed him when @entity43 was injured ( for @entity42 ) and @entity40 was injured ( for @entity59 )			1
' i selected him in spite of the fact he can only play 20 minutes at this level because the rhythm of the game in the @entity71 is the highest			0
’ @entity7 can move above @entity47 and @entity72 into third place in the table if they extend their four - match winning run at @entity77 ’s			1
@entity40 was prefered to @entity2 for @entity7 's home match against @entity42 last week @entity2 was only used in the final 12 minutes by @entity34 in the 2 - 1 win against @entity81 ' side @entity47 boss @entity82 has offered a hand of friendship to @entity34 by backing his fellow countryman to restore @entity7 to the glories their fans once took for granted			1
@entity82 and @entity34 have been at each other ’s throats since a spectacular fall - out when the @entity91 were manager and sporting director at @entity94 in 2004			0
but this is the season of goodwill and @entity82 appears ready to end the decade - long conflict			0
‘ he ’s a great coach , ’ said @entity82 of his one - time mentor			0
‘ he needs time and he will get it at @entity7			2
@entity34 gives his then assistant @entity82 instructions during their time together at @entity103 while @entity7 have struggled , @entity47 have exceeded expectations under @entity105 ' the manager has a lot of experience and they have the money to buy the best players so of course they will be challengers			2
’ when pressed on their relationship , @entity82 did admit : ‘ i do n’t say it is good ; it ’s correct and that ’s the best word			0
what happened before was a working problem and i have to explain it like that			0
‘ it ’s not an issue because it is eight or nine years ago			0
’ @entity125 ' top four finish far from certain ' - @entity34			0

@entity2 has featured in just seven games for @entity7 since joining from @entity10 in the summer
the 28 - year - old was recently out for six weeks with a calf problem
*youngster* @entity40 was picked ahead of the @entity4 star in the *absence* of @entity43 for last week 's game against @entity42
@entity0 says @entity2 must follow his philosophy or he wo *n't* succeed at @entity7
the on - loan striker has scored just once for the @entity139 so far
