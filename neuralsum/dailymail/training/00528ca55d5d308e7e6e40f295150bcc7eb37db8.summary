' he is terrified , in particular , not of what will happen to him but that he will not be able to provide financially for his family and others			0
that is a genuine concern he has expressed to me			0
' he continued : ' these proceedings have had a quite massive impact on mr @entity149 and the court would be entitled to conclude that he has learned a very important lesson indeed and he has shown real insight into the impact on his victims of his behaviour that night			0
' relieved : the singer broke down in tears and shouted ' yes ' as he found out he would not be jailed pleading : @entity2 's lawyer said if he was jailed his career as a rapper would be over @entity2 , pictured left with his @entity3 bandmates @entity176 and @entity177 , said he has already been punished because he ca n't go to @entity58 to work due to his conviction praying as the verdict was announced , @entity2 , wearing a white shirt and black tie , broke down in tears and shouted ' yes ' as judge @entity51 announced that the prison term would be suspended			1

he said : ' the report i have on you suggests you do not present overtly criminal attitudes and this offence has been a wake - up call for you			0
' he added : ' spitting at someone is a repulsive action and is more serious because you have done something similar in the past			0
' even on that aggravation , the offence would not be so serious as to merit a prison sentence			1
' it is clear that this spitting triggered these events that culminated in the affray but was not part of the affray			2
' the judge added : ' the sentence i have decided on is not affected by any consideration of whether a person is well - known to the public			2
' witnesses : the fight was sparked after @entity13 , right , and @entity14 , left , refused @entity2 's advances at a petrol station in @entity32 brawl : the victims were left with facial injuries including missing teeth and a broken nose after the fight @entity25 , 25 , of @entity226 , west @entity227 , was also found guilty at trial of affray and was jailed for 14 months , ordered to pay £ 1,500 compensation and £ 500 costs			1

' he is a popular rapper who commands a large following and as a high profile musician in the public eye , it is important that the public see that there are consequences for anyone who demonstrates this type of aggressive behaviour and the sentencing today follows a robust investigation to find those responsible and bring them to justice			0
' @entity292 from the @entity293 , said : ' this case involved a violent attack on three young men on a night out , who were admirably attempting to protect two girls they had just met			0
