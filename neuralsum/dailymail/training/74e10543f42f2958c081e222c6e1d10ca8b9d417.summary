by @entity1 reporter published : 01:56 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 01:56 est , 5 march 2014 despite having reputations for wild parties , excessive drinking and allegedly hazing junior members , new research shows that members of @entity10 organizations on college campuses are more likely to graduate on time than their @entity14 counterparts			1
additionally , the study found , membership in a sorority has no effect on a woman 's gpa			0
however , the same can not be said for men in fraternities - according to the study , published in the @entity24 , finds that fraternity men have lower gpas than those not in @entity10 life			0
the gpas for men in fraternities , the study 's authors - p. @entity31 of @entity32 and @entity33 of @entity34 - conclude , is ' only very slightly ' lower than their @entity14 , male counterparts			0
' seven years of college down the drain ! ' not quite - study finds @entity10 students are more likely to graduate in four years ' @entity10 membership is found to increase the desire to pursue a graduate degree , and increase the likelihood of graduating on time , ' the authors write in the report			1
they add that ' four - year graduation rates are notably higher for @entity10 members , with male and female members being 4.8 and 4.7 percentage points more likely to do so , respectively ( compared to non-members )			0
' the study is based on a survey of more than 103,000 students at 463 colleges and universities across the @entity60 of the respondents , 19 percent reported that they were a member of a fraternity or sorority			0
the surveys were given to students in both their freshman and senior years			0

more drinking , however , had little bearing on how students performed academically - which may be the result of academic requirements @entity10 organizations place on their members			1
drink up : members of @entity10 organizations are morel likely to drink more frequently than @entity14 students ' the increased likelihoods of graduating on time may stem from @entity10 members having an added incentive to stay enrolled and keep a minimum @entity117 , so that they can continue to belong to the organization , ' the study finds			1
additionally , members of both sororities and fraternities are more likely to be involved in student government than other students , and participate in volunteer activities more often than @entity14 students .			0

women in sororities actually perform better academically than @entity14 women
study authors *suggest* academic requirements placed on members of @entity10 organizations could be the reason they perform well academically
