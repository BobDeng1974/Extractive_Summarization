a map of the @entity1 , released by @entity2 last year , revealed something fishy going on off the coast of @entity5			1
around 300 miles offshore , a city of lights was appearing in the middle of the @entity9			2
the strange lights were perplexing as there are no humans , fires or gas wells in that region			1
a global composite map of @entity1 's night lights revealed human activity well offshore from @entity19 what is there however , according to @entity2 , are fishing boats with lights powerful enough to be seen in space			1
the lights were spotted using @entity26 on the @entity28 satellite			1
according to @entity2 , the night fishermen are hunting for @entity30 , a species of short - finned squid			1
the squid are found tens to hundreds of kilometres offshore from roughly @entity33 to @entity34			2
the offshore illumination comes from arrays of green led lights used to attract squid to the sea surface illex argentinus are a species of short - finned squid			1
they are found tens to hundreds of kilometres offshore from roughly @entity33 to @entity34			0
they live 80 to 600 meters below the surface , feeding on shrimp , crabs , and fish			2
lights cause the squids food to be attracted to the surface of the ocean this , in turn , this attracts the squid to the surface where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines			1
scientists first noted such night - lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of the @entity1 at night			0
they live 80 to 600 meters below the surface , feeding on shrimp , crabs , and fish			0
‘ in turn , @entity65 are consumed by larger finfish , whales , seals , sea birds , penguins ... and humans , ’ said @entity2			1
scientists first noted such night - lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of the @entity1 at night			0
‘ @entity78 aggregate in high concentrations at the shelfbreak because it is a very productive area during austral spring and summer , ’ explained @entity75 , a biological oceanographer with @entity5 ’s @entity76			0
at the shelfbreak front , microscopic plant - like organisms explode in population in various seasons			0
this ‘ grass of the sea ’ feeds zooplankton and fish , which then become food for @entity30 and other marine creatures			0
the map shows the distribution of chlorophyll in march 2012 along the coast of @entity19			0
the amount of chlorophyll is a measure of how much phytoplankton is growing near the surface			0
brighter whites and yellows show the areas with the highest concentrations ; blues and green have low concentrations to draw the plankton and fish that the squid eat to the surface , fishermen use powerful lights , generating as much as 300 kilowatts per boat			1
@entity78 follow their prey toward the surface , where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines			2
for many squid , the zooplankton and fish they follow is the last meal they will eat			2
in the @entity9 , @entity5 and @entity123 citizens have exclusive rights to fish out to 200 miles			2
as the map suggests , ships from other nations work as close to that border as they can to get a share of the squid fishing			0

in this image taken from space , over the course of nine nights , fishing boats shift positions while hugging the borders of the exclusive economic zones of @entity5 and the @entity123			1

the lights shone in a region were there are no humans , fires or gas wells
@entity2 says they are caused by fishermen using @entity153 lights to catch squid
satellite maps show how the boats hug the borders of the exclusive economic zones where they are *allowed* to fish
