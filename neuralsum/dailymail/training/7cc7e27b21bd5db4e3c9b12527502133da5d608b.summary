as the resident builder on the tv garden makeover show @entity0 , the pressure on @entity2 was to complete an amazing transformation in record time			1
so it 's rather ironic that the first property development he embarked upon with his own cash took him a decade to complete			1
@entity10 is now selling the three - bedroom house , which he rebuilt from a dilapidated shell , for £ 299,950			1
the project , ten minutes from @entity15 in the town of @entity17 , @entity18 , took him so long because he was offered his life - changing role on @entity0 in 1997 - just after he bought the building			1
@entity2 at his property at @entity23 in @entity18 in its prime , the hit @entity25 show drew audiences of 12 million			1
@entity10 , then a successful self - employed builder , was catapulted to fame alongside the original team of @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity10 paid £ 29,000 for the near derelict building - which was originally used as a school within a @entity36 workhouse complex			1
the workhouse was designed by renowned architect sir @entity38 , who later created the iconic frontage at @entity40			0
@entity10 's building had stood empty for 20 years after a botched attempt to convert it into a home			2
he bought it directly from a bank after it was repossessed			0
' it had failed to sell at auction and was completely uninhabitable , ' he explains			0
he had plans to turn it into a three - bedroom weekend retreat for his family , with the help of his father , @entity58 , also a builder and a manufacturer of building materials			1
@entity32 , @entity31 and @entity2 of @entity0 ' @entity62 is in my blood			2
i was working with my dad on a saturday from the age of four , ' @entity10 , 57 , says			2
applying for planning permission took more than two years because of the building 's @entity69 listed status			0
' my dad and i used to come here in the winter months when filming was over , ' says @entity10 , pointing to photos which show his old @entity0 truck parked outside the building site			1
other snaps show @entity10 's sidekick from the show , @entity79 , helping to install the spiral staircase which leads down to the basement , where they added a third bedroom			1
it was a massive project - three - quarters of the building had to be completely rebuilt including the roof , chimney - stack and external walls			0
@entity10 and his father painstakingly recreated original features such as the distinctive diamond pattern brickwork , cast iron windows and copings on the edge of the roof			2
' the planners told me it was an improvement on the original design , which is something i 'd like written on my headstone , ' he says proudly			0
sadly @entity10 's father never got to see him complete the project as he died in 1999 at the age of 77			2
once the house was complete , @entity10 found his three children , now in their 20s , preferred to be at the family home in @entity109 , @entity110 , at weekends			1
so he let the property for seven years			0
he is selling now because , as a landlord , he prefers his rental properties to be closer to his @entity109 house			0
despite his fame , @entity10 remains grounded			2
' i still live in @entity109 , where i was born and bred , ' he says			0
' family life is important to me and simple pleasures like football and the odd beer			0
i 'm not particularly extravagant			0
' @entity2 's house at @entity17 during rebuilding his home is a stunning four - storey , four - bedroom @entity36 property that he did up himself			1
but he talks with disbelief about his nearby childhood home , bought by his father for £ 1,200 in 1956 , which sold for £ 1.2 million three years ago : ' it 's now worth nearer £ 3 million			2
it 's a shame because it means @entity109 is now too expensive for a lot of the original inhabitants			0
everyone deserves a right to expect a roof over their head			0
' @entity0 finished in 2005 and @entity10 went on to appear in several other property shows , although none ever quite as popular			1
he continues to run his building business and is currently renovating two houses in @entity109 , which he will let out			0
once he sells in @entity17 , he has his eye on a flat , again in @entity110 , overlooking the @entity146 in @entity147			0
he plans to improve and extend it			0
according to @entity150 at selling agents @entity151 , prices in @entity18 are increasing at a gentler rate than the current boom in the @entity110 market - and are still about five per cent below 2008 levels			1
@entity157 @entity10 is now selling the three - bedroom house , which he rebuilt from a dilapidated shell , for £ 299,950			1

@entity10 paid £ 29,000 for the three - bedroom house , now worth £ 299,950
