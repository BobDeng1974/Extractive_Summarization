by @entity0 one in five @entity2 will be from an ethnic minority by 2050 , state - sponsored research predicted yesterday			2
the development of minority groups will outpace the increase in numbers of those who describe themselves as ' white @entity2 ' , the report said			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and other minority groups will move from cities to affluent suburbs as they grow in prosperity and status , the report predicts			1
diverse : members of the @entity22 community in @entity23 , in @entity24			0
researchers say by 2050 , one in five @entity2 will be from an ethnic minority white people from elsewhere in the world - notably from @entity29 , but also from @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 - will be the fastest growing section of society			1
the scale of the minority population in 2051 will be two - and - a - half times the minority share of the population at the beginning of the century , the findings said			2
they put the ethnic minority share of the population in 2001 at eight per cent			0
increases on the scale predicted in the report by academics from @entity48 mean the non-white ethnic minority population , which numbered under five million in 2001 , will be more than three times bigger in 2051 , at 15.6 million of a projected total @entity2 population of 78 million			1
the report , sponsored by the government 's @entity53 , comes in the wake of national census figures which said the non-white ethnic minority share of the population last year was 14 per cent			1
according to the census findings , 86 per cent of the population count themselves as white and 80 per cent as ' white @entity2 ' the ' white @entity2 ' population has dropped to 45 per cent , fewer than half , in @entity24 , the census said			0
the report was by academics from @entity48 and sponsored by the government 's @entity53 however the ethnic minority population will spread out over coming decades as families who arrived in @entity24 looking for work become successful and follow the middle - class flight from the city to outer towns and suburbs where there are better schools and transport and less crime			1
report author professor @entity77 said : ' at a regional level , the ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to the suburbs and surrounding towns			1
' this echoes the way that white groups have migrated in the past with the growth of the middle classes			1
in particular the black and @entity12 populations of affluent local authorities will increase significantly			2
' the increase in the ' other white ' population will be mainly a result of immigration from @entity29 , professor @entity77 said			0
' one of the most surprising findings was the scale of increase in the so - called other ethnic groups representing people from lots of other countries outside of the main origin groups			2
' report author large - scale migration from @entity29 has been under way since 2004 , when @entity107 and seven other @entity29 countries joined the @entity109 , and the @entity110 predicted 13,000 workers would come to @entity2 as a result			0
more than a million eastern @entity113 have since arrived in @entity2 to work , and there are more than half a million @entity29 in the population			0
other @entity29 countries are also sending greater numbers of migrants			0
young @entity120 men and women are now arriving in @entity24 in numbers to take advantage of work opportunities and lower tax rates than they can find at home			0
apart from @entity130 whites , the other fastest growing group in the population will be minority groups from countries other than those in @entity132 and @entity133 which have long sent migrants to @entity2			1
professor @entity77 said : ' one of the most surprising findings was the scale of increase in the so - called other ethnic groups representing people from lots of other countries outside of the main origin groups			2
' the 78 million prediction for the overall population made by the report means that academics believe the country is bound to exceed the 70 million population point considered by many analysts to be likely to overstretch housing , transport , water , power and education resources			0
@entity157 projections suggest that the 70 million population will be reached in 14 to 15 years ' time .			0

report predicts white people from *abroad* will grow fastest as a group
@entity11 , @entity12 and other minority groups move from cities to suburbs
