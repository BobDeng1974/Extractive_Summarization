ms @entity0 was taken to @entity38 where doctors battled in vain to save her the mitral valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber , and helps control blood flow through the heart			1
during each heartbeat the smaller upper chambers of the heart contract to push blood into the larger lower chambers			2
the mitral valve opens to allow this passage of blood from the left atrium , and closes when the left ventricle is full of blood , to prevent backflow			0
when the valve closes , its two leaflets ( flaps ) normally seal the valve shut			0
tendons attached to these flaps keep them taut and prevent them collapsing through to the other side			0
problems with the mitral valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body			2
severe problems can lead to heart failure - which is where the heart can no longer pump enough blood around the body if the valve is not surgically repaired or replaced			2
there are three main types of problem : - @entity123 regurgitation ( also called ' mitral incompetence ' ) – where there is a backflow of blood through the valve , often as a result of a problem called mitral valve prolapse - @entity123 stenosis – where the valve does n't open as wide as it should , restricting blood flow - mitral valve prolapse - where one or more of the mitral flaps are floppy and do n't close tightly , often leading to backflow of blood these conditions can each occur alone or in combination			0
