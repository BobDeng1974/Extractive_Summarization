at night we tried to strangle ourselves			0
' two girls who were held with us woke up and stopped us and then stayed awake to watch over us			2
' when they fell asleep at 5am we tried again , and again they woke up and stopped us			0
i could not speak for several days after that			0
' the shocking account has been revealed in a new report by @entity31 that has found @entity1 girls as young as 12 are being raped , sold and forced into marriage by their captors			1
many girls will attempt to commit suicide in order to escape the horrendous conditions they are kept in , according to the charity , with terrorists threatening to kill their families if they take their own life			1
a 20 - year - old woman named @entity45 recalled how another woman named @entity47 killed herself after fearing she was about to be forced into a marriage @entity45 said : ' we were 21 girls in one room , two of them were very young , 10 - 12 years old			1
' one day we were given clothes that looked like dance costumes and were told to bathe and wear those clothes			0
@entity47 killed herself in the bathroom			0
' she cut her wrists and hanged herself			0
i think she knew that she was going to be taken away by a man and that is why she killed herself			0
' @entity2 fighters seized thousands of @entity1 prisoners on august 3 this year after their ancestral home , the town of @entity10 , was overrun			1
the terrorists then began a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the @entity1 , who they believe to be devil - worshippers			1
around 7,000 @entity1 women were captured by @entity2 in august after their ancestral home of @entity10 was overrun by fighters , and have since been sold into slavery or forced into marriage ( file image ) according to @entity78 figures around 5,000 men were gathered together and executed , while 7,000 women were taken and sold as slaves , forced into marriage , and raped			1

@entity87 , 18 , recalled being given to a 30 - year - old man from @entity89 , in north - west @entity90			0
she said : ' his family did not agree with what [ @entity2 ] did to the @entity1 girls but did not do anything to stop it			1
i was put in a room with his wife , she was also from @entity89 , was young and very nice to me			2
' she has two young children , a boy and a girl , with him			2
his parents did not interfere , but they said that if i did not convert to @entity103 he should give me away or sell me , and get a @entity105 wife instead			0
' another recalled the husband 's wife crying in sympathy with her over the way she had been treated , but saying that she was powerless to help			0
according to research by @entity31 , girls as young as 12 have been raped , while some as young as 10 have been traded or sold as slaves , while many were beaten unconscious for resisting ( file image ) despite living by a strict religious code , @entity103 state fighters are allowed to take and have sex with @entity1 women because they view them as little more than property to be used			1
according to an online question and answer believed to have been posted by @entity125 officials , a man may have sex with a @entity1 virgin ' immediately after taking possession of her ' , but if she is not a virgin ' her uterus must be purified first ' - though it does not explain what this entails			2

former public schoolgirl @entity141 , 20 , from @entity142 , is known to have been in @entity140 helping to organise religious patrols , while @entity145 twins @entity144 and @entity146 , 16 , are also thought to have been there			0
since @entity10 was overrun in august , around 300 @entity1 women have managed to escape captivity			1
@entity31 spoke with 42 of them , and managed to call four who are still being held by @entity2			2
among that group accounts of beatings were common , often after girls tried to resist being handed over to @entity2 fighters as slaves or wives			1
several anonymous accounts detail women being beaten unconscious by the men , who were mostly @entity90 or @entity160 , before being dragged away by their hair			2
one girl named @entity163 , 15 , said she was taken along with her 13 - year - old cousin to a village near @entity10 , where she was captured , before being given to an @entity90 man			1
she said : ' we were held in a house with five other girls			2
there they did to me what they did to many other girls			2
' my cousin was not molested ; they wanted to take her to marry her to a man but in the end they left her with us and then we managed to escape			0
previous reports suggested @entity136 jihadis were helping run brothels for @entity2 filled with @entity1 women in @entity140 , a city where @entity187 ( pictured ) is known to have gone ' the men were all @entity90			1
they said that if we killed ourselves they would kill our relatives			0
' despite being free from her captors , 61 of @entity163 's relatives are still in the hands of @entity2 , while it is not known whether many of them are alive or dead			2
a spokesman for @entity31 said : ' despite worldwide condemnation , the @entity199 has shown no intention of putting an end to the war crimes and crimes against humanity which its fighters have been committing on a large scale , including against the @entity90 women and girls they have abducted and continue to hold captive			1
' any party , in @entity90 or outside , with any influence over the @entity199 should use that influence to secure the release of these captives			0
' a small proportion of those abducted have managed to escape is captivity , many after having been subjected to acts of unspeakable brutality			0
' but the survivors interviewed by @entity31 are not receiving the help and support they desperately need			0
' meanwhile , extremists are said to be working to excise women from public life across the @entity2 controlled territory			1
in day - to - day life , the group has also dramatically hemmed in women 's lives across the @entity105 heartland that makes up the bulk of @entity125 group territory , activists and residents say			2
in @entity89 , @entity90 , the biggest city in the group 's self - declared caliphate , ' life for women has taken a 180 - degree turn ' , according to @entity243 , a prominent @entity90 human rights activist			2
she added : ' they are forbidding them from learning , forbidding them from moving around freely			0
the appearance of a woman is being forcefully altered			0
' at least 10 women in @entity89 have been killed for speaking out against the group , ms @entity243 said			0

relatives of women considered improperly dressed or found in the company of males who are not relatives are lashed or imprisoned			0
in the @entity2 - controlled town of @entity263 in @entity160 's northern @entity265 province , an activist described seeing armed militants walking with a stick in hand , gently whacking or jabbing at women deemed inappropriately dressed			1
@entity270 , who is now based in @entity271 explained : ' sometimes they follow the woman home and detain her father , or they confiscate her @entity277 and tell her to come back with her father to pick it up			0
' enforcement varies from one place to the other , much of it depending on the whims of the @entity284 , or vice police enforcing those rules			0
despite living to a strict religious code , @entity2 fighters are permitted to trade and have sex with @entity1 women as they view them as property to be used most of the areas taken over by @entity2 were already deeply conservative places where women had a subordinate role in society , but the extremists have sharply exacerbated the restrictions			1
an @entity2 all - female brigade , called @entity302 , patrols the streets in some areas to enforce clothing restrictions			2
meanwhile in the @entity90 city of @entity308 , an elementary school teacher said militants recently dropped by the school to deliver the niqab , robes and gloves for the students to wear			0
they have also segregated schools and changed the curriculum and in some cases shut schools down as they were not teaching a hard - line version of @entity321 law			0
hospitalas have also been segregrated , with women only allowed to be seen by female doctors , but there are very few of them left			0
while early marriage is also on the rise because parents want to find husbands for their daughters quickly for fear they will be forced to marry @entity2 fighters			1
last month , a @entity78 panel said : ' the psychological and physical harm caused by @entity2 's treatment of women , the onerous instructions imposed on their dress code , and restrictions on their freedom of movement demonstrate discriminatory treatment on the basis of gender			1

girls as young as 12 forced into marriage , raped , and beaten for resisting
others sold to fighters who took them home to live with their wives
