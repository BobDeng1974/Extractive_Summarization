a study has revealed that up to ten million gallons of ‘ missing oil ’ from the 2010 @entity3 disaster has been discovered at the bottom of the @entity5			1
the explosion at @entity3 's @entity8 rig killed 11 workers , injured 17 more and caused nearly 50,000 barrels of oil per day to spew into the gulf			1
now a study has revealed that a huge deposit of the oil , the whereabouts of which had eluded the @entity19 government , is sitting on the sea bed			1
it is feared the discovery heralds long - term bad news for the environment in the area			0
the findings were revealed after a study carried out by oceanography experts at @entity36			1
@entity37 quotes the study ’s lead researcher , @entity38 , as saying : ‘ this is going to affect the @entity5 for years to come			1
‘ fish will likely ingest contaminants because worms ingest the sediment , and fish eat the worms			2
it 's a conduit for contamination into the food web			0
’ the website reports that researchers extracted 62 sediment samples from an area surrounding the @entity8 site covering 9,266 sq miles			1
the explosion at @entity3 's @entity8 rig killed 11 workers , injured 17 more and caused nearly 50,000 barrels of oil per day to spew into the gulf the well went unplugged for nearly three months after the explosion on april 20 , 2010 , damaging fishing and tourism as well as marine and wildlife habitats samples without the radioactive isotope carbon - 14 show that oil is present			1
the information gathered was then used to create a map of the areas affected			0
@entity37 says researchers found that an area of about 3,243 sq miles was covered with oil from the disaster			1
it is not yet clear how the crude deposits descended to the sea bed but one theory is that oil particles may have clumped together			0
this could have happened at the water 's surface or in the plumes from the underwater leak , the researchers said			0
another theory is that ash and black carbon created when cleanup crews were burning patches of oil may have sunk			0
the well went unplugged for nearly three months after the explosion on april 20 , 2010 , damaging fishing and tourism as well as marine and wildlife habitats			0
@entity3 has questioned the researchers ’ methods for calculating carbon derived from oil claiming ‘ their estimates of the amount deposited on the sea floor are not supported by the data in their paper			0
’ a spokesman said : ‘ instead of using rigorous chemical analysis to identify oil in sediments , the authors used a tracer common to all sources of oil , including oil from the @entity5 ’s numerous natural seeps			2
‘ further , only three of their 62 sediment samples had evidence of excess petrocarbon when compared to pre-spill sediment samples			2
’ the spokesman added that government experts had found that one per cent of sediment samples taken after august 3 , 2010 ‘ exceeded @entity129 aquatic life benchmarks for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and only those within 3 kilometers of the wellhead were consistent with @entity134 oil			2

explosion at @entity8 killed 11 workers and injured 17 others
caused nearly 50,000 barrels of oil per day to spew into @entity5
deposit of up to ten million gallons considered ' missing ' has been found
study finds it 's buried in sediment 62 miles southeast of @entity32
research was carried out by oceanographers at @entity36
