by @entity0 published : 20:30 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 08:08 est , 23 december 2012 the @entity2 's acting director has sent out a scathing public deploration of film @entity4 to his entire staff after watching what he calls entertaining historical inaccuracies in its portrayal of the raid of @entity13 's compound			1
billed as ' the story of history 's greatest manhunt for the world 's most dangerous man ' by using firsthand accounts , the film recounts @entity23 troops ' top secret mission while highlighting the first hours of may 1st of 2011			1
' i would not normally comment on a @entity27 film , but i think it 's important to put @entity4 which deals with one of the most significant achievements in our history , into some context , ' @entity24 began in his note to his staff on friday			1
scroll down to read the full statement @entity27 portrayal : actress @entity38 is seen in a scene from new film @entity4 which has been most recently criticized by acting @entity2 director @entity24 for historical inaccuracies not a fan : acting cia director @entity43 lambasted the film in a public statement to his employees on friday claiming it does n't fairly portray what really happened in 2011 or the decade of work beforehand mr @entity24 accuses the film as being overwhelmingly misleading in its timeline , depiction of @entity2 personnel and their actions , as well as its shown use of torture to generate information			1
' what i want you to know is that @entity4 is a dramatization , not a realistic portrayal of the facts , ' he begins			0
among three points , mr @entity24 argues the hunt for @entity13 having been a group effort of hundreds of officers over a decade , contrasting the @entity27 film attributing it to , as he writes , ' just a few individuals			1
' in the film written by screenwriter @entity73 , the mission ’s leading intelligence operative is played by @entity38 who is largely credited in the film for finding @entity13 ’s secret compound in @entity76 , @entity77			1
' this may make for more compelling entertainment , but it does not reflect the facts , ' he writes			0
' second , ' he begins , ' the film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding @entity13			2
' he argues multiple sources outside of a primary use of ' enhanced interrogation ' - the @entity2 's popular chosen description of torture - in finding @entity13			2
hot and cold : the film , one scene pictured , has since been nominated for four @entity99 despite mutually searing criticism from @entity101 ' some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques , but there were many other sources as well , ' he wrote			2
' third , the film takes considerable liberties in its depiction of @entity2 personnel and their actions , including some who died while serving our country			1
we can not allow a @entity27 film to cloud our memory of them , ' he concluded			2
‘ @entity2 interacted with the filmmakers through our @entity120 but , as is true with any entertainment project with which we interact , we do not control the final product			0
' the film that ’s currently playing in select theatres before its full release in january has been since nominated for four @entity99			2
but critics arguing its factuality , like mr @entity24 , have come from the nation ’s top politicians as well			1
last week senators @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 wrote a letter to @entity136 chairman and ceo @entity137 accusing it as being ' factually inaccurate			0
' the three asked for a disclaimer before the film on its accuracies , contrasting its current reading : ‘ based on firsthand accounts of actual events			2
’ criticisms : among mr @entity24 's complaints of the film , pictured , are its depiction of torture used by @entity23 troops to gain information and the mission 's credit given to a select number of people like mr @entity24 , they also target the film 's shown use of torture			1
' @entity4 is factually inaccurate , and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for @entity13 is not based on the facts , but rather part of the film 's fictional narrative , ' they wrote			1
@entity131 is chairwoman of the @entity170 , the group who will oversee president @entity173 's selection of @entity2 director which @entity24 is considered a top candidate for			1
earlier this month the film 's screenwriter @entity73 defended his work to the @entity179 , expressing the complexity in cramming such a timeline of events into a film of approximately two and a half hours			0
' i ’m trying to compress a program that lasted for years into a few short scenes , ' he said , adding that it also aims ' to reflect a very complex debate about torture that is still going on			0
' mr @entity73 and director @entity191 have previously defended it as a film not intended to withstand nit - picking historians			1
statement to @entity196 from acting director @entity43 : " @entity4 " december 21 , 2012 i would not normally comment on a @entity27 film , but i think it important to put @entity4 , which deals with one of the most significant achievements in our history , into some context			1
the film , which premiered this week , addresses the successful hunt for @entity13 that was the focus of incredibly dedicated men and women across our @entity209 , @entity211 , and military partners for many years			0
but in doing so , the film takes significant artistic license , while portraying itself as being historically accurate			0
what i want you to know is that @entity4 is a dramatization , not a realistic portrayal of the facts			0
@entity2 interacted with the filmmakers through our @entity120 but , as is true with any entertainment project with which we interact , we do not control the final product			0
it would not be practical for me to walk through all the fiction in the film , but let me highlight a few aspects that particularly underscore the extent to which the film departs from reality			0
commentators will have much to say about this film in the weeks ahead			0
through it all , i want you to remember that @entity4 is not a documentary			0
what you should also remember is that the @entity13 operation was a landmark achievement by our country , by our military , by our @entity211 , and by our @entity209			0

acting cia director @entity24 lambasted the film for its *meager* credit to his entire team , its depicted use of torture as well as of his staff and their actions
