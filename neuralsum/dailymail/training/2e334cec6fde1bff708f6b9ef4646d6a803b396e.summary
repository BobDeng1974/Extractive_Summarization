the families of two babies who spent the first 10 years of their lives with the wrong mothers after they were mistakenly switched at birth are suing the @entity6 maternity clinic responsible for nearly £ 10million			1
the blunder occurred 20 years ago when @entity8 - now 38 - and another unnamed mother gave birth to daughters at a clinic in the @entity14 resort of @entity15 , near @entity16			1
mrs @entity8 's baby girl @entity17 suffered from jaundice and doctors put her in an incubator equipped with lights to treat the problem along with another affected newborn girl			1
she and another unnamed mother who gave birth to @entity17 and was handed mrs @entity8 's biological daughter in the blunder are suing the clinic for £ 10m an auxiliary nurse unwittingly switched them , and although both mothers immediately expressed doubt about the babies , pointing to their different hair lengths , they were sent home anyway			1
ten years later , troubled by the fact his daughter bore no resemblance to him with her darker skin , @entity17 's father did a paternity test that revealed he was not her biological parent			1
@entity8 then discovered she was not @entity17 's mother either , prompting a probe to try and find the other family who had been handed their biological daughter			1
when they were located , it transpired that the daughters had grown up just 18 miles apart			0
the other family involved in the case also attended tuesday 's closed - doors hearing , but opted to remain anonymous			0
emotional : @entity61 wipes away tears as she speaks to media outside court after the damages hearing the investigation revealed that at the time of the births in 1994 , three newborns suffered from jaundice - the two girls and a boy - and the clinic only had two incubators with the special lights			2
the girls were therefore put together in one incubator , according to the lawyer of one of the obstetricians being sued			0
another obstetrician , two paediatricians , the clinic and an auxiliary nurse are also being sued			1
' if it happened to us , it may have happened to others , ' @entity8 said after the hearing , holding the hand of her non-biological daughter @entity17			2
' there should be exemplary sentences ...			0
we really hope to get this recognition , so as to free us from all this guilt about not having been able to protect your kid , not having insisted when we saw there was a problem			0
' @entity61 ( right ) and her mother @entity8 embrace a relative as they leave @entity16 courthouse for her part , @entity17 said she was shocked over accusations levelled in court blaming the mothers for not having recognised their children			1
' she protested , she found herself in front of a qualified nurse , she was very young , she had just had a child , so putting the blame on her is absurd , i find that inhuman , ' she said			0
the two sets of parents met their biological daughters for the first time when they were both 10 years old , but did not ask that they be switched back			1
' it was a pretty disturbing moment , very bizarre , ' said @entity17			2
' you find yourself in front of a woman who is biologically your mother but who is a stranger			0
' the two families have distanced themselves from each other since the meeting 10 years ago			0
it 's too difficult , so we each went our separate ways as it 's so distressing , it was the only way to find some stability again , ' said @entity8			0
the court will rule on the case on february 10			0
the clinic has admitted fault - blaming what happened on the nursing auxiliary whom it claims suffered from alcoholism - but has insisted it will not pay any damages .			2
