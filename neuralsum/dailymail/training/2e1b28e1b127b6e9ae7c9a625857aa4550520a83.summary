' you know , i 'm not going to be here and try to sum up what this place has meant to be mover the years			0
i could n't ' do that			0
we got plenty of time			0
' getting emotional he then said ; ' what is this fluid ? what are these feelings ? frankenstein angry ! ' he closed by saying ; ' it 's been an absolute privilege			0
it 's been the honor of my professional life , and i thank you for watching it			0
whatever reason you were tuning in for			0
' ' for the better part of the last two decades , i have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with @entity0			1
his comedic brilliance is second to none , ' @entity64 , president of @entity5 , said in a statement			1
' @entity0 has been at the heart of @entity5 , championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry , in front of and behind the camera			1
through his unique voice and vision , ‘ @entity2 ’ has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come			1
' ' @entity0 will remain at the helm of @entity2 ’ until later this year , ' she added			1
' he is a comic genius , generous with his time and talent , and will always be a part of the @entity5 family			2
' @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 ( right ) are just two of the a-list names who worked on @entity2 @entity91 ( above ) left the show to host his own program on @entity5 , @entity94 under @entity0 , the show has won 18 emmys , taking home the award for @entity99 every year from 2003 to 2012			1
it also won two @entity101 , for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004			0
the show has had two shows spin - off the program , @entity94 with @entity91 and the recently debuted @entity106 with @entity107			2
another former corespondent , @entity108 , also hosts a similar news program on @entity110 , @entity111 , which premiered last year			1
the show has also been the launching pad for many now a-list stars , including @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity88 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity87 , who went on to star in @entity120 and was just nominated for an @entity121 for his role in @entity123			0
@entity0 , 52 , had hinted at his possible departure from this show starting late last year in interviews while promoting his directorial debut @entity128			1
' when do you decide that even though it 's this place of great comfort and you feel like you 're plugged into it like you 've never been plugged into anything else that you 've ever done , you know ... there are other considerations of family or even in the sense of just not wanting to be on television all the time ' he told @entity141 in an @entity143 interview			0
' you know , you ca n't just stay in the same place because it feels like you 've built a nice house there			0
and that 's really the thing that i struggle with			0
and it is unclear to me			0
' he also tole the @entity155 reporter when asked if he still enjoyed doing the show ; ' uh , yeah			0
i mean , like anything else , you do it long enough , you will take it for granted , or there will be aspects of it that are grinding			0
i ca n't say that following the news cycle as closely as we do and trying to convert that into something either joyful or important to us does n't have its fraught moments			2
but there will come a point where i 'm sure			0
' @entity0 released his directorial debut @entity128 last year , and is seen with lead actor @entity172 this as his contract , with a reported salary in the $ 25million to $ 35million range per year , is set to expire			1
there had also been talk of @entity0 leaving when it was reported he was offered the hosting job on @entity181 's @entity180 , something @entity0 confirmed but a position he said he would never take			1
no doubt making this loss even more difficult for @entity5 is that it comes on the heels of @entity91 leaving his program to take over for the departing @entity188 on @entity190 's @entity189			1
almost immediately after the announcement was made , celebrities took to @entity193 to pay tribute to @entity0 's work on the show and state how upset they were to see him leaving			1

# @entity209 ca n't wait to see what 's next ! ' @entity211 also weighed in ; ' @entity0 quitting ? good timing			2
he was beginning to be eclipsed by @entity108			0
this way , he can leave on a high			2
' @entity215 , who recently left his late night program , said ; ' congratulations to @entity0 on an extraordinary groundbreaking run			1
' transparent actor and togetherness creator @entity219 wrote ; ' what will we do without you , @entity0 , oh captain our captain ? ' ' @entity225 is rigged for the big guys - and no person has more consistently called them out for it than @entity0			2
