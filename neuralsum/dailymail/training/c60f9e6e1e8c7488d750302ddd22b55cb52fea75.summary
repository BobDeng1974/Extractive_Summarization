former @entity1 boss @entity0 has told the current @entity3 team to copy the example set by @entity5 and @entity6 as they set out to stun @entity8			1
@entity11 's @entity10 side are as long as 6 - 1 with the bookmakers ahead of next sunday 's @entity14 semi-final clash			1
it is doubtful the odds have ever been stacked so high against one side going into an @entity19 encounter			2
ex-rangers manager @entity0 believes his old side can beat @entity8 in the @entity14 semi-final but @entity0 insists the @entity22 can topple their fiercest rivals and urged them to use the same self - belief which helped both the @entity25 and @entity6 inflict their respective shock @entity27 upsets on @entity28 and @entity29 at the weekend			1
the @entity31 boss - who won eight of the 20 @entity19 games he bossed between 2001 and 2006 - said : ' normally @entity8 should win because of the difference in quality			1
but it 's a cup tie and an @entity19			0
@entity1 will probably raise their game big time			1
' we 've seen the big @entity27 upsets in @entity40 over the weekend			2
there is no reason why @entity1 ca n't do that			2
' you have to believe			0
there is no point going out onto the pitch thinking : ' i 'm intimidated			0
i 'm overawed by this			0
' ' you have to go there and give everything - perhaps even a couple of per cent that is n't in your make - up consistently			2
' for this game , i 'd like to think they will step up			0
if @entity1 get everything right tactically , they can upset @entity8			1
' @entity57 ( front ) scored @entity5 's fourth in a memorable 4 - 2 win at @entity28 in the @entity27 @entity6 players celebrate with their travelling supporters after beating @entity29 on saturday and @entity0 believes old - stagers like @entity64 and @entity65 will be vital to the @entity3 cause as they take on the @entity67 at @entity68			1
seven of the current @entity69 , @entity65 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 - have tasted @entity19 action before , just one fewer than @entity8 can boast			1
' the important players for @entity1 next week are going to be the experienced players , ' said former @entity79 boss @entity0 , who was back at @entity3 on sunday as he managed a team of retired @entity1 players in @entity83 's charity match			2
' those lads will be key			0
they could be the catalyst for an upset			0
' because it is @entity1 , we all think they should still be able to beat @entity8			1
but you have to be realistic			0
' at the same time , it 's a great chance for these boys to get their names in the history books			0
' @entity0 says @entity65 ( left ) and @entity71 's ( right ) previous experiences in @entity19 games will be vital			0

@entity8 host @entity1 in the @entity14 semi-final
@entity100 won 4 - 2 at @entity28 in the @entity27 fourth round
@entity103 champions @entity29 lost 2 - 0 to @entity6
