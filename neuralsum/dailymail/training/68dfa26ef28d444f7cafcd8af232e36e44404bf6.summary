@entity1 's drive - thru brothels have been hailed a success by @entity4 social services , a year after they first opened			1
the experiment in @entity4 's largest city began last august when the authorities opened @entity9 's first municipal drive - in brothel in an old industrial area			2
it was hoped the initiative would slash the number of sex workers on the streets , while at the same time offering them a safer space to work			2
but not all of them are happy with the arrangements			0
scroll down foe video privacy ... two empty so - called ' sex boxes ' at @entity1 's sex drive - in , which has been hailed a success by @entity4 social services one year after it first opened in an industrial site in the west of the city a prostitute looks at the facilities : sex workers agreeing to take part in the scheme have to get a permit and pay tax to avail of the drive - in 's creature comforts , which include a laundry , showers and cafe authorities admitted that some have complained their earnings have fallen since the new initiative began , and that they are too far from city centre bars and clubs			1
running the drive - in , which cost around 2million euros ( $ 2.6 million ; Â£ 1.6million ) to set up , has also proved more costly than originally thought			0
@entity1 's drive - thru brothel opened last august , with sex workers who agreed to move from their traditional haunts in the city centre allowed to ply their trade there safely and with a minimum of fuss			1
the site to the west of the city boasts helpful signposts and understated wooden drive - in ' sex boxes ' where customers can be served in relative privacy in the comfort of their own cars			1
sex workers agreeing to take part in the scheme did , however , have to get a permit and pay tax to avail of the drive - in 's creature comforts , which include a laundry , showers and cafe			1
smoke break : @entity1 's drive - thru brothel opened last august , with sex workers who agreed to move from their traditional haunts in the city centre allowed to ply their trade there safely and with a minimum of fuss kerb - crawling zone ... a helpful pictogram informs any passers - by of exactly what happens at the site they did n't have much choice in the matter			1
at the same time , @entity1 launched a crackdown on unregulated prostitution and confined the oldest trade to just the drive - thru and two other zones			0
city are officials are pleased with the results			0
' the new regulation of street prostitution has attained its objectives of protecting the population and the sex workers , ' they said in a statement			2
social services said that as well as protecting prostitutes , few neighbours were bothered by the comings and goings at the drive - in in the @entity107 district			0
no increase in street walkers had been noticed in the two other districts of the city where prostitution is tolerated , they said			0
crackdown : at the same time as opening the brothel and licensing two other parts of the city as paid - for sex zones , @entity1 's authorities curtailed the sex trade across the rest of the city			2
( picture posed by models ) residents had risen up in protest at the number of prostitutes descending after dark on the @entity125 , a main street near the city centre , and the authorities were worried about human trafficking if the trade was left unregulated			0
' the first year of the service has been positive , ' @entity1 social services said in their statement			2
the number of prostitutes working in the drive - in averaged 15 a night , half the number who worked the old red - light area before the city stepped in to regulate the business			0
a spokesperson for the @entity146 , a group which campaigns for the rights of sex workers in the @entity144 , told @entity147 that the initiative , while welcome , had its problems			1
' any initiative that truly makes selling sex safer would be welcome , but the " cleaning up " of areas where people engage in commercial sex is often in the interests of the public rather than the sex worker , who is often made more vulnerable by losing earnings and being " tucked away " out of sight , ' she said			0
' sex worker rights advocates all over the world along with organisations such as @entity164 , and @entity165 all agree that full decriminalisation , rather than @entity4 - style regulation and licensing , is the best human - rights based approach to keeping sex workers safe			1

site in an old industrial part of west @entity1 was opened last august
it has helpful signposts and *discreet* wooden ' sex boxes ' for services
but sex workers must have a permit and pay tax to use the facilities
sex workers ' rights advocates say full decriminalisation is a better solution
