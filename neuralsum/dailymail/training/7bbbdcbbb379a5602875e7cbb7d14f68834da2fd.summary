by @entity0 the @entity4 administration is considering creating a pilot program giving refugee status to young people from @entity8 as part of a plan to slow the influx of unaccompanied minors arriving at the @entity15 - @entity14 border , @entity2 officials said thursday			1
the plan would involve screening youths in their home country to determine whether they qualify for refugee status			1
the program would be limited in scope and would start in @entity8 , one of the world 's most violent nations , but if successful could be expanded to include other @entity25 countries			1
no final decision on the matter has been made and said the proposal is among a range of ideas the @entity2 is considering , officials said			0
president @entity4 further cautioned on friday that the @entity15 accepts refugees based on ' fairly narrow criteria ' and the proposed screening process would in no way change that			1
' if that were the case it would be better for them to apply in - country rather than take a very dangerous journey up to @entity47 to make those same claims , ' he said			2
' but i think it â€™s important to recognize that that would not necessarily accommodate a large number of additional migrants			0
' similar in - country screening programs were set up in @entity74 after the @entity75 and in @entity76 in the 1990s			2
under the current proposal , the legal standard to qualify for refugee status would remain the same as it is for those who seek the status after arriving in the @entity15 , officials said , adding that the goal is to deter children who would not ultimately qualify for refugee status from attempting the dangerous trek to the @entity15 @entity60 president @entity86 did not take questions from the press after the meeting with the president , but speaking thursday in @entity91 , he said the three @entity25 nations have sought to pursue a unified approach			1
' we expect that the solution to this problem also is equal for the three countries , ' he said			0
the @entity98 has been pushing the @entity15 to treat children arriving at the southern border from @entity8 , @entity60 and @entity42 as refugees displaced by armed conflict			1
the trio of nations has become one of the most violent regions in the world in recent years , with swathes of all three countries under the control of drug traffickers and street gangs who rob , rape and extort ordinary citizens with impunity			0
crisis : tens of thousands of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors have crossed illegally into the @entity15 this year and presented themselves to federal agents , causing a humanitarian crisis on the @entity15 - @entity14 border since last fall , the @entity15 has seen a dramatic increase in the number of migrants from these three countries arriving at the southern border , particularly children traveling without any adult guardian			1
since october 1 , more than 16,000 unaccompanied children from @entity8 have been caught crossing the @entity14 border illegally			1
at the same time , more than 30,300 @entity8 traveling as families have also been arrested			1
the @entity15 has resisted calling the situation a refugee crisis , though @entity4 and top officials have called it a ' humanitarian crisis			1
' the refugee proposal was floated as @entity139 looked to be deadlocked on reaching any solution of its own on the border crisis with a five - week recess beginning at the end of next week			2
@entity4 's $ 3.7 billion emergency spending request looked to be going nowhere amid an impasse over whether to change a 2008 anti-trafficking law to make it easier to return the @entity25 kids back home			2
@entity151 reject such changes ; @entity153 insist on them			0
@entity2 @entity153 were to meet on the issue friday morning			0
' i think it needs to be resolved			0
that 's why we 're continuing to talk to our members about how to resolve it , ' house speaker @entity158 said			0
' but as i said before , the @entity2 needs to get its act together or it 's not going to get resolved			0
' @entity158 complained that the @entity2 initially pushed for changes in the 2008 law but , after a backlash from immigration advocacy groups , backed off its support			0
advocates say changes to the law would be a violation of the migrant youths ' due process			0
president @entity4 speaks to students and guests at the @entity177 in , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity15 , 24 july 2014 after @entity2 officials announced the administration is considering a new plan to slow undocumented immigrants arriving from @entity14 program : the screening will take place in @entity8 and if successful may be expanded to other @entity25 nations senator @entity188 , @entity179 , who authored the original provisions in the 2008 law to give additional protections to unaccompanied minors , said the administration now believes it needs more flexibility and has given her legislative language to consider			1
she said she is still reviewing it and has n't made any decisions			0
@entity197 , director of migration policy for the @entity198 , said the refugee proposal would be welcomed by the advocacy community as long as there was no attempt by the administration to pair it to changes to the trafficking law			0
' it can not substitute for providing full asylum rights for kids who have arrived in the @entity15 , ' he said			2
' there is no quid pro quo			0
' it is unclear what would happen to children and families who have already made the dangerous trek to the @entity15 if the refugee plan is implemented			1
homeland security secretary @entity216 has repeatedly said that there is no free pass for immigrants who come to the @entity15 illegally and that those who are caught crossing the border would be sent home			2
the administration would also have to outline what the refugee proposal would mean for @entity8 immigrants already in the @entity15			1
in 1999 , the @entity15 government granted @entity227 to @entity8 living in the country illegally in the wake of @entity230			1
the status has been renewed several times since then , and according to @entity233 about 60,000 @entity8 living in the @entity15 have received the protective status			1
immigrants from @entity42 received the protection in 2001 and @entity233 says about 202,000 @entity42 remain the @entity15 under @entity238			2
newly arriving immigrants from countries granted @entity238 are not eligible for the protection from deportation			0
@entity238 is used from time to time by the government to stop deportations to specific countries when authorities deem it is unsafe to return immigrants			0
the @entity248 first reported that the @entity2 was considering the refugee program .			2

the government is considering a program to give refugee status to young people from @entity8
the plan would involve screening youths in @entity8 to determine whether they qualify for refugee status
if successful the program could be expanded to other @entity25 families
the goal is to deter children who would not ultimately qualify for refugee status from attempting the dangerous trek to the @entity15
