' magmatic water ' - liquid that originates from within the moon 's interior - was detected by @entity4 's @entity3 ( @entity2 ) instrument aboard the @entity24 's @entity6 spacecraft for the first time from lunar orbit			1
the find confirms analyses performed recently on moon rocks brought to @entity31 by @entity33 astronauts four decades ago , researchers said			1
scientists hope the discovery could help them understand how the moon was formed			0
the @entity2 instrument discovered evidence of magmatic water locked in mineral grains on the surface of the moon , having imaged the lunar impact crater @entity43 , which lies near the lunar equator			2
@entity4 scientists chose to study this area in particular because they could better quantify the amount of water inside the rocks due to the crater 's location and the type of rocks it holds			0
the central peak of the crater is made up of a type of rock that forms deep within the lunar crust and mantle when magma is trapped underground , according to the study , which is published in @entity63			0
' this rock , which normally resides deep beneath the surface , was excavated from the lunar depths by the impact that formed @entity43 crater , ' said @entity69 , a planetary geologist at the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) in @entity72 , @entity73			0
the @entity2 instrument discovered evidence of magmatic water locked in mineral grains on the surface of the moon , having imaged the lunar impact crater @entity43 ( pictured ) which lies near the lunar equator ' compared to its surroundings , we found that the central portion of this crater contains a significant amount of hydroxyl - a molecule consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom - which is evidence that the rocks in this crater contain water that originated beneath the lunar surface , ' she said			1
in 2009 , @entity2 provided the first mineralogical map of the lunar surface and discovered water molecules in the polar regions of the moon , thought to be a a thin layer that formed from a solar wind hitting the moon 's surface			2
however , @entity43 crater is in a region with an unfavorable environment for solar wind to produce significant amounts of water on the surface			0
@entity104 @entity103 , centre director at @entity4 's @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 , said : ' @entity4 missions like @entity109 and the @entity110 and instruments like @entity2 have gathered crucial data that fundamentally changed our understanding of whether water exists on the surface of the moon			2
' in 2009 , @entity2 provided the first mineralogical map of the lunar surface ( pictured ) and discovered water molecules in the polar regions of the moon , thought to be a a thin layer that formed from a solar wind hitting the moon 's surface the detection of internal water from orbit means scientists can begin to test some of the findings from sample studies in a broader context , including in regions that are far from where the @entity33 sites are clustered on the near side of the moon			1
for many years , researchers believed that the rocks from the moon were bone - dry and any water detected in the @entity33 samples had to be contamination from @entity31			0
dr @entity141 said : ' now that we have detected water that is likely from the interior of the moon , we can start to compare this water with other characteristics of the lunar surface			0
' this internal magmatic water also provides clues about the moon 's volcanic processes and internal composition , which helps us address questions about how the moon formed and how magmatic processes changed as it cooled			1

magmatic water provides clues about the moon 's volcanic processes which could help scientists understand how the moon formed
