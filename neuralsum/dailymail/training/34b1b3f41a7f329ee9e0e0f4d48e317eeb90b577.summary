by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ @entity3 @entity4 hopes to conclude negotiations with @entity6 in the next few days , aware that potential members of his coaching staff are under pressure to clarify their positions with current employers			1
@entity12 will take over as @entity14 head coach after the @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity17 ’s goalkeeping coach , has promised to tell @entity12 today whether he will remain with the national team or move with @entity17 to @entity6			1
another pressing issue for @entity17 , it seems , is an assurance that transfer funds will extend to the signing of the three @entity25 players he thinks @entity6 need			2
as well as @entity29 ’s @entity28 , @entity17 wants @entity31 ’s @entity30 and @entity32			1
imminent ? @entity33 says @entity4 will be appointed @entity6 manager in the next week top target : @entity30 is being eyed by @entity17 as part of his @entity38 makeover also wanted : defender @entity32 ( left ) and midfielder @entity28 are on @entity17 's wishlist senior sources at @entity6 are reluctant to confirm the appointment of a permanent successor to @entity43 is imminent , however			1
they argue that it might make sense to be patient and wait for someone such as @entity47 to become available			0
other sources expect the process to accelerate , with @entity17 very much the favourite now that @entity47 has guided his @entity52 side to the @entity54 final			0
@entity6 are keen to see interim player - manager @entity55 and the @entity56 — namely @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 — remain part of any future coaching set - up in the belief that ‘ continuity is important ’			2
with @entity17 keen to bring in a team of his own , including @entity16 , a potential for conflict in negotiations with @entity6 has been highlighted			2
leader : @entity69 will hope he is handed the captain 's armband next season in charge : @entity55 is currently the interim manager at @entity6 in @entity14 , though , sources close to @entity17 insist it is not an insurmountable problem , given that the 62 - year - old will see the value in having individuals such as @entity55 involved at the club			1
as for his three @entity25 targets , their combined cost could be in excess of £ 100million — before @entity6 even look at other signings , including @entity86 and @entity87			0
they would certainly amount to an expensive trio , even though the cost could be reduced if @entity90 returns to @entity31 as part of any deal			0
he joined @entity6 from the @entity25 club in june 2012			0
@entity17 certainly wants talks to be concluded one way or the other as soon as possible			0
he is aware that there is a small window of a few weeks when he could devote some time to planning for next season at @entity6 before his attention has to turn to @entity14 and the @entity15 .			1

@entity4 wants @entity6 move sorted in the near future
the @entity14 boss wo *n't* want his @entity15 preparations *distracted*
@entity17 has targeted @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity32
