by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 will accept openly gay youths starting @entity4 , marking a historic shift that spells major changes to policies on tentmates and showers			1
yet despite their be-prepared approach , @entity2 leaders are rooting for the change to be a non-event , comparable to another @entity4 in 2000 when widespread fears of digital - clock chaos to start the new millennium proved unfounded			1
‘ my hope is there will be the same effect this jan. 1 as the @entity23 scare , ’ said @entity17 , a @entity2 national executive board member who chairs the policy implementation committee			1
‘ it 's business as usual , nothing happens and we move forward			2
’ historic change : the @entity2 will accept openly gay youths starting on @entity4 following a vote in may some churches are dropping their sponsorship of @entity34 units because of the new policy and some families are switching to a new conservative alternative called @entity38			1
but massive defections have n't materialized and most major sponsors , including the @entity42 and @entity43 churches , are maintaining ties			0
‘ there has n't been a whole lot of fallout , ’ said @entity17 , a lawyer from @entity45 , @entity46 ‘ if a church said they would n't work with us , we 'd have a church right down the street say , ` we 'll take the troop			0
' ‘ the new inclusive policy was approved in may , with support from 60 per cent of the 1,400 voting members of the @entity2 's @entity2			1
the vote followed acrimonious nationwide debate , and was accompanied by an announcement that the @entity2 would continue to exclude openly gay adults from leadership positions			2
under the new membership policy , youths can no longer be barred from the @entity65 , @entity2 or coed venturers program solely on the basis of sexual orientation			1
however , gay scouts will face some limitations			1
‘ any sexual conduct , whether heterosexual or homosexual , by youth of @entity75 age is contrary to the virtues of scouting , ’ says one @entity2 document			2
‘ no member may use scouting to promote or advance any social or political position or agenda , including on the matter of sexual orientation			0
’ trying to anticipate potential friction , the @entity2 has distributed extensive explanations and question - and - answer documents related to the policy			1
under the @entity2 ’s rules , a scout could not march in uniform in a gay - pride parade or engage in advocacy , promotion , or the distribution of information of a sexual nature			1
a frequently - asked - questions document anticipates that some objections might surface from parents - or @entity2 themselves - in cases where a unit includes an openly gay boy			1
restrictions : under the @entity105 s rules , a scout could not march in uniform in a gay - pride parade or engage in advocacy regarding shower and toilet facilities , the @entity2 says it is encouraging units to provide greater individual privacy , including moving away from the tradition of group showers			1
‘ the adult leaders have the discretion to arrange private showering times and locations , ’ the @entity2 says			2
sleeping arrangements also are addressed , with specific decisions left to unit leaders			0
‘ if a @entity34 or parent of a @entity34 makes a request to not tent with another @entity34 , their wishes should be honored , ’ says the @entity2			1
@entity17 says ‘ isolated pockets ’ of problems are likely to surface , but overall he expects adult leaders will have the skills to defuse potential conflicts			0
there are about 1 million adult leaders and 2.6 million youth members in scouting in the @entity135 of the roughly 110,000 scout units , 70 per cent are sponsored by religious organizations , including several conservative denominations that had long supported the @entity2 's exclusion of gay youth and gay adults			1
national movement : there are about 1 million adult leaders and 2.6 million youth members in @entity75 in the @entity135 among the major sponsors , the @entity145 made clear its disappointment with the new youth policy , but left the decision on whether to cut ties up to local churches			1
an @entity145 spokesman , @entity152 , said it was not known how many churches have done so			0
the biggest sponsor of @entity34 units - the @entity157 - based @entity155 - commended the @entity2 for a ‘ thoughtful , good - faith effort ’ to address a challenging issue , and said it would stay engaged in scouting			1
keeping an open mind : @entity162 , the scoutmaster of @entity163 55 in @entity164 , said he 'd never considered sexual orientation when accepting members @entity167 of the @entity168 , the nation 's largest council , said its youth membership had increased from 74,148 in december 2012 to 75,863 this month			2
like the @entity43 , the @entity42 has generally accepted the new policy			0
many parishes will continue to sponsor @entity34 units , though a few have considered cutting ties			2
the @entity176 on @entity75 posted a question - and - answer document on its website , delving into the intersection of @entity75 policy and @entity42 teaching			2
‘ the @entity184 teaches that individuals who disclose a same - sex attraction are to be treated with the same dignity due all human beings ... and also teaches that engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage is always immoral , ’ says the @entity182 , concluding that the new @entity2 policy does not contradict @entity42 teaching			1
the ultimate decision on whether parishes would maintain or cut ties with the @entity2 was left to individual bishops			2
several expressed cautious support for continuing in scouting			0
‘ as the new policy currently stands , i see no reason to prohibit our parishes from sponsoring @entity34 troops , ’ said rev. @entity197 , bishop of @entity201 's @entity200 - @entity199 diocese			2
‘ at the same time , it is critical that we be vigilant on how this new policy is interpreted and implemented			0
’ one likely target of such scrutiny will be former defense secretary @entity209 , scheduled to take over in the spring as the @entity2 's next president			1
as leader of the @entity212 , @entity209 helped change the military 's ‘ @entity214 ’ policy banning openly gay soldiers , and gay - rights groups hope he will try to end the @entity2 's ban on gay adult leaders			1
the new youth policy was approved during a @entity2 meeting in may in the @entity224 - @entity223 suburb of @entity225 , near the @entity2 ' national headquarters in @entity227 , @entity228			1
bigotry : a protestor is pictured april 6 2000 , in @entity231 , as @entity2 were on trial against gay scoutmaster @entity233 @entity228 has a long heritage of @entity75 , with tens of thousands of youth members and many families claiming generations of @entity238			1
among them is gov. @entity240 , who achieved @entity75 's highest rank growing up in the small town of @entity243			0
the membership debate was closely followed by local scouts on both sides ; some carried signs and held rallies outside the meeting place			0
but in subsequent months , the debate has quieted			0
@entity162 , scoutmaster of @entity252 in @entity164 , said membership in his troop has remained steady at about 225 boys			0
‘ we never considered sexual orientation , and i do n't think many troops really did , ’ @entity162 said			0
‘ i do n't know whether we had scouts who are homosexual			2
i do n't inquire ... it 's not a matter of concern			2
’ opting out : @entity264 and @entity265 is signing up local units for a new conservative alternative to the @entity2 called @entity38 @entity162 said the membership debate , while closely covered in the media , did not extend into his meetings with leaders and parents , besides occasional discussion of the policy at camp - outs			1
he says he has n't talked to any @entity34 about his sexual orientation and does n't intend to			0
‘ i know that this is something that people felt was a momentous turning point for @entity75 , ’ @entity162 said			0
‘ everybody i know has made scouting available to every boy who wants it , and that 's what we continue to do			0
’ however , some @entity228 parents and leaders have decided to switch to @entity38 , an alternative which declares itself ‘ a @entity291 adventure , character , and leadership program for young men			1
’ among them is @entity265 , a business consultant from the @entity223 area who is signing up local units for the group			0
so far , he said he has 25 groups ‘ pre-chartered ’ for a january 1 launch date in the territory covered by the @entity2 's @entity304 and @entity305 councils			1
that 's modest compared to the 39,000 scouts served by the @entity304 council alone			0
@entity265 is part of a family with four generations of @entity238			0
his older son recently earned his @entity238 rank and his younger son was on the verge of doing likewise			0
but @entity265 said he could not stand by after the policy change			1
‘ as @entity291 , from a scriptural basis , we love all folks , but the scripture is very clear that being homosexual is a sin , ’ @entity265 said			0
‘ we 've got to be able to hold a strong line and set a consistent example for our young men			0
’ @entity265 said his decision to cut ties with the @entity2 rested in part on the @entity329 , which includes the admonition to remain ‘ morally straight			0
’ @entity331 of @entity332 , @entity228 , is helping @entity334 members in the @entity335 , a mostly rural , conservative region			1
@entity331 said he offered to let his 14 - year - old son stay in @entity2 and achieve his @entity238 rank , but the boy elected to join him in @entity334			2
@entity265 and @entity338 said they did n't consider themselves rivals to the @entity2 , though they 've chosen a different path			2
‘ our tradition comes out of @entity2 , ’ @entity331 said			0
‘ we 'll never not honor that heritage			0

under the new policy , youth members can not be barred from @entity65 , @entity2 or coed venturers because they *'re* gay
gay scouts wo n't be allowed to march in gay pride parades in their uniforms or engage in advocacy
units are being urged to move away from group showers to give scouts more privacy
parents will have the option to request not to tent their child with another scout
@entity2 's biggest sponsor the @entity157 - based @entity155 *praised* the organization for the policy change
@entity38 in @entity228 has emerged as @entity291 conservative alternative to the @entity2
