by @entity0 her hair was looking perfect beneath the sparkling tiara			0
the beautician had done her spray - on tan , nails and fake lashes , and outside , the limousines were already waiting			2
@entity9 felt particularly special in her £ 200 sequinned dress and now she was ready to go to the prom			1
this was how an 11 - year - old celebrated her last day at primary school – thanks to a proud mum who splashed out £ 1,000 to make sure her daughter shone at the end of term ball			1
@entity9 's huge prom extravaganza included this £ 200 dress and three limousines in an outing that might have come straight from @entity24 , @entity9 joined 19 classmates for the kind of juvenile extravaganza that is catching on in @entity28 – even for pre-teen schoolchildren			1
the prom phenomenon has become popular after being imported from the @entity31 , where it was intended for 16 - year - olds			2
in @entity36 , @entity35 , however , they appear to have turned the clock forward a little			2
@entity38 took an extra job as a cleaner to raise enough money to pay for the day of her daughter ’s dreams			1
they began planning her appearance at the junior prom as soon as they got the date for the £ 15 - a - head party for pupils leaving @entity52			1
the prom , which was organised by parents , not the school , was arranged for @entity57 pupils moving to secondary schools			2
dress - £ 200 bag - £ 20 shoes - £ 30 jewellery - £ 10 @entity60 's @entity61 - £ 140 perfume - £ 42 photographer - £ 200 cars - £ 300 @entity64 - £ 20 drinks - £ 23 ticket - £ 15 nineteen giggling girls met at a nearby house to enjoy non-alcoholic sparkling drinks from champagne flutes at a red - carpet gathering , pictured by a professional photographer			1
then a trio of white , pink and silver limousines took them to the party venue , a local pub. it was the climax of @entity9 ’s big day – but the preparation had started long before			0
she and her mother , a school dinner lady , chose the satin and royal blue netting dress online and ordered shoes and a clutch bag to match			2
make - up artist @entity83 visited the family home a month in advance to trial hair and make - up styles			2
then she spent six hours getting @entity88 , spread over two visits – one on the eve of the prom , another on the day of the big event			0
for three months , mrs @entity9 had been getting up at 5am , to start work at 6am , cleaning a factory for two hours			0
then she returned to take @entity97 to school , did the housework – and headed back out to her full - time job before 11am			1
was it all worth it ? ‘ every penny , ’ said mrs @entity9 , 36			0
‘ i just wanted to give my daughter the biggest , best prom she could imagine			0
’ in order to pay for her daughter 's prom package @entity110 ( right ) took on an extra job as a cleaner @entity110 and @entity9 began planning in february as soon as they got the date for the ball on july 5 her beauty routine included fake tan , fake nails and lashes during two visits from a beautician and stylist @entity9 and @entity110 picked the blue netting and satin gown and ordered matching shoes and clutch bag @entity127 has brought out a new range of prom dresses , with sizes starting at age four as over-the - top as it might seem , @entity9 's story is no way unique			1
it seems that proms to mark the end of primary school are the latest pre-teen craze and the hype has been building for a few years			1
end - of - primary school proms are n’t just growing in numbers , but also in glitz , glamour and expense			1
the @entity146 aired a documentary called @entity148 , which told the story of the children at two schools in the three months running up to this latest rite of passage			2
the children demanded ‘ pamper parties , horse - drawn carriages , limos , @entity156 , red carpets and non-alcoholic cocktails - not to mention prizes for prom king , prom queen and couple most likely to get married			1
’ and the parents had little choice but to stump up the cash			0
@entity166 , a discussion forum for mothers , was quick to catch onto the trend , writing on its site : ‘ on @entity166 over the years we 've heard of @entity174 proms - with parents spending a small fortune on dresses and tuxedos , limousines and even a helicopter to make a grand entrance ! ' beauty salons have seen a surge in children being booked in for tans and make - up sessions to look their best at the prom			1
' it is also a hot topic on parenting forum @entity191			0
one user posted : ‘ today [ my son ] brought home a letter informing us that to celebrate year 6 leaving , they are having a prom			2
he is horrified , as apparently a lot of the girls are insisting on dates			0
@entity204 would rather lick his own foot than be seen publicly with a girl , what with him being 11 and all			0
' ' tonight the fb discussions have started between parents arranging limos			0
limos for 11 - year - olds			0
surely this is beyond bats * * * crackers ? is this insanity normal now ? what 's wrong with a disco and a handful of @entity221 ? bewildered			0
’ an equally unimpressed mother called @entity223 responded : ‘ total waste of time			0
" @entity148 " are one of the worst things to happen to @entity28 schools in the last 20 years			0
’ while @entity229 added : ‘ leaving six form fine , when you have the figure for suites and long dresses			0
any younger no , ’ with @entity235 musing : ‘ good heavens			0
it will be proms for leaving nursery school next			1
’ and in fact , @entity235 could be right : @entity127 has brought out a new range of prom dresses , with sizes starting at age four			1
a spokesperson for @entity245 ( parentsoutloud.com ) said : ' whist i understand the reason mothers wish to give their child a very special prom night at 11 - years - old this is verging on madness			1
' having spent £ 1,000 for a prom to now to find in two years there will be another ... this is an @entity31 trend we could have lived without ; a total mass marketing event which runs on parent blackmail			2
' it 's impossible to not partake but it should be confined to one prom only , possibly at the end of year 11 , and leave primary school children to be just that			1
