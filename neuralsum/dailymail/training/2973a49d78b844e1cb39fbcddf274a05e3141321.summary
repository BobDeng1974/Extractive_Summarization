by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 believes @entity4 will have teams running scared this season as he tipped the @entity8 winger to maintain his relentless progress			1
the 19 - year - old has thrived under @entity3 ' guidance and , given his sparkling pre-season form , he has already been installed as one of the favourites to win the @entity16 award next april			1
@entity4 was one of the few @entity8 players to emerge from the @entity19 finals with his reputation intact and he will be at the forefront for @entity3 in the forthcoming campaign , charged with the task of keeping @entity24 on the front foot after the sale of @entity27 to @entity28			1
talent : @entity3 believes @entity4 will continue his rapid rise to the top diminutive : @entity4 earned rave reviews for a series of scintillating displays for the @entity35 last season @entity3 said after @entity24 had beaten @entity37 4 - 0 on sunday that @entity4 could ' become anything he wants to be ' and he has expanded on the point , claiming he is now playing with such swagger and confidence that teams will be forced to make special plans to deal with him			1
' something we said to @entity4 when he first broke into the team and something we 've reiterated is that you have to have an identity as a player , ' @entity3 explained			1
' his identity is he has to score goals and create goals – that 's what the job is			0
' he scored 10 goals last year and this kid is only going to get better			2
you look at one of the goals he scored against @entity60 ( in @entity61 ) – he cushioned it and then the finish – how many times have we seen ( @entity66 ) @entity66 produce a touch like that ? taking it through bodies and when it 's so tight in the box			0
' the great thing with watching him now is that he gets you off your seat			0
when he gets the ball you think ' something could happen here '			0
there was a moment against @entity60 when he had ( @entity82 ) @entity81 , ( @entity83 ) @entity84 and another midfielder coming back to press him and block the space			0
' so for teams to have that fear of him as a young shows his development			2
there is still work for him to do , but he knows that and is a really good boy who is developing really well			0
' it has n't always been this way between @entity3 and @entity4			1
during the manager ' s first summer in charge , there was the need for tough love and again last season , when he had two court appearances to contend with			2
the penny , however , has dropped since @entity4 was made a fixture in @entity24 ' s starting line - up and @entity3 is delighted that he is working with a more mature professional , one who knows what is expected of him			1
' when you 're so young , it 's important to understand exactly what your role is , ' said @entity3			1
' it 's not just about looking good , you have to be efficient and effective			0
his development has gone to a new level			0
he 's way above the level from when he first came in			0
wing wizard : @entity4 has forged a reputation as one of the top wingers in @entity8 ' tactically , technically , and what has been beautiful to watch with @entity4 has been his maturity and he 's turning into a beautiful young man , with all the responsibility			1
' @entity4 is taking it all in his stride and now he 's in a good place with every part of his game			1
it 's just about maintaining that commitment to his work			0
he 's still only 19 , but in big games he 's performed and he 's a wonderful talent			2
' @entity137 is also on course to return to action at the start of next month after clearing a significant hurdle in his rehabilitation			0
the @entity8 international suffered knee ligament damage during @entity24 's tour of the @entity146 three weeks ago but he has been given the green light to start running again at the club 's @entity149 training base			1
@entity137 was initially ruled out for six weeks but he has been working hard cut the time he is on the sidelines			0
if , for instance , he was fit to be included in @entity24 's trip to @entity155 on august 31 , he may yet be fit enough to figure in @entity157 's plans for the games with @entity159 and @entity160			2
@entity24 , however , will not rush him and it seems most likely that he will be available for the game against @entity162 on september 13 .			2

@entity3 is backing the 19 - year - old to continue his fine form for @entity24
the @entity24 boss believes the winger will continue to have teams running scared of him this season
