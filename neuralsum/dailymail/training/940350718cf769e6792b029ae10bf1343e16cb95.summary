men , are you named @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10 ? you 're in luck because you make the best husband , according to a new survey			0
a light - hearted piece of research looked at the virtues associated with common first names based on their experiences with their own partners as well as those of friends , relatives and colleagues			1
marriage material : women named @entity3 ( left , @entity25 ) and men named @entity8 ( right , @entity27 ) , make the best wife or husband , reveals a new study other names of wives who were most likely to be kind , caring , and good partners overall were @entity34 and @entity35			1
women named @entity37 and @entity38 were seen as particularly desirable and made the top list of wives men appreciate most			1
@entity41 and @entity42 also featured highly , while @entity43 rounded off the top ten			0
@entity45 rounded off the top five husbands women said make the best husband material			1
other names girls should keep an eye out for were @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 - all proving good catches , with @entity54 and @entity55 completing the top 10 names of the best husbands			1
girls called @entity59 and @entity60 just missed out on the list of favourable names for men 's better halves , as did @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			2
wonderful wife : women named @entity4 ( left , @entity70 ) and @entity5 ( right , @entity5 ) , apparently make the best wives eligible : women , looking for a husband ? go for a @entity10 ( like mr @entity74 ) or an @entity9 ( @entity76 's birth name ) men called @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 also narrowly missed out on the list of the top 10 most reliable husband names a spokesman for @entity84 , who commissioned the survey , said : ' every time we hear mention of a name we naturally associate particular values or impressions based on our past experiences			1
' it seems certain names tend to crop up more than others when thinking about the qualities of a good husband or wife and the lists no doubt make interesting reading to many			2
' of course , people should n't be judged on a name alone , so while men like @entity8 and @entity9 seem to be top of the pile , they 've still got to uphold that reputation day to day			0
great name ! @entity107 and @entity108 make great spouses if the survey results are anything to go by ' whether it 's through celebrities or people we already know , there 's a lot of power in a name and they are something everyone has an opinion on			2
' in both a personal and business context , whenever we first hear a name we immediately attribute certain qualities			0
' if starting a business or website the same consideration should always go toward choosing the name and could be the difference between success and failure			0
