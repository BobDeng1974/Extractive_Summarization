former glamour model @entity0 was left disappointed but unhurt after crashing on the first competitive day of the @entity2 season finale in @entity3			1
@entity6 , married to @entity5 superstar @entity4 , teamed up with @entity7 , the @entity8 pundit , to take part in the @entity10 however , after coming through the opening stages in treacherous conditions the @entity13 patron 's @entity11 collided with a log pile on the inside of a right corner , collapsing the front right wheel and effectively ending the @entity21 's race			1
the car suffered major damage to the front right corner as well as a smashed front windscreen , and after the fans helped to move the car to safety from the middle of the track , they were towed off the stage			2
@entity7 stressed that the accident was not his partner 's fault but had come from his own error			1
' it was totally my fault			0
the stage was drying out and i was trying to go quicker			0
i took a downhill corner in fifth gear and lost the back of the car			2
as a result we swung into the logs , which cut into the front of the chassis			0
but the main thing of course is that @entity0 and i were unharmed , and the marshals did a fantastic job of getting us and the car to safety			1
' it wo n't be easy , but hopefully the @entity75 guys can get us back out on stage tomorrow			0
' @entity6 tied the knot with @entity4 , pictured together at the @entity78 of the @entity79 , in 2012 the car 's problems were not diagnosed as terminal , meaning a race against time to replace and rebuild the front end before it can be re-entered tomorrow			1
@entity6 was clearly very disappointed after the crash , although she is hopeful that she can get back in contention			2
' we 're both gutted but the most important thing is that neither of us is injured			0
@entity7 took the corner a little tight and clipped a log pile which flung the back end out but he did amazingly well to control the car and prevent us from going in to a huge ditch the other side			1
' the damage meant that @entity99 could n't open his door and had to climb out of my side			0
initially i must admit i thought that was the end of our entire rally , but thankfully the team are hard at work and positive that we will be competing tomorrow			0
' we were both a bit shaken up , but if the car 's fixed i want to go out again tomorrow			0
' @entity7 , who competed with @entity110 last year , and @entity6 will race at the @entity2 finale former glamour model @entity6 , 23 , ' can not wait to tackle ' the @entity3 event which starts on thursday			1
