by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 30 may 2013 whether listening to the blues or pop , the human brain is wired to make the same music - colour connections wherever we come from , according to a new study			1
experts discovered that the colour a person associated with a melody depends on how it makes them feel and not the culture they came from			1
this suggests that humans share a common emotional palette when it comes to music and colour that appears to be intuitive and can cross cultural barriers			1
singing ( and seeing ) the blues : research carried out by @entity22 found that regardless of where you are born , the same colours are associated with the same melodies in the study , @entity28 's uplifting @entity27 in g major was most associated with bright yellow and orange , whereas his dour requiem in d minor was more likely to be linked to dark , bluish grey			1
moreover , people in both the @entity37 and @entity38 linked the same pieces of classical orchestral music with the same colours			2
' the results were remarkably strong and consistent across individuals and cultures and clearly pointed to the powerful role that emotions play in how the human brain maps from hearing music to seeing colors , ' said professor @entity49 , lead author of a paper , @entity22			1
using a 37 - colour palette , the study found that people tend to pair faster - paced music in a major key with lighter , more vivid , yellow colors , whereas slower - paced music in a minor key is more likely to be teamed up with darker , greyer , bluer colors			1
scientists hope that the findings will shed light on synesthesia , a condition that links specific colours with places and even numbers ' surprisingly , we can predict with 95 percent accuracy how happy or sad the colours people pick will be based on how happy or sad the music is that they are listening to , ' said professor @entity49			1
the findings may have implications for creative therapies , advertising and even music player gadgetry			1
for example , they could be used to create more emotionally engaging electronic music visualisers , computer software that generates animated imagery synchronized to the music being played			2
currently the colours and patterns appear to be randomly generated and do not take emotion into account , researchers said			0
they may also provide insight into synesthesia , a neurological condition in which the stimulation of one perceptual pathway , such as hearing music , leads to automatic , involuntary experiences in a different perceptual pathway , such as seeing colors			1
synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight			2
another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters , shapes , numbers or people 's names with a sensory perception such as smell , colour or flavour			1
around 4 % of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women			2
most synesthesists tend to be left - handed there are no dangerous side - effects to the having the condition famous synesthesists include @entity123 , @entity124 as well as the artists @entity125 and @entity127			0
an example of sound - to - color synesthesia was portrayed in the 2009 movie @entity131 when cellist @entity132 experiences a mesmerizing interplay of swirling colors while listening to the @entity136 symphony			0
artists such as @entity138 and @entity139 may have used music - to - color synesthesia in their creative endeavours			1
around 100 men and women participated in the study , of which half resided in the @entity146 and the other half in @entity148 , @entity38			0
in three experiments , they listened to 18 classical music pieces by composers @entity152 , @entity28 and @entity153 that varied in tempo and in major versus minor keys			0
in the first experiment , participants were asked to pick five of the 37 colors that best matched the music to which they were listening			0
the palette consisted of vivid , light , medium , and dark shades of red , orange , yellow , green , yellow - green , green , blue - green , blue , and purple			1
participants consistently picked bright , vivid , warm colors to go with upbeat music and dark , dull , cool colors to match the more tearful or somber pieces			0
separately , they rated each piece of music on a scale of happy to sad , strong to weak , lively to dreary and angry to calm			0
two subsequent experiments studying music - to - face and face - to - color associations supported the researchers ' hypothesis that ' common emotions are responsible for music - to - color associations '			0
study participants listened to 18 classical music by composers @entity152 , @entity28 and @entity153 that varied in tempo and in major versus minor keys			2
they were then asked to associated certain colours with the pieces for example , the same pattern occurred when participants chose the facial expressions that ' went best ' with the music selections			0
upbeat music in major keys was consistently paired with happy - looking faces while subdued music in minor keys was paired with sad - looking faces			0
similarly , happy faces were paired with yellow and other bright colours and angry faces with dark red hues			2
next , professor @entity49 and his research team plan to study participants in @entity212 where traditional music employs a wider range of scales than just major and minor			2
' we know that in @entity38 and the @entity37 the responses are very similar , " he said			0
' but we do n't yet know about @entity218 or @entity212			0

study by @entity22 found that people associate uplifting music with yellow and orange hues and sober melodies with greyish blue
experts hope that study will shed light on synesthesia , a condition that causes people to associate places , letters and number with colour
may also have implications for advertising , creative therapies , advertising and even music player gadgetry
