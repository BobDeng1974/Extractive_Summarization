by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 8 august 2013 dog owners will often swear that their four - legged friend understands exactly how they feel			0
and now researchers have suggested that far from reading too much into their pet ’s actions , they may well be right			0
not only do dogs yawn when humans do , they are much more likely to do so if that person is their master			1
a new study shows how the irresistible impulse to yawn can even spread between humans and their dogs			1
according to researchers in @entity15 this could be an indication of empathy two cameras were used to record dogs ' responses during the testing sessions			1
owners called their dogs by name and then yawned , or made a yawning movement , after making eye contact scientists say this behaviour reveals that dogs have a human - like ability to show empathy – the capacity to identify with another ’s feeling			1
lead researcher dr @entity32 said : ‘ our study suggests that contagious yawning in dogs is emotionally connected in a way similar to humans			1
‘ although our study can not determine the exact underlying mechanism operative in dogs , the subjects ’ physiological measures taken during the study allowed us to counter the alternative hypothesis of yawning as a distress response			2
’ for the study , published in the journal @entity49 , the @entity15 team from the @entity50 recruited 25 dogs and their owners			1
dogs watched their owner , or a stranger , yawn or mimic yawning mouth movements , while having their heart rate monitored			2
the researchers found that the dogs yawned significantly more in response to their owners ’ actions than to the strangers ’			2
dogs were much more likely to yawn in response to their owner yawning than the actions of a stranger			2
the dogs were also far more sensitive to genuine yawns the dogs ' heart rates were monitored using a device strapped to their chests during the testing they were also far more sensitive to genuine yawns , and yawned significantly less often after seeing fake movements			1
one possible explanation for the behaviour is that it is a tension - releasing reaction to mild stress			0
but the animals were found to have maintained a constant heartbeat during the test which , combined with their heightened response to their owners ’ actions , suggests they are reflecting their master ’s feelings			2
in non-human primates , the phenomenon of contagious yawning has been observed in chimpanzees , bonobos , and gelada baboons the researchers concluded : ‘ our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning ... may indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in domesticated dogs			1
’ during the testing sessions two cameras were used to record the dogs ’ responses			0
owners called their dogs by name , made eye contact with them and then yawned or made a yawning movement			0
four test sessions lasting five minutes were conducted , involving either a real or fake yawn by an owner or a stranger			0
at the same time , the dogs ’ heart rates were monitored using a device strapped to their chests			0
in the human world it is known that contagious yawning affects around half of all adults , yet the causes remain unclear			0
among animals , the phenomenon has been observed not only in dogs but also in chimpanzees , bonobo monkeys , and gelada baboons			0
and like humans , they are more responsive to yawns from individuals with whom they have close social bonds			1
a study earlier this year also found that dogs really can see things from a human perspective – and that it influences their decision making			1
researchers discovered that when a person forbids a dog from taking food , they are more than twice as likely to disobey in a dark room than a lit room			0
the study suggest man ’s best friend first considers what a person is able to see , before choosing whether to break the rules .			0

study shows dogs are far more sensitive to genuine yawns from humans
@entity15 scientists believe this suggests a rudimentary form of empathy
a closer social bond was found to make dogs more responsive to yawns
