he was taken to a compound near @entity18 and locked up with an @entity6 cellmate - who could still be in captivity - before escaping from a gap in a basement window on july 29 , he said			1
before he fled , @entity0 said he was beaten with a metal cable across his feet and given electrical shocks			1
he also said the rebels cleaned out his bank accounts and emailed his family pretending to be him and assuring them he was well , he told the @entity29			1
the paper chose not to identify the other @entity6 captive at the request of his family			1
while @entity0 's abduction has not been reported before , he was one of several westerners in rebel - held territory since the civil war began			1
he said he was traveling without a commission from a media organization and had attempted to leave @entity18 by taxi on december 31			1
but the vehicle was stopped and he was taken by the rebels			1
rebels : he was held by @entity14 ; a member is seen riding a motorcycle in @entity46 locked up : the compound was near @entity18 , where a @entity49 fighter in pictured above he said on one occasion , dressed in an orange jumpsuit , he was filmed confessing to espionage after the captors coerced them into doing so			2
@entity0 was also whipped with cable on the soles of his feet while his knees were wedged in a car tire , and he was questioned by men speaking fluent @entity62 whom he guessed were @entity64			1
his captors masked his plight by sending emails from his account			2
they also demanded to know his card pins to raid his online bank account and buy computers and car parts with his @entity74 account			2
he said he was moved several times and often held alongside @entity2 accused of fighting for the government , and he was also taken for a time by another group , @entity78			0
alone : he was working as a freelance photographer when he was taken on december 31 at one place , where he was held in april , a boy as young as 12 was allowed to beat prisoners and use a taser gun to shock them			1
but amid the torture and frustrations , he said that there were moments when he was not treated forcefully , including when he was seized by three men with their faces covered with black cloths			0
' they were so nonchalant , ' he said			0
' they did n't point a gun at me , and moved me very gently			0
' when he was taken to the compound - where he thought they 'd release him after looking at his photographs - they were polite , he said			2
one man even warned him the glass was hot when he was given tea , he said			0
treatment also improved when he converted to @entity104 and was given a @entity105 in @entity62			0
but amid these moments of solace came the fear of being beaten and the boredom of pacing around a tiny cell			2
he shared the cell with two roommates , but rather than bond , they fought			0
the rebels never gave any indication of when he could be released , but he deduced that many men had been held captive for much longer than he had been there			2
' in your country you have a saying : you are innocent until proven guilty , ' one captor said			0
' here we have the opposite			0
you are guilty until proven innocent			0
we do not know who you are			0
' @entity0 's mother grew worried about getting no word from her son and reported him missing to the @entity132 on january 31 - exactly one month after he was taken			1

i have access to @entity143 for like 5 minutes or so , and i will not be able to log in my e-mail for at least the next few weeks			0
' @entity0 eventually slipped from a gap in a basement window early on july 29 , he said , leaving behind his bulkier compatriot			1
@entity0 said he was able to stand on his cellmate 's back and unravel a wire mesh covering a window			1
just before dawn , he wriggled out but the other @entity6 got stuck			0
' all right , go , ' he told @entity153 , who walked until he found other rebels			2
they drove him to the nearby @entity157 border and he was eventually helped by @entity6 officials			2
escape : he eventually fled after climbing through a gap in a basement window at the end of july crumbling : buildings are damaged from shelling at the @entity164 in @entity18 , where @entity0 was held as well as suggesting the attitudes of rebels towards foreigners , his experience also reveals the risks facing those reporting from @entity2 , notably freelance journalists traveling alone			1
in an interview before his trip last november , @entity0 said he had been a healthcare worker until recently and had funded his own trip			1
it was his plan to travel from @entity13 to @entity157 and @entity176 , before venturing across the border to a camp of displaced @entity2 families			0
' i do n't have a death wish , ' he said			0
