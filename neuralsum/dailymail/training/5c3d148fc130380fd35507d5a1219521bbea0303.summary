as home extensions go , it ’s rather more ambitious than your average conservatory			0
boasting a 16 - seat cinema , squash court , casino , bar and bowling alley , this is the little corner of @entity10 that grandfather of five @entity12 has built in his back garden			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , planning officials do n’t like the 10,000sq ft building one bit and mr @entity12 could be forced to tear it all down			1
the leisure - centre style complex also features a 25ft tall , three - storey doll ’s house , a soft play area and indoor tennis and badminton courts			1
@entity12 is appealing the council 's order to tear down the complex in his back garden which includes a bowling alley , cinema room , play area and badminton courts as he says he followed planning laws strictly mr @entity12 , 62 , says he did not think he needed permission when he started construction , and claims he built the complex 18ft into the ground to ensure it could not be seen			1
but council officials say the building breaches planning laws and have issued an enforcement notice ordering the millionaire accountant to return the land to its original state			1
he is appealing against the decision			0
‘ this is my family home , ’ he said			0
‘ all my children and my grandchildren come to visit , it ’s the place they all go			2
‘ if all this fuss had n’t been kicked up nobody would know it was there			0
‘ i have spoken to all my neighbours and none are bothered			0
they have all written letters of support to the council			1
’ the 62 - year - old said the centre was not bothering anyone and that he had built it for his grandchildren			1
he is pictured in the 16 - seat cinema despite spending almost a year on the project , council officers told mr @entity12 to tear the structure down			1
the games room complete with a bar table tennis , badminton and tennis are among the activities mr @entity12 had in mind when building the impressive structure for his family he began building the luxury extension at the back of his six - bedroom home in @entity77 , @entity78 , a year ago , and is set to finish it in only four weeks			1
mr @entity12 – who refuses to disclose how much the development has cost – wants his family to be able to watch a movie , play roulette and go bowling without leaving home			1
‘ if you look at the building from the street you ca n’t see it at all , ’ he said			0
‘ you can maybe just see a fence			0
you ’d have to be in a helicopter to see it			0
‘ i looked at the rules permitting development before i started			0
' they are very generous rules			0
there are five steps that must be adhered to , and this qualified in all of those			0
i built it to take advantage of all those things			0
’ the accountant says he built the structure for his family who constantly visit his home and that no one else would even know of it throughout the complex 's construction mr @entity12 said he followed planning rules meticulously to avoid any future disruption of the kind he is now facing			1
pictured , a squash court during building work @entity117 , whose property backs onto the complex , is the only neighbour to object to the building			2
he is unhappy with the height of the complex – and the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley			1
‘ at night , it is one of the quietest places you could live , ’ he said			0
‘ but the other night he had a practice with his skittle alley and it sounded like it was in my house			0
’ mr @entity12 has purchased the bungalow next door and is planning more works on his land			2
the enforcement notice issued by @entity137 states : ‘ the construction of walls and the erection of a building on the area of land which has been excavated is harmful to the residential amenity of the surrounding land in terms of the overbearing impact of a physical structure and the level of impact from the uncontrolled use of the building			1
’ a senior planning officer said : ‘ we also believe that a building such as this is not something we would be able to support with planning permission			2
we are looking for a workable solution			0
’ a spokesman for @entity137 said : ‘ @entity161 advised mr @entity12 of the need for planning permission and suggested he apply so that the merit of the development could be considered through the normal planning application process			2
‘ mr @entity12 disagreed that planning permission was necessary and continued with the development despite advice from the @entity161 that he should cease work			2
’ she added that the council later decided the development was ‘ unacceptable ’ , and that mr @entity12 then appealed against the enforcement notice			2
the outcome of that appeal will be decided in the coming months			0
she added : ‘ if it is found that permission was required the inspector has the power to grant planning permission for what has been built			2
‘ if the inspector decides it is unacceptable they can uphold the notice requiring its removal			0
’ the soft play area for his five grandchildren as it was being built over the past year			2
mr @entity12 spent months working on the property and maintains it is not harming anyone a state - of - the - art gym has also been installed in the complex in the complex which has taken almost a year to complete since breaking ground in addition to a cinema room , the accountant built a games room with plush leather sofas , a table - football game and chess boards mr @entity12 said he plans to appeal the planning committee 's ruling claiming he followed planning laws meticulously while building the centre these include , but are not limited to : one neighbour , whose house ( pictured ) backs onto the sports complex , said the noise from clattering bowling pins was too loud workmen dug 18ft in mr @entity12 's garden to ensure the structure could not be seen by neighbours from the other side of their fencing mr @entity12 dug out 9,000 tonnes of soil from his back garden to make room for the building and maintains that it is not imposing to neighbours the complex 's roof slopes down from fencing at the bottom of mr @entity12 's garden so that neighbours ' views are not obstructed @entity230 have written to the council in support of mr @entity12 but to no avail			1
a planning committee told the man he must restore his garden to its former state the complex as it was being built over the last year			1
