the @entity0 is relaxing its rules to allow air passengers to listen to music , play video games and watch films on their phones and tablets during takeoffs and landings			1
the change allowing the use of electronic devices from gate - to-gate will not , however , extend to making mobile phone calls during flights			1

in flight : the @entity0 is relaxing its rules to allow air passengers to listen to music , play video games and watch films on their phones and tablets during takeoffs and landings passengers will be told to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices to airplane mode			1
the @entity0 @entity34 confirmed the move last night , although it will be up to individual airlines to decide how soon to meet the new criteria			2
the change will mean that on transatlantic flights @entity40 passengers will be able to use their gadgets as they land on @entity0 soil			1
however , when they take off from @entity40 they will not be able to do so			2
under rules drawn up by the @entity40 ’s @entity46 , electronic devices can not be used during taxi , takeoff and landing on all fights entering or leaving @entity40 airspace			1
safety : connections to the internet to surf , exchange emails , text or download data will also still be banned below 10,000 feet however the rules could also change in @entity40 and across the world if the @entity0 research is shown to be credible			1
an @entity0 travel industry group welcomed the changes yesterday , calling them common - sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology			0
‘ we ’re pleased the @entity34 recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , ” said @entity66 , ceo of the @entity67			0
air safety officials backed the changes after agreeing that the electronic gadgets do not interfere with navigation systems and that data used to draw up the ban - typically imposed in aircraft across the world - was from back in the 1960s when such devices were very different			0
phones are excluded in the rule change because they were not involved in the @entity34 research , although safety officials are now expected to look at this issue separately			0
the original rules in the @entity0 were written in 1966 when it was thought that electromagnetic interference from computers and other devices could cause problems with navigation systems on board the plane			2
nowadays passenger jets are ‘ much more tolerant ’ to such interference and the gadgets themselves are much safer			0
the report says that this is because they use less power , transmit weaker signals and ‘ stay within a tighter range of frequencies ’			0
one key factor behind the @entity0 decision has been the sheer number of air passengers ignoring the rules			1
one survey found that , by accident or on purpose , one third of passengers had left their gadgets on when they should be turned off			2
the @entity46 in the @entity40 is said to be ‘ monitoring ’ the situation .			0

changes will not extend to making mobile phone calls during flights
passengers will be able to use gadgets on flights to @entity0 when they land
rules in @entity40 could change if @entity0 research found to be credible
