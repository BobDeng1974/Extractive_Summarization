@entity8 , 12 , was due to join her classmates from @entity10 in @entity11 on a five - day break to @entity13 in southern @entity3 next week , in a trip that her parents had paid for last year			1
but this week , just nine days before the holiday , @entity8 's parents say they were told by the school that she could not go after all because the school did not have the right insurance and staff were not allowed to administer medication if the girl fell ill. going nowhere : @entity8 , 12 , left , and right with father @entity24 , 40 , and the insulin pump she relies on @entity8 's father @entity26 , 40 , of @entity11 , said : ' i do n't think it is acceptable - it is so unfair			1
' all her mates are going and @entity8 said " why ca n't i when everybody else can ? " ' i had to tell her it was because of her diabetes			1
' is n't it hard enough having to deal with diabetes and then be singled out saying she ca n't go as though she is different to other children ? ' the staff member said the school was n't insured and also they ca n't touch @entity8 if she has a hypoglycemic attack			1
all they can do is give her painkillers and a plaster			0
' the risk assessment for this should have been done months ago , not nine days before the flight			0
' @entity8 was due to fly to @entity13 in southern @entity3 , famous for the @entity50 @entity49 palace @entity8 , who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of five , takes regular insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels			1
@entity55 offered to refund the family or cover half the cost of one parent travelling with @entity8 , but mr @entity26 , a former professional snooker player who now coaches children in the sport , said he could not have taken the time off work to accompany @entity8 at such short notice			2
he said the family was encouraging @entity8 to cope with her condition , but said the school should do more to help with such a common condition			2
' @entity8 is just getting to grips with her diabetes			0
we want her to be able to manage it independently , ' he said			0
' she ca n't be the only person in school with diabetes			0
