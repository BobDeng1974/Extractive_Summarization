by @entity0 @entity2 lawmakers are beginning to distance themselves from president @entity4 's decision to trade five known associates of the @entity6 with the terrorist network in exchange for the release of accused deserter @entity10			1
one @entity2 lawmaker called @entity4 ’s @entity6 trade ' a dangerous precedent ' as others are now reluctant to praise the president 's choice			1
even after @entity19 chief of staff @entity18 talked with senators from the president 's party at their weekly policy luncheon on tuesday , @entity2 would n't verbally support @entity4 's judgment call			1
the @entity19 officially went into damage - control mode on wednesday , announcing that @entity26 and intelligence officials would brief the @entity28 on the deal late wednesday behind closed doors			1
the @entity31 is in recess and will not return until next week			0
@entity36 is defending president @entity4 's decision to swap five members of the @entity6 for @entity44 sgt. @entity10 but many in his party are becoming increasingly disquiet ' deserter ' : senior dem @entity49 today said @entity10 's release ( exchange caught on video above ) in the swap with five @entity6 prisoners held at @entity56 put @entity57 at risk all around the world damning : rep. @entity49 added : ' since @entity61 we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups ' @entity49 , the senior @entity64 on the @entity65 , issued the strongest rebuke of @entity4 from a @entity64 so far when he said on tuesday that the trade set a ' dangerous precedent that puts all @entity57 at risk throughout the world			1
' ' since @entity61 we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups , ' @entity49 told the @entity72 ' what concerns me is the future			0
this puts all @entity57 at risk throughout the world , including our men and women on the front line … for kidnapping			0
' a dozen @entity83 refused to put their approval on record when approached by @entity86 on tuesday , and several used a classified briefing they were to receive today on the matter as an excuse to delay a verdict			0
' i just do n't know enough about it			0
i really do n't , ' senate majority whip @entity92 told the @entity86 yesterday afternoon			1
' all i 've heard is what i 've read in the press , ' @entity94 sen. @entity93 said			0
' i do n't have enough information at this point in time , ' sen. @entity97 of @entity98 said			0
' i do think getting our boys back home , that 's a good quality			0
i do have some issues about whether [ @entity10 ] deserted or not			2
' ' it depends on all the facts and circumstances of the case , ' @entity107 chairman @entity36 said			1
' i 'm not going to give you a conclusion in the case because i do n't know all the circumstances			1
' ' i 'm not going to comment until i look at the brief , ' @entity117 sen. @entity116 said , backtracking from her claim on sunday that @entity4 ' acted within his constitutional authority , which he should have done , ' to do the deed			2
' it 's very disturbing , ' said @entity124 sen. @entity123			0
' ' i 'm going to reserve judgment until after we have a secured briefing tomorrow , ' @entity123 , a vulnerable @entity64 up for re-election this year , said			0
the president and his administration hoped to be basking in the glow of @entity10 's release right up to november 's federal elections			1
but rumors began to fly quickly that @entity10 had purposefully wandered off base on the evening in question with no intention of returning			2
fading support : a host of @entity2 contacted today would not go on public record in support of @entity4 ( pictured today in @entity144 , @entity145 with @entity147 chancellor @entity146 ) coupled with news that search and rescue efforts for @entity10 resulted in the deaths of at least six soldiers , and the president 's admission on monday that it 's ' absolutely ' possible that the newly released @entity6 fighters could return to the battlefield , the @entity10 bounce began wear off			1
the @entity4 administration also fumbled the play by not telling @entity160 about the negotiations until the deal had already been sealed			2
the judgment lapse had lawmakers – whom the president is required to notify 30 days before releasing detainees from the @entity168 detention camp in @entity169 – on both sides of the aisle fuming this week			2
the president tried to temper criticism on monday by claiming that lawmakers had known for ' quite some time ' about the government 's negotiations with the @entity6 , but his remarks were met with immediate resistance			1
later that evening , deputy national security adviser @entity179 called @entity181 chair @entity180 , a @entity64 , and committee vice-chairman , @entity184 , a @entity185 , to apologize for the ' oversight			0
' @entity180 told reports on tuesday that the last official communication she had with administration officials about the proposition of trading prisoners from @entity168 for @entity10 was two and a half years ago			1
@entity180 said she and @entity184 sent then - secretary of state @entity192 a letter in december of 2011 and president @entity4 a letter in january 2012 with questions about the trade and both letters were met with detailed responses			1
but that was the last time she 'd heard about the swap until saturday , when she received a call informing her that @entity10 and the five @entity6 fighters had been released			1
' given the past briefings and concerns we had addressed , and these were from both [ congressional intelligence ] committees and the leadership of both committees , the concerns were bipartisan , and i strongly believe that we should have been consulted , ' @entity180 told reporters on tuesday			0
' i think you can see that we 're very dismayed about it , ' she added			0
sen. @entity216 , who is a former @entity217 chairman and still serves on the committee , said he shares in @entity180 's disappointment			2
' i do n't like it when the @entity19 says the intelligence committees were briefed			2
because we were n't , ' he told @entity223 on tuesday			0
@entity216 said he would have been fine with the administration telling only senior members of the committee , ' but when they say , " oh yes , they were briefed , " what they are referring to is 2011 - 2012 when i was still in grade school			0
' @entity107 chairman @entity36 defended president @entity4 on tuesday for making the call without @entity160 's explicit approval			1
yet , even he said , ' i intend to ask what risks we would have incurred if the secretary of defense had decided to wait 30 days after completing negotiations and providing the required notice to @entity160 rather than acting immediately			0
' @entity241 to judgment : secretary of defense @entity243 today said it was ' unfair to presume anything ' about the claims of @entity10 's desertion at a press conference today in @entity144 ' one of the issues i want to bring up : what is the precedent this sets or does n't set ? ' sen. @entity251 told @entity254 on wednesday			1
@entity19 majority leader @entity255 and @entity28 majority leader @entity256 are the only two lawmakers visibly standing by the president			1
' i support the president , and that means i support their understanding of what threat those people who were released with would be to our country , ' @entity255 said on tuesday at an event in @entity268 , @entity269			2
' i 'm saying i believe that the president has the assurances that he needs that those people will not be a threat to the @entity57 people , ' @entity255 continued			2
@entity256 said on the @entity28 floor today that , ' president @entity4 , as commander - in - chief , acted honorably in helping an @entity57 soldier return home to his family , ' ' unfortunately , opponents of president @entity4 have seized upon the release of an @entity57 prisoner of war , using what should be a moment of unity and celebration for our nation , as a chance to play political games , ' he continued			1
@entity256 argued that even if sgt. @entity10 deserted , it 's up to the military to punish him			1
' what was the alternative ? would any @entity57 honestly prefer that a @entity57 soldier remain in captivity until all of the questions have been answered ? ' @entity256 asked			0
in the @entity57 , we rescue our soldiers first and ask questions later			0
' secretary of defense @entity243 today said it was ' unfair to presume anything ' about the claims of @entity10 's desertion at a press conference today in @entity144			2
he repeated that the @entity57 had a responsibility to get its soldiers back			0
' let 's get the facts , but forst let 's focus on getting @entity315 well			0
