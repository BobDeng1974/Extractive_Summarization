by @entity0 in @entity1 the @entity3 administration rewrote the @entity5 's official story about the @entity7 , 2012 terror attack on the @entity9 @entity8 in @entity10 , @entity11 , judging from 12 different versions of a summary that emerged friday			1
@entity15 press secretary @entity14 has claimed that the intelligence community was solely responsible for drafting and revising the document - known now as the @entity10 ' talking points - and that editing by political appointees in the administration was limited to changing no more than two words			1
but @entity23 reported that the @entity24 had direct influence on the edits , and specifically requested the removal of references to the @entity30 - affiliated terror group @entity29 , and the deletion of references to @entity5 warnings in the months before the attack that terror attacks in the eastern @entity11 city were expected			1
' ' since april , ' the @entity5 assessment continued , ' there have been at least five other attacks against foreign interests in @entity10 by unidentified assailants , including the june attack against the @entity67 ambassador ’s convoy			2
we can not rule out the individuals has previously surveilled the @entity9 facilities , also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks			0
' @entity51 emailed @entity15 and intelligence officials , warning that the sentences ' could be abused by members [ of @entity76 ] to beat up the @entity24 for not paying attention to warnings , so why would we want to feed that either ? ' the words in question did not appear in the final version that was distributed to members of @entity76			1
unfortunately your browser does not support @entity84			0
in subsequent emails , the @entity5 stuck to its guns , retaining language that said , ' we do know that @entity90 extremists with ties to @entity30 participated in the attack , ' naming @entity29			1
the draft went on to specifically name the @entity30 - affiliated group named @entity29			0
after @entity51 objected again , saying that terrorist groups should not be named because the administration did not ' want to prejudice the investigation , ' a member of the @entity97 staff noted that ' the @entity101 did not have major concerns with the points and offered only a couple minor suggestions			1
' but @entity51 wrote that ' my building ' - likely referring to the @entity24 's top leadership - was still unhappy			2
ultimately , according to the emails @entity23 unearthed , deputy national security advisor @entity108 conceded that the @entity24 ’s concerns should be considered			2
@entity15 press secretary @entity14 told the press that the administration had a ' nonsubstantive ' role in editing the talking points , but new emails suggest otherwise @entity117 ambassador @entity116 told five different tv audiences one day after the talking points were finalized that the @entity10 attack was the product of a spontaneous protest over an anti-islam @entity124 video			1
the @entity5 had already determined , days before , that @entity90 terrorists were to blame @entity14 has briefed the press and insisted that ' the @entity5 drafted these talking points and redrafted these talking points			1
' ' the fact that there are inputs is always the case in a process like this , but the only edits made by anyone here at the @entity15 were stylistic and nonsubstantive			0
they corrected the description of the building or the facility in @entity10 from consulate to diplomatic facility and the like			0
' any input the @entity15 did have likely came at a meeting of @entity15 deputies four days after the attack			2
' the significant edits – deleting references to @entity30 and the @entity5 ’s warnings – came [ that ] @entity15 meeting , ' @entity23 reported on its blog			1
on the day following that meeting , @entity117 ambassador @entity116 appeared on five television talk shows and kept to the resulting line that a spontaneous protest – not a terror attack – was behind the destruction of the consulate and the loss of life			0
@entity51 , @entity23 adds , was not at the deputies ' meeting and did not prepare @entity162 for her interviews			2
@entity24 spokeswoman @entity51 's emails show that the agency , then headed by @entity166 , had a direct hand in altering the official story on the @entity10 terror attack inside the @entity15 press briefing room ( at right ) , @entity14 will brief the press today and is expected to face spiraling allegations that the @entity3 administration had a hand in editing the now - infamous @entity10 talking points that obscured the cause of a 2012 raid on the @entity9 @entity8 in that eastern @entity11 city ' we must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities , including those of the @entity24 , and we do n’t want to undermine the @entity101 investigation , ' @entity108 emailed the group reviewing the talking points			1
' we thus will work through the talking points tomorrow morning at the @entity188 meeting			0
' then - secretary of state @entity166 has become the focus of @entity191 political wrangling , with republicans on @entity193 accusing her of stonewalling a congressional investigation and adding accusations of an administration cover - up			0
@entity197 is likely to run for president in 2016 , @entity200 political analysts predict , making the performance of her agency a political football			0
the @entity24 did not respond to requests for comment			0
@entity9 ambassador to @entity11 @entity207 ( @entity208 ) and three other @entity9 personnel died in the @entity10 attack , now understood to have been carried out by @entity29 and other @entity30 - linked groups the @entity9 @entity8 was left in ruins after terrorists ' pre-set mortars rained down and rocket - propelled grenades caused fires and explosions on sept. 11 , 2012 but @entity197 's tenure at @entity24 will continue to be a source of controversy			1
a career diplomat who was second - in - command in @entity11 on the night of the @entity10 attack testified before @entity76 on wednesday that a commando team was turned back from flying from @entity224 to @entity10 after the @entity24 intervened			0
@entity225 quoted an @entity227 colonel telling him over the phone that ' this is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military			0

@entity24 spokeswoman @entity51 objected to the @entity5 's summary , which concluded that terrorists killed four @entity9
attack came in the weeks before the 2012 *election* , as president @entity3 was campaigning on the *strength* of having *defeated* @entity30
@entity15 press secretary @entity14 has denied that the administration had a substantial hand in changing the official story
@entity23 reports that the administration 's line was edited 12 times
