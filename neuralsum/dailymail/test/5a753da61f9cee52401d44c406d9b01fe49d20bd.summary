a @entity1 man is lucky to be alive after a lawn mower shot a three - and - a - half inch metal wire up his nose and into his head			1
@entity6 , 34 , of @entity7 was mowing his lawn while at his family home last sunday when he thought a rock hit him in the face not realizing it was actually a metal fence wire			2
dr @entity12 , who removed the wire which was as thick as a heavy - duty nail , said that it miraculously dodged all of @entity6 's important nerves and arteries			1
@entity6 , 34 , of @entity7 was mowing his lawn on april 19 when the rusty metal wire entered his left nostril and was lodged in his sinus cavity ( above the ct scan showing the wire inside @entity6 's head ) @entity6 ( left ) thought a rock had struck him in the face but after going to @entity28 a scan revealed it was a three - and - a - half - inch metal fence wire ' it threw me back a little bit and it hurt real bad , ' @entity6 told the @entity32			1
' i felt my face but i did n't feel any disfiguring or anything			0
i saw blood , so i knew i got a bloody nose			0
' after nearly 15 minutes following the incident , he and his fiancee @entity39 decided for him to go to @entity28 for treatment			0
a ct scan revealed the metal wire had been shot up his left nostril and was lodged in @entity6 's sinus cavity beneath his eye socket and next to his jaw hinge			1
' had it gone straight up his nose at the rate it was traveling , it could have gone inside his brain , ' @entity39 told the @entity32			0
dr @entity12 removed the wire with a simple sinus surgery which took 20 minutes and entailed making an incision on @entity6 's upper lip			1
' it was about a nine - centimeter long , rusty piece of metal that went all the way up to his skull base , and it pretty much dodged everything , ' dr @entity12 told the @entity32			1
' once the scan showed that , my job was pretty easy			0
' ' he should n't have any long - term effects , ' he added			1
' basically , it was a sinus surgery			2
the problem is this was a rusty piece of metal			0
' dr @entity12 removed the wire in a 20 - minute sinus surgery ( left the wire being removed from @entity6 's nose )			1
dr @entity12 made an incision on @entity6 's upper lip during the surgery ( pictured right the incision ) the rusty wire ( above the wire after it was removed during surgery ) dodged all of @entity6 's important nerves and arteries , according to dr @entity12 following the surgery , @entity6 shared on @entity90 that he was grateful to be alive as he retold his account of what happened the day before			1
' just woke up at memorial hospital			0
much of yesterday is kind of a blur and lots of it i just do n't remember , ' he wrote			0
' always wear protective gear for your face when cutting grass ! ! ! i thought a rock or something flew out and hit me , it felt like getting shot in the face			0
' cat scan determined it to be a metallic object in my sinus cavity			2
' @entity6 ( above ) is taking antibiotics to prevent infection and said he plans to find someone else to mow his lawn ' i 'm grateful to be alive			1
several doctors were completely amazed at what had happened to me and stressed how lucky i really am , ' he continued			0
' the metal had somehow made its way through a tangle of really important nerves and arteries and finally rested about a millimeter from both carotid artery and my jugular vein			2
' guess it just wasnt my time yet			0
' the metal wire was sent to a pathology lab and @entity6 is taking antibiotics to prevent infection			1
he was back at work by wednesday , albeit a little bruised			0
