sunday marks @entity1 's first real test since he took over as the manager of @entity3			1
in the absence of @entity6 football , he has avoided meeting any of the leading @entity9 clubs			0
and incredibly , given @entity3 's poor start to the season , they have not played any of last season 's top four in the @entity14 yet			1
of course , that 's all about to change with sunday 's game against @entity17 , the derby at @entity18 next month and a visit to @entity20 in four weeks			1
by then we 'll know if the small signs of improvement recently at @entity3 are genuine			2
although they are looking better offensively than last season , it is not the @entity3 of old yet			2
you used to fear that red tide of players coming at you at @entity30 and i have n't seen that under @entity32			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity3 's @entity34 ( centre ) celebrates scoring a late equaliser against @entity37 @entity17 players including @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 celebrate the @entity43 's goal against @entity44 @entity45 is still finding his feet at @entity3 after joining on loan from @entity48 in the summer plenty has been said about @entity51 's passing but there 's a part of his game that has been overlooked and which is just as important to @entity17			1
that 's the runs he makes for his team - mates on the overlap to get beyond the player in possession and provide an option in a position which hurts the opposition			2
he 'll go round the outside of his team - mate , bursting a gut to do it , and create a chance just by the timing of his run			0
some players can do that 12 times in a game and never affect it			0
but he can smell the opportunities in the final third , when it 's right to go and better to stay			0
he reads the situation so well , his timing is perfect and he knows when it 's going to hurt			0
on at least five occasions this season i 've seen him do it to create a goal			0
@entity51 might have signed for @entity3 last year			2
today may be the day they regret missing out on him			0
he has the players to do it			0
even with @entity92 suspended , there 's @entity93 , @entity45 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 with @entity97 coming into contention after his goal and performance in the second half at @entity37			1
but so far they have n't been as aggressive or ruthless as sir @entity104 's teams			2
that 's what i 'm waiting to see from them today			0
given @entity3 do n't really have the players to be cautious , it would not surprise me if @entity32 goes with a diamond formation , with two up front , so he can get @entity113 , @entity45 , @entity114 and @entity94 into the team			1
with @entity116 very doubtful and @entity117 injured , @entity17 may have to start with @entity40 or @entity118 up front , and if they do , this is @entity3 's opportunity to take the game to @entity17			1
sunday will give us a good idea just how good this @entity3 team can be , because @entity17 have a back four and a midfield that can soak up pressure , deal with crosses and cope with neat football being played in front of them			1
when you look at @entity135 's record away from home in big games , he often likes to counter attack			1
if @entity116 and @entity117 are out , that will make him more inclined to play that way			0
and with a five - point lead , he can afford to play it cagey and look to break on @entity3			1
@entity143 , pictured in action against @entity44 , could be key to @entity17 's counter-attacking style @entity135 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) will go head - to - head at @entity30 on sunday afternoon @entity147 ( left ) , pictured tussling with @entity148 ( right ) , will need to be at the top of his game @entity3 's achilles heel is obviously their defence			1
should @entity40 play , even at the age of 36 , you could imagine him bullying their centre - halves , especially @entity156			0
but @entity156 ca n't allow that to happen			0
at 22 years of age , he 's no longer an inexperienced player and he must dominate a centre - forward , even someone like @entity40			2
if @entity32 chooses the diamond formation , @entity3 will have to be extremely co-ordinated behind the front two to defend , especially given the width @entity17 could have in @entity143 , @entity118 — if he 's playing wide — or @entity163			1
at the moment with @entity3 , you feel 75 per cent of their game is focused on how to play well going forward			2
with the defence it feels as though it 's a case of : ' we 'll play a back four and hope they can cope with it			2
' in between games , @entity32 will obviously be working hard to remedy that and drilling their defensive shape			0
but @entity135 's teams are the masters at exploiting space on the break and with @entity41 , @entity143 and @entity51 they have the ideal players to do that			1
@entity94 , pictured in action against @entity183 , looks set to start in the absence of the suspended @entity92 ex-chelsea midfielder @entity94 ( right ) will have a point to prove against his former boss @entity135 ( left ) @entity94 pumps his fist after scoring in @entity3 's 4 - 0 win against @entity183 at @entity30 in september @entity34 has a key job to do in shielding the defence			1
he 's a lovely distributor of the ball , he keeps his passing very simple but he has a screening job to do , too			0
but @entity114 , @entity195 and @entity94 have their part to play as well			2
the whole team will have to work as a unit and for @entity94 , playing against the manager who sold him a year ago , it 's an opportunity to prove a point			1
you would imagine that part of the reason why @entity135 was willing to sell him was his weakness in contributing to defensive duties , so the @entity209 will not lack motivation			0
there is a lot more to come from him			0
he 's a talented player but so far he has n't found the consistency he had at @entity17 in his first two seasons			1
there are great performances in him but they have been few and far between at @entity3			0
i 'm intrigued as to how it plays out			0
given the make - up of the teams i 'm expecting goals rather than a tight game			1
when the two biggest personalities managing in the @entity14 collide , you would be right to expect something special			0
@entity95 ( centre ) will be looking to continue his fine start to life at @entity30 against @entity17 like our @entity3 facebook page here .			1

@entity14 leaders @entity17 take on @entity3 on sunday
the @entity238 ' leaky defence is a big concern against @entity240
but @entity1 's diamond formation could be exploited too
@entity94 will want to get one over his former manager @entity135
there could be goals *galore* at @entity30 given the make - up of the teams
