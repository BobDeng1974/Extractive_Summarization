at a time when @entity4 manager @entity3 badly needs a speedy start to this @entity7 campaign , his captain tried to lift the mood by summoning the spirit of a flying @entity10			1
@entity11 was discussing the destructive qualities of @entity13 when he likened him to @entity14 , and told how he had taken aside @entity4 's teen star to study clips of the former @entity18 and @entity19 striker			1
' before the @entity21 i showed him videos of @entity14 because he reminded me of him , ' said @entity11			1
' he has the potential to be as good as @entity14			1
bright future : @entity13 was @entity4 's best player during wednesday 's 1 - 0 win against @entity26 similar : @entity11 believes @entity13 ( left ) shares some of the same qualities as @entity14 ( right ) captain material : @entity11 ( left ) has admitted showing @entity13 videos of @entity31 before the @entity21 danger man : @entity14 scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas 63.6 % - @entity4 ’s win percentage against @entity38			1
they have won 14 of their 22 contests , drawing five and losing just three			0
they are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the @entity42			0
1 - good news for @entity3 — @entity4 have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home			1
192 - some bad news for @entity3			1
in 192 minutes of football , @entity4 have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot			1
3 - @entity11 looks a good bet to score at any time			1
the @entity4 captain has scored in each of his three appearances against @entity38			1
2 - only two players have survived from @entity4 ’s last game against the @entity42 — @entity59 and @entity60 both started that match at @entity62 in 2011			1
17 - @entity4 like playing in @entity63			1
they have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game			0
that includes an 8 - 1 victory in 1963			0
9 - @entity38 have not lost at home for nine matches			1
their last defeat on home soil came against @entity76 in may 2012			0
@entity77 ' @entity13 is a fantastic and quite an unusual player			1
he can play right across the front line , out wide			0
although he 's a small lad , he 's really strong			0
the potential he 's shown is incredible			2
he 'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and , unfortunately , for @entity81			0
' @entity14 had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct			1
@entity13 arguably has a greater range of weaponry , but is still only 19 and developing			1
he is , nevertheless , the brightest spark in @entity3 's @entity88 gloom			2
at the @entity89 here on monday night , @entity4 will look to him for creativity			1
four years ago , @entity92 's @entity4 arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances			2
the @entity21 in @entity95 had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from @entity62			2
@entity11 was mired in front - page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3 - 1 win , which put @entity92 in control on the road to @entity105			2
@entity3 could do with the same on his return to @entity38 , where he is still feted for taking them to their first @entity21 finals in 28 years in 1994			1
' winning this game does not make a great team in 2016 , ' said @entity3			2
' neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016			0
we are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage			0
we have to make sure after these next two years we are very , very strong			0
' wednesday 's 1 - 0 home win over @entity26 was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in @entity121			0
it is nearly two years since @entity4 actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the @entity21			1
@entity125 moment : @entity11 scores from the penalty spot in @entity4 's 1 - 0 win against @entity26 challenges : @entity3 will be without @entity131 and potentially @entity132 on monday preparation : @entity3 leads his players in training at @entity89 in @entity63 on sunday afternoon as ever , injuries have eaten into the squad			1
striker @entity131 's withdrawal on friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie @entity139 or back - up keeper @entity140 but at least @entity3 has @entity141 ready to step in			1
if @entity132 is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because @entity4 have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge @entity3 's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions			1
' very few are classic number nines , or tens or sevens or fours or sixes , ' @entity3 said			2
' they 're not stereotyped			0
they 're capable of different things			2
i 've seen the under - 20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which @entity162 football is changing			0
i think back to the academy at @entity164 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different			2
' it 's difficult to look at an @entity4 team at any level and find a player who is not pacey , even a centre back			2
in the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play			2
' by the same token , he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable			2
' the players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012 , ' the manager added			0
' we were a passing team			0
now we 're a dribbling team			0
we 're not a long - ball team any more			0
we try to pass through the midfield and create openings			0
we 're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better			0
' @entity3 refuted the accompanying theory that a 67 - year - old coach might not be best - equipped to coach such modern footballers			2
stepping up : @entity141 looks set to start for the @entity4 after an injury to @entity131 settling : @entity13 ( left ) and his team - mates get used to the pitch on which they will face @entity38 all smiles : @entity18 team - mates @entity198 ( left ) and @entity60 ( centre ) share a joke in training @entity4 will play on a monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face @entity38 next week			1
@entity203 have spread out the qualification matches for @entity7 as part of their new ‘ @entity207 ’ concept , with games taking place from thursday to tuesday			2
that means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying			0
the final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for october 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously			0
@entity4 have only played nine monday games since 1966 , but prior to that they were a regular occurrence			1
between 1880 and 1927 , @entity4 played @entity219 alone 33 times on a monday			1
the good news for @entity4 fans is their record is good ... @entity224			1
.7 win % ... 67.3 ' either you 're a good coach or you 're not , ' he rapped back			0
' either you know how to put your approach across or not			0
you just try to make sure the best players are in important places , and those around them complement them			0
that 's how it 's been since i started			0
i do n't see any difference at all now to that			0
' and so , to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy @entity13 , who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against @entity26 , after @entity11 had been replaced			1
does he keep him there or move him back to the wing , albeit with freedom to float ? the team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at @entity251 and , in the absence of @entity131 , @entity4 can more easily revert to 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 without threatening @entity11 's place			1
' there are options , ' said @entity3			2
' it 's up to us to perform and play well			0
is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0 - 0 ? no , i 'd say it is n't			0

@entity13 has the potential to be as good as @entity14 according to @entity11
the @entity267 striker showed @entity13 videos of the @entity10 prior to the @entity21
@entity14 *enjoyed* a *glittering* career with the likes of @entity18 , @entity272 and @entity273 before retiring in 2009
@entity3 could be without @entity132 on monday
the @entity4 begin their @entity7 qualifying campaign against @entity38 at @entity89 in @entity63
@entity3 believes his squad is full of *versatile* players capable of playing in different positions
