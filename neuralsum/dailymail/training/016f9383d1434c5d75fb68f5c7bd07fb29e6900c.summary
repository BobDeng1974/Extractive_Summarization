@entity1 health officials are warning a widespread drug used to treat gonorrhea has been rendered ineffective , leaving only one drug option to defend against one of the most rampant sexually transmitted diseases in @entity1			1
the bacteria that causes gonorrhea has become resistant to antibiotics used to treat the condition , according to a new report from the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
the @entity11 's announcement echos concerns raised by the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) earlier this summer , that sounded the alarm that a widespread treatment for the disease was not longer viable			2
dwindling treatment options : neisseria gonorrhoeae , the bacteria that causes gonorrhea , has become resistant to antibiotics used to treat the condition , according to a new report from the @entity11 roughly 700,000 cases of gonorrhea occur in the @entity1 annually , of the estimated 106 million people each year who are infected worldwide			1
in the @entity1 , it is most prevalent among @entity28 and sexually active teenagers and young adults			1
since 2007 , the @entity32 - based agency has recommended cefixime , an oral medication under the brand name @entity36 , as the first line of defense to combat the spread of the infection			2
but now the @entity11 believes cefixime is not adequately treating the condition and patients can no longer rely on it as a viable option			0
the @entity11 will review potential treatment alternatives but fear research and development for gonorrhea drugs will be a tough sell to pharmaceutical companies with cefixime no longer being recommended , only one treatment is left available to those suffering from the disease , commonly referred to as ' @entity54			1
' instead , patients with the condition are advised to receive an antibiotic delivered by injection , known as ceftriaxone			0
gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium @entity62 gonorrhea and spreads through sexual activity , but has been known at times to spread from an untreated mother to her baby during childbirth			1
the sexually transmitted disease ( @entity69 ) can grow easily in the warm , moist areas of the reproductive tract , including the cervix , uterus , and fallopian tubes in women , and in the urethra in both women and men			0
those infected , particularly women , can show no symptoms			1
symptoms for men include a burning sensation when urinating , or colored discharge			0
complications from the disease can include infertility and chronic pelvic pain in women and in men			0
in most patients , a urine test can be used to test for gonorrhea			1
this change could become problematic because the shot is not typically stocked in a doctor 's office and usually only found in @entity69 clinics			0
patients also tend to prefer pills to injections and might be less likely to seek the injectable option			0
with only one treatment deemed effective , health officials also fear the infection will eventually develop a resistance against ceftriaxone			0
' gonorrhea is becoming a major public health challenge , due to the high incidence of infections accompanied by dwindling treatment options , ' dr @entity106 , from the @entity107 at @entity14 , said in a statement in june			2
' the available data only shows the tip of the iceberg			0
without adequate surveillance we wo n't know the extent of resistance to gonorrhea and without research into new antimicrobial agents , there could soon be no effective treatment for patients			2
' the @entity11 and @entity127 will review potential treatment alternatives but fear research and development for gonorrhea drugs will be a tough sell to pharmaceutical companies .			2
