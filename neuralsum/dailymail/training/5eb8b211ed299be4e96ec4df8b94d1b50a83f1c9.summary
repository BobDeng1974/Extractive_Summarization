the @entity10 said @entity6 rebels did not have the means to carry out an outrage on the scale seen in the @entity16 suburbs on wednesday – leaving tyrant @entity17 firmly in the dock			1
amid signs that the @entity21 is rapidly moving closer to intervention in @entity6 ’s bloody civil war , @entity19 ordered @entity2 intelligence agencies to ‘ urgently gather ’ evidence about the attack , which killed up to 1,700 civilians , many of them women and children			1
as @entity50 called for a ‘ reaction of force ’ , @entity48 and @entity49 were weighing the options for responding to the massacre			0

@entity92 is expected to call world leaders from his holiday in @entity95 to discuss the crisis			0
@entity98 sources insisted that there had still been no decision over whether @entity81 should arm @entity6 ’s rebels			2
but a source acknowledged the massacre would reignite the debate about intervention			0
‘ the more attacks of this sort there are , and the bigger they are , the more we have to look again at the options , ’ the source said			0
@entity50 led the calls for the @entity21 to wade into the conflict			0
foreign minister @entity114 said that if there is proof of a chemical weapons attack by the regime ‘ we need a reaction by the international community ... a reaction of force ’			1

@entity81 called for @entity127 chemical weapons inspectors – already in @entity6 – to be given urgent access to the site of the deadly toxic attack			1
a government source said : ‘ if the @entity17 regime really wants to demonstrate it had nothing to do with this , they have a @entity127 investigation team 20 minutes away			1
the fact they are not being allowed access fuels concerns about what has happened			0
’ @entity144 secretary general @entity143 also called for inspectors to be allowed in ‘ without delay ’			2
but the @entity17 regime appeared determined to resist the calls , with @entity6 officials warning the safety of inspectors can not be guaranteed in areas that have been the scene of frequent brutal clashes since the conflict began in march 2011			2
@entity154 , @entity17 ’s strongest ally , also called on @entity6 to allow the inspectors in – but put the blame on rebels , claiming that victims were killed by ‘ a homemade rocket loaded with an unidentified chemical agent ’ and saying the attack was likely to be a provocation by opposition forces			1
former foreign secretary sir @entity165 said the images of rows of dead children underlined the case for arming @entity6 ’s rebels			2
‘ if it is proven – which seems likely – that this was a serious chemical attack then it indicates they are using weapons of mass destruction , ’ he said			2
‘ that is a red line which must lead to a serious response			0

if @entity154 and @entity255 continue to behave disgracefully by blocking action at @entity127 level then it falls to others , such as the @entity2 and us , to do what we can			1
as a starting point we now have to provide military support for the insurgents			0
we can not sit on the sidelines and allow this to happen			0
