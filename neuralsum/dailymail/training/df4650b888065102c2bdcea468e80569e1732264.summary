even before voters went to the polls to decide who would be the next senator of @entity5 , the @entity0 was preparing for a run - off situation that would require dozens of campaign operatives to spend the next month in the state campaigning for @entity10 @entity9			1
by election night the number of @entity0 staffers airlifting into the state on wednesday had ballooned to 300 people as @entity5 officials confirmed that a second election would be held on dec. 6			1
neither @entity9 , the top @entity10 in the race , nor sitting sen. @entity19 were able to beat back a cadre of other candidates challenging them for the seat and reach the state 's required 50 percent mark			1
help is on the way ! the @entity10 announced tonight that it would send 300 operatives to @entity5 to help congressman @entity9 in the @entity29 runoff incumbent sen. @entity19 acknowledges supporters at her election night headquarters in @entity33			1
@entity19 immediately began attacking her opponent on tuesday night after she learned that they would again face off next month as a result of the state 's jungle primary @entity5 's jungle general elections allows for any candidate who fulfills state requirements to appear on the ballot			1
as a result eight candidates were allowed compete in today 's election , including four @entity46 and three @entity10			1
the only candidate to garner more than one percent of the vote , however , besides frontrunners @entity9 and @entity19 , was @entity10 @entity50 , who siphoned off just over 14 percent of the vote from fellow @entity52			1
with @entity50 and the other candidates gone from the race , polls predict that @entity9 with sail to victory in next month 's redo election			1
@entity59 were already preparing for a run - off scenario in @entity5 for weeks before @entity61 and planned to send in staffers of all types to aid @entity9 , who currently represents @entity5 in @entity64			2
@entity0 chairman @entity65 confirmed on tuesday that the national party had already locked down hotels for the staffers for the duration of the ongoing campaign season			1
@entity65 made the announcement from the jam - packed lobby of the party committee 's @entity74 headquarters on the edge of @entity77			0
at the time @entity10 were still waiting on the results in several key states that would determine whether their party would take over the @entity29 , including @entity82 , which also called for a run off if no candidate topped 50 percent			2
in the end , the @entity10 came out on top on tuesday , gaining just enough seats to take control of the @entity29 just after 11 p.m. @entity19 needed to win 50 percent of the vote to keep her seat outright			1
now she will have to square of again against @entity9 on dec. 6			1
polls give @entity9 the upper hand blocks away the @entity93 was mum as the majority and the last two years of president @entity97 's term slipped out of the party 's reach			2
the political organization declined to have a victory party this year , likely in anticipation of a @entity10 wave and its chairman did not hold a briefing with the press			2
a request for comment on the results of @entity19 's race was not immediately returned by the @entity93 , either			2
