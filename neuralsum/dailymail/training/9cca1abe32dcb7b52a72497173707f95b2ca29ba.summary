by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 09:50 est , 22 july 2012 last month , under the glare of multiple flashbulbs , the world was told : ' @entity4 is back			2
' with forced smiles and uncomfortable hugs , five women were shuffled into position by their pushy pr teams and ordered to ooze the youthful happiness and energy that once made them the biggest girl band in the world			2
become the legend : the game follows @entity17 as she transforms into a hunter but the eyes never lie , and it was clear for most to see that the once iconic faces did n’t wannabe there			1
they just did n’t want to zig - a - zig - a anymore			2
( one in particular made that abundantly clear with a trademark pout			0
) it seemed that @entity4 had run out and was in desperate need of the @entity28			0
sixteen years ago , when @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity30 , @entity31 and whatsherface , had pretty much taken over the planet - another icon was born			2
softly spoken , athletic and smart , she was touring the globe herself - unearthing ancient treasures in @entity38 , killing crocodiles in the @entity40 and squeezing off rounds from her @entity43 handgun like @entity44 hooked up to a @entity46 drip			2
she took @entity4 up a few notches			0
in fact , she made it a force to be reckoned with			0
not @entity52 , not @entity53 ... and any suggestions of spicing up her life would be met with a firm uppercut followed by a devastating roundhouse			0
and just like @entity58 , @entity17 is due to make a highly - anticipated comeback			1
so , is her makeover a canny , well - crafted upgrade or a tired attempt to re-tie frayed puppet strings and dust off old dance routines ? smoking hot : @entity17 's had a makeover and looks great well , unlike the characters in @entity67 , the heroine of @entity69 has grown in strength , agility and beauty			1
i was invited to a hands - on with the new game , which is n’t out until next year , yet it was still a tantalising look at what fans can expect from the return of @entity17			1
set as a prequel to the original games , the star of the show is a young 21 - year - old who is out to prove herself to the world after graduating from university			1
but all chaos breaks loose when the ship she is travelling on breaks up and @entity17 is washed - up on a mysterious island			1
all alone , she desperately searches for her mentor captain @entity90 and any other survivors of the shipwreck			0
the early plot sets the tone for what is bound to be a dark tale			0
@entity17 has to sneak past some gun - toting gang on the island who are not afraid to kill anyone in their path			1
it ’s a gritty angle which tells the story of how @entity17 goes from a frightened young woman to a hardened survivor			1
i played through one of the opening levels of the game , which acts a tutorial for @entity113 ’s new masterpiece			0
visually the game is inspired , with jungle greenery shining through and high - res raindrops dampening lost @entity17 ’s spirits			1
her facial interpretation is also meticulous , with life - like qualities adding to her vulnerable yet plucky character			1
every hair , scratch and tear is beautifully rendered and results in a more human @entity17 , like you ’ve never seen before			1
plus , she 's voiced by actress @entity125 - best known for playing @entity126 in @entity128 tv movie , @entity129 and @entity126			1
bow selecta : never mind guns , @entity17 has to learn to use a bow and arrow first the action - adventure sees a lot of physical running , jumping and climbing - just like the original games			1
however , there seems to be less of the acrobatics which @entity17 was famed for years ago			1
after finding a bow & arrow , @entity17 goes hunting			1
the shooting mechanics work well as you draw an aim on a poor deer oblivious to the little hunter			0
@entity17 also fends off three or four nasty wolves which leap out of the trees at her after she gets stuck in an animal trap			2
your main objective is highlighted when you jump into @entity153 vision			0
it ’s similar to @entity155 in @entity156 but only highlights clues and tips for a moment instead of being on constantly			0
campsites can be found jotted around the open world environment and here you can save your progress and upgrade weapons			0
these @entity163 also allow you to customise @entity17 ’s skill tree			2
sadly , there was a distinct lack of puzzles which were such a vital part of the original games but fingers crossed these will become more apparent as the title goes on			0
i had a brief look at some later levels too which involved a lot of shooting , ducking and diving			0
as well as stealthy takedowns , @entity17 later learns how explosive barrels can be just as effective and a headshot			2
hanging around : set pieces break up the gameplay nicely - and look superb , too from the looks of things , @entity69 is bang on track to make @entity17 ’s return a successful one which stays true to the roots of this gaming icon			1
too often we have seen original ideas , concepts and characters tampered with years down the line in a desperate bid to make money			0
most of the time these cobbled together comebacks wilt and fade after being reintroduced to the spotlight			0
but not @entity17 ... under this intense glare she shines even brighter than before			2
follow @entity0 on @entity200 : @ @entity201 and on @entity202 : @entity203			0
