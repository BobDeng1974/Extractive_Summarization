when @entity0 started to build his reputation in @entity3 football with @entity4 in 2001 , much was expected from a powerful but nimble @entity6 striker			1
but 14 years on as the 31 - year - old visited the @entity11 giants ' training camp in @entity12 , that lean physique has obviously given way to a more significant presence			1
the former @entity16 and @entity17 striker , most recently with @entity18 in @entity19 , was sacked as manager of @entity21 in the summer and seems to have given up on keeping himself in shape			1
@entity0 , still just 31 , posted a picture on @entity25 on friday as he visited his former club @entity4 's training camp @entity0 chats with @entity4 manager @entity28 as he watches training in @entity12 @entity0 celebrates with manager @entity30 and team - mates after helping @entity4 claim the @entity32 in 2002 1999 - 00 : @entity21 ( 4 apps 3 goals ) 2000 - 01 : @entity37 ( 21 apps 11 goals ) 2001 - 03 : @entity4 ( 40 apps 23 goals ) 2003 : @entity40 ( 8 apps 4 goals ) 2003 – 04 : @entity45 ( 33 apps 14 goals ) 2004 – 06 : @entity46 ( 8 apps 0 goals ) 2005 - 06 : @entity48 ( 36 apps 14 gls ) 2006 – 07 : @entity16 ( 12 apps 5 goals ) 2007 – 10 : @entity17 ( 25 apps 8 goals ) 2009 : @entity54 ( 12 apps 2 goals ) 2009 – 2010 : @entity56 ( 15 apps 1 goal ) 2010 : @entity59 ( 9 apps 0 goals ) 2010 : @entity62 ( 5 apps 3 goals ) 2011 - 12 : @entity21 ( 4 apps 3 goals ) 2012 – 13 : @entity18 ( 1 app 0 goals ) @entity0 retired from football at the age of just 30 after a career that failed to live up to early promise			1
he impressed as a teenager in @entity74 before progressing further with @entity37 and @entity4 in @entity75			2
the target man scored 23 goals in 40 games in the @entity32			0
he was then snapped up by @entity45 in an £ 8million deal , only to be outshone by @entity80 in @entity81			0
but that did n't stop @entity84 sides declaring their interest			0
@entity0 struggled in @entity46 for two years before @entity16 finally brought him to @entity19			1
still a youngster , there was hope the forward could excel in a physical league			0
his scoring record at @entity92 suggested he could perform at the highest level , so when @entity16 revealed they were willing to sell @entity17 were happy to take @entity0 off their hands			1
but eight goals in two seasons in the @entity98 along with problems off the pitch did nothing for his reputation , nor did just two more goals during a short spell at @entity54			0
@entity0 impressed at @entity16 on loan , with @entity108 deciding to sign the @entity6 permanently his scoring record suggested he could be a hit in a physical league , with @entity17 next to bring him in but @entity0 's career deteriorated after a spell in the @entity98 , he failed to get on target at @entity59 ( right ) the striker celebrates scoring one of his two goals for @entity54 , the opener against @entity119 in 2009 an exile of sorts then followed for the @entity6 back in his home country , but it was n't long until @entity59 welcomed him back to the @entity84			1
@entity125 once quipped that @entity127 ' striker @entity126 was overweight and so would n't have been overjoyed with a now weary @entity0 , who did n't score in his nine league appearances			0
@entity18 were the latest team to welcome him but he played just one @entity130 game in 2012 , while his international career also ended in tatters			2
@entity0 often fell out with coaches and was even banned for six months after arguing on the pitch with fellow former @entity54 striker @entity135			2
@entity74 went on to win the @entity136 without him in 2006			0
at the age of just 31 , @entity0 should still be excelling in one of @entity75 's top leagues			2
he also struggled to fulfill his potential internationally , falling out with many @entity74 head coaches			0

@entity0 , still just 31 , has seen his *fitness* levels deteriorate in recent years
the @entity6 visited @entity4 's training camp in @entity12 on friday
he arrived in @entity19 full of promise when @entity16 signed him
but @entity0 struggled at @entity17 , @entity54 , @entity59 and @entity18
*controversial* international career and sacked as @entity21 boss last year
