we ’ve all been there – accidentally swearing in front of a child before realising what we ’ve done			0
but a new study by dr. @entity6 , a psychologist and expert in swearing , says our efforts to keep our language clean might be futile			1
he claims that kids pick up bad language from all over the place and there ’s not much you can do about it			1
do n't look so surprised : a new study suggests kids are going to learn taboo language whether you like it or not dr. @entity6 , of the @entity22 , made the claims in his paper @entity25 ’s @entity24 in the @entity27			1
he discovered that by the age of six , children have a pretty broad vocabulary of swear words			2
‘ by the time children enter school they have the rudiments of adult swearing , ’ dr. @entity6 writes , ‘ although children and adults differ in their assessments of the inappropriateness of mild taboo words			1
’ between the ages of one and two , dr. @entity6 found boys knew an average of six taboo words , and girls eight			1
by the age of six boys knew 34 , while girls were aware of 21			0
our attempts to hide swear words are apparently in vain , but it does help to give the children context for the words			2
namely they are more aware of the social implications of such words , and are thus more likely to remember them , even if they do n’t utter them all the time			0
adults children ( ages one to 12 ) f * * * 613 s * * * 587 ( oh my ) god 421 hell 242 ( @entity71 ) ( @entity71 ) 178 damn 146 ass 132 suck ( s ) 99 goddamn 79 b * tch 65 s * * * 116 f * * * 103 ( oh my ) god 102 stupid 82 damn 51 jerk 42 suck ( s ) 34 crap 32 hell 32 b * tch 31 to obtain the data , one man and six women with training in research methods and statistics who had frequent contact with children monitored their language over a calendar year			1
they were insutructed to record all taboo utterances occurring spontaneously in context , such as in day care , at school or at a sporting event			0
utterances were to include offensive words and insults or name calling			0
they also noted the ages and gender of each child that spoke a taboo word or phrase			0
the same study was also done for adults			2
in total , 3,190 utterances from adults were recorded - by comparison , children spoke offensive words or phrases 1,187 times , with boys resorting to swear words more often than girls			1
for three to four - year - olds , words ranged from the tenth popular ‘ poophead ’ ( heard nine times ) to ‘ jerk ’ at the top end , which was heard 18 times			0
as they got older the words became more ‘ offensive ’ with 11 to 12 year - olds preferring words such as ' f * * * ' and 's * * * '			2
this relates to the second study , where adults and children were asked to rate how ‘ bad ’ they thought certain words were			1
this ranged from 100 per cent of children thinking ‘ asshole ’ was a bad word to only 68 per cent thinking ‘ @entity71 ’ had negative connotations			2
for adults , ‘ bitch ’ topped the list with 100 per cent thinking it was bad , while only 44 per cent deemed ‘ dork ’ offensive			2
in the study it was pointed out that swearing need not always carry negative connotations - it can be useful in some instances , such as expressing happiness or surprise ‘ as soon as kids start talking , they pick up this kind of language , ’ dr. @entity6 told @entity150			1
‘ they ’re like little language vacuum cleaners , so they repeat what they hear			0
’ dr. @entity6 , however , argues that swearing in front of children is not necessarily a bad thing			1
s * * * 5			0
stupid ( * note : some words were omitted at the request of parents and caregivers ) he says it helps them to learn about how adults handle emotion , showing them swearing is just a part of being angry or happy , for example			2
it is the parent ’s job to teach their children the nuances of swearing , and let them know what is and is n’t appropriate in certain situations			0
‘ expect your kids to be angry and frustrated at times , and sometimes this language seems kind of natural to them , ’ he says			0
but dr. @entity6 also views our ability to swear as a beneficial trait in humans			1
‘ a lot of times you do n’t get to the argument about the positive uses of these [ words ] , ’ he adds			0
‘ their use in humour , their use in bonding , their use as a relief from pain or venting or frustration – i look at this as an evolutionary advantage			0
‘ why would we have this language ? it must do something for us			0
' dr. @entity6 , however , does note some limitations in his study			1
‘ a larger pool of adults and children is necessary for analysis of parent - child or caregiver - child gender interactions , ’ he writes			0
he also adds that ‘ a significant limitation here and in taboo language in general is that the sampling is limited to primarily white , middle - class speakers			1
’ perhaps a bar of soap is n't the answer : dr. @entity6 says we should teach children when and where it is appropriate to use certain words , and how they can be said in certain context			1

dr. @entity6 's new study monitored swearing in children and adults
he found that kids from one to 12 years old picked up taboo language
this was despite the efforts of adults in some cases to *protect* them
he says we need to educate children more about the uses of such words
but he says we should also *highlight* that swearing is n't always so bad
