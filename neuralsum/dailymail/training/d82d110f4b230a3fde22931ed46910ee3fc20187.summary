unlike today , just two bridges are seen to span the @entity45 and @entity46			1
the fascinating map was created by 18th century cartographer @entity31 , and at the time was the most detailed map of @entity3 ever made , as well as being the first large - scale map of the city to be made after it was devastated by fire in 1666			1
@entity31 , a @entity49 who had moved to @entity50 from @entity51 with his parents in 1709 , began the painstaking project in 1737 and did not finish it until 1746			0
river crossings : the map shows how during the @entity58 era there were just two bridges across the @entity59 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) multiplied : a look at a map from today shows how the two bridges have been joined by a further nine , making it easier for @entity62 to cross the river in detail : @entity46 crosses to the old @entity41 ( left ) , destroyed by fire in 1834 and replaced by the @entity67 we know today ( right ) it was created to a scale of one mile to 26 inches and made using a ground - level survey with the help of a compass and a chain , before the details were engraved onto 24 separate copper plates which were then coated in ink and pressed onto paper			1
the 6.5ft tall map provides a snapshot into what @entity3 looked like in the @entity58 era and is now considered among the most important @entity84 maps ever made			1
' you really have to stand in front of it to understand the scale of it - it is huge , ' said @entity93 's map expert @entity91			1
' it 's basically the first large - scale map of @entity3 made after the @entity27			1
historically it 's a really interesting snapshot of how @entity58 @entity3 looked			2
the way things were : @entity20 is shown on the map as a country estate surrounded by open fields official residence : other buildings have crept closer to the home of the @entity84 monarchy , but the green spaces of @entity107 and @entity108 remain ' it is a wonderful document to study - @entity110 has open fields to the north of it and there are dozens of boats on the @entity116			2
it 's amazing to see how far we have come in just a few hundred years			0
' the scale is 26 inches to a mile so the level of detail is incredible			0
' @entity31 was a @entity49 who came to @entity3 in the early 17th century and was a bit of a jack of all trades when it came to maps - he was a surveyor , publisher and engraver			2
' this map was quite an expensive undertaking and took nine years to complete			2
it was far too big to print in one go and so it was made on 24 separately engraved plates			0
' just a few hundred copies of the map were printed and only a handful are known to exist today			0
how things change : @entity138 , as it appears on the 18th century map			0
the market had existed at the site since 1654 sprawling : the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square , which was reopened as a shopping complex in 1980 after the market 's relocation in 1974 , is now a popular shopping and tourist site the map , titled ' a plan of the cities of @entity3 and @entity67 and borough of @entity154 ' is tipped to be sold for £ 40,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction house @entity93 after it was put up for sale by a private collector			1
mr @entity91 said : ' this is one of the original editions of the print which would have been limited to the low hundreds			0
the survival rates are very low and there are a handful in institutions			0
' when it was first printed it would have been in a gentleman 's library and at some point over the years it has found its way to a private collector			0
changes : newly built @entity175 is shown on the western edge of the city , before the open fields and market gardens of @entity23 , here called @entity181 ( left )			0
the fields around the square have long since been replaced with homes and businesses , and the square is now the centre of the exclusive @entity189 district infamous : the site of the gallows at @entity37 , where public executions were held for 600 years ( left ) , is now home to @entity38 ( right )			1
the structure was originally built to stand at the entrance to @entity20 , and was completed in 1833 , but it was moved to its current location in 1851 ' it has passed through the hands of many people but it is likely that it has always remained in @entity3			2
' the sheer size of this map combined with its incredible condition is what makes it so valuable			0
' this is one for someone who loves @entity3 and has a wall big enough to mount the map on			2
' anyone who sees this map is amazed by it			0
it is a beautiful work of art and a wonderful piece of history that tells the story of @entity3 almost 300 years ago			2
' dedication : a scroll on the map thanking the mayor and @entity224 of the city for their help with @entity31 's epic cartographic undertaking			0
