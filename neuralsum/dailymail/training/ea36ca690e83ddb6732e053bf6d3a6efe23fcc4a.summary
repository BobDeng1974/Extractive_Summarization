two - thirds of hospitals have sent teams of managers abroad to recruit foreign nurses , an investigation has found			1
and more than three - quarters are hiring nurses from abroad thanks to staff shortages across the @entity10			1
many recruit en masse in groups of 30 or 40 at a time from countries such as @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
but senior doctors are concerned that the nurses ’ poor command of @entity19 and potentially inadequate training puts patients at risk			1
dr @entity24 of the @entity25 said the @entity10 relies upon hardworking nurses from overseas the @entity27 , which regulates nurses , is forbidden from testing those arriving from @entity30 because @entity32 law states that this would inhibit ‘ freedom of movement ’			1
trusts are increasingly resorting to recruiting nurses from overseas because there are not enough @entity38 - trained applicants to fill places			1
the lack was highlighted last february by a report into the @entity43 hospital scandal , which warned wards across the @entity10 were desperately understaffed			1
an investigation by @entity46 using responses from 74 hospital trusts found 77 per cent had recruited nurses from abroad since 2010			2
two out of three hospitals had sent teams of managers to recruit groups of 30 or 40 at a time at recruitment fairs			1
the investigation estimated that 31 per cent of nurses working in hospitals in @entity19 had trained abroad			1
at the 64 trusts that were able to give a breakdown of staff members , 36,100 out of 114,669 nurses qualified overseas			2
the @entity25 warned recruiting from abroad was an expensive quick fix			0
chief executive dr @entity24 said : ‘ health care in the @entity38 relies on the hard work and dedication of many nurses who trained overseas , and we must not underestimate their contribution			0
‘ however it is important that overseas nurses are being employed for the right reasons and in a manageable way			0
recruiting from overseas is too often an expensive short - term fix when hospitals realise too late they do n’t have enough staff			0
in the long run , the @entity10 must ensure that it is training and recruiting enough nurses to meet the needs of patients , and planning for those times when demand is greatest			1
‘ without better forward planning , the @entity10 will spend its money on overseas recruitment at the expense of consistent staffing and high quality care			2
’ last month , figures from the @entity27 showed that the number of @entity32 nurses coming to work in @entity38 had doubled in four years			0
there are now 20,914 on the register who can work in hospitals and care homes , up from 10,244 in 2010			0
however , fertility expert @entity96 expressed concern over some nurses recruited from @entity30 @entity103 , of campaign group @entity104 , said : ‘ this sort of rise is really alarming			0
it seems we just are n’t training enough of our own nurses , we ought not to have this reliance on workers coming here from overseas			0
’ he added : ‘ again and again we have seen concerns about the communication skills of these workers , and communication is absolutely critical when it comes to healthcare			0
’ since the @entity27 is prevented from carrying out tests on nurses before they join the register , it urges hospitals and care homes to do their own checks while interviewing them			2
but a poll of 100 senior @entity10 managers in june found that 52 per cent did not normally use aptitude tests when recruiting nurses from the continent			1
one of @entity38 ’s top doctors , @entity96 , has expressed particular concern over nurses from @entity30			2
the peer , a world - renowned fertility expert , warned in 2011 that they had been trained in a ‘ completely different way ’ to @entity38 nurses and were not used to speaking to doctors or even patients			2
his concerns were echoed by @entity136 , a surgeon , who said : ‘ quite frankly this is an intolerable situation			0
’ a @entity139 spokesman said : ‘ nurses recruited from abroad make a valuable contribution to patient care but they should only work in the @entity10 if they have the right skills			1
‘ there are 6,300 more nurses on our wards than in 2010			0
trusts are responsible for planning and recruiting their workforce and ensuring they have the appropriate levels of staff			0

many are bringing in groups of 30 or 40 nurses at a time to fill major gaps
