as the story goes , the mythical @entity0 was an ancient tentacled sea monster that ate whales and devoured entire ships			1
in 2011 researchers found the remains of a marine lizard that had been arranged in a strange pattern by what they claimed was a giant @entity0 - style octopus playing with its food			1
these claims were widely criticised , but now new fossils discovered by the same researchers add further weight to the theory that the @entity0 not only existed , but that he used his prey 's bones as art. this fossil , found in @entity23 in @entity24 by professor @entity25 is believed to be part of the beak of a giant ancient octopus - or squid - type creature			1
this has revived claims made by @entity25 that a mythical tentacled sea monster called the @entity0 may have actually existed both claims have been made by professor @entity25 , a paleontologist at @entity34 in @entity35			1
professor @entity25 initially found the strange arrangement of vertebrae of the ichthyosaur @entity38 in @entity23 in @entity24			2
the shonisaurus was a sea reptile that lived around 200 million to 250 million years ago			0
his latest discoveries include the beak of what is believed to be an ancient cephalopod , as well as more bones arranged in unusual patterns and shapes			1
discovery : researcher @entity49 says this arrangement of lizard bones , which were brought to this area in a pattern of a tentacle , could prove the existence of the @entity0 the new discovery of fossils , including this shell - like fossil believed to belong to an ancient octopus - type creature , made @entity33 's @entity25 's ' eyes pop out of his head ' because they supported his 2011 theory about the existence of the @entity0 this new arrangement of ichthyosaur fossils , which professor @entity25 saw from a photo taken at the @entity67 's @entity66 , show the bones laid out in the museum exactly how they had been found in the park			1
next to the remains of the ichthyosaur was a ' debris pile ' of scattered bones that were no longer in their correct order within the skeleton			0
@entity25 told @entity78 : ' when i saw that photograph , basically my eyeballs popped out			0
' ' we think one plausible explanation of this is an attack on the icthyosaur by a much larger predator			0
' professor @entity25 argues that the way the bones were arranged could not have occurred naturally			2
he reiterated his point at a meeting of geoscientists recently by saying there was ' virtually zero ' chance the sea 's currents could have moved them into such an arrangement			0
as the story goes , the mythical @entity0 , illustrated here , was an ancient tentacled sea monster , which ate whales and devoured entire ships			1
stories about this monster seem to date back to 12th century @entity105			0
these tales often refer to a creature so big it was mistaken for an island professor @entity25 said that evidence of the @entity0 , which would have been up to 30 metres long , comes from the vicious injures it inflicted on the giant marine reptile ichthyosaur , either by drowning the creature or snapping its neck			1
the researcher claims he can tell this by examining the placement and sucker markings on bones , which seems to prove the creatures were drowned or had their necks snapped by a @entity0 - like creature			1
but professor professor @entity25 said : ' i was aware that anytime there is controversy about depth , there is probably something interesting going on			0
' a @entity0 destroys the @entity130 in the 2006 @entity133 film @entity131 : @entity131 , still from the film is pictured ' it became very clear that something very odd was going on there , " he said			2
' it was a very odd configuration of bones			0
professor @entity25 also noticed , because of the arrangement , that they had been carried away from where they were killed , leading him to think they had been carried to the @entity0 's lair and dumped in the pattern of the mysterious creature 's tentacles in a ' midden ' - a pile of remains accumulated by the beast			1
' modern octopus will do this , ' professor @entity25 said			0
' what if there was an ancient , very large sort of octopus , like the @entity0 of mythology ? ' ' i think that these things were captured by the @entity0 and taken to the midden and the cephalopod would take them apart			2
' professor @entity25 explained the absence of any @entity0 fossils with the fact that octopuses are soft - bodied creatures , but sceptics say his explanation is simply circumstantial evidence			2
today 's cephalopods - even the largest - are rarely much bigger than a human being			0
the largest existing specimens of this @entity176 giant octopus species tend to weigh around 150lb			0

@entity0 is a *legendary* tentacled monster that ate whales and even ships
markings found in 2011 gave rise to claims the @entity0 may have existed
researchers have now found a fossil said to belong to an ancient squid
they also found bones from the animal 's prey arranged in strange patterns
discoveries have revived claims about the mythical creature 's existence
