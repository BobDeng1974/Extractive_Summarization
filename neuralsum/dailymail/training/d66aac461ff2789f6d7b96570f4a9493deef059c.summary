a mysterious discovery has been made inside the wall of a seaside house - the lid of an @entity5 coffin thought to date back 3,000 years			1
@entity7 @entity6 was assessing the contents of a property after the death of its owner when he found the cobweb - covered relic			1
it was standing upright in the cavity of an outside wall , complete with painted face and faded hieroglyphics			1
who are you ? the lid ( pictured ) was discovered standing upright inside the cavity of an outside wall , complete with painted face and faded hieroglyphics			1
how it came to be inside the house remains a mystery mr @entity6 consulted historians at @entity27 who said the six - foot - long sarcophagus cover appeared to date from @entity29			1
but how it came to reside inside the modest address which was being renovated in @entity32 , @entity30 remains a mystery			0
mr @entity6 , 55 , said : ' it really was quite bizarre			1
i 'd been asked to look at the house by relatives of the previous owner , who 'd died			2
out of place : there is no sign of the mummy or the rest of the coffin and no information about how it came to reside in @entity32 ( mapped ) mr @entity6 ( pictured ) said : ' when i stuck my head through i was surprised to see the coffin lid leaning up against a wall in the corner , covered in dust and cobwebs ... it was just like a scene from an @entity55 movie ' ' when i got there the renovation work was fully under way , and a large hole had been smashed in one of the outside walls			1
the lid is due to go to auction on september 13 with a current estimate of £ 1,000 to £ 2,000 ' when i stuck my head through and looked inside , i was surprised to see the coffin lid leaning up against a wall in the corner , covered in dust and cobwebs			1
' there was a painted face on it and some hieroglyphics			1
' it was just like a scene from an @entity55 movie			0
' mr @entity6 said the new owners of the house had no idea what the coffin lid was , but imagined it had been part of a collection of ancient items			1
he added : ' i believe the previous owner may have collected old artefacts			0
there were other very old items in the house			0
' if the coffin lid is indeed from 700 @entity29 , that places it within the 25th dynasty in @entity94 , when @entity95 was on the throne			1
@entity95 , also known as @entity97 , was the third king of the 25th dynasty and ruled from 707 bc to 690 bc. he was the nephew and successor of @entity99			1
and a son of @entity101 , the founder of this dynasty			0
@entity95 's throne name was @entity104 , meaning ' enduring is the soul '			2
there is no sign of the mummy or the rest of the coffin and no information about how it came to reside in @entity113			0
the lid is due to go under the hammer on september 13 with a current estimate of £ 1,000 to £ 2,000			0
the history of mummification has recently been called into question after a study revealed that @entity5 were mummifying their dead 1,500 years earlier than previously thought			2
traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient @entity5 cemeteries			2
the formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area of northern @entity94 by more than a millennium			0
experts identified a pine resin , an aromatic plant extract , a plant gum , a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at @entity143 , in the region of @entity94			0
the embalming agents that were found make up a similar recipe to those used at the zenith of @entity150 mummification around 3,000 years later			0
the textile sample is held in the @entity153 museum and was collected in the 1930s , according to the study published in @entity156			0
academics say that the 11 - year study , which also involved @entity159 in @entity160 , rewrites our understanding of the ancient civilisation			0
traditional theories on ancient @entity5 mummification suggest that in prehistory - the @entity167 and @entity168 periods between around 4,500 and 3,100 bc - bodies dried naturally through the action of the hot , dry desert sand			2
if the coffin lid is indeed from 700 @entity29 , that places it within the @entity5 25th dynasty , when @entity95 ( sculpture pictured ) was on the throne			1
@entity95 , also known as @entity97 , was the third king of the 25th dynasty and ruled from 707 bc to 690 bc. modern lifestyles are often blamed for causing blocked arteries but our long - dead ancestors suffered from the same unhealthy symptoms , claim scientists			1
the remarkably preserved mummies from five ancient cultures – including @entity5 living 3,000 years ago – bear the unmistakeable hallmarks of heart disease			2
ct scans of hundreds of bodies found atherosclerosis , the narrowing of the arteries due to build - up of fatty deposits , which is the underlying disease process that causes heart attack and strokes			2
forebears suffered repeated infections , parasites and the ill - effects of breathing in smoke from cooking fires			0
but the triggers must have been very different from those afflicting us in modern times , it is claimed			0
instead of a high fat diet , cigarette smoking and obesity being to blame , it is more likely our forebears suffered repeated infections , parasites and the ill - effects of breathing in smoke from cooking fires .			0
