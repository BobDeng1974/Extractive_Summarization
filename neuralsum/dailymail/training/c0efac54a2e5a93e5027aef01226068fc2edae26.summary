a major water company has to spend £ 7 million every year clearing sewers which have been blocked by foreign objects accidentally flushed down the toilet			1
among the detritus recovered from @entity6 's sewers are toys , mobile phones and even some false teeth			1
such is the extent of the problem , that workers are removing on average one tonne of waste a day			0
much of the rubbish , such as disposable wipes , needs to be removed by hand and then compacted			0
@entity17 , spokeswoman for @entity18 , said : “ all that should go down is poo , pee and paper			2
' the main problem by a long stretch is disposable wipes which people put down the toilet instead of in the bin			0
