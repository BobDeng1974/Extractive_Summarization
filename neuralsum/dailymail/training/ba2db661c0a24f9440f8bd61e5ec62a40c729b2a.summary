by @entity0 it 's happened again			2
back in 1992 @entity3 's then prime minister @entity2 infamously put his left arm around @entity6 's back			1
the unashamed republican was quickly called ' @entity8 ' as a result and found himself at the centre of a diplomatic storm			2
well now it seems both sides of @entity3 politics are guilty of prohibited pats on the back			1
the photo was uploaded to the @entity3 @entity32 feed and immediately drew ire from the the online community			0
described as ' a hug ' by the magazine , the stray arm was dubbed ' awkward ' by one user and ' not appropriate ' by another			0
others said : ' what is it with our pms touching up royalty ! ' and ' what a creep '			0
the photo had been liked more than 400 times by the time it was republished by the @entity50			0
' @entity8 ' : then prime minister @entity2 copped plenty for this embrace of @entity6 in 1992 in arm 's way : fish shop owner @entity55 was guilty of similar gaffe in october the pm was earlier derided by some when he said the @entity27 and @entity59 were ' bigger than ( surfing champion ) @entity60 ' after their visit to @entity62 last week			1
protocol dictates that no commoner should touch a royal , except for a handshake if an arm is first extended to them			2
@entity69 caused a right royal racket in 2009 when she warmly put her arm around @entity6			1
in a massive shock , her majesty followed suit and hugged the first lady back			1
@entity3 's second longest - serving prime minister @entity76 denies to this day that he placed a hand around @entity6 at a reception in 2000 , with photos suggesting he came - at least - mightily close			1
in october , @entity80 fish shop manager @entity55 seemingly guided the sovereign into her @entity83 store with a friendly arm around the waist			0
