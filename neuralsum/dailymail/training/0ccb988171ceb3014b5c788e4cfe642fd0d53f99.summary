and we think about you when you go to bed at night and you 're all alone , " ' @entity13 told the @entity118			1

' my son was five and he was outside playing in the backyard , ' @entity13 says in the film			1
' the windows were open and the breeze was blowing in with the sounds of their laughter and playfulness			0
' i just soaked in that moment thinking , ' is this going to be the last time i ever hear this ? in a matter of minutes i 'm going to have to shatter their world and tell them something no parent would ever want to say			0
am i ever going to hear them laugh again ?
