they 're the bane of a-listers everywhere thanks to their long lenses and gift for catching a celebrity during moments they would rather the public did n't see but the origin of the paparazzi are more glamorous than the modern incarnation would suggest			0
now a new exhibition is to turn the lens on some of the first paparazzo , who documented the golden age of @entity16 cinema , provoking outrage from their a-list subjects and adoration from the public who devoured their work			1
but it 's not all @entity25 - style paparazzi dust - ups : the 80 photos set to go on display at the @entity28 from 30th april also offer a glimpse of the dolce vita or ' sweet life ' enjoyed by @entity16 movie stars and @entity34 royalty working in @entity35 during the 1950s and ' 60s			1
public holiday : @entity37 surrounded by paparazzi during a holiday in @entity40 , june 1961 the two decades were a golden era in @entity16 film when directors such as @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 produced some of their most famous films , including the latter ’s iconic @entity50 ( 1960 )			1
so successful was the @entity16 film making industry , @entity34 stars such as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 flocked to @entity35 , along with directors lured by the comparatively inexpensive @entity60 studios			1
in the @entity68 studios , some of the biggest films of the age , among them @entity61 ( 1959 ) and @entity62 ( 1963 ) were shot			0
in the evenings , however , a different type of camera lens took over , with photojournalists with an eye on the bottom line unable to resist the lure of the a-lister packed bars and restaurants that lined the city ’s exclusive @entity79			0
private moment : @entity82 and @entity56 kissing in @entity83 , june 1962 and photographed by @entity84 arrival : a @entity84 shot of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , arriving at a @entity35 restaurant in 1961 one of the most skillful was @entity84 , whose photos vividly evoke an era of extraordinary glamour , creativity and decadence			1
@entity84 , who died in 1998 , eventually amassed an archive of more than a million images , many featuring period heavyweights such as @entity37 , @entity56 and @entity99			2
and @entity84 was unique in another way too , making the decision early in his career to sell his work to press agencies rather than direct to papers in much the same way that paparazzi do today			2
initially , he was employed by the @entity110 - @entity109 agency , then one of the most high - profile of its kind , where he earned a a reputation both for the technical quality of his images and his talent for capturing dramatic , eye - catching moments , before going freelance			0
ironically , @entity84 made his name with harrowing images of a fire at the @entity124 on @entity79 : the very street that would later provide him with arresting imagery of a quite different nature , as he travelled along it on his scooter on the lookout for celebrities			0
portrait of a film star : @entity99 ( left ) and @entity134 and @entity135 on set ( right ) intimate : @entity137 and @entity138 papped enjoying their supper in @entity35 , september 1960 ready to work : @entity141 and @entity142 at photographed outside the @entity60 , june 1961 @entity143 : @entity82 dining with friends at a restaurant in @entity146 , @entity35 , june 1963 many capture moments when , as he put it , ' the ordinary coexisted with the extraordinary ’ , as in his image of @entity56 wandering with a friend through the streets of @entity60 dressed as @entity62 , or the actor @entity153 riding down the @entity79 on horseback			1
one of his most famous shots is that of @entity82 kissing @entity56 while holidaying in @entity83 , a photograph recently listed among the 30 most famous images in history , alongside works by @entity160 and @entity161			0
yet despite the loveliness of his work , the celebrities he photographed considered the behaviour of the paparazzi as intrusive then as they do today			0
glamorous : @entity170 actress @entity169 driving a @entity171 through the streets of @entity35 in may 1962 romance : @entity137 and @entity138 leaving @entity174 , @entity35 , october 1962 attack : like @entity25 , @entity176 , seen here hitting @entity177 at the @entity178 , was no fan of the paps one photograph captures the actor @entity176 in the act of assaulting @entity84 ’s fellow paparazzo , @entity177 , at the @entity178 , while another series of images show @entity169 in her stockinged feet confronting another paparazzo with a bow and arrow before attacking him with her fists			2
while the a-listers they followed loathed them , @entity84 and his ilk produced some of the most iconic images of the 1950s ; cementing @entity34 's place in popular culture in the process			2
love them or loathe them , there 's no denying that the paparazzo - and the public who adored them - changed the face of photojournalism forever			0
