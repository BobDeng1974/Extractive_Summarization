the company recruited seven women of different ages and backgrounds and asked them to describe their facial features , then enlisted @entity13 - trained sketch artist @entity12 to draw them based on their input			1
the poignant video has been viewed a staggering 6.5 million times on the brands @entity18 channel , making it the second most viewed @entity18 video after @entity22 â€™s @entity21			1
when asked to describe themselves to @entity12 , viewers can hear the women saying things like ' i kind of have a fat , rounder face ' and ' i would say i have a pretty big forehead			2
' the two portraits , drawn from descriptions by the woman herself and a stranger , were often dramatically different and reveal women tend to underestimate their looks a survey that showed only two percent of women worldwide would describe themselves as beautiful , prompting @entity2 to launch the campaign many of the women seem stunned when they see the stark contrast between the two drawings side - by - side opposing views : @entity2 recruited an @entity13 artist to sketch women based on a description of themselves , and then a stranger 's description			1
the results were radically different the women were also asked to spend time with strangers , but neither party was told why			2
when asked general questions about the women , the strangers were much kinder			2
' she was so thin you could see her cheekbones , ' said one , while another man remarked ' she had nice eyes ; they lit up when she spoke			0
' @entity13 - trained sketch artist @entity12 did n't see any of the women he was drawing , working solely on information he was given verbally different drawings : one subject was stunned to see the difference between the sketch based on her own self - description ( center ) , and the sketch based on the description by strangers ( right ) transforming self - perception : another subject only told the artist about her flaws ( center ) while strangers were able to see the positives in her appearance ( right ) @entity2 began the first @entity87 in 2004 , after conducting a survey that showed only two percent of women worldwide would describe themselves as beautiful			1
in the two drawings are shown side - by - side , the contrast is stark - and the women seem stunned			0
' she looks closed off and fatter			0
sadder too , ' said one woman when asked to describe the two sketches			0
' the other one looks more open , friendly and happy			0
' model subjects : @entity13 - trained forensic artist @entity12 sketched two composites of each woman , and the results were startling the women seem reflective after the experience and seemed to have a new appreciation for their looks sadly women the women can be heard saying negative things about themselves like ' i kind of have a fat , rounder face ' after the experience , many of the women seemed to have a new appreciation for their looks - flaws and all			1
' we spend a lot of time as women analyzing and trying to fix the things that are n't quite right , ' says @entity123 , one of the participants			0
' we should spend more time appreciating the things that we do like			0

artist could not see the women , so he sketched pictures based on their descriptions of themselves
he then **created** a second drawing based on a stranger 's description of the women . in all cases , the pictures **created** with stranger 's input were much more *attractive*
