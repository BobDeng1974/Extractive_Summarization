@entity0 are far too good to go down			1
right ? of course they are			0
while this @entity0 squad is n't equipped to challenge for a top - four place , there 's no way in hell they 'll be involved in a relegation battle at the end of the season			1
but that 's what we said about @entity14 's @entity13 in 1993 , @entity15 in 2003 , @entity16 12 months later			0
they were all too good to go down			0
@entity0 have lost five of their opening 11 @entity20 games under @entity21 this season @entity23 striker @entity22 has struggled for form at @entity25 @entity27 @entity26 arrived as a high - rated midfielder but has not started for @entity21 's side this season @entity30 ( left ) has had some spectacular moments for @entity0 this term but his form is still inconsistent @entity34 has shown some value for money for @entity0 but only in patches @entity21 's start at @entity25 has been chequered to say the least			1
his side 's form in the @entity41 and @entity42 has been good			2
but it 's their @entity20 form that 'll be concerning the @entity44			1
five defeats from their opening 11 games has left them with an uphill struggle to even be in contention for a @entity52 position			1
on 14 points , they are closer to rock - bottom @entity55 than league leaders @entity56			0
losing @entity58 at the start of last season was always going to be a huge blow for @entity21 with some of the talent at @entity21 's disposal , that statistic is unforgivable			1
losing @entity58 at the start of last season was always going to be a huge loss			0
take a player of @entity58 's quality out of any side , you 'll notice the difference			2
just ask @entity71 about what impact @entity73 's departure at @entity74 has had on his side this season			2
@entity58 was replaced by a raft of new signings in 2013 ; players which we were led to believe would make @entity0 a better all - round outfit - even without their superstar @entity83			1
@entity84 guided @entity0 to fourth place in the final @entity20 standings back in 2012 it turns out that @entity0 signed a raft of duds			1
@entity89 that found out to his detriment last season , @entity21 is finding out now			2
@entity92 arrived from @entity93 with a hugely impressive goal record			2
the less said about him said the better			0
@entity26 came with the reputation of being one of the best central midfielders in @entity98 when he arrived from @entity99			2
he has n't started a single league game this season			0
@entity30 did , of course , score that sublime @entity104 goal against @entity105 earlier this season , but he 's hardly proved a worthwhile Â£ 30million deal			1
@entity34 has shown some value for money , but only in patches			1
what has happened to all these players ? has all that talent just vanished into the north @entity114 atmosphere ? spurs are in the midst of an alarming slide down to mid-table obscurity			2
if things continue , that scenario could get even worse			0
@entity0 chairman @entity121 will be expecting @entity21 to turn @entity0 's fortunes around quickly will they get relegated ? no chance			1
but the fact we are even discussing the prospect is a sad indictment of how far their fortunes have fallen in the past two - and - a - half years			0
a team that finished fourth under @entity84 in 2012 has gone backwards			1
it begs the question of why @entity84 was ever relieved of his duties later that summer			0
that 's an altogether different topic , though			0
the only topic that concerns @entity0 fans at the moment is how they can wrestle themselves out of their current malaise			0
giving @entity21 funds to sign the two strikers he wants in january will be a start			1
to judge @entity21 at this early stage of his tenure would be unfair			0
this is not his @entity0 team			1
but as history tells , @entity0 chairman @entity121 is n't one for excuses .			0

@entity21 's @entity0 side have lost five of their opening 11 @entity20 matches
big money signings such as @entity92 , @entity26 , @entity30 and @entity34 have struggled to impress at @entity25
spurs , who are currently 12th in the @entity20 table , finished fourth under @entity84 in 2012
@entity21 needs funds to sign the two strikers he wants in january
@entity163 has *blasted* @entity0 ' home *crowd* for *booing* the team and claimed the players feel more at ease playing away
