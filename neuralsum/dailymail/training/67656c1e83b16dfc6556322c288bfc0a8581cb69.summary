by @entity0 same - sex couples can now create their own coat of arms			1
for centuries , married couples have been designing shared shields that combine their family histories in one heraldic symbol			1
but the strict rules of the ancient body meant civil partners could not qualify			1
@entity11 : sir @entity12 , believed to be marrying his civil partner @entity13 this month , currently holds an ' escutcheon ' , or shield , featuring a keyboard , records and a satyr playing pan pipes			1
once married , the couple could apply to ' impale ' his with a design created for mr @entity13 , according to the newly - revealed @entity23 rules now , a month on from the first ever same - sex marriage , the @entity23 has revealed gay and lesbian married couples can be welcomed into the tradition			1
sir @entity12 , who is believed to be marrying his civil partner @entity13 in a private ceremony this month , currently holds an ' escutcheon ' , or shield , featuring a keyboard , records and a satyr playing pan pipes			2
if mr @entity13 applies to join the college , the couple will be able to have a shared design fashioned once they are married			2
a shared shield is traditionally split vertically , with the husband 's design on one side and the wife 's on the other			2
@entity46 , @entity47 , ' impaled ' her shield ( left ) with that of her husband , prince @entity50			2
it features her family 's symbol of a boar 's head , as well as her husband 's motto ' @entity58 ' , which means ' i serve ' , and a royal crown			1
@entity50 's ( right ) holds a number of features of the royal coat of arms , including the @entity65 motto the royal coat of arms represents all parts of the @entity68 , and it is surrounded by a garter bearing the motto @entity70 ( ' evil to him who evil thinks ' ) men have always been able to maintain their own without changing it , but brides have been obliged to commission a redesign that gives a nod to their husband 's stature			1
today , the @entity23 ruled men and women who contract a same - sex marriage can ' impale ' the arms of their husband or wife with their own on a shield or banner			1
@entity91 came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use , taking up responsibility for the control of their use			1
over time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in society			2
the @entity23 , a branch of the royal household , is the official body in the @entity68 that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical issues			1
the arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of arms			2
however , that does n't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms			2
the cumulative knowledge of the @entity126 gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people do n't proceed with their application			2
the late @entity131 , a former @entity132 , once said : ' in practice , eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission , a sound university degree or professional qualification , or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole			1
' if their spouse dies , the bearer can continue to wear the joint emblem , the ruling added			2
and in a landmark amendment , women are now free to choose whether or not their coat of arms features their spouse at all			1
with a strict set of criteria , initially drawn up by @entity154 in 1434 , applicants must be of ' eminence or good standing in national or local life ' to get one			1
honours from the crown , military commissions , university degrees and professional qualifications are taken into account			1
those who are descended from awardees automatically qualify			2
@entity166 , who went to @entity167 , is eligible for an escutcheon - and could apply for a shared emblem if she were to marry civil partner @entity170			1
each design must be unique and have at least two ' linear differences ' so that it can be distinct if shown in black and white			2
it costs £ 5,250 to design a coat of arms for a man ; £ 3,750 for a woman			2
as a family has legal ownership of its coat of arms , a case could technically be brought in the @entity182 if designs were too similar or if someone used another person 's heraldry			0
no such action has been taken since 1954 when @entity188 successfully sued the @entity189 for using its coat of arms			0
ahead of her marriage to @entity192 , @entity193 designed her own family coat of arms , to be impaled with his			0
although @entity193 's ancestors include coal miners and carpenters , she was welcomed by the college			0
the grant was made to @entity193 's father @entity201 because the coat of arms is passed down the male line			0
this allows @entity193 's siblings to use the design			0
seeking advice from @entity210 's etiquette coach @entity209 , her mother @entity207 settled on a design that reflected their @entity212 , as well as their love of skiing			0
the design features three acorns to reflect oak trees in their family village of @entity221 , as well as strength and @entity212			0
the chevrons are symbols of mountains , as the family are all keen skiiers			0
@entity192 ’s design is a version of the @entity230 which was granted to him by the @entity231 on his 18th birthday			0
it shows the various royal emblems of the @entity68 : the three lions of @entity236 , the lion of @entity238 and the harp of @entity240			0
it is surrounded by a blue garter bearing the motto @entity70 – shame to those who think evil of it – which symbolises the @entity247 of which he is a @entity250			0
both shields are supported by the @entity253 ’s ‘ supporters ’ – a royal lion and unicorn , each wearing a three pointed collar , known as a label			1
following their 2011 wedding , the @entity253 and @entity47 had a shared escutcheon fashioned			0
the label has a red scallop shell derived from the @entity263 coat of arms , which has been used by the ancestors of princess @entity265 for centuries			1
flowing out from the top of the @entity268 is ‘ mantling ’ , which represents the slashed cloth hung around the necks of knights fighting in the heat of the @entity274 during the @entity275			0
@entity276 , of the @entity23 , said : ‘ any married couple who are both entitled to arms are entitled to combine them in a @entity268			1
@entity253 and @entity47 : prince @entity192 and @entity193 had their shields impaled following their 2011 wedding to reflect their families ' histories @entity193 's family had to have a coat of arms designed especially for the union , which was then featured on the programme for the royal wedding the @entity193 's design , unveiled ( left ) by senior herald @entity290 , features acorns representing @entity212 and the oak trees in their village of @entity221			1
the chevrons that reflect mountains in a nod to the family 's love of skiing			0
bestowed to her father , it means the coat of arms can be passed down for the whole family to use @entity307 painter @entity306 sketches a coat of arms for the @entity193			0
each design must have two linear differences so it scan be distinct in black and white ‘ there are different rules and conventions as to how this works , depending on who the individual is , but as the @entity253 is a @entity247 his is encircled by the blue garter bearing its motto			0
‘ as his wife is not , a wreath was made to balance hers out decoratively			0
obviously that will change if she , in the future , is made a member herself			0
’ the royal coat of arms has evolved over many years and reflects the history of the @entity327 and of the country			0
in the design the shield shows the various @entity65 emblems of different parts of the @entity68 : the three lions of @entity236 in the first and fourth quarters , the lion of @entity238 in the second and the harp of @entity240 in the third			0
@entity338 speaker @entity337 had a coat of arms designed to reflect his work to champion gay rights , including a rainbow - edged scroll and pink triangles it is surrounded by a garter bearing the motto @entity70 ( ' evil to him who evil thinks ' ) , which symbolises the @entity247 , an ancient order of knighthood of which the @entity231 is @entity354			1
the shield is supported by the @entity236 lion and @entity238 unicorn and is surmounted by the royal crown			0
below it appears the motto of the @entity354 , @entity360 ( ' @entity361 and my right ' )			0
the plant badges of the @entity68 - rose , thistle and shamrock - are often displayed beneath the shield			1
it is customary for individuals to develop their coat of arms to reflect their life and work over time			1
@entity337 , speaker of the house of commons , unveiled his in 2011 , which reflects the work he has done to champion gay rights			0
bearing the motto ' @entity377 ' , it is embellished with pink triangles and a rainbow - coloured scroll .			1
