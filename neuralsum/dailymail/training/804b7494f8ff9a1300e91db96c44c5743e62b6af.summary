by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent criticised : leading doctors say shadow health secretary @entity3 was ' misguided ' when he demanded a moratorium on new @entity6 contracts being signed with private companies leading doctors say @entity8 would put patients ‘ at great risk ’ through its plans to restrict the number of private firms running @entity6 services			1
in a letter to the @entity17 , the senior medics say services could worsen if the @entity18 is not able to make use of the best providers			0
they say shadow health secretary @entity3 was ‘ misguided ’ this week when he demanded a moratorium on new contracts being signed with charities and private companies			1
mr @entity3 said the government ’s ‘ privatisation ’ agenda was ‘ indefensible ’			1
he called for all pending @entity6 contracts with the private sector to be put on hold until the next election – except where there would otherwise be a threat to the provision of services			1
but critics accused him of hypocrisy , pointing out that mr @entity3 ’s term as health secretary saw a big increase in the use of private firms to provide services , run treatment centres and build hospitals			1
now he has come under attack from senior doctors , including dr @entity48 , president of @entity49 , the body which represents gps in charge of @entity6 budgets			1
several gps who chair local clinical commissioning groups ( @entity55 ) have added their names to the letter , which is published on @entity58			2
they wrote : ‘ as doctors seeking to ensure the best possible health services for our patients , we are extremely concerned about the proposals announced this week by @entity3			1
they would put patients and services at great risk			0
’ the doctors said it was ‘ absolutely untrue ’ to suggest there was any kind of privatisation agenda within @entity70 – or that they are forced to contract out for every service			0
they say the amount of @entity6 care commissioned from the private sector is in fact less than 6 per cent			0
risk : in a letter to the @entity17 , the senior medics said services could worsen if the @entity18 is not able to make use of the best providers			2
they claimed @entity8 's plans would put patients ' at great risk ' ( file picture ) ‘ local @entity51 groups must retain the freedom to make use of innovation , experience and investment from all sectors to improve patient care , ’ they said			1
last night a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 spending on private firms broke the £ 10billion barrier last year – much higher than 6 per cent			1
’ ' as doctors seeking to ensure the best possible health services for our patients , we are extremely concerned about the proposals announced this week by the @entity104 , @entity3			2
they would put patients and services at great risk			0
' @entity106 ( @entity55 ) , now responsible for commissioning local health services , are improving population health and also living within their budgets by embracing localism and partnership working			0
' it is absolutely untrue to suggest there is any kind of ‘ privatisation ’ agenda within @entity55 or that we are forced to contract out for every service			0
the amount of @entity6 care commissioned from the private sector is today less than 6 % , having grown slowly but steadily for ten years			0
' local gps groups must retain the freedom to make use of innovation , experience and investment from all sectors to improve patient care			0
as both the previous @entity8 government and the current coalition have made clear , we must move on from the old debates about ' public versus private ' and provider whatever is best for patients			2
' to argue that charities or private companies should be allowed a role in bringing down waiting lists but not in supporting improved patient care is misguided			0
' it should also be noted that guidance issued in march 2010 by @entity3 when he was health secretary also makes clear that a ' preferred provider ' policy which favours state - owned organisations is illegal under @entity147 law			1
' this week ’s announcement will cause confusion for @entity55 at a time when politicians should be supporting and trusting the hard work of local gp - led commissioning groups			0
' yours dr @entity48 , president @entity154 , chair @entity156 , chair @entity160 dr @entity159 , clinical chair , @entity162 dr @entity161 dr @entity163 , chair , @entity165 dr @entity164 , clinical chief officer , @entity170 dr @entity169 dr @entity169 dr @entity168 dr @entity166 dr @entity167 dr @entity166 '			2
