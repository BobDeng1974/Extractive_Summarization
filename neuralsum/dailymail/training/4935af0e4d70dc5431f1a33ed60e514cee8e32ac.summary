three thousand years ago @entity0 in @entity1 were skilled boat builders and sailors , enjoyed fishing , and the occasional bowl of nettle stew - and used a method of eel trapping still used today			1
they even used wooden cutlery			0
this incredible , detailed picture of life three millennia ago is thanks to a haul of @entity16 boats , spears , swords and clothing have been unearthed at one of the most significant @entity16 sites ever found in @entity0 , on the @entity22 , at @entity24 quarry , @entity25			1
site assistants @entity27 ( right ) and @entity29 work on a @entity16 long boat unearthed along the old course of the @entity22 at @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity32 @entity16 long boat : researchers say the rare find in the @entity1 fens provides possibly the most detailed view yet of what life was like 3,000 years ago researchers say the rare find in the @entity1 fens provides possibly the most detailed view yet of what life was like 3,000 years ago			1
preserved in silt and peat along the old course of the @entity22 , at @entity24 quarry , @entity25 , items which would normally have long since decomposed have been pulled out of the earth by archaeologists in pristine condition			1
the archaeologists have been able to dig to a much deeper level than normal by working with a local clay company @entity51 , from @entity53 ’s archaeological unit , which is carrying out the dig , said : ‘ it is giving us a @entity58 vision of this community that we only see very rarely anywhere in the world , let alone in this country			0
‘ usually at a later @entity16 period site you get pits , post-holes and maybe one or two really exciting metal finds			1
‘ convincing people that such places were once thriving settlements takes some imagination			0
‘ but this time so much more has been preserved - we can actually see everyday life during the @entity16 in the round			1
’ the site is being excavated ahead of the extension of a local brick quarry and its importance means that it is now likely to be further investigated for some years			2
site assistant @entity27 works on a @entity16 long boat unearthed along the old course of the @entity22 at @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity32 hundreds of objects have been found			1
the most spectacular find is that of six boats , all from the @entity16 but appearing at different levels in the silted up river			1
these range from just over two metres to a little more than eight metres in length			0
each was hollowed out of the trunk of an oak tree and in some cases decorated with extensive carvings			0
elsewhere , the site has revealed weaponry such as swords and spears still with their handles intact , and everyday items such as wooden spoons , part of a cape , green and blue beads , ropes , buckets and wicker baskets			1
some of the weapons bear similarities to those found in northern @entity108			0
there were no significant coastal ports during the @entity16 but the finds suggest @entity1 waterways may have been an important channel of communication with the frontiers of @entity0 and the continent			1
it also indicates people were more mobile than previously thought			2
our ancestors were much more mobile than previously thought - the research hints that the community sailed around the waterways of @entity1 , rather than remaining in one place researchers have identified the site of the settlement itself to the east of the current excavations			1
it is believed to have burned down at some point around @entity132			0
all that is missing from the picture of the society are the bodies of the people who lived there			0
human remains may be lying in an as yet unexcavated area of land nearby , or they may have been buried in the river making them harder to find			2
the community would have lived on the river , fishing for perch , pike and eels			2
according to the remains of a meal found in one wooden bowl on the site , they also enjoyed the occasional nettle stew			2
one locally significant discovery is that of eel traps			2
remarkably , the 3,000 - year - old versions are very similar to those still used in @entity1 today			1
‘ a modern - day trapper was able to come in and tell us exactly how these traps were used and why , ’ mr @entity51 said			0
‘ it ’s amazing that such an ancient technology has continued right up to the present virtually unchanged			0
’ archaeologists have been working closely with @entity164 , the brick and cement supplier which owns the quarry			0
the company ’s need for clay which lies at @entity172 age levels in the earth means that the dig team have been able to excavate far deeper than on normal archaeological sites .			0

early @entity0 were very mobile - and ' commuted ' via river
@entity16 *fishermen* used a method of eel trapping still used today
site contains long boats , spears , swords , clothing - and even *jewellery*
