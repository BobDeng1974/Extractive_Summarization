anyone who was anyone in @entity2 society in the 1830s was expected to attend the @entity5 exhibition			1
the playwrights and actors of the @entity10 theatres , the @entity12 art critics , the moneyed nabobs returned from @entity13 with grand town houses to fill with art from the masters of the day			0
for the artists who exhibited in the @entity5 ’s high - ceilinged rooms , the exhibition was the culmination of a year ’s work			1
it had the power to make an artist ’s name — or ruin him			0
each year , more than 1,000 pictures were exhibited in the crowded galleries , hung frame - to - frame from skirting board to ceiling			0
the power of the @entity5 ’s @entity32 was immense			2
@entity34 's @entity33 of @entity35 ( ' @entity36 , june 18th , 1817 ' ) and exhibited in 1833 a spot opposite the doors could mean an artist spent the next year being courted by aristocratic clients with commissions to paint their country estate , their beautiful wife or their adored @entity44			1
a painting unfavourably hung up by the cornice meant another year starving in a garret			0
in this competitive field , painters resorted to all manner of dirty tricks to gain advantage			0
the days before the opening of the exhibition , when artists were allowed to apply a final coat to their paintings in situ , were particularly fraught			0
painters at war : @entity34 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) in 1833 , two of the giants of @entity65 painting @entity61 and @entity34 found that their paintings had been hung side - by - side in one of the main galleries			1
@entity61 , who was touching up another picture in the next room , came several times to cast an eye between his ‘ @entity73 ’ — a @entity75 seascape — and @entity34 ’s ‘ @entity33 of @entity35 ’			1
this must have infuriated constable , who was carefully applying flecks of vermilion paint to the flags decorating the barges of his own painting			0
the grove : the @entity86 two - bedroom cottage that artist @entity34 lived in during the 1820s after several trips back and forth , @entity61 finally returned with his palette and , leaning close to the canvas , applied a daub of red , no bigger than a shilling , over his grey sea			1
he left without saying a word , the paint still wet and glistening			0
it was another day - and - a - half before @entity61 returned , and then , in the last moments allowed for alterations , he glazed the scarlet shilling and turned it into a buoy bobbing in the harbour			2
@entity34 told a fellow @entity5 member : ‘ he has been here and fired a gun			1
’ what he meant , of course , was that this last - minute dash of elan — of sheer , breathtaking colour — was tantamount to an act of sabotage against his own painting hanging alongside			0
the exhibition was a disaster for @entity34			2
even his friend the painter @entity118 pronounced @entity35 : ‘ very unfinished , sir			0
’ the @entity120 critic wrote : ‘ what a piece of plaster it is ! ’ then , adding insult to injury : ‘ mr @entity34 appears to think he is a @entity61			1
’ if @entity34 did not already loathe @entity61 , there is no doubt he did from that moment on			1
@entity61 seems to have detested @entity34 with equal force			1
this month , the rivals will be pitted against each other once again in two blockbuster exhibitions			0
in one corner of the ring is @entity135 at @entity136 ; in the other , ‘ @entity137 at the @entity138			1
city of @entity140 , 64 , going to @entity141 , 1832 ( oil on canvas ) by @entity61 ( 1775 - 1851 ) the two artists , pioneers of a revolutionary style of landscape painting , were opposites in birth , looks and temperament			1
@entity61 , born in @entity151 in 1775 to a father who had a wig - trimming and barber ’s business , was a monomaniac who preferred his palette and brushes to the convivial company of the dinner table			1
a @entity160 , who knew @entity61 in his youth when he stayed with her uncle near @entity163 , disobligingly described him as ‘ singular and silent			2
careless and slovenly in his dress			0
anything but a nice - looking young man			0
’ it is an image captured so brilliantly by the actor @entity169 in a new film about the painter that he won the @entity173 at this year ’s @entity174			0
@entity61 cared little what others thought of him			2
when a fellow member of the @entity5 , sir @entity178 , called him ‘ a little reptile ’ , he replied coolly that he was ‘ a great reptile — with ill manners ’			1
he never married , but lived with his ageing father , who was always catching cold			2
@entity61 affectionately called him ‘ @entity185 ’ even into middle - age			1
constable was a country lad			0
born in 1776 , he grew up in @entity187 , still known today as @entity188			0
his father , an affluent miller , was keen his son should continue the family business rather than pursue the precarious living of a painter			0
while @entity61 was just 15 when he first exhibited at the @entity5 , @entity34 was nearly 40			1
the scene at @entity195 where @entity34 painted the @entity196 , as it is today unlike bachelor @entity61 , @entity34 was happily married to @entity198 , the granddaughter of a @entity187 neighbour			1
he fervently believed his artistic success depended on her love			0
‘ all my hopes and prospects in life , ’ he wrote to her , ‘ are included in my attachment to you			0
’ they had seven children , and @entity34 ’s friend and biographer @entity211 recalled that the babies were as often in their father ’s arms as their mother ’s			1
what the rivals had in common was an astonishingly vivid new way of looking at landscape			0
while artists of the previous generation had set out to paint the landscape with topographical accuracy , @entity61 and @entity34 wished to capture its spirit			1
@entity61 painted tumultuous storms over harbours , blazing fires , the smoke and steam of the new industrial age			1
he thrilled to weather at its wildest and most violent			0
this recklessness is evidenced in an account given by a @entity238 newspaper editor of a boat trip with @entity61 off the coast of @entity241			2
while the other passengers suffered crippling sea - sickness in the ‘ boisterous ’ waters , @entity61 sat in the stern muttering admiringly : ‘ that ’s fine ! fine ! ’ constable was intensely interested in the quality of light : the way scudding clouds cast shadows over fields , the haze after a downpour , late afternoon sun on a riverbank			1
he proudly wrote of his delight in decay and neglect : ‘ @entity261 rotten banks , slimy posts and brickwork — i love such things			0
’ @entity266 and @entity267 was donated to the @entity138 by @entity34 's daughter @entity268 in 1888 they might have found much to admire in each other ’s work , but @entity61 saw @entity34 as a young pretender with an eye on his crown			1
to @entity34 , @entity61 was a king to be toppled			1
the @entity5 , to which they both belonged , was a cauldron of ego , resentment , back - stabbing , in - fighting , factions , cronies and coups			2
when @entity34 first began to exhibit in @entity2 , he eagerly took to scheming , politicking and alliance - making			2
he was delighted when in 1803 , @entity61 , who had been feted as a ‘ genius ’ the previous year , had an unsuccessful exhibition			2
one of the reviews said @entity61 ’s seas looked like ‘ soap and chalk ’ , and enemies piled in with their own criticisms			2
at one party , wealthy patron sir @entity292 was scathing about @entity61 ’s ‘ blots ’			2
constable , perhaps hoping to toady to @entity292 , chimed in with his view that @entity61 ’s technique was extravagant and inattentive to detail			2
when @entity34 was finally elected an associate of the @entity5 in 1820 , after a long - fought campaign , he must have been sorely put out when one of the senior academicians took him to one side and advised him to make a study of @entity61 if he wanted to improve his own technique			1
at times , the rivalry descended into pettiness and schoolboy insults			0
in his new book about the 19th - century art market , a @entity312 , the art historian @entity309 quotes a letter from the painter @entity314 to @entity34 , asking if it was true that @entity34 had said that ‘ @entity61 ’s pictures are only fit to be spit upon ’			1
if only we had @entity34 ’s reply			2
@entity61 , for his part , could be just as childish			0
while making plans for a sailing trip with his friend @entity211 , @entity61 discovered that @entity34 had been a guest at the house just a few days earlier and had put up the boat ’s sail			1
@entity34 's painting sold for £ 23.1million ‘ what does he know about ships ? ’ scoffed @entity61			1
‘ this is how it ought to be			0
’ he immediately started untying and retying the knots on the boat , which to @entity211 had looked perfectly ‘ ship - shape ’ as they were			0
when it came to the @entity5 exhibitions , @entity61 had an unnerving habit of looking over the shoulders of fellow painters and suggesting alterations			1
you can imagine the rage constable must have felt at @entity61 ’s last - minute stunt with the scarlet buoy			2
as the two major exhibitions open , art historians and gallery visitors will again ask the question : which is the greater artist ? the tempest - tossed @entity61 , or the romantic constable of rainstorms and sudden sunshine ? if there is one defining difference , it is this : stand in front of a painting by @entity34 and you are instantly cast back to late summer in the country , when the wildflowers were thirsty and toppling over in the heat and the harvested fields were as gold as ingots			1
or to an afternoon walk on an october weekend when the rain cleared and the sun shone and you thought you might keep on for another mile because the light was so unexpectedly bright and clear			0
there is a nostalgia to @entity34 , who reminds you of the @entity376 landscape at its most beautiful and beckoning			1
with @entity61 , there is something else			0
constable — for all his own technical verve — reminds you of the landscape as you have seen it , @entity61 makes you feel it then and there with blustery immediacy			2
a @entity61 painting whips you up in its storms and lashes you with its winds			0
the salt and spray from the waves settle on your lips , the steam and coal dust from his rattling trains make your eyes itch			0
and when he paints the @entity400 caught in a raging fire , the heat , felt even across the @entity402 , even across the centuries , leaves your cheeks glowing and your skin prickling from the blaze .			0

the two artists were opposites in birth , looks and temperament
