@entity11 @entity3 , 43 , was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work for taking £ 50 from @entity13 which provides scooters for disabled clients			1
but within hours of leaving court she posted on her profile : ' 80 hours community service ha bloody ha			2
' @entity3 - who still protests her innocence - then used offensive language to describe her former employer			1
she defiantly refused to apologise today and claimed she was poking fun at the system rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence			1
she said : ' i am not sorry because i have not done anything wrong			2
i posted on @entity7 " ha bloody ha " because i think it is ridiculous			2
' @entity3 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , worked at the charity ’s branch in @entity34 where bosses spotted irregularities with the accounts			1

we all knew it could only be one person who could have done it			0

they were all friends and she has let us all down			0
' we do n’t have a lot of cash and we are struggling			0
