grief is not a mental illness that should be treated with anti-depressants , experts say			1
in an unsigned editorial in the influential medical journal @entity7 , experts argue that grief does not require psychiatrists and that ' legitimising ' the treatment of grief with antidepressants ' is not only dangerously simplistic , but also flawed			1
' the debate follows a decision by the @entity15 to classify grief as a mental illness in a bid to allow to doctors to be more flexible about how early patients can be treated for depression after the death of a loved one			1
bereaved not ill : a controversial decision to reclassify grief as a mental illness has been criticised by medical experts in @entity7 ( file photo ) the lead editorial states : ' grief is not an illness ; it is more usefully thought of as part of being human and a normal response to the death of a loved one			1
' the @entity7 's comments follow the @entity15 's decision to add grief reactions to their list of mental illnesses in their fifth edition of the psychiatry ' bible ' , @entity43 , ( @entity45 ) , which is due out in 2013			1
but @entity7 , along with many psychiatrists and psychologists have called for the changes to be halted - saying they would lead to a ' tick box ’ system that did not consider the wider needs of patients but labelled them as ' mentally ill ’			2
they agree that in rare cases , bereavement will develop into prolonged grief or major depression that may merit medical treatment			1
however , they suggested that for the majority of the bereaved , ' doctors would do better to offer time , compassion , remembrance and empathy , than pills			2
' the @entity45 proposal - which has been opposed by @entity7 's editorial writers - would eliminate the so - called ' grief exclusion			1
' this ' exclusion ' means that anyone who has experienced bereavement can not be diagnosed as depressed for a certain period of time			0
in a previous edition , @entity43 , that period of time was set at one year			0
the @entity43 reduced that period to two months and @entity45 plans to reduce the period to just two weeks			0
the unsigned lead editorial reads : ' grief is not an illness ; it is more usefully thought of as part of being human and a normal response to the death of a loved one ' ( file photo ) although the proposed changes to the fifth edition of the @entity43 ( @entity45 ) would not directly affect clinical practice here , where doctors tend to use different international guidelines , experts say it would eventually influence research and thinking in the field			1
defending the change in timeframe , dr. @entity97 , a member of the @entity98 , said it would allow for an earlier diagnosis but would by no means force it			0
@entity105 , of the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , said ' we need to be very careful before further broadening the boundaries of illness and disorder			2
' ' back in 1840 the @entity113 included just one category for mental disorder			2
' by 1917 the @entity15 recognised 59 , rising to 128 in 1959 , 227 in 1980 , and 347 in the last revision			1
do we really need all these labels ? probably not			0
and there is a real danger that shyness will become social phobia , bookish kids labelled as @entity123 ’s and so on			0
’ ' grief is not an illness ; it is more usefully thought of as part of being human and a normal response to the death of a loved one ' whereas people who are bereaved are currently given help where necessary , in future they might find themselves labelled as having a depressive disorder if their symptoms lasted longer than a certain period of time , he added			1
@entity139 , professor of @entity140 and @entity141 , @entity142 , said ' it will exacerbate the problems that result from trying to fit a medical , diagnostic , system to problems that just do n’t fit nicely into those boxes			0
' perhaps most seriously , it will pathologise a wide range of problems which should never be thought of as mental illnesses			2
many people who are shy , bereaved , eccentric , or have unconventional romantic lives will suddenly find themselves labelled as ' mentally ill ’			0
dr. @entity154 , a @entity155 psychiatrist , social anthropologist and global health expert , says that the main problem is the lack of ' conclusive scientific evidence to show what a normal length of bereavement is			0
' according to the @entity7 writers , ' it is often not until 6 months , or the first anniversary of the death , that grieving can move into a less intense phase			0
' they added that grieving is individual , shaped by age , gender , religious beliefs and the strength of the relationship with the lost loved one .			0

treatment of grief with antidepressants is ' dangerously simplistic ' , experts say
*backlash* follows the @entity15 's reclassification of grief as a mental illness
