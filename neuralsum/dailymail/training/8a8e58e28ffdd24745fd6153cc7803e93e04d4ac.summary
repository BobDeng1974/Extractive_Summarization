by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 9 january 2013 a four - year - old boy is taking his first steps after undergoing an expensive private operation to overcome tightness in his muscles			2
@entity6 was diagosed with cerebral palsy after having a brain scan when he was 18 - months - old and has only been able to walk using a frame			1
at the start of 2012 his parents started a fundraising campaign to pay for a special procedure to loosen his legs as it is not routinely available on the @entity16			1
however , they had to redouble their efforts after callous thieves stole money from their fund			1
he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 18months			1
he is already sleeping better since he had the operation a few weeks ago the lively youngster went in for the operation at the @entity26 in @entity27 on december 11			2
he has now been at home for 10 days and his delighted parents say they have already seen an improvement in his condition			2
his father @entity32 , 31 , said : ' straight away we saw the difference , immediately he was sleeping better			0
selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be ' transmitting ' properly are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			2
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the @entity67 : @entity68 ' we wo n't see the real results yet but all @entity72 's spasticity has gone and he 's not tight anymore			2
he used to be really tight in the groin , hamstrings and calves but that 's gone now			0
' he is not in any pain anymore and is sleeping a lot better			0
he has got lots of dexterity in his hands and is eating by himself with a knife and fork			0
' he could n't hold a pen properly before and would hold it like a baby would a crayon but now he can hold a pen			0
' we did n't expect it to be so obvious			0
just the fact he is having a good night 's sleep is worth the effort for us			0
' the main thing for us was for @entity6 to have the freedom and dignity to be able to take himself to the toilet and i am happy with that			1
' @entity102 and @entity103 wanted their son to have a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy			0
it involves cutting faulty nerve endings in the spinal cord in order to loosen the legs and make them more agile			1
however , they faced the mammoth task of raising £ 35,000 for the operation after they were told their local @entity118 would not pay for it			1
disaster then struck last august after £ 1,400 from the charity fund was stolen after callous thieves broke into a community centre safe			1
mr @entity6 , @entity125 's father , said at the time he was ' gutted that one or two people have let everyone down like this '			1
but the determined family redoubled their efforts and had raised the amount in time for @entity133			2
@entity6 with his proud parents @entity102 and @entity103 : he should be able to walk unassisted in the coming months following intense physiotherapy this cctv shows the moment two heartless thieves stole £ 1,400 from a charity saving for an operation to help @entity6 walk the postman added that his son could now cross his legs which meant he would be able to sit with the other children at school rather than on a chair away from the rest of his class			1
@entity102 , a postman , said : ' it is the little things like that			0
people think of the operation as a miracle cure for walking but it is also about giving him the chance to be like every other child			0
' @entity6 when he was just a couple of hours old			1
his spasticity has gone since his operation according to his father @entity6 is building up the strength in his legs to help him walk and he is doing physiotherapy every day			1
his parents have also been taking the youngster swimming and cycling so that the work is more fun			2
@entity102 said the family is so appreciative to all the people who helped their son have the surgery and wanted to send his thanks to as many people as possible			1
but he also hopes that successful operations on youngsters like @entity6 will be taken into account when funding of @entity181 is reconsidered			1
he said : ' i ca n't see how they ca n't say it is justified after the success on a number of @entity187 , where they have been doing it for 25 years			0
' i think it should be available on the @entity16 , or at least there should be some help			0
' it 's massive , who would n't pay £ 35,000 for being able to get a good night 's sleep for 70 years or so , or being able to go to the toilet by yourself			1
children do n't choose to have cerebral palsy			1
' and he has probably cost £ 35,000 already in terms of mobility cars and his wheelchair			2
