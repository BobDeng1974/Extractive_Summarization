@entity0 , 18 , had lost half his body weight and was suffering from partial blindness brought on by his ordeal when he was found , lying exhausted , by two hikers			1
his body was covered in leeches and insect bites , with gangrene eating into his feet and lower legs			1
but the astonishing survival of the accountancy student , who lived with his family less than two miles from where he was found , has divided opinion in the local community			1
some have questioned his story , while others have simply marvelled at his endurance			0
police say @entity0 suffers from an unspecified mental illness , but that there is no doubt from his shocking condition that he has been living rough since he left his home in @entity31 , on the northern edge of @entity33 , last november			1
@entity0 is believed to have set out into the dense bush on a survival mission , where he struggled to exist on virtually no food and the little water he could gather from a virtually - dry creek bed			1
to make matters worse there was a record - breaking heatwave			2
police chief @entity42 said : ‘ he was not living under any shelter and was exposed to the full conditions since he was reported missing two months ago			0
‘ anyone who is missing for that length of time in those kind of conditions … you would n’t expect to see them again			0
’ @entity0 , who had lost six stone , was found by chance on saturday as he lay near a track in the bush , too exhausted and sick to raise himself on to his infected feet			1
he was badly dehydrated , his body was red with mosquito bites , leeches clung to his arms and legs and he was completely disorientated			2
incredible survival : despite his emaciated condition , experienced bush walkers and police are in awe of his ability to have survived virtually without any sustenance since november in the wilderness near @entity69 - during a record - breaking heatwave a helicopter was sent to winch him out of the bush and fly him to hospital in @entity69 , a suburb of @entity33			1
@entity0 ’s family have gathered at his bedside in hospital , where he is being treated for his injuries			2
police have described them as ‘ not life - threatening ’ , but added that if @entity0 had not been found by chance he would not have survived for many more days			1
his mother @entity81 said that her family ’s priority now ‘ is getting @entity0 well ’			2
she declined to comment further			0
police said the boy intended to go into the bush , and did not get lost there			0
when his family reported him missing a widespread search was carried out but the teenager could not be found			2
he had left his mobile phone at home and had not taken any extra clothing with him			2
discovery : @entity0 was found near @entity69 , a suburb of @entity33 on the edge of the outback officers have yet to question @entity0 about his ordeal but they believe he had deliberately stayed out of sight when hikers passed close by			1
inspector @entity42 said : ‘ hikers often walk along tracks in the area			0
he must have kept out of the way of people			0
‘ i also think he was in such a state that he could n’t actually get up and move			0
he was not that far from home but there ’s no indication that food was being pilfered from the house			0
’ some local people have questioned why @entity0 was not found earlier , when he was eventually discovered so close to home			1
one writer on an internet forum that has been debating his survival wrote : ‘ i find it all a bit odd			0
there ’s more to this story			0
’ but @entity119 said the bush is ‘ pretty rugged and you can be just around the corner from someone and never know that they ’re there ’ .			0
