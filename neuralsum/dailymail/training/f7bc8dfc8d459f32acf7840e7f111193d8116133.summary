while the @entity16 climbed to 12th place as a result , @entity6 are now just a point outside the drop zone and will fall into the bottom three if @entity21 get a draw or better against @entity23 on sunday			0
@entity0 celebrates his second and @entity4 's third as @entity1 's side fight back from two - goals down at @entity26 @entity0 grabs his second of the game despite the attempted block from @entity6 player @entity30 at @entity26 it was a familiar feeling for both clubs			1
@entity4 came from behind to beat @entity33 last weekend while @entity6 were beaten 4 - 2 at @entity33 in the @entity34 on wednesday night having led 2 - 0			2
' it was a famous and fabulous victory , ' said @entity1 , who has now won three on the trot since leaving @entity37 to succeed @entity38 at @entity39			2
' we had to show tremendous qualities against a @entity6 side that were on their mettle			2
not just resilience but flair and bravery to pass the ball as well			0
@entity0 is an uncomplicated player , two good feet , quick , can finish			2
not much more you can ask for really ! ' @entity49 is congratulated by @entity50 and his fellow @entity4 teammates after his second - half goal for @entity53 , he now has an almighty job lifting his players off the floor after another massive disappointment			1
' i did n't feel comfortable at 2 - 0 , ' he admitted			0
' we were just below - par for some reason			0
we did n't have our usual technical bravery			0
' a sharp , sudden snowstorm greeted both sets of players as they stepped out at @entity26 and @entity6 treated @entity4 as southern softies in the first 18 minutes as they raced into a two - goal lead			1
@entity4 striker @entity0 halves @entity6 's advantage with just under 30 minutes gone in the @entity69 clash @entity71 's corner looped over @entity4 goalkeeper @entity72 allowing @entity73 to head in from close range after losing his marker @entity76 in the 12th minute			1
six minutes later , @entity77 was robbed by @entity78 by the touchline as he tried to usher the ball out for a throw			0
he fed @entity82 and the @entity83 under - 21 striker finished low past @entity72			2
@entity1 was unhappy with both goals			2
' the corner was n't taken from the quadrant for the first , and the officials did n't see their player ( @entity78 ) dump our defender on the pitch , they were concentrating on whether the ball had crossed over the touchline , ' he said			0

@entity143 and @entity0 swapped flanks and it worked			0
@entity120 , now on the right nearly set up @entity117 to score after 28 minutes and though @entity71 got in a block , the ball fell to @entity0 who fired in			1
@entity1 approached referee @entity11 in the centre circle at half - time ' i did n't moan about the goals , it was because he would n't let us take a corner at the end of the half , ' explained the @entity4 manager			1
his players were just as fired up and after 48 minutes @entity4 were level , @entity6 defenders backing off as @entity49 received a pass from @entity0 and fired in from 20 yards			1
' i had punch at @entity164 and he is a different player now , he has that inner confidence from playing in the @entity69 , ' said the @entity4 boss			0
there was another late flurry of snow – and a late flurry of activity on the pitch too			0
@entity117 cleared off the line from @entity30 and then @entity4 substitute @entity119 , who had replaced disappointing debutant @entity50 , struck a post			0
then , with three minutes left , @entity119 used his body to help @entity49 's pass reach @entity0 at the far post			1
the forward 's take with his right foot was brilliant , and he then fired past @entity96 with his left			0
@entity49 smashes home to level the scores after @entity6 had cruised into a two - goal lead @entity4 boss @entity1 voices his opinions to referee @entity11 as they trudge off the pitch at half - time of the @entity69 clash @entity4 keeper @entity72 can only look on as @entity73 heads @entity6 's opener into an empty net @entity82 gives fans a glorious feeling as the @entity194 striker leaves them singing in the rain with a two - goal advantage @entity0 struggles to contain his delight as he runs to celebrate his late winner with the travelling @entity4 fans			1

@entity0 scored a late winner to *cap* a fine *turnaround* for @entity1 's @entity4
@entity73 and @entity82 had sent @entity6 well on their way to victory with two early goals at @entity26
but @entity0 halved the home side 's with 28 minutes of the first - half gone
@entity49 *equalised* in the second - half to set up a *grandstand* finish to the game
