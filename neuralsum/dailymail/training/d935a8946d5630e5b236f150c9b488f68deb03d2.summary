play for @entity0 at the @entity1 ? i need to learn how to play union first ! i hung up on @entity4 the first time he called i lived in an apartment owned by @entity4 and went to the beach every day ... my time in @entity8 was a dream my father 's death made me stronger ... he was my hero and i know he 'd be proud when @entity13 makes his debut for @entity15 on friday night at @entity16 , it will actually be the cross-code sensation ’s second game of union			1
the first did n’t go well			0
as a league - mad teenager , he had shown no inclination to try his hand at the 15 - man game , but after being talked into it , the experiment was short - lived			1
‘ i was about 14 and i went to @entity27 , near @entity28 , ’ he said			2
‘ i trained with them for a bit and had one game , because a couple of my mates from school were playing for them			0
i played fly - half			1
it was a cold , rubbish day and i just did n’t enjoy it			2
i did n’t get the ball very much and i was happy to stick with league			2
’ @entity15 's new signing @entity13 is set to make his debut on friday night against @entity41 fascination with the oval ball gripped @entity13 from an early age			1

’ yet , as was the case with union , his first match in league - at age five - did more to put him off than entice him			1
‘ i ’ll never forget it , ’ he said			0
‘ i was given the ball and i got tackled straight into a big puddle			0
it was freezing , i ran off crying and did n’t play again for a year			2
