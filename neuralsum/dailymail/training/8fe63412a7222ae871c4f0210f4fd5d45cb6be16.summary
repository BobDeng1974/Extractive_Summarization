by @entity0 published : 13:25 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 8 november 2013 while the likes of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are trying to make tablets smaller and thinner , @entity1 has decided to buck this trend with a giant touchscreen device			2
the @entity9 is a 20 - inch 4k tablet - almost three times the size of @entity3 ’s @entity12 - and runs @entity14 software			1
it also weighs over 5lbs , which is five times heavier than @entity5 ’s new @entity17 , but is just half an inch thick			1
@entity1 unveiled its @entity9 tablet , pictured , earlier this year and has now announced the 20 - inch device will go on sale in the @entity22 in january			1
@entity24 prices and release dates have n't been confirmed.the tablet 's screen is three times bigger than @entity3 's @entity12 , and it weighs five times more than @entity5 's @entity17 screen : 20 " resolution : 3,840 x 2,560 @entity31 : 230 processor : @entity33 i5 @entity34 memory : @entity36 storage : @entity38 battery life : two hours the huge size and screen also means the device comes with a two - hour battery life despite costing $ 5,999			1
@entity1 has n’t designed the tablet for consumers , though			0
instead it is aiming the device at hospitals , museums , architects and construction sites			0
it is called @entity9 because it has been made of reinforced glass fibre and has a magnesium alloy case			1
the 4k technology in the screen has been dubbed the next - generation in high - quality displays , and the @entity9 has a resolution of 3,840 x 2,560			2
this gives it a pixel - per - inch density of 230 , putting it slightly above the quality of @entity5 ’s 13 - inch @entity61 the tablet additionally has an @entity64 processor , @entity65 of @entity66 and comes with @entity67 of built - in storage - the same amount offered on high - end @entity70 and @entity3 ’s 12.85 - inch @entity71			2

the 4k technology in the screen has been dubbed the next - generation in high - quality displays @entity80 , @entity81 ’s director of @entity82 said : ‘ this is as close as i ’ve ever seen to real life on a display			0
it literally is like looking out of the window			0
' @entity1 is also offering an @entity88 that works like a stylus , similar to @entity91 ’s @entity90			0
it is said to give 2,000 levels of pressure by using infrared signals and @entity95 to analyse and read the screen ’s individual pixels , making it highly accurate and responsive			0
@entity1 is not the first company to launch a 20 - inch device ; @entity101 recently launched a giant tablet called the @entity103 20			1
it is almost twice the weight of @entity1 's @entity9 , at 12.27lbs , and the screen resolution is 1,600 x 900 , yet because of the lower - quality features and age it costs a much cheaper $ 979			2
