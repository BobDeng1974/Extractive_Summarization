mr @entity0 , 45 , who took over from @entity23 last week as chairman of the far - right @entity1 , is himself a former soldier			1
on its website , the @entity1 claims to be a ‘ patriotic ’ party that recognises the ‘ huge sacrifice ’ of @entity6 servicemen and women , yet the @entity2 is the most potent symbol of @entity9 ’s militaristic past			1

mr @entity42 , who was a sapper in the @entity56 , said : ‘ the guards were brutal and hit us with their rifle butts for the slightest misdemeanour			0
‘ i am not a vindictive man but i do not have the authority to forgive and forget when so many of my comrades were so badly treated and thousands lie in war graves			0
