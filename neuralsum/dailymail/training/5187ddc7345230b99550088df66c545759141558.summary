and for those who feared @entity8 ’s regional accents may be dying out , take heart - as it appears they will be with us for a good few years yet			0
from the @entity14 brogue to the @entity16 lilt , new research shows local accents are actually getting stronger as people struggle to retain a sense of identity			1
experts had originally predicted that local dialects would die out in the last half century with the rise of social mobility - but the study shows the opposite is true			1
on the up : researchers at @entity29 in @entity30 have found accents are getting stronger researchers at @entity29 say people are now choosing to hang on to the way their parents and grandparents speak as a marker of local allegiance			1
they say accents no longer hold a stigma and instead allow people to feel more connected with where they were brought up			0
dr @entity41 of @entity29 , who lead the project , said : ‘ the implications of our research are far reaching , revealing how far people ’s relationships with linguistic variety have changed			1
‘ rather than being a mark of social stigma , people are choosing certain features of accent or dialect to mark an identity with a particular place , instead of with a particular social class or ethnic group			2
’ researchers found that many felt connected to their home and family through their accent ( stock image ) the study , on people living in the @entity66 , showed many chose to use dialect and accent forms deliberately and self - consciously			1
this finding is consistent with research undertaken by other researchers in the @entity8 in relation to those living in @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
the research indicates that drawing upon linguistic features of a particular variety , such as @entity83 @entity82 , cuts across ethnicity , gender and class boundaries			0
however , while speaking with a regional accent is socially acceptable in the world of entertainment and sport , the study found there is some snobbery in areas like education , the law and government			2
the @entity82 : speech and @entity100 project was set up to investigate and describe the range of accents and dialects of the @entity66 today			2
the research looked at the ways in which performers , including comedians , poets , and dramatists , used accent as a way of expressing a place identity			0
researchers attended 20 performances at local venues across the @entity66 and interviewed the performers as well as audience members			1
dr @entity118 added : ‘ the reasoning behind the project is to draw the wider public ’s attention to the change in people ’s relationships with linguistic variety			0
‘ this is not to say anything goes : a regional variation of @entity82 is linguistically just as rule governed as standard @entity82 , but with different rules , which in many cases can be traced back historically to @entity133 , a time pre-dating the emergence of standard @entity82			0
