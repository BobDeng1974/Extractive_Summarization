she could have at least bought of pair of pants that fit and the bride wore — a thong			0
ill - fitting , at that ! all those millions in the bank , and you ca n’t even get a pair of pants to fit you right			2
big things were expected from the wedding of heiress @entity12 to her boyfriend of five minutes @entity14			1
and in the end , the event held in the @entity17 did not disappoint			0
@entity12 ’s all - white beach party was less @entity19 than cr * * sbyesque , but i loved the way she thundered around in her thong , drank shots , groin - danced with a pal and threw herself into the sea			1
it was just like a hen party in @entity28 , only with slightly nicer wine and less vomit			0
and we must all wish @entity12 well			1
despite all that loot , the bouffant - haired socialite has n’t had it easy ! she may have found love with @entity36 , but think of the humiliation dished out by long - standing boyfriend @entity38			2
he was filmed having sex with someone else , while wearing love tokens — bracelets and jewellery — that @entity12 had given him			1
so what did she do in revenge ? she did what all girls like her do — she got a tattoo			0
so empowering ! that ’ll show him			0
@entity12 turned to @entity52 , another doomed dame who was a disastrous chooser of men , for inspiration			1
@entity57 looked more like a hen party in @entity28 but with less vomit and nicer wine on her shoulder , she now has a tattoo of a quote from the @entity65 legend , which reads : ‘ sometimes good things fall apart so better ones can fall together			0
’ it is what any shallow heiress would deem as profound			2

heiress wed former banker on *tuesday* in front of 150 *guests* at the @entity81 *'s* most *luxurious* hotel
@entity12 drank shots , groin - danced with a pal and threw herself into the sea
