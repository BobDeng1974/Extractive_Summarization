by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 05:22 est , 20 august 2012 one of the first major studies of ' @entity2 ' has revealed that the nuisance outbreaks can occur anytime in the space of a month			1
the @entity5 asked members of the public to cover their mouths and keep a record each time they saw the pesky insects take to the air in their annual battle to find a mate			1
@entity14 , an ecologist and insect expert at the @entity16 , led the call to arms , and discovered that the outbreaks could come anytime over the period of a month			1
it was previously assumed the ants synchronised their swarms to increase their reproductive chances , but instead of the ' friday night ' approach , is appears there is a more complex pattern at play			1
swarming : the most common flying ants seen at the moment is the black garden ant , @entity32 more than 4,000 people responded to the survey across june and july , and their sightings reveal that even within a small town can have outbreaks on different days			1
@entity14 told @entity38 : ' it ’s really too early to tell but even a casual glance at the data so far shows that flying ant emergence is a spatially and temporally complex event			2
' the data so far suggest that there certainly is n’t a single ‘ flying ant day , ’ even within the same small town			1
' the outbreaks occur when male ants and females - potential queens - head to the skies to find a partner			2
by far the most common flying ants seen at the moment is the black garden ant , lasius niger			2
the ants we see throughout the year are workers ( sterile females ) , but flying ants are males and new queens undergoing their nuptial flight			2
sadly for the males , they die soon after , while the females go on to build new colonies			2
swarming : the most common flying ants seen at the moment is the black garden ant , @entity32 @entity68 can live for around 10 - 15 years and only mate once			1
having mated , a new queen will drop her wings then start her own colony			0
once she has dug a nest she will lay her first eggs , and use her wing muscles for energy until the first workers are ready to forage			0
over the next few years she will keep laying eggs and her colony will typically reach 5,000 workers , but some grow to have 15,000			0
@entity14 added : ' these sorts of large scale data can only be collected if you have a large number of observers , and this means that a " citizen science " approach is the ideal method			0
' i was surprised to get quite so many responses from the public and quite so much press and media attention			0
' so far this has led to well over 4,000 responses , and this tally increases daily			1
' despite its size , the black garden ant has a huge impact on our countryside , from improving soil to pollination and pest control			0
they are also important as food ; many people are alerted to the presence of flying ants by the sound of feasting gulls			0
the @entity5 plans to make this an annual survey , to help understand how and why the timing of emergence changes year on year			1
much of what we know about ants comes from experiments which scientists can perform			0
collecting information about ant emergences around the @entity123 , however , relies on lots of people submitting their records			0
the @entity5 is asking everyone who sees flying ants in 2012 to make a note of the time , date , location and weather conditions , and submit records through an online survey www.societyofbiology.org/flyingantsurvey			1
anyone who takes photos of flying ants can share them by emailing @entity136 ( flyingants2012@gmail.com ) , or share on @entity137 using the hashtag # flyingantsurvey			0
@entity139 tagged ‘ flyingantsurvey ’ on @entity140 will be also be uploaded to the @entity140 group .			0

survey led by @entity16 discovers there is no single day for swarming nuisance
