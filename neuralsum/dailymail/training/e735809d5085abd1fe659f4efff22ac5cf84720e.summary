a diner who asked for a ‘ doggy bag ’ to take home her half - finished meal was surprised to be asked to sign a legal waiver			1
the complicated form is being issued to customers at a restaurant part - owned by celebrity chef @entity9 before they can take any of their food away with them			1
@entity14 in @entity15 refused to allow the diner to take home her unfinished tarte flambee – a pizza - style dish – before she agreed to indemnify them ‘ from and against all claims , losses , liabilities , damage , costs , charges , fines , penalties and expenses ’ that could arise from her eating it at home			1
suprised : @entity34 ( left ) was asked to sign a disclaimer when she asked to take home her unfinished tarte flambee from @entity14 in @entity15 , which is part - owned by celebrity chef @entity9 ( right ) the restaurant said the document was designed to stop diners from suing it if they took the £ 11.80 dish home , failed to store or refrigerate it properly and became ill. but managers admitted they had never been sued			1
@entity34 , 31 , from @entity46 , said : ‘ i was having sunday lunch with my boyfriend and did n’t manage to finish my main course , so thought i ’d take it away to eat on my way home			2
‘ but when i asked the waitress to wrap it up she said i had to sign a waiver			2
i did it without thinking , but the more i thought about it , the more ridiculous it seemed			0
it is a completely pointless bit of paperwork			0
i only wanted to take away the tart that i was already eating			0
’ written in convoluted legalistic jargon – and bad @entity63 – the ‘ indemnity form ’ asks diners to ‘ confirm that i will be taking away [ the food or drink ] into the house / home ( “ the premises ” ) for the consumption ( “ function ” ) ’			1
it continues : ‘ i and my guests will then be able to consumer [ sic ] this food or drink			0
’ but the diner must fulfil two requirements			2
firstly , they must ‘ ensure that all applicable licensing laws are complied with ’ and ‘ ensure that no sales of liquor are made on the premises ’			0
waiver : @entity34 had to agree to indemnify the restaurant ' from and against all claims , losses , liabilities , damage , costs , charges , fines , penalties and expenses ' that could arise from her eating it at home secondly , they must : ‘ observe and comply with all legal requirements relating to food and its preparation , food safety and health and safety , together with any other requirements affecting catering premises and / or premises for the preparation of food ( as defined by the @entity108 , whether statutory or otherwise ) and all new relating regulation			1
’ @entity14 said the form is a standard one provided by environmental health officers and used by many restaurants			1
a spokesman said : ‘ although we do n’t have to use it , staff are strongly recommended to as we do n’t have a licence to serve takeaway food			0
’ restaurant critic @entity121 , co-founder of @entity121 ’s @entity122 guides , said : ‘ i would never ask for a doggy bag in the first place			2
but even if i were to , i do n’t see the use of this form			0
‘ i ’ve never heard of such a thing			0
this is just more nonsense designed to interfere with the operation of common sense			0
