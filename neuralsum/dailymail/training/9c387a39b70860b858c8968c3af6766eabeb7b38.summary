published : 19:47 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 05:10 est , 24 august 2012 the man who was @entity2 treasurer when the party accepted almost £ 500,000 from corrupt @entity5 tycoon @entity4 , said last night that @entity6 was under a ‘ moral duty ’ to give the money back			1
as @entity4 began a ten - year jail term for looting almost £ 29million from the collapsed company , @entity11 , a scion of the construction dynasty , said the cash should be paid to @entity4 ’s creditors , some of whom lost their life savings			1
‘ it is tainted money and it shames the conservatives if they hang on to it			2
they have a moral duty to give it back , ’ he said			0
' moral duty ' : former @entity2 treasurer @entity11 ( left ) has called on @entity6 to give back the £ 500,000 donated by jailed @entity5 tycoon @entity4 ( right ) the money was paid to the @entity2 between 1985 and 1990 when @entity26 was prime minister and leader of the @entity2			1
senior figures from @entity26 ’s administration last night insisted that she would repay the money if she was still leader of the party			1
@entity4 , 71 , was one of @entity33 ’s most prominent businessmen in the 1980s , only to become one of the most notorious fugitives from justice when he fled @entity33 for northern @entity37 in 1993 while awaiting trial			2
his conviction at the @entity40 on wednesday prompted immediate calls for the @entity42 to return the estimated £ 440,000 they received from @entity4 ’s collapsed @entity5 company			1
going down : an artist 's impression of the moment @entity4 is sentenced to ten years in jail for stealing £ 29million from his @entity5 empire @entity49 , the @entity5 administrator , has written a letter to @entity52 claiming at least £ 365,000 can be identified as money stolen from the company by @entity4			1
the @entity42 last night indicated that they would hold on to the cash – worth £ 860,000 in today ’s figures – even though the then party chairman @entity57 told the @entity58 in 1993 : ‘ obviously if it is proved that the money was stolen it will be returned			1
’ the intervention of @entity11 , speaking to the @entity60 from his home in @entity63 , will ratchet up the pressure on the party to surrender the cash			1
he said : ‘ when @entity4 gave the first donation to me , his @entity5 company had just won a @entity71			2
‘ he was a dashing figure who was admired across @entity74 for his business flair			0
no one thought for a second that he was bleeding his company dry through illicit means			0
but frankly the moment he fled the country in 1993 , to avoid criminal charges , it was obvious to me he was a complete conman			0
frankly , the @entity42 should have given the money back in 1993			1
‘ but today the case is even clearer			0
there is a moral imperative for the money to be returned			0
the money was not @entity4 ’s to give although we thought it was at the time			1
‘ therefore the @entity2 has a duty to return it			0
it will speak volumes about the character of the modern @entity2 if they do n’t do the right thing			0
i trust that @entity6 is an honourable man			0
’ tainted : @entity4 , pictured here while on the run in @entity37 , donated the money to the @entity2 between 1985 and 1990 when @entity26 was prime minister @entity11 , who was @entity2 treasurer from 1975 when @entity26 became leader until her fall in 1990 , said : ‘ i can tell you this : if @entity26 was still leader of the party i am absolutely certain she would have ordered the party to repay the lot			1
i can hear her barking down the phone : “ @entity110 , we ca n’t keep that man ’s money ”			0
’ the same view was echoed by @entity114 , who was @entity26 ’s private secretary at @entity115 , at the time of the dealings with @entity4			1
lord @entity114 said : ‘ my gut instinct tells me that @entity26 would have wanted that money repaid			1
’ however , former foreign secretary sir @entity120 said too much time had passed and that it would not be possible to show that the donated money had been stolen from @entity5			0
lord @entity114 sir @entity120 , who was in the @entity124 under @entity26 and is still an mp , said : ‘ it is very difficult to pick and choose when you are talking about money that was so many years ago			1
@entity4 was a rich man and had a great deal of personal wealth			2
‘ one would need to know a lot more about where the money came from before one could think about whether it should be handed back			0
’ from other @entity2 grandees there was a conspicuous silence			0
former @entity124 members such as @entity114 ( @entity140 ) @entity139 and @entity141 declined to comment			0
when @entity4 fled to @entity37 , the then prime minister sir @entity142 said : ‘ if it proves to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us , then of course we will return it			2
’ sir @entity142 was overseas and not available for comment			0
meanwhile , a @entity149 mp has written to @entity2 co-chairman @entity150 to demand the party hands the @entity4 cash back			2
@entity153 , mp for @entity154 , wrote : ‘ the conviction of @entity4 raises the matter of his donations to the @entity2			2
‘ sadly ... the initial response of the @entity2 , very soon after the conviction of @entity4 , was to say that the money would not be repaid			2

@entity11 said the £ 440,000 should be paid to @entity4 's creditors
@entity42 last night indicated they would hold on to the cash – worth £ 860k in today 's figures
