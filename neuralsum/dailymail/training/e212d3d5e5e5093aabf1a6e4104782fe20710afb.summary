@entity0 risks riling @entity1 before thursday ’s showdown by claiming the @entity4 striker can not yet claim to be true world class			1
the @entity7 manager says @entity1 , who scored 31 times for @entity9 in the @entity11 last season and was @entity12 , can not be mentioned in the same class as true greats such as @entity15 or @entity16 until he performs wonders at the @entity18			1
@entity1 is expected to start for @entity4 in the crunch clash with @entity7 in @entity20			1
speaking after @entity7 ’s 2 - 1 defeat against @entity22 , @entity0 said : ‘ he ( @entity1 ) will only be at that level when he shows it on this particular stage			1
not quite there : @entity0 says @entity1 still has a way to go to be considered one of the world 's best brave : the @entity7 manager is awaiting @entity4 and @entity1 in the next @entity32 game ‘ if you are saying “ do i think he has got the potential , is he a wonderful footballer ? ” , yes he sure is			1
but if you are really going to put him up there with @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity37 and @entity38 , you might argue @entity39 needs to have that sort of tournament to get up there with the legends			1
‘ @entity44 is challenging that category			0
he has done it time and again , shown what a wonderful footballer he is because this is the stage you have to do it on			2
‘ being a great player in your league will get you lots of plaudits but for the world to recognise you are one of the all - time greats you have to do it at the @entity18			1
’ @entity1 has been recovering from injury and watched @entity4 ’s opening game , a 3 - 1 defeat against @entity58 , from the substitutes ’ bench			1
he will be desperate to face an @entity7 team which is likely to include five of his @entity9 team - mates			1
@entity0 turned his attention to @entity4 yesterday after the @entity7 team flew back to @entity65 from @entity66			1
frustrating : @entity1 , carrying an injury , was forced to watch on as @entity4 lost to @entity58 on saturday key man : @entity1 was in superb form for @entity9 last season , notching 31 @entity11 goals @entity0 insists he will not panic but he admitted it is impossible to condition his young @entity7 stars to become world beaters overnight			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we will try to cheer the players up , show them some of the things in the game that were very good and address some of the issues that need to be addressed			1
‘ but in my time with the national team , that is the most positive performance in many ways that i have seen			0
‘ it gives me great hope going forward , not just for the next two games , because we have players who can all develop into very strong players			0
‘ you ca n’t really expect @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 [ to have ] the experience of @entity96 and @entity44			0
‘ we have to give them games			0
in a game which was very difficult i do n’t think they let anyone down			2
’ belief : @entity0 said his team can take plenty of pride from the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity22 in @entity66 encouraging : @entity90 scored @entity7 's goal , a fine move in the first half @entity0 admitted @entity22 were more ruthless in front of goal and will demand more from his forward line against @entity4			1
@entity113 scored @entity22 ’s opener and @entity116 ’s 50th - minute header was enough for victory			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we were not outclassed but they were more ruthless at taking their chances			2
but the number of chances we created , even during the first half of the second half , should have given us an opportunity to score more than one goal			0
we have to be a bit more ruthless			0
‘ had we scored two or three goals i do n’t think anybody would have said “ you were lucky there ”			0
’ @entity0 also admitted he will work on the team ’s defensive vulnerability after @entity22 sliced through @entity7 ’s backline for their second goal			1
although the perceived weakness was at right back with @entity138 , @entity22 attacked down @entity7 ’s left flank			1
they exposed @entity140 , who had been shifted out there , and left - back @entity142			2
sloppy : @entity0 insisted his team will work on their defensive failures from the game @entity0 said : ‘ you ca n’t blame purely the left - back , we did n’t defend the area that well			1
we were playing very offensive wide midfield players , @entity140 , @entity91 and @entity89 , we are going to get caught in those areas from time to time , i ’m afraid			0
‘ we did much better second half defending it			0
the players gave their all			0
i certainly would n’t be prepared to go and blame anybody			0
‘ there were some sterling efforts , if you ’ll excuse the pun			0
it just was n’t good enough on the night			0
’ @entity0 was pleased with @entity89 ’s contribution and he has done more than enough to keep his place			2
@entity0 said : ‘ the more i work with him , the more i see			2
at the moment , i am very happy that we can have him in two positions			0
‘ we thought with his pace , ability and sharpness around @entity44 and @entity96 , it might help us nullify [ them ]			0
however hard you work against them , especially in this heat and humidity , they are going to get on the ball			0
’ @entity180 man : but on saturday night , @entity89 lit up the @entity18 with a fine match against @entity22 @entity0 has the option of using @entity183 on thursday after the @entity7 midfielder started ball work following the injury to his right knee			1
@entity0 added : ‘ i have the opportunity to make changes if i want , but i want to have a close look at the @entity22 game again			1
’ @entity7 ’s head physio @entity193 has returned home after he fractured an ankle celebrating @entity90 ’s equaliser			2
@entity193 , a popular member of the @entity7 set - up , jumped into the air and landed on a water bottle when @entity90 tucked away @entity140 ’s cross			2
@entity0 said : ‘ we will miss him			2
i am really sad for him but we can cover for him because we have extra physios			0
‘ for him to have such an unfortunate accident is really sad			0
we will miss him because he is very experienced , very popular , and close to the players and it was a heart - breaking moment			0

@entity0 says @entity1 is *n't* in same league as @entity16 or @entity15
also argues that @entity39 needs a fine tournament to reach that stage
