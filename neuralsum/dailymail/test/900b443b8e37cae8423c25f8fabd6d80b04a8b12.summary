@entity0 and his dad , @entity3 zookeper @entity2 , were digging for fossils near a grocery store when @entity0 found the dinosaur bones a five - year - old boy in @entity3 has had the once - in - a - lifetime opportunity of discovering 100million - year - old dinosaur bones while searching for fossils with his dad			1
@entity0 was digging with his dad , @entity2 , back in september at a construction site near a @entity16 , @entity15 , grocery store when he made the ancient discovery			1
' he walked up ahead of me and found a piece of bone , ' @entity3 zookeeper @entity0 said			1
' it was a pretty good size and i knew i had something interesting			0
' the pair had been finding fish vertebrae , but when @entity0 came back with the bone , @entity0 asked him to take him to where he found it , according to @entity29			0
and now , scientists from @entity31 have helped a @entity3 zookeeper and his 5 - year - old son excavate the fossil			1
@entity2 and his son @entity0 worked at the excavation site tuesday to dig up what paleontology professor @entity37 believes could be a nodosaur , a pony - sized dinosaur that dwelled on land			1
though @entity0 and @entity43 discovered the fossil last september , it took over seven months to obtain necessary permits to dig up the bones			1
scientists started digging last friday , according to the @entity48			0
at the time , the zookeeper , who often leisurely digs for fossils with his son , was not sure what @entity0 , then four years old , had found			1
@entity0 ( left ) and his dad @entity2 ( right ) often go on fossil - searching trips as a way to be outside and spend time together			1
it 's believed that the bones @entity0 found belong to a nodosaur , a a pony - sized herbivore with scaly , plated skin the two kept digging because they knew there was a chance of finding @entity67 period marine life remnants in the area			1
what they found was the nodosaur - meaning ' knobby lizard ' in @entity71			0
the lizards were 15 - foot - long , scaly - plated plant eaters that could weigh up to about 2,000 pounds according to the @entity74			2
' my dad told me it was a turtle , ' @entity0 said tuesday at the site of his discovery			2
' but now he 's telling me it 's a dinosaur			0
' university experts said it is rare to find a dinosaur in the @entity3 area			0
@entity0 , 5 , background , watches as @entity31 's @entity86 ( right ) supervises the removal of a dinosaur bones encased plaster from @entity16 , @entity15 on tuesday			1
university experts say it 's rare to find dinosaur remains in the @entity3 area the fossils were wrapped in burlap and plaster to create a protective shell around the bones , like a cast around a human 's broken bones			2
they will be transported to @entity31 for cleaning and assembly , which will likely take months , @entity37 said			2
he added that excavation will continue at the site for the next week or so before construction crews continue building in the area , but that it is unlikely for another dinosaur to be discovered at that site			0
@entity0 is n't expertly trained in searching for fossils , but he learned a few tips from the scientists			2
he and @entity43 collect fossils as something they can ' do together outside , ' @entity0 told @entity118			0
and @entity0 told the @entity119 that @entity0 is just like any other five - year - old			0
' he 's a little kid , ' @entity0 said			0
' he likes playing in dirt as much as finding the fossils , i think			0

@entity0 and his dad , @entity3 zookeeper @entity2 , were digging for fossils near a local grocery store when they made the discovery in september
after seven months , they acquired permits to dig up the bones
scientists from @entity31 are helping with excavation
fossils are expected for be from a nodosaur , a pony - sized herbivore with scaly , plated skin
