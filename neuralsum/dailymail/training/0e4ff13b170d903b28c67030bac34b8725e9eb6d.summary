built in : designer @entity28 built old @entity31 and @entity32 handsets sent in by @entity34 customers who no longer had a use for them designer , @entity28 said : ' i wondered how i could make phones that people might be embarrassed to be seen with into something that would give them a new lease of life – which is what upcycling is all about			1
recycle : the stylish new initiative aims to stop people binning their old phones ' i hoped that , by turning them into @entity16 , i would raise a smile and perhaps a laugh and create things that people wanted once again			1

' you may not end up with a @entity16 of your own , but at the very least you will get some cash in your pocket as we offer a cash sum to all those who recycle gadgets with us			0
' there ’s a huge environmental need to dig out old gadgets so they can be used again , rather than lying unused and unloved in the drawer			0
' whether functioning phones are sent on so that others can make use of them or they are stripped for their metals which can be used again , we ’ve all got a role to play in making sure that phones live on even when we ’ve finished with them			0
