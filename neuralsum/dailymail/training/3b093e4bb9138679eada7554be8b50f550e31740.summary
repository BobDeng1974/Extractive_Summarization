by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 11 september 2013 giant pandas could advance the development of biofuels thanks to microbes found in their faeces			1
a pair of pandas at @entity8 are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research , which aims to develop biofuels of the future			1
the pandas ' contribution could be added to by others from @entity17 as scientists endeavour to shift biofuel production away from corn and other crops that are grown to be eaten and to non-food plant material instead			1
a pair of @entity24 at @entity8 ( pictured ) are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research , which aims to develop superior biofuels of the future			1
@entity28 and @entity30 's faeces could help scientists work out how to shift biofuel production away from corn and other crops grown to be eaten @entity34 , of @entity35 , who is leading the research told the 246th @entity37 of the @entity38 , said that the pandas are giving their faeces to the study			1
' we have discovered microbes in panda feces might actually be a solution to the search for sustainable new sources of energy , ' she said			2
' it 's amazing that here we have an endangered species that 's almost gone from the planet , yet there 's still so much we have yet to learn from it			0
that underscores the importance of saving endangered and threatened animals			0
' she has identified more than 40 microbes living in the guts of giant pandas at the @entity8 that could make biofuel production from plant waste easier and cheaper			1
the research , professor @entity34 added , also may provide important new information for keeping giant pandas healthy			1
ethanol made from corn is the most common alternative fuel in the @entity68 but many fear that wide use of corn , soybeans and other food crops used for fuel production may raise food prices or lead to shortages of food			0
professor @entity34 pointed out that corn stalks , corn cobs and other plant material not used for food production would be better sources of ethanol			2
scientists are keen on developing biofuels from non-food plants but tough stalks can be expensive to process			0
professor @entity34 is examining bacteria that are highly efficient in breaking down lignocellulose and freeing up the material that can be fermented into ethanol and used in biofuels however , that currently requires special processing to break down the tough lignocellulose material in plant waste and other crops , such as switchgrass , grown specifically for ethanol production			1
breaking down this material is costly and requires a pretreatment step using heat and high pressure or acids			0
she and other scientists are looking for bacteria that are highly efficient in breaking down lignocellulose and freeing up the material that can be fermented into ethanol			0
bacteria in giant panda digestive tracts are prime candidates			0
not only do pandas digest a diet of bamboo , but they have a short digestive tract that requires bacteria with unusually potent enzymes for breaking down lignocellulose			0
professor @entity34 explained : ' the time from eating to defecation is comparatively short in the panda , so their microbes have to be very efficient to get nutritional value out of the bamboo			0
' and efficiency is key when it comes to biofuel production â€” that 's why we focused on the microbes in the giant panda			1
' working with scientists at the @entity138 , her team identified bacteria that break down lignocellulose into simple sugars , which can be fermented into bioethanol			0
as well as helping to advance biofuels , professor @entity34 said understanding the relationships between the microbes and the pandas is important for the endangered animals ' conservation			2
there are plans to expand the work to include samples from red pandas ( pictured ) at the @entity8 , which also eat bamboo they also found bacteria that can take those sugars and transform them into oils and fats for biodiesel production			2
professor @entity34 said either the bacteria themselves or the enzymes in them that actually do the work could be part of the industrial process			0
' these studies also help us learn more about this endangered animal 's digestive system and the microbes that live in it , which is important because most of the diseases pandas get affect their guts , ' she said			2
' understanding the relationships between the microbes and the pandas , as well as how they get their energy and nutrition , is extremely important from a conservation standpoint , as fewer than 2,500 giant pandas are left in the wild and only 200 are in captivity			1
' additional plans include expanding the work to include samples from red pandas at the @entity8 , which also eat bamboo .			2

pandas from @entity8 are are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research , which aims to develop biofuels of the future
a scientist has identified 40 microbes living in the guts of giant pandas that could make biofuel production from plant waste easier and cheaper
the research by @entity35 could also provide important new information for keeping giant pandas healthy
