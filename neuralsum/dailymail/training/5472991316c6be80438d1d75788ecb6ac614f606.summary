@entity0 may be a singing competition but whether they like it or not , the contestants are also judged on what they 're wearing			2
but they do n't just throw on any old thing before they take to the stage ; their whole look is carefully constructed with the help of a team of experts who work like a well oiled machine backstage			2
heading up the style squad is @entity13 , who has worked with the likes of @entity15 , and helps curate each and every look for the live shows			2
@entity19 were keen to find out the entire dressing process , who her favourite judge is and how she copes with @entity25 's criticism so we grilled the stylist on all things @entity0			1
criticism : @entity31 ' outfit came under fire this week after @entity25 said she looked like she was ' wrapped up in tape ' - so how does her stylist feel about that ? @entity19 grilled her on all things x factor on saturday night 's episode , @entity25 ticked off @entity39 with his critique of her wildcard @entity31 , who took to the stage and performed @entity43 's @entity44			1
' i really do n’t like what you ’re wearing , ' he frankly said afterwards			0
' i 'm gob - smacked			0
you just look like you 're wrapped up in tape			0
it ’s important that you dress how you want to and not how somebody else tells you to in order to become the artist you want to be			0
' style statement : @entity13 , the show 's lead stylist , hit back at @entity25 saying that @entity31 looked ' spectacular ' for her performance			1
talk to the hand : @entity25 and @entity39 clashed over @entity0 contestant @entity31 on saturday night 's episode of the show so how does @entity13 handle @entity25 's comments ? ' the creative brief for @entity31 was a dramatic production to support her big song , ' she told @entity63			1
' for her styling it was a case of fashion meets costume , the red dupioni silk gown with that 12ft train looked spectacular as she moved to centre stage , that was the money shot ! i believe that statement dress empowered @entity31 for her performance			2
' criticism is part of the show , this is a contest , and i 'm willing to take on board all the comments			0
' @entity80 is hugely subjective and you ca n't please everyone			1
' @entity83 : @entity13 loves working with @entity84 and describes her as ' enchanting like a modern day @entity86 with her platinum hair and ‎ rouge lips ' style guru : @entity13 has worked with @entity15 in the past and is honoured to be styling this year 's @entity0 contestants @entity13 believes that fashion is an ' emotional tool ' and if you look good , you feel good			1
' it 's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant 's heads , ' she said			2
' it is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so i want that to be translated in what they 're wearing			0
' she could n't be happier with the group , who make her job all the more enjoyable			2
' the contestants really are an amazing group , all very polite and from the beginning we have set a mutual understanding and respect			0
' despite public opinion , she does n't believe that @entity84 is a diva , instead explaining : ' it 's absolutely true what the judges say about @entity84 , she is enchanting and lofts about the studios like a modern day @entity86 with her platinum hair and ‎ rouge lips			1
' she is like my muse			0
on saturday night she dazzled in a @entity129 dress i customised for her			0
inspired by the drawings @entity133 did for @entity134 , we cut the neck line into a deeper v , added mesh with beadwork and two petticoat layers to create the flapper vibe ‎ she pulls off so well			0
' as well as the contestants , @entity13 works closely with the judges to discuss how they think their acts should dress for the live shows and she hugely admires both @entity39 and @entity147 's style			1
she said : ' the girls are gorgeous , they ooze glamour and go for the less is more look with block colours and clean lines			0
' @entity147 's make - up is exquisite but i simply could n't choose between the two as they 're both equally distinctive and stunning			1
' love your look : @entity13 says that she ca n't pick a favourite between @entity159 , left , and @entity160 - she thinks they 've both got their styling spot on			1

@entity13 is @entity0 's lead stylist

ca n't pick between @entity39 and @entity147 's style and loves them both
