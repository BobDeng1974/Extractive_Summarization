@entity1 was lethargic , short of breath and vomiting - so her mother @entity14 , 33 , rang the out - of - hours medical phone line for advice			1
the mother from @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , told a duty nurse her child 's symptoms and the medic prescribed @entity12			1

@entity1 , pictured aged 9 , with her friend @entity82			2
@entity39 's @entity38 heard how the child was vomiting and lethargic when her mother called the phone line for advice and a medic suggested @entity12 ' i did n’t know anything about septicaemia			1
it was n’t until they put her on a life support machine that they told us			2
' they told me if i had waited for an emergency doctor to come , she would have died			2

it was just a matter of hoping she would			0
' her feet were really black and her hands were too			0
you could tell they were actually gone			0
her hands were saved by all the stuff she was on - the nine machines around her			0
' @entity105 ’s barrister , @entity104 , said the company accepted that @entity1 ' should have seen by a gp ' within two hours of her mother ’s call but said the outcome would have been no different			1
