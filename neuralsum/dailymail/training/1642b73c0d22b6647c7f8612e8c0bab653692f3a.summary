the rationing body @entity9 has finally given the go ahead for @entity10 after the makers dropped the price			1
the drug treats diabetic macular oedema ( @entity15 ) , which affects around 50,000 @entity16 causing problems with reading , driving and recognising faces			1
@entity10 treats diabetic macular oedema ( @entity15 ) , which affects around 50,000 @entity16 eyesight causing problems with reading , driving and recognising faces this offers fresh hope for people with a serious and common complication of diabetes			1
currently laser treatment is used to stabilise the condition which if left untreated causes 30 per cent of patients to go blind			0
clinical trials show @entity10 , given as an injection in the eye , is the first treatment that can help reverse vision loss for some patients			2
but the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) last year said the drug was not ‘ a good use of @entity7 resources ’ at £ 750 for each monthly injection			1
four @entity16 charities failed in their appeal to stop the proposed ban , but @entity9 re-visited the decision after makers @entity46 cut the price by an undisclosed amount			1
@entity9 tried to ban @entity10 before , when it was initially licensed for another cause of blindness called wet age - related macular degeneration , or @entity52 , in 2007			1
it would have meant patients had to go blind in one eye first but @entity9 was forced into a u-turn after thousands of protests			2
@entity10 is one of the most costly drugs for the @entity7 , which spent £ 130 million on the treatment in 2010 , although patient access scheme for @entity52 patients capped the cost at £ 10,400 for 14 injections or more			2
complication : @entity15 , which affects around 50,000 @entity16 is related to diabetes however , consultant ophthalmologist @entity67 , from the @entity68 , @entity69 , said the drug was one of the great breakthroughs in eye disease			1
he said ‘ this has the impact of insulin , penicillin or steroids in our field			0
it prevents loss of vision and means older people at risk retain the ability to drive a car , and live independent lives			0
‘ up until now , most patients could only receive laser treatment on the @entity7 , which usually just stops their vision worsening but does not necessarily improve it			0
’ the drug is more effective than laser treatment , although that will still be used for some patients , he added			0
@entity96 , head of policy and campaigns at the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , one of the charities which appealed against the proposed ban , said at least 5,000 new diabetic patients a year could be eligible for the drug , which has a better chance of saving their sight than existing treatment			0
when injected into the eye , the drug also known as raniizumab , slows the leakage of small blood vessels in the retina			0
new drug : @entity15 is currently treated using lasers barring appeals , draft guidance from @entity9 will be confirmed in february , when local trusts will have to find funding for the treatment			2
@entity122 , chief executive of @entity123 , said ‘ we are delighted that @entity9 have reconsidered their previous decision , and that this draft guidance recommends that @entity10 is made available on the @entity7 , as this would mean more people with diabetes would have a better opportunity to preserve and possibly improve their vision			1
‘ we have campaigned vigorously for this outcome for the past two years and so welcome this result and hope this is reflected in the final guidance when it is issued next month			0
’ professor @entity137 , @entity138 at @entity9 , said ‘ @entity9 is pleased to recommend ranibizumab as a treatment option for some people with visual impairment caused by diabetic macular oedema in new draft guidance			1
‘ in november 2011 , @entity9 published guidance which did not recommend the drug as an effective use of @entity7 resources			2
‘ however , following the submission of a revised patient access scheme , we have conducted a rapid review of the original guidance			0
