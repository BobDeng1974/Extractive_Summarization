by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 will bring @entity2 back in from the cold next season after owner @entity4 made it clear the @entity6 manager must use all players at his disposal			1
the move represents a remarkable turnaround for the striker who was frozen out at @entity6 and part of the so - called @entity15 training separately from the first - team			1
@entity6 tried to offload @entity2 last summer but could not find any team to match their £ 8million valuation and in the end agreed a season - long loan move with @entity21 , who picked up his £ 65,000 per week wages			1
the 30 - year - old ’s return reflects the difficulty @entity1 will have in making signings during the transfer window this summer with the club up for sale and uncertainty about the future			1
@entity46 is another who should be back in contention for selection after missing the entirety of last season with an @entity53 injury and then failing to get fit , while @entity54 will also return if a buyer can not be found			1
@entity1 ’s previous tactic was to jettison those players on big wages he felt were of little benefit to team harmony but @entity4 wants to see money he has spent on the pitch with @entity2 the prime example			1
he arrived at @entity6 for an initial £ 18m in january 2011 and still has a year left on his contract			2
given @entity65 is out with an @entity53 injury until october at the earliest and @entity67 still needing to fully recover from a broken leg @entity6 ’ s striker situation is critical			2
@entity2 was nicknamed ‘ @entity72 ’ by @entity4 three years ago because he ‘ always delivered ’ but the goals dried up and his attitude was questioned			1
@entity1 said : ‘ everyone is even now			2
that ’s what you can do			0
it ’s publicly known what ’s happened and everyone is on a level playing field			0
the only uncertainty is the main one – how long does it take to get sold ? ’ he added : ‘ @entity85 is doing well , we had one of the physios over there last tuesday to see how he was			0
an injury like that is a nightmare for him , especially the @entity53 but he ’s doing ok			0
it ’s still too early to judge how far away he is			0
’ @entity95 job : @entity96 wants to follow in his father 's footsteps by moving to @entity99 meanwhile , @entity96 has spoken about his ‘ dream ’ opportunity to follow in father @entity101 ’s footsteps and join @entity99			0
@entity96 , who can leave @entity104 for a nominal fee , said : ‘ it is unbelievable to be mentioned with them … it really is dreams			0
‘ there are options there but i have n’t ruled out staying in @entity113			0
