by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 08:27 est , 7 december 2012 a @entity4 woman 's newborn son was mistakenly given to the wrong mother , who breastfed the infant before doctors discovered the mixup , it has emerged			1
both mothers and the baby had to undergo blood testing for hepatitis and @entity14 , diseases that can be transmitted through breastfeeding , after the incident at @entity18 in @entity19			1
@entity20 , the woman whose baby was given to a stranger , said she had left her son @entity23 in the nursery overnight as she attempted to get some rest - but wishes she never had			1
she awoke the next morning to find two people in her hospital room to tell her that @entity23 had been placed in the wrong bassinet in the nursery and given to another woman to breastfeed			1
' and she looked at the @entity41 band on his ankle and realised that she had the wrong child , that she had my son			1
' the woman immediately hit the nurse button and summoned her back to the room to take the baby away			2
@entity20 struggled to contain her tears as branded the mistake an ' oversight ' by the nurse , who had failed to compare the child 's identification wrist band against the mother 's			1
' my advice would be - and i 'm sure this is a rare occurrence and never happens - is do n't put your baby in the nursery because you do n't know what could happen , ' she said			2
mixup : the other mother noticed something was wrong when she started breastfeeding @entity23 horrifying : she checked the baby 's identification tag and discovered the boy was not her child ' you think you 're going to get your baby back and you might not			1
i 'm very lucky that i did get him back and everything was ok			0
' the hospital issued @entity77 a letter of apology and an admission of negligence , which stated that the babies were accidentally placed in the wrong bassinets in the hospital nursery			0
@entity86 places matching wristbands on every newborn and its mother to prevent mixups such as this one , according to hospital officials			0
' while hospital procedures require staff to match codes on the infant ’s and mother ’s identification bands in order to prevent incidents like this , it appears these procedures were not followed in this case , ' @entity86 hospital said in a statement			0
the hospital is investigating the matter to try and find out what went wrong and how the wrong baby was placed in a mother 's hands			1
' as far as we know , this has never happened before at @entity86 , ' @entity113 , a spokeswoman for the hospital , told the @entity39			0
' apparently , somebody did n't follow procedure , so that 's what we 're trying to figure out , ' she said			0
' and there will be consequences			0
' scene : the @entity19 hospital issued an apology and said the wrist bands had not been checked , as is policy @entity86 is n't the first hospital to mistakenly switch babies at birth			1
in march , a similar mistake occurred at @entity131 , where a newborn was brought to the wrong mother and , like at @entity86 , breastfed by the stranger before doctors discovered the mistake			2
the hospital installed a new digital baby - mother matching system following the mix - up to ensure that it would n't happen again			2
it 's unclear whether @entity86 is planning similar systematic changes to its baby - mother matching system			2
relief : @entity20 said she feels lucky that nothing worse happened to her son after the ' oversight ' ' on behalf of @entity18 , i am very sorry this incident occurred , ' said @entity150 , a practicing obstetrician and chief clinical officer of @entity152 , which owns @entity18			1
' providing the best possible patient experience and care quality is our foremost concern and this incident should not have occurred			0
' as an obstetrician , i have personally seen verification of the infant ’s identifying name band matched correctly with the mother ’s on hundreds of occasions			2
it is extremely unfortunate that was not the case this time			0
' we sincerely apologize to the involved families and will make certain we understand why our procedures were not appropriately followed in this case			0
' see below for video			0
