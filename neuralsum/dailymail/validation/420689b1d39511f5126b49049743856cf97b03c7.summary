it can take months of planning and its fair share of disagreements on the way to plan the perfect road trip			2
but now one @entity7 scientist believes he has planned the perfect @entity9 road trip that means we can all put away those atlases and close down @entity13 maps			2
@entity15 data scientist , @entity16 , has come up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance , excluding any journeys over water			1
covering 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving , mr @entity16 advises putting three months aside to explore the cities			0
rather than looking at every possible solution , @entity34 used something known as a ' genetic algorithms ' which starts with just a few random solutions			0
it then manipulates these solutions , while trying something slightly different each time , until it finds one that it ca n't improve on			0
@entity42 , @entity43 @entity44 , @entity45 @entity46 , @entity47 @entity48 , @entity49 @entity50 , @entity49 @entity51 , @entity49 @entity52 , @entity49 @entity53 @entity54 , @entity49 @entity55 , @entity56 @entity57 , @entity47 @entity58 , @entity58 , @entity59 @entity60 , @entity60 , @entity29 @entity61 , @entity62 @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 @entity66 , @entity67 @entity68 , @entity43 @entity69 , @entity70 @entity71 , @entity72 @entity73 , 74205 @entity74 , @entity30 @entity75 , @entity31 @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 @entity80 , @entity81 @entity82 , @entity83 @entity84 , @entity45 @entity85 , @entity86 @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity86 @entity90 , @entity27 @entity91 , @entity27 @entity92 , @entity93 cliffs of @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity93 @entity97 , @entity98 @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity27 @entity101 , @entity27 @entity102 , @entity103 @entity104 , @entity105 @entity106 , @entity107 @entity108 , @entity28 @entity109 , @entity107 @entity110 , @entity107 @entity111 , @entity107 @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity105 @entity114 , @entity105 @entity115 , @entity116 @entity117 , @entity118 @entity104 in @entity105 is obviously included in @entity34 's ultimate @entity9 road trip map , as he wanted to take in many famous landmarks @entity34 is the man behind the ' where 's @entity124 ' ( ' where 's @entity126 ' in the @entity27 ) algorithm where he looked at numerous pages of the famous children 's illustrative challenges , and developed a mapping theory on how best to locate all the bespectacled characters			1
using similar methodology , @entity34 then took on the challenge of planning the best @entity7 road trip - ensuring the car would never leave home soil on its route			1
his only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous @entity7 states , along with @entity142 and two stops in @entity144			0
there is a scheduled stop - off at the world famous prehistoric monument of @entity99 in @entity149 , @entity27 each stop would be at a national natural landmark , national historic site , national park or national monument			1
and the car could never leave @entity7 soil			0
to create the map , mr @entity16 first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided			1
the tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible			0
you will get the chance to stretch your legs and take in some cycling exercise with a stop - off in @entity85			2

@entity16 has come up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance for a special road trip
journey takes in 45 stop - offs in total , taking in countries such as the @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31
@entity182 had *earlier* devised the ultimate @entity7 road trip , and famous for the ' where 's @entity124 ' algorithm
