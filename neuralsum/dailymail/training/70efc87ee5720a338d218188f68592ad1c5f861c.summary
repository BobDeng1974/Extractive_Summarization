a daring mother - of - two put herself up for sale on @entity2 in a quest to meet her dream @entity6 man - but quickly took it down after receiving bids from as far away as @entity9			1
@entity10 , 49 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , posted the unique advert on sunday night in the hope a ' rugged , gorgeous , @entity6 guy ' would snap her up			1
but the serial @entity2 user , who has always dreamed of moving to @entity17 , started getting cold feet after notching up a £ 205 bid in less than 24 hours			1
so my friend @entity32 , who lives over there , said “ put yourself on @entity2 and i will share the link all over @entity17 ”			1
' he has loads of friends so we just thought we would see what happened and see whether anyone was interested , just for a bit of fun			2
‘ it was up for one whole evening and one morning too			2
in that time , i had one bid from @entity9 and one from @entity28 - i was amazed when it got to over £ 200			1
‘ but , no - one from @entity17 ended up contacting me - which was kind of the point			2
' the tongue - in - cheek advert , entitled ' female size 10 ' , described ms @entity10 as being in ' pretty good condition ' with ' good bodywork and a sense of fun '			1
the advert added : ' cooks and cleans , no warranty ... fuses have been known to blow '			2
ms @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , posted the advert on sunday night but had taken it around 12 hours later despite removing the post , ms @entity10 is still being contacted by men over email , including from the @entity29 she also posted accompanying photos , including images of her most recent visit to @entity67			1
she added : ' it was really a bit tongue - in - cheek to see what would happen			2
kind of like online dating i suppose - but i thought i might as well have a bit of fun with it			2
' i was hoping for a nice @entity6 , rugged , gorgeous guy – the sort all women want			1
a few dates – that sort of thing			0
of course , i was collection only and there were no refunds after purchase			0
‘ we were going to leave it and let the advert run , and just see who came forward			0
but i just changed my mind			0
‘ it got to the point where i thought “ i have only got two bids ” and i had agreed on 20 per cent charges			0
so i worried i was going to be charged more than i was worth ! ' in the tongue - in - cheek advert , entitled ' female size 10 ' , ms @entity10 described how she was in ' pretty good condition ' with ' good bodywork and a sense of fun ' but the swift removal of the post has not stopped ms @entity10 being inundated with offers from men around the globe			1
she said : ‘ since i ’ve taken it down , i ’ve had about six or seven people email me , asking if they can still bid			1
i do n’t even know how they managed to get in touch			0
one was from @entity29 and said he had his credit card number ready and could he make a bid			1
‘ there ’s another guy that ’s constantly emailing me – i do n’t know where he ’s even from			0
‘ i might do the advert again and this time ask specifically for someone from @entity17 – it ’s tempting			0
’ ms @entity10 has wanted to move to @entity17 since she first visited the country five years ago			1
while travelling there on her own , she stayed in accommodation run by @entity124 's @entity123 , where she befriended the owners			0
she and the family struck up an unlikely friendship and she now travels to their home near @entity130 , @entity131 , to visit them as often as she can			0
ms @entity10 has even started learning @entity6 , which she tries to practice when talking to the family over @entity134			1
it was one of the sons in the family , @entity137 , who suggested she post the advert			0
she said : ' i ’ve wanted to live over there for ages			0
they are like my second family , really			0
but i have n’t gone yet because of the economy mainly			0
