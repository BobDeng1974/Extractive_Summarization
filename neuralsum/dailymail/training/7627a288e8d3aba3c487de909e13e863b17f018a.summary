by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:10 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:14 est , 20 december 2013 the @entity4 tradition brings joy to millions of children , but for one seven - year - old boy with autism it has helped open up a new world of possibilities			1
@entity12 's mother , @entity11 , told @entity13 that she bought him a toy elf last year and quickly noticed how the daily game of hide - and - seek fostered his communication and imagination			1
the 38 - year - old @entity19 - based writer and founder of the blog site @entity22 continued : ' he liked it , especially after we read the story to him			1
he liked that " @entity27 " was in a different place every day			2
' close bond : @entity29 bought her autistic son @entity30 a toy elf last year and quickly noticed how the daily game of hide - and - seek fostered his communication and imagination @entity30 's behavior also improved as he ' believed that @entity35 was watching him ' and if he stepped out of line @entity36 would know			1
yesterday , ms @entity12 said she forgot to hide the red - clothed character and was surprised by her son 's quick - witted reaction			1
' when i forgot to move the toy @entity30 noticed and moved it			1
then he asked me to look for @entity35			0
i think he liked the idea of us switching roles			0
' ' seeing @entity30 excited about @entity35 makes the few seconds of finding a new spot makes it worth it ' while she acknowledges that @entity4 is a nightmare for most parents , she says she 's ' all for ' anything that gets her son ' talking and engaging '			1
@entity30 was diagnosed with autism when he was two - and - a - half years old , at the time he had no speech or ' imaginative play skills '			1
ms @entity12 said she had suspected long before that something was ' wrong			0
' in one of her regular blogs for @entity64 she recalls : ' @entity30 was about 16 months old [ and ] i remember asking my husband - [ but ] he dismissed my concerns			2
the holiday ritual enjoyed by families around the world was inspired by 2005 best - selling children 's picture book @entity4 : a @entity72 ' experienced mom friends told me i was just being a " new mom			1
" my mother told me i was reading too many books			2
and my pediatrician suggested we wait and see			0
' so that ’s what i did			0
i listened to everyone else instead of going with my gut instinct			0
i knew as soon as i took @entity30 in for that fist evaluation			0
i knew when i started flipping through @entity30 ’s milestone calendar			0
' it brings a little of the holiday magic to us , rather than having to seek it out			2
it ’s @entity91 fun in the comfort of our home ' ' i was n’t too busy to fill it out , he had n’t met most of the milestones of a typically developing child			0
i knew - before the doctor even diagnosed him - that @entity30 had autism			1
' occupational therapy has helped him to develop communication and social skills and he currently attends a special education school for children with autism			1
ms @entity12 says at home , playing video games and building with @entity112 blocks have also proved effective in reducing symptoms			0
returning to the subject of @entity4 , she concludes on @entity64 : ' i ’ve read so many negative things about [ the ritual ] : it ’ a waste of time , it ’s creepy			1
' to me it ’s just fun			0
[ it 's ] our holiday thing			0
it brings a little of the holiday magic to us , rather than having to seek it out			2
it ’s @entity91 fun in the comfort of our home			0
' seeing @entity30 excited about @entity35 makes the few seconds of finding a new spot makes it worth it			2
