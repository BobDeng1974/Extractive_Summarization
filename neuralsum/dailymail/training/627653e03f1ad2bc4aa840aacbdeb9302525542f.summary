according to state records , he donated $ 1000 to @entity130 and organisation set up to ' defend ' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from ' gay rights activists ' and ' radical judges ' seeking to ' redefine marriage '			0
he also made a donation of $ 350 to senator @entity139 a conservative opponent of the state 's same - sex marriage ballot			0
similarly vocal in his defense of family values is attorney @entity145 , identified by @entity146 as one of the men charged with ' engaging a prostitute ' , and a @entity151 based lawyer			1
mr @entity91 , 49 , served on the @entity152 from 2008 until summer 2012			0
in his professional biography he makes great play of his commitment to the community and to his family who are , he says , ' firmly settled in @entity151 '			0
he goes on : ' i can honestly say that of all the wonderful places i 've had the chance to live in , @entity151 , me is exactly where i want to be			0
' i 'm heavily invested in the community i served on the @entity164 from 2000 - 2005			0
i also served on the @entity152 from 2008 until summer , 2012			0
' he has coached and umpired for the local little league and volunteered in local schools			0
when approached by @entity168 mr @entity91 declined to comment			0
speaking to @entity151 's @entity169 , @entity170 , a sociologist at @entity172 and expert on prostitution said that the fact that a large number of @entity14 's alleged clients were in such related or similar businesses , ' does suggest that there was some referring going on '			1
@entity14 is said to have kept meticulous notes , a ' @entity181 ' and stands accused of having filmed clients in her @entity4 studio and rented office former mayor , @entity187 , 58 , a married father of four with ' lots of explaining to do ' to his wife attorney @entity190 , 54 , a ' happy guy who loves his wife and children ' financier @entity193 , 63 , who lives in a $ 500,000 waterfront @entity16 home @entity196 , 57 , a realtor with a string of wealthy clients in search for real estate and timberland @entity14 kept meticulous records suggesting a business enterprise that brought in more than $ 150,000 in 18 months and including a ' @entity181 , ' and client list reportedly running to 150 ' johns			1
' this , along with other materials removed from her @entity4 studio has formed the basis for much of the @entity146 investigation			1
an honours student who raised money for good causes , none suspected @entity14 of living a double life speaking to @entity168 last month lieutenant @entity217 admitted that they were a long way from completing their inquiries			2
he said : ' we 've been investigating since september 2011 and we 're nowhere near finished			0
' we have to establish probably cause before we can charge these men and we 're working through a long list			2
' the investigation was sparked by a tip off from a ' concerned resident ' who had grown suspicious of the frequent male visitors to @entity14 's dance studio and , later , a rented office across the street			1
but nobody could possibly have imagined the torrent of allegation and counter-allegation that would follow			0
to most of those who knew her to that point @entity14 was simply ' a fun and energetic ' girl , a former honours student from neighbouring @entity242 who took part in charity drives and class trips with her 7 - year - old son			2
she hosted @entity4 charity events for earthquake victims in @entity249 , the @entity251 foundation for breast cancer and @entity253			2
these are the sort of our - of - hours activities residents of the light - house studded coastline expect of their neighbours			0
but if the charges against are prove true she did all this while leading a double life that included acts of prostitution and filming clients			0
so far police have released three batches of names of men charged with engaging a prostitute			1
as well as the peculiar prevalence of contractors , painters , drywall and concrete specialists , window and flooring professionals , realtors , appraisers and real estate attorneys the list has included former mayor @entity284 , 58 , realtor @entity196 , 57 , attorney @entity190 , 54 , financier @entity193 , 63 and local ice hockey coach , @entity285 who has since stepped down from his role at @entity287			2
all of the accused men sought to prevent their names being made a matter of public record in an application that was last month denied in @entity293 by justice @entity294			2
picture perfect : @entity15 had long been known simply for its white beaches , light - house studded coastline , lobster and proximity to the @entity303 family 's summer home they are not the only men seeking to distance themselves from @entity306 , the @entity4 instrutcor who allegedly employed a number of online aliases to advertise her willingness to ' have fun ( @entity312 ) with both men and women '			1
the lawyer acting for @entity71 , 57 , @entity14 's former business partner and alleged co-conspirator , has applied to have @entity71 's case heard separately from the dance instructor			1
according to @entity71 's lawyer , @entity320 , this is because @entity14 faces far more serious felony charges than @entity71 who has been charged with 59 misdemeanours - all of which he denies			1
she has been charged on 106 counts of prositution , invasion of privacy , conspiracy , tax offences and receving welfare benefits when ineligible for welfare			0
mr @entity320 said , ' it is guilt by association and we woudl just as soon go this month on our own , by ourselves			0
' mr @entity320 is also hoping that his client 's trial can be heard before @entity338 - an impossiblity for @entity14 as the police continue to issue summonses , and release names , pushing the trial well into next year			1

three men who work in construction *industry* appeared in court yesterday
four others pleaded guilty before their names were released by police
others opted for jury trial or had their attorney file plea deals for them to avoid appearing in court
