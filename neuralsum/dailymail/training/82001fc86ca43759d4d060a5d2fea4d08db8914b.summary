@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7 ... 1			2
@entity9 ’s hopes of being used as a central striker are being damaged by the sensational scoring form of @entity12			1
when @entity9 signed his new £ 100,000 a week contract a year ago it was on the promise of playing in his favourite role – he ’d just made his case by getting five goals in as many games after being moved from the wings			1
@entity9 sees his best chance brilliantly saved by @entity23 keeper @entity22 @entity9 had come off the bench to replace @entity25 , but has not completed 90 minutes this season fast forward and @entity9 has yet to play 90 minutes since recovering from injury , while @entity12 has seven goals from his last nine games and @entity25 is also competing for the same position			1
it did n’t help @entity9 ’s case that his one big opportunity to get on the score sheet against @entity23 saw him denied by a brilliant @entity22 save			1
the @entity37 star wants to play as a central striker , but will need to start scoring more goals 2			2
@entity40 blamed @entity42 ’s miserable showing at @entity43 on fatigue after his squad had played three games in six days			0
nine of the @entity42 starting line - up for the 4 - 0 drubbing at @entity49 had been involved in all of the fixtures , including making a trip to @entity53 that according to @entity54 is 120 miles away			0
you ’d have some sympathy with him – except ten of the side that @entity59 picked had also been involved in three games in six days			0
mind you their away game , at @entity62 , was only 119 miles away			0
under - fire @entity40 blamed heavy legs for @entity42 's cup exit , but @entity43 had played just as much 3			2
@entity66 has had his critics at both @entity68 and @entity69 for passing square or backwards – but working for @entity70 might just help him rediscover the spark that got him into the @entity37 squad back when sir @entity73 was his gaffer			1
@entity66 has played just 29 per cent of passes forward this season , but should improve under @entity70 in 22 appearances for @entity69 this season the 25 - year - old had hit barely 29 per cent of 880 passes forwards			1
but after new boss @entity70 went into the dressing room at half time against @entity81 to give his first talk , @entity66 was transformed			1
in all he hit 28 out of 42 passes forward in the 2 - 1 @entity5 win – a total of 66 per cent			1
maybe it was the poor pitch , maybe it was the way @entity87 ’s @entity86 snapped into tackles , but @entity90 ’s performance at @entity91 was abysmal			1
most @entity93 players achieve passing accuracy figures of at least 80 per cent in most games , with many registering scores in the 90s			1
@entity99 's 19.3 per cent pass completion was the best @entity90 can manage in a shocking showing but not one of @entity103 ’s team that became the @entity106 side ’s latest victims found a team mate with more than @entity99 ’s meagre 59.3 per cent of passes			1
midfielders @entity109 and @entity110 both gave it away 16 times out of the 32 attempts to pass the ball			0
@entity115 has recovered from the mini confidence crisis that saw him taken out of the firing line by @entity119 boss @entity118			1
@entity115 , who has conceded just four goals in nine games , comes to punch against @entity122 @entity124 ’s early goal for @entity122 was only the fourth the 26 - year - old @entity125 has conceded in his last nine games – and the faith that @entity118 now has in him is shown by the fact he ’s getting picked for @entity5 ties as well as @entity93 games			1
@entity115 made three good saves to protect @entity119 ’s 2 - 1 win , and also made half a dozen catches			1
things are not going so well , though , for @entity135 who faces the rest of the season sat on the bench behind @entity139 at @entity140			0
the 21 - year - old who was a surprise late call - up for @entity146 ’s @entity145 squad had been told by boss @entity147 he would play in @entity5 games and should use them to challenge for the number one @entity93 spot			0
@entity135 conceded four times against @entity153 , and may now have limited opportunities this season but the 4 - 1 defeat to @entity153 leaves @entity135 , who spent the first part of the season out on loan at @entity159 to get game time , facing the fact he ’ll get few more opportunities this season			0
@entity170 ’s return to @entity119 after half a season polishing up his act under @entity168 ’s guidance at @entity159 has given an opportunity to another bright young star to step up			1
@entity168 has filled the place in his promotion chasing squad by taking @entity68 ’s equally precocious @entity175 on loan			0
the 22 - year - old , just recovered from the knee injury he suffered making his @entity68 debut against @entity180 in august , was the pick of @entity159 ’s players in their 2 - 1 defeat by @entity184			2
@entity186 owner @entity185 might be considering reforming his “ managerial search committee ” as his club ’s miserable season takes another turn for the worse			0
@entity185 tasked a five - man committee that included former players @entity192 , @entity194 and @entity195 to head hunt a replacement for @entity198 when the @entity199 was sacked in september			2
@entity200 made a great start with @entity186 , but their form has begun to slip in recent weeks in the event they never needed to deliver their report as @entity200 won five games out of seven to land the job			2
since then the 43 - year - old former @entity208 chief has not found life so simple – the 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity211 made it just two wins from his last 13 games			0
nearly 15 years since the infamous @entity216 match when he was chased by @entity217 and a possee of @entity68 players , referee @entity220 ’ @entity214 is still causing controversy			2
the 51 - year - old steadfastly refused to hang up his whistle despite getting relegated from the elite list in 2005			0
@entity226 boss @entity225 slammed him for failing to give a penalty and a red card when @entity229 appeared to be pulled back by @entity230 as the @entity231 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity233			0
@entity235 teenager @entity234 has made a dramatic difference to @entity237 since joining @entity240 ’s @entity239 team on loan			0
the @entity242 had gone seven games without a win before the 19 - year - old was recalled from a loan spell with @entity247 and then sent to sign at @entity248			0
the 2 - 0 win over @entity250 made it three wins in a row without conceding a goal , and pushed @entity240 ’s team back into the @entity239 play - off places .			0

at @entity258 's form is keeping @entity9 out of his preferred position
@entity66 should start moving forward under @entity70
no @entity90 players managed more the *60* per cent passing accuracy
@entity115 's return to form is *encouraging* for @entity119
