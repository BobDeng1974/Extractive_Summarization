by @entity0 cooking for guests is always a nerve - racking experience , so spare a thought for the schoolboy who was handed the task of whipping up ice cream fit for a royal countess			0
luckily for the junior chef in question , the royal was @entity11 and the cone was made using easy - to - handle paper instead of sugar and cream			0
and it certainly seemed to go down well with the @entity17 , who beamed as she accepted the cone during a tour of the @entity21 and @entity20 while on a visit to the @entity23			1
can i eat this ? @entity11 looks ready to tuck in but unfortunately for the @entity17 , this treat is made of paper @entity17 , whose last appearance was an emotional visit to the @entity31 hospital where she gave birth to both of her children , looked on fine form as she was shown around the school and crouched down to get a closer look at the projects on display			0
ever the style maven , the @entity17 was chic in a cream pencil skirt which she teamed with a tailored black jacket that showed off her svelte figure			0

after accepting a posy packed with seasonal hyacinths from a six - year - old pupil , the @entity17 was whisked off to visit ethical fashion label @entity83 at their headquarters in nearby @entity86			2
there she met the company 's two new apprentices as well as founders @entity90 and @entity91 , who gave her a tour of the premises			0
