benefit of beauty : good - looking guests at famous @entity11 eatery @entity26 atop @entity28 are said to be automatically upgraded to the best tables in the house guests at @entity31 , a restaurant at the top of @entity11 ’ @entity28 with stunning panoramic views of the @entity4 capital , and @entity36 , near the @entity37 , are given tables following a strict appearance policy – the better looking they are , the better the table			1
‘ the good - looking ones are led to the good places , where they can be easily seen , ’ they two former staff members told @entity4 weekly @entity43			0
‘ as for the non-good - looking ones , it is imperative that they be dispatched to the corners of the room			0
’ if the staff seats a less aesthetically pleasing guest at a good table , they are told off along the lines of : ‘ what are these ugly mugs doing at this table ? everyone can see them when they come in			0
it ’s very bad for our image , ’ @entity51 reports			0
face of the place : the rules applying to @entity68 by the @entity37 ensures that ' beautiful guests ' as well as ' model physique ' front - of - house staff are seen by passers - by , while ' ugly ' diners are placed in the back the @entity12 group are run by brothers @entity76 and @entity77 and include several other restaurants and cafes in @entity11 , as well as hotels and cinemas			1

good - looking diners at @entity31 and @entity36 get better tables
owners would tell staff ' where to seat ugly people , former hostesses claim
*ex-employees* of restaurant group claim *similar* rules apply for staff
*prospective* hostesses need to be over 5ft7in and have ' model physique '
