the two - year - old dog , found near a @entity12 play park , had been beaten , burned , starved and stabbed in the eyes in what was described as ' medieval ' torture			1
animal rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull , including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue , as the worst they had ever seen			2
cruel : this two - year - old pit bull was found with horrific injuries abused : @entity23 weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed , burned and tortured ' it is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving other animals or perhaps vulnerable people , ' district attorney @entity24 said			1
the dog 's injuries were so severe that she had to be euthanized			2
when she was found in @entity37 on august 31 she weighed only 18lb			2
a healthy weight for the breed and age is 40lb			0
when she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car , but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light , @entity42 25 reported			0
vet @entity49 - @entity48 was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog 's body			0
' her joints were pulled apart like medieval times , ' she told the @entity58			1
' she was beaten , stabbed , burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life			2
' the vet added : ' when i saw how vulnerable she was and i understood immediately the duration of her suffering , my heart collapsed			0
' @entity65 natured : despite having broken bones , crushed vertebrae and other injuries , the pit bull was friendly torture : the dog 's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart although there was no evidence of sexual interference , which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases , the dog 's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly			1
despite the pain and suffering @entity81 had clearly experienced in her short life , staff at the rescue center said she was sweet natured			1
' within hours of being found she had pain medication , food and love			0
she experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life , ' dr @entity48 said , adding that the dog 's injuries were so severe she would have always been in pain if she had n't been put down			0
as well as the burn and stab marks , the dog 's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board			0
in pain : the dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep horrified : @entity109 says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered ' words can not adequately describe the shocking suffering that @entity23 endured or capture the urgency in identifying who did this to her , ' @entity113 , president of the @entity115 shelter that took her in , said police are asking anyone who recognizes the dog or has any information on who its owner may be to get in touch			0
@entity37 residents , moved by @entity81 's plight , have also been offering rewards for information leading to an arrest .			1

' @entity81 ' had been stabbed in the eye and had limbs pulled apart
