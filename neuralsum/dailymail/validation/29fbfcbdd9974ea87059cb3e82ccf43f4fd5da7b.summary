new figures show childhood obesity rates double while children are at primary school , with one in five leaving primary school obese one in 10 children are obese when they start primary school at the age of four , shocking new figures have revealed			1
and in the space of five years , childhood obesity rates double , with one in five children leaving primary school obese			1
experts today warned that not enough is being done in schools to tackle the childhood obesity epidemic , urging the government to increase compulsory physical activity levels			1
the new figures , published today by the @entity16 , show 9.5 per cent of reception class children , aged four to five , were obese in 2013 - 14			1
it marks a slight rise from 9.3 per cent the previous year , but is lower than in 2006 - 07 , when 9.9 per cent of the age group were obese			2
in year 6 , the proportion of 10 to 11 - year - olds who were obese was 19.1 per cent in 2013 - 14 , up from 18.9 per cent the previous year , and also a rise from 17.5 per cent in 2006 - 07			1
@entity24 , spokesman for the @entity25 , said while the ' adult population seems to be getting the message ' , with rates remaining largely constant in men and women , childhood obesity is the ' real concern '			0
he told @entity33 : ' the huge doubling between children aged four and 11 is particularly disastrous			1
' mr @entity24 warned by the time children reach 11 it is ' recognised they have more or less made up their minds about their lifestyle '			1
' those 11 - year - olds are probably going to end up as obese adults , ' he said			1
' it means every year there will be more and more obese adults adding to these statistics			1
' he said in @entity47 the @entity48 has been forced to re-evaluate its obesity forecast figures , predicting that 50 per cent of the nation will be obese by 2030 - 20 years earlier than previously estimated			1
' we used to think we 'd be retired and buried by 2050 , ' he said			0
' but 2030 is a whole generation earlier			0
' while acknowledging the forecast is currently only specific to @entity47 , mr @entity24 said it is a concerning trend			2
mr @entity24 , who is also chair of the @entity57 , told @entity33 the blame for spiralling primary school obesity rates , in part , lies with a failed education programme			1
he said the current scheme , introduced by @entity62 and pursued by the @entity63 , ' is n't working '			0
' one of the reasons for these high rates of obesity by the time a child is 11 is a lack of physical education , ' mr @entity24 told @entity33			2
' children are just not getting enough exercise			2
' he rejected the tendency of politicians to lay blame solely at the door of parents , noting the period where child obesity rates rise is when they are in primary school - and so spending the majority of their time away from home			1
and he warned an added concern is not knowing how children are spending their pocket money at corner shops and on their way home			1
experts say the exercise programme in schools ' is n't working ' and today called for the government to introduce more @entity95 lessons into the curriculum ( file picture posed by models ) ' if only schools were to have proper physical activity , these numbers would reduce significantly ' mr @entity24 said			1
' there must be an absolute requirement to bring physical education back into mainstream school activity			0
' @entity107 responsibility is always the quick response from @entity63			0
' but in fact once a child goes to school they are outside parental responsibility for a great amount of the day			0
the @entity95 and @entity115 , conducted in 2009 - 10 , found 55 per cent of pupils in years one to 13 participated in at least three hours of high - quality @entity95 and out - of - hours school sport each week			1
sixty - four per cent of pupils in primary schools reached that level of exercise each week			0
the guidelines , introduced in 2011 , state children aged five to 18 should be at least moderately active for at least an hour every day			0
sixty minutes is , however , just a minimum and children and young people should in fact be active for several hours each day			0
for the first time in 2011 , the chief medical officers in the @entity130 published guidelines for children under the age of five			1
those able to walk unaided should be active for at least three hours a day , spread throughout the day			0
source : @entity16 ' schools should take over that responsibility both in terms of teaching the child , and their wellbeing and welfare , but that is plainly not happening			0
' the government has really got to up the focus on physical activity for children at school and in pre-school			2
' but action to tackle childhood obesity rates can not stop there , mr @entity24 argued			0
he said in light of statistics revealed at the weekend , that show hundreds of babies born each year are classified as obese , the focus must also be on informing women of the dangers of being overweight or obese at conception			2
' making sure females of child bearing age understand their responsibilities to the next generation is vital			0
' if a woman is overweight or obese at conception , it is most likely her baby will be obese from the moment it is born			0
' he added : ' there is a huge amount of work to be done			0
' today 's figures do reveal childhood obesity has fallen from its peak of 19 per cent in 2004 and 2005			2
the @entity16 said the latest data is ' not statistically significantly different from those over the last three or four years '			0
@entity178 , national lead for children , young people and families at @entity183 , said : ' overall childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010 , however for children from the poorest households levels have continued to worsen so there is no room for complacency			0
' we know that almost one in 10 four to five year olds are obese ( 9.5 per cent ) and by age 10 - 11 this doubles to nearly one in five ( 19.1 per cent )			2
' obese children are more likely to experience bullying , low self - esteem , anxiety , depression and have a higher risk of becoming obese adults and developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease as a result			1

by the time children leave primary school 20 **%** of children are obese
experts warned of ' disastrous ' trend , calling for more @entity95 lessons
said obese children are ' more likely ' to become obese adults
