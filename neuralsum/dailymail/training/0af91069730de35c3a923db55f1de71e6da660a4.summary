' he wrote : ' yes , our @entity35 leader @entity34 and our @entity38 leader @entity37 have recently found a liking for each other ’s attentions			0
and who can blame them ! ' following their regular nights together at scouts and all their camping adventures they 've decided to take their love into the digital age with a series of texts showing their involvement			0
' over the past eight months they 've shared numerous flirtatious texts			0
' mr @entity11 went on to claim that the text messages began last summer , adding that mr @entity19 's wife had also been unaware they were writing to one another			1
