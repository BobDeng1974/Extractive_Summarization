the apples in the ‘ weather - blemished ’ line originate from @entity0 - backed farms in @entity39 where unseasonal weather has left up to 70 per cent of crops damaged			0
@entity0 apple buyer @entity42 said : ‘ we are lucky that our customers are savvy enough who understand the unpredictability of farming and to trust that the fruit will be just as delicious , even if the apples do n’t look as perfect as usual			0
’ an estimated fifteen million tons of food valued at £ 19billion is thrown away across the @entity14 in total every year strict @entity52 rules on misshapen fruit and vegetables were relaxed in 2009 following years of criticism			1
