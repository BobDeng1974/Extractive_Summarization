@entity0 has denied knowing anything about her brother 's controversial choice to reveal he pretended to be an @entity4 to get into medical school			1
a representative for the comedienne told @entity8 she has been estranged from @entity9 ' for years ' and claimed she ' was not aware of his decision to apply to medical school under a different name and race			1
' this comes as @entity9 , 38 , admitted his sister has told him she is ' ashamed ' of him for opening up about his alleged experience ahead of the release of his new book , almost @entity18 , in which he will describe how he gained admission to medical school in 1998 by transforming his appearance			1
denial : @entity0 has said she was not aware her brother pretended to be black when he applied to medical school in the late 1990s ' my sister @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , of the @entity25 and is everyone hanging out without me ? , strongly disapproves of my book , ' he wrote			1
' she actually said , ' this book will bring shame on our family '			0
the rest of my family does not agree with the book			0
still , they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career , ' he added			0
@entity9 - @entity9 says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the @entity42 and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the @entity44			1
' i was determined to become a doctor and i knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were , let 's say â€¦ less stringent ? ' wrote @entity9			1
' i got into medical school because i said i was black			1
the funny thing is i 'm not			0
' he claims in 1998 he shaved his head , trimmed his ' long @entity55 eyelashes ' and joined the @entity56 during the process			2
controversial claims : on his website , @entity59 , @entity9 shows side - by - side qualifications and pictures of himself as an @entity55 - @entity44 man ( left ) and a black man ( right )			1
he does n't specify if he went through the same application process as an @entity55 - @entity44 man as he did as a black man his change in appearance was ' so startling that my own fraternity brothers did n't recognize me '			1
' @entity9 the @entity55 - @entity44 frat boy became @entity73 the @entity75 applicant to medical school , ' he said , claiming that @entity73 was the middle name he was born with			1
as an @entity55 - @entity44 with a gpa of 3.1 , @entity79 of 31 and a member of the @entity81 , he did n't think he 'd get into medical school , but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization , he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation			1
' i became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in @entity44 , including @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 , ' he said about the application process			2
' in all , i interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across @entity44 , while posing a black man , ' he added			1
despite his startling claims , @entity9 fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an @entity55 - @entity44 man			1
he also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person			0
when he was finally accepted to @entity42 , he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was ' wrong ' with affirmative action			1
indeed , @entity9 admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor			0
@entity9 - @entity9 also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating			2
success : @entity0 ( pictured left in august 2014 in @entity117 and right in april 2014 in @entity118 ) is the star of her own sitcom @entity25 ' not everything worked out as planned , ' he wrote on his website			2
store clerks accused me of shoplifting			0
women were either scared of me or could n't keep their hands off me			0
what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment			2
' and unsurprisingly , @entity9 has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims			0
the @entity138 claims that though his experience ' revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism ' , @entity9 did n't bring everything he could to the table			0
' he chooses to sidestep , downplay , or flat - out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations , ' @entity144 wrote			2
' it 's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who ' gets it ' , while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary , ' he added			1
and though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man , he does n't specify if he went through the application process as an @entity44 - @entity55 man			1
' @entity9 seems to have assumed that he would 've gotten nowhere as an @entity55 @entity44 applicant and dove head first into this poorly - conceived ' experiment ' before determining otherwise , ' @entity144 wrote			2
and more so , @entity144 claims that @entity9 's experiment ' is insulting to what black people endure in this country , both institutionally and culturally '			2
@entity144 claims : ' and as a person of color , it 's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies			0
' black people ca n't be as ' racist ' as whites societally , mr. @entity9			0
you did n't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black - owned and operated hospitals			0
' and a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work			0
' the attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false ' equality ' is truly regrettable			0
but when you conduct social ' experiments ' that cite @entity203 @entity202 's @entity201 as an inspiration , it 's obvious that you do n't take these issues all that seriously			0
