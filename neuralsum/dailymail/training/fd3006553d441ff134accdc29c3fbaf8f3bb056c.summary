by @entity0 the nuclear accident at @entity3 in @entity4 last year was a ' man - made disaster ' and not completely caused by the devastating tsunami , a new report has said			1
the @entity4 parliamentary panel today submitted its final report on the catastrophe			1
the probe is the third of its kind in @entity4 since the world 's worst nuclear crisis in a generation			1
in a damning report , the @entity17 's @entity16 said : ' the @entity24 accident was the result of collusion between the government , the regulators and @entity20 , and the lack of governance by said parties			2
' damning : the nuclear accident at @entity3 last year was a ' man - made disaster ' and not completely because of the tsunami , a report said earlier this month reactor meltdown : the damning indictment was delivered by the @entity4 parliamentary panel disaster : smoke is pictured ascending from the @entity40 nuclear plant 's @entity38 in @entity41 in @entity42 on march 14 last year ' they effectively betrayed the nation 's right to be safe from nuclear accidents			1
therefore , we conclude that the accident was clearly ' man - made '			0
' we believe that the root causes were the organisational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions , rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual			0
' the nuclear disaster followed a 9.0 magnitute earthquake off the coast of @entity4 in march last year - the most powerful ever known to hit the country			1
it led to a massive tsunami which devastated many towns and villages and led to almost 20,000 deaths			0
normal : the @entity3 plant is pictured before the disaster in 2008 damaged : this picture 8 days after the explosion shows the crippled plant			2
the operator of the plant @entity20 ( @entity20 ) was criticised in today 's report an earlier report by plant operator @entity20 ( @entity20 ) had all but cleared the huge utility , saying the size of the earthquake and tsunami was beyond all expectations and could not reasonably have been foreseen			1
but an independent group of scholars and journalists , who reported their findings in february , said @entity20 could and should have done more			0
it also said that had the company had its way , its staff would have been evacuated from the crippled plant and the catastrophe could have spiralled even further out of control			0
the findings published on thursday call for further investigation into the impact of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake - as opposed to the towering tsunami - on the reactors at @entity3			1
wrecked : waves swallow a seaside village on march 11 after an earthquake leads to a massive tsunami in @entity4			2
an explosion at @entity3 occured the following day horrific : local residents walk among destroyed houses and debris in the tsunami - damaged city of @entity109 , in @entity111 prefecture ' as for direct cause of the accident , the commission reached the conclusion that we can not definitely say any devices that were important for safety were not damaged by the earthquake , ' it said			2
' we can not rule out the possibility that a small - scale @entity122 ( loss - of - coolant accident ) occurred at the reactor no. 1 in particular			0
' although many scientists and activists have questioned the dominant narrative that cooling systems were knocked out by the rising waters , the government and @entity20 have been unwilling to say the reactors could have been damaged by the initial earthquake			2
tectonically - volatile @entity4 has a network of nuclear reactors that , until @entity3 , had supplied around a third of the nation 's electricity			1
2011 march 11 - a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hits @entity4 leading to a massive tsunami march 12 - explosion and radiation leak confirmed in reactor 1 at @entity3 march 14 - blast destroys concrete building in reactor 3 @entity145 reported in reactor 2 and fuel rods exposed for a while march 20 - @entity149 says plant will be decommissioned once crisis is over march 23 - the @entity4 chief cabinet secretary also advises that high levels of radioactivity have been found in @entity156 's drinking water april 2 - it is discovered for the first time that contaminated water is flowing into the sea april 3 - the first deaths at the plant are confirmed - two workers missing since march 11 are found dead wrecked : smoke is seen coming from the area of the no. 3 reactor of the power plant april 22 - @entity4 prime minister @entity168 states additional towns might be asked to evacuate may 5 - workers enter the reactor 1 building			1
this is the first time since the start of the crisis that a reactor building in the plant is visited by a human being june 3 - the first case is confirmed where radiation levels in humans have exceeded safe limits since the accident at the plant october 31 - a @entity187 study revealed that the @entity3 nuclear disaster caused the biggest discharge of radioactive material into the ocean in history december 15 - a long - range timetable is announced for the decommissioning of the @entity3 reactors			1
the decommissioning work will be completed by 2052 2012 april 5 - highly radioactive wastewater is accidentally discharged into the sea july 5 - the nuclear accident at @entity3 in @entity4 last year was a ' man - made disaster ' and not completely because of the tsunami , a new report claims the nuclear industry has long boasted of its many safeguards against earthquakes , but much recent public opposition to atomic power has focused on plants ' vulnerability , especially those that sit near seismic faults			1
in may this year it was revealed that fuel bills in @entity214 will rise this winter because of the devastating earthquake in @entity4			2
supplies of liquefied natural gas are being diverted east after the tsunami shut its nuclear power reactors			0
it could push the wholesale price of gas up by as much as 28 per cent , energy market analysts claimed			0
in march , it emerged one of the crippled nuclear reactors still has fatally high radiation levels and much less water to cool it than officials had thought			0
the news renewed doubts about the plant 's stability and provoked fears the other two reactors that had meltdowns could be in even worse shape			0
in december last year a long - range timetable was announced for the decommissioning of the @entity3 reactors			0
the work will be completed by 2052 .			0
