in an interview on @entity40 , mr @entity0 was asked if was ' leaving the door open tonight to changing the tax thresholds that mean people in that 40 per cent bracket could be paying more tax under you '			2

' but i have to be honest with people			0
the deficit is going to be £ 90 billion			0
i have got to find a way to get the deficit down in a careful , and staged and balanced way			0
' he said he would not be ' raising the higher rate of income tax ' but left open the possibility of holding or lowering the point at which it kicks in			1
' what i can not do is go through every detail of the tax system			0
' i am not going to make unfunded commitment to do so , because i fear in the end that will be a vat rise from the @entity15			2
you wo n't get that from me			0
' pressed on whether he plans to change the income tax bands , mr @entity0 said : ' i ca n't go through every detail			1

' chancellor @entity83 , visiting the @entity84 in @entity85 with @entity86 today			2
claimed mr @entity0 had ' let the cat out of the bag the number of people paying 40p tax has already risen by about two million to five million in two decades chancellor @entity83 said : ' @entity0 has let the cat out of the bag and confirmed a tax assault on middle earners			1
he has confirmed that he and @entity96 will put up taxes on middle @entity98			0
it is part of @entity29 's £ 3,000 tax rise for working families			2
' by contrast , the @entity103 plan is to increase to £ 50,000 the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of tax			1
so there is a clear choice			0
