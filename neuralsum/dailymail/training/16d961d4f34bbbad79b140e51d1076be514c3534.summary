so close to a morale - boosting victory in tricky circumstances , @entity1 ’s defence crumbled again to let their lead slip against @entity6 and raise fresh questions			1
individual errors from @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11 allowed the @entity13 champions two goals but collectively there were issues too			1
@entity17 and @entity18 struggled at times to get their communication sorted allowing the nimble @entity6 attackers opportunities to outmanoeuvre them			1
@entity23 was also flat - footed for the late equaliser			2
the @entity1 players look dejected after conceding a late equaliser against @entity6 on wednesday @entity1 's shaky defence has now conceded 13 goals from set pieces this season @entity30 needs to find a solution to his defensive problems , but does he have the personnel ? leadership is lacking across the backline and it tells a story that a £ 20million defender in @entity38 is left on the bench for such a big game			1
in 19 games this season , @entity1 have conceded 29 goals already – but more worryingly , 13 from set pieces			2
so how does each player rate ? @entity9 @entity46 believes the @entity48 goalkeeper needs taking out of the side , such are his troubles			1
@entity9 made a terrible error for @entity6 ' first goal in @entity13 , allowing @entity53 to score @entity9 has faced calls to be dropped after a series of mistakes have cost @entity1 points he was awful in @entity58 , shaky on crosses and failing to gather a routine shot to concede the opening goal			1
there are doubts he is up to the task at all and there are too many instances where he could do better			0
@entity23 he has lost his place in the @entity69 team due to uninspiring form but has featured 10 times for @entity1 this term			2
@entity23 was generally solid on wednesday , but his poor form has seen him lose his @entity69 place against @entity6 he operated at left back and was generally sound but failed to provide an offensive thrust			1
he did not to react quick enough at the corner which brought the late leveller			0
@entity38 where has the form gone that saw him star for @entity81 ? maybe @entity82 deserves more recognition			1
@entity38 ( second left ) was left on the bench against @entity6 after his shaky start to the season the former @entity81 defender has looked poor value for money after his £ 20million transfer this summer nothing like a £ 20m defender , @entity38 has played 17 games but rarely looked assured			1
too often a diver into tackles , when standing off would pay dividends			0
@entity17 another with 17 games under his belt this season , it has become increasingly clear his style is edging over the line of legality too frequently			0
@entity17 dives into a tackle - the defender has already picked up six bookings this season penalised against @entity110 for grabbing hold of shirts , that is a tactic that ultimately will harm more than it helps			2
he has been booked six times already			0
@entity10 emerged with credit from the reserve side sent out at the @entity117 at the start of november but @entity119 was his first match in a month and just his fifth of the season			0
despite a good performance against @entity124 last month , @entity10 has been used sparingly a poor clearance allowed the first goal , sleepy marking the second			2
it was his man who scored			0
@entity130 just five games this season for the @entity134 centre half who cost £ 18million last summer and none since late september due to a thigh injury			0
given he only played 19 times last campaign the jury is still out			0
there does seem a good defender in there , but supporters at @entity145 are yet to see him			0
@entity130 is back in training but has n't played for @entity1 since september due to a thigh injury @entity18 at 20 , he may need time to adjust to the @entity69 game having come from @entity150			1
he only played nine senior games for the @entity153 club before moving to @entity1			1
@entity18 has already played more games for @entity1 than he did in his time at @entity156 he already has 14 matches under @entity30			1
in @entity58 , he never seemed sure who to pick up as @entity6 interchanged positions			2
@entity11 looked a proper player when driving down the left wing at @entity162 and dispatching an arrow into the bottom corner for his first @entity1 goal			1
erred against @entity167 early in the season and , after coming on in @entity13 , allowed his man to get a flick on at the corner that found an equaliser			0
after a promising start with an excellent goal against @entity176 , @entity11 has looked out of his depth @entity178 just four games for the full back this season , after losing his place to @entity183 last campaign , and was part of the defence that got ripped apart by @entity187 in october			1
his last appearance due to a knee injury			0
@entity178 , who has not played since the scrappy win over @entity187 , has only four appearances this season amid a defence that is causing the @entity1 manager untold headaches , he can at least draw one positive			2
at least none of them are doing anything to attract the attentions of @entity199 or the like			0
@entity200 frustrated after late equaliser			0

@entity1 drew 2 - 2 against @entity6 on wednesday night
@entity38 has been poor since £ 20million move from @entity81
@entity9 made another error in draw against @entity6
@entity9 *criticised* by likes of @entity46 and @entity210
@entity153 full - backs @entity18 and @entity11 yet to adapt
