@entity0 used his first interview since january 's ' @entity3 ' scandal to claim that the scandal would make him a better leader and then gave the strongest hint to date he is to run for president in 2016			1
speaking to @entity11 anchor @entity10 at his home in @entity13 , the @entity9 governor also insisted that he ' did nothing to create the environment ' that caused his then - top aides to close lanes in the @entity18 as political payback on the mayor of @entity21 , @entity9			1
the embattled governor said that he was ' relieved ' to have been exonerated of any involvement by an inquiry , but rejected the suggestion that the law firm who conducted it was appointed by his office to ' whitewash ' its findings to protect him			1
scroll down for @entity33 : first interview : @entity0 spoke for the first time on thursday about the @entity3 scandal which engulfed his governorship in september asked if the hugely embarrassing political scandal had scuttled his chances of a 2016 presidential run , @entity0 said that in fact he believed it ' would make him a better leader '			1
the governor , who is known for his confrontational and honest leadership style , said that in his opinion voters still have a lot of respect for him - especially in @entity48 , where the first @entity50 presidential primary will be held in 2016			1
' i think they love me in @entity48 too , ' @entity0 said in the interview , which aired on @entity54 with @entity10 tonight			1
' i ’ve been there a lot			0
i think love me there too , especially because of the way i am			0
' ' not in spite of , especially because , ' @entity0 added			2
incredulous : @entity11 's @entity10 asked @entity0 if his personal brash style of leadership created a culture whereby his aides assumed that political payback was justified @entity0 spoke with @entity10 at his home in @entity13 , @entity9 @entity0 said that he has n't made a decision yet about a 2016 run and wo n't until next year			1
however , he said that the scandal involving his former aides , @entity71 , who infamously sent an email saying ' time for some traffic problems in @entity21 ' to @entity74 wo n't adversely affect any bid			1
' i do n’t intend to make a discussion about 2016 until a year from now , ' @entity0 said			2
' but it wo n’t have anything to do with what has happened in the past 10 weeks			2
' ' what has happened in last 10 weeks , i think will ultimately make me a better leader , whether it ’s governor of @entity9 or any other job i might take in the public or private sector , ' he said			1
adding to what appeared to be an admission he is giving 2016 serious consideration , @entity0 said his wife , @entity91 will not stand in his way			2
' our place right now is in @entity9 and as far as the future … i think the future will take care of itself , ' she said			2
' i certainly do n’t think this precludes a future that may lead that way			0
' @entity101 @entity102 under examination : @entity71 , the @entity0 aide who sent the infamous ' time for some traffic problems in @entity21 ' email , was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal close : @entity109 ( left ) was @entity0 's campaign manager until april when he stepped down and @entity71 took over @entity0 admitted that the scandal led him on a personal journey of ' soul searching ' and that he ' spent a lot of time in the last 11 weeks thinking about what did i do , if anything , to contribute to this , ' @entity0 said			1
the brash governor refuted any suggestions that his own personal style of management led to a culture where staff felt able to act on their own to close the busiest bridge in the world			1
' i do n’t think anyone would take that as an indication to do something so incredibly stupid , ' he said			0
at another point , he said to @entity10 : ' you asked if i contributed to a climate , and i do n’t believe that i did			2
' he pleaded ignorance and said that he was baffled by @entity71 and @entity74 's collusion in closing the bridge			1
' it defies credulity to me			0
which is why when things were first reported , i said , ' this ca n't possibly be true			0
' because who would do something like that ? sometimes , people do inexplicably stupid things , ' he said			2
@entity0 added , ' i ca n't get into what their motivations were , except to say that anybody who really knows me would not believe that doing something inexplicably stupid would please me			1
' the governor 's former deputy chief of staff , @entity71 and @entity74 who was appointed by @entity0 to the agency that runs the @entity18 have both been implicated in the scandal			1
@entity0 's government funded lawyer claims the @entity9 governor had nothing to do with the @entity18 scandal @entity0 has also sacked former campaign manager @entity109 , and @entity74 ’s boss at the @entity163 , @entity162 , who were both criticized for lying in the report released today which exonerates @entity0			1
indeed the report that cleared @entity0 also revealed that @entity71 and @entity109 were involved leading up to last year 's traffic @entity168 report , released today by a law firm @entity0 hired to investigate the scandal , said that the two had been a couple for months but had called things off a month before the @entity18 lane closures			1
blame game : @entity74 , who personally oversaw the @entity18 lane closures , says he has evidence that @entity0 lied - this was refuted by thursday report asked by @entity10 if he thought his aides were acting out of personal loyalty because @entity21 mayor , @entity182 did not endorse him , @entity0 said no. ' i do n’t believe it was for me , ' he said			1
indeed the report released today quashed speculation that the bridge was shut to affect @entity182			1
in fact the motive was identified as some unexplained ' ulterior motive ' fueled by the ' animosity ' towards the @entity21 mayor			0
the report also made it clear that @entity74 informed @entity0 that the bridge closure had caused huge traffic problems while the governor was at a 9/11 event in @entity199			1
however , @entity10 said that contradicts how @entity0 said that he learned of the closure			2
' i do n't have any recollection of that , ' @entity0 replied			2
' @entity74 was one of hundreds of people that i spoke to that day			2
we stood around and spoke briefly that day			0
' i do n't have any recollection of him saying anything			0
but i 'll tell you this			0
i 'll tell you what he did n't say			0
' he did n't say , ‘ hey , by the way governor , i 'm closing down some lanes of the @entity18 to stick it to the mayor			2
is that ok ? ’ that i 'd remember			0
' in his view : governor @entity0 's office hired @entity223 , a former federal prosecutor , to investigate the scandal and the report released thursday declares clears @entity0 of wrongdoing the lawyer hired by @entity9 gov. @entity0 to review a traffic - blocking scandal that has engulfed @entity0 's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot @entity0 deemed the past two months the worst of his professional life and said that the episode had brought him closer to his family			1
' right after it happened , our oldest son was home on break , and he asked me , ' did you do this ? ’ the governor said			0
' it was a tough question that your son would ask you			0
and i said , ‘ no , i did n’t			0
’ and he said , ‘ good , i ’m glad			0
’ ' it ’s brought me closer to my family , it ’s brought me to re-evaluate some of the way i spend my time , ' @entity0 said			2
all but two lanes of the @entity21 approach to the @entity18 were closed for four days in september - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters ' i think you can get caught up in this world and in this life so easily … i ’m spending a lot more time at home than i ever have … where it ’s taken me is that my responsibilities here are important too			1
' when asked if @entity71 was potentially a smoking gun who could reveal the governor did know , @entity0 said that she could n't ' credibly ' do that			1
he wrapped up the interview by claiming that at no point was he ever close to resigning			0
' i ’m not a quitter , ' he said			0
' you do n’t do that			0
certainly , from my perspective , position , i knew i had n’t done anything wrong , so there is no reason for me to leave			0
in fact there is even more of a reason for me to stay , to fix it			0
that ’s who i am — someone who has to fix things			0
so , for me it was even more of an incentive not to go			0
