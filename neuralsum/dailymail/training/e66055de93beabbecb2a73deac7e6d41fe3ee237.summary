it 's every parent 's worst nightmare - when @entity4 and @entity5 waved their daughter off on a gap year adventure , the thought she would never return home was inconceivable			1
but the parents from @entity10 , @entity11 , were bereft after @entity12 , 19 , was killed while she was volunteering in @entity13			1
the teenager had been enjoying teaching at a school in @entity17 where she ran a homework club for orphans			0
she intended to stay there for a year before taking up a place at @entity22			0
@entity5 and @entity4 today , the couple have made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of children in @entity27 after setting up a charity in memory of their late daughter life cut short : @entity12 had been enjoying a gap year in @entity13 before taking a place at @entity22 but her life was cut short when a pick - up truck she had been travelling in crashed after its tyre burst due to striking a pothole			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and their three other daughters , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 were devastated			1
in search of closure , @entity4 and @entity5 felt compelled to visit the area where @entity12 had spent her final days			1
@entity4 , 68 , said : ' it was very hard going to visit @entity13			1
everywhere we went there were reminders of @entity12			0
' the places we were going to were all places that @entity12 had been			0
i even saw a woman in the market who was wearing one of @entity12 's dresses because after @entity12 passed away her clothes were distributed within the community			0
' loss : from left @entity5 , @entity42 , @entity12 , @entity43 , @entity44 and mother @entity4 before @entity12 's gap year in her memory : @entity4 , left , was determined to help the orphans her daughter , right , had worked with after she visited the school where @entity12 had volunteered the trip ended up being more than just a chance to feel closer to their daughter after @entity4 , who used to work as a language teacher , and @entity5 , 70 , a former @entity72 ambassador , met the orphans @entity12 had worked with			1
@entity4 realised that they too had felt loss and she knew she had to do something to help them - which would also allow her to honour @entity12 's memory			1
she recalled : ' when we got there all the children that @entity12 had been teaching met us and sang a welcoming @entity27 song , which was incredibly moving			1
there were hundreds of them			0
i realised that we had lost one child and all these children had lost parents			2
and that coming from a privileged society we were in a position to do something to help them			0
' there is never any reason or meaning you can bring to a young death but being able to continue the work that @entity12 started has been so important to us			0
not only has it helped the children in @entity13 it has helped me and @entity12 â€™s sisters to be able to do something in her name			2
in some way it keeps her alive			0
' moved by their plight : @entity4 and @entity5 with the children in @entity13 they vowed to help , pictured during their visit in 1997 following the death of their daughter since setting up the charity in 1998 , @entity5 , pictured with children in @entity13 , and @entity4 have helped thousands money donated to @entity117 , which is now supported by @entity118 , helps students like these who would not otherwise get a good education in @entity13 these female students have been given access to education thanks to fundraising in @entity12 's memory there are 1.2 million orphaned children living in @entity13 , almost half have lost at least one parent to hiv / aids			1
without parental support , many go without a good education			0
but thanks to donations this @entity136 ... the parents set up @entity117 which supports thousands of six to eighteen - year - olds who have lost one or both of their parents to @entity142 , enabling them to access primary and secondary education in the @entity145 region of @entity13			1
since starting the charity in 1998 , the year after @entity12 's death , they have raised thousands of pounds that has made a difference to the lives of thousands of children			2
their supporters have run marathons , scaled mountains and walked for miles in order to secure sponsorship			0
@entity4 , who has taken on fundraising challenges herself along with her family , said : ' in the 16 years since our beloved @entity12 died her fund has paid over 82,000 primary school fees and 38,000 secondary school fees			2
' on average we have been supporting about 8,000 children in school each year			0
by enabling them to go to school @entity117 has given them a ladder to climb up out of the destitution to which they would otherwise have been condemned			0
that is something very special			0
' now the charity has joined forces with @entity118 - which launched its latest appeal on monday ahead of @entity136 on friday 13th march			1
with help from @entity118 , the charity 's main priority is to increase the attendance of orphaned children - and in particular girls - in schools and to ensure they receive a full course of primary education			1
a common obstacle for children in @entity13 is the inability to afford essential school kit such as uniforms and textbooks			2
@entity117 pays for these crucial items so children can then access education			1
@entity136 is back on friday 13th march			2
@entity193 raised this @entity136 will help to transform lives here in the @entity72 and across @entity27			2
