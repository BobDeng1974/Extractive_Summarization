by @entity1 reporter published : 22:51 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 04:10 est , 16 december 2013 the families of a young pregnant @entity4 woman murdered in @entity5 and her missing boyfriend fear that he too may have been killed			1
@entity8 , 22 , is a suspect in the murder of his girlfriend @entity10 , 25 , but he has not been seen since before @entity10 's body was discovered strangled and dumped in the ocean on the coast off @entity5 's @entity5			1
' we 're definitely concerned that he was also murdered alongside @entity10			2
it 's very possible her body showed up and his did n't , ' @entity8 's sister @entity18 said			2
what happened ? @entity10 , 25 , was murdered in @entity5 in may and her boyfriend , @entity20 , 22 , vanished and was suspected of killing her			1
but her family is not convinced he was responsible ' it just seems all too easy to blame someone who is n't even here , may not even be alive to defend himself			0
' @entity10 's body was found in may this year and there has been no sign of @entity8 in the seven months since			1
neither family knows what to believe and are finding it difficult to grieve without knowing what happened to @entity10 and @entity20			1
@entity30 was newly pregnant when she was strangled with rope , dragged across rocks and thrown into the ocean off @entity34 , @entity5			1
police initially suspected her missing boyfriend @entity8 , but family members have insisted he had no money to escape or motive to kill her			1
months later , a local news site received a cryptic note suggesting @entity8 , known to his friends and family as ' @entity20 ' , had also been killed amid racial tensions			1
now the @entity10 and @entity8 families have been left with little to go on and no further to finding out exactly what happened to their loved ones			1
' whoever killed her does not deserve to be walking around , ' @entity10 's mother @entity50 told @entity52 in a new interview			2
' but i feel like i ca n't really grieve right now because of the not knowing			0
it 's always going to be there			0
' @entity50 was initially worried about how trusting her ' free spirited ' daughter could be but knew it was right for @entity10 when she decided to go traveling to the @entity5 in january			1
there , she met @entity8 and just months later they returned to the family home in @entity64 , @entity4 to break the news : they were expecting a baby			2
they also announced their plans for the future ; @entity10 said she would work as a yoga instructor while @entity20 wanted give lava tours			1
missed : @entity10 's mother @entity50 , pictured with her left and as a baby , said she can not grieve until she knows what happened to her daughter , who was strangled , and who was responsible tragedy : @entity10 was newly pregnant and looking forward to starting a yoga business when she was killed ' she seemed finally ready to settle down , ' @entity10 said			1
but less than three weeks later , @entity20 failed to turn up to a meeting with a real estate agent and @entity10 did n't call her mother to wish her a happy birthday			2
days later , on may 28 , a fisherman found her body in waters off the island			0
unanswered questions : @entity10 's family became concerned when she failed to call her mother on her birthday , and her partner missed an appointment with a real estate agent police believe @entity8 , the only suspect in the case , may have stayed in a local hostel two weeks after @entity10 's death using a pseudonym			1
according to @entity102 , the manager of the hostel said she recognized his face from pictures but said he checked - in as @entity105			0
but @entity20 's sister @entity106 told the magazine : ' he 's not capable of this			0
he has a good heart			0
we were taught right from wrong			0
' then to further complicate the case , a news site received the anonymous letter claiming that @entity20 had also been killed following racial tensions			1
the note listed specifics about the alleged murder			0
bizzare : signs have started appearing around the town saying that @entity20 was murdered on the lava fields the writer explains that @entity20 had intended to buy land at @entity125 and conduct lava tours without paying locals a cut of $ 1,000 a week			2
' haole had to be killed befor ( sic ) he buy land ... said this message 2 haole , stay out of @entity133 is for the pono , ' the note said			0
in @entity5 , ' haole ' is a term used for @entity137 and ' pono ' is a @entity140 word for righteousness			0
posters also began to emerge around the town , reading : ' you killed the baby ! they killed @entity20 on the lava flow ! confess ! ' ahead of his disappearance , @entity20 was supposed to meet with a realtor and was going to sign a deal to purchase 10 acres of land - but he never showed up			2
scene : her body was found off the coast of @entity34 , @entity5 near to where the couple had been camping now his family does n't know what to think			2
' if he is n't the murderer , that means he 's dead , ' his sister said			0
' so what do we have to look forward to			0
i keep praying that the police get their job done and they find this killer			0
' both of the families have said that the police have failed to keep them updated with the case , and for now , all they can do is wonder what happened to their loved ones and who is responsible .			0
