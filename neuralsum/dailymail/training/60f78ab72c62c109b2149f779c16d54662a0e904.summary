there were over 150 entries to the @entity13 @entity15 's annual photographic competition , some of which focused on recognisable structures such as pylons and cars , while others studied objects in microscopic detail			1
the completion aims to show that engineering is not only about fixing machines and building bridges , but involves everything from nanomaterials and biology to building towering structures			1
diffraction sun : mr @entity32 shone a laser light onto a small liquid crystal device , causing the light to interfere with itself and become diffracted			1
his sun - like image is the result of this diffraction			1
the research behind this image could potentially help create a microscope that would allow people to see very fast and very small objects , such as a virus infecting a cell @entity46 and @entity47 were the joint winners of the second prize with their electron microscopy image of the reflective coating and fibrous cloth of a man - made fabric			1
their photograph was taken as part of a research project focusing on the life - cycle of these fabrics and their research could help decrease the environmental impact of the fibre - dyeing process a @entity65 micrograph of a heart - shaped boron nitride fragment grown on iron foil			2
due to its atomic thickness and insulating nature , hexagonal boron nitride is used as support material for graphene in transistors it had five categories this year - first , second and third prizes as well as a prize for a micrograph captured using an electron microscope and a @entity82 's prize for the photo or video with the most innovative engineering story behind it			1
entrants included students and professors who were told the their images must be ' beautiful , fascinating , intriguing , amusing or possibly all of these things			0
' the first prize went to researcher @entity32 for his entry called diffraction sun. this is a simulation of a chaotic dynamic system portrayed using software that forms these spectacular fractals , or mathematical sets			1
the colouring was added to the image to show the velocity and angles between consecutive points @entity106 's photograph called mirror image shows a 3d laser scanner that is being used to measure deformations in the @entity111 station at @entity112			1
the information collected will be fed into models for analysis in order to predict the behaviour of future complex tunnel geometries dr @entity119 is exploring porous magnetic materials to encourage cell and tissue in - growth into an implant surface and to improve the connection between bone and implant			0
in the image , human stem cells are growing into fibre networks			0
the actin cytoskeleton of the cells is stained green , while the nuclei are fluorescent blue			0
the image shows that the cells have attached between the fibres shown in grey the phd student shone a laser light onto a small liquid crystal device , causing the light to interfere with itself and become diffracted			1
@entity32 ’s sun - like image is the result of this diffraction			1
the research behind this image could potentially help create a microscope that would allow people to see very fast and very small objects , such as a virus infecting a cell , which at the moment can only be observed with great difficulty			1
@entity46 and @entity47 were the joint winners of the second prize with their electron microscopy image of the reflective coating and fibrous cloth of a man - made fabric			2
this image shows an emulsion of blue ink droplets in oil produced using a microfluidic device			1
the aim was to mix two fluids and produce nano - litre sized droplets of the mixed solution in oil			0
a chip with this function can be used or to study the movement of chemicals their photograph was taken as part of a research project focusing on the life - cycle of these fabrics and their research could help decrease the environmental impact of the fibre - dyeing process			2
@entity106 , who works in the @entity82 ’s @entity183 , won third prize for his image called mirror finish			1
his photograph shows a @entity189 laser scanner that is being used to measure deformations in the @entity111 station at @entity112			2
this image depicts a wing that is flat on the bottom and curved on top ( like the kind used on airplanes ) which is simultaneously rotating and travelling along rapidly over a short distance through water			0
the vortices are visualised by injecting a dye composed of milk and water			0
mr @entity204 ' work is targeted towards understanding the aerodynamics of small insects with an intended application for @entity208 the information collected will be fed into models for analysis in order to predict the behaviour of future complex tunnel geometries and will be a valuable tool in the future as new underground tunnels are built			0
' the winning images are diverse , beautiful and meaningful , ' said @entity219 , director of research at @entity220 , which supported the competition			2
' they all tell wonderful stories of engineering students , researchers and academics seeking to discover new scientific truths and advance technology			0
liquid crystalline molecules are fascinating compounds and conceal the whole colourful universe within them			0
they reveal these mesmerising textures under polarised microscope making calibration tests enjoyable : a sequence of photos that capture the full ballistic impact by firing a ball bearing at a spare piece of reconstituted marble ' the winners give an eye - catching glimpse of work in the @entity248 , but there were over 150 other entrants this year , each communicating their unique message of how engineering is advancing and helping the @entity254			2
the breadth and quality of work is quite staggering , ' he said			0
brajith @entity258 won a prize for his image of a bone cell branching across two steel fibres , which was photographed as part of a research project focusing on the effect that coating a hip implant with fibrin , a protein gel , has on the body ’s inflammation process			2
there were many other images entered into the competition , including @entity275 ’s chemical vapour deposition graphene samples that look like a starry sky at night , @entity278 ’s sequential frames charting a ballistic impact , and @entity281 ’s flower - shaped simulation of a chaotic attractor			0
the winning images can be viewed online from today via the @entity13 ’s website , along with other entries			1
electrospinning is a method of producing fibres with micrometer to nanometer - scale diameters			0
the fibres are especially interesting for tissue engineering applications , as the their sizes are similar to those of proteins and molecules found in cells			0
the electrospun fibres pictured are composed of @entity298 , a polymer that is commonly used in biomedical applications this image shows graphene grown on copper			0
the photo was taken using an optical microscope			0

there were over 150 entries to the @entity13 @entity15 's annual competition
it aims to show that engineering is not only about fixing machines and building bridges , but involves everything from nanomaterials and biology to building towering structures
the first prize went to research student @entity32 for his entry called diffraction sun , which shows a diffracted laser light shining onto a small liquid crystal device
