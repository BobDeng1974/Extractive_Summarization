by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 16:51 est , 18 september 2013 they may not be binging on broccoli , but some @entity4 students are at least pausing before they fill up on fried food , thanks to dishware designed to remind them about healthy options			1
two years after the federal government abandoned the food pyramid as a symbol for healthful eating and adopted an image of a plate instead , the university has gone a step further by printing dietary guidelines directly on plates used in campus dining halls			1
the so - called @entity21 , named after the school 's mascot , offer a bit more detail than the ' @entity28 ' graphic promoted by the @entity27 @entity26			1
a new plate at the @entity31 college spells out dietary guidelines willing students to choose healthy foods when mom and dad are n't around anymore to serve them while the @entity26 image shows a plate divided into four segments labeled ' fruits , ' '' vegetables , ' ' grains , ' and ' proteins , ' the wild cat plate specifies ' lean protein ' and ' whole grains ' and offers suggestions such as ' try whole wheat pasta , brown rice or quinoa			1
' like schools around the country , @entity4 has revamped its dining halls in recent years to add healthier - some would even say gourmet - offerings			2
first lady @entity58 's ' @entity57 ' campaign has collaborated on past initiatives with the @entity26 's ' @entity28 ' program			0
the university has set a goal of becoming the nation 's healthiest campus by 2020 and believes the new plates are a helpful tool for students who may be away from home and making their own food choices for the first time , said @entity71 , deputy director of the @entity31 @entity72			1
' they 're moving from a place where sometimes their dining experiences at home were kind of dictated by their parents , and now they have a lot of freedom , which is great in some ways , but this becomes one of the helpful reminders for how to eat well , ' she said			0
' some people will use them to get kind of a sense of what a healthy plate looks like , and then ingrain that in their everyday living and not need that plate every single time			0
' the plates , made of melamine , are mixed in with the university 's standard ceramic plates , with about 1,300 circulating through three dining halls that serve 12,000 meals per day			2
during one recent lunch hour , some students piled their plates with veggies , while others reached for grilled cheese , pasta and sausage			2
freshman @entity108 covered the fruit and vegetable portions of his plate with fried onion rings and the protein section with grilled chicken			1
there was a pile of chicken nuggets in the middle , and blobs of ketchup and mustard in the grain section			1
@entity4 hopes its students will avoid onion rings and french fries in favor of fruits , veggies and maybe some tofu ' it 's not a very nutritious lunch , but i 'm drinking water , ' he said			1
@entity108 , 19 , said he does try to eat healthily but said he pays no attention to the plates			2
sophomore @entity137 said while she does n't match her food to the plates , they 've made her more aware of portion sizes , and in general , she thinks the university is taking the right approach			0
' i think it makes sense , ' said @entity137 , who stays away from both sugar and dairy products			0
' people should eat healthy			0
' @entity149 , a junior , said the plates have prompted him to choose an apple instead of french fries on occasion , but they have not been a major influence on his diet			0
and his main reason for preferring the plates had more to do with how they emerge from the dishwasher than the healthy message			0
' i wish it was better than this , but i like them because they 're not searing hot like the ceramic plates , ' he said			0
' it does make a little ( health ) conscious , but not a ton			0
' @entity31 college prints colorful plates in hopes of teaching students how to eat properly and avoid food that will pack on the pounds dining hall manager @entity176 said he has seen some students taking the plates seriously , while others ignore them			1
it 's all part of the challenge of keeping up with students ' changing tastes while also promoting health , he said			2
' we 're always trying to infuse more healthy options as a choice , but we do n't impose it on people , ' he said			0
' that 's really our strategy : to have a balance			0
' a number of versions of the plates are available commercially , and they 're often used as teaching tools , said dr. @entity198 , acting executive director at the @entity26 's @entity200			2
he did not know of other schools that have been serving food on the plates like @entity4 but said many are using the image in banners and posters			1
and since the @entity26 launched its ' my plate on @entity211 ' initiative in the spring , he said , more than 800 students in all 50 states and nearly a dozen other countries have signed up to become ambassadors who encourage healthy eating at their schools			0
the @entity21 plates are manufactured by a @entity31 company			1
with @entity26 permission , @entity4 has copyrighted its modified design and hopes to license it to other high schools and colleges that could add their own logos to the plates and use them in their dining halls .			1

colorful ' @entity21 plate ' tells students how much vegetables , lean protein and whole grains to eat
however freshmen already seen covering the plates with fried onion rings , chicken nuggets and ketchup
