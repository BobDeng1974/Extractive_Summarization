by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is one of very few englishmen who knows what it ’s like to beat the @entity7 in @entity7			1
it has only happened twice : first in 1973 and again in june 2003 , when the side captained by @entity10 claimed a landmark 15 - 13 victory in @entity13 en route to @entity16 glory in @entity17 five months later			2
@entity2 attributes that victory to supreme self - belief , and is adamant that the class of 2014 have that in abundance			2
on the training pitch : former @entity23 international @entity2 is @entity24 's forwards coach the 43 - year - old was the tourists ’ starting loosehead prop on a night when the @entity23 pack stood firm in a series of scrums on their own line , despite having two men in the sin - bin			1
@entity2 , now @entity24 ’s forwards coach , has suggested that the success he was part of 11 years ago was founded on confidence and a refusal to succumb to the hosts ’ formidable reputation			1
‘ it ’s been referenced a lot , that victory , ’ he said in @entity40			2
‘ it was a special night and what it took was an incredible amount of self - belief			0
‘ we were lucky because @entity50 missed a few opportunities with ball in hand and shots at goal			0
but we stuck in there			0
we were down to six men in a scrum on our own goalline in one period because we had @entity61 ( @entity62 ) and @entity63 ( @entity64 ) in the sin - bin ... cheers ! ‘ it ’s hard enough with a full deck of cards against the @entity7 , never mind being down to six ! famous win : @entity23 players celebrate beating @entity7 15 - 13 in @entity13 in 2003 @entity72 ; @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , may ; @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 ; @entity81 , @entity82 ; @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 ( capt ) ‘ we were hanging on for dear life , but that ’s rugby — digging in when you ’re facing adversity			1
‘ that was a significant win for that group of players who went on to win the @entity16			0
it was a stepping stone and that ’s what this is for this group of young players			0
pitching yourself against the best at @entity102 — it does n’t get any better or harder than that			0
’ as @entity23 ’s reinforcements from the clubs in the @entity109 final left @entity110 on monday , the men already in @entity40 were continuing the countdown to saturday ’s daunting series opener against the world champions at a stadium where the @entity7 are defending a 20 - year unbeaten record			1
‘ it ’s there to be broken , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ our mind - set in 2003 was , “ let ’s get after them ” , and that ’s the same mind - set that we had at @entity122 in 2012 ( when @entity23 claimed a record 38 - 21 win )			2
airborne : @entity23 's @entity125 scores a try during the 38 - 21 win over the @entity7 at @entity122 in 2012 ' we talk about giving the opposition what they do n’t want , but we have to better @entity7 ’s physicality because , crikey , they bring enough physicality			1
it ’s about not showing them too much respect			0
’ @entity139 centre @entity137 was unable to train again on monday , meaning he is now certain to miss the @entity40 clash			1
that is likely to mean @entity142 of @entity143 is pitched into midfield duty at @entity145 alongside @entity74			0
sidelined : @entity137 ( left ) is out of the @entity40 match after missing training on monday			1

the @entity23 forwards coach was part of the side who beat @entity7 in @entity13 in 2003
@entity23 take on @entity7 in the opening @entity154 in @entity40 on saturday
@entity137 is out of saturday 's clash after he did not train on monday
