judge @entity0 , pictured , ruled @entity1 must pay a proportion of the legal costs the couple incurred during the 14 - month long legal battle the adoptive parents of a seriously - disabled child have won £ 14,000 in legal costs after a year - long battle with the local council over care for their son			1
the five - year - old , known only as ' k ' for legal reasons , was diagnosed with learning difficulties and severe mental health issues after being placed with the couple in 2011			1
a dispute broke out between the couple , referred to as @entity20 and @entity21 , and @entity1 over who should pay for the preparation of a care plan to meet the complex need of the young boy			1
judge @entity0 , sitting at @entity27 , ruled last month that @entity1 must pay a large proportion of the legal costs the couple incurred during the 14 - month long legal battle			1
lawyers for the couple warned that if other local authorities were to act like @entity1 , it will become ' impossible ' for ' hard to place children ' like child @entity36 to find homes with loving families			1
in the written judgement released today , judge @entity0 said that at the time @entity36 was placed with the couple , aged 22 months , ' the extent of his difficulties had not been understood '			1
it meant the couple found themselves ' parenting a child with an array of problems ' without any support as @entity1 had not identified the child 's difficulties - or the assistance they would require			1
despite these challenges , the judge said , the proposed adopters are ' devoted ' to the boy and he is ' very much part of their family '			0
they filed their application to adopt @entity36 in july 2013			0
by this point , the couple claim they had raised issues about the levels of support they needed for several months			1
this was done in light of the adoptive mother 's health deteriorating , said judge @entity0			2
local authority officials made it clear @entity1 would not pay for any assessment of @entity36 's complex needs - required to draw up a care plan - and expected them ' to sort out the issues with the social workers '			1
the court ordered the council to carry out an assessment and put together a proposed care plan but delays and missed deadlines meant an agreement was not reached until november 2014			1
during this time , the council also failed to address the particular needs of @entity36 until it received a report from children 's charity @entity93			0
a dispute broke out between the couple , referred to as @entity20 and @entity21 , and @entity1 ( headquarters pictured ) over who should pay for the preparation of a care plan to meet the complex need of the young boy judge @entity0 said the proposed adopters argued that , without expert legal advice and representation , they would not have achieved the support plan they now had and which is vital for @entity107 august 2011 - @entity36 , then aged 22 months , is placed with prospective adoptive parents			1
july 2013 - the couple filed to adopt. they claim that by this point they had been raising issues about the support the boy required for several months			1
8 november 2013 - @entity27 orders the council to produce a report and assessment , to include the extent of the child ’s complex needs and the services which are to be offered			2
prior to this , the @entity1 made it clear they expected the couple to ' sort out the issues with the social workers '			1
later that day , the @entity1 submitted a care plan , saying ' it was not a draft '			1
20 december 2013 - further order made about obtaining further medical records for @entity107 january 2014 - council misses deadline to produce report and assessment , including care services to be offered			2
february 2014 - council misses deadline to produce medical records			0
hearing was put off until june			0
mid-september 2014 - @entity141 for the couple chase the council for new report and support plan after it was not submitted in august			1
30 september 2014 - @entity141 wrote about the @entity145 meeting the proposed adopters costs , but this was not agreed			0
5 november 2014 - @entity145 filed yet another support plan			2
this support plan did not in fact say what the social worker had indicated it would say			2
14 november 2014 - another support plan emerged which was acceptable to the couple with a couple of minor amendments			1
18 november 2014 - they applied for an order that the @entity145 pay their costs			0
25 november 2014 - judge heard submissions in relation to the costs incurred by the prospective adopters in their adoption of @entity107 12 december 2014 - judge orders local authority to pay £ 14,000 in costs			1
today - written judgement released the county council argued it should not have to pay the couple 's costs bill and contended it had been ' generous ' to the family in terms of funding - particularly regarding the final support plan			1
the judge concluded that without the proposed adopters ' expert legal advice , ' either the placement would have broken down because the appropriate support was not in place , or the adoption would have gone ahead but without the support which all now agree is necessary , which would have meant @entity36 and his parents would continue to struggle			2
' the judge said there had been ' great delay ' , and it appeared the local authority was slow to recognise the extent of @entity36 's difficulties and the demands his care was making on @entity20 and @entity21 the couple sought just over £ 17,000 in legal fees , but the judge ruled they were entitled to £ 14,000			1
she said this reflected the fact that @entity20 and @entity21 had been successful in securing the right support plan necessary to make an adoption order possible			0
it also reflected fact that the county council ' were unreasonable and delayed and did not comply with orders of the court '			0
commenting on the ruling , @entity208 , representing the couple , said : ' many people must wonder - " why did it take so long ? " less committed couples would have thrown in the towel years ago			0
' mr @entity214 added : ' the government want more adoptions			0
they want to see hard to place children finding homes in loving families			0
' if other local authorities act like @entity1 it will be impossible for this key policy to succeed			0
why should adopters have to fight for support and risk their own money in this way ? ' there is no legal aid for contests over support plans			0
the costs in this case ran to five figures before @entity1 were told to pay			2
' the local authority knew that they would have to find a specialist foster placement or residential home for @entity36 if this placement failed			0
@entity1 attitude was inexplicable ' : @entity20 said the council 's approach was ' a disgrace ' and the local authority ' fought us all the way '			2
he added : ' @entity1 did n't understand how the pressure from @entity36 's behaviour was building and ( my wife ) became seriously ill. ' we realised we needed legal representation			1
an inadequate support plan was prepared			0
' we tried to negotiate changes to the plan			0
social services and the independent reviewing officer said that this was the final version			0
there could be no additional support			0
' we are delighted by the judge 's decision to make @entity1 pay towards our costs			2
' judge @entity0 said she had made the final adoption order on the day she considered the issue of costs			0
judge @entity0 , sitting at @entity27 ( pictured ) said the adopters argued that , without expert legal advice and representation , they would not have achieved the vital support plan they now had for @entity36			2

boy was placed with couple in august 2011 when he was 22 months old
he was later diagnosed with learning difficulties and mental health issues
@entity1 were slow to assess the support he needed
that left the adoptive parents raising ' challenging ' child without help
couple took council to court to force it to draw up an adequate care plan
they have now been awarded £ 14,000 legal costs for that action
