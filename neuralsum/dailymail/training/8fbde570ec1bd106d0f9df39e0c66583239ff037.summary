@entity1 students have built a working wooden rollercoaster for a rush week celebration			1
known as the @entity5 , the stunt has become a tradition among engineering students			1
freshmen are invited to ride the coaster strapped into a small buggy - with many braving it backwards			1
scroll down to see the coaster in action freshmen spent a week building the coaster , and over 400 people were able to ride it over a party weekend			1
' after a hiatus of a few years , the roller coaster was brought back and was bigger and better than ever , ' the students said			1
the coaster was designed by three mechanical engineering juniors - @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 - and built in the span of a week by the incoming freshmen , who were eventually allowed to ride it			1
riders are strapped into a racecar seat mounted on a trolley the ride was a huge success			2
' by the end , the total ride and reset time was under 3 minutes , ' said @entity24 , one of the engineers who built it			1
' in total i 'd estimate around 400 people were able to ride the roller coaster between sunday night and thursday afternoon , when we closed it down			2
' @entity24 also admitted he was the test pilot for the coaster			2
' once the plywood track had been laid down , we slowly rolled the cart along the track , so make sure it traveled smoothly , then we did an unmanned test run with an empty cart , followed by a test run with 150 lbs of sand in the cart			0
' then i got to go			0
this was my first time riding a roller coaster of any kind			2
' however , the team admit they had to scale back their design - which originally featured a loop			1
' unfortunately , we had to scrap the loop , ' they wrote in a blog post explaining the stunt			2
' one of the steps to getting the coaster approved by @entity1 and @entity70 was going through @entity1 's @entity71 ( @entity72 )			1
' basically , @entity72 said no @entity73			0
' the initial design for the coaster included a loop - but @entity1 's health and safety department banned it t g - forces riders would experience were also mapped out by the team before construction started			1
' you 'll see that , with the friction estimate used , g - forces actually go just barely negative at the top of the second hill , ' the team said			0
the team also admit the coaster did not last long			0
' one big unknown pre-building was how the plywood track would hold up to repeated use , said @entity24			0
' by the time we stopped doing rides , there were a couple small patches of plywood where the top ply had started falling apart			0
' if we did want to run the roller coaster for longer , however , it would have been easy to replace just the top layer of plywood where it was wearing out			0
' timber for the project was delivered on a monday , with freshmen beginning construction immediately			0
by tuesday , the frame had begun to take shape , and the first ride took place on friday			0
the school and city required they submit plans for their design to the @entity116 with a letter of recommendation from a certified engineering firm			2
@entity120 , vice president of the @entity122 - based firm @entity121 , said his company reviewed the drawings put together by @entity1 students building the roller coaster ' students themselves developed the sketches and calculations , and at @entity1 's request we reviewed the sketches and made some comments to them			1
we then submitted a letter to the city saying that the plans would conform to the @entity138 , ' he told @entity122 magazine			0
based on the information forwarded by the engineers , the city deemed it a safe structure for campus use , and gave students the green light to begin building and have some fun .			0

@entity152 rollercoaster is a tradition on the @entity154
coaster was designed the three engineering students for rush week
was built by incoming freshmen in a single week - and they got to ride it
@entity1 's health and safety department banned original design with a loop
