a transgender person who had a £ 10,000 sex change to become a woman , but now wants to become a man again , has criticised the @entity4 for not doing enough to make sure he wanted the initial surgery			1
@entity6 , 30 , was born a boy and seven years ago started surgery to become a woman called @entity10 , but in the last six months he has taken steps to return to being a man called @entity6			1
he now wants the @entity14 health service to fund the £ 14,000 reversal process because he claims they did n't complete a rigorous enough mental evaluation before allowing him to go through the initial process			1
he now wants the taxpayer to foot a further £ 14,000 bill to become a fully - functioning man again he said : ' it 's definitely not checked enough			1
' people will hate me for that , but you have to live two full years as a woman to prove to the @entity4 that you are ready and there is n't enough psychiatric evaluation			1
' in the real life experience - those two years , i think maybe you should have a year of intensive weekly therapy just to keep pushing you , to keep checking you , keeping tabs			1
' not just meetings every month or three months , or by letters or emails , but by intensive therapy			0
' after becoming a woman , @entity6 became tired of putting on make - up and wearing heels , and he now accepts that she should always have stayed a man			1
@entity6 said he had struggled with his identity while growing up in @entity46 , @entity47 , and as a child he would dress up in women 's clothes			1
in his twenties , he became a drag queen known as miss @entity53 , drawing on glamour model @entity56 's look for inspiration			0
an initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor , sending @entity6 into a spiral of depression , he said			1
but then the former drag queen , who copied @entity56 's style by wearing a blonde wig , mini skirts and stilettos , had a chance meeting with his idol in a nightclub in 2007			0
but now , seven years after surgery to become a woman , @entity6 wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill			1
@entity6 , who lives on welfare benefits , told a magazine last week that he finds dressing and acting as a girl ' exhausting ' and feels he has never been fully accepted as a real woman			1
@entity6 , now living in @entity88 , was shocked to find out how many more social restraints are placed on women than men and admits he longed to be as free as a man			1
appearing on this morning earlier today to defend his comments , he said : ' going from male to female , they are two completely different gender roles in society - i found i had to be different with men completely			1
@entity6 is now embracing life as a man again , after feeling the restrictions on acting feminine too stifling ' girls were still the same , but guys start opening doors for you and all of those great things , but then you do have to conform to society pressures as a girl			1
' so being male again , it 's quite freeing actually , just to be able to live			0
' he is now aiming to have a breast reduction on the @entity4 and an intensive course of medicine and hormones at a total cost of £ 14,000			1
he said : ' i still have a male anatomy but have had gender altering treatment			0
' it is an intensive course of hormones and testosterone blockers that gets you ready for surgery ( to become a woman )			1
' it makes testicles shrink to the size of garden peas and makes you dry up in time for surgery			0
' i 'm trying to reverse it but it 's going to be a battle because it has been almost ten years			0
@entity6 earlier today : ' i still have a penis but it does n't function in the same way , it can get a semi-erection but it has still got to build back up			1
' because now i want to be male , i want to be the best male i can be , just like with a female , so hopefully i have to see with doctors if we can get it fully functioning			0
' although @entity6 now wants to have a fully - functioning male body , he is adamant that he would still love to be a woman if it could be a foolproof transformation			1
he said : ' i have always longed to be a woman , but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and i feel like i am living a lie			1
' it is exhausting putting on make - up and wearing heels all the time			2
even then i do n't feel i look like a proper woman			0
' i suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too			0
@entity6 during his transition period , when he lived for two years as a woman before undergoing hormone treatment on the @entity4 ' i have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way i look naturally and accept that i was born a man physically			1
' @entity6 , who spoke on @entity170 's @entity169 earlier this year about @entity56 's encouragement , says he does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for his reversion			2
' now i have decided i want to live as @entity6 , i am desperate to have my @entity175 - cup boobs removed , ' he said			1
' i ca n't afford to have them done privately , so i am hoping to have the op on the @entity4			2
' i ca n't work at the moment because i am too upset after what i have been through			0
' i do n't feel bad about the @entity4 paying for the surgery as i do n't consider it a choice			1
matthew during his transitional period to become a woman			0
he claims he has always been an outgoing person ' i need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health			2
i am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care			0
' @entity6 , who changed his name by deed poll from @entity195 in 2008 after a £ 5,000 boob job in @entity197 partly funded by benefit money , says he gradually began having doubts about the sex change			1
he said : ' i thought the surgery would make me feel complete , but it did n't			0
' i knew deep down that , even though i had had surgery , i had still been born a man			2
' but i tried my best to block out my feelings			0
' @entity6 said living as a woman is exhausting			1
' no matter how much make - up i put on or how i dressed , i knew people would not know me as a real woman			2
' it was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl			0
@entity6 said he had always struggled with his identity while growing up in @entity46 , @entity47			2
as a child he would dress up in women 's clothes , and in his twenties he became a drag queen known as miss @entity53 ' i was fighting a losing battle			0
when people found out about my past , they treated me like a liar and a fake			0
i suffered from anxiety and depression			0
' he said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack			0
he said : ' i could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more			0
it was making me miserable			0
' i had to go back to living as @entity6			2
' @entity6 has already had testosterone injections to begin his transition to becoming a man again			1
he has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair			0
he added : ' if people criticise me for wanting treatment on the @entity4 , it does not bother me			2
' i know i need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that			0
' the @entity246 yesterday insisted the @entity4 should not be expected to pay out again			2
research director @entity247 said : ' the @entity4 must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations			2
' this whole saga has simply cost far too much			0
if the @entity253 is to be properly funded , this sort of waste must be cut out			0
' to watch the whole @entity169 interview , go to : @entity255 do you have a sex change story ? have you had a difference experience to @entity6 ? email us your story @entity260			2
