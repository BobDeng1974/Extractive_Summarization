smartwatches and bands promise a range of features but the latest has the potential to save your life			0
called @entity7 , the wearable monitors your heart rate while driving to determine how awake you are			1
if it detects a drop in heart rate , which suggests you 're dozing off , it sounds an alarm on a connected smartphone			1
if it detects a drop in heart rate , which suggests you 're dozing off , it sounds an alarm on a smartphone ( illustrated ) when a person falls to sleep their heart rate drops by up around 10 to 30 beats per minute on average			1
to detect the most subtle of these changes , @entity7 uses digital photoplethysmography ( @entity33 ) - an imaging test used to detect changes in blood flow at the microvascular level on the skin			1
last year , researchers from the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity39 unveiled the @entity44 system			0
it measures the driver ’s heart rate and breathing via a sensor system knitted into the seatbelt and seat cover			1
if the rates drop too much , a warning alarm goes off			2
designer @entity54 said : ‘ the variation in heart and respiratory rate are good indicators of the state of the driver as they are related to fatigue			2
' @entity44 can monitor those variables and warn the driver before the symptoms appear			0
’ the researchers said the system is innovative because it can cancel out the motion of the car and only pick up heart and respiratory rate thanks to the ‘ smart textile materials ’ embedded in the seat cover and seatbelt			2
it 's typically used to monitor blood flow in people with @entity79 's disease , for example , from their fingers and toes			1
the technology shines a green led onto the skin , and based on the variations in colour that are reflected back , the sensor can detect the heartbeat			0
it uses a traffic - light system to monitor the beats and will issue a cautionary warning if it begins to drop into the ' amber ' section			0
the loud alarm rings when the rate reaches the ' red ' zone '			2
its @entity100 designers said : ' the pulsed light sensor technology is the best on the market in terms of stability , reliability even in motion and in terms of energy consumption			0
' they added that the detection is on par with a chest band ' without the disadvantage of having to wear an uncomfortable strap '			0
the clip can be fitted to a wristband but will also attach to a person 's underwear			1
it will work as long as its in contact with the skin			0
the sensor is currently under development , so these claims have not been put to the test , and the firm has launched a campaign on @entity131 to fund the project			1
kits are available to pre-order for £ 70 and will retail for £ 100 if the campaign is successful			0

crashes caused by tired drivers are most likely to happen on long journeys on monotonous roads , such as motorways , according to research			0
young male drivers , lorry drivers , employees in company cars and shift workers have been found to be most at risk of falling asleep at the wheel			0
research shows tiredness among drivers accounts for 20 to 35 per cent of serious accidents and suggests there are more than 6,000 fatalities a year in @entity220 because of driver fatigue .			0
