by @entity0 @entity2 championship leader @entity1 felt sore enough at losing sunday 's @entity4 @entity3 without then having to face conspiracy theories suggesting he had done it deliberately			2
the @entity9 driver , who finished second after making a mistake at the first chicane while under pressure from winning team mate @entity13 , could scarcely believe anyone would suggest such a thing			1
' i 've heard about that , but what would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately ? , ' asked the @entity22 , who saw his lead cut to 22 points with six races remaining			0
winner : @entity13 gives the thumbs up as @entity1 looks on after giving up his lead at @entity29 wrong turn : @entity1 goes off the track after a mistake which saw him lose first place to @entity13 ' there is no possible reason			1
there is no reason why the team would ask me to change position , or something like that			0
' the only thing in people 's minds could be @entity46 , but @entity46 was a mistake which i 've apologised for , ' added the @entity22 , who hit the back of @entity13 's car on the second lap of the @entity52 @entity3 two weeks ago			1
@entity13 said after that race that @entity1 had ' done it on purpose ' but he was certainly not accusing him of any such intent in @entity4			1
@entity1 accepted blame for the @entity46 incident , which led to @entity13 's race retirement , and was handed an unspecified punishment from his angry team who reminded their drivers they could race each other but must not make contact on the track			1
if there were some wondering whether a restitution of points might form part of that penalty , an idea that was discussed and swiftly dismissed by some paddock pundits post-race , the driver and team ridiculed the very thought			0
braking point : @entity1 attempts to brake but is forced off the track under pressure from @entity13 mistake : @entity1 ran straight on at the chicane on lap 29 to hand the lead to @entity9 team - mate @entity13 ' it 's not something where i have to give back something			1
mistakes , errors happen , and that 's the way it is , ( i make ) an apology and on we go , ' said @entity1 , who braked late and continued straight on at the chicane			2
he then had to slow and @entity93 to get back on track			0
' it 's not like we now start shuffling and things like that , so there is no reason why i would do something like that on purpose , ' added @entity1			2
@entity9 motorsport head @entity104 found the idea even more mind - boggling after being asked by @entity108 pundit and former team owner @entity109			0
' i said to @entity109 that only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea , ' he said			0
' i think there was lots of pressure on @entity1 because @entity13 was so quick yesterday and you could see that today as well , ' he added , explaining also that @entity1 had to miss the chicane because the alternative was to damage the tyres			1
decisive moment : @entity1 denied that he had deliberately given up the lead to his teammate @entity123 : by the time the @entity22 had negotiated the bollards @entity13 had emerged into the lead theories : it was suggested that @entity1 gave the place up on purpose after the incident at @entity46 that would have entailed another pitstop and lost time			2
television images also showed @entity104 smiling apparently as @entity13 took the lead after @entity1 's error , providing more fuel for the conspiracy theorists , but he dismissed any suggestion the two things were linked			1
' whoever picks that up and tries to interpret anything in such a picture must be out of his mind , ' said the @entity143			0
' @entity145 , it 's not live			0
' it was n't synchronised with the picture			0
' @entity104 explained that he had smiled when his two drivers were closing up , with @entity13 chasing down @entity1 , out of a sense of ' here we go again ' and anticipation of sparks to come			2
the footage was then spliced into the live action later			0
@entity13 had started from pole position on sunday , with @entity1 second , but fell to fourth at the start after a problem with his car 's race start settings			1

@entity1 finished second after error on lap 29
@entity9 driver failed to turn into chicane at turn one
@entity13 had started on pole but had to fight back after poor start
