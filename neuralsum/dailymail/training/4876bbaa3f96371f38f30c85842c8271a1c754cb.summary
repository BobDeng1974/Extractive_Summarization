now the father of three has taken his offer off the table and said the money is ' staying in his pocket			1
' ' if @entity12 's said that this is what she chooses , then it 's all over , ' @entity9 said thursday an interview with @entity43			1
' i ca n't say i am happy with her choice , ' he said			2
' if this is her choice then it 's for her			2
' @entity48 said he will not be accepting his daughter 's partner into his family			1
' i have no intention of mixing my life with her life , ' @entity9 said			1
' but if this is what she wants , then i respect her choice			2
' definitely not single : @entity59 , right , and her partner @entity18 , have been together for nine years and married in @entity61 in 2012 in denial : @entity3 billionaire mr @entity9 , who claims to have slept with 10,000 women , still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he wo n't force her following the publication of an open letter to her father , ms @entity59 said she will enter a straight marriage , when her father enters a gay one			1
' since @entity74 thinks it 's so easy for me to switch from gay to straight , i should just leave it for him to demonstrate			1
i think i 'll marry a man when he marries a man , ' she told @entity81			2
in the letter published by @entity83 , ms @entity59 reaches out to her father , asking for him to come to terms with the fact that she is a lesbian			1
in the letter , which starts ' @entity87 ' , ms @entity59 explains that although her love for him has not changed , the time has come for her father to accept her sexual orientation and her partner , @entity18 , whom she has been with for nine years			1
deal : ms @entity59 offered to comply with the terms , as long as the man in question donated a large part of the ' reward ' to her charity , and did not mind that she already has a wife ' i must have misled you to hope there were other options for me , ' she writes			1
' i know it ’s difficult for you to understand how i could feel romantically attracted to a woman ; i suppose i ca n’t really explain it either			2
it just happens , peacefully and gently , and after so many years , we still love each other very much			1
' now , i ’m not asking you to be best of friends ; however , it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her [ partner @entity18 ] , and treat her like a normal , dignified human @entity117 understand it is difficult for you to understand , let alone accept this truth			1
' ' i ’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who i am , what is important in my life , who i love and how best to live life , as an expression of all these questions			2
' i am proud of my life , and i would not choose to live it any other way ( except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet )			2
' i ’m sorry to mislead you to think i was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good , suitable men in @entity3			2
' there are plenty of good men , they are just not for me			2
' video : @entity12 reads some of her marriage proposals ... yes , she 's still close with her father ... ms @entity59 married her long - term partner @entity26 in a church ceremony in @entity61 in early 2012 , but it was not until news of their union was printed in the @entity3 tabloids that her father promised the million @entity153 fortune to any potential male suitor able to walk @entity12 down the aisle			1
ms @entity59 had already told her father about her wedding , and said he was ‘ surprised and unpleasantly shocked , ’ but urged her not to make it public			1
when the plea for a man for @entity12 spread over the world , the offers came pouring in			1
‘ war veterans from the @entity165 , someone from @entity167 , from @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , really just from all over the world , ’ ms @entity59 said			1
' one @entity165 suitor wrote : " i ’m interested in the offer			1
i am a male person , who also happens to be gay "			1
' ms @entity59 , an executive director at her father ’s property development company , part - time pilot , and founder of anti-poverty charity @entity179 , has maintained throughout her father 's persistent quest that she knows he is only doing it out of love and concern			1
' i understand that he loves me , it ’s just he ’s from another time and it ’s difficult for him to understand the plight of the @entity192			2
' at the office it ’s business as usual			0
at family gatherings we hug and dance			0
and we just agree to disagree on what marriage is and family is			0
' @entity87 , i thought the timing was right for us to have a candid conversation			0
you are one of the most mentally astute , energetic yet well mannered and hard - working people this humble earth has ever known			0
your confidence , quick wit , and charisma brightens any room you enter			0
i love you very much , and i think i can speak for my brothers also , that we have the utmost respect for you as a father and role model in business			1
i am sorry that people have been saying insensitive things about you lately			0
the truth is , they do n’t understand that i will always forgive you for thinking the way you do , because i know you think you are acting in my best interests			0
and we both do n’t care if anybody else understands			0
as your daughter , i would want nothing more than to make you happy			1
but in terms of relationships , your expectations of me and the reality of who i am , are not coherent			0
i am responsible for some of this misplaced expectation , because i must have misled you to hope there were other options for me			0
you know i ’ve had male lovers in the past , and i ’ve had happy , albeit short - lived , relationships			0
i found myself temporarily happy , buoyed by the freshness , the attention , the interest , of someone physically stronger than myself			0
but it was always short - lived , as i quickly lost patience , and felt an indescribable discomfort in their presence			0
it usually made me frustrated , and i would yearn for my freedom again			0
i ’ve broken a few hearts , hearts of good , honest and loving men , and i ’m sorry that it had to be so			0
but with @entity26 , a woman , somehow it was different			0
i am comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her			0
i know it ’s difficult for you to understand how i could feel romantically attracted to a woman ; i suppose i ca n’t really explain it either			0
it just happens , peacefully and gently , and after so many years , we still love each other very much			2
my regret is that you have no idea how happy i am with my life , and there are aspects of my life that you do n’t share			0
i suppose we do n’t need each other ’s approval for our romantic relationships , and i am sure your relationships are really fantastic too			0
however , i do love my partner @entity26 , who does a good job of looking after me , ensuring i am fed , bathed and warm enough every day , and generally cheering me up to be a happy , jolly girl			2
she is a large part of my life , and i am a better person because of her			0
now , i ’m not asking you to be best of friends ; however , it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her , and treat her like a normal , dignified human @entity117 understand it is difficult for you to understand , let alone accept this truth			2
