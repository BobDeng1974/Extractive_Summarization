by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:04 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 20:15 est , 28 january 2013 councils who ‘ cheat ’ the system to force up council tax bills without the backing of local people are to be punished by the government			1
communities secretary @entity9 warned town halls they must ‘ be straight with people ’ and not use loopholes to avoid holding local referendums on rises of more than two per cent			1
just a third of councils - 115 from 351 - have so far agreed to a freeze in bills , compared to 99 per cent in 2011 and 85 per cent last year			1
communities secretary @entity9 accused councils who try to avoid holding a referendum on rises in council tax of being ' democracy dodgers ' mr @entity9 attacked ‘ democracy dodgers ’ planning to impose rises of 1.99 per cent without seeking permission from local residents			1
he said he wanted council tax to be frozen , without cuts to services like bin collections or filling potholes			1
but many council leaders warns that after two years of cuts in funding from @entity38 they are unable to sustain services without increasing council tax bills			1
mr @entity9 insisted that authorities who sanction big rises in bills had to explain it to local people			1
the @entity46 has come under fire for the way it reports the government 's austerity programme			0
@entity9 said the ' wasteful ' corporation needed to curb its own spending and rethink the language it uses to describe public spending reductions			2
' you would think listening to the @entity46 that sensible savings and improved services were a bad thing , ' the @entity9 wrote in the @entity60			2
' to them every saving is a cut			0
it ’s high time the @entity46 curbed some of her wasteful ways and became more transparent with our cash			0
' @entity70 refused to say if @entity71 agreed with mr @entity9			2
' how broadcasters report is a matter for them , ' the prime minister 's official spokesman said			0
' what the prime minister is doing is getting on with making the case for the government 's economic policy			0
‘ i do n’t have a problem with councils that want to put up council tax if they have a good reason – to fund local opportunities , ’ he said in an article for the @entity60			1
‘ but i do have an issue if they do n’t ask permission first			0
they have to man up			0
take them into their confidence			0
' if the public believes you ’ve got a sensible case they might well listen			0
but councils should also stop treating residents with contempt			2
’ the threshold for triggering a referendum on council tax rises has been lowered to two per cent			1
‘ democracy dodgers who try creep in under the radar , putting up their stealth tax by 1.99 per cent in a bid to avoid our 2 percent referendum threshold , need a reality check , ’ mr @entity9 said			1
‘ we will take into consideration anybody cheating their taxpayers			2
anybody using loopholes will lose out next year			1
’ local authorities had to cut waste , innovate and focus on ‘ putting people first ’ , mr @entity9 add			1
‘ what residents really want is cuts to taxes not bin collections ; potholes filled not pockets			2
councils that put their people first , will get the idea			2
to those that do n’t we ’re sending out a message loud and clear			0
‘ the days of the knee jerk tax and spend hike are over			0
and there is a clear dividing line here			0
we want to freeze council tax and save on average families 72 pounds a year on a band d property			1
@entity142 scoff at this and brand it a gimmick			0
it just shows how out of touch they are			0
’ however sir @entity149 , chairman of the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) , said : ' councils have the skills , confidence and ambition to lead our communities , but to see the true benefits of local decision - making , particularly around creating the right environment for stimulating economic growth , we need the freedom to make independent decisions about local issues			1
' @entity163 is one of the most centralised democracies in the world			0
even within our own @entity168 , locally - elected representatives in @entity163 have less power to make decisions on behalf of their communities than those in @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
' it is time for @entity176 to let go of the reins and give councils the independence to meet the needs of their communities and offer genuine local accountability			1

communities secretary @entity9 warns town halls not to use ' loopholes ' to avoid a referendum on big council tax rises
any rise of 2 **%** or more should trigger a local vote but some councils are planning a 1.99 **%** rise without asking residents
councils caught ' cheating ' the system will lose out next year
