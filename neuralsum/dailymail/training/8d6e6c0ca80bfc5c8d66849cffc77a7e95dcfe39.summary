teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory , scientists say – in turn leading to poor academic performance			2
they believe the brain abnormalities last for ‘ at least a few years ’ after users have stopped taking the drug			1
the researchers also said there was fresh evidence the habit may cause mental health problems in youngsters predisposed to schizophrenia			0
researchers found that the steroid hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain 's sensitivity to @entity21 , which is the chief high - inducing compound in cannabis marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents in the @entity27 , with more than four in ten admitting having taken it			1
almost 100 teenagers took part in the @entity31 research examining the effects of cannabis deep in the brain			2
it found teenagers who smoked it daily for about three years had abnormal changes in the brain structures related to remembering and processing information and they performed poorly on memory tasks			0
the brain abnormalities and memory problems were found on mri scans when study participants were in their early twenties – two years after they had stopped smoking the drug			1
memory - related structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward and the researchers said such damage was linked to poor academic performance and everyday functioning			2
the study also shows the marijuana - related brain abnormalities look similar to those seen in schizophrenia patients			1
lead author @entity58 , a professor in psychiatry and behavioural sciences at @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ‘ the study links the chronic use of marijuana to these concerning brain abnormalities that appear to last for at least a few years after people stop using it			1
‘ with the movement to decriminalise marijuana , we need more research to understand its effect on the brain			0
’ a naturally occurring hormone called pregnenolone can be used to stop the ' high ' produced by cannabis and the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence , according to new research he said chronic cannabis use may lead to changes in brain structure associated with having schizophrenia			0
of the 15 marijuana smokers who had schizophrenia in the study , 90 per cent had started using the drug heavily before they developed the mental disorder			1
a recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory as structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward , possibly reflecting a decrease in neurons professor @entity58 added : ‘ if someone has a family history of schizophrenia , they are increasing their risk of developing schizophrenia if they abuse marijuana			1
‘ if you have schizophrenia and you frequently smoke marijuana , you may be at an increased risk for poor working memory , which predicts your everyday functioning			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity114 , is the first to target key brain regions in the deep grey matter of chronic marijuana users with @entity119 scanning			2
it is also the first time abnormalities in these regions have been linked with an impaired working memory – the ability to remember and process information in the moment and then transfer it to long - term memory			0
participants started using marijuana daily aged 16 - 17 for about three years – and had been free of the drug for around two years at the time of the study			2
the 97 teenagers who took part included healthy people , those with a marijuana use disorder and schizophrenia patients			0
the younger the individuals were when they started chronically using marijuana , the more abnormally their brain regions were shaped , suggesting parts related to memory are more susceptible to the effects of the drug if abuse starts at an earlier age			1
under the @entity149 government cannabis was downgraded from class b to class c in 2004 , which critics argued gave the ‘ green light ’ to use by youngsters			0
the decision was reversed in 2008 when ministers decided to overturn official scientific advice and return it to @entity158			0

the younger the users , the more abnormally their brains were shaped
however , the abnormalities could have existed before they used cannabis
