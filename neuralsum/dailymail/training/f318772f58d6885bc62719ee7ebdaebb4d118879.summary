by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:55 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 17 march 2013 culture secretary @entity2 claimed a ' climbdown ' by mr @entity4 had brought the parties closer to launching a powerful newspaper watchdog which would implement fines of up to £ 1million talks on a new press regulation system were on a knife - edge last night as @entity11 tried to head off a damaging commons defeat			1
the three party leaders were inching towards a deal on a @entity15 to enshrine a powerful newspaper watchdog which would implement fines of up to £ 1million			0
@entity18 sources claimed that @entity19 and the @entity20 – who joined forces to try to force through laws shackling the 300 - year - old free press – had offered key concessions			1
culture secretary @entity2 claimed a ‘ climbdown ’ by mr @entity4 had brought the @entity26 ‘ much closer to our position ’			1
but @entity29 also appeared ready to give ground in an attempt to head off what looked like inevitable defeat in @entity34 tonight			0
cross-party talks on how to take forward the recommendations of @entity38 ’s report on media standards collapsed last week when the prime minister lost patience with fresh @entity19 demands			1
yesterday , however , it emerged that mr @entity11 and his @entity20 deputy @entity44 had met face to face and reopened negotiations ahead of a crunch commons vote due tonight			1
@entity18 whips have warned the prime minister he is likely to face defeat thanks to combined @entity19 and @entity20 votes if he presses ahead with his version of a @entity15			1
around 20 @entity54 are thought to be ready to back the @entity56 pact			0
mr @entity11 last night appeared ready to contemplate a single clause in legislation to ensure that the @entity15 could not be amended in the future without two - thirds majorities in both houses of @entity34 and the agreement of all three party leaders			0
differences between the parties remained over key details of the new rules governing the press , including the prominence of apologies required by a new regulator and the right of the industry to object to who sits on it			1
chancellor @entity76 said he hoped a last - minute deal could be found , warning that a regulatory system without cross-party support was unlikely to last			2
‘ there is still an opportunity for us to get together and get a @entity68 law that works , ’ he told the @entity81 ’s @entity80			1
‘ ultimately we are not about grandstanding on this ; we are about getting a law that works			2
’ mrs @entity2 added : ‘ @entity19 has been trying to push through a tough form of statutory regulation for the @entity68 with really unacceptable consequences for freedom of speech in this country			1
‘ i think their climbdown from that position has put them much closer to our position , and that is to be welcomed			1
’ @entity19 said it had not been approached over any new cross-party talks			1
a senior source said : ‘ we are in lock - step with the @entity20 on this			1
any agreement must be on the basis of our @entity15			0
we are planning to go ahead with the votes in the @entity106			0
’ mr @entity4 urged mps to ‘ stand up for the victims ’ of @entity68 intrusion by enshrining a new regulator in law			1
his deputy @entity112 , the party ’s media spokesman , suggested it wanted the press to be prevented from writing about private lives			1
‘ there are a lot of things that can turn people ’s lives upside down that are not criminal offences and that ’s what we need to ensure that we protect people from , ’ she told the @entity81 ’s @entity117			2
@entity129 chairman @entity128 said publishers were ready to sign up to a tough new ‘ @entity38 - compliant ’ watchdog but believed statutory underpinning would send a dangerous signal to the world about press freedom			1
he said publishers ‘ have all agreed to have a new body and a fresh start – with teeth ’			1
what was proposed was ‘ probably the strongest regulatory body in @entity142 : ability to fine ; ability to carry out investigations ’			2
‘ they have all signed up to that and they just say “ we do n’t need statute ; the last thing we should do is send a message across the world that the @entity153 now has a @entity68 law			0
’ the pressure group pushing for statutory press regulation plotted to exploit the parents of murdered @entity159 to achieve its political aims , a leaked briefing note revealed yesterday			2
a ‘ strategy document ’ drawn up by @entity167 set out plans to draw up a ‘ @entity163 test ’ that it could use to force @entity11 into shackling newspapers			2
it said that hacked off itself would make up the @entity163 test , and ‘ the @entity163 family must support that definition ’			2
both @entity4 and @entity44 have repeatedly referred to the @entity172 in their recent public statements on press regulation			1
the exploitation of @entity176 and @entity163 – described as ‘ hypocrisy and cynicism ’ by senior @entity18 mp @entity179 – is outlined in the leaked memo produced for leaders of hacked off in september			1
a family torn apart : murdered schoolgirl @entity159 , 13 , with her mother @entity184 the document said that @entity167 has just one aim , to establish ‘ an independent statutory regulator with punitive powers ’			2
to achieve this , the organisation intended to invent a ‘ @entity163 test ’			2
the memo said : ‘ the expression the @entity163 test has pushed its way into the popular political lexicon , when in fact it does n’t exist			0
we need to define what the @entity163 test actually is			0
’ it referred to the prime minister ’s evidence to @entity38 last june in which mr @entity11 said that the present @entity68 self - regulation system had failed families such as the @entity172 and the parents of missing @entity206 and that was ‘ the test ’			1
the pm also said the present @entity68 self - regulation system had failed families such as the @entity172 and the parents of missing @entity206 the hacked off document said : ‘ he ( @entity11 ) would favour a robust form of self - regulation as long as it passed the @entity163 test			0
we can use these words against him			0
defining the @entity163 test is key			0
the prime minister can not go back on it			1
the opposition must not be allowed to define it , we must			0
’ the memo then says that @entity159 ’s parents must be seen to back the @entity167 test			0
‘ the @entity163 family must support that definition ; it is in their name that we act			0
’ the document , drawn up by @entity229 off head of campaigns @entity231 , was presented to a meeting at the @entity235 headquarters of law firm @entity236 on 19 september last year			0
the meeting was held in the office of @entity238 , a lawyer representing a number of phone hacking victims , and was attended by the group ’s founder @entity241 and @entity243 , one of its directors			0
it also advocated approaching disillusioned right - wing @entity18 mps to undermine mr @entity11 on his own back benches			2
the memo indicates that @entity167 and its leaders regard such mps with distaste			0
it added that @entity167 would say different things to different people depending on what it thought they were most likely to want to hear			0
‘ our messages will differ depending on whether these groups are left or right - leaning			0
’ hacked @entity167 confirmed yesterday that the document , leaked to the @entity261 by a whistleblower said to be disenchanted with the group ’s message , was genuine .			0

‘ @entity269 ’ by @entity4 brought @entity26 ‘ much closer to @entity18 position ’
