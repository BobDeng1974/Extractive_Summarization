by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 9 july 2013 @entity2 riders will be subjected to the release of gasses into the subway system today - by the @entity6			1
the @entity6 and researchers from @entity8 have installed testing devices and will release the gasses - which are completely harmless - in an effort to test of how they spread through the subway system			1
officials have long noted that @entity17 's subway system and its five million daily passengers are vulnerable , and this experiment will help experts understand how chemical , biological or radiological weapons could be used in the subway in a terrorist attack			1
terrorist test : the @entity6 are hoping the results of their tests will help police hone their response to potential chemical or biological attacks on the subway system ( stock image ) the police will use the information gathered in the tests to hone their plans for emergency responses to such attacks			1
@entity6 commissioner @entity39 said in a statement that about 200 sampling devices will be set up to take measurements			0
the small black - and - gray boxes containing monitoring equipment have been installed on subway platforms and lamp posts poles around @entity47			2
the first part of the study began today at 8am			0
the gasses are harmless perfluorocarbons , released at low levels at several subway stations and at street level for about half - an - hour during the morning			2
the study is being funded through a $ 3.4 million grant from the federal @entity57 commuters : more than five million people ride the @entity17 subway daily ' the @entity6 works for the best , but plans for the worst when it comes to potentially catastrophic attacks such as ones employing radiological contaminant or weaponized anthrax , ' @entity39 said			0
' this field study with @entity8 's outstanding expertise will help prepare and safeguard the city 's population in the event of an attack			0
' @entity72 , division head for environmental research and technology in the environmental sciences department at @entity8 , told the @entity76 that the study will help researchers to understand how the subway system affects the flow of air above and below ground			1
' the subways play a major role in how air moves through @entity47 and the five boroughs , ' @entity72 told the @entity76			0
threatened : after the terrorist attacks in @entity88 in 2005 , @entity17 upped its security on the transport system and this latest test is part of the @entity6 's efforts to prepare ' [ gasses ] can spread further and in a way that you might not anticipate , ' he said , adding that the tests will help the @entity6 decide which subway lines to close down in the event of an attack to limit the spread of contaminated air			1
the traceable gases will be released in seven different locations in @entity47 - three above ground and four below - on three nonconsecutive days this month			2
according to @entity108 , today 's testing will conclude at 3:30pm			0
the other two testing days are yet to be announced , and are dependent on weather .			0

the @entity6 will release harmless gasses into the subway system today
researchers will be testing how the gasses spread throughout the subway system and @entity47 streets
the results will help the @entity6 plan its response to a potential chemical or biological terrorist attack
tests will be conducted on two more days this month
