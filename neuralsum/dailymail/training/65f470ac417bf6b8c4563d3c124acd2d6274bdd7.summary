the first clue to understanding @entity1 is that his hero is @entity3 , the @entity4 maestro who probably produced more tricks and flicks than any @entity8 winner in history			1
' he is my idol , the player i have watched the most and tried to copy the most , ' says @entity13 's new samba star unashamedly			2
@entity3 is the reason he wears the no 10 shirt in the first place			0
the downside of looking up to such a flamboyant character is that @entity3 , for all his fantastic ability , did n't really enjoy the ' other ' side of the game – working , tackling , teamwork – and shied away from playing in the physical @entity23 , even turning down @entity24 a year after his 2002 @entity8 triumph and instead signing for @entity26 , even though the @entity27 were not the world superpower they are today			2
@entity29 scored @entity13 's winning goal in their @entity32 fourth - round replay against @entity33 the @entity4 midfielder points to the sky after his goal ensured @entity13 progressed into the fifth round @entity1 has revealed he grew up watching former @entity26 playmaker @entity3 2 @entity39 titles 1 @entity40 2 @entity42 cups 1 @entity43 1 @entity8 1 @entity44 @entity45 ( @entity4 title ) @entity47 marrying the two parts of football , individual creativity and team responsibility , has been the biggest problem for @entity13 manager @entity53 getting the best out of 22 - year - old @entity1 but after his spectacular @entity32 winner against @entity33 on wednesday night , significantly right at the end of the game in injury - time , it seems the penny has finally dropped with the player			1
after an impressive start to his @entity13 career following his move from @entity65 in 2013 , it appeared twinkle - toed @entity1 was going backwards at the beginning of this season			1
a home tie against @entity69 in the @entity40 should have been his stage but he was ignominiously substituted after 67 minutes as @entity13 were beaten 3 - 0			0
for the win - or - bust home game against @entity72 , @entity53 only trusted @entity1 as a sub			2
he was given just 15 minutes at the end and @entity13 crashed out			0
five days after that came his lowest point when @entity13 legend @entity77 slated @entity1 for failing to follow @entity78 in the build - up to @entity24 's opening goal in a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity82			1
' it was unforgivable , lazy and weak , ' raged @entity77			0
whether it was that stinging reminder about what was required as a @entity13 player or a talking - to from @entity53 , something has clicked for @entity1			1
@entity1 recently put pen to paper to sign new long - term contract at the club @entity91 believes @entity1 is now better than fellow playmakers @entity92 and @entity94 coutinho - 2 goals in 20 @entity23 appearances @entity92 - 7 goals in 17 @entity23 appearances @entity94 - 6 goals in 19 @entity23 appearances @entity102 - 6 goals in 19 @entity23 appearances in 2015 , he has only been substituted once , @entity53 has trusted him to play the full 90 minutes and beyond , and the reward came at @entity33 with his fantastic , curling right - foot strike that clipped the underside of the crossbar and into the net to book @entity13 a fifth - round tie at @entity110			1
a new long - term contract was signed earlier in the week and @entity53 has been gushing in his praise , hailing @entity1 's world - class potential and saying he 's a player he would pay to watch			1
on a late night radio discussion on @entity116 after the win at @entity33 , former @entity114 defender @entity91 said @entity1 was now the best no 10 in the @entity23 , better than @entity92 , @entity118 and @entity102 , even though @entity102 plays for @entity91 's club @entity114 and was selected ahead of @entity1 for @entity121 's @entity8 squad			1
what will please @entity1 , his manager and @entity3 is that the new , harder - working and more tactically - astute performances have not come at the expense of a drop in skill levels			2
@entity1 was surrounded by his @entity13 team - mates after scoring a late winner at the @entity130 @entity1 is still fantastic on the ball , he set up the goals for @entity133 and @entity134 in @entity13 's last @entity23 game , a 2 - 0 win against @entity137 on saturday , and is second in this season 's @entity23 stats for accurate through balls , with only @entity92 ahead of him			1
it 's just he is also more disciplined with it			0
it 's a sobering thought that @entity1 had just celebrated his 10th birthday when he watched @entity3 score his wonder - goal against @entity147 's @entity146 at the 2002 @entity8			1
from that moment , there was only one number and position the youngster wanted			0
from the moment he walked into @entity13 's training ground , @entity53 spoke about his ' arrogance on the ball '			2
it was meant to be a compliment , and @entity1 took it as such			0
' i know what he meant and i was very proud to hear it			0
it 's very good support for me , ' says the @entity4			0
@entity77 of course demands the ' other ' side of the game too , the side @entity3 never quite got and hence did n't come to @entity147			0
@entity1 is here , the contract he 's just signed says he 'll be here for another six years			0
long before then , everyone might agree with @entity91 that he really is the best no 10 in the country .			2

@entity172 ace @entity1 has been in impressive form in recent weeks
@entity13 have rewarded @entity1 with a new long - term deal at @entity176
@entity1 has *previously* revealed he grew up watching @entity3
@entity91 believes @entity1 is now the @entity23 's best no 10
