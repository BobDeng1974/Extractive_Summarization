when @entity2 mother - of - two , @entity1 , took her seven - week - old baby aside to breastfeed at a popular @entity5 hotel , the last thing she expected was to be told to put her breast away			1
it was a sunny saturday afternoon at the @entity9			0
@entity1 was in town for her best friend ’s wedding and was enjoying a post-party lunch with friends and family			0
when she moved to a quiet corner of the hotel ’s lounge area with baby @entity19 , she says she was confronted by hotel management and told she could n’t breastfeed because the area was for ‘ over 18s only			1
’ ‘ a young manager came over , pointed to a sign above me and said : " ca n't you see it says over 18s only ? " ’ @entity1 told @entity28			1
' at first i thought he meant he wanted to see my @entity31 - that he thought i was n't 18 - then i realised he was referring to @entity19			2
" ‘ he said we could n't be there and told me to use the disabled toilet if i wanted to breastfeed in the hotel			1
' @entity1 went back to where her friends were seated in the main bar , ' feeling a bit embarrassed '			0
' i was n't worried about breastfeeding in the main bar - and i would have done - it 's just that i physically could n't manage it on the stools in there and i could n't find anywhere else to sit , ' @entity1 says			1
' my husband @entity33 went to speak with management to ask what we were supposed to do , and it was then that we were told to use " the baby room " - a disabled toilet with a change table			1
' @entity1 was asked to move from the lounge area of the hotel because it was an area restricted to over 18s @entity63 , general manager and licencee of the @entity9 , says the particular area of the bar where @entity1 was breastfeeding is the only area that is restricted to adults , apart from the gaming room			1
he says his hotel welcomes women who want to breastfeed elsewhere in the venue and that the incident sounds like it was a miscommunication			1
‘ it ’s ludicrous to suggest that we would n’t allow breastfeeding in the hotel , ’ mr @entity63 told @entity28 , adding that his own wife regularly breastfeeds their four - month - old baby , @entity74 , at the venue – and elsewhere in public , often			1
‘ we just would n’t have a policy like that , ’ mr @entity63 said			0
‘ we ’re a kid - friendly bar : we have children eating here seven days a week on a special kids menu , we have 30 high chairs and we have mother ’s groups here every day			2
’ @entity88 , wife of @entity63 , with their baby @entity89 , general manager of the @entity9 , says @entity88 often breastfeeds their son at the venue and it 's ' ludicrous ' to suggest the hotel would n't allow women to do the same in @entity98 , women have a right to breastfeed in public			1
under the federal @entity102 1984 it 's illegal to discriminate against a person or deny services , directly or indirectly , on the grounds of breastfeeding			1
‘ breastfeeding mothers should feed their babies , in any way they feel comfortable and not feel any pressure to meet other people ’s expectations of discretion , ' says @entity114 of the @entity115			0
' for some mums this may mean breastfeeding in public in full view , for others it might mean covering up , ' she says			2
‘ but being directed to a public toilet is really inappropriate			1
any place a woman breastfeeds has to be somewhere that is also appropriate to prepare food			0
a toilet is not one of those places			0
’ ms @entity114 says it ’s important to see mothers breastfeed their babies because it normalises what is a natural and healthy thing to do			0
‘ mothers breastfeeding in public are helping the next generation of @entity98 to learn that breastfeeding is normal , ’ she says			1
her comments echo those of @entity98 supermodel @entity140 recently on the ' breastfeeding in public ' issue			1
‘ everyone has a right to choose what they feel is best for their own baby and some people can not breastfeed and / or do not want to , ' @entity142 said after posting a photo of herself breastfeeding her son @entity152 to social media			2
' but do n't abandon breast feeding because of any " social " stigma ( perceived or real ) that might be attached to breastfeeding in public , ' she said			2
‘ there are more breasts being shown on a daily basis around the world in swimwear and low - cut dresses than there are from breastfeeding mums			2
' ‘ there are more breasts being shown on a daily basis around the world in swimwear and low - cut dresses than there are from breastfeeding mums , ' @entity140 said when she tweeted this photo of herself with baby @entity152 for @entity1 , the incident at the @entity9 was just ' unnecessary '			2
' there was only one other couple sitting on the lounge area , it really was n't that busy , ' she says			0
' if they had just exercised some common sense , said something like : " look we know it 's silly , do you mind if we just ask the other patrons if they mind , or we can find an alternative spot for you , " it could have been solved			0
' ' instead , i was made to feel like i was doing something wrong , that i was just another hormonal breast - feeding mother being difficult , ’ @entity1 says			0
' if i was a first - time breastfeeding mum , i would have been a lot more upset			0
' @entity1 was told by another employee of the hotel to move to some benches about a metre from the ' over 18 's ' lounge			2
instead , she and her husband - who ran their own bar in @entity2 for more than three years - ended up going to a different hotel nearby			0
@entity1 says they sat down at a table and fed @entity19 without a sideways glance in their direction			0
they then went back to their friends at the @entity9			0
‘ we ’re a kid - friendly bar ' : the general manager of the popular @entity209 , pictured , says the venue welcomes women who want to breastfeed elsewhere in the hotel @entity114 from the @entity115 says stories like @entity1 ’s of women being asked to ‘ move on ’ are uncommon			1
but they do still happen and can knock a women ’s confidence			0
‘ we know that about 300,000 babies are born in @entity98 each year and that 96 per cent of those mothers start out breastfeeding , so , the number of complaints we hear are really a drop in the ocean , ’ she says			2
‘ sometimes the problem is just poor customer service , but really , it ’s in the best interests of businesses to be supportive of women who breastfeed			0
’ the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) supports recommendations of the @entity231 to breastfeed for the first two years of a child ’s life , with exclusive breastfeeding until a baby is six - months - old			1
‘ breastfeeding is the best way to provide infants with the nutrients they need and it should be encouraged everywhere , ’ ms @entity114 says			0
new mothers can find breastfeeding - friendly venues through the @entity115 's @entity243 also runs a free 24 - hour breastfeeding helpline for mothers .			1

a woman was told by @entity5 hotel she could n't breastfeed in ' 18s only ' area
she was directed to use the ' baby room ' instead - the hotel 's disabled toilet
in @entity98 , women have a right to breastfeed in public
the federal @entity102 makes it illegal to discriminate against a person on the grounds of breastfeeding
the hotel says it is a child and breastfeeding friendly venue
