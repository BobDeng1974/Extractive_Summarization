@entity0 will announce at his teasing convenience that the richest fight in boxing history will take place in @entity5 on may 2			1
@entity6 of the long wait for the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world to take on the pretender to that mythical title , @entity12 , is for @entity13 to confirm that it ’s on at last			1
@entity0 and the @entity15 @entity12 are to be paid a combined purse of $ 250million for answering the public demand that they finally settle their five - year argument in the ring			1
@entity0 was at the @entity22 all - star weekend as the world waited for him to announce his fight @entity0 will face his long - time rival @entity12 on may 2 at the @entity25 in @entity5 that cash - crazy neon desert @entity5 has lit up with electric expectation that @entity0 is ready to confirm what has long seemed inevitable			1
the right to tell the world is one of his many stipulations in a contract to which all parties are reliably reported to have agreed after an eternity of wrangling			0
the deal now done barring a seismic tantrum by @entity0 is also believed to include a rematch clause for a second $ 300m extravaganza back at the @entity25 in the autumn			2
the minutiae of which gloves each combatant will wear , the @entity43 standard drugs testing which @entity0 has long demanded and @entity12 ’s acquiescence to a smaller share of the fortune are all included			1
the two major cable networks in @entity51 – @entity52 , who hold a six - fight contract with @entity0 , and @entity12 ’s paymasters @entity55 – have settled for both broadcasting this extraordinary event			1
@entity0 last fought when he beat @entity58 in their rematch last september @entity0 and @entity12 have been negotiating since they came face - to - face on a basketball court and it remains a major spectacle , even though the world of boxing would have preferred that these two men in their mid-to - late 30s had got it on all these five years ago			1
the precedent for two - channel transmission was set when @entity72 and @entity73 clashed in a heavyweight bonanza in june 2002			0
the final sticking point – which of @entity52 or @entity55 should have rights to the first replay broadcast a few days later – now appears to have been resolved			0
the fee for the pay tv subscription in @entity51 is expected to be a record $ 100 … or maybe $ 99.95 if they are feeling generous to the public ! the cost for ringside tickets at the @entity25 will sell at the order of $ 5000 apiece			0
in expectation of the demand the hotels in @entity5 have been hiking their room prices for that @entity90 national celebration weekend in advance			2
thousands of high - rollers , not just from south of the border and the @entity51 , but from around the world , have been booking in advance			0
with even his lesser share of the booty , @entity12 ’s minimum $ 100m has been ample incentive for him to concede such trifles as @entity0 – who will receive $ 150m - taking the lead billing as well as both entering the ring and being acclaimed last by the ring announcer			1
@entity12 was last in action when he dominated @entity107 over 12 rounds in @entity109 last november although there were fears , justified or not , that @entity0 would prefer not to risk his unbeaten record against the @entity15 congressman , who is still the biggest threat to that distinction , the offer seems to have proved too good to refuse			1
from a @entity119 point of view , it ’s an obvious disappointment for @entity121 to miss out on fighting either one of them , but even he has admitted that he wants to see the fight			2
the pair are likely to undertake a tour of some of the planet ’s major capitals to help promote interest , and of course supplementary tv sales around the world , including @entity119 where @entity134 , @entity135 and perhaps even @entity133 might find themselves in competition with , if not taxpayer funded @entity138 , then @entity139 , who could go for pay per view for the first time			0
the boost for boxing in this modern communications world will be so huge that it could elevate the hard old game into a major sport on both sides of the @entity149			0
a worldwide of multiple millions , will , of course , spread out from the boxing enthusiasts across the full spectrum of society			0
the fun and games of all the negotiation and delays appears to be over			0
let the blood sport begin			0
the one remaining danger , perverse thought it may seem , is that @entity0 will be so enraged by this information leaking in @entity51 that he blows the deal and all those millions sky high .			2

@entity0 and @entity12 to announce their fight
the *mega-fight* will take place in @entity5 on may 2
