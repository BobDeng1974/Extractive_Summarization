with just four days to go until the start of the new @entity2 season there are still gaping holes in many clubs ' squads			1
as the countdown to action continues @entity8 has picked out the biggest problem positions of all in the top flight and identifies the transfer targets each club have pinpointed to plug the gaps			1
@entity14 problem position : defender solution : @entity18 ( @entity19 ) cost : £ 8million @entity14 need a defender to replace @entity21			1
they wanted @entity23 and have designs on @entity25 but @entity18 would be good value for money			0
@entity28 buy : @entity19 defender @entity18 ( right ) shadows @entity29 during a pre-season friendly @entity31 problem position : striker solution : @entity35 ( @entity36 ) cost : £ 10m chances are slim of buying @entity35 from @entity36 considering @entity31 's budget			2
they need cover for @entity41 and @entity42 if they are to have a chance of staying up			0
hotshot : @entity35 ( centre ) gets away a shot on goal against @entity49 in the @entity50 last saturday @entity51 problem position : defensive midfield solution : @entity55 cost : free ( but big wages ) experience and class of such a calibre could protect @entity51 's defence as they adjust to the @entity2 , which will be a key factor in their survival bid			1
bald talent : @entity55 ( right ) is a @entity64 winning midfielder with @entity65 @entity66 problem position : striker solution : @entity70 cost : free the departure of @entity72 and injury to @entity74 leave @entity66 short of options for someone who can play off a striker or lead the line while adding experience for their @entity82 campaign			1
familiar face : @entity70 spent last season scoring goals at @entity86 with @entity87 @entity88 problem position : centre back solution : @entity91 ( @entity92 ) cost : £ 18m playing three at the back will test the dubious injury record of messrs @entity95 , @entity23 and @entity96 at @entity88			1
@entity97 needs cover and versatility which @entity100 provides			0
versatile : @entity91 ( left ) celebrates a goal for @entity102 against @entity103 at the @entity104 @entity105 problem position : striker solution : @entity109 ( @entity110 ) cost : £ 12m @entity111 will carry the fight and score goals but needs an ally who knows the league and can provide support when required			2
@entity109 's tireless work ethic would suit			0
no pain no gain : @entity110 striker @entity109 ( second left ) puts in the hard yards up front as well as score goals @entity122 problem position : winger solution : @entity126 ( @entity127 ) cost : £ 6m @entity128 on the flanks and an improved supply line for his strikers is what @entity132 craves			2
@entity134 has been too high for @entity135 and @entity136			0
wriggling free : @entity126 in action for @entity127 against @entity138 in the @entity50 on saturday @entity139 problem position : striker solution : @entity143 ( @entity66 ) cost : £ 14m may face late competition from @entity110 for the striker but without him @entity139 face another battle with relegation			1
@entity143 needs convincing they can improve			0
in demand : but @entity143 needs convincing that his future lies at @entity139 , rather than @entity66 @entity151 problem position : defender solution : @entity155 ( @entity156 ) cost : £ 8m deal is close to being agreed with @entity156			1
the @entity158 was left out of @entity156 's @entity64 squad and a work permit is @entity151 's main obstacle to replacing @entity162			0
wanted : @entity151 are closing in on a deal for @entity156 and @entity102 defender @entity155 ( centre left ) @entity165 problem position : striker solution : @entity169 ( @entity139 ) cost : £ 8m anyone who has a decent goalscoring record and stays fit is a bonus as @entity165 's search for more firepower reaches crisis point			2
spot on : @entity169 slots home a penalty for @entity139 against @entity177 during pre-season			0

@entity2 season *kicks* off on saturday
still plenty of transfer business to be done at many clubs
@entity88 are still looking to shore up their defence
@entity14 also need reinforcements at the back
@entity66 are *desperate* for a striker
other top - flight clubs are also *frantically* trying to secure transfer deals
