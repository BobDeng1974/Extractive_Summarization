when @entity1 heads to the bar , you put your order in quick ... because you know he 'll never topple your tipple			2
the @entity7 waiter wo n't even need help bringing the drinks back to the table since he learned to carry 27 pints in one go			0
and yesterday he proved he 's one ale of a barman when he smashed the world record - and not a single glass - by carrying the 62kg stack for 40 metres			1
but to carry the stack without spilling much more than a drop required a punishing training regime that lasted for months			0
gentle ! there were one or two dicey moments when he performed the feat at the @entity23 festival , in @entity24 heavy weight : but to carry the stack without spilling much more than a drop required a punishing training regime that lasted for months spilled : he did come up against some stiff competition , in particular the efforts of fellow @entity7 @entity42			1
but mr @entity42 just could n't hold his drink so well , covering himself in beer in the process ' it is no longer enough to just carry the mugs , but you have to support the training by going to the gym , especially in @entity51 when you do n't get much time carrying the beer mugs , ' he said			1

he says it was n't easy - and required many months of training in the gym
