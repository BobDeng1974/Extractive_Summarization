afterwards @entity192 and @entity193 said you made the right choice			0
as human beings we have the right to question orders and that one was n’t the right one which the team said so in the meeting			2

' 2.20pm : @entity0 is asked about his future ... eyes on the prize : @entity1 is 29 points ahead of @entity0 in the battle for the @entity10 ' i have n’t said i was freezing anything , ' he says after @entity192 claimed talks were on hold			1

' 2.30pm : @entity33 , @entity1 and @entity0 are asked if the @entity11 should have taken a closer look at the incident because @entity1 extended his lead in the championship … @entity246 : i do n’t know why i need to answer so many questions			1
i do not want to answer because i have no clear input			0
it is @entity11 rules and they want us to race in a fair way and to respect the rules and they try to do that and if in @entity22 they did not go any further , they thought it was ok			1
i was not in that incident , and i was not involved			2
i have no clear opinion			0
@entity263 : we need to trust the @entity11 to make the right calls			0
@entity266 : i think the @entity11 have a really tough job			0
they have done an exceptional job on majority of calls			0
the scenarios are always different , so the same rule does not always apply			0
but i think it is a very good question to be honest because how do we move forward from that ? we are always asking to race because it is hard out there to manoeuvre at high speeds without contact , but it is a really good question			2
