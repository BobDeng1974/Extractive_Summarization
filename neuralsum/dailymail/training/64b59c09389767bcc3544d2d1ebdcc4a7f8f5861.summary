for @entity1 , the world was a lonely place			2
the autistic five - year - old struggles to speak , is unnerved by other children and is frequently thrown into panic by the world around her			1
she fills her days with painting , and is so talented that her works sell for as much as £ 1,500			1
but nothing could quite relieve her isolation			0
until , that is , a cat called @entity14 came along			0
but since @entity14 arrived , @entity36 and her husband @entity37 say they have noticed @entity1 adding brush strokes which resemble a cat 's eyes or nose			1
initially , they thought it was just a coincidence , but now believe @entity1 is expressing her love for @entity14 through her painting			2
inseparable : @entity1 's parents credit the gentle @entity23 with helping their little girl become more tactile and affectionate all that painting is tiring ! after their busy day the pair cuddle up in bed			1
@entity1 's mother said she noticed her daughter adding brush strokes which resemble a cat 's eyes or nose the home - educated youngster has been producing astonishing @entity30 - style landscapes since she was three ' when @entity1 is painting , @entity14 is told by her to ' sit cat ' if she jumps up on to the table , ' said @entity36			1
' she stays there watching @entity1 with great interest , occasionally wanting to play with the brushes , but mostly just patiently watching			0
' and the pair 's bond does n't end there			0
@entity14 is at @entity1 's side for every part of her life , right down to her bathtimes , when she will even share a shampoo and soak			2
when the family go out in the car , @entity14 will sit on @entity1 's lap , and she is more than happy to don her red harness and go for a walk on her lead			2
miss @entity79 , 33 , said : ' ever since we came home with this precious , magical kitten , she has been casting a spell over @entity1			0
it was as if they were old friends from the day they met ' the pair 's closeness is having an effect on @entity1 's relationships with others , too , and her parents find it easier to encourage her to speak when @entity14 is around			1
after researching the benefits of animal therapy for autistic children the couple had tried introducing @entity1 to horses , dogs and even other cats with no success – but everything fell into place when @entity14 came to live with the family in @entity107 , @entity108 , in february			1
within weeks , the kitten was helping to soothe the little girl in times of stress			0
