unless you 're born with @entity2 ' cheekbones or @entity4 ' endless legs , making it as a model in the fast - paced and fickle world of fashion is no mean feat - and something @entity11 knows all about			1
for @entity11 , 32 , who is now dubbed @entity12 and the @entity13 of the plus - size modelling world , certainly came from humble beginnings			1
when starting out , her statuesque form , cat - like eyes , full lips and flawless complexion got @entity11 in the door of most model agencies , but she admits her voluptuous shape landed her on the shelf			2
' i can recall studying all the major fashion magazines as a little girl so i could see @entity46 and my model idol , @entity13 , ' she said of her earliest fashion memories			1
' i watched fashion tv for all the runway shows and obsessed over @entity13 's runway walk			1
' i still idolise her poise , body and skin to this day and i practiced in my mother 's heels back and forth in the kitchen			0
i 'm honored that the plus fashion world calls me the " @entity59 " because she 's taught me from afar unknowingly			2
' @entity11 , 32 , is now dubbed @entity12 and the @entity13 of plus - but it was n't always so simple @entity11 ' model idol has always been @entity13 , right , who she ' obsessed over ' as a young girl and is now compared to by industry bigwigs when she was starting out , despite being a healthy size 10 ( @entity33 6 ) , @entity11 received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape , but now she stars in regular fashion shoots , pictured in her junior year of high school , she heard about a casting call in her area for a convention called @entity73 and immediately signed up			1
she was lucky enough to get callbacks from @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 - but there was a catch			0
' they all loved me but wanted me to lose weight , ' she said			0
despite being a healthy size 10 ( @entity33 6 ) , @entity11 received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape			2
and even though she chose an east coast giant , @entity87 , as her mother agency , casting reps still requested that she first lose weight and then come back in six months			0
@entity11 has also starred in top videos with @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 @entity11 is breaking into the @entity41 and appeared in a recent campaign for sir @entity97 's @entity96 , and starred in the @entity99 line through the @entity101 brand instead of giving into their demands or giving up on what she believed was her calling , @entity11 , who is 5ft 11in , and now size 18 ( @entity33 14 ) , took matters into her own hands and created the vision for them			1
she became her own agent and utilised the urban market to achieve her dreams with the help of her agency			0
@entity11 began to spread like wildfire			2
@entity118 , honey , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 magazines were the first to believe in her vision			0
with these successes , @entity124 , @entity78 and girl soon caught onto her refreshing image and began requesting @entity128 for their glossy pages			0
she booked top videos for the likes of @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , starred on @entity132 and landed film roles			0
@entity11 says she wants to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams , helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion and now she 's starting to break the @entity41			1
@entity11 appeared in a recent campaign for sir @entity97 's plus - size fashion retailer , @entity96 , who fell in love with her when she took her runway reign to @entity145 2014			1
she has also starred in the @entity99 line through the @entity148 brand			0
' i would love to work more in the @entity41 with @entity96 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 to name a few , ' she said			2
' i want to continue to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams , helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion like i have done through my work and to also represent for the black plus woman who feels she does n't see herself in mainstream fashion and entertainment			0
' ' i also want to get back more into my acting career because i truly believe a plus woman can be a sexy lead on a tv series ... hey @entity171 , call me ! @entity11 has starred on the glossy covers of plus - size magazines in her time			1
