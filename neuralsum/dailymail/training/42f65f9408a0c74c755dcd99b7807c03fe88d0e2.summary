two @entity1 men accused of exploiting migrant workers have been found guilty of taking part in an illegal gangmastering operation			1
@entity5 , 28 , and @entity6 , 36 , allegedly used fear and debt to control workers who sometimes received less than £ 1 for a week for ' back - breaking ' work picking vegetables in @entity12			1
the migrant workers , who were mainly from @entity15 and @entity16 , travelled to the @entity17 voluntarily , but signed up for @entity18 and @entity19 under the promise of well - paid work , decent accommodation and the ' hope of a better life ' , prosecutor @entity13 told @entity25			1
but instead they were forced to live in cramped and dilapidated homes , paid fines for ' fanciful ' reasons including smoking and were threatened if they complained , he added			2
@entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) have been convicted of taking part in illegal gangmastering operation in relation to farm workers in @entity12 who were allegedly paid as little as £ 1 a week work was distributed at the whim of those in control , and the workers fell into debt , the court heard			1
mezals and @entity44 were each found guilty yesterday of acting as a gangmaster without a licence between january 2009 and october 2013 , though for legal reasons the verdict can only be reported today			2
the jury cleared @entity50 of a charge of conspiracy to breach @entity17 immigration law by arranging sham marriages			1
but it could not reach verdicts against @entity19 , @entity6 ' wife @entity57 , 33 , and their friend @entity58 , 26 , on that charge			2
@entity50 , from @entity60 , @entity12 , and @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity58 , all from @entity64 , @entity65 , were arrested in october last year in raids led by @entity67			0
jurors in the nine - week trial have been considering their verdicts since last thursday			2
judge @entity71 ordered that @entity5 and @entity6 should be found not guilty of a charge of fraud			0
the jury could not reach verdicts against @entity58 ( left ) and @entity77 's wife @entity57 ( right ) describing the vegetable picking set - up , mr @entity13 said : ' debt was used as a means of control , preventing [ workers ] from leaving or living elsewhere			1
' when work was provided , it was hard and back - breaking			2
even so , wages were withheld on the basis that it went to clear the purported debt			0
' workers were typically left with £ 20 a week , even after working all week in the fields			1
sometimes people were given less than a pound for a week 's work			1
' women 's purported debt often appeared to be higher than their male co-workers			1
such women were offered the opportunity to clear their debts if they entered into sham marriages			0
' one woman was fined £ 100 a day when she was unable to work because her child was ill , the court heard			1
migrants who complained about their unfair debt were told if ' you do n't pay , your life will be ended like @entity110 [ @entity111 's ] '			2
workers were allegedly told they would ' end up like @entity111 ' if they did not pay their debts			2
@entity110 was found dead on arable land near @entity114 in january 2012 it was a reference to the @entity1 teenager found murdered on the @entity118 's @entity114 in @entity60 , @entity12 , in 2012 , the jury heard			1
since 2005 , potential gangmasters must obtain a licence to supply workers to businesses , which are usually agricultural farms in need of casual and cheap labour at short notice , and must oblige by a code of ethics			0
mr @entity13 said : ' however , this case is not simply about supplying workers without the requisite licence			0
' at its heart , this case is about how these workers were treated			0
it is the @entity133 's case that they were deliberately and systemically exploited , manipulated and intimidated			0
' they were treated without dignity , without respect and without compassion			0
the defendants saw them solely as a mean of making money			0
and large sums of money at that			0
' during the opening of the trial , the jury heard that @entity6 denied any involvement with gangmasters or the exploitation of migrant workers , while @entity50 claimed he put friends coming to the @entity17 in touch with legitimate gangmasters			1
all denied the accusation about sham marriages			0
mr @entity13 said the prosecution may apply for a retrial on the conspiracy charge			0
detective chief inspector @entity160 , who led the investigation , said : ' @entity44 and @entity50 ran an illegal operation that left many people in abject poverty and debt and a feeling there was no way out of their situation			1
' the defendants promised their victims a better life in the @entity17 with well - paid work , but instead placed them in overcrowded accommodation and controlled their work and debt			1
' they ruled through fear - playing on their reputations to ensure their workers stayed in line and did not seek outside help - and approached the exploitation of people as a business opportunity			0
' i hope the outcome of this case shows how seriously we take these matters and will encourage other victims of exploitation to contact police			0

workers came to @entity17 legitimately before being *snared* by @entity1 pair
