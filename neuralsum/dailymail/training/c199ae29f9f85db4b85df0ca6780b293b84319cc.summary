@entity0 has faced @entity1 , the monster he created , just once before in a competitive match – and lost			1
and do you think the @entity6 manager is still bitter about the 2010 @entity8 final that saw @entity1 's @entity9 beat @entity0 's @entity10 with just 34 per cent possession ? you bet			1
' we have only played once and it was that game			0
and that honourable @entity14 does n't give a penalty to us			2
that game , ' says a snarling @entity0			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity9 's @entity18 ( right ) scores the winner against @entity10 in the 2010 @entity8 final @entity1 ( centre ) lifts the @entity8 trophy after his side 's victory at the @entity24 @entity1 greets his former colleague @entity0 ( right ) prior to the 2010 final in @entity26 ' i said congratulations ( to @entity1 ) afterwards			1
not more because i do n't say anything about that game			0
' the role of @entity0 in @entity1 's career is well - documented			1
when the @entity33 took over at @entity34 in 1997 , he decided not to sack sir @entity36 's translator and instead promoted him to give him his first formal coaching job			1
sunday 's @entity6 - @entity41 showdown at @entity42 will be their second clash as rivals			1
the first four years ago had a huge personal effect on @entity0 who will be privately savouring the prospect of making amends this afternoon			2
@entity10 went into the @entity49 final as favourites at @entity51 's @entity24			1
they had beaten @entity6 en route to the final and @entity0 could call upon @entity54 as well as future @entity57 winners @entity55 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity61 , pictured in training with @entity6 , admits he is still bitter about his defeat to @entity1 yet @entity9 won with a double strike from unsung @entity65 @entity18			1
@entity61 still bears a grudge against @entity67 referee @entity14 , who two months later was at the centre of an infamous @entity57 final between @entity26 and @entity70			2
in @entity51 , @entity0 watched with growing anger as @entity14 let off @entity9 hatchet - man @entity72 for scything down @entity54			1
then , crucially , he did n't give @entity10 a penalty at 0 - 0 when @entity74 handled			1
@entity61 ended up losing the game and the following year his job – a huge blow to a manager who revels in his " iron " personality			0
and he 'll surely be aware that the man in the middle for sunday 's big game , @entity84 , was once taken to task by sir @entity86 for being overweight , though he has clearly slimmed down since then			0
despite the platitudes between @entity0 and @entity1 , it is hard for a mentor to see his protege overtake them			1
it 's happened to @entity1 too			2
last season he was desperate to beat @entity93 at @entity94 and deny his protege @entity95 the title , even though it ended up in the hands of a manager he dislikes , @entity100 's @entity99			2
@entity61 is now motivated by chasing @entity1			2
first of all , this afternoon and longer - term beating him to the @entity103 title			2
' he has won the championship in more than three countries			0
i am next with three , and i also want to do it here			0
then i am equal again ! ' said @entity0			2
' he has n't won as many titles overall as i have but he 's done it in a shorter time			0
' @entity61 has been a champion in @entity70 , @entity26 and @entity111 , but @entity1 has been top dog in four countries – @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity26			1
they first met in @entity26 17 years ago and it was @entity1 's personality that helped him get a job on the training ground besides translation			1
sir @entity36 loved the way the young @entity1 would be able to communicate his instructions to big egos like @entity125 and @entity126 with firmness and intensity			0
@entity61 was also taken with his passion when he replaced @entity36			0
' we all had a meeting and he was angry that sir @entity36 was no longer coach			0
his anger was fantastic to see			0
so i said “ you are my man ” ! @entity1 shows his emotions as he celebrates winning the @entity8 for a second time tactically , the game at @entity42 will be intriguing			1
@entity6 have used a record 30 different players in their opening eight league fixtures , testimony to the injury problems @entity0 has faced			1
skipper @entity143 is out of the game as he completes a three - game ban			0
@entity41 's early success this season , they are still unbeaten in the league , has owed a great deal to their midfield playmaker @entity151 being on top form while @entity6 's equivalent @entity154 has been unable to play for the first - team so far because of injury though he did return for the under - 21s against @entity158 on friday			1
' he ( @entity151 ) is a very interesting player and he can also dominate a game			0
he makes a big part of the attacking play of @entity41 , ' accepted @entity0 , who is likely to start with @entity162 to try and snuff out the @entity151 threat			0
with @entity143 out and @entity0 saying @entity164 took a heavy kick in training on friday , he will want the best out of former @entity41 player @entity168			0
' i want to be a manager who can improve the qualities of players and that is a process , ' he said of the £ 38million midfielder , who has not enjoyed the best first 12 months at @entity42			0
whoever is on the pitch however , the television cameras will regularly point to the dug - outs to see the two protagonists @entity0 and @entity1			1
for once , @entity6 wo n't be clear favourites for a game at @entity42			0
their defensive resources have been stretched all season , hence conceding two at @entity184 , two at home to @entity186 , four at @entity187 and most startlingly , five at @entity188 in the @entity103			0
but having lost to @entity1 in a big final , @entity0 will not want a repeat and goes into the game believing he could sample some kind of revenge			1
' we can beat any team , ' he says			0
' we have made individual errors at the back but we have also shown this season we can score goals and beat any team			0

@entity9 beat @entity10 2 - 0 in the 2010 @entity8 final
@entity0 is still *unhappy* with the *performance* of ref @entity14
the @entity33 hopes to match @entity1 's record of winning titles in four countries by leading @entity6 to the top of the @entity103
