@entity0 has done a u-turn on its plans to crack down on pornography , after bloggers complained that they need to publish explicit photographs in order to ‘ express their identities ’			1
earlier this week the web search giant told people who publish explicit videos and images on its @entity14 platform that it would hide their posts from public view if they did n’t clean up their act			1
it gave them a month to delete any offensive posts , or face having their accounts made ‘ private ’ so that they could only be viewed through the author ’s own account			0
@entity0 had previously announced changes to its @entity14 platform banning graphic images from public view the move was widely welcomed by campaigners who fear that pornography is too easily accessible on the internet , including by children			2
however , the @entity33 company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers			1
many of the people who post explicit material said they needed to express themselves , and complained that @entity0 would be erasing collections of explicit material that they had built up over the course of ten years			2
@entity0 responded that it would revert to its previous policy , which allows bloggers to publish offensive sexual images and videos as long as they are placed behind a page warning viewers that it is adult content			0
but the @entity33 company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers ‘ we ’ve had a ton of feedback , in particular about the introduction of a retroactive change ( some people have had accounts for 10 + years ) , but also about the negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities , ’ the company said			1
‘ so rather than implement this change , we ’ve decided to step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn			0
’ the web search giant will only ban content that is illegal , or has been published without the consent of the people it features			1
it had never threatened to ban nude photographs that offered ‘ substantial public benefit ’ on artistic , educational or scientific grounds			0
the company ’s @entity14 platform does not account for every blog on the internet			0
however , it includes accounts ending in ‘ blogspot.com ’ , a free service with millions of users .			0
