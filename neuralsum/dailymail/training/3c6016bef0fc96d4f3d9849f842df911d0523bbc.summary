he may not yet be able to talk , but @entity2 ’s body language spoke volumes at his first royal ‘ meet and greet ’ : and every movement revealed a baby destined to be @entity7			1
as an expert on body language – i ’ve written 26 books on the subject – i ’ve been following the royal family for over 30 years and i have been riveted by these images of @entity15			1
clearly a calm , extremely sociable and very self - confident baby , he ’s not just happy to be the centre of attention - he absolutely revels in it			1
although he was a month older than his son is now , his body language betrayed an underlying shyness and anxiety			1
he never wanted to stray far from his parents and kept checking back with them			1
while obviously an incredibly sweet little boy , there was an air of vulnerability and nervousness about him that you can still , at times , detect in him now			1
although @entity15 is so tiny , he is already showing a very powerful personality , ready smile and very mature body language for a baby			1
his first duty , after the ravages of a 30 hour flight was to play nicely with a group of children he had never met before at a playgroup			1
@entity15 revealed himself to be a calm , extremely sociable and very self - confident baby it would be a tall order for any baby , let alone one who - you might suppose - does not get many opportunities to mingle			1
none of us would have been surprised if @entity15 had bawled his eyes out or , at the very least , buried his head shyly in his mum ’s neck			2
and who would blame @entity68 and @entity27 if they had looked riven with trepidation ? instead , @entity15 took everything in his stride			2
unlike most of the other children , who stayed rooted on the spot , fixated on the carpet or snuggled against their parents , @entity15 never gave his a backward glance as he threw himself into his new social whirl , proving delightfully curious and eager to engage			2
and his relaxed , smiling parents were clearly expecting nothing less			2
it ’s obvious from their open stance and beaming smiles that they knew he would be absolutely fine			2
why ? because they have made him so – purely by being so happy and relaxed themselves @entity88 despite the fact he ’s among complete strangers , @entity15 is already holding court			2
sitting right in the middle of the group with his feet pointing together and knees out like this implies a high degree of self - confidence and not the slightest flicker of social anxiety			2
@entity15 the bold - he 's happy as the centre of attention , particularly making sure he 's at centre of @entity68 's @entity15 this is an @entity105 baby in motion			1
@entity15 has recognised the biggest toy in the room and is going straight for it			2
his very intense gaze , jutting lower lip and firmly set jaw are unexpected in such a young baby - signalling real focus and determination			1
with his eyes on the prize , he ’s not concerned with checking back with his parents : he ’s off on his own , propelling himself purposefully across the floor			0
@entity120 - he 's honed in on the toy he wants and no one 's going to stand in his way hands - on @entity15 @entity126 toy secured , @entity15 is now showing it off as a trophy to the other babies			0
tellingly though , he ’s not grabbing it protectively - nor is he crowing - he ’s just eager to engage his new friends ’ attention , so they can appreciate his achievement			1
this is a little chap who ’s going to grow up knowing exactly how to get his own way , in the most charming way possible			0
hands - on @entity15 - he 's got his hands on the prize and is trying to get a little girl 's attention , to make sure everyone knows it jigging @entity15 this is such a genuinely joyful pose			1
@entity68 ’s smiling , relaxed expression shows that she has absolutely no fears that @entity15 is about to get upset			0
she knows her boy well enough to know he will take being the centre of attention all in his stride			1
bouncing baby ¿ standing and bouncing , strong and advanced for his age @entity152 that bottom lip may be out again , but it ’s @entity15 ’s confident gaze and the relaxed way he ’s sitting in his mother ’s arms that are really telling here			1
remember the way @entity158 habitually carried @entity27 protectively on her hip ? @entity68 is relaxed enough to hold @entity15 in front of her - almost like she ’s offering him a seat , allowing him to face the world			0
perfect pouter - jutting bottom lip suggests he 's going to be good at getting what he wants @entity166 babies love to play with their mum ’s hair , and @entity15 ’s gesture shows they have a playful , tactile relationship			0
it ’s also very interesting to see that @entity68 holds @entity15 at eye level , yet still allows a gap between their bodies			0
this is a gesture of equals – @entity158 was a great hugger , but the less confident @entity27 would have buried his face in his mum ’s neck at this point			0
@entity184 - even at 8 months , he 's already got an eye for @entity68 's mane attraction @entity187 you ca n’t tell who is enjoying this cuddle more			0
although @entity15 is clearly content in his mother ’s arms , he still has his eyes on the room , as though he is sizing up with toy he might play with next			0
it ’s also clear that this was n’t an emergency cuddle to soothe him : just an expression of love			0
@entity187 - going in for a cuddle , although he 's not overly clingy with @entity68 @entity203 @entity15 is after another child ’s toy - typical of a budding @entity206			0
at this moment many mothers would have worried their child would do something hideous , like whack the other child on the head with it			0
she ’s obviously not concerned @entity15 is going to be aggressive or start crying			0
he just wants to share the game			0
@entity203 - happily making new friends ( and a grab for their toys , too )			0
