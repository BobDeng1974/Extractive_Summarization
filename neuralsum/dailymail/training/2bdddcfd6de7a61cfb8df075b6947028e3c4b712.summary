@entity0 has targeted an @entity2 recall after completing his last - ditch switch to @entity4			1
the midfielder moved to @entity6 on a season - long loan from @entity8 after the @entity9 sanctioned the deal			1
@entity4 made a late move before the transfer deadline after initially calling off a permanent deal on monday because of the player 's wage demands			1
they then had to wait to see if they had completed the paperwork on time before the move was confirmed on tuesday			0
@entity2 host @entity30 in a friendly on wednesday and go to @entity32 on monday for the start of their @entity35 qualifying campaign without him			2
and @entity0 , who was left out of the @entity2 ' @entity28 squad this summer , wants to force his way back into boss @entity40 's plans			1
' i have got to get back playing and hopefully as a by - product of that i can get back in the @entity2 team , ' the 25 - year - old , who has 13 caps , told the club website			1
' the thing i am concentrating on though is trying to come in and hit the ground running so i can help @entity4			0
out of favour : @entity0 was in danger of finding himself frozen out at @entity8 if he did not secure a move ' playing football is what matters most to me and i 'm looking forward to getting back to what i know i can do			1
this is the kind of club where i can do that			0
' the prospect of working under the manager ( @entity62 ) and @entity40 ( @entity63 , assistant manager ) , who were both fantastic midfielders in their playing careers , made the decision to come to @entity4 an easy one			0
' i 'm looking forward to working with them , but also the other really good midfield players that the club have , like @entity72 , @entity73 and other new lads like @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
' @entity4 had agreed an Â£ 8m fee with @entity8 , but walked away on monday after failing to agree personal terms			2
all change : @entity0 was a regular under previous boss @entity81 but not under @entity82 @entity83 also tried to sign @entity0 on transfer deadline day , but failed to strike a deal , which then saw @entity4 resurrect the move			1
they are believed to have a deal in place to make the loan permanent			2
' it 's a team that plays the style of football i like , ' @entity0 added			2
' they play with high energy , they pass and move and there are a lot of good young players			0
the manager told me the way that he 'd like me to play and it all sat perfectly for me			0
i 'm very happy to be coming down to play for @entity4			0
' @entity62 added : ' @entity0 brings big game experience to the club , he 's played international football for @entity2 and he still has great potential to kick on in his career			1
' there 's a lot of good football ahead of him if he performs the way we think he can perform and we 're delighted to have been able to bring him in to join the group			0
