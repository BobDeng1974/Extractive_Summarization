with princess @entity2 days away from giving birth , @entity1 's @entity0 was forced to draft in sister @entity4 as his date last night			1
the @entity1 royal was at the @entity7 at the @entity8 and looked in good spirits , cheerfully giving his sibling a smacking kiss on the cheek as she arrived to join him			1
for her part , @entity4 , 49 , was chic in a tailored cream boucle jacket and neatly tailored trousers , and accessorised the look with a bright slick of red lipstick			2
fight @entity36 is a personal project of princess @entity4 's and was launched to help people with @entity39 and @entity35 live normal lives , free from discrimination and stigma			1
@entity4 is the youngest child of the @entity43 and his wife @entity44 and has enjoyed a colourful career , that has included stints as a model , fashion designer and singer			2
her love life has been equally colourful , with a first marriage to her bodyguard @entity52 , followed by a relationship with an elephant trainer			0
after that relationship ended in 2001 , she married @entity57 acrobat @entity55 but the marriage ended in divorce less than a year later			0
@entity60 to see you : the royal siblings looked thrilled to see each other for the @entity8 event all smiles : the siblings sat together for the event , which was held to raise funds to help @entity35 victims birth : @entity0 's wife @entity2 , who is almost nine months pregnant with twins , chose to stay at home auctioneer : @entity4 helped auction off some of the artworks on behalf of her charity , @entity74 while @entity0 is no stranger to a complex love life , his romantic life has been transformed since meeting then @entity79 swimmer @entity78 in 2000			1
now princess @entity2 , the sports star moved into the @entity80 in 2006 and the couple married in 2011			1
although heavily pregnant @entity2 , 36 , usually accompanies @entity0 to events in @entity1 , she remained at home last night			1
due to give birth to twin heirs within days , she last appeared in public with the @entity1 royal family on @entity88 last month			1
donation : @entity90 @entity33 was among the artists to donate work to be sold at the auction last appearance : princess @entity2 was last seen on @entity95 last month imminent : the heavily pregnant princess joined the rest of the @entity1 royals on the balcony kiss : she treated husband @entity0 to a kiss on the balcony of the @entity80 in central @entity1 speaking in a rare interview days after the balcony appearance , @entity0 told local paper @entity106 that the birth is imminent			1
' as it is a twin pregnancy the birth will surely take place a dozen days early , ' he told the @entity112 language title			1
princess @entity2 , 36 , who has chosen to find out the babies ' genders , is , he revealed , under strict instructions not to tell him			1
' the princess probably knows but she is playing the game , ' said the expectant father			0
' she is keeping the secret as i asked her to			0
' ' you know , one does n't often have the opportunity to have such pleasant surprises in life			0
that is why i prefer not to know the babies ' gender before the birth			0
' with an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies , an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - is n't unusual			2
@entity136 , @entity137 is one royal parent of twins , who with wife princess @entity139 welcomed @entity140 and @entity141 in 2013			2
another is crown prince frederik of denmark and his wife @entity144 , who became parents to prince @entity147 and princess @entity148 in 2011			0
prince @entity149 , @entity150 is yet another royal father of twins , following the birth of @entity153 , @entity154 and prince @entity155 , @entity157 , to his wife @entity158 in 2010			2
but although royal twins are fairly frequent among @entity161 dynasties , among them the @entity1 couple , @entity163 royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years			1
born to @entity169 of @entity170 and his wife @entity171 in 1430 , @entity167 and @entity168 were the first and only twins born to @entity163 royal parents			0
tragically though , @entity167 , the eldest of the two , died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of @entity170 as @entity177 during his marriage to @entity144 , @entity168 sired no fewer than seven children , all of them in separate pregnancies			0
despite the lack of @entity163 royal twins , odds have shortened on another double birth - for the @entity150 and @entity187 - taking place			2
while the @entity1 rules of succession are clear , the @entity163 rules are n't set in stone , although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares , the question of who inherits what is less vexed			1
in theory , with @entity199 already in the royal nursery , the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role			0
as for which parent is responsible for the @entity1 royal twins - or the @entity163 ones , should they come to pass , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity206 says both could be behind a multiple birth , although the mother is the more likely candidate			1
‘ twins are not genetically based , ' he explains			0
' @entity215 twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two , creating identical twins			0
‘ another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised , creating non identical twins			0
‘ if either the mother or the father have twins in their family , the chances of them having twins is higher			0

@entity0 was joined by sister @entity4 for charity auction
money was raised for @entity235 - @entity4 's foundation
princess @entity2 , who is due to give birth in days , stayed at home
the @entity241 born royal is expecting a set of twin heirs for @entity1
