by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:18 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 14 october 2013 @entity2 told the @entity3 that @entity4 is seeking to unpick @entity6 's existing deterrents to benefit tourism @entity6 will ‘ utterly refuse ’ to water down rules on benefit claims by @entity12 immigrants - and is winning support from other countries for tighter regulation , ministers said yesterday			1
the government is embroiled in a deepening row with the @entity18 over so - called ‘ benefit tourism ’ , with bureaucrats in @entity4 saying there is no evidence people are attracted to the @entity6 by its welfare system			1
it says the rules will only be looked at if @entity6 could show evidence of ‘ systematic , widespread abuse of benefits by @entity12 migrants ’			1
but @entity32 has joined @entity33 in indicating that it favours a tightening of the rights attached to freedom of movement across the @entity39 , sources suggest			1
work and pensions secretary @entity2 told the @entity3 that @entity4 is seeking to unpick @entity6 ’s existing deterrents to benefit tourism			0
‘ our own assessment – our habitual residency test – currently prevents people who could be working and not on benefits from claiming those benefits			0
it is the commission that is trying to get us to change that , and i am utterly refusing to do so , ’ he said			0
@entity50 said there was ‘ widespread and understandable concern ’ over people coming to the @entity6 and being able to access benefits			2
but in an extraordinary attack on the @entity55 , the @entity18 said it had been asking for figures on the extent of benefit tourism in the @entity6 for three years but the government had consistently failed to produce them			1
spokesman @entity61 said ‘ one can but sincerely hope ’ for ministers to set the record straight			0
‘ the vast majority of migrants go to the @entity6 to work , and they actually contribute more to the welfare system than they take out , purely because they tend to be younger than the average population , and of working age , ’ mr @entity61 told the @entity66 ’s @entity65 programme			2
‘ the more @entity12 migrants you have , the better off your welfare system is			1
’ the @entity18 insisted its own report showing there are more than 600,000 ‘ non-active ’ @entity12 migrants in the @entity6 did not provide enough evidence for them to act , since the figure included older schoolchildren , students , the spouses of migrant workers , and retired people			1
only around 38,000 @entity12 migrants in the @entity6 are claiming @entity86 , it added			1
the report also disclosed that the number of @entity12 migrants coming to @entity6 without a job increased by 73 per cent in the three years to 2011			1
a spokesman for the @entity93 and @entity94 department said : ‘ it is absolutely right that we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the @entity6 benefits system and make sure it is not abused			2
‘ that is why we are pressing ahead with strengthening the habitual residence test and time - limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits			0
‘ we are also determined to fight court action by the @entity18 who want to challenge a key part of our safeguards to ensure that benefits are only paid to people who are legally allowed to live in @entity6			2
’ the government is embroiled in a deepening row with the @entity18 over ' benefit tourism ' the department said that as of february this year , more than 5.6million people were claiming working age benefits			1
of these 397,000 – 7 per cent – are estimated to have been @entity118 nationals when they first registered for welfare			0
this is an increase of more than 100,000 since 2008 , when the figure was 288,720			0
prime minister @entity123 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ there is an issue around access to the welfare system , around fairness as well as a cost issue			0
we do n’t think the current system is working , that is why we are looking at changes across the board			0
’ as well as examining benefit rights , the government is currently conducting an audit of the cost to the @entity139 of ‘ health tourism ’ , he added			0
conservative backbench mp @entity141 said : ‘ the strain in hot - spots , like my own constituency of @entity146 , is very , very acute , and i think that ’s why we ’re right to be saying there is an element of benefit tourism , particularly from the @entity151 and @entity152 , and the government is absolutely right to be saying to the @entity18 , “ thus far and no further ”			2
’ @entity155 leader @entity154 claimed there was a risk of another ‘ very large wave ’ of immigration from the @entity12 as a result of the economic crisis on the continent and the end to transitional controls on migration from @entity166 and @entity167 .			0

government embroiled in deepening row with @entity18
rules will be looked at if @entity6 can provide evidence of ' systemic , widespread abuse of benefits by @entity12 migrants '
sources suggest @entity32 has joined @entity33 in favouring tightened rights
