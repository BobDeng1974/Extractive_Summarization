by @entity1 reporter published : 21:30 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 21:42 est , 1 january 2014 most of us will be somewhat guilty of indulging in a few - ok , quite a few - celebratory cocktails while ringing in 2014 this week			0
but who knew how the order you place at a bar could speak volumes of your potential political leanings ? according to two years of consumer data gathered from @entity14 and analyzed by the right - leaning @entity15 , voting habits can be realized according to drink choices			1
while the results were varied , the summary findings concluded that @entity19 go for clear liquors , such as vodka and gin , while @entity23 are more likely to opt for something darker , such as whiskey			1
what your favorite drink says about your politics : @entity19 drinkers are more likely to sip @entity31 and @entity32 vodkas , while @entity23 tipplers are more likely to savor @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , according to consumer data supplied by @entity14 you must be a @entity38 ! a new survey shows that people who are more likely to be opt for clear liquor , such as vodka , would vote @entity43 and so you 're a @entity23 ? people who choose darker spirits , such as whiskey , are more likely to vote @entity23 , a new consumer data survey says there were also a variety of bipartisan beverages , including captain @entity50 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity55 's @entity54			1
democrats , according to the analysis , drink more champagne and sparkling wine , the traditional drink to ring in the @entity62			0
researchers also looked at what likely and unlikely voters drank			0
according to the data , someone who chose @entity67 or @entity68 wines is highly likely to vote , and they ’re likely to vote @entity23			2
whereas someone who savors a @entity72 , one of @entity75 ’s top producers , or @entity76 , are likely to cast ballots for @entity19			2
by comparison , the least likely voters were drinking harder stuff : @entity81 tequila , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
the analysis tracks with both stereotypes and electoral data			0
the most fervent @entity19 partisans drink expensive champagne and brandy , while the @entity23 ¿ s base voters drink modestly priced wine , says a new media survey by @entity15 , a firm that tracks demographic and consumer data for example , older people – those who stereotypically like to enjoy a nice glass of wine – vote far more frequently than their young counterparts , those who may be mixing @entity82 with @entity101			1
@entity102 and a team of researchers at the @entity23 firm used nearly 50,000 interviews from 2012 to 2013 to complete the analysis			1
to @entity102 , the data shows that while @entity19 appear to drink a wider variety of booze , republicans are drinking stronger liquor			1
' we added up the size of the bubbles ( on the graph ) – the blue bubbles are almost twice as large as the red bubbles , ' @entity102 said			0
however history does n't seem to match up with the analysis			0
@entity19 who are least likely to turn out on election day also spend heavily on high - priced booze , including @entity32 and @entity31 vodkas , and @entity125 , according to the graph @entity19 president @entity127 reportedly enjoyed drinking bourbon , which is supposedly a @entity23 beverage			1
the same can be said @entity19 former president @entity129 , who enjoyed drinking a @entity131 scotch and soda on his ranch in @entity134			2
@entity23 former presidents , too , did n't totally stick with the analysis			0
former president @entity137 enjoyed a gin and tonic , while former president @entity140 drank vodka martinis – both drinks on the @entity19 side of the spectrum .			2

consumer data gathered over two years from over 50,000 interviews has *attempted* to realize voting choices according to drink choices
results varied , but summary findings concluded that @entity19 tend to go for clear liquors , such as vodka and gin , while @entity23 are more likely to opt for something darker , such as whiskey
