now experts at the private clinic , @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , have made him the new joint free of charge			0
he had 56 operations but his knee became infected so doctors has no choice but to remove the leg above the knee he has now been fitted with a new prosthetic knee joint to allow him to ride a bicycle mr @entity9 said : ‘ i was a @entity56 police detective on surveillance duty following a major criminal in @entity30			1
‘ a car did a right turn and we collided , i was thrown to the floor and dislocated my left knee and had a compartmental fracture in my right forearm			0
‘ i had 56 operations , about six of those were on my arm , but in 2011 the knee became infected which resulted in the left leg being amputated			1

next month he will take part in a charity bike ride from @entity28 to @entity30 to raise money for @entity32 ‘ as the journey is so long a normal socket would leave me with huge sores if i were to use it every day for that type of activity			1
‘ @entity45 offered to make me a socket to my measurements , which is perfect for the bike ride as i 'll be cycling around 80 miles a day			0
‘ it fits with the pneumatic knee joint which is also perfect for the bike ride as it 's pumping up and down and is made for that kind of movement			2

mr @entity9 is hoping to raise £ 5,000 for the charity by taking part in the bike ride ‘ this involves using very flexible materials that make cycling easier , combined with extremely lightweight materials such as carbon fibre			2
‘ i designed this socket around the shape of @entity9 's saddle on his bike so that it is comfortable enough for him to cycle over very long distances			0
‘ @entity9 is an above the knee amputee so having a very comfortable and flexible socket that does n't rub or come into contact with the saddle is extremely important			0
