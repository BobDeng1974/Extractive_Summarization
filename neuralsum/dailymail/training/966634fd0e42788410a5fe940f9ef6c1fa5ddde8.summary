@entity1 gov. @entity0 invoked comedian @entity3 ' death on sunday while defending a law he signed that would close the majority of abortion facilities in the nation 's second-most populous state			1
the @entity12 governor and likely 2016 presidential candidate suggested during a forum that @entity16 ' death could have been avoided if @entity17 had a law like the one passed in @entity1 requiring clinics to abide by the same standards of care as hospitals			1
' it was interesting that @entity3 and the procedure that she had done , where she died , that was a clinic , ' @entity0 told attendees of the @entity30 's annual festival in @entity31			0
' it 's a curious thought , that if they had that type of regulations in place whether or not that individual would be still alive , ' he said , per a video provided by the @entity30			1
the @entity12 suggested during a forum on sunday that @entity16 ' death could have been avoided if @entity17 had a law requiring clinics to abide by the same standard of care as hospitals rivers was undergoing a routine procedure at an outpatient surgery center when the 81 - year - old entertainer went into cardiac arrest and died earlier this month			1
health officials in @entity17 are still investigating			0
the provision of the @entity1 law that @entity0 referenced as preventative of fatalities like @entity16 ' was actually blocked by a federal judge in august and the state of @entity1 is currently engaged in a court battle to restore it			1
had that requirement taken effect , only seven abortion facilities would remain in @entity1 â€” down from more than 40 in 2012			2
@entity67 , an @entity31 attorney representing abortion providers in the lawsuit , said in an email to the @entity71 on sunday she did n't know the circumstances of @entity16 ' death , or if @entity0 knew whether that clinic would have met @entity1 ' proposed ambulatory surgical center requirements			1
' i do know that the evidence we produced at trial proved that abortions are among the safest procedures and neither @entity81 nor admitting privileges make them any safer , ' @entity67 said			0
@entity83 , executive director of @entity1 , also bristled at @entity0 's claim , telling the @entity71 in an email that complications can arise from any medical procedure , not just abortions			2
' there 's risk inherent in just about anything			0
you could have a heart attack and die while having your wisdom teeth removed			0
should we outlaw wisdom teeth removal ? ' she said			0
the event on sunday brought out a rare side of @entity0 , the longest - serving governor in @entity1 history , who reflected on 14 years of state policy after spending the past year whipping up conservative crowds around the @entity104 for another potential @entity106 run			2
rather than a fiery speech blasting president @entity108 , an easygoing @entity0 mused on his record on schools and jobs			0
the state 's abortion clinic law came up in response to a question from an audience member			1
@entity0 , right , drew the comparison between @entity16 ' death and the @entity1 law during a talk with @entity30 ceo and editor in chief @entity123 , right , at the @entity124 in @entity31 , @entity1 , on sunday @entity1 is now asking a federal appeals court in @entity126 to let the state fully enforce its sweeping anti-abortion law , known as @entity129			1
that same appeals court previously upheld a section of the law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals			2
@entity104 district judge @entity137 of @entity31 ruled last month that making @entity1 abortion clinics spend millions of dollars on hospital - level upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult			1
opponents of the law repeatedly extolled the safety of abortion clinics during a four - day trial in @entity31 , arguing that that only one of more than 500 deaths from pregnancy - related causes from 2008 - 2012 in @entity1 was attributed to abortion			1
the legal battle will likely continue beyond @entity0 's third - and final - full term in office , which will come to a close in january of next year			0
@entity0 reiterated during sunday 's event that he would n't announce a decision on whether he 'll run for president again until after leaving office			0
however , the 2012 @entity12 presidential candidate has said several times in the past that he 's preparing for a run			2
it 's likely he 'll be one of as many as a dozen @entity12 competing for his party 's nomination in 2016 .			0

the @entity12 governor suggested that @entity16 ' death could have been avoided if @entity17 had a law like the one passed in @entity1
the law , which is caught up in a court battle , would require the state 's abortion clinics to abide by the same standards of care as hospitals
' it 's a curious thought , that if they had that type of regulations in place whether or not that individual would be still alive , ' he said of rivers
