referee : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) the right - back worked himself into some space just outside the box and shot through a crowded area to find the bottom corner			2
@entity52 extended the hosts ' lead just a minute into the second - half , scoring with the outside of his right boot after latching onto @entity0 's back heel			1
the @entity115 frontman amusingly celebrated his strike by doing the @entity62			1
@entity73 , who replaced @entity118 team - mate @entity39 midway through the second half , got his name on the scoresheet in the 77th minute , striking the ball into an unguarded net after @entity52 's initial effort was deflected			1
@entity8 looked like they would have to play the final ten minutes with ten men when @entity87 was sent off having been deemed to have stretched and handled in the area			0
however , rather bizarrely , @entity100 referee @entity99 changed his mind and play continued			0
bemused supporters in the stands were excitedly waiting for @entity4 to take the resultant spot - kick but instead watched on as @entity8 restarted the match			1
@entity0 's goal was the 200th of his career , and 31st with the national team			2
amazingly , despite his impressive performance , the attacker feels he still has to improve for the @entity139			0
' i 'm still not ready			0
i got tired there at the end , ' said @entity0			0
' little by little in practice i 'm improving and getting better physically			0

made one spectacular save , recovering from a slip to make an acrobatic leap to tip a looping header over the bar			0
@entity39 - 5 looked lost positionally and was completely overshadowed by the brilliant @entity0			1
he wants to play behind the striker but he often ended up out on the left , with @entity177 preferring to use the @entity22 man in the hole			2
his place for the @entity139 opener looks under threat as he does n't have the pace to operate out wide			0
@entity70 - 5.5 struggled in the opening 15 minutes as @entity8 started the better of the two			2
improved but was withdrawn at half - time - @entity4 were much more confident on the ball with his replacement , @entity71 , but by then @entity8 had given up			1
@entity73 - 7 came on and provided much needed width , allowing @entity0 more space in the middle			1
