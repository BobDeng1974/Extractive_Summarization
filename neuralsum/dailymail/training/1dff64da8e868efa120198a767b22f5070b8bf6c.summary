by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:33 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:33 est , 18 december 2013 being @entity3 positive is no longer the death sentence it once was , as life expectancy of those receiving treatment is approaching that of the general population			1
researchers found a 20 - year - old hiv - positive adult on antiretroviral therapy ( @entity13 ) may be expected to live into their early 70s - a life expectancy approaching that of the general @entity16 population			1
however , life expectancy is lower for people with a history of injecting drugs as well as those who are not white			1
cell with @entity3 : nearly nine million adults worldwide living with @entity3 receive antiretroviral therapy ( @entity13 ) which keeps the virus from multiplying by killing the virus in the bloodstream			2
researchers found a 20 - year - old @entity3 - positive adult on @entity13 may be expected to live into their early 70 's the life expectancies of nearly 23,000 individuals on @entity13 - which consists of the combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs to best suppress the hiv virus and stop the progression of hiv disease - were calculated based on mortality rates in the early to mid- 2000s			1
participants in the study , by the @entity41 @entity40 and the @entity42 in hiv / aids , were aged 20 years or older			0
changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2007 among hiv - positive individuals were evaluated by selected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics , such as drug use history and immune cell counts			1
the study , which was published in the journal @entity52 , found that life expectancy at age 20 increased from 36.1 to 51.4 years from 2000 - 2002 to 2006 - 2007			2
the results of the study indicate increasing longevity for individuals living with @entity3 in the @entity16 and @entity59			2
here , a large red ribbon hangs at the @entity61 of the @entity62 , for @entity63 men and women had comparable life expectancies in all periods except the last 2006 to 2007 period			0
life expectancy was lower for individuals with a history of injection drug use , those who were non-white , and those who initiated art with low @entity77 count - a count of cells that activate the immune response - compared to those who started at a higher count			2
the results of this study suggest increasing longevity for individuals living with @entity3 in the @entity16 and @entity59 and contribute to the growing evidence that hiv - positive people on @entity13 have life expectancies approaching those in general populations			1
for years , doctors have been treating @entity3 patients using anti-viral drugs , the effects of which can sometimes be mixed			0
but a group of scientists in @entity91 have tried seeing if using powerful doses of radiation - a radioactive smart bomb - might be more effective , and the results are very encouraging			0
researchers announced last week that in patients who were blasted with a combination of antiviral drugs and radiation , the treatment was even more effective and made the hiv virus became undetectable in the body			0
dr. @entity102 , from the @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity91 , is behind this pioneering research , which investigated the ability of radioimmunotherapy to kill white blood cells infected with @entity3			0
the radioactive antibodies were also able to kill significantly more hiv - infected cells in the brain while doing less damage to the brain 's delicate systems .			0

@entity16 researchers found a 20 - year - old @entity3 - positive adult on antiretroviral therapy ( @entity13 ) may be expected to live into their early 70 's
but life expectancy is lower for people with a history of injecting drugs as well as those who are not white
