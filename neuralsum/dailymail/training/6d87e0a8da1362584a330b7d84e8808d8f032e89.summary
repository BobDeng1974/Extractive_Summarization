the @entity0 are behind @entity2 ’s bid to become @entity4 ’ new technical director			1
@entity5 understands the former @entity7 boss has aligned himself with @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 in the hope they can become the new powerbrokers at @entity14			1
@entity2 snapped up £ 200,000 of shares in the club having been alerted to the potential at @entity4 during a visit to @entity19 with the @entity20 last summer			1
he has held preliminary discussions with representatives of the three businessman in @entity24 this week and both parties are open to further discussions			2
manager @entity2 pictured in the dugout during his time in charge of @entity7 last year the 61 - year - old wants to overhaul @entity4 ’ entire coaching and scouting structure based on the @entity34 model – with responsibility for recruiting and developing players resting with him			1
a head coach would assume responsibility for the first team with transfers in and out at that level decided jointly – in line with the @entity46 model			2
whether the former @entity49 and @entity50 manager ’s dream is realised , however , depends on the @entity19 - led consortium getting the keys to the door			2
currently with around 20 per cent of the club , the @entity0 - together with @entity55 and @entity57 @entity56 - are hopeful of wresting control from the @entity60 brothers axis presently ruling the roost			0
with the club fast running out of money and already £ 3million in debt to @entity66 , the current powerbrokers look increasingly vulnerable to market forces			0
@entity4 beat @entity68 last time out with @entity69 ( right ) wrapping up a 3 - 1 victory at @entity14 @entity56 , the financier who owns the @entity73 @entity72 team , is still awaiting a response to his increased £ 20m offer – plus a £ 6.5m loan – he tabled earlier this week			1
significantly , however , it would require 75 per cent of shareholders to approve the issue of fresh capital to the @entity57 in order for his takeover to get off the ground – a threshold the @entity0 , @entity55 – with 15 per cent – and myriad other parties could prevent him from reaching			0
@entity55 insists he is not working ‘ in concert ’ with the three bears to exact boardroom change – but both parties do share a common goal			0
despite the worsening financial situation , neither the @entity91 nor @entity92 owner @entity66 have indicated they are willing to sell up yet			0
@entity55 ’s campaign last year to deny the club season - ticket money has hardened the board ’s attitude to him in particular			0
@entity73 owner and financier @entity56 increased his @entity4 takeover bid to £ 20million given the transfer of shares over the past few weeks , however – with @entity102 selling their stake to the @entity0 – an @entity105 calling for the removal of existing directors is an increasingly viable route for either @entity55 or the @entity19 consortium			1
@entity55 is believed to be keenest on this road to power but , as of friday night , had yet to play his hand			0
@entity19 , @entity9 and @entity10 are favouring a more low - profile strategy but their link with @entity116 will undoubtedly increase their standing among floating voters			1
on friday night the @entity34 said : ‘ i do n’t want to comment on my stock dealings , that ’s private			0
i spent the @entity123 holidays in @entity124 and actually visited someone in @entity126 but i do n’t want to comment on whether there has been talks with the club either			0
’ @entity2 has been out of work since leaving relegated @entity7 in september but his reputation as a sharp football brain is undiminished			1
@entity55 bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans famous for scoring @entity139 ’s winner against @entity140 in the 1983 @entity141 , he managed the @entity34 club before spells at @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
over three seasons at @entity49 , he developed players such as @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			0
he left @entity49 for @entity50 where he won two doubles but his subsequent success at @entity156 put even that in the shade			0
they avoided relegation on the last day of the season in 2007 , but the following year he took them to fifth and in 2009 won the @entity163			2
@entity164 was the next stop but an initial second place finish proved the high water mark and following his dismissal in march 2011 relegation - threatened @entity156 again came calling			2
although he kept them afloat , @entity2 left the club for a second time a year later			1
that opened the door to his first job outwith @entity34 at @entity7 last february but after failing to keep them up he was fired in september			1
@entity2 gestures at a press conference held during his spell as manager of @entity50 in 2006			1

@entity2 wants to become technical director at @entity4
he is backed by @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10
@entity2 *'s* last act in football was to manage @entity7 to relegation
