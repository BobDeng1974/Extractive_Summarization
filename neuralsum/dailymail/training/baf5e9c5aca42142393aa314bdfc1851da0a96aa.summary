by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:34 pm on 29th december 2011 considered : four - star general @entity2 almost resigned as @entity4 war commander over @entity6 's decision to draw down surge forces , a new book claims four - star general - turned - @entity9 director @entity2 almost resigned as @entity4 war commander over president @entity6 's decision to quickly draw down surge forces , according to a new insider 's look at @entity2 ' 37 - year @entity14 career			1
but @entity2 decided that resigning would be a ' selfish , grandstanding move with huge political ramifications ' and that it was instead ' time to salute and carry on '			1
the revelation comes in @entity20 's book all in : the education of general @entity2 , which traces his career from @entity23 to his command of two wars deemed unwinnable : @entity26 and @entity4			1
co-authored with the @entity29 's @entity28 , it is part history lesson through @entity2 ' eyes , part hagiography and part defence of the counterinsurgency strategy he applied in both wars			1
critics of counterinsurgency argue the strategy has not yet proved a success , with violence spiking in @entity26 after the departure of @entity42 troops , and @entity4 local forces deemed ill - prepared to take over by the 2014 deadline			0
the book unapologetically casts @entity2 in the hero 's role , as in this description of the @entity4 campaign : ' there was a new strategic force released on @entity52 : @entity2 ' will			1
' @entity20 acknowledges that @entity2 rubbed people up the wrong way			1
she said : ' his critics fault him for ambition and self - promotion			0
but his energy , optimism and will to win stand out more for me			0
' the book is also peppered with @entity2 quotes that sound like olive branches meant to soothe @entity6 aides who feared he would challenge their boss for the @entity66			1
@entity20 wrote of @entity2 ' @entity68 testimony on the @entity4 war : ' @entity2 tried to make clear that he and @entity6 were in synch '			1
the book describes @entity2 ' frustration at still being labelled an outsider from the @entity6 administration , even as he retired from the military at @entity6 's request before taking the job last summer as the @entity9 's 20th director			1
unease : general @entity2 ( right ) is said to have been frustrated at being labeled an outsider from president @entity6 's ( left ) administration , it depicts @entity2 ' rise at an unrelenting , near - superhuman pace			1
he started his career as a fiercely competitive @entity23 cadet known as ' @entity88 ' , where he famously wooed the school superintendent 's daughter , @entity90			2
he went on to command the @entity92 as part of the invasion of @entity26 , then masterminded the rewrite of the @entity14 and @entity97 ' counterinsurgency training manual before returning to command the surge in @entity99			0
he was then appointed to head @entity100 , overseeing the campaigns in @entity26 and @entity4 as well as military affairs across much of the @entity103 and the @entity104			0
@entity105 : @entity2 was an influential figure in @entity42 strategy during his time as a general of a @entity110 in @entity4 he accepted a cut in authority and pay to lead the @entity4 war campaign when gen @entity114 was forced to resign			2
a @entity116 article caricatured him and his aides as testosterone - addled frat boys as they insulted @entity6 and other officials			2
@entity20 described how @entity2 ' first act was to lift @entity114 's restrictions on the use of force - especially on airstrikes - if civilians were nearby			1
he told his staff : ' there is no question about our commitment to reducing civilian loss of life			0
' but he added there was a ' clear moral imperative to make sure we are fully supporting our troops in combat			0
' @entity20 added that the problem , according to @entity2 , was less @entity114 's order than how it was even more strictly re-interpreted by lower commanders			1
fault : @entity2 said gen @entity114 ( pictured ) overpromised and underdelivered in certain aspects of the @entity4 conflict in the account , @entity2 also faults @entity114 for overpromising and underdelivering in places like @entity149 - riddled @entity148 in the south , producing months of embarrassing headlines that hurt the war effort back in @entity153			2
but the book also includes @entity2 ' own @entity156 moment , when he was quoted badmouthing the @entity66 in @entity158 's latest book @entity159			1
a frustrated @entity2 is described as telling his inner circle , on a flight after a glass of wine , that ' the administration was ( expletive ) with the wrong guy '			2
@entity20 wrote : ' @entity2 later expressed his displeasure to all of them for betraying his confidence			2
but he knew he was ultimately responsible for making the intemperate remark			0
' he also concedes the @entity4 war is not yet won			0
@entity20 wrote : ' he had wanted to hand ( @entity172 ... a war that had taken a decisive turn			0
he knew that , despite the hard - fought progress , that was n't yet the case			0
' yet that admission also presents a get - out clause when combined with the book 's account that he considered resigning over the rapid drawdown of troops , neatly removing @entity2 from responsibility if the war goes wrong			1
and the account does nothing to puncture the mythology his troops built up around him , something an early mentor , retired gen @entity192 , told @entity2 to embrace			2
@entity192 said in an interview with @entity20 : ' they want you to be bigger than you are , so they magnify you			0
live up to it all with the highest standards of integrity			0
you become part of a legend			0

@entity2 did n't agree with @entity6 's decision to quickly reduce troop numbers
eventually decided resigning would be ' selfish , grandstanding move '
