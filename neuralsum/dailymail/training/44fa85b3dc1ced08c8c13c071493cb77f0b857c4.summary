by @entity0 drug mules @entity1 and @entity3 suffered a dramatic setback tonight to their hopes of an early return to @entity8			1
the pair had been expecting to be sentenced next tuesday after pleading guilty to drugs trafficking			1
but the case took a dramatic twist last night after prosecutors said they wanted more information from the women about the drugs gang that sent them to @entity18 to pick up £ 1.5million of cocaine			1
prosecutors said they would be submitting a formal request on friday to the court for the new statements to be taken - and insisted @entity49 and @entity50 could not benefit from a sentence reduction without their agreement			1
the pair decided to plead guilty yesterday after weeks of protesting their innocence so they could benefit from an early termination procedure under @entity18 law - guaranteeing them an eighth off the minimum eight year prison sentence for drugs trafficking			1
court officials were still claiming today the women would be sentenced next week			2
@entity3 and @entity1 looked down as they were led away from the prison by guards darkness : the pair were led into the back of a prison van as they prepared themselves for for the journey but @entity73 , head of the anti-drugs state prosecutor 's office which is prosecuting the women , said : ‘ what the girls have said so far is not enough			1
‘ we want to get to the men behind them and we want more information off them to do that			2
it 's not enough to say you 've killed someone and not say how or why			0
‘ all these girls have said is “ we 're guilty ” and very little else			2
they 've given a four - line statement to the court which does n't help us track down the gang that sent them to @entity18 in the first place			2
‘ for the women to benefit from the early termination procedure and receive a reduced prison sentence , all sides including state prosecutors have to be in agreement			2
‘ as things stand at the moment with the information the women have given the court , we do n't agree to them benefitting from the early termination procedure			0
supplies : @entity3 , left , clutched onto a water bottle while @entity1 carried a plastic bag as they were let out of the van by police officers court : @entity1 stands up in a holding cell during her hearing home clothes : @entity1 , right , and @entity3 both wore black leggings as they were escorted from a truck by police at @entity24 prison in @entity118 , @entity18 ‘ we are writing to the court to demand the women give new and fuller evidence in another court hearing			1
it 's not an appeal and it 's not something the judge has any control over			0
‘ all he has control over is the date of the new hearing			0
what i can say for sure is there will be no sentencing next tuesday			0
‘ it 's likely now that what will take place tuesday will be the hearing where the women will be asked to expand on the court statements they 've already made			0
’ the prosecution demand will put back the women ’s hopes of starting their jail sentences as soon as possible so they can get back to their families in @entity8			0
without agreement on all sides on the early termination process , they will have to stand trial and face between eight and 15 years in jail if convicted			0
the prison van drives away from the prison , on the outskirts of @entity156 , en route to a court in the city centre first court appearance : @entity3 and @entity1 were told they would be imprisoned as they awaited trial when they were in front of a judge in august media frenzy : an enormous group of cameras and reporters were there to meet the pair as they arrived for their first court appearance earlier this summer arrest : @entity1 , right , and @entity3 , left , when they were detained @entity176 international airport in @entity118 , near @entity156 , @entity18 , allegedly carrying 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to @entity180 , @entity181 ambiguous : @entity49 , left , and @entity3 pose with smiles on the balcony of a holiday flat in @entity18 before their arrest fun times ? the pair pose with beers in the sun in @entity18 before the start of their ill - fated journey home prosecutors said before the women made their dramatic guilty plea yesterday they did not believe their claims they had been forced into trying to smuggle drugs by armed @entity198 mafia			1
the women claimed they had been kidnapped by criminals in @entity201 where they had been working over the summer			0
