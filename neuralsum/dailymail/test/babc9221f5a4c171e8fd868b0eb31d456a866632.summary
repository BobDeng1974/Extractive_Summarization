somehow , to the backdrop of supporter unrest , protests and a worst - ever start to a @entity5 season , @entity0 managed to excavate five straight victories from a @entity8 side which ranks as their most uninspiring of recent years			1
many fans may be loath to admit as much – others readily do – but without that freakish run manufactured by an embattled @entity0 , they would be headed for a second relegation in seven seasons			2
remove those five wins and @entity8 would have just 20 points – the autumn run , then , has saved them from the fall			1
@entity0 's five - game winning run was crucial to @entity8 's season , who would only be on 20 points @entity8 's fans protested for the board to sack @entity0 as manager and were delighted when he resigned when @entity0 quit for @entity27 at the end of december , @entity8 were ninth			1
they were seven points off fourth and 10 from danger			0
today – on the back of six consecutive defeats - they are lucky that seven points still separate them from the bottom three , while the gap to fourth has extended to 29			2
the 35 points on which they currently reside will probably be enough to renew their top - flight status			2
@entity0 won 26 of those			1
three weeks before embarking on that winning stretch , @entity0 had appeared on the brink of dismissal			2
behind the scenes , owner @entity44 was never going to dispense with his manager on the say - so of fan fury			0
nonetheless , @entity0 cut a resigned and wounded figure following a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity50 which left @entity8 joint bottom with @entity52			1
since his departure the players have look uninterested and unhappy playing for the club and @entity56 from the negativity , however , was born a perverse positivity , driven by @entity0 ’ s determination to repair a reputation so badly stained that his next posting would surely have been outside of the @entity5			1
crucially , he kept his players on side – no mean feat given their current levels of disinterest – and so emerged a siege mentality which , on reflection , was to yield a season - saving 15 points			1
reputation restored , @entity0 ’s exit plan was in place			0
he ’d had enough of playing politician , caught at the centre of a toxic relationship between @entity44 and the club ’s fanbase			0
the 53 - year - old appeared to have hit rock bottom against @entity50 but picked up the players for the winning run replacement @entity56 – like @entity0 , the sole public face of the crisis club – is discovering just how poisonous that atmosphere has become			1
it has now permeated a playing staff which , like the thousands of supporters who boycotted sunday ’s 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity91 , have failed to turn up for the best part of 2015			0
@entity0 , of course , was not without some serious flaws , and it was he who presided over six straight losses last season			0
but in his absence the club has begun to unravel			0
the squad has shown its true colours – a depressing grey which lacks energy , passion and invention			0
@entity56 is proving he 's not cut out for top - level management , with two wins in the last 14 games this sad situation , however , is the cause of a hierarchy which has stripped the club of ambition and meaning			1
with each passing defeat and demonstration , it becomes more apparent that perhaps @entity0 was not the problem			0
in fact , without him , their problems could have been far worse .			0

@entity8 would be on 20 points if @entity0 's five wins were removed
@entity56 has won just two games in 14 since taking over the side
@entity8 's players look uninterested and uninspired since he left the club
the 53 - year - old has made a *blistering* start in charge of @entity27
