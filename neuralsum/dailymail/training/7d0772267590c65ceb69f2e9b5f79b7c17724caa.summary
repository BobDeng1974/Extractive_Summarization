they are also launching a new investigative committee to dig further into the scandal , which erupted just weeks before president @entity11 's re-election			1
he insisted at the time that @entity13 was ' on the run , ' but documents now confirm that the @entity3 knew immediately that it was a terror attack carried out by an @entity13 - affiliated group			1
two emails have emerged in the past 24 hours that suggest @entity11 administration officials knew immediately that the group , @entity20 , laid waste to @entity23 diplomatic facilities in the eastern @entity25 city			1
but the president , then - secretary of state @entity26 , then - @entity27 ambassador @entity26 and other officials told the public that the deadly attack was the result of a spontaneous @entity33 protest sparked by an anti-islam video			1
the @entity3 had concealed both documents from the public			0
@entity38 rep. @entity37 subpoenaed secretary of state @entity1 on friday , demanding answers to questions about how the @entity11 administration hid documents from the public that show the involvement of an @entity13 affiliate in the @entity7 attack was recognized immediately four @entity47 including the @entity23 ambassador to @entity25 died on september 11 , 2012 after @entity50 militants launched military - style assaults on @entity23 diplomatic facilities in @entity7 , @entity25 ' compliance with a subpoena for documents is not a game , ' @entity37 wrote @entity1 ( pictured ) -- reacting to the release of emails that the @entity3 has hidden from public view for 19 months one showed deputy national security adviser @entity59 setting up a conference call to coach @entity61 on emphasizing the video during tv interviews			1
that email was only made public on wednesday because of a lawsuit from the center - right group @entity66			2
@entity68 @entity67 rep. @entity67 released the other email thursday night			0
former @entity71 investigative reporter @entity70 first reported that it showed assistant secretary of state @entity73 writing to senior officials within hours of the @entity7 attack to explain that she had told @entity25 's @entity23 ambassador ' the group that conducted the attacks – @entity79 – is affiliated with @entity81 extremists			1
' ' if the video was a cause ' of the @entity7 attack , ' @entity67 asked @entity70 , ' why did @entity73 of the @entity3 tell the @entity25 ambassador that @entity20 was responsible for the attack ? ' another @entity3 email in the same chain , sent while the attacks were still underway , noted that ' the extremist group @entity79 has taken credit for the attack in @entity7 , ' and that the @entity23 had asked @entity25 's president and prime minister ' to pursue @entity79			1
' four americans , including @entity23 ambassador @entity94 , were killed in the @entity7 attacks			2

' compliance with a subpoena for documents is not a game , ' @entity37 wrote			0
assistant secretary of state @entity73 acknowledged in an email just hours after the deadly attack on @entity23 diplomatic buildings in @entity7 that it was the work of @entity20 , an @entity13 - affiliated militant group the email from @entity129 , assistant secretary for @entity130 and @entity131 , was withheld from public view ' the fact that these documents were withheld from @entity135 for more than 19 months is alarming			1
the @entity3 is not entitled to delay responsive materials because it is embarrassing or implicates the roles and actions of senior officials			0
' @entity108 rep. @entity142 will reportedly chair the special ' select ' committee , a bipartisan panel that will have broad subpoena power and the ability to interrogate witnesses at length			0
a @entity142 spokeswoman would n't confirm his selection on friday , referring questions to @entity154 speaker @entity153 's office			2
ordinary congressional committees typically allow members five minutes each for questions , a short enough time for witnesses to stall for time			0
@entity153 said friday that the @entity154 will vote to establish the committee , a formality since his @entity38 conference is the controlling majority			0
' @entity47 learned this week that the @entity164 is so intent on obstructing the truth about @entity7 that it is even willing to defy subpoenas issued by the standing committees of the @entity168 , ' @entity153 said in a statement			2
speaker of the house rep. @entity153 said friday that a @entity154 vote will establish a ' select ' committee to investigate the @entity7 debacle @entity108 @entity38 rep. @entity142 's name is being floated as a likely chairman of the new committee ' the administration 's withholding of documents – emails showing greater @entity154 involvement in misleading the @entity23 people – is a flagrant violation of trust and undermines the basic principles of oversight upon which our system of government is built			1
and it forces us to ask the question , what else about @entity7 is the @entity11 administration still hiding from the @entity23 people ? ' the select committee will take over the work previously done by the @entity196 and oversight committees , and will likely count among its members many of those committees ' members			2
' @entity47 died at the hands of terrorists nearly 20 months ago , and we are still missing answers , accountability , and justice , ' @entity153 said			0
@entity207 chairman @entity206 said in a statement that ' the @entity23 people want and deserve to know why the @entity11 @entity154 and @entity209 decided their political press strategy was more important than providing honest answers to the @entity23 people			1
' ' after a federal court forced the @entity154 to turn over emails about @entity7 , it became clear that the administration attempted to mislead the @entity23 people			0
when confronted with this evidence , they continue to offer denials , non-answers , and lies			0
at this point , they ’re lying about their lies			2
