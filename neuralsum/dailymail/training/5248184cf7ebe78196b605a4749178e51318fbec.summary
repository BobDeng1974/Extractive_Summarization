@entity0 is happy for @entity1 to be branded ' the most boring team in the world ' just as long as they win			1
the @entity5 lock proved central to @entity1 's set - piece pummelling of @entity7 that yielded a 26 - 17 victory in saturday 's final autumn test at @entity10			1
@entity1 salvaged some november series pride following damaging defeats to @entity13 and @entity14 thanks to two @entity15 tries , both direct results of total scrum dominance			2
@entity5 lock @entity0 ( left ) has impressed for @entity1 throughout the november series @entity0 ( left ) rises hight to claim a lineout during his sides 26 - 17 victory over the @entity7 at @entity10 @entity23 's side continue to struggle for fluency and continuity behind the scrum , but @entity0 called on @entity1 to grind to victories through 10 - man rugby whenever necessary			1
' people can say we 're the most boring team in the world if they want , but at the end of the day , winning is winning , ' said @entity0			2
' no one cares about style if you lose : no one is going to say , " oh , you lost by three points , but you played so excitingly "			0
@entity1 's scrum was dominant throughout the contest with the @entity7 pack struggling to cope ' people might talk about that for a day , but two months later , three months later , three years , six years later , nobody cares : people only care about results			1
' we 're in the business of producing results , so we 're bitterly disappointed about the first two results , very pleased with the second two			0
' so we 'll build on that momentum and carry that into the @entity52			2
' the @entity1 scrum will cause @entity55 many sleepless nights in the coming months boss @entity23 continued to claim that @entity1 will gain no psychological advantage through saturday 's victory at next year 's @entity59			1
the importance can not be underestimated however of avoiding not just a sixth defeat in seven matches but also a seventh consecutive loss to one of the three southern hemisphere superpowers			0
@entity1 will host @entity7 at @entity10 in a @entity66 a rematch next year : whatever @entity70 's protestations , the scale of this scrummage - based victory will still resonate come that saturday , october 3 collision			1
@entity15 gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score @entity1 's first try head coach @entity23 is no nearer to unearthing his @entity59 midfield combination , despite steady tactical work from fly - half @entity80			1
@entity82 , restored after a four - @entity84 exile , was overawed by @entity85 in the centre , with @entity87 as combative in defence and limited in attack as ever			0
@entity0 underscored @entity1 's tight - five depth by excelling across the autumn in the absence of the injured @entity93			1
the former @entity95 and @entity96 lock admitted @entity1 scented scrum blood almost from the start against the @entity7			2
@entity1 's scrum demolished the @entity101 pack which allowed @entity15 to drive over for his second try ' that 's the nature of international rugby : if you can pile pressure on the opposition eventually you will get your reward , ' said @entity0			1
' the first couple of scrums , to be fair they came at us ; and it was a pretty stern contest			0
' but in the third or fourth scrum , we got the ball in , we kept it in , and they decided " right , let 's start defending now "			0
' that 's the green light : think " well , you can defend all you want , we 're going to take a penalty here "			0
@entity121 ( centre ) celebrates victory with props @entity125 ( left ) and @entity126 ' we 've got some really credible threats up front ; @entity129 and @entity130 are in great form			0
' then there 's @entity133 going well and @entity134 when he came on , so we 've got some great players in the front row			0
' @entity1 achieved november pack potency without crocked front - line stars @entity138 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			2
@entity0 expects an exciting @entity52 campaign should @entity1 report a cleaner bill of health , but still hopes to retain his place even amid sterner competition			1
@entity23 ( second right ) , with coaches ( from left ) @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 ' it 's been quite a long time in the wilderness for me , so to get back and have four starts in four very strong pack performances , i would like to say i was a key part of that , ' he said			0
' there 's massive strength in my position : it 's a bit unfortunate for me but great for @entity1			2
' hopefully i 've done enough to demonstrate why i should be here moving forward			0

@entity1 's forward *supremacy* laid the foundation for 26 - 17 victory
@entity5 lock @entity0 impressed in the absence of @entity93
@entity0 hopes @entity1 can build on momentum heading into @entity52
@entity1 will host @entity7 in a @entity178 rematch next year
