by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 17:11 est , 3 august 2013 the call came in the early hours of october 27 – and @entity2 remembers being ‘ frozen in a place of absolute horror ’			1
only hours previously , she had been persuaded by nurses to leave the bedside of her son – young author @entity7 – to go home briefly for a change of clothes and a few hours ’ rest			1
she had done so in the knowledge that @entity7 was on the mend after taking an overdose of painkillers in what his mother describes as ‘ a classic plea for help ’			1
@entity2 , 59 , recalls the tragic night in 2006 : ‘ all i could think of was that i had left my boy getting better			1
physically , he was fit and strong			2
and now , just hours later i was being told he was dying			0
’ tragic loss : @entity7 giving his mother @entity2 away at her wedding in 2005 what happened to @entity2 ’s ‘ vibrant and handsome ’ son was undoubtedly heartbreaking – but also , arguably , avoidable			1
the 34 - year - old , who had a history of depression , discharged himself in the middle of the night and walked out of the intensive care ward dressed in a pair of pyjamas			1
he took a taxi to a nearby multi-storey car park – and plunged 30ft , sustaining injuries that led to his death			1
just last week , failures in @entity40 care of mental - health patients were again in the news after an apparent series of suicides at the @entity45 , a secure psychiatric hospital in @entity47			1

across the @entity55 , there are on average 160 inpatient suicides a year			0
following a @entity59 investigation , the @entity57 admitted that it has failed to properly inspect some units including @entity61			2
yet @entity7 was not even admitted to a secure unit – despite his first attempt at taking his own life			1
mother - of - two @entity2 , of @entity66 , @entity67 , believes he should have been			1
‘ it was obvious he was in a fragile state of mind			0
it should have been clear to anyone – never mind a health professional – that @entity7 was far from well mentally			1
if the doctor who was looking after him had taken the time and read his notes , she would have seen that not only did the mental - health nurse who ’d assessed him write that suicide was his ‘ ‘ back - up plan ’ ’ , but that she was able to section him			0
‘ the psychiatrist who was looking after @entity7 had left instructions that @entity7 was to be sectioned for 24 hours if he tried to leave			1
’ much loved : @entity7 surrounded by friends at his 23rd birthday hospital : @entity7 was admitted to the @entity88 after taking an overdose of painkillers on october 24 , 2006 being sectioned means a mentally ill patient being admitted to hospital whether or not they agree to it			1
the term refers to the use of a section from the 1983 @entity97 as the authority for the detention			0
this ‘ section ’ of the @entity97 is used about 50,000 times a year in @entity101 and @entity103 drastic action is taken when someone is so severely mentally ill that it is necessary to protect their own health or the safety of others			0
the process is typically started by a family member and gp , and the decision is usually made by two doctors , one of whom must be an expert in mental health , and a social worker			0
the detention order can last up to six months			0
@entity2 and her husband , @entity121 , who was @entity7 ’s stepfather , had to fight for five years before the @entity122 in charge of @entity88 in @entity124 , where @entity7 discharged himself on the night of his death , finally admitted that it made mistakes			1
' it was obvious he was in a fragile state of mind			0
it should have been clear to anyone - never mind a health professional - that @entity7 was far from well mentally ' - @entity7 's mother @entity2 the @entity122 has issued a formal apology , agreed an out - of - court settlement , and promised to change the way suicidal patients are treated			1
@entity2 says : ‘ going over and over documents and continually reliving what happened really traumatised me and my husband – and all because the @entity40 could n’t put their hands up and say “ sorry ”			1
’ former model @entity2 is now campaigning for a change in the law to ensure vulnerable people at risk of self - harm can not discharge themselves from hospital			1
‘ in @entity101 , prisoners on suicide watch are kept safely under 24 - hour - a - day supervision – why should it be different for everyone else ? ’ she asks			0
@entity7 , a former pupil at public school @entity154 , had a degree in philosophy from @entity157 and his published novels include @entity159 and @entity160			1
he had taken an overdose before , in 1998 , but had not been hospitalised			0
he was admitted to the @entity88 after taking an overdose of painkillers on october 24 , 2006			2
@entity7 had gone to a hotel in @entity165 that evening and taken a large number of tablets			1
‘ he rang me and said “ i ’ve been really foolish , ” and my heart just sank , ’ @entity2 recalls			2
‘ he told me where he was and i told him to stay there and we ’d come and get him			0
’ family : @entity7 on holiday in @entity174 with his mother and sister in 1975 after being admitted to hospital , tests showed the overdose had damaged @entity7 ’s liver and he was moved to intensive care			1
after three days , his condition improved and @entity2 , who had kept a bedside vigil next to her son , went home to sleep			2
hours later , she received a call from the hospital saying her son had discharged himself , followed by another shortly afterwards saying he had been readmitted – and was on a life - support machine			2
the fall at the car park had ruptured his aorta and severely damaged his internal organs , as well as causing multiple external injuries			1
@entity2 had to make the heart - wrenching decision to have his life - support machine turned off			2
all those who knew and loved @entity7 were shocked at the news of his death			2
it took four years for an inquest into his death to be held			0
a verdict of suicide was recorded			0
@entity2 says : ‘ during the inquest , the doctor who discharged him said , “ i now know i was wrong			2
” at the time of @entity7 ’s death , i just could n’t understand why she could n’t have simply sectioned him for his own safety			2
i found this so hard to comprehend			0
i now know she had n’t even read his notes			0
’ @entity2 has also criticised the fact that her son was given only one hour with a mental - health nurse during his 60 - hour hospital stay			1
dr @entity216 , a clinical negligence expert at @entity218 , says : ‘ @entity7 ’s untimely end was all the more tragic because it was avoidable			2
sadly , cases like his are not uncommon			0
’ a spokesman for @entity222 says : ‘ since @entity7 ’s death , as a trust we have made significant improvements to the way we support and manage patients with mental - health needs in the hospital			1
’ consultant clinical psychologist dr @entity230 says : ‘ health professionals can sometimes feel so pressured that they avoid asking patients about suicidal thoughts even if they suspect they ’re there , just in case they open up a topic they fear they wo n’t be able to deal with			0
just last week , failures in @entity40 care of mental - health patients were again in the news after an apparent series of suicides at the @entity45 , in @entity47 ‘ not only do staff need training to spot signs of hopelessness , but they also need to feel confident that they have the competences as well as the resources to help			0
’ @entity2 ’s call for new legislation has been backed by mental - health charities			2
@entity252 , ceo of one , @entity254 , says : ‘ many health professionals can spot the signs of diabetes or a stroke , but can not spot the basic signs that someone is suicidal			0
training is not the only problem			0
often staff are doing their best in a system that is chronically underfunded , so even when they know someone needs specialist help , it is n’t easily available			0
’ @entity2 adds : ‘ when i sat with @entity7 ’s body after the life - support had been switched off , i made a promise to my son that i ’d fight with every breath i had to try to see that we achieved better treatment for people with mental - health problems			1
‘ i will grieve for ever , but i do n’t want my grief to be energy that just floats out into the ether			0
i want it to be used to create a possibility of change			0
