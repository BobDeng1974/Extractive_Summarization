mr @entity5 , 54 , a gardener , said : ' as collectors you are always having to look for rare items or what people have n’t heard of			2
mr @entity5 said the machine runs a bit slower than a modern lawn mower and it is loud like tractor ' when i first saw the mower it looked a bit forlorn , someone had gone at it with a sledge hammer and there was nothing in front of the cutting cylinder			1
' after i was given it i realised it was the first one that @entity89 ’s made when i spotted the identification number			0
' it has taken four years to restore it and i would say it was 60 per cent intact , and i had to build some new parts			0
