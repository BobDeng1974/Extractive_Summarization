producers of a long - running stage musical have axed its @entity3 tribute segment in the wake of sex abuse allegations against the star			1
the impersonator who portrays sir @entity3 , @entity8 , 68 , who is also the show 's director , has found himself out of a job because producers fear the star 's fanatical fans would ' lynch ' any audience member who complained about the section if it remained in the show			1
the popular rock n ' roll show @entity19 has featured a tribute act to sir @entity3 since it began its first run 29 years ago			1
his denial came as police raided his home over the allegation dating back almost three decades			0
the star said ' completely false ' claims had been circulating on the internet for months but he had chosen not to ' dignify ' them with a response			0
detectives swooped on the singer 's Â£ 3.1million apartment in @entity43 on august 13 , spending five hours searching for evidence after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in @entity48 at an event held by @entity51 evangelist @entity50 in 1985			0
sir @entity3 ( pictured left ) and impersonator @entity8 ( pictured right ) performing on stage now , producers of the musical have decided to remove the six minute segment in the wake of the historical sex abuse allegations			1
they say they are worried that if they kept it in and a member of the audience publicly complained , sir @entity3 's fanatical followers would round on them and cause a public order outbreak			1
as a result mr @entity8 has been ' inundated ' with complaints from @entity3 fans and was even accosted at the stage door of the @entity70 by an ' indignant ' secretary of one @entity3 fan club			1
@entity8 ( pictured right ) performing as sir @entity3 with an @entity53 as part of the musical mr @entity8 , 68 , said he is ' very saddened ' that the popular section has been axed			1
sir @entity3 ( pictured ) met officers from @entity78 last month but was not arrested or charged he said : ' @entity3 's fans are vehemently addicted and defensive of him and have been for many many years			1
' we , like everyone else , were shocked when the allegations came to light and we hope that he is cleared of them			0
' but we took the view that if i did venture on stage as sir @entity3 and just one member of the audience booed or made a remark then it would n't be a situation we could contain			1
' we do get a lot of @entity3 fans attend our shows and they would probably turn on the person and we could have a terrible situation inside the theatre that would ruin the night			1
' put it this way , i asked one passionate @entity3 fan how she would react if it happened and she replied " i 'd have their guts for garters "			2
' we also took the view that because sir @entity3 himself has cancelled all his public engagements until further notice we would follow suit			1
' we are n't judging him or condemning him			0
we all hope he is innocent			0
' i have received lots of emails of complaint from our fans			0
one person sent me an email saying they had booked to see the show in @entity120 in october but they would not be coming since we took @entity3 out of it			2
' one lady , the secretary of a @entity3 fan club , came to see me at the stage door in @entity125 and was most indignant about it			2
' mr @entity8 appeared as @entity3 in the music video for comedian @entity129 's famous version of @entity130 in 2005 and his @entity132 comedy show @entity133 and @entity134 to @entity135			2
" when the news broke we decided to remove the section			0
' it is very sad			0
i am a big fan of @entity3 and have met him and he is a charming man			0
' sir @entity3 reacted with fury after learning that police searched his apartment in @entity142 - while the @entity143 filmed live - when he had no prior notice			2
he was on holiday in @entity146 at the time and returned to the @entity148 ahead of his meeting with police			0
