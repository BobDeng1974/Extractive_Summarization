the @entity5 is set to be unveiled during an @entity10 press conference in @entity11 on september 12 and go on sale just weeks later			1
@entity10 's last @entity5 model , the @entity14 - which introduced voice recognition system @entity15 , a new camera and a faster operating system - was introduced in october 2011			1

a design concept , left shows a rounder , curvier new look for @entity5 and a larger screen			0
other tech insiders say it 's unlikely that @entity10 will go back to the rounded ' look ' it abandoned before it is also believed to be so the new handset can include @entity53 , a high speed ' 4g data network giving far faster speeds than current iphones			1
other rumours surrounding the @entity5 point to a larger 4 - inch display at a resolution of 1,136 x 640 , along with a new two - tone back panel			2
while the @entity5 launch is highly anticipated , @entity10 has also come under fire over reports of a smaller dock connector that would force owners to buy an adapter for use with their current dock			2
juiced up : pictures claiming to be of the newer , more powerful @entity5 battery have been leaked to technology blog 9to5mac it was revealed last week that @entity10 was trying to boost its declining sales by matching the $ 50 discount currently offered by @entity76 on all models of the @entity5 , dropping the price of the @entity14 drops to $ 150 from $ 200 when you sign a two - year contract			2
a @entity81 goes down to $ 250 , @entity82 too $ 350 and the @entity83 goes right down to $ 50			0
but you wo n't find the offer advertised anywhere			0
this is one of those rare occasions when it 's not who you know , but what you know that counts			0
the discount will only be applied if you mention the @entity76 sale , at which point $ 50 drops off the total bill			0
and it does n't apply online either , only in store			0
rumours about the technology giant are not exactly rare , but this one , first reported by @entity103 , is for real			0
