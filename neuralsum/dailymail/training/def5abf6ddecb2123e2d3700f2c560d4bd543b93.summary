by @entity0 kent police and crime commissioner @entity1 , left , with the force 's chief constable @entity2 a scandal - hit crime tsar has been accused of wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on a new office and boosting her image while police officers are losing their jobs			1
@entity1 , notorious for employing a foul - mouthed teenager as her youth adviser , has spent almost £ 200,000 on moving her office less than two miles , and only revealed the costs after an investigation by @entity15			1
her new base includes a state - of - the - art studio for radio interviews – even though there is already one used by police chiefs yards away on the same site			1
the independent @entity22 for @entity23 has spent more than £ 7,500 on consultants to improve her ‘ brand ’ and taken control of @entity28 ’s press office despite fears the move will jeopardise its independence			1
insiders have also revealed allegations of ‘ diva - like ’ behaviour by mrs @entity1 , including throwing a ‘ hissy fit ’ when the force ’s chief constable appeared on television instead of her			1
she has even fallen out with police chiefs by parking her battle bus , which she grandly calls @entity42 , in disabled bays at the force @entity44			1
last night one senior source said : ‘ she is deeply unpopular in the force , and people say her office is a horrible place to work			0
there was a lot of unease in @entity28 about the money spent on her office when people are losing their jobs			0
’ the door to her new office , circled , and a map showing the distance from the old site another insider added : ‘ it ’s all about “ @entity65 ” with her			0
she just gets people ’s backs up			0
’ cllr @entity68 , vice-chairman of the @entity69 which scrutinises the @entity22 , said : ‘ the public will be mystified as to how the rhetoric of leaving no stone unturned to save the jobs of front line officers has turned into the reality of no - expense - spared office moves , duplicating radio studios and expensive media consultancy			2
perhaps the media consultants can advise mrs @entity1 to come clean to the people of @entity23 about her excessive expenditure			2
’ her foul aide : our story last year mrs @entity1 , paid £ 85,000 a year , was elected as the first @entity22 in @entity23 in november 2012 despite previously branding the government ’s plan to increase police accountability a ‘ wilful waste of money ’			1
she became the most high - profile of the country ’s 41 crime tsars a year ago when @entity15 revealed her £ 15,000 youth commissioner , @entity93 , 17 , had posted a series of highly offensive comments online			0
mrs @entity1 is in charge of a single pot of money that must pay for her own office and @entity28 , and chiefs have warned that as many as 100 extra officer posts could be lost when £ 20million is cut from the budget in 2015 - 16			1
yet last august , mrs @entity1 moved her staff from her old @entity105 offices in central @entity106 to @entity107 on the outskirts of the town – 1.8 miles away			0
sources in the force claim she was offered use of a building at one end of the complex , but refused because it was next to a parade of takeaway food shops			0
@entity1 has been accused of parking her ' bus ' in disabled spaces ‘ she was n’t going to have that because they would be able to smell the chips , ’ one source @entity123 , she uprooted the firearms licensing team to take over its rooms , and had a new public entrance built to her office complete with signs , new doors and expensively refurbished sash windows			2
inside her office , mrs @entity1 had a soundproofed studio constructed complete with the latest isdn connections so she could do live radio interviews – even though there is an identical facility yards away in the control room of the police hq site			1
although the move took place last summer , mrs @entity1 is paying rent on her old offices in @entity144 – £ 59,000 a year – until this june			2
a sign pointing to the office door but despite being required by law to publish all her spending on items costing more than £ 500 , the details were not made public until this newspaper asked questions about them this week			0
the only related expenditure listed on mrs @entity1 ’s website , until this weekend , was £ 1,408 paid to a local removals firm			2
on friday evening , after @entity15 asked a series of detailed questions about mrs @entity1 ’s spending , she published an article on her website titled : ‘ public money set to be saved after office move			1
’ she said : ‘ had i renewed the @entity106 office contract it would have been one of the most expensive buildings on the police estate			0
i just could n’t justify this during times of police cuts			0
‘ the move from @entity106 town centre to the excess space at @entity174 will save around £ 250k over the next five years , and even more in the years after that			0
’ mrs @entity1 claimed the move cost £ 150,000 excluding vat – so with the tax added it would reach £ 180,000 , not including the continued rent on the old building or the construction of the radio studio			1
a spokesman for mrs @entity1 declined to comment on the allegations about her behaviour , saying : ‘ these are based on hearsay			0
