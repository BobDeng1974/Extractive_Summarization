by @entity1 reporter most family disputes do n't make headlines			2
but most families do n't have the last name of @entity6 , and most disputes are n't over an art collection forth tens of millions of dollars			0
but that 's exactly what 's about to play out in a @entity12 courtroom after descendents of eccentric , millionaire art collector @entity14 decided to sue the @entity15 - to which @entity14 left her vast collection of expensive art - over claims that the foundation is not honoring the wishes of the deceased heiress			1
essentially , the family feels the foundation is cheapening the collection by allowing other artists to display their collections at an @entity27 palazzo in @entity28 that was left to the foundation as part of the collection			1
dispute : the center of the dispute is this palazzo in @entity6 left to the @entity15 the palazzo is actually home to the tomb of @entity14 - and 14 of her dogs			1
the last straw for the family appears to have come when the foundation put the names of @entity43 and @entity44 on an entrance to the palazzo that also has the name of @entity6 - and dogs with names like @entity50 and sir ; @entity6 's ' beloved babies , ' according to the @entity53			1
the @entity54 are the parents of @entity15 trustee @entity55 , who included some of his family 's collection with @entity6 's at the @entity59 in @entity28			2
as is : the family claims the collection was to stay as it was when @entity14 owned it , and the addition of names and artwork go against her wishes ' they are totally disrespecting my great grandmother ’s legacy , ' @entity6 's great grandson @entity67 , 27 , told @entity71			1
' basically … if you have [ enough ] money and you have a collection , you can show it at the @entity14 in @entity28			0
' @entity14 left her collection - at the time worth about $ 40 million - the the foundation in 1975 , four years before her 1979 death			2
the family claims that the collection was given to the foundation on the condition that it stay together and not be altered in any way - not only does the family claim that pieces of the collection can not be sold , they also claim pieces ca n't be added to the collection			1
according to the family , of the 181 pieces currently on display at the palazzo , 75 are from the recently added @entity44 collection			0
eccentric : @entity14 is the daughter of @entity96 , who left her a $ 2.5 million inheritance when he died in the sinking of the @entity99 additionally , the family also accuses the foundation of desecrating @entity6 's grave because her tomb is in the palazzo in what is now a ' sculpture garden ' that is often used for cocktail parties			1
what once was @entity14 's grave is now ' @entity110 ' - named after @entity111 billionaires @entity112 and @entity113			1
@entity67 's mother , art writer @entity115 , told @entity116 that the foundation was using the @entity28 palazzo as ' an extraordinary cash machine ' and that it should be turned over to a non-profit committee			0
the foundation , however , claims there were no specific demands made by @entity6 about how her collection was to be used			0
memorial : the names of some of @entity6 's dogs - like @entity50 and sir - can also be found at the palazzo ' [ @entity133 ] efforts have only honoured , preserved and enhanced the memory and reputation of @entity14 , ' @entity131 , a @entity6 spokeswoman , told @entity71			2
why is a dispute over something in @entity27 being resolved in a @entity12 court ? as the publication explains , ' like any good family quarrel , this one goes back a long way			0
the @entity12 judicial system declared itself competent to intervene when two “ branches ” of the @entity145 last fell out 22 years ago			0
seven of @entity14 ’s @entity147 - based descendants have now asked the @entity12 courts to intervene again			0

the family claims a palazzo @entity14 *donated* to the @entity15 is n't being used as the heiress *intended*
@entity14 's family claims the palazzo was not to be altered
the foundation , however , has added artwork , and the names of other *donors* to the @entity27 *gallery*
the family feels the additions are cheapening the palazzo
