by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:08 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 17:14 est , 16 july 2013 eleven of the 14 hospital trusts investigated by sir @entity4 have been put into ‘ special measures ’ and hit squads will be sent in to help them improve care , @entity2 announced yesterday			1
these experts may decide to sack chief executives and other top managers if they think they are not up to scratch – although officials will be handed a stay of execution to see if they can turn their hospitals around			2
the 11 ‘ mediocre ’ @entity16 trusts in special measures are : @entity17 ; @entity18 and @entity19 ; @entity20 ; @entity21 ; @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity24 ; @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 ; @entity32 ; and @entity33 , @entity34			1
victim : @entity36 , 35 , pictured with fiancee @entity37 , was mistaken for a drunk by hospital staff in @entity22 , @entity24 , when in fact he had a fatal brain tumour three other trusts – based in @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 – will not be put into special measures and have been given the chance to improve care themselves			1
six of the 11 going into special measures are ‘ foundation ’ trusts – a coveted status brought in under @entity52 which was meant to reward the best - performing hospitals			1
they are : @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity25 , @entity31 and @entity33			0
sir @entity4 said : ‘ mediocrity is simply not good enough and , based on the findings from this review i have set out an achievable ambition which will help these hospitals improve dramatically over the next two years			0
’ mr @entity2 said that 11 of the trusts would be put into ‘ special measures ’ for ‘ fundamental breaches of care ’			1
he told @entity65 : ‘ no statistics are perfect but mortality rates suggest that since 2005 thousands more people may have died that would normally be expected at the 14 trusts reviewed			2
’ @entity22 & @entity23 victims included @entity36 , 35 , who died after nurses ignored the fact that he had a brain tumour , instead believing he was just ‘ a drunk ’			0
@entity76 , 30 , lost her unborn baby after she was refused a scan because of a lack of staff			0
and disabled @entity81 , 23 , died from pneumonia after doctors missed numerous chances to save her life			0
double tragedy @entity76 ( left ) lost her unborn baby after she was refused a scan , while @entity81 died from pneumonia after a series of blunders @entity32 @entity25 @entity91 widow @entity92 died from the superbug @entity93 after she was admitted with a routine stomach bug by numbers : @entity16 in the labour years @entity28 @entity33 @entity97 @entity98 & @entity19 @entity31 @entity20 victims included @entity92 , 79 , who was admitted with a routine stomach problem but died from the superbug @entity101 difficile six weeks later after a catalogue of medical blunders			0
@entity105 the three trusts which had high death rates but which will not be placed in special measures are : @entity45 @entity44 @entity43 receptionists are deciding how swiftly patients are seen in @entity111 because of an extraordinary shortage of nurses , according to the report			1
the administrative staff are making decisions which would normally be taken by taken by medical practitioners			0
@entity118 , nurse director for @entity119 and @entity120 , said : ‘ in some hospitals , in some ward areas , there was inadequate staffing – we heard from patients about call bells going off for longer periods than they should have been			1
i held the hand of a patient – just to comfort them – because the nurses did not have sufficient time to do that			2
the @entity133 in @entity134 which is part of the @entity136 which has been under review by @entity138 medical director professor sir @entity4 health secretary @entity2 made a statement about the damning report ‘ i observed some aspects of care that did lack compassion			0
i would argue that we saw that at the same time as seeing poor levels of staffing			2
’ the report found nursing shortages at all 14 organisations – particularly at nights and weekends – with some nurses left on their own in charge of 15 patients			1
inspectors also found receptionists deciding how quickly patients are seen in @entity111 at @entity136			1
patients are told to tell staff on the front desk if they have chest pain otherwise they join the back of the queue			1
the inspectors found a queue of eight patients waiting to be assessed by a secretary at the casualty unit at princess @entity169 hospital in @entity170 , part of the @entity21 and @entity16 trust			1
earlier this year a major study found that patients are 10 per cent more likely to die if there are not enough nurses on wards as they are more likely to suffer complications			2
yet official figures show that the numbers of nurses in the @entity16 has increased by a third since 1997 – when @entity52 came to power – up from 261,000 to 350,000 today			2
healthcare experts and unions argue that more nurses are needed on the wards compared to several decades ago as higher numbers of patients in hospital are elderly and require dedicated care			1
but the @entity191 is concerned that the government has begun slashing nurses ’ posts and claims that 6,000 have been lost since 2010			0
yesterday the @entity191 and @entity195 demanded that the @entity16 impose compulsory safe staffing levels with minimum numbers of nurses on each wards			1
dr @entity200 , general secretary of the @entity191 , said : ‘ there ’s an undeniable link between nurse staffing levels and patient mortality and we ca n’t keep failing to address this issue			1
’ 1997 : @entity52 wins the election and takes charge of an @entity16 budget of just over £ 33billion			2
at first , it sticks to @entity210 spending limits			0
2000 : @entity212 goes on @entity213 to announce plans to increase @entity16 spending to bring it up to the @entity218 average , without warning @entity219 2000 : @entity221 ’s @entity16 plan imposes targets to reduce waiting lists , later blamed for prompting managers to ignore care standards			0
he also says thousands more nurses will be trained 2001 : @entity219 unveils five - year spending plan to bring the @entity16 budget up to @entity218 levels by 2008 2002 : an independent review by @entity232 boss @entity231 calls for a huge increase in @entity16 spending			2
@entity219 responds with a 1p rise in @entity236			0
2003 : but much of the money goes towards a top - down reorganisation of the @entity16 , such as the formation of foundation trusts and the replacement of health authorities with primary care trusts			1
2004 : much of the extra money goes not to patients but towards extra pay for gps and consultants , who see their pay soar at the same time as opting out of responsibility for out - of - hours care			1
2006 : despite all the billions , a third of trusts face severe financial problems			0
many are forced to close wards and cut staff 2007 : first of a series of scandals as it emerges that 90 patients died from @entity93 at @entity263 and @entity265 trust – because managers were obsessed with targets			0
2009 : @entity269 scandal emerges : up to 1,200 die on filthy and short - staffed wards			0
health secretary @entity271 orders an investigation but refuses to hold a full public inquiry			0
2010 : @entity52 loses the election , spending almost £ 100billion annually on the @entity16 – almost triple the level when it took over .			0
