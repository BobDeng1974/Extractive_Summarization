the @entity11 boss made the quip at half - time during tuesday 's 2 - 0 @entity15 qualifying win over @entity16 , which was intended to convey the need for his side to play the ball more to winger @entity20			2
apology : @entity11 manager @entity2 has apologised for making a joke about a monkey during the team 's @entity15 qualifier against @entity16 on tuesday night nonplussed : @entity20 tweeted to say there was no offence meant or taken defence : @entity29 took to @entity30 to stand up for @entity2 tunnel vision : a series of video stills which show @entity20 emerging for the second half good show : @entity20 put in a good performance against @entity37 before he was substituted @entity2 is believed to have upset an unnamed player in the dressing room and the word ' monkey ' can in certain contexts have racist connotations			1
@entity44 , chairman of anti-racism campaign group @entity46 , had called on the @entity1 to investigate but the group later said if no complaint had been made following the the investigation into the comments ' then the matter can only be deemed as concluded '			1
but @entity7 said : ' @entity2 is a man of the highest integrity , an honourable man who is doing a great job with the @entity11 team			1
he has and deserves the full support of the @entity1			1
' he has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half - time on tuesday night			0
he has also explained the context in which he made his remarks			0
' he has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate , and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation			0
importantly , he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken			2
video : watch the players emerge from the tunnel at half - time clash : the joke came in a half - time team talk during the crunch game at @entity78 the joke , which is believed to have been told in full at half - time , is as follows			1
‘ @entity80 decided they would finally send a man up in an capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions			0
‘ they fire the man and the monkey into space			0
’ ‘ the intercom crackles “ fire the retros ”			0
‘ a little later , “ monkey , check the solid fuel supply ’ ‘ later still “ monkey , check the life support systems for the man ”			0
‘ the astronaut takes umbrage and radios @entity80			0
“ when do i get something ”			0
’ ‘ @entity80 replied – in 15 minutes , feed the monkey			0
’ ' @entity2 has spoken with @entity20 and a number of the players since the game and he has been assured there are no problems within the squad whatsoever			1
' additionally the @entity1 has not had a complaint from any squad member or player representative , and we have today talked extensively to the squad			1
the @entity1 has been assured by the players that there are no problems and they understand the point @entity2 was making and the context in which he was speaking			1
' we will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving @entity2 and the team our full support as we prepare for the @entity15 in @entity119			1
' @entity2 used the joke as he attempted to explain to right back @entity121 that he wanted to get the ball to @entity124 more often in the second half of the @entity15 qualifier			1
but @entity20 tweeted on thursday morning to insist that ' no offence ' had been meant by @entity2 or taken by him			1
the winger posted : ' i do n't know what all this fuss is about			0
no offence was meant and none was taken ! it 's not even news worthy ! ' goalscorer @entity29 jumped to @entity2 's defence on thursday morning , he tweeted : ' seen the story on roy this morning			1
' he added on his website : ' to be honest it 's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day , all the lads know what type of guy @entity2 is , and to try and pin a some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous			2
' @entity2 spoke to @entity20 straight away who took no offence whatsoever , hopefully that 's now the end of the matter			1
' @entity2 said on wednesday night : ‘ i would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what i said at half - time			1
‘ there was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate			0
success : the @entity11 team secured their passage to next year 's @entity15 in @entity119 by the 2 - 0 victory ‘ i made this clear straight away to @entity20 in the dressing room			2
i also spoke to @entity20 again on wednesday			2
‘ he has assured me and the @entity1 he did not take any offence and understood the point i was making in the manner i intended			1
’ @entity11 ’s manager is furious and insists it was an analogy about @entity80 sending a monkey into space and can not be interpreted in any other way			0
@entity20 's father @entity178 works for the kick it out campaign and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son			1
@entity2 is understood to be distraught by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading @entity11 to the @entity15 finals on tuesday			2
although he is known for lengthy team talks to his players at times , @entity2 ’s decision to make an attempt to tell a joke at the break does seem unusual			1
the 66 - year - old is a man of vast experience but is dealing with a much younger dressing - room in a modern climate			0
star : the remark came as @entity2 urged players to pass to up - and - coming @entity200 @entity202 boss @entity201 did not think that it was an issue , saying : ' we are a politically correct country and we have to be careful about what we say today			2
but if we continue to wipe it up and promote everything in the press , nobody will be able to say a word shortly			0
' we 'll have to keep ourselves quiet and not express opinions			0
we should n't be saying anything wrong but you have to be very careful today			0
i 'm sure with what @entity2 said he did n't mean any offence or any harm			1
' former @entity11 striker @entity219 , meanwhile , insisted the joke makes no reference to race			0
' if @entity2 has said that phrase in the dressing room then it is in the context of the story , ' he told @entity227			2
' people are walking on egg shells , worried about everything they say			0
why would the word " monkey " have a racist feel for someone in the dressing room , or any player ? i ca n’t see the link , can you ? ' we ’ve all got the right to feel offence , but this is really spurious			2
what are you actually offended by ? the word " monkey " ? i do n’t see any reference to race			0
you have to look at the big picture			0
' is @entity2 , from what we know of him over the last 30 - 40 years , the sort of man to go out of his way to be stupid enough to cause offence ? i would say no. ' relief : @entity2 celebrates at @entity6 , and is now in line for a big bonus if @entity11 do well next summer			2

an unnamed player is believed to have taken offence at the joke
chairman @entity7 says manager has full backing of the @entity1
@entity20 tweeted to say he was not offended and it was a *needless* fuss
@entity2 apologised in case there was anybody who was upset by it
