by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 14:39 est , 21 march 2012 five million of the country 's pensioners will be hit by an ' outrageous ' £ 3billion ' @entity3 ' hidden in today 's budget			1
the chancellor announced that he will phase out the higher income tax allowance enjoyed by around half the country 's pensioners , already struggling with record - low interest rates on their savings			1
from next year , people turning 65 will no longer qualify for the higher rate of £ 10,500 - a - year			1
instead , they will qualify for just a standard income tax allowance which was raised today to £ 9,205			1
the raid on @entity16 ’s pensioners , worth £ 3.3bn over the next five years represents the biggest money spinner for the @entity18 - and removes an old age tax relief that has been built into our system since 1925 - when the then chancellor @entity22 introduced it			1
@entity23 : half the country 's pensioners will lose hundreds of pounds annually when their tax allowance is reduced ( file picture ) individuals affected will pay an extra £ 260 - a - year extra in tax more than they would have done			1
the backlash against mr @entity32 ’s plans to penalise millions of pensioners was gaining force this afternoon with ‘ @entity3 ’ currently the most trending subject in the world on @entity37			0
age charities united in opposition to the measure			0
dr @entity41 , director - general , @entity42 said : ' this is an outrageous assault on decent middle - class pensioners			0
' @entity45 contains an enormous stealth tax for older people			1
over the next five years , pensioners with an income of between £ 10,000 and £ 24,000 will be paying an extra £ 3 billion in tax while richer pensioners are left unaffected			1
' there is nothing in this budget for savers , there is nothing to improve the annuity market , nothing to appease the damage of quantitative easing and nothing to support @entity63 changes and shelter older people ’s money in cash			1
this budget is terrible news for pensioners			0
' it is good to hear that we will be able to harness the power of pension funds to improve @entity16 infrastructure but in short , this budget is another shocking example of the government ’s attack on poorer and older people			0
' the @entity18 have calculated the measures will raise £ 1billion a year by 2015 rising to £ 1.25 billion by 2016			1
in total , the so - called ‘ simplification ’ measures will cost pensioners £ 3.3billion over the next five years			2
mr @entity32 insisted that no pensioners will lose out in cash terms and that the move would help simplify the system			0
congratulations : prime minister @entity92 congratulates the chancellor on his budget in which he revealed the controversial tax raid on the elderly however , @entity99 leader @entity98 said it amounted to a ‘ hidden tax ’ rise on millions of pensioners			2
chief secretary to the treasury @entity104 claimed the move would result in a ‘ fairer ’ and ‘ simpler ’ tax system			2
he insisted : ‘ there will be no cash losers			0
’ but @entity112 , general secretary of the @entity113 ’ @entity111 , said : ‘ the decision to freeze the age related personal tax allowances effectively means around five million pensioner tax payers will no longer get additional reductions in their tax over the coming years – whilst those on the top rate of tax will see their bills reduced			1
‘ many older people will feel they are being asked to forego their reduction in tax to help out the super rich			2
there ’s no fairness in that			0
’ @entity130 of accountants @entity129 said : ‘ the chancellor is allowing age allowances to wither on the vine			0
he is effectively phasing them out but there is always a price to pay for simplicity			0
’ mr @entity32 said the move to scrap age - related personal allowances was the result of a recommendation from the @entity143 which said 150,000 pensioners every year must fill out self - assessment tax returns due to the separate allowances			1
mr @entity32 also confirmed that the government will introduce a single - tier state pension above the level of means - tests at an estimated £ 140			2
the new system will be introduced ' early in the next @entity152 ' with final decisions to be made by the next spending review			0
the new system will provide a flat level of support , which is greater than the amount people currently receive through the basic state pension and means - tested pension credit			2
it will still be based on contributions and will not cost more than the current system			0
the reforms will not apply to today 's pensioners and are likely to take years to come into effect			0
@entity168 general secretary @entity167 said : ' the chancellor 's decision to raise more than £ 1 billion extra in tax from pensioners by freezing age allowances will come back to haunt him			1
it 's already being dubbed " the granny tax "			2
' pretending that pensioners will be grateful because it will simplify their tax is a vain hope			0
instead they will see that they are being asked to pay more while the super-rich have kept all the pensions tax relief - a heavy burden for ordinary taxpayers			1
' and with ever more increases in the state pension age threatened in a new @entity188 - a burden that falls more heavily on the poor , the regions and those with manual jobs - older workers and pensioners are paying a heavy price for a pro-rich budget			0

higher income tax allowance of five million elderly people to be phased out
move will reduce allowance from £ 10,500 to £ 9,205
' @entity204 ' is the @entity205 's biggest money - spinner for the @entity18
removes an old age tax relief that was first introduced by @entity22 in 1925
