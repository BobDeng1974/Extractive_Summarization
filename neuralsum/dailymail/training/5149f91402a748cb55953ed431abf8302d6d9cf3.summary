@entity1 's grape growers say they are expecting one of the earliest harvests seen to date - and it 's all because of the weather			1
although the state enjoys a balmy climate all year round , this year 's unexpectedly dry @entity6 has hastened the arrival of this year 's crop			0
what 's more , say wine experts , the unseasonably early harvest could result in vintages that are ' bolder ' and stronger than usual			2
rapidly ripening : these syrah grapes are turning from green to purple with harvest now just three weeks away the white stuff : for growers of white and champagne grapes , harvest has already begun @entity22 : despite the early crop , the taste of the resulting wines wo n't be affected farmers usually have to wait until august for the first signs of ripening but say grapes are already turning purple and expect to gather in the fruit three weeks early			1
according to @entity32 , the owner of @entity33 in @entity34 , the sight of swiftly purpling fruit marks the start of a three week countdown to harvest			2
' it 's all due to the weather , ' he revealed in an interview with @entity43			0
' the dry spring kick started the grape growing season			0
' although an early harvest is n't entirely without precedent , it happens on average once every 10 years , with the last recorded in 2009 according to growers			1
but while the red wine grapes still have another few weeks to go , the white grapes are ready now according to champagne grape growers , who say they will start bringing in the crop next week			1
happily for @entity1 wine lovers , the unusually early harvest wo n't have an impact on the taste of the eventual wine			0
' if we have an earlier harvest , for the north coast , it 's a good thing because this is a cooler climate area , ' added @entity32			0
' if we can get the grapes in sooner then we 're not backed up into late october and early november and that 's when bad things happen			2

@entity69 and other red grape *varieties* are ripening three weeks early
early harvests happen , on average , once every 10 years
@entity34 growers will begin *picking* white grapes next week
