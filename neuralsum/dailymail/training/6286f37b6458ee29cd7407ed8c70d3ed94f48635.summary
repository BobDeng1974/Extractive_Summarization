the @entity0 said today it would be ' difficult or impossible ' for convicted rapist @entity2 to play football abroad due to the terms of his licence he has denied his guilt and failed to apologise to the teenage girl he is convicted of raping in a hotel room since being released from prison , with his long - term partner claiming all he wants to do is return to football			1
but rapist @entity2 ' may never play professionally again , with terms of his sex offender 's licence rendering it near impossible for him to work abroad , the @entity0 said today			1
it comes after the 25 - year - old 's former club , @entity19 , revoked his invitation to train on their grounds this week			1
no other @entity24 clubs have expressed interest in signing the criminal since his early release from @entity29 on october 17 despite the @entity30 saying yesterday it hoped he would be made an offer			1
rumours swirled @entity2 may have been picked up by the @entity33 after its lawyer wrote an online article claiming he could be innocent			2
however it was said today it would be ' difficult or impossible ' for a sex offender to meet the terms of their licence while working abroad			1
' we do not comment on individual prisoners			0
' in general terms , a sex offender on licence would have to have regular meetings with their offender manager and that is difficult or impossible to do if they are living abroad , ' a spokesman told @entity51 this morning			1
@entity2 , who plans to appeal his 2012 conviction for raping a teenage waitress in a hotel in @entity55 , @entity56 , served just half of the five - year sentence he handed			1
the remainder of the sentence will be completed on licence , meaning he must regularly check in with an offender manager until 2016			1
by the time he has completed his entire sentence , he will be 27 , and will remain on the @entity64 for life			0
following his release last month , pressure mounted on @entity19 not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds			1
a string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue , with olympian @entity76 vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at @entity80 should he be reinstated			0
after failing to take a public stance for days , the club revealed @entity2 would be allowed to train with former teammates but did not invite him to return permanently			1
their invitation was revoked this week after mass public outcry			2
in a statement , the club said the public reaction to their actions could not have been ' anticipated '			2
' @entity91 initially accepted a request from the @entity30 for @entity2 to be able to train			1
the reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced			0
the athlete , who used to play for @entity19 ( right ) , had his invitation to train at the club revoked following mass public outcry the former footballer , pictured with his long - term girlfriend @entity101 , has protested his innocence despite being convicted of raping a teenage girl in 2011 ' the club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms			1
' the @entity30 accepted the club 's decision , but added it hoped @entity2 would be given a job elsewhere			1
' it may ultimately be of benefit to both parties to move on and for @entity2 to look for a fresh start at a different club			1
' it is hoped that @entity119 will be given an opportunity at another club to return to the job he is trained to do , ' a statement released yesterday read			0
@entity19 co-chairman @entity122 argued condemned the decision as unfair , saying he was ' angry ' @entity2 was n't given a second chance			1
‘ i ’m angry we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done , ’ said @entity122			0
‘ i ’m upset that we are not able to do what we wanted to do , but i acknowledge that my view is not the only view			0
my principles and the board ’s principles are not the only thing that matter			0
‘ the influence of mob - like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing @entity2 to train			1
' earlier this week , the @entity33 's lawyer wrote an online article claiming the former player could be innocent			0
likening the situation to that of the @entity146 , who had their convictions over the @entity149 quashed following a lengthy public campaign , @entity143 wrote : ' this crime , as alleged , was at the bottom end			0

this , i hasten to add , does not make it right , or anything close to it , but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor			0
' it has since been removed from @entity30 @entity186 's website			0
last month @entity161 resigned as a patron of @entity19 : ' it influences the next generation and i do n’t believe it is sending out the right message to employ a convicted rapist			1

not in my name , not in my community and not in my club			0
