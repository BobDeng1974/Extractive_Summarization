by @entity0 invasive foreign animals and plants such as oak processionary moths , @entity7 knotweed and killer shrimp are a spiralling problem that the government is failing to deal with , a panel of @entity2 has found			1
ten new alien species are arriving in @entity12 each year and many cause catastrophic problems , according to @entity16 ’s green watchdog			1
the @entity17 today publishes a report on the problem , which is costing the economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year			1
the worst foreign intruders that are causing ' catastrophic ' problems for he government to deal with some 1,875 non-native species were counted in the @entity12 in 2012 , of which 282 had become ‘ invasive ’ , the report found			1
newcomers including @entity27 signal crayfish , killer shrimp and zebra mussels are having a huge impact on native species , as well as human health and business , the @entity2 said			2
@entity34 , the committee ’s chairman , said there are more non-native species than ever before			0
@entity7 knotweed is causing damage costing £ 165million to tackle she said : ‘ not all of these species will become “ invasive ” , but the ones that do can harm native wildlife , clog up our waterways , cause costly problems for homeowners and sometimes even harm human health			1
' it is too expensive to control or eradicate all invasive species , so we have to be smart and pick fights we know we can win			2
we may just have to live with grey squirrels and rhododendrons in much of the @entity12 , but we can and must control other invasive species – like the killer shrimp devastating eco-systems in rivers and lakes			1
’ the committee is calling for a change in the law that would give the government new powers to eradicate invasive species before they become established			0
the oak processionary moth , left , and killer shrimp , right , are among those species having a huge impact on speices native to @entity12 the @entity71 prohibits releasing non-native species to the wild , but no one has been prosecuted under the law			1
the mps believe that ministers should follow the example set by @entity80 ’s government , which has passed laws allowing environment officers to enter any land where they suspect invasive species are creating a problem			0
some non-native animals have caused profound change , such as the replacement of red squirrels by grey squirrels in most of @entity12			2
@entity90 squirrels do £ 10million of damage to trees a year , the report found , while it costs £ 165million a year to battle @entity7 knotweed			1
the @entity95 estimates invasive species cost @entity97 countries £ 10billion a year , while it cost £ 11million to clear just one national park in @entity99 of invasive rhododendron			2
some species also affect health			0
giant hogweed has given anglers skin inflammations , while common ragweed pollen causes asthma			0
the @entity109 hornet , yet to enter @entity12 , has killed six people in @entity111			0
@entity112 , of the @entity113 , said : ‘ continued targeted management of invasive species such as rhododendron and grey squirrels must be supported at government level			0
’ the invaders can damage ancient woods and carry disease , he said			0
‘ to leave them unchecked in the long term would be a real failure to safeguard our natural heritage			0
