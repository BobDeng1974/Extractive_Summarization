the foreign secretary claimed chemical weapons have been used in @entity10 and said @entity3 and @entity4 want to be able to ‘ take urgent action ’ in the event of future atrocities			1
he announced that @entity3 will supply 34 vehicles , including five armoured 4x4s , and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator @entity20			1
mr @entity2 revealed that he will press the case for an end to the @entity9 arms embargo in talks with foreign counterparts in @entity26 on saturday			1
he said no final decision to arm the rebels has been taken , but stressed that @entity10 moderates lack weapons that are easily obtainable by the regime and @entity33 extremists			1
the foreign secretary told @entity35 : ‘ the use of chemical weapons in @entity10 would demand a serious international response			1
' the @entity3 is increasingly concerned that there is evidence of the use of chemical weapons in @entity10			2
our policy on @entity10 can not be static in the face of this growing calamity			2
’ he added : ‘ we have taken no decision that we would like to send arms to the @entity10 opposition but the @entity3 and @entity4 argue that we will need further amendments to the @entity9 arms embargo or even to lift it			2
‘ we need greater flexibility if we decide that urgent action is necessary , for example in response to a specific incident or continued grave deterioration on the ground			2
’ desolate : a man walks along a damaged street filled with debris in @entity64 yesterday , which has seen heavy fighting in recent months government sources say the @entity3 and @entity4 want the embargo lifted to help persuade @entity68 to stop arming the @entity20 regime			1
under @entity9 law , the embargo has to be adopted by all 27 member nations at the end of may or it will lapse			0
a senior source said : ‘ we want it rewritten or scrapped			0
the @entity4 are with us			0
the hope is that that will focus minds in @entity79			0
’ @entity80 is already spearheading efforts to arm the rebels using weapons paid for by @entity84			1
mr @entity2 ’s words will fuel concerns that @entity3 risks being sucked into a civil war which has left more than 70,000 dead and which shows little sign of abating			0
ruthless campaign : @entity10 policemen performing during a live - fire military exercise			0
a @entity10 human rights group today said a key military unit loyal to president @entity20 is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents under attack : a member of the @entity99 runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to @entity10 's president @entity20 , in @entity64 yesterday critics have warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by @entity33 supporters			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ there are legitimate arguments against [ arming @entity10 rebels ]			2
if we were to take that step we would have to assure ourselves to the maximum degree , not only of the legal position but that they could not be misused by other people for whom they were not intended			0
’ but he added : ‘ it must also be a major consideration that a regime that is not bringing the conflict to an end can get weapons , that extremists can get weapons , but that people that are in favour of a free and democratic @entity10 find it very difficult to do so			0
’ in addition to the armoured vehicles , @entity3 will also deliver eight trucks , six suvs , five pick - ups , a recovery vehicle and four forklifts to the rebels			2
the equipment is part of a non-lethal package worth less than £ 3million that also includes 107 generators , 130 solar - powered batteries and civil resilience kits			0
mr @entity2 faced criticism from his own side			0
@entity143 mp dr @entity142 said that if the @entity20 regime fell , the government could not guarantee that chemical weapons would not fall into the hands of extremist fighters in @entity10			1
