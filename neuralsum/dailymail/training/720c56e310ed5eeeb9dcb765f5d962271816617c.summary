by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 5 may 2013 when @entity2 found out his son - in - law was set to pick up an @entity5 purchase from the home where he was raised by his own parents , he was intrigued enough to go along for the ride			1
but the grandfather 's curiosity turned to astonishment when the bungalow 's owner , after learning of his history in the house , handed him a bracelet his late mother @entity18 had lost decades earlier			1
the 66 - year - old grandfather - of - six admitted he was overwhelmed to be presented with the silver trinket stamped with his mother 's initials - that he did n't even know she had lost			1
what are the chances ? @entity2 , 66 , holds up the silver bracelet which belonged to his mother that he was reunited with after a chance encounter with the new owner of his childhood home mr @entity2 's parents lived at the bungalow in @entity35 , @entity36 , which was built by his grandfather , after they got married in 1936 until they sold it and moved to @entity39 in 1985			1
' it 's overwhelming to be honest , ' mr @entity2 said			2
' the owners held up a bracelet which they said they found while they were gardening outside the bedroom window			0
' the bracelet had the initials er on it			0
my mother 's maiden name was @entity50 and her first name was @entity18			2
' i must admit i did n't even know mum had the bracelet , let alone lost it , until i was shown it			2
' blast from the past : mr @entity2 's mother @entity18 , centre , to whom the bracelet belonged , with his father @entity61 , left , and sister @entity62 , right , pictured in the garden of the home in @entity35 , @entity36 how it looked then : mr @entity2 's parents lived at the bungalow , which was built by his grandfather , after they got married in 1936 , raised there children there and remained until they sold it and moved to @entity39 in 1985 mr @entity2 grew up at the property with his two sisters and lived there until he got married when he was 28 - years - old			1
so he was already stunned when his son - in - law @entity74 told him that he had to visit the property to pick up a sofa that he 'd bid for an the auction site @entity5			1
and the retired computer worker had another shock when the owner of the bungalow gave him a silver bracelet which his mother had lost			1
' i think it must be her engagement bracelet because there 's a shape of a heart on it , ' he added			2
' @entity90 must have lost the bracelet when i was very young , probably while she was gardening			0
' we 'll keep it			0
it 's of more sentimental value than monetary value			0
' heirloom : mr @entity2 says he 'll keep the bracelet , which he thinks must have been given to his mother as an engagement present because it has a heart on it the bracelet 's finder @entity104 , who has since moved out of the bungalow , said she was delighted she was able to reunite the jewellery with its owner			1
she said : ' i dug it up while i was making a flower bed and i kept it because i thought it was rather sweet			0
' i had a lump in my throat when i gave him the bracelet			0
it 's now back with its rightful owners			0

@entity2 , 66 , was already stunned when son - in - law told him he was set to pick up purchase from his childhood home
but he got another shock when the bungalow 's owner presented him with a bracelet his mother lost decades earlier
he says he will keep the silver trinket , which he believes was an engagement present to his mother
