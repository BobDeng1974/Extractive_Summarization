the home that inspired one of the most famous paintings in @entity4 history could soon be in search of a tenant			1
if you 're keen on living the quiet life in @entity10 , @entity11 ( pop. 900 ) and have around just $ 250 per month , the house featured in @entity14 's 1930 masterpiece @entity15 could be the home for you			1
the pitchfork , however , wo n't be included			0
look familiar ? the house that played backdrop to @entity14 's 1930 masterpiece @entity15 is now without a tenant as of monday @entity4 favorite : the somehow equally stoic , comical and unsettling painting has become one of the most parodied works of art of all time isolated : the house is in @entity10 , @entity11 , a town of 900 in fact , the @entity29 has yet to decide if they intend to again rent out the 700 - square - foot 1882 home after tenant of four years @entity33 moved out			1
' there should be a statute of limitations for how long one can live in a tourist attraction , ' she joked to the @entity39 tuesday			0
monday marked @entity33 's last day in the house			1
. and who knows , you may gain artistic inspiration from the home , as @entity14 did and as @entity45 did thereafter			1
@entity14 was an @entity11 painter who spotted the house while traveling through the area			1
he used it as the backdrop to his 1930 painting of a farmer holding a pitchfork next to his daughter			0
the man was actually @entity14 's dentist and the ' wife ' the artist 's sister @entity55			2
and while not entirely non-fiction , the comically unsettling portrait is perhaps @entity4 's most parodied ever			2
so much so that the house that simply stands in its background has become a tourist attraction			2
at least initially , that did n't bother @entity45			0
she liked the rent , kept artificially low to make up for the nuisance rubberneckers , and wanted a place to start anew after becoming a widow at age 48			0
she was inspired and then some , becoming known as the ' @entity68 ' for the impressive pastries she churned out in the historic home 's kitchen			1
she also started a popular pie blog			0
the tourist attraction is also a home : a woman named @entity33 lived for fours years in the house , but moved out monday just a regular home ... almost : @entity45 had to keep the windows covered nearly all the time to avoid peeping - tom tourists pie lady : @entity45 cooked thousands of pies in the famous home 's kitchen and made a name for herself , and even wrote a bestselling cookbook , while living there homey : @entity45 managed to make a name for herself as a pie maker , cookbook author and public speaker while she lived in the 1882 home she also wrote a bestselling cookbook while in the home			1
but she 's now gone off to greener pastures , a room with a view of cows in an equally rural part of the state , to write a book she says will be ' a memoir of the misadventures of living in a masterpiece painting with snakes in the basement			2
' meanwhile , @entity110 , the society 's historic site administrator , said the group is weighing its options on what to do next			0
they may rent it out again or they may offer an artist - in - residence program			0
they may also allow the next - door visitors ' center , which is run by the city and county , to use it			0
@entity124 : @entity45 ( with the pitchfork ) moved into the home after becoming widowed at 48			0
she lived there four years and has now moved to a friend 's farm , where she hopes to write a book about her time at the house			1

the @entity11 house that inspired one of the world 's most *recognizable* paintings rented for just $ 250 per month
@entity33 first rented the little home in @entity10 four years *ago* but had to deal with a lot of nosy tourists
the @entity29 could has not decided if they *'ll* seek a new renter
