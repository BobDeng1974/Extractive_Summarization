the strain placed on the @entity1 by patients from abroad is revealed by figures showing that around half a million immigrants sign up at gp surgeries every year			1
the startling finding has come from independent research because the government has failed to look into the impact of immigration on the health system			2
adding to the demand on the @entity1 , many gp surgeries lead new arrivals to believe that all health care is free – even though temporary migrants should pay for expensive hospital care , unless it is an emergency			1
but with more patients sometimes waiting weeks for an appointment with their gp , the issue has begun to move up the political agenda			2
on thursday , @entity33 chief whip @entity32 became the latest politician to voice concerns			2
he told the @entity38 ’s @entity37 audience that ‘ the rate and pace of immigration ’ was creating particular pressures , including those ‘ on access to gps and hospitals ’			2
experts do not know how many immigrants registering at @entity42 come from within the @entity49 , but it is estimated they account for about 40 per cent , or 200,000 each year			1
despite growing worries , the @entity51 has not carried out a single study into the impact of a decade ’s worth of mass immigration on use of the @entity1			0
it has only researched the sensitive issue of ‘ health tourism ’			0
however , analysis by the highly respected @entity64 think - tank has found immigration is leading to about half a million joining gps ’ books every year			1
researchers @entity68 and @entity69 looked at the number of people aged 16 and over registering with a gp for the first time			0
mr @entity68 said : ‘ the method is not perfect , but we identified 550,000 probable immigrants registering in the year 2003 - 04			1
this rose to 583,000 for 2004 - 05 and to 625,000 for 2005 - 06			0
’ in the absence of @entity80 research , the @entity64 ’s estimates are the most recent figures available			0
however , since immigration has remained high , the pressure is continuing to grow on gp surgeries			1
in the year to june 2014 , 583,000 people came to live and work in the @entity87 , according to the @entity88 , and 325,000 left			1
separate figures show that the average length of @entity22 patient lists has increased in 198 of 211 health authority areas across @entity93 since april 2013			1
dr @entity94 , a member of the @entity96 ’s @entity95 , said that although doctors were concerned about being overwhelmed , the pressure was not down to immigrants , but the ageing population			1
he said : ‘ they [ @entity42 ] say they are struggling , but it ’s not because of changes in the population			0
’ dr @entity94 added that immigrants tended to be younger and healthier than the general population , elderly people used the @entity1 far more and @entity42 were having to carry out more work traditionally done in hospitals			2
however , he said migrants with poor @entity93 did tend to need longer consultations and also the use of interpreters			2
last year 42,500 women from @entity117 gave birth in @entity1 hospitals , new figures have revealed births to women from @entity117 countries in the @entity49 have leapt tenfold over the past decade at @entity1 hospitals			1
in 2004 , there were about 4,500 births in @entity93 and @entity125 to women from @entity127 and other former @entity129 nations that are now members of the @entity49			1
but by 2013 that figure had risen to 42,500 , according to the @entity88			0
@entity127 women account for about half of these births , with their number rising from 1,830 a decade ago to 21,275 in 2013			0
the @entity88 regards ‘ new @entity49 countries ’ as those that have joined the @entity49 since the start of 2004 – @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity127 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			1
@entity147 and @entity148 joined in 2007 , and @entity149 in 2013			0
with the average hospital delivery costing around £ 1,500 , the @entity1 ’s total maternity bill may have risen by around £ 57 million due to immigration from these ‘ new @entity49 ’ countries			1
women from these countries used to account for a tiny proportion of births in @entity93 and @entity125 overall – just 0.7 per cent in 2004			0
by 2013 that had grown to 6.1 per cent			0
over a similar period , the ratio of @entity87 births to all foreign - born mothers rose from 19.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent – up from 124,563 in 2004 to 189,075 in 2012			0
births to @entity87 - born women numbered 515,144 in 2004 and 540,572 in 2012			0
the rises have left maternity units struggling , with the @entity165 demanding 3,200 more midwives .			0

many surgeries are leading new arrivals to believe that all care is free
this is despite the fact migrants should pay for expensive *treatment*
around *500,000* immigrants are signing up with @entity22 surgeries every year
experts believe that 200,000 of those signing up are from within the @entity49
