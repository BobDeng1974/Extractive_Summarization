high - resolution images taken by the @entity2 probe during a @entity4 flyby reveal comet @entity5 in unprecedented detail			1
the images reveal boulders on the comet 's surface , as well as ' stunning details of the contrasting terrain , ' the @entity7 said			1
the boulders in these images range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres , and lay scattered across the comet 's surface			1
this image set was taken at 10:32 gmt from a distance of 7.8 miles ( 12.6 km ) from the comet centre			0
using the surface distance , the image scale is 0.9 m / pixel to take the images , @entity2 passed within just four miles ( 6 km ) of the surface of the comet in the first dedicated close flyby of the mission			1
the sun was directly behind @entity2 as the pictures were taken , providing optimal light conditions			1
the closest approach took place at 12:41 gmt over the @entity41 region on the comet 's large lobe			2
@entity2 's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet 's small lobe at the top of the image , with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set			1

to take the images , @entity2 passed within just four miles ( 6 km ) of the surface of the comet in the first dedicated close flyby @entity7 's @entity2 spacecraft launched on 2 march 2004 aboard an ariane 5 rocket , on a mission to visit comet @entity5			1
it took more than ten years to reach the comet , and on the way it flew past @entity74 and two asteroids			0
on 6 august 2014 it entered orbit around the comet , beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible			0
on 12 november 2014 @entity2 successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called @entity83			2
this small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest			0
although @entity83 's landing did not go as planned , it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died , sending the probe to sleep			2
the location of the lander is currently unknown			0
it is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but , as the comet approaches the sun , the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , is continuing its mission around the comet			1
@entity108 is approaching the sun and , by august this year , it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased			0
this will release much more ice , vapour and other materials from the surface - and @entity2 will be there to watch it all happen			2
as well as providing the opportunity to take close - up high - resolution images of the comet surface , flybys like this also allow @entity2 's instruments to sample the innermost parts of the comet 's atmosphere , or coma			1
@entity2 is now moving out for a far view of the comet â€“ it will reach a distance of about 160 miles ( 255km ) from the comet centre tomorrow			2
earlier this week , @entity132 said the structure of @entity134 resembles ice cream			0
in an experiment , they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard , outer crust , the interior would mostly be fluffy ice			0
@entity2 's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet 's small lobe at the top of the image , with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set ' a comet is like deep fried ice cream , ' said dr @entity154 of @entity132 's @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 , corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the @entity160			1
' the crust is made of crystalline ice , while the interior is colder and more porous			0
the organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top			0
' to come to the conclusion , astronomers used an icebox - like instrument nicknamed @entity171			0
they showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up			0
the composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young , hot @entity182			0
new results from the @entity2 mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life 's ingredients ; however , the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role			1

this image set was taken at 4:32 gmt from a distance of 22 miles ( 35km )			0

@entity200 's *day* *swoop* was the first dedicated close flyby of the mission
imaged boulders range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres
the sun was directly behind @entity2 , providing optimal light conditions
