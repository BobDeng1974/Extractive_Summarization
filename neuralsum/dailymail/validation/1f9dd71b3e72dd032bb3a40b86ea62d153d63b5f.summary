if you 're on a diet , look away now			0
there 's a global obsession with fast food , which shows no signs of slowing down			1
with extra cheese , extra bacon and extra portions , these calorific dishes are among the most unhealthy in the world			1
@entity11 investigates the top ten most heart - stopping , artery - squeezing burgers			0
@entity15 's @entity14 is topped with cheese , honey mustard and relish dressing 1			1
@entity15 caused a stir with the introduction of its heart - stopping @entity14 - a traditional hot dog that opts for a not so traditional fillet of fried chicken rather than a bun			0
the ' dog ' is then smothered in cheese sauce , honey mustard and relish dressing			1
@entity29 : it was only available over a two - day period in the @entity31			0
@entity32 : 540 calories 2			0
@entity35 's @entity34 is compiled of three flame - grilled beef patties , cheddar cheese and chili cheese sauce 2			1
@entity35 is offering up not one , not two , but three beef patties in @entity35 's @entity41			2
the sub is then topped up with cheddar cheese slices , chili cheese sauce and fiery jalapenos			2
let 's not forget , the ' x-tra ' is extra indeed ; the sandwich is supposedly 17.5cm in length , which is 4.8cm longer than the chain 's largest burger			2
@entity29 : @entity52 and @entity53			1
@entity35 's fondue burger is composed of cheddar , mozzarella , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and even a splash of white wine the fondue sauce comes by itself , or with the @entity64 ( right ) or the @entity65 ( left ) 3			1
forget ketchup or mayonnaise , @entity35 's @entity66 is definitely one of the more bizarre burger concoctions , combining an @entity71 favourite with the @entity73 delicacy			1
the sauce supposedly includes cheddar , mozzarella , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and even a splash of white wine			0
it 's available by itself or with the @entity35 beef or chicken burger			2
@entity29 : @entity82 @entity32 : 782 calories			0
@entity85 's @entity84 includes a layer of bacon with grilled pork sausage curled on top , topped with cheese , all resting on top of a rösti - the @entity95 version of hash browns			1
just as terrifying as it sounds , @entity85 's @entity97 has a double meat combo of a sausage made from 100 per cent pork , laid on top of strips of crispy bacon			2
all of this is nestled on top of a rösti - the @entity95 version of hash browns - and topped up with grilled onions and a spicy mustard sauce			0
@entity29 : @entity95 @entity32 : unknown 5			0
@entity15 's @entity110 is comprised of a beef patty , bacon , cheese sauce and barbecue sauce sandwiched between two slabs of fried chicken ' no bun , all meat ' : the advertising slogan of @entity15 's @entity110 says it all , as the sandwich forgoes any sort of bread bun 5			1
a variation on @entity15 's aforementioned @entity14 is its @entity126 burger cousin , the @entity110			1
in a similar manner to the ' dog ' , the bun is omitted in place of two fried chicken patties			0
thrown in for good measure with the beef patty is cheese , bacon , barbecue sauce and the @entity138 's ' special sauce ' @entity29 : @entity126			1
@entity35 's @entity140 offers up @entity73 fries , gravy , cheese curds , chopped beef , mustard , ketchup and pickles as the advertising headline indicates , @entity35 's @entity148 is only available in @entity150			1
not quite a burger , but bosses at fast - food chain @entity35 have certainly outdone themselves with their @entity140			0
a ' poutine ' is traditionally a @entity150 dish composed of french fries , gravy and cheese curds			1
@entity35 's ' whopper ' offers the dense additions of chopped beef , mustard , ketchup and pickles			2
the fast food chain also serves up less monstrous versions of the ' whopper ' such as the @entity168 , @entity148 with @entity169 and the @entity170 with jalapeños and onions			0
@entity32 : 880 calories ... and 1490mg of sodium and 70mg of cholesterol			0
@entity85 's @entity176 has layers of lettuce , bacon , two beef patties and a seasoned mash potato dolloped on top 7			1
definitely the strangest of them all , is @entity85 's @entity176			2
the concoction includes salad , two ' 100 per cent beef ' patties , bacon , laden with a seasoned mash potato topping - all sandwiched between two buns			2
even more surprising is the staggering low price for the hulk of food : @entity197 which tallies up at about £ 2.11			0
@entity200 's @entity199 is filled with bacon , cheese , ' @entity203 ' , salsa and lettuce 8			1
the @entity71 restaurant chain @entity200 has served up quite the beastly hybrid with their signature @entity199			0
a stacked bacon cheeseburger with ' @entity203 ' , salsa and shredded lettuce			0
@entity85 's @entity213 is a variation on the @entity215 , where one of the beef patties are substituted for egg and layers of bacon are thrown in for good measure 9			2
if the name of a burger has the word ' mega ' in it , it 's probably indicative of the proportions ... which are terrifyingly huge in @entity85 's @entity213			0
three whole beef patties , a layer of egg , a layer of bacon , cheese slices , lettuce and an array of @entity85 's sauces - all impossibly stacked between two buns			1
@entity32 : more than 1,000 calories			0
@entity238 's @entity237 contains two thick beef patties topped with slices of melted cheese , four bacon rashers and barbecue sauce , sandwiched between two glazed ring donuts 10			1
call the doctor ! the final calorific offering on the list is a sweet - meets - savoury beast from @entity238 - a chain of pub - restaurants			0
two large hunks of beef , separated with melted cheese slices , add in four strips of bacon , smother the whole thing with barbecue sauce and then cram the lot between two glazed ring donuts			1
@entity29 : @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 @entity32 : 1,996 calories .			0
