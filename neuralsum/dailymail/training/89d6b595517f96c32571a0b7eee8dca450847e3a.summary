in fact it was some of those investigators who gave @entity14 up , providing the documents to the website known for seeding the internet with groundbreaking papers exposing details of court cases that embarass celebrities			0
@entity14 has been part of president @entity10 's inner circle since his days as an @entity37 state legislator -- long before the wayward reverend defended his friend nightly on @entity40 @entity41 ( c ) was a @entity43 boss who pretended to be mentally ill in order to escape responsibility for his crimes -- but @entity14 helped foil his plot when he taped other mob figures discussing the ruse checkered past : a more hirsute @entity14 ( in blue track suit , c ) advised the rape - hoaxer @entity54 in 1998 and led marches on her behalf before her claims were unmasked as a fraud ' [ @entity60 ] ne gambino crime family figure became so comfortable with the protest leader that he spoke openly – during ten wired face - to - face meetings – about a wide range of mob business , ' @entity16 reported monday			1
that included everything ' from shylocking and extortions to death threats and the sanity of @entity70 , the @entity5 boss who long feigned mental illness in a bid to deflect law enforcement scrutiny			0
' as the mafioso expounded on these topics , @entity14 ’s briefcase -- a specially customized @entity76 model – recorded his every word			0
' @entity14 denied his law enforcement ties on saturday when @entity16 asked him point - blank about it			2
he claimed his only link with the @entity2 was related to drug dealing cases in minority communities and recording industry efforts to cheat black artists in the recording industry			2
but when asked whether he recorded his conversations with a @entity6 mob family member , he would only say , ' i 'm not saying yes , i ’m not saying no. ' veteran investigators who tracked genovese crime family members for a living told @entity16 that @entity14 , now 59 , brought a specially - equipped @entity76 briefcase to meetings with that mobster , recording the conversations and later handing the tapes over to the feds			1

he brought his girlfriend , a woman barely half his age			0
@entity131 died in 2005 while serving a 12 year prison sentence after finally admitting he was n't insane			0
this mug shot dates from 1960 , when he was convicted at age 32 of helping mob boss @entity136 run a narcotics ring rev. @entity14 , president of the @entity13 , commands the attention of leaders like @entity141 mayor @entity140 ( center r ) and police commissioner @entity143 ( c ) , perhaps because he has helped the city make cases against mob bosses but court affidavits and other papers @entity16 published on monday indicate that he also provided information to federal investigators that helped them persuade judges to authorize phone tapping and audio bugs at two @entity43 ' social clubs , ' including @entity70 ’s headquarters in @entity141 's @entity157			1
they also put bugs in three cars and more than a dozen phone lines , largely because of information @entity14 provided , yielding information used in a major racketeering case against the @entity165			0
one such case targeted @entity167 , a @entity169 soldier was drew a 20 years in prison sentence for racketeering ; recordings made because of information @entity14 provided were played in open court			1

' @entity177 , ' he laughed : ' he cleaned up his life and you want to ruin him			0
' the @entity180 claimed monday that @entity14 became an @entity2 informant after he was ' flipped ' – meaning that he was promised special legal treatment - perhaps immunity from prosecution - in exchange for his cooperation			1

' president @entity10 spoke at the 20th anniversary @entity197 on april 6 , 2011 , and plans to return this week for a repeat performance golden boy : @entity14 has been untouchable despite his group 's tax debts and his $ 888,000 in personal debts related to a failed 2004 presidential campaign the @entity204 did not respond to a question about whether the president will keep his speaking engagement at the @entity13			1
that group also did not respond to a request for comment			0
@entity14 claimed in his 2013 book ' @entity212 ' that he never informed for the government , saying that any attempt to paint him as a snitch was a ploy to squelch his loud voice in the civil rights movement			1
he was once ' set up by the government , ' he said , when agents leaked ' false information ' that ' could have gotten me killed			0
