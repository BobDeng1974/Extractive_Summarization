by @entity0 @entity1 has claimed a victory over its thriving budget rival @entity3 by getting a tv ad , which claimed to offer savings of £ 45 a week , banned			1
@entity1 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 ’s are under fierce pressure because millions have switched to the likes of @entity3 and @entity12 during the cost of living squeeze			2
the big four have lost billions in sales to their budget rivals , which have mounted aggressive campaigns to target middle income families			2
@entity3 's ' @entity20 ' advert featured a mum who said she saved £ 45 a week by switching from her usual supermarket now , they are fighting back with price cuts of their own and attempts to undermine the discount claims of @entity3			1
@entity28 to @entity3 ’s attack has been its ‘ @entity20 ’ campaign , boasting that families can make significant cuts to the cost of the weekly groceries by switching away from big brands and big supermarkets			1
but the campaign has been seriously undermined following a complaint from @entity1 , which has today been upheld by the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			2
the commercial , which ran in september and october last year , featured a real mum called @entity41 who had shopped at her usual store for four weeks and then switched to @entity3 , apparently saving £ 45 a week			1
she said : ‘ i was very pleasantly surprised at the variety - the fresh food , the meat , the fruit and veg - it ’s cheap and it ’s good			0
@entity1 complained that the shopper in the @entity3 advert bought different products and prices were based on 2013 and so could be out - of - date ‘ i think £ 45 a week is a lot of money given that we ’ve got to spread it so thinly amongst so many things			1
so it ’s definitely worth doing for us			0
meaning that we can go on an extra holiday a year			0
’ the commercial was pre-vetted by a body called @entity63 , which is owned by the commercial broadcasters and advises companies on tv marketing rules			0
however , @entity1 made five complaints , all of which have been upheld by the advertising watchdog			0
it pointed out that the family used in the commercial did not buy the same items when shopping at the two supermarkets , which meant it was not a fair comparison			0
the survey did not include all the comparable items bought at the two stores and so could give @entity3 an unfair advantage , while the figures behind the claimed saving of £ 45 were not clear			1
@entity1 pointed out that the price comparisons were made in the april to may period of 2013 and therefore may not have still been relevant when the commercial appeared			2
it also complained it would be wrong to imply that a shopper could always save £ 45 a week			1
despite a watchdog finding the advert was ' misleading ' , @entity3 insists the ' overall message remains true ' the @entity38 said the lack of specific information in the commercial ‘ created a misleading impression of the overall benefit to viewers of shopping at the advertiser ’s stores rather than those of their competitors ’			1
in its defence , @entity3 insisted the commercial never claimed specific savings on a product by product basis , but rather pointed out how real families could make a saving on their total weekly shop			2
@entity1 promotes itself as the cheapest of the mainstream supermarkets			0
as a result it is particularly sensitive to the price cut claims of @entity3 , which is quickly moving into the big league with sales growing at more than 30per cent a year			0
a recent @entity112 survey on a small basket of 17 comparable items found @entity3 was around £ 5 cheaper than @entity1			1
@entity3 said it was ‘ wholly disappointed ’ by the @entity38 ’s decision			0
it said : ‘ the @entity20 adverts are based on the actual savings of shoppers and the overall advertising message remains true			1
‘ it is no surprise that other supermarkets are trying to find issue with our campaign as we continue to impress shoppers with both the price and quality of what we sell			0
‘ we are confident that @entity3 offers some of the best value and lowest prices in the @entity132 , and that we do this every day as opposed to during promotional periods that you may find in other supermarkets			0

intense competition between big four supermarkets and budget rivals
