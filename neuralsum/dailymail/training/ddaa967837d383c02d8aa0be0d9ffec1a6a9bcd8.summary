background noise from the tv is a common sound in many households , but a new study suggests it might damage more than just the electricity bill			0
@entity7 researchers have found that the drone of a tv can adversely affect toddlers ’ language development			1
they say it has long been known children develop their language skills from listening to their parents - and parents speak to their children less when the tv is on			1
previous research has found that leaving the tv on in the background could harm a toddler 's language development for the study , published in the @entity22 , parents of toddlers aged 12 , 24 , and 36 months were observed interacting with their children while they played			1
they were observed for an hour and for half of that time the tv was on in the background			0
the researchers noted that while the tv was on , the quantity of words and phrases , as well as the number of new words spoken by the parents , was lower than when the tv was off			0
given that the language used by parents is so intrinsically linked with child language development , the results of the study suggest that prolonged exposure to background tv has a negative influence			1
children learn language skills from listening to their parents and their parents talk to them less if the tv is on and in light of recent findings that children in the @entity7 under 24 months watch an average 5.5 hours of background tv per day , the effect may be substantial			1
author of the study , @entity53 , said : ‘ our new results , along with past research finding negative effects of background tv on young children 's play and parent - child interaction , provide evidence that adult - directed tv content should be avoided for infants and toddlers whenever possible			2
‘ although it is impractical and probably not desirable for parents to play with their young child all of the time , children do benefit greatly from active involvement by parents during play			0
‘ ideally , parents should play with their child without the distraction of tv in the background			0
’ the @entity78 recently upheld their recommendation children under two years of age should not spend any time watching tv			0
while previously the guidelines focused on foreground media exposure , recent reports have noted the potential harm of background exposure as well , a form of tv exposure which parents may not be aware has any effect on their child at all .			2

children learn to speak from listening to their parents talking to them
when the tv is on in the background , parents talk to their children less
this means it can harm their language development , warn @entity7 research
