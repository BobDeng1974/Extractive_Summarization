all well and good having @entity0 in your team but they have to be the right ones – @entity4 reached the @entity6 semi-finals at the @entity7 at @entity9 ’s expense and @entity10 tied @entity11 in knots in the process			1
there were no @entity15 nutmegs this time but the former @entity17 defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as @entity10 scooted past him for @entity4 ’s opener			1
@entity10 ( top ) celebrates with @entity0 compatriot @entity21 after scoring his and @entity4 's second goal of the night @entity10 accelerates past another @entity24 teammate , @entity11 , before opening the scoring for @entity4 on tuesday night @entity4 : @entity26 6.5 ; @entity21 7.5 , @entity27 5 , @entity28 6 , @entity29 6 ; @entity30 7.5 , @entity31 7 ( @entity32 55 , 6 ) , @entity33 9 ( @entity34 45 , 6.5 ) ; @entity35 6.5 , @entity15 6.5 ( @entity36 75 , 6 ) , @entity10 9			1
subs not used : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41			0
goals : @entity10 14 , 34			1
@entity9 : @entity43 6 ; @entity44 3.5 , @entity45 4.5 , @entity11 5 , @entity46 6 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 4 ( @entity49 66 , 6.5 ) , @entity50 6 ( @entity51 80 , 6 ) ; @entity52 4 ( @entity53 80 , 6.5 ) , @entity54 4.5 , @entity55 3			1
subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60			0
referee : @entity62 ( @entity63 ) he was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team - mate got the second climbing unmarked to head @entity21 ’ cross past @entity43 to make it 5 - 1 on aggregate			1
@entity9 ’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again			2
@entity11 was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on @entity33 , who ran the first half			0
the man who won the @entity74 for @entity75 but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal , pulling away from @entity52 and swerving past @entity47 before releasing @entity10			2
the @entity80 champions thought they were back in the game between the two @entity4 goals when on 17 minutes @entity54 had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when @entity50 slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal			1
the @entity88 was jeered by @entity4 supporters in the early stages as was former @entity4 defender @entity46 but such was @entity4 ’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light - hearted abuse			2
@entity15 and @entity35 were also impressive in the first half and @entity21 looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer			0
@entity9 could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season			2
he tested @entity43 from distance before his assist for @entity10 ’s second			0
with @entity15 and @entity21 snapping into challenges and @entity33 and @entity10 providing the finesse @entity4 were completely dominant – to the extent that for once @entity35 was not their most impressive performer			1
the home side eased up after the break and @entity9 breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie			2
@entity107 saw his shot saved and @entity35 went close with chip that @entity43 gathered			0
@entity4 star @entity35 is reunited with his former @entity7 teammate @entity54 before kick - off on tuesday night @entity10 tucks the ball past @entity9 goalkeeper @entity43 to give @entity4 the lead after just 14 minutes @entity10 celebrates with @entity33 after the @entity75 and @entity4 star had slid him through for the opening goal @entity27 ( left ) joins in the celebrations after @entity4 had taken a 4 - 1 aggregate lead to relieve any pressure on them @entity120 's tennis no 1 @entity121 ( left ) was at the @entity7 alongside his friend and former tennis player @entity123 @entity9 did force a save from @entity26 10 minutes into the second half when @entity54 tried his luck from distance but the @entity130 keeper who has watched @entity38 not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display			1
missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in @entity137 would be some consolation			0
@entity140 ’s side were so comfortable at half - time @entity34 replaced the impeccable @entity33 at the break			0
and it was n’t long before @entity31 and @entity15 were also given early cuts			0
@entity4 still have a league to win and play the @entity147 derby against @entity148 this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over @entity151			1
@entity33 had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time			0
his performance and at times @entity4 ’s was a throwback to some of their best football under @entity158 when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011			0
@entity33 was in sensational form for @entity4 before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder @entity34 @entity4 's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best @entity158 was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that @entity173 were mauling @entity174 and were also heading for the semi-finals			1
the prospect of @entity4 and @entity173 being drawn together on thursday is mouth - watering			2
although perhaps on current form , and in view of his side ’s injuries , @entity158 might prefer to leave the reunions for @entity137 on june 6			0
@entity10 celebrates scoring his second goal of the night to put @entity4 5 - 1 up on aggregate to set up a semi-final place @entity10 chats with @entity35 after the second goal as @entity4 look ahead to next month 's semi-final			1

@entity4 through to @entity6 semi-finals after 5 - 1 aggregate win over @entity9
damage was done in first leg as @entity4 scored three away goals to take a *healthy* lead back to the @entity7
@entity10 scored twice in the first half to put result beyond any doubt on @entity54 's return to @entity4
