they are the generation who are likely to spend a large part of their lives sitting front of a screen			0
while many claim this can damage interpersonal skills , a new study claims that children under two can learn to communicate just as well from videos as they can from their parents			1
the @entity17 study claims to be the first to isolate the effects of what are described as ' educational commercial videos ' on infant learning			0

the @entity17 study claims to be the first to isolate the effects of what are described as ' educational commercial videos ' on infant learning @entity27 in @entity28 found that babies were consistently able to understand signs and pick out a photo of the object after watching a video for 15 minutes			1
the video was shown four times a week for three weeks			0
babies who watched the video performed just as well in tests as babies who had been taught signs by their parents under similar conditions			1
importantly , after a week without instruction , babies in all groups were still able to produce the signs 0 a much more difficult task than simply recognising them			1
however , babies in parent - supported groups were able to produce a greater number of signs overall			2
' this is the first controlled study to show that babies as young as 15 months can learn communicative skills from commercial videos just as well as from parents , ' says @entity56 , a lead researcher			1
' this is the first controlled study to show that babies as young as 15 months can learn communicative skills from commercial videos just as well as from parents , ' says @entity56 , a lead researcher ' they could recognise a novel photo of an object and label it using signs that they had only been exposed to from the video			1
' the researchers caution that the results should not be seen as an endorsement of video watching for children under two , which has been recommended against by the @entity70			2
' we ca n't speak to the short - term or long - term cognitive effects of video exposure for infants overall -- only the potential for instruction , ' professor @entity71 says			0
' there are many caveats to our research : the nature of the learning material matters and a lot may depend on the learning context and the formal features of the video			0
' the research does , however , demonstrate that video can be an effective teaching tool for children under the right circumstances			0
' the key takeaway is that babies can learn from commercial videos - at least signs , ' professor @entity56 says			2
' the majority of parents continue to expose their babies to video			1
it will be important to determine the conditions under which videos do and do not support infant learning			0
' video - based therapy for families with babies at risk of autism improves infants ' engagement , attention and social behaviour			2
it might also reduce their risk chances of developing the condition , according to a new study			0
researchers showed that using video feedback - based therapy to help parents understand and respond to their baby 's early communication style might help modify emerging autism symptoms			1
' targeting the earliest risk markers of autism , such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement , during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later , ' said @entity134 , a @entity135 professor of child and adolescent psychiatry			0
in this study , a specially adapted @entity138 ( @entity139 ) was delivered to babies aged seven to 10 months who had a higher risk of autism because they had an autistic older sibling			2
after five months , families who received video therapy showed improvements in infant engagement , attention and social behaviour , suggesting the therapy may be able to modify the emergence of autism - related symptoms , the researchers said .			0
