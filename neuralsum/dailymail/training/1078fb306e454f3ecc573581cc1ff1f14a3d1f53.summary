easy as one , two , three			0
@entity1 did n’t need to over-complicate this victory — the message was simple			0
get the ball wide , put @entity6 ’s fragile defence under pressure and reap the rewards			1
this was nothing to do about intensity or the @entity12 resembling a cauldron — the @entity14 simply were n’t good enough and could n’t deal with what was thrown at them			1
they were outplayed — both in and out of possession			1
@entity1 sounded as if the @entity19 had just routinely beaten a @entity20 or @entity21 , not a team boasting @entity23 and who have spent more than £ 100million on a revamped squad over the past year			0
saturday was the first time @entity6 have conceded three goals in the first half against a team other than @entity49 , @entity50 or @entity51 he certainly got it			1
nineteen seconds was all it took for @entity6 ’s back four to part ways			2
‘ they ’ll always try to be creative in the final third and rotate and circulate the ball so we talked about how when we did win it , we had to be progressive with our first pass and then drive the game the other way			0
’ almost as predictable were the seven words in two telling sentences that will fill a large section of the @entity6 support with serious justification for demanding change at the top			1
on trying to front up after their season plunged to new depths , @entity26 uttered the sort of reasons for defeat which may come back to haunt him			2
@entity75 scored after 19 seconds as @entity76 raced to a 3 - 0 lead over @entity6 on saturday afternoon firstly , that ‘ anger does n’t help ’ , even when three goals down at half - time			1
then that ‘ we have to learn ’ from the mistakes leading up to each goal			0
the fans , unfortunately , are tired of hearing it			0
they want @entity26 to lose his cool and address a flimsy backbone ; instead he is trotting out the same excuses which now wo n’t wash with the majority			2
‘ of course you ’re angry when you ’re 3 - 0 down at @entity76			1
but anger does n’t help , you need to see what you can do to come back , ’ @entity26 said			2
‘ honestly , i feel the spirit of the team is great and they want to do well			0
‘ @entity76 were out of the blocks sharper than us and we have to learn from that			1
i think we were just too tender in the challenges , not decisive on corners and crosses			0
’ @entity26 ( left ) reacts to a disappointing @entity6 performance on the @entity12 bench @entity6 struggled to deal with @entity29 ( right ) for large periods - @entity103 was sent off for this challenge this is from a man who only last week said he expects the @entity14 to win a @entity107 title before his contract expires in three years			1
they are a long , long way off and he knows it			0
@entity6 were unlocked not by a player of @entity76 ’s ilk , but one who would look at home at @entity32			1
@entity115 was incapable of dealing with @entity29 , signed from @entity116 in the summer , and the visitors never recovered from the early flurry			0
@entity26 has seen his side fail at the @entity12 for the last four years but never before have they been so obviously outplayed			1
but while it seemed clear where the problems lay , @entity6 , and their ailing manager , failed to address them			2
‘ you come out of the game and think ... ’ @entity26 said , puffing out his cheeks			2
‘ it ’s unbelievable you did n’t get anything out of this game just because we did n’t start well			0
’ frankly , not even @entity26 is believing that rationale any longer .			0

@entity6 were beaten 3 - 2 at @entity76 , after being 3 - 0 down at half - time
@entity14 ' fans have begun to demand a change in management
@entity6 were outplayed both in and out of possession against @entity76
@entity26 admitted that @entity76 were out of the blocks quicker than @entity6
