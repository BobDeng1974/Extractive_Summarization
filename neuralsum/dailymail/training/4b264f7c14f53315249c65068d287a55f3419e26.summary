@entity0 created the little bit of history that he desired by ensuring @entity3 remained undefeated in normal and extra time with a 3 - 0 third - place play - off victory over hosts @entity6			1
a penalty from @entity9 after just three minutes , a @entity11 strike and a @entity13 goal in injury time ensured a comfortable win for @entity17 's men in @entity18			1
here , @entity19 rates all of the players involved in the match			0
success : @entity0 's @entity3 side triumphed 3 - 0 over @entity6 in the third - place play - off @entity25 : @entity9 put @entity3 ahead after just three minutes with an excellent penalty kick three - down : @entity13 adds a third for @entity3 as they comfortably see off @entity6 in @entity18 bewildered : @entity6 coach @entity29 has seen his side concede ten goals in just two matches laughter : @entity33 ( left ) was injured and unable to play but he still took his place on the @entity6 bench @entity36 @entity37 - 6 poor for the last goal but helpless for the first two			1
@entity39 - 6 look likes a player who is treading water regularly but did okay at times			0
@entity43 - 5 poor for the second goal but was not anyway as awful as he was against @entity47			0
poor : @entity43 ( left ) and @entity48 ( right ) struggled to deal with @entity50 's pace throughout @entity51 - 6 totally out - paced by @entity50 after just two minutes for the penalty but he does make a difference to this @entity6 side			1
@entity55 - 6 ran his heart out for @entity6 but this is just not a classy @entity58 side we expect			2
@entity60 - 5 usually controls the midfield for @entity6 but his form has deserted him in the last couple of matches			2
anger : @entity6 captain @entity51 ( left ) appeals after giving away a second - minute penalty @entity69 - 6 he will run around for you as much as you like but he is also prone to committing a foul - and he made a couple of bad ones in this match			1
@entity48 - 5 could not get himself into the match and had very little impact			0
@entity78 - 7 extremely unfortunate to be booked for diving when clearly clipped in the box and @entity6 's most creative player			1
hacked : @entity78 ( left ) was fouled by @entity82 ( right ) in the box but the @entity36 midfielder was booked for diving booking : @entity78 ( centre on ground ) was yellow carded for simulation during the second half in @entity18 @entity92 - 6 should probably have featured more in this tournament because his workrate alone is infectious			2
@entity96 - 5 his @entity97 days may be long behind him but he is simply not a striker who should wear the @entity36 shirt			0
@entity101 : @entity102 46 ( for @entity103 ) , @entity104 70 ( for @entity69 ) , hernanes 57 ( for @entity48 )			0
booked : @entity51 , @entity78			0
manager : @entity29 - 5			0
his side have conceded 10 goals in two matches and he must surely lose his job now			0
deputising : @entity110 's @entity92 ( number 19 ) played reasonably well considering his lack of @entity114 action terrible : an awful week for @entity29 got even worse as his side conceded 10 goals in just two matches @entity3 @entity117 - 7 did n't have too much to do but when he did he was commanding			1
@entity119 - 7 every time @entity3 attacked the full - back seemed to be involved - he looks to be a real find			1
@entity82 - 7 the @entity123 centre - back has been a colossus in this tournament and he was once again			0
strong : @entity3 centre - back @entity82 ( right ) has been a colossus throughout the tournament @entity130 - 6 the least effective of @entity3 's defence but still relatively untroubled			2
@entity132 - 6 admirably played despite having his head stapled and as industrious as ever			0
@entity13 - 7 finished off the result with a goal in injury time and had looked threatening throughout			1
finish : @entity11 scored a brilliant second for @entity3 as they cruised to victory in @entity18 @entity141 - 6 is not a player who will ever set the world alight but he does exactly what @entity17 wants of him @entity145 - 6 the @entity147 star had a relatively quiet match but he had some nice touches here and there			1
@entity11 - 7 his finish for the second goal was sublime and he has had a really impressive tournament			2
foul : @entity50 ( left ) is dragged back by @entity6 captain @entity51 in just the second minute of the match booking : @entity50 received a tellow card during the third - place play - off match with @entity6 in @entity18 @entity50 - 8 broke free after just two minutes to win the penalty and continued his fantastic tournament			1
@entity9 - 6 stepped up and coolly slotted home third - minute penalty but still did not dominate as we know he can			2
@entity101 : @entity167 90 ( for @entity117 ) , @entity168 70 ( for @entity169 ) , @entity170 90 ( for @entity171 )			0
booked : @entity50 , @entity172			0
goals : @entity174 3 , @entity11 17 , @entity13 90 manager : @entity0 - 7			1
delivered exactly what he said he would be ensuring the @entity177 were undefeated in normal and extra time throughout the tournament			0
referee : @entity180 ( @entity181 ) 7 as cool as you like : @entity183 steps up and slots the ball home from 12 yards after @entity50 is up - ended celebration : @entity183 points to the sky after putting after his third - minute penalty against @entity6 delivered : @entity17 ensured his side remained undefeated in all matches in normal and extra time			1

@entity3 win 3 - 0 in third - place play - off match against host @entity6
a @entity9 penalty and @entity11 strike ensured comfortable win
@entity13 added a third for the @entity177 in injury time
@entity0 's men pick up the bronze medals in the match in @entity18
