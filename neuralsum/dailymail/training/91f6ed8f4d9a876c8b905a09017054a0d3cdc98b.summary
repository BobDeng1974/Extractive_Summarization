the boom in beekeeping may be doing our countryside more harm than good			0
for a surge in the number of bumblebee hives means thousands of colonies are being imported			1
and many of these are riddled with parasites that pose a threat to native species , a study has found			1
essential pollinator : but many of the bee colonies currently being imported from the continent are riddled with parasites with @entity21 bees already in peril , scientists say the trade must be tightened up			1
commercial gardeners have long kept bumblebees to boost the pollination of their crops			0
but recently home owners have joined the trend , to do their bit for the environment			0
as a result , the number of bumblebee colonies imported from the continent each year has soared to between 40,000 and 50,000			1
however , research from @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 found that many of the foreign colonies harbour dangerous bugs			2
the study of 48 bumblebee colonies bought from three @entity46 suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected			1
eight different parasites were found and some colonies contained several different diseases			1
passed to our native bees , these parasites could deform their wings , leaving them unable to fly , shorten their life or even kill			2
risk : a study of 48 bumblebee colonies bought from three @entity46 suppliers found 77 per cent to be infected with parasites @entity59 researcher @entity58 said : ‘ some of the parasites damage fat stores , many reduce lifespan			1
they can also affect the ability of the insect to learn and can be lethal			0
’ one of the bugs found on the bumblebees can be passed to honeybees , where it deforms wings to such an extent the insects can not fly			2
some strains may be new to @entity21 and there are fears that having high numbers of these bees near plants visited by native insects will speed up the spread of disease			0
@entity21 ’s bumblebees are already in peril , with intensive farming , changing climate , pollution and disease blamed for two of the 25 native species going extinct and many others struggling to survive			0
commercial gardeners use the foreign colonies to boost production of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries in greenhouses and polytunnels			2
in recent years , home gardeners have also started to buy them and pay up to £ 100 for a cardboard box of bumblebees to be delivered to their home			0
the colony , with a queen and up to 100 worker bees , can be used to pollinate lavender and other plants			0
the researchers , whose study was published in the @entity109 , want tighter import controls , with bees checked for disease on arrival in the @entity21			0
professor @entity58 said : ‘ if we do n’t act , then the risk is that tens of thousands of parasite - carrying colonies may be imported in the @entity21 each year			1
