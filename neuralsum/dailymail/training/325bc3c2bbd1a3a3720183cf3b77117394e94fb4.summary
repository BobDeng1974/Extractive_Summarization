@entity1 defector @entity0 today defended his decision to join @entity3 - declaring : ' i stab people in the front , not the back '			1
mr @entity0 returned to his @entity8 constituency this morning with @entity3 leader @entity9 amid speculation many more conservative mps have considered defecting			1
today , the multi-millionaire @entity3 donor @entity13 confirmed that he had wined and dined around eight backbench @entity1 mps in an attempt to encourage them to switch allegiance			1
he added that there were ' another eight i could have easily taken out '			0
mr @entity13 told @entity32 he took the mps to a restaurant called @entity35 , which he said was no longer open			1
he said : ‘ i did n't say “ would you defect ? ”			0
i would say “ would you like to meet @entity9 ? ”			2
some of them said yes and obviously @entity0 was one of them			2
’ mr @entity0 - who officially stood down from @entity40 today - said he was taking a risk by forcing a by - election but denied that he had been disloyal to prime minister @entity43			1
he added : ‘ i like @entity43 , he 's a nice guy , he 's actually good fun			2
‘ i do n't think i 've ever stabbed anybody in the back , maybe i occasionally stab one or two people in the front but i 've been frank and straight with people			0
‘ but i think he 's not serious about change in @entity51 and i 've put my political career on the line			0
’ the visit attracted a mixed response from passers - by with one woman shouting at mr @entity0 : ‘ the traitor 's blocking the street - stop blocking the street , traitor			2
’ but several cars honked their horns in a show of support and taxi drivers pulled over to praise mr @entity0			2
mr @entity0 was among nine @entity67 wined and dined by mr @entity13 at a series of discreet lunches in @entity70			1
‘ @entity13 is quietly confident that more may follow @entity0 , ’ a source said , adding that the @entity33 were happy to talk to mr @entity13 – a former @entity1 who defected to @entity3 – ‘ because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty ’			1
‘ @entity13 understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey , ’ the source said			0
mr @entity43 was ambushed by the defection of mr @entity0 – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the prime minister ’s policy on @entity51			1
the mp announced he was joining @entity3 and forcing a by - election in his @entity8 constituency in @entity88 , which will be a nightmare for the @entity67 to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010			2
it is understood that mr @entity0 was among nine @entity67 wined and dined by millionaire @entity3 donor @entity13 at a series of discreet lunches in @entity70 mr @entity43 was given no prior warning of the announcement and could only watch as @entity3 leader @entity9 triumphantly paraded mr @entity0 live on tv			1
the dramatic move has increased pressure on the prime minister to toughen his stance on immigration and @entity51 to stem the risk of further defections			0
@entity1 whips were scrambled to ring round @entity106 mps to shore up support			2
a senior @entity1 source insisted that mr @entity0 appeared to be a ‘ lone wolf ’ and played down the prospect of further departures			1
and mr @entity43 angrily dismissed mr @entity0 ’s move as ‘ self - defeating ’			1
‘ it is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people behave in this way , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is also , in my view , counter-productive			0
’ mr @entity43 was ambushed by the defection of mr @entity0 who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the prime minister 's policy on @entity51 mr @entity9 claimed he had been involved in talks with a number of @entity1 @entity33 over the past six months who ‘ very strongly support everything @entity3 is trying to do ’			1
he predicted that further defections will follow if mr @entity0 triumphs in the by - election , which is likely to be held on october 9 – the week after the @entity1 party conference			1
‘ the real answer to the question about how many others will join , will all depend on this by - election , ’ he said			0
‘ this by - election is going to be a @entity141 moment			0
’ however , mr @entity0 faced an immediate potential setback when @entity3 ’s existing candidate in @entity8 refused to make way for him			1
@entity145 told mr @entity0 to ‘ get in the queue ’ but a @entity3 spokesman said mr @entity145 had been selected to fight next year ’s general election , not the by - election			1
mr @entity0 ’s announcement came hours after official figures showed mr @entity43 has almost no chance of keeping his pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year – last year it rose nearly 40 per cent to 243,000 , largely on the back of new arrivals from the @entity157			1
senior tory @entity158 said : ‘ the prime minister has got to spell out in far more detail and indeed in far more fundamental terms what he means ... we do n’t want to have our economy controlled by the @entity157 , we want to control the number of people coming in and out of our country			0
if we want all these things , we ’re going to have to change our relationship fundamentally with the @entity157			0
’ fellow @entity1 @entity171 described mr @entity0 ’s departure as a ‘ wake - up call ’ while @entity1 veteran @entity174 acknowledged that ‘ one or two ’ colleagues were tempted to join @entity3 although he suggested that they would not			1
mr @entity0 , an early supporter of mr @entity43 ’s leadership bid , said the prime minister was ‘ not serious about change ’ when it came to the @entity157 and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election			1
speaking at a press conference in @entity25 alongside mr @entity9 , he said : ‘ the problem is that many of those at the top of the @entity1 are simply not on our side			2
they are n’t serious about the change that @entity188 so desperately needs			0
of course they talk the talk before elections			0
they say what they feel they must say to get our support ... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics , on the recall of @entity33 , on controlling our borders , on less government , on bank reform , on cutting public debt , on an @entity157 referendum – they never actually make it happen			0
’ mr @entity0 addresses a press conference in @entity25 after being introduced by the @entity3 leader @entity9 news of the defection was relayed to mr @entity43 at @entity206			1
speaking later in @entity208 , where he was giving a speech , the prime minister said : ‘ if you want a referendum on @entity188 ’s future in the @entity157 , whether we should stay or go , the only way to get that is to have a @entity1 government after the next election			0
that is what , until very recently , @entity0 himself was saying			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s decision to trigger a by - election leaves the @entity1 facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming @entity3 ’s first elected mp			1
he has built a @entity1 majority of over 12,000 in what had been a @entity228 seat			0
@entity1 sources last night said the by - election would be held ‘ sooner rather than later ’ to prevent @entity3 gaining momentum			2
bookmakers immediately installed mr @entity0 as the odds - on favourite to hold the seat			2
mr @entity0 ’s sudden departure stunned @entity106 colleagues who believed he had settled his differences with the leadership – he publicly urged colleagues to stop rocking the boat six months ago , writing on @entity241 : ‘ only the @entity1 will guarantee and deliver an in / out referendum			1
it will only happen if @entity43 is prime minister			0
’ former defence secretary @entity243 said : ‘ after the next general election , either @entity244 is going to be the prime minister , or @entity43			0
if it ’s not @entity43 there ’s not going to be a referendum on @entity51			0
' what ’s worse , we ’ll get a return to open door immigration policies which many of the @entity3 supporters seem to dislike most of all			0

@entity0 resigned from the @entity1 and @entity40
he said @entity43 was ' not serious about changes country needed '
@entity224 is among nine @entity67 ' wined and dined by @entity3 donor @entity13 '
mr @entity13 today revealed he could have ' easily ' invited eight more mps
today , mr @entity0 hit the campaign trail with @entity3 leader @entity9
he defended his decision to defect from the @entity67 amid *criticism* from mps
