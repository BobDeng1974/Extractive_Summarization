by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 22 october 2013 plenty of people have installed breadmakers in their kitchens to make fresh loaves , but now a company in @entity7 plans on launching a compact home - brewing system so beer fans never run out of pints			1
just like a breadmaker , the microwave - sized machine allows users to add a handful of fresh ingredients into it and push a button to make a keg of beer			1
the @entity21 system costs £ 992 and claims to brew ' high quality all - grain beer ' in a week from three ingredients - water , grain and hops			1
the invention , which has exceeded its fundraising target on crowd - funding website @entity40 , is the brainchild of two brothers in @entity7			1
they came up with the idea three years ago and have invested ' thousands of man hours ' in designing the machine			0
the machine takes three - and - a - half hours to make beer wort or unfermented beer , which is then kept in a keg after yeast is added			1
in just one week the final beer recipe is ready to drink to work the machine , users start by picking a recipe and filling a five - gallon keg with water - attaching it on the side the the @entity21			1
home brewers then add the grain to the main compartment of the machine ( called the step filter ) and pour hops into the appropriate hops cages that slot into the step filter , according to the recipe , before selecting the recipe to brew using the front panel screen on the machine			2
in about three - and - a - half hours the keg is no longer filled with water but contains beer wort - or fermented beer			2
to work the machine , users start by picking a recipe and fill a five gallon keg with water - attaching it on the side the the @entity21			1
home brewers then add the grain to the main compartment of the machine , called the step filter the brewer then only has to detach the keg from the machine and chill it to room temperature before adding yeast and sealing it shut			2
the company says the final recipe will then be ready in a week 's time			0
@entity85 and @entity86 started their company @entity87 in 2010 out of frustration with home - brewing kits because they ' take up too much time , are too imprecise and frankly , when you account for all of the clean - up , are not all that fun '			0
once the grain is in place , users fill the appropriate hops cages according to their chosen recipe that slot into the step filter			0
in about three - and - a - half - hours the keg is no longer filled with water but contains un-fermented beer ' we wanted to make the creation of high - quality beer brewing simple , amp up the art , and tone down the tedium , ' said @entity112 , who spent over 19 years at @entity113 , creating computing appliances for consumers			1
having built a proof of concept model , the brothers created subsequent models to come up with a new brewing process that allows the pre-loading of ingredients with little human input aside from pushing some buttons and filling containers			0
as well as building a motherboard , the pair worked on refining the brewing process - especially mash efficiency and hops utilisation - for the next generation models and moved into a lab in downtown @entity7 on @entity132			0
users select a recipe using the screen on the front of the @entity87 machine			0
the brothers behind the invention created software that allows users to make recipes by importing existing beer recipes that they like , which are automatically scaled for use in the @entity21 after three years and a dozen prototypes , the founding members of @entity87 have raised over three times the amount of money they needed on @entity149			1
as home - brewing fans , they said they were frustrated that some recipes could not be easily used for different makers and kits , and have consequently created the @entity155 software			0
the software allows users to make recipes by importing existing beer recipes that are automatically scaled for use in the @entity87 machine			2
@entity85 and @entity86 started their company @entity87 in 2010 out of frustration with home - brewing kits			0
here , their creation is pictured alongside an industrial - scale machine at @entity164			0

the machine allows users to add a handful of fresh ingredients into it and push a button to make a keg of beer .
