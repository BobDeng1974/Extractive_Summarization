@entity0 will not turn his back on @entity2 after insisting he is ready to battle to reclaim his place in @entity5 ’s line - up			1
@entity7 ’s captain was scrutinised after @entity2 tumbled out of the @entity8 and @entity5 looked at different defensive options during the recent games against @entity11 and @entity12 , though he did put @entity0 to close out a victory in @entity14			1
@entity0 has not looked to have talks with @entity5 about where he stands in the squad but he does accept that , on recent evidence , he has fallen behind @entity19 and @entity20 in the pecking order to be @entity23 ’s partner			1
@entity0 ( right ) will not turn his back on @entity2 and insists he is ready to battle to reclaim his place @entity0 talks to goalkeeper @entity25 as @entity7 thrashed @entity26 in @entity27 on thursday night that , however , is not going to be a signal for him to end his career after winning 30 caps			1
though he admitted the fallout from the @entity8 was a difficult experience , @entity0 maintains his confidence has not been affected and is aiming to show @entity5 he can play a role going forward			1
‘ there is no point beating myself up about things , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i want to play in winning teams and be a big part of a winning team , so there were some aspects i needed to sort out for myself			2
there are periods of a career where you feel you can not do too much right			2
‘ after the game against @entity12 i was as happy as anyone else			1
i have not pushed my career as far as i can to get to the highest level just to spit my dummy out and say ‘ i ’m not going to come just because you ’re not playing me ’			2
i would like to play every game and play a big part of it			0
‘ it does n’t feel nice ( being dropped by @entity2 )			1
that is the easiest way of saying it , but the manager has a job to do			0
if you look at building for the future that can work against me , but if you start looking too deeply at things it is not going to do me any favours			0
‘ i ’m not going to demand reasons for not playing			0
what is there for me to speak to ( @entity5 ) about ? a lot of people could do that for @entity2			1
that is not what it is about			0
we are part of a team and if the manager makes a decision you stick by it			0
all i can do is my best			0
’ @entity23 ( left ) is @entity2 's premier central defender with @entity19 preferred as his partner at the back before this season began , @entity0 said he would “ not know for a month ” whether the @entity8 had left a scar			1
if his initial displays were scratchy – @entity7 conceded 10 times in their opening three games – his last two performances against @entity89 and @entity26 have been much better			1
‘ i do not feel it has ( left a mark ) , ’ said @entity0 , whose side face @entity91 tomorrow			2
‘ it is an obvious assumption to make because it has not been great and could have been a lot better since			0
on a personal level i do not go around shouting about things			0
‘ i am sure i would not have been asked this if we had won the first three games of the season and kept clean sheets			0
i know i have to answer these questions			0
it has been a sticky four months but the players and coaching staff ( at @entity7 ) have been brilliant			2
‘ i do not think i have been horrific but when you look at the results i have been part of you can throw criticism my way and it is something i have to deal with			0
