by @entity0 @entity1 claimed his party had ' done well ' and was ' making progress ' - but some feel @entity5 is floundering @entity5 's ‘ elitist and arrogant ’ leaders have been attacked by their own mps over their complacent reaction to the party ’s dismal election results			1
@entity1 claimed his party had ‘ done well ’ and was ‘ making progress ’ – despite being the first opposition leader in 30 years not to take first place in the @entity14 poll			2
but former @entity5 ministers said the party was ‘ heading for catastrophe ’ and was failing to tackle the @entity18 threat or appeal to voters outside @entity20			1
one said the @entity14 result was a ‘ terrible ’ one , and that anyone in mr @entity1 ’s circle who believed it meant @entity5 was on course for a general election victory needed their ‘ heads examining ’			1
others accused the party ’s leadership of having their ‘ pointy heads in the sand ’ – and said mr @entity1 ’s refusal to back a referendum on @entity14 was ‘ untenable ’			2
@entity5 finished second behind @entity18 in the @entity38 elections , taking just over 25 per cent of the vote – marginally ahead of the @entity40 on 24 per cent			1
the local council results were also disappointing , with @entity5 winning 31 per cent of the vote to the @entity40 ’ 29 per cent			1
pollsters say an opposition leader wishing to win next year ’s general election would need to be doing far better at this stage – with @entity48 president @entity47 saying @entity5 should be ‘ terrified ’			1
but mr @entity1 , who will today visit @entity49 in @entity50 – the site of some of @entity18 ’s greatest victories – said @entity5 had ‘ done well ’ and again refused to hold an in / out referendum on @entity14			1
‘ @entity5 made real progress in these elections , pushing the @entity40 into third place for the first time ever in a national election , ’ he said			1
‘ i think we did well , from a party that in 2010 got one of its worst shares of the vote ever in an election			0
‘ in lots of the key areas that we need to win , @entity5 was actually winning			1
so i think that is a sign that @entity5 can win the general election			1
’ but one former minister responded by saying : ‘ this is a terrible result for @entity5			1
‘ if the people around @entity1 think they are on course for an election victory on this basis , they need their heads examined			0
‘ i ’ve not met anyone on the doorstep who is saying anything warm about @entity1 at all			0
whatever good ideas he may be having ; people are not listening			1
’ ¿ if the people around @entity1 think they are on course for an election victory on this basis , they need their heads examined , ' said one former minister the @entity14 results show @entity5 did better in the capital ; comfortably topping the poll and taking four seats			1
but the former minister warned : ‘ @entity20 has a larger proportion of people who vote for us , like ethnic minorities and the young , @entity5 is not appealing to ordinary men and women in the rest of @entity99			1
’ @entity100 , who served as a social security minister under @entity102 , said the @entity5 leadership was ‘ in denial ’ about @entity18			1
‘ we have to offer a referendum			0
ordinary voters think @entity5 ’s position is untenable , ’ he said			2
‘ they think we ’re shoving two fingers up their nose			0
‘ we will have a catastrophe at the next election if we go on like this			0
‘ our voters are trying to give us one last chance and tell us they want change			0
@entity1 has got to free himself from this or he will drag us down with him			0
’ many @entity5 mps complain the public thinks @entity1 is weird – while others said the failure to offer the public a referendum on @entity126 membership was making @entity5 ’s policies ‘ unattractive ’			2
@entity128 , mp for @entity129 and @entity130 , said the leadership was guilty of huge complacency in the face of the @entity135 threat and called on mr @entity1 to change his tune on immigration and @entity14			0
he said : ‘ i think it ’s very elitist and arrogant			0
while these elections were about @entity14 and there were certainly some protest votes , there were also some people voting against the direction this country is going in @entity14			0
unless we have a policy response to that , which has to be … a referendum , then we ’re going to lose votes			0
’ @entity150 , mp for @entity151 , tweeted : ‘ mmm , @entity5 official briefing calls results excellent			2
pointy heads in the sand			0
’ @entity156 , mp for @entity157 and @entity158 , previously warned about the dangers of ignoring the @entity160 and now believes the same may be happening with @entity18			0
the former minister said : ‘ i think the lesson for @entity5 is that it ca n’t set the agenda for people ’s lives from @entity166			1
we have to really listen … and really respond			0
’ @entity168 , mp for @entity169 , said the leadership had not been listening to ordinary people			2
‘ the @entity5 is crazy not to call for a referendum , ’ he said			2
he told the @entity173 : ‘ we should have committed to an @entity126 referendum before these elections			0
’ @entity177 , @entity5 ’s largest private donor and chairman of @entity180 , said : ‘ people have clearly voted for parties offering a referendum on our membership of the @entity126			1
in some areas @entity18 are taking @entity5 votes			2
’ a source close to mr @entity1 said the party was not going to try and ‘ out - @entity18 ’ by offering a referendum			0
‘ this is the first time we have beaten the conservatives for 20 years in @entity14 and the first time we have got more than 4million votes for 20 years , ’ he said .			0

@entity195 claims the party is ' doing well ' even though it only just edged @entity40
but top party officials say @entity5 is ' heading for catastrophe '
one said : ' whatever good ideas he may be having ; people are not listening '
