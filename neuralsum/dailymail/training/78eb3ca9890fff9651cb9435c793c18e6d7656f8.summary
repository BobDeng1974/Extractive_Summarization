by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 30 september 2013 private spaceflight company , @entity1 , has successfully launched the first of its newly - improved @entity4 rockets			1
the 22 - story rocket soared off a launch pad at @entity7 at 4pm gmt on sunday			2
the nine - engine rocket is its most powerful to date and designed to test the viability of using fully reusable launch vehicles for future missions			1
the 22 - story rocket soared off a launch pad at @entity7 at 4pm gmt on sunday currently , after delivering their payloads into orbit , booster rockets tumble back toward @entity17 and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea			1
this is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £ 280 million			1
@entity1 , however , is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on @entity17 so that they can be recovered and recycled			1
the @entity4 blazed through clear blue skies out over the @entity27 , its water vapour trail visible even as the rocket left the atmosphere			0
@entity4 topped with @entity1 fairing is 224.4 feet ( 68.4 meters ) tall and 12 feet in diameter ( the fairing is 17 feet in diameter )			1
its nine first - stage @entity35 engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust at sea level , rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as @entity4 climbs out of the @entity17 ’s atmosphere			1
falcon 9 is named after the @entity43 starship in the @entity45 movies			0
the number 9 refers to the nine @entity35 engines that power falcon 9 ’s first stage ; one @entity35 vacuum engine powers the second stage			2
during sunday 's launch , three first - stage engines were reignited , to see if they could bring the first - stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact			2
another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water			2
‘ it went better than expected			0
it was incredibly smooth , ’ @entity1 founder @entity61 told @entity62			2
nestled inside the rocket 's new 17 - foot ( 5 - meter ) diameter nose cone was a small @entity66 science satellite called @entity67 that initially was to fly on @entity1 's now - discontinued @entity68			2
‘ it 's certainly a huge relief to have successfully delivered @entity67 to orbit			0
it 's been weighing on me quite heavily , ’ @entity61 said			0
space x is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on @entity17 so that they can be recovered and recycled			1
pictured is the @entity4 rocket ‘ the most revolutionary thing about the new @entity4 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase , which is almost three - quarters of the cost of the rocket , ’ @entity61 added			0
neither engine restart test went perfectly , but engineers were able to get enough data to plan on a demonstration flight next year			1
‘ the most important thing is we now believe we have all the pieces of the puzzle , ’ @entity61 said			0
the upgraded @entity4 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions , longer fuel tanks , new avionics and software intended to boost lift capacity and simplify operations for commercial service			0
privately - owned @entity1 has contracts for more than 50 launches of its new @entity4 and planned @entity101 rockets			1
ten of those missions are to fly cargo to the @entity104 for @entity105			0
@entity4 9 's next mission is to put a communications satellite into orbit for @entity109			0
the launch is targeted for next month from @entity111 in @entity112 .			0

launch *allowed* @entity1 to test *technology* to make launch vehicles reusable
currently rockets fall back toward @entity17 and explode mid-air before crashing
this is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £ 280 million
neither engine restart went perfectly , but engineers were able to get enough data to plan on a demonstration flight next year
