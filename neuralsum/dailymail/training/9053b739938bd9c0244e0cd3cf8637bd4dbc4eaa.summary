by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 5 november 2013 tiny urns containing the remains of babies cremated two - and - a - half millenia ago have been discovered in a mass grave in @entity6			0
archaeologists made the discovery as they excavated a cemetery in the @entity6 village of @entity11 near @entity12 and found the remains of thousands of settlers buried in 150 graves , or ' pit tombs			1
' these tombs were common during the @entity18 , when members of @entity21 culture across @entity22 were cremated upon death and buried together in urns , with some ashes being offered as gifts to the gods			1
during the @entity18 , members of the @entity21 culture were cremated			1
family members would then bury the urns with clay gifts			2
in one grave , archaeologists found a tiny urn next to an early baby 's rattle in the shape of a pillow made from clay and filled with small balls , pictured during the @entity42 culture flourished across @entity22			2
lusatian culture spread from @entity6 , into the @entity43 and @entity44 as well as parts of @entity46			1
the dead were cremated and buried in their thousands together - with some being offered as gifts to the gods			1
the ashes were placed in urns and were understood as vessels that took the deceased on their ‘ last journey ’			2
family members would decorate these urns with elaborate patterns , or bury their loved ones with various clay gifts to send them on their way to the gods			2
these urns were understood as ‘ vessels ’ that took the deceased on their ‘ last journey ’ , claimed lead archaeologist @entity67			0
when one person died , their ashes were stored in an urn and placed in a designated ' pit tomb ' within a cemetery			2
as more people died , the urns were grouped together until the tomb was full			2
it would then be covered over and the urns would be buried			2
if members of the same family died before the tomb was covered over , they would be added to the same tomb			0
families would also choose tombs , in a similar way funeral plots are allocated today			0
this means the child graves discovered by @entity67 could have been surrounded by the parents and relatives of the child , or put in a mass grave with others from the same community			0
@entity67 added family members would decorate urns with elaborate patterns , or bury their loved ones with various clay gifts - such as the rattle that was found - to send them on their way to the gods			1
many of the elaborate urns were decorated with images that depicted the @entity21 way of life , including horse riding and agriculture			1
the people of the @entity21 culture were believed to be mainly cattle , pig and goat farmers			1
among the remains discovered in @entity11 , @entity67 also found bronze items including pins and a sickle , plus what appeared to be an early razor			1
urns were classed as ' vessels ' that took the deceased on their ' last journey '			0
traditional burials were rare in the @entity21 culture and almost all settlers would have been cremated			1
the ashes were placed in urns covered with a bowl lid			2
dozens of urns would then be buried together in the same location , pictured a number of the urns discovered in @entity11 featured bird symbols , or had connotations with birds			1
this piece of pottery was buried with an urn as a ' gift to the gods ' and is a jug for poring water			0
the handle is shaped like a duck @entity67 told the @entity146 : ' the dead bodies were burnt at the stake			0
after that , any remaining bones were carefully collected and put into the urn covered by bigger bowls , often in an anatomical arrangement			0
' this meant legs and feet were put in first , ribs in the centre and the skull would be placed on top			0
not all cremations lasted long enough to turn the entire body to ash			0
jewellery , sickles and small axes were then added after the cremation and @entity67 said researchers know this because the tools and jewellery usually show no signs of fire or burning			0
one pit tomb discovered in @entity11 contained bones of a number of people , which @entity67 believes all belonged to one family - as was tradition			1
sometimes human bones were even mixed with animal bones			0
some tombs contained urns and small pieces of pottery and @entity67 said he plans to test these small pots to see if they contained milk , water or alcohol given as a ' gift '			2
in one grave , @entity67 found a tiny urn next to an early baby ’s rattle in the shape of a pillow made from clay and filled with small balls			0
traditional burials were rare in the @entity21 culture and almost all the settlers would have been cremated			1
@entity67 told @entity146 : ' in @entity18 the custom of burning the dead people spread over most of @entity22 , including the current territory of @entity6			2
' from this period , and from the early @entity207 , we know of many cemeteries contained hundreds or even thousands of pit tomb			1
' he added the custom was more than likely due to people during this period having ' solar beliefs ' and worshipping the sun. the ashes were usually placed in urns and these were covered with a bowl lid before being turned upside @entity219 of urns would then be placed in the ground in the same locations to create ‘ grave pits			2
’ during @entity67 ’s excavations he found one pit contained as many as 40 urns filled with ashes , plus various gifts			1
in another grave containing the remains of what appeared to be a child , @entity67 discovered a spoon with a handle shaped like a bird			0
while a third contained a decorated bowl with a small bird - like figure inside			0
some family members would decorate the urns with elaborate patterns , as seen on this vessel discovered in @entity11 , pictured			1
many were decorated with images that depicted the @entity21 way of life , including horse riding and agriculture one pit tomb discovered in @entity11 , pictured , contained bones of a number of people , which lead research @entity67 believes may have all belonged to one family - as was traditional at that time ‘ a quite unique discovery in this part of the @entity6 is a small rectangular clay object , associated with the cult of hearth and home , so - called moon idol , ’ explained @entity67			1
he continued that such objects are usually found in @entity265 cemeteries , mostly from the area of @entity267 around 136 miles south of @entity11			1
the @entity268 spread from @entity6 , into the @entity43 and @entity44 as well as parts of @entity46 during the @entity18 and early @entity207			1
in 1933 @entity6 archaeologists discovered remains of a @entity18 settlement in @entity273 ( @entity274 ) which later became known as @entity275 and was among the first excavations of a @entity21 culture settlement			1
another was found in @entity279 near @entity280			0
records written by @entity6 priest @entity282 in the fifteenth century were the first to mention the cemetery found near @entity12			1
the site location was then pinpointed , pictured , to the village of @entity11 in the @entity286 both sites contained open villages with fortified settlements made up of wooden boxes filled with soil or stones			2
the forts were built on top of hills , or in swamps , and cemeteries were created nearby			0
it is believed that the graves found in swampy areas were full of ‘ gifts to the gods ’ – a place where settlers who had been sacrificed would be placed			1
what is believed to be sacrificial pits found in @entity307 in @entity46 were found to contain human bones buried as deep at five metres			0
according to researchers , the dead bodies were burnt at the stake			0
after that , bones were carefully collected and put into urns , pictured , covered by bigger bowls , often in an anatomical arrangement			0
this meant the feet and legs went in first and the skull sat on top records written by @entity6 priest @entity282 in the fifteenth century were the first to mention the cemetery found near @entity12			1
according to @entity326 in @entity6 , the notes said : ‘ born from the womb of the earth are pots , by themselves , only by the art of nature , without any human helping , of all sorts of different shapes , similar to those people use , though delicate and soft , while still rooted in their family soil in the ground , yet when they are removed they become tight and hardened in the sun or wind			0
’ the site location was then pinpointed to the village of @entity11 in the @entity286			0
the work was carried out by the @entity346 in @entity12 .			0

more than 150 graves were found in a cemetery in @entity11 , near @entity12
they contained thousands of urns full of the ashes of @entity21 settlers
