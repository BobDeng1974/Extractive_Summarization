@entity0 said he would not allow @entity2 's party to insist on a deal that would see @entity5 benefit at the expense of @entity7 @entity0 has ruled out any post-election pact with the @entity9 that would put @entity5 ahead of @entity7 - insisting it would be a ' betrayal of the @entity7 vote			1
' the shadow chancellor said he was ' unequivocal ' that he would not allow @entity2 's party to dictate a deal at @entity7 's expense			1
@entity14 has insisted @entity15 will not form a coalition with the @entity9 but has so far stopped short of dismissing a looser arrangement that could prop up a @entity15 administration			1
mr @entity0 told @entity19 's @entity21 newspaper : ' on the @entity9 point , there is absolutely no possibility of any vote being put to parliament or any budget measure in a @entity15 budget which would in any way disadvantage the @entity30 or any other part of @entity7 , because that 's what the @entity9 demand			1
i 'm not going to do it and @entity15 wo n't do it			0
we 've been very clear we wo n't have a coalition with the @entity9 and the reason is that the @entity9 - they ca n't stand up for the interests of people in @entity7 because they want to break up the @entity44			2
' he went on : ' now , we will put a vote to parliament to abolish the bedroom tax			0
i want a @entity15 majority to get that through			0
if the @entity9 decided to vote against it , that 's up to them			0
' but the idea that we would ever be in a position where the @entity9 come along and say , " we want you to advantage @entity5 against the @entity30 in return - in order to win our support " , that would be a betrayal of these constituencies here in the @entity60 and the @entity30 , it would be a betrayal of the @entity7 vote and we will not do it			2
' yesterday , it was revealed that more than half of @entity5 plan to back the @entity9 in the general election , shattering @entity14 's hopes of securing a @entity15 majority			2
@entity2 has been buoyed by a series of tv debates opposing austerity cuts , despite threatening another referendum on independence			0
a @entity74 survey shows the @entity9 has almost doubled its lead over @entity15 in a month , with 52 per cent now backing ms @entity2 with only 24 per cent of @entity5 planning to vote for mr @entity14			1
the @entity5 nationalists ’ surge in the polls comes amid signs of a split between @entity15 leadership in @entity82 and @entity83 , the @entity84 in @entity5			0
mr @entity83 has suggested that the party would not need to make ‘ further cuts to achieve our spending rules ’ in the next parliament			0
