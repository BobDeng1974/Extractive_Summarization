@entity1 coach @entity0 called for the game to provide better support for the second tier of international rugby league after watching his side narrowly miss out on the 2014 @entity8 title			1
@entity0 was able to call on just two @entity10 players , @entity11 and @entity12 , but the @entity13 ended the tournament with two wins out of three , losing only to eventual champions @entity17			1
the @entity18 , who went into the final match needing to beat @entity21 by 41 points in @entity23 , were leading by 36 and pressing the home line with three minutes to go only for @entity27 full - back @entity25 to gather a loose ball and sprint the full length of the pitch to score at the other end			1
@entity32 of @entity1 ( right ) puts in a challenge on @entity34 of @entity8 winners @entity17 @entity1 were in no mood to celebrate a 46 - 14 victory , which gifted the title to @entity17 on the back of a superior points difference , but @entity0 could not have been more proud of his players ' efforts			1
' i 've never been in a changing room like that , ' said @entity0 , whose side miss out on a place in the 2016 @entity48 as a well as automatic qualification for the @entity50			1
the boys have been outstanding for the last three weeks			2
' we 've thrown them together and they 've grown			2
' there 's no prouder bloke anywhere than me right now			0
we 've had a massive tournament and finished joint top having gone within a few seconds of winning it			0
' as much as it hurts now , we 've got to learn from it			0
that 's what 's great about sport , you can bounce back and next year we will bounce back			0
@entity65 ( centre ) of @entity1 is stopped in his tracks and tackled by @entity17 player @entity68 ' hopefully more people will start believing in international sport because it is the pinnacle of the sport and i think it 's disrespected at a lot of levels			1
' we need to get the game as a whole behind this tournament and players have got to play			0
it drives me insane that players do n't put their hands up to play at this level and clubs do n't support it			2
' winger @entity85 , who plays for amateur club @entity86 's , scored a hat - trick of tries on his international debut , while at the other end of the age scale , @entity91 's veteran scrum - half @entity11 ran the show on his return from injury and contributed 18 points with a try and seven goals			1
' we got the massive boost of @entity11 being available and massive thanks go to @entity91 and @entity102 , a close friend of mine , for believing in us , ' @entity0 added			1
' he said if it was n't a realistic target we 'd probably be smarter not playing him			0
to go to the last play with a chance to make history is a credit to the guys			0
' @entity21 ended the tournament with the wooden spoon after saving their worst performance for last but coach @entity114 took encouragement from his team 's second - half fightback after they trailed 28 - 0			1
@entity119 of @entity120 tries to gold off challenges from @entity123 ( left ) and @entity124 of @entity1 ' we 've got a young and inexperienced team and i think there was a great example of that today , ' @entity114 said			2
' there was a lack of urgency , desire and determination in the first half which really surprised me because i thought we had turned a corner in @entity138 last week			0
' i would say we were soft and dumb but the second half was much improved			0
it was three tries apiece in the second half which was more like it			0
