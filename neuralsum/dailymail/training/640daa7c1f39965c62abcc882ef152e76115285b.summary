commons deputy speaker @entity0 has withdrawn from this week ’s @entity1 debates as he fights what he yesterday described as ‘ completely false ’ rape claims			1
the senior @entity4 spoke of his ‘ incredulity ’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘ regarded as friends ’			1
mr @entity0 , 55 , who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip , said he had just endured ‘ the worst 24 hours of my life ’			1
after being released on bail , he vehemently denied the accusations , revealing that the men knew each other and that he had ‘ continued to socialise with one as recently as last week ’			2
deputy speaker @entity0 was spoken to about ' inappropriate sexual behaviour ' four years ago , according to reports mr @entity0 , conservative mp for @entity18 , today said that he had considered the two men who made the recent allegations against him to be ' friends ' mr @entity0 had what appeared to be a gash on his forehead which aides asked a television make - up artist to try to conceal before he made his statement			1
the injury was not evident in pictures taken of him on thursday night when he was out in @entity29 with former @entity31 mp @entity30			0
news of saturday ’s arrest at the constituency home of the popular mp for the @entity18 in @entity37 came as a huge shock to colleagues at @entity40 , many of whom spoke out in his support			2
mr @entity0 has insisted he would not be stepping down from his high - profile position as one of @entity47 ’s deputies or as an mp			1
however , after defence secretary @entity49 said it would be difficult for him to continue in such a ‘ sensitive ’ role while police continue to investigate the allegations , it emerged that he had asked to be excused from his ceremonial duties following wednesday ’s state opening of parliament			0
instead of mr @entity0 chairing any commons debates on the @entity1 in the absence of mr @entity47 , that role will be performed by his fellow deputies , @entity61 and @entity62 , commons sources said last night			2
the decision means mr @entity0 is unlikely to take the speaker ’s chair for at least a fortnight – giving all sides time to consider whether he can continue to carry out his duties while under police investigation			2
deputy house speaker @entity0 said in his statement that he had socialised with one of his accusers as recently as last week close up : mr @entity0 appeared to have covered up a scar on his forehead with make - up when he addressed the press outside his home today it was on saturday morning that mr @entity0 was arrested at his home in the idyllic village of @entity80 , near @entity81			1
he has owned the £ 250,000 two - bedroom terrace cottage – which has a small @entity84 portcullis on its wooden nameplate – for 15 years			0
@entity37 police – who did not name him to the media – said they were investigating allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another , both in their 20s , in @entity80 between 2009 and march this year			1
officers spent the day searching his @entity94 and @entity95 homes as well as his car , a white @entity98 convertible parked in the village			0
he was released on bail on saturday night , shortly afterwards saying on @entity101 : ‘ thanks for the amazing overwhelming support at this difficult time			0
’ yesterday he issued a strongly worded statement in the beer garden of the @entity109 award - winning @entity107 with two @entity111 pub next to his home			0
‘ yesterday i was interviewed by the police concerning complaints made by two people who are well known to each other and who until yesterday i regarded as friends , ’ he said			2
' incredulity ' : mr @entity0 said he could not understand why the ' completely false ' accusations had been made support : the deputy house speaker @entity0 thanked his colleagues , friends and members of the public for their support denial : mr @entity0 said the allegations against him were ' completely false ' ‘ the allegations are completely false and i ca n’t understand why they have been made , especially as i have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week			1
‘ i appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner , and i ’d like to thank my colleagues , friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events			0
’ a few minutes earlier a tv crew worker had applied make - up to his forehead in an attempt to conceal what appeared to be a large blue - tinged cut			1
mr @entity0 – said to be ‘ very shaken up ’ by his arrest – refused to answer questions except answering ‘ ok ’ when asked how he felt			0
after a lunchtime drink at the pub , mr @entity0 said that ‘ notwithstanding the death of my mum , and the loss of my brother very recently ’ , he had endured ‘ the worst 24 hours of my life ’			0
in 2009 the @entity154 told how the mp had spoken of ‘ shocking ’ failures at @entity156 in @entity157 following the death of his 86 - year - old mother from the superbug @entity160			1
going home : @entity0 was last night driven from @entity164 police station after questioning by detectives thorough : officers search the mp 's white @entity98 convertible parked in his home village of @entity80 in @entity37 @entity169 : this image shows mr @entity0 ' village in @entity80			2
his white @entity98 is pictured to the left of the stream in the distance on patrol : @entity95 police officers maintain their presence in the village mr @entity0 said yesterday he had been ‘ bolstered ’ by the ‘ amazing , overwhelming support ’ he had received , both from residents of his ‘ biscuit - tin - picture - like village ’ but also ‘ phenomenal ’ backing on @entity101			2
in addition to online support , mr @entity0 was backed by family , neighbours and political colleagues			0
his 49 - year - old sister , @entity188 , who took over their father ’s newsagent ’s business in @entity157 after his death , said : ‘ the family love him to death and we ’re 100 per cent behind him			1
’ his local @entity196 released a statement saying : ‘ in our democracy everyone accused is innocent until proven guilty and therefore unless @entity0 chooses himself to cease to be our mp or the electorate vote him out or justice system intervenes , we expect him to continue as normal to fulfil his duties in representing the people of the @entity18			1
’ arrested : @entity0 is pictured with @entity204 , who has been informed about the claims quizzed : mr @entity0 is pictured posing with two dancers @entity207 , @entity4 mp for @entity208 and a friend of mr @entity0 , said he had been ‘ deeply disturbed and shocked ’ at his arrest			1
‘ i know him to be caring , compassionate , and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person , ’ he said			0
@entity214 @entity4 mp @entity213 , who was accused of a sex assault two years ago only for police to drop their inquiries six days later , also said mr @entity0 should continue			2
earlier , however , mr @entity49 told @entity220 ’s @entity219 that while he stuck ‘ rigidly ’ to the principle of innocent until proven guilty , ‘ it is quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high - profile role while being under this kind of scrutiny ’			0
@entity4 sources stressed that , as deputy speaker , mr @entity0 does not technically take the conservative whip , so the question of it being withdrawn does not arise			0
the high - profile arrest will fuel the debate over whether anonymity should be granted to those suspected but not charged over sex offences			0
former metropolitan police commissioner lord @entity236 told @entity237 that while it was ‘ a real problem , i think the names have to be given ’			0
