' my auntie was cooking a barbecue on thursday night and my dad did n't make it home			0
there are only two police officers on the island of @entity20 , and none on @entity3 which has a population of just 64 ' it 's not like him to miss any event - especially when there 's hot meat on the table			1
' as police presence on the island is so small , the family is becoming increasingly anxious			0
estate agent @entity34 added : ' there 's only two police officers on @entity20 , so i 'm not even sure if they regularly go over to the smaller island			2
' the police over there could be out of their depth and it could mean we as a family paying for a helicopter			0
' i 've been racking my brains about what could have happened since @entity40 went missing			0
