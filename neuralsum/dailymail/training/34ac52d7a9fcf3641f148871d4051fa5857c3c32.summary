the scandal - hit @entity5 trust will be dissolved and critical care , maternity and paediatric services at cut under health administrators ' proposals			1
the hospital will keep its current part - time @entity31 department the recommendations , which will now be subject to public consultation , mean @entity5 's @entity31 department - which shuts between 10pm and 8am - has escaped the cuts			1
however , major emergency surgery and most trauma care , neonatal services and paediatric inpatient services , with the exception of its assessment unit , would all be moved to other hospitals in the region			1
