the blue touchpaper for friday night 's @entity2 opener has been lit after @entity3 were accused of illegal and underhand tactics			1
@entity6 ’s side were forced to defend themselves after claims by @entity8 , the @entity9 defence coach , that they use rugby league - style attacking moves to intentionally obstruct opposition defenders			1
the issue was raised at thursday night 's refereeing meeting in @entity14 , and shortly after @entity3 assistant coach @entity15 strongly refuted the allegations of dirty tricks			1
@entity9 defence coach @entity8 has accused @entity3 of using illegal and underhand tactics @entity18 runs with the ball during the @entity3 captain 's run at the @entity22 on thursday @entity15 , pictured with fly - half @entity23 , has defended the tactics and says there 's nothing illegal ‘ if @entity8 ’s concerned about it , then he ’s got it out there , ’ said @entity15			1
‘ probably everyone in world rugby does what we do , so i do n’t know what his concern is			2
there ’s nothing illegal about it			2
every team runs those sorts of shapes			2
i do n’t know why @entity9 do n’t do it			1
‘ they do ! @entity45			2
unless you ’re running into a player , i do n’t think you ’re obstructing			0
if you go in between two players , that ’s not obstruction			0
i ’m sure he knows the rules			0
’ @entity8 , 48 , played rugby league for @entity52 and @entity53			1
the timing of his comments , on the eve of the big kick - off at the @entity22 , will no doubt stir the pot ahead of an already emotionally charged fixture			2
@entity8 is a former @entity60 player and was also a coach with the @entity62 @entity9 players warm up as they prepare to face @entity3 in the @entity2 opener on friday night @entity8 ’s concerns surround the use of blocking runners to take out tacklers without the ball , subsequently creating an overlap for the attacking team			1
‘ i ’ve studied @entity3 ’s play a lot with @entity73 , the @entity74 coach , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ he agreed with me that @entity3 use a style of play that is similar to the way we used to play with @entity52 ( alongside @entity3 backs coach @entity80 )			1
‘ they try and get you to number up wrong on the left or right post , with the trigger being the full back ( @entity87 ) who decides which way the attack should go			0
‘ they will come at you with what we call “ league plays ” with that ball out the back			0
‘ it ’s important that we get our structures right and it is also important there is no obstruction of our defensive players ahead of the ball			0
‘ a lot of tries are disallowed in rugby league because of that			0
i ’m sure the referees and television match officials will be well aware of that			0
it is a risk to do a lot of those rugby league plays because of the obstruction rule			0
’ @entity8 says that the tactics used by @entity3 are similar to those of @entity60 side @entity52 @entity117 passes the ball as @entity3 players warm up at the @entity22 @entity9 captain @entity120 ( right ) enters the stadium with coach @entity122 in the build - up to friday night 's fixtures , all of the verbal attacks have been triggered by the @entity128 camp			1
there has been no shortage of confidence from @entity122 ’s team , who have a clean bill of health and are odds - on favourites for friday night 's meeting in @entity14			1
wales boast 448 caps in their starting xv compared to 358 in @entity3 ’s ; however , @entity141 coach @entity6 is not concerned about carrying the underdog tag			2
‘ the odds are irrelevant to me , ’ said @entity6			0
‘ we played pretty much the same @entity128 team last year and we 100 per cent respect that they have @entity62			0
‘ but equally we have confidence and belief that we can do the job , because if we do n’t believe that , we ’ll have no chance			0
we definitely believe we can go there and win			0
’ the last time @entity3 visited the @entity22 they lost 30 - 3 to the @entity128			1
