@entity34 , prosecuting , said that @entity15 called her gp surgery at 8.47am and told the receptionist her son was not breathing			1
the receptionist advised her to call 999 immediately			2
' she did not do that , ' miss @entity38 said			0
' the next clear point in time is 9.25am when we know that @entity15 called 999			2
' there was a delay of about 38 minutes between her calling the gp surgery and calling 999			2
' the charge of neglect is her failure to seek medical help during the 38 minutes between the calls			0
' miss @entity38 said that @entity12 , who was described before his death as thriving , healthy and a quite normal baby , would have been very unwell immediately after he was allegedly shaken , causing bleeding called a subdural haematoma			0
she told the jury that there was a ' golden hour ' where aggressive intervention could have helped @entity59 , but that the damage may have already been enough for him not to survive			0
the barrister explained said that @entity12 had other ' crucial injuries ' including fractures to both his legs and one arm and injuries to the back of his eyes that she claimed were caused by @entity0 when he shook him			1
' @entity72 say that @entity0 must have lost his temper with him ( @entity59 ) and shook him in temper , only briefly , and that is what caused the injury to his brain , ' miss @entity38 said			2

@entity0 denied any assault and said his son was fine but he had been crying that morning and had a big sneeze just before he became ill. he said that after the call to the gp surgery he became responsive again , flinging his arms around , and they thought he was fine			2
he said that @entity15 went upstairs to get dressed as she was going to take him to the doctors but he collapsed again			0
@entity15 had , in effect , given the same account , miss @entity38 said			0
but the barrister told the jury that the force used to inflict the injuries ' was beyond any normal or even rough handling ' and that there was not medical evidence that a sneeze could cause such an injury			0
the trial of the pair , both formerly of @entity107 , @entity108 , but now living in @entity109 , west @entity110 , is expected to last three weeks			0
