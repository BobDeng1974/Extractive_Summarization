however , a 28 - year - old woman from @entity7 has struck a blow for her @entity10 sisters after becoming a train driver for the city 's @entity13 system			1
not only is @entity15 the first female in the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) to get behind the controls of a train - she is also the first in the @entity20			1

the network , which is described as the most advanced in the world is primarily an unmanned automatic driving system , which is operated from a centralised control room			1
however , in the event of system repairs or an accident , it needs manual operation			1
miss @entity15 told @entity51 : ' i am always open to challenges and i am not afraid to take risks			1
i work hard and my job is my top priority			1
' she added : ' being a train attendant has helped me understand how to interact with people and staff from different nationalities and different cultures			1

' @entity7 's large expatriate community accounts for 80 per cent of its citizens , making @entity36 minorities in their own country , so jobs like miss @entity35 's are usually carried out by foreign nationals			2
however , in a bid to reduce the @entity16 's reliance on foreign labour and expertise , the government is introducing policies to boost the number of @entity36 in the workforce			2
the @entity77 said it actively promotes the policy of employing of local @entity36 and claimed the number of locals working for @entity107 - the operator of the system - is almost 135 , which is 12 per cent of the total workforce			2
the process of ' emiratisation ' is to be increased to push up this number to between 50 and 60 per cent by the end of 2014			0

the 2006 law banning men from working in female apparel and cosmetic stores has never been put into effect			1
this is partly because of the stance of hard - liners in the religious establishment , who oppose the whole idea of women working where men and women congregate together , like malls			0
