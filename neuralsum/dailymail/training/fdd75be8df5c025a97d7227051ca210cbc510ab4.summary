by @entity0 @entity1 has hailed @entity2 as the second - best player of his generation only bettered by @entity5 following the @entity8 midfielder 's decision to retire from @entity10 duty			1
@entity1 - who played with @entity2 in @entity8 's first team for six years - believes the 34 - year - old can hold his head high after 114 caps and 21 goals for the @entity10 during a 14 - year stint			1
he told @entity17 : ' in my career i was fortunate to have played alongside some of the greatest footballers of my generation and the biggest compliment i can pay to @entity24 is that in my opinion he is second only to @entity26 in terms of world - class status			0
celebrations : @entity1 wheels away in delight with @entity2 after scoring for @entity10 quality : the duo formed a great partnership during their time together at @entity8 ' rather like when i was considering hanging up my boots , you go through all the pros and cons of staying or going and you consider all the personal and professional hopes and dreams that you ’ve held on to for so many years			1
' ultimately you have to make a decision that you feel most comfortable with and one that you hope will be in the best interests of everyone who is likely to affected			0
all smiles : @entity2 and @entity1 celebrate @entity48 success in 2001 at the @entity49 in @entity50 ' in @entity24 ’s case he obviously feels that it ’s time for the younger generation to step forward and quite literally fill his boots at international level			1
' having reached that decision we can only admire his conviction and congratulate him on an international career to be proud of			2
' of course he will have wanted the team to have achieved more at the six major tournaments that he played in , but with 114 caps and 21 goals to his name , not to mention captaining his country on 38 occasions he can be very proud of his achievements			0
' @entity1 , who himself made 89 appearances for @entity10 , saw he knew instantly when first saw @entity2 play that he was all set to become a star , later forming a formidable partnership with the midfielder at @entity72			1
' the first time i saw @entity24 play , as an 11 - year - old in the @entity8 youth ranks , it was obvious how much ability he possessed and that in all probability he would become the complete , modern footballer			1
' i first met @entity24 at @entity8 ’s training ground in 1992 when we were on our way through the club ’s youth ranks and in those days there was no standing on ceremony when judging talent			0
' the @entity8 coaches quite openly put the best players in the same team and as we were considered two of the brightest prospects we ’d always be paired together			0
memorable : @entity2 scores his first goal for his country in the historic 5 - 1 win over @entity98 in @entity99 walking away : @entity2 has called time on a 14 - year international career with @entity10 ' i knew very quickly that i was playing alongside someone special			1
there was n’t a particular moment of realisation as such			0
' with me , i would make a forward run and @entity24 would just keep delivering the ball right into my path			0
that ’s how it was with us for the next 20 years at @entity8 and then with @entity10			2
no - one created more goals for me			0
' the retired forward also hopes @entity2 's decision to call time on his international career will bring him more success domestically , with the @entity119 crown a trophy @entity2 is still desperate to add to his collection			1
he added : ' i believe that @entity24 ’s decision to stand down from international duty has in no small part been made with a view to prolonging his career at @entity8			2
' despite @entity10 ’s lack of success during his time with them i for one hope that he can add to his already impressive haul with @entity8 by lifting the one piece of domestic silverware that has eluded him thus far			2

@entity1 believes @entity2 was the second - best player of his generation , only bettered by @entity5 , following his retirement with @entity10
the former @entity8 and @entity10 *striker* says @entity2 can hold his head high after 14 - year international career comes to an end
the duo formed an impressive partnership for both club and country
