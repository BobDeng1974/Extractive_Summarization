a gun enthusiast from @entity1 who was attending an @entity4 - style boot camp drove all the way to the @entity6 with a car full of lethal weapons - and was n't stopped by a single official			1
@entity10 boarded a ferry in @entity12 while his car was loaded with an arsenal of weapons , including a rifle , two semi-automatic guns and 280 rounds of ammunition			1
the 23 - year - old had enrolled on a ' close protection ' course in the @entity24 national park , where the most lethal weapon due to be used was a rubber knife			1
but he decided to bring along his own huge collection of weapons - and managed to drive all the way to @entity30 with them in tow			2
@entity10 , 23 , boarded a ferry in @entity12 while his car was loaded with an arsenal of weapons , including a rifle , two semi-automatic guns and 280 rounds of ammunition - but his car was not checked by officials a judge at @entity40 today said there had been a ' gaping hole ' in security that allowed @entity10 to carry out his journey			1
the court heard @entity10 had declared his boot - full of weapons to officials on the @entity50 border - but had been waved onto the ferry without his car being inspected			1
officials failed to pass the message about his stash on to @entity55 authorities , meaning no one ever checked inside @entity10 's car			1
the young man only found himself being arrested when two fellow course goers reported him to the instructor after he boasted to them about his extensive collection			0
the arsenal included a @entity64 aug semi automatic .223 rifle , a semi automatic @entity68 .9mm pistol , knives , a tomahawk , extendable baton , gas mask , body armour and balaclavas			0
speaking at @entity40 , judge @entity75 said : ' the facts are serious and worrying			0
if everything had worked properly that information should have been relayed to the @entity55			0
' he was not stopped or questioned in anyway by the @entity55 authorities			0
the real issue that disturbs me is that no - one appears to think that someone should have done something			0
i hope that something can be done about it			0
' @entity10 appeared at the court for sentencing after admitting nine offences of possessing illegal weapons			1
during the hearing , the court heard @entity10 , who had hoped to work in personal security in @entity95 or @entity96 , enrolled on the £ 4,200 close protection and hostile environment operation course run by the @entity99			1
the @entity99 told @entity10 to bring with him necessary equipment such as warm and wet weather clothing			2
but @entity10 decided to take along part of his personal collection of weapons			2
@entity105 , prosecuting , said that had @entity10 successfully applied in @entity1 for a @entity106 , which would supposedly allow him to take guns into the @entity55			2
@entity10 was attending a £ 4,200 survival course in the @entity6 , mid @entity24 ( pictured ) when his fellow course - goers grew concerned about his extensive weapon collection but mr @entity105 said that in fact the pass did not override the laws of individual countries and that guns and ammunition were ' definitely illegal ' in the @entity55			1
he told the court that @entity10 had informed border officials about the arms in the boot of his car when he arrived in @entity12			1
he was then told to wait until a member of the @entity50 forces spoke to him and inspected the guns , but the official did not turn up			2
a representative of the @entity50 - owned firm myferrylink then told him to drive on to the boat , lock his car and give the keys to a crew member			1
as the ship neared @entity132 , @entity10 went back to his car , where he was given his keys back and told to ' drive on '			1
mr @entity105 said myferrylink had by then placed a ' code 100 ' mark on @entity10 's travel details , flagging up the contents of his car to the authorities			2
the consequences should have been that the @entity50 security forces at least spoke to @entity10 and told the @entity55 he was on his way , he added			1
but in @entity132 , @entity10 drove through the green ' nothing to declare ' corridor without being stopped			1
judge @entity75 at @entity40 ( pictured ) said there had been a ' gaping hole ' in border security he then drove onto @entity148 , a village at the foot of the @entity6 300 miles away			1
there he was booked into the coach @entity153 hotel , where he met fellow course goers @entity155 and @entity157			0
mr @entity105 told the court : ' they were surprised to discover he had brought with him an arsenal of weapons , ammunition and body armour			2
he made no secret about what he had , and even laid it all out in his bedroom for them to see			0
' the two men , both ex-forces , became uneasy and told the instructor about the weapons , who called the police			2
@entity10 was sentenced to 18 months ' jail , suspended for two years , after telling mr @entity75 he planned to return to @entity1 as soon as possible			0
the judge told @entity10 he accepted that he had ' declared the weapons to the @entity50 border authority and the ferry company '			1
he also said he believed he had taken ' all reasonable steps to find out if he could bring the weapons into the @entity55 '			0
@entity10 's guns , ammunition , knives , tomahawk and baton were confiscated			0
he also lost his £ 4,200 course fee , and was ordered to pay a £ 100 government surcharge			0
a spokesman for myferrylink said after the case : ' a code 100 is a standard code used by all ferry companies to indicate there are firearms aboard a vehicle			0
it is for the authorities to take notice if they want to			0
' a spokesman for the @entity200 said it was the responsibility of the person importing the firearms into the country to notify the relevant authority .			0
