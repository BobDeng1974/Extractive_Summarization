@entity1 should drop his pledge to reduce net migration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ ahead of the election , senior @entity0 say			1
the prime minister had promised to get the figure below 100,000 – ‘ no ifs , no buts ’ – four years ago			1
last week , however , the number moving to @entity11 exceeded the number leaving by a record margin of nearly 300,000			1
the issue has caused divisions at the top of the @entity30 with health secretary @entity31 , communities secretary @entity32 and chancellor @entity33 reportedly expressing their doubts			2
a friend of mr @entity33 said his ‘ instincts are very different ’ from mr @entity1 ’s			2
@entity38 , who has served as a minister under mr @entity1 , said the entire pledge had been a mistake			1
‘ we will have to drop the target , ’ he told the @entity43 newspaper			2
‘ it would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely			0
‘ i ’m afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake			1
’ @entity51 , the former foreign office minister , warned that the failure to meet the target risked undermining the @entity30 ’ wider credibility			0
‘ if you set yourself unrealistic targets you are setting yourself up to fail and , in the long term , turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the government ca n’t get a grip , ’ she said			0
dropping the target will fuel the feeling among @entity65 backbenchers that the only way to cut immigration is to leave the @entity68			0
mr @entity1 has acknowledged that the reason immigrants want to come to @entity11 is because of the recovering economy and strong prospects of work			1
he has spoken of the need for reform of free movement rules in the @entity68 , but the leaders of other member states , particularly @entity80 ’s @entity79 , have made it clear they will not budge on this point			0
former minister @entity38 has said that the entire migration pledge has been a mistake and not possible to achieve without damaging the country 's economy the latest figures , which put net migration at 298,000 for the year ending in last september , would have exceeded 100,000 even without immigration from within @entity90			1
polls suggest the public are increasingly concerned about levels of immigration , which has fuelled support for @entity95			0
the latest @entity97 survey suggests 75 per cent of voters think the numbers coming in are too high			0
a former strategist in @entity101 told the @entity43 that the prime minister was exasperated with the dissent over his policy , saying : ‘ why on earth are the only people who are really committed to our policy me and @entity22 ? ’ last week @entity109 said mr @entity1 was ‘ disappointed ’ with the latest figures			2
immigration minister @entity110 said : ‘ uncontrolled , mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion , puts pressure on public services and can force down wages			0
‘ that ’s why this government is working to reduce net migration			1
’ when mr @entity1 entered @entity101 in may 2010 net migration was running at 244,000			1
the 298,000 figure has been surpassed only once , in 2005			0
the majority of @entity68 migrants now come from @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 , which all have moribund economies and high youth unemployment .			0
