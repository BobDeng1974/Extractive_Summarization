the tragedy in @entity8 , a remote village which is three miles from the nearest paved road , first came to light in august last year when a pregnant woman showed positive for @entity2 during a routine test			1
medics were unable to explain the infection , but after another expectant mother also tested positive a few weeks later , medical centres were inundated with villagers asking to be screened			2
at the time the country 's prime minister refused to accept the results as genuine , saying he was ' 100 per cent ' sure it was not @entity2			0
but he was to be proved tragically wrong			0
more positive results flooded in and the centres were filled with people weeping and hugging each other , reports the @entity58			2
