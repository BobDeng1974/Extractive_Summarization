in a statement on the site @entity51 , the group of hackers said : ' this information was acquired through the recently patched @entity10 exploit and is being shared with the public to raise awareness on the issue			2

' the group said it would consider releasing the original database , without the redacted digits , ' under certain circumstances '			1
