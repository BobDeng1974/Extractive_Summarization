the potential domestic auction for @entity2 's @entity1 this summer could decide which of @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity7 lure @entity5 from @entity8			1
as first revealed in @entity9 last month , @entity2 have put a £ 50million price tag on @entity1 if they opt to sell the 20 - year - old			1
should @entity1 leave for one of the @entity13 's big three , then the other two will focus on trying to persuade @entity5 to leave @entity8			1
a potential domestic auction could be sparked for the purchase of @entity2 's @entity1 @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity7 are among those watching @entity18 ahead of the summer it could decide where @entity5 ends up if one club gets @entity1 and the other two miss out it promises to become a tangled transfer web			1
@entity5 is , from a playing and commercial point of view , a far ' safer bet ' given his proven cv			0
but his fee of £ 75m and near £ 300,000 - a - week wages mean his acquisition would restrict other signings under financial fair play guidelines			0
it 's also the case that @entity5 may not agree to a return to any of the three @entity13 clubs who can afford him			1
indeed he has indicated he would like to continue at @entity8			0
but such has been the adverse reaction of many @entity8 fans to him this season he may find it difficult to ' tough it out '			0
and the @entity40 club may feel it is a good time to ' cash out '			0
as it stands @entity2 will not budge from their £ 100,000 - a - week contract offer to @entity45 international @entity18 , whose advisors believe he is worth about £ 150,000 in the current market			2
@entity2 will not budge from their £ 100,000 - a - week contract offer to @entity18 @entity5 ( left ) pictured during a @entity8 training session with @entity52 superstar @entity51 @entity5 's £ 75m fee and near £ 300,000 - a - week wages mean his signing would restrict clubs under @entity58 guidelines the stance of the @entity2 hierarchy , though , is they will not scrap their salary ladder scale for @entity18 in the belief he has not yet justified moving up to their existing top bracket of £ 140,000 - a - week that departing @entity66 has been on or @entity67 pocketed before leaving for @entity68			1
given that he has two years left on his existing £ 35,000 - a - week contract , the club feel if @entity1 will not agree they should cash in , even if means selling to one of the rivals - even @entity7			2
@entity75 @entity74 , dubbed by @entity77 president @entity76 as ' the new @entity78 ' , is set to be on his way to the @entity13 this summer			1
the destination depends on the outcome of the @entity18 saga but both @entity2 and @entity83 are in for the 21 - year - old			1
@entity74 , dubbed ' the new @entity78 ' , is set to be on his way to the @entity13 the destination depends on the outcome of the @entity18 saga but both @entity2 and @entity83 fancy him the 21 - year - old currently plays for @entity77 in @entity88 but could be on his way to @entity45 this summer @entity2 have been strongly linked with a move for @entity83 's @entity91 but the player 's wage demands may put off the @entity95 outfit			1
@entity91 signed a near £ 100,000 - a - week deal with the @entity97 just two years ago but is already seeking improved terms to commit himself to the club for a further five years			2
it remains to be seen whether @entity83 are prepared to up his wages again given his appearance record over the past two years which has been hampered by more injuries			0
@entity2 have been strongly linked with a move for @entity83 's @entity91 during the summer @entity91 signed a near £ 100,000 - a - week deal with the @entity97 just two years ago but could leave @entity108 @entity2 manager @entity109 would see @entity91 as an ideal replacement for @entity1 but would only want to pay about the £ 100,000 - per - week mark			1
if @entity91 was still attracted to a move to @entity95 , where he would command more regular football , then @entity112 would make a move for @entity116			0
if @entity1 goes and @entity91 stays with the @entity97 , @entity2 could then move in for the highly - rated @entity116			1
he is a centre forward who can also operate on the wing and is currently valued in the £ 15m bracket			0
@entity121 has emerged as one of the front runners to succeed @entity124 as @entity126 manager			1
if , as seems certain , the @entity126 do not give @entity124 a new contract in the summer then the club could turn to @entity129 , currently in charge of @entity131 , who lie third in the @entity134 league in touching distance of leaders @entity137			2
@entity121 has an impressive cv having managed the national teams of both @entity140 and @entity141			0
@entity121 could join the @entity13 if he replaces @entity126 manager @entity124 @entity121 and @entity142 relax before @entity140 's ill - fated 2002 @entity144 campaign among the clubs he has managed include @entity147 in @entity40 , where he earned a reputation of promoting exciting football in a 3 - 3 - 3 - 1 formation			1
he is regarded as a progressive attacking coach with both @entity152 and @entity153 influenced by the 59 - year - old			0
but the appointment of @entity121 would still be a gamble by @entity126			2
@entity124 may not be handed a new contract during the summer by @entity126 when his current deal expires @entity121 could replace @entity124 if his current contract is not extended by @entity13 club @entity126 over the years he has earned the nickname @entity161 - ' the mad one '			1
his command of @entity163 is limited and he has little knowledge of the @entity13			0
the need for @entity126 not to even be close to a relegation battle in their last season at the @entity169 before moving to the @entity170 , is obvious			0
other contenders on @entity126 's long list include @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
once @entity7 have completed the long - mooted move for @entity180 from @entity181 at the end of the season , they will - as also predicted here - set their sights on @entity186 's right back @entity187			1
it has been suggested @entity7 will offer striker @entity189 , currently on loan at @entity8 , as part of the deal to land by @entity187			2
but @entity126 are also interested in signing @entity189			0
@entity7 will set their sights on @entity186 's right back @entity187 this summer @entity7 are set to complete their highly anticipated move for @entity180 from @entity181 @entity3 are set to move in for @entity195 goalkeeper @entity194 to act as no 2 to @entity196 with @entity197 on his way out of @entity199			1
@entity83 and @entity2 have been linked with @entity197			2
@entity3 would prefer to sell £ 10m - rated @entity197 abroad			2
@entity8 or @entity200 are likely to be in the market			0
@entity3 are set to move in for @entity195 goalkeeper @entity194 to replace @entity197 at @entity199 i am hearing while on @entity45 duty @entity1 was urged by several around the camp to take a step back and consider the potential downsides of leaving @entity2 at this stage of his career , even if he will land bigger wages for the time being			1
i hear it was even put to @entity18 that the saga now unfolding is more in the short - term interest of his advisor @entity216 than his long - term progression as a player			2
indeed the @entity2 player should look at what happened to @entity221 a decade ago			0
@entity1 was reportedly urged by people in the @entity45 camp to sit back and think before leaving @entity95 it was in 2005 that @entity221 left @entity4 - before they were big time - for @entity3 in a £ 21m deal , which was massive at the time			1
at the time 23 - year - old @entity221 looked as though he could be a world beater			0
but he was never a regular at @entity4 and his hugely promising career both at club level and @entity45 never reached its potential			0
now at @entity195 , 33 - year - old @entity221 has made one @entity13 appearance this season			0
@entity221 left @entity4 for @entity3 in a £ 21m deal in 2005 but he never reached his potential i am also hearing the @entity236 , @entity13 and the @entity237 will seek medical advice as to the safety of vanishing spray for free kicks which has been banned in @entity243 's @entity242 on health grounds on the basis it is ' hormonally active '			1
@entity243 's @entity242 banned the vanishing spray on health grounds on the basis it is ' hormonally active '			0

@entity1 's potential move from @entity2 could spark a three - way domestic auction between @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity7
@entity2 have put a £ 50million price tag on @entity18
if one of the three @entity13 clubs sign @entity1 , then the other two will try to lure @entity5 from @entity8
@entity109 sees @entity91 as an ideal replacement for @entity1
@entity77 's @entity74 is a target of both @entity2 and @entity83
@entity121 could succeed @entity124 as @entity126 manager
@entity7 set sights on @entity186 right back @entity187
