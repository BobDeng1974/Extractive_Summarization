' and that should land me short of the flag and not have it either hit the flag or skip over the back			0
i felt that was going to be the right decision to take off four ( yards ) right there			0
' it was that statement that launched a firestorm of uproar , and on saturday led to a 2 - stroke penalty by the @entity51 committee			1
' he should really sit quietly with whoever he trusts , [ long - time agent ] @entity82 , a few others , maybe @entity4 [ @entity14 , his girlfriend ] as well , and sit and just go , " wow , i would be doing the manly thing to go , i have broken the rules of golf , " ' @entity32 told the @entity85 on saturday			1

not with intentionally not dropping as near as possible , ' tweeted @entity94 , a former @entity95 golfer			0
it was a television viewer who brought @entity5 ’ illegal drop on the 15th hole to officials ' attention , which would have been otherwise missed , according to a statement by @entity103			1
happier times : @entity4 with then husband @entity14			2
@entity4 and @entity5 announced they were dating recently and his play as markedly improved sunk : @entity5 reacts after the ball went into the water on the 15th hole , a trap that gave him three options to wiggle out of , one he 's said to have illegally performed while @entity5 was on the 18th hole , officials consequently reviewed footage of his drop before announcing their decision - a pardoning one			1
' the penalty of disqualification was waived by the @entity122 under @entity123 as the @entity122 had previously reviewed the information and made its initial determination prior to the finish of [ @entity5 ’ ] round , ' @entity118 , the committee 's chairman said			1
according to @entity138 33 - 7 : ‘ a penalty of disqualification may in exceptional individual cases be waived , modified or imposed if the committee such action warranted			1
if a @entity122 considers that a player is guilty of a serious breach of etiquette , it may impose a penalty of disqualification under this rule			1

leader : @entity144 of @entity145 , seen during the second round of the @entity147 , starts the third round on saturday 6 under on saturday , roughly an hour before teeing off , @entity5 released the following statement claiming he did n't realize he was so detrimentally far from his original place before taking that shot			1
‘ i did n’t know i had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard , ’ @entity5 tweeted			2
‘ subsequently , i met with the @entity122 saturday morning and was advised they had reviewed the incident prior to the completion of my round			0
' their initial determination was that there was no violation , but they had additional concerns based on my post-round interview			0
after discussing the situation with them this morning , i was assessed a two - shot penalty			1
i understand and accept the penalty and respect the @entity122 ' decision			2
' round three : woods , right , is seen putting on the practice green before the third round on saturday afternoon after assessed a 2 - stroke penalty by the rules committee for the drop on friday playing fair : woods , seen on saturday , started the year with a rules violation after taking relief from an imbedded lie in a sandy area covered with vines in @entity184 which was determined not allowed in the sand @entity178 will begin 5 strokes behind leader @entity144 on saturday afternoon , who 's 6 under			1
the revision to @entity123 was based upon the modern era of television			0
one example cited was @entity192 , who opened with a 65 in @entity184 at the start of the 2011 season			0
@entity192 was disqualified when a slow - motion replay on high - definition tv revealed that his ball moved ever so slightly after he replaced his marked			0
@entity192 did n't realize it had moved - a two - shot penalty - and was disqualified for an incorrect card			2
that same year , @entity201 was disqualified in @entity202 when a tv viewer noticed he tamped down a divot in an area where his chip was rolling back down a slope			0
