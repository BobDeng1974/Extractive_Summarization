barometer readings at @entity1 are destined to soar off the scale today , as @entity4 attempt to cope with stifling , intensifying pressure while standing in the path of a thunderous @entity8 juggernaut			1
national coach @entity9 , his assistants and players are painfully aware that the stakes are rising as they engage in the second instalment of their @entity15 autumn test series			1
saturday ’s encounter represents the edge of an abyss			2
a fifth successive defeat would leave @entity4 in freefall , just when they need to be building towards next year ’s @entity21			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity4 gather in a huddle as @entity24 ( right ) watches on at @entity1 on friday @entity25 ( centre ) runs with the ball during the @entity4 captain 's run ahead of the @entity31 match @entity4 players sprint during training at @entity1 ahead of saturday 's international @entity4 head coach @entity9 takes a seat as he watch the captain 's run on friday @entity38 it may be — given the calibre of the opposition during that period — but the worst losing run since 2006 would not convey the message that the tournament hosts are shaping up to mount a convincing challenge for the global prize			1
there has long been a tangible sense of progress and upward mobility , but this regime needs further endorsement in the shape of another landmark result			2
the management have been emphatically backed by their @entity57 employers , with contract extensions through to 2020 , but they all know that judgment will be passed on the strength of what happens in the next 11 months			0
@entity9 spoke this week of the pressure faced by the coaches , with every decision increasingly dissected and scrutinised			1
it is not just those four men who have to carry the burden , far from it , especially this week			2
in light of the allegations of homophobic abuse aimed at referee @entity73 last saturday , there will be pressure on the sell - out crowd to be vocal but respectful			1
and , following criticism by @entity79 coach @entity78 , there will be pressure on the hidden figures who edit footage for the stadium ’s big screen , to avoid any home bias with their use of replays			0
away from south west @entity91 , there will be pressure on officials from the @entity94 and @entity95 to confirm an agreement with their players to avert the threat of strike action disrupting next weekend ’s @entity100			0
and saturday ’s contest will bring intense pressure on the @entity31 too , after losing to @entity103			1
their proud heritage does not permit the luxury of repeated failure , even with experimental team selections			0
but the pressure will sit most heavily on @entity4 ’s players — those men left standing amid an injury crisis , who must earn the victory demanded to put the @entity115 back on a positive course			1
there are certain members of the @entity120 line - up particularly in need of an upturn in fortunes			2
after naming his team for saturday , @entity9 conceded that @entity4 ’s kicking game must improve after the problems in that area last week			1
@entity128 ( centre ) passes the ball during the @entity31 captain 's run on friday @entity133 ( centre ) passes the ball as the @entity31 prepare to face @entity4 at @entity1 @entity136 stretches on the @entity1 pitch during the @entity31 ' training session the @entity31 gather for a team photograph ahead of saturday 's autumn international so the onus is on @entity25 to rediscover the authority in his game after an injury - disrupted start to the season , while @entity146 must share the load and sharpen his execution in his 50th @entity4 match			1
there will be a different type of pressure on the pack as a unit			0
they must maintain the superb set - piece standards of last week — especially in their line - out work — as they will be tested to the limit by the wily @entity31 forwards			1
but in their breakdown work and ball - carrying , @entity4 must be several levels better , or they will be eclipsed and beaten			1
@entity9 has made it plain that two of his back - rowers are playing for their places			1
@entity167 has been a stalwart and influential presence in this regime , but the blindside flanker has been told to ‘ step up ’ or face the threat of being replaced by @entity172 , the in - form @entity173 captain			2
@entity175 8 @entity174 has also been given a warning that his starting status is in danger			0
@entity9 used both carrot and stick to make his point and the 22 - year - old has expressed his determination to be more forceful			1
reflecting on his low - key contribution against the @entity79 , @entity174 said : ‘ i felt that i did n’t impact the game as i would have wanted			2
i did n’t enforce my normal game			0
i felt i was quiet and i have definitely got to improve on that			0
i ’ve just got to impose myself like i do at the club , and be who i am rather than tiptoeing round everything			0
’ @entity146 kicks the ball upfield during @entity4 's training session on friday @entity174 looks on during an @entity4 media session at @entity193 earlier in the week having been brought up by his @entity195 family with an emphasis on respect and religion , @entity174 admitted he has to make character changes in order to improve as a player , adding : ‘ it is tough because it is not in our culture to say , “ look , @entity206 , i am doing this ”			1
you do n’t impose yourself			0
you wait until you are spoken to as a kid			0
‘ i ’m not still a kid , but sometimes i have got too much respect for older guys in the team			0
i said that to @entity9			1
i ’ve just got to get on with it and impose myself better and be like , “ give me the ball			0
i ’ll do my best with it ”			0
it is a lot to do with growing up fast			0
hopefully , i will be better on saturday			2
it is fair enough that people tell me i should be better			0
i know i ’ve got to be better			0
’ @entity174 is not alone in knowing that standards must be raised and maintained			0
@entity146 said : ‘ like @entity9 said , we need an extra 10 per cent from everyone — maybe 20 per cent			2
’ each home player will hope to deliver that personal improvement , in the knowledge that next week ’s clash with @entity229 will serve as a time for experimentation , which may leave them vulnerable in the longer term			2
and as a team , @entity4 must end an unacceptably long run of submission to @entity31 — 11 matches without a win — as the only way to lower the soaring barometer readings .			1

@entity4 take on @entity31 at @entity1 on saturday
@entity9 's side have suffered four successive defeats
