@entity0 will aim to put what rugby director @entity1 has described as an " unacceptable " performance behind them when they tackle @entity6 play - off opponents @entity7 on sunday			1
the seventh - placed @entity9 and @entity10 finishers clash in the first of two legs at @entity13			1
at stake is the 20th and final qualifying spot for next season 's inaugural tournament , which succeeds the @entity18			0
pick up the pieces : @entity20 attempts a pass during @entity0 ' crushing 74 - 13 defeat by @entity23 @entity0 ended their @entity9 campaign by suffering a crushing 74 - 13 defeat against title - chasing @entity23 last saturday , and @entity1 said : ' last weekend 's performance was unacceptable			1
' we were all incredibly disappointed , especially with the way we lacked fight when we went behind			0
' that performance certainly wo n't be brushed under the carpet , but the detailed post-mortem must wait until after these two games			2
' i think people will understand that we are not in a position where we can dwell on it too long			0
these two play - off games are huge for the club , the players and our supporters			1
' there has been a lot of hurt around the camp , so it may be the ideal time to go into this game			0
we 've all looked at where we need to improve , and i have been very pleased with the response players have shown in training			0
the intensity has been good , and now we need to translate that on to the pitch on sunday			0
' familiar face : @entity56 will line up against his former side when @entity0 take on @entity7 @entity1 welcomes back a number of players for @entity61 's visit as @entity0 look to take charge ahead of next saturday 's return encounter in @entity64			1
captain @entity65 and wing @entity66 are the only backs who remain following the @entity23 game , while six switches up - front see starts for @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and former @entity61 player @entity56			1
' defence normally gives an indication of the mindset of a team , and that mindset was n't right the last couple of games ( against @entity23 and @entity84 ) , given the way we leaked tries , ' @entity1 added			2
' certainly , up until those two games , our defence and attitude had been excellent , so we need to recapture that hunger and desire and produce the work - rate and attitude in defence to give ourselves a good chance			2
i am sure we will do that on sunday			0
