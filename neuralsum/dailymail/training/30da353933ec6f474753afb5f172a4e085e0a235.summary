his performance included humorous jibes at the groom 's ginger hair and even a suggestion that the bride was marrying her husband out of pity			1
the medley began with mr @entity46 's own version of @entity47 is on @entity48 by @entity49 , in which he replaced the lyrics with his ' hair is on fire ' - a dig at @entity9 's hair			1
he then broke into ' @entity58 ) ' by @entity59 , before subgubg ' @entity60 ' by @entity61 and ' @entity62 by ' @entity63			1
the it support engineer finished the medley with a version of @entity68 's @entity67 hit ' @entity69 '			2
the video shows the wedding guests embracing the performance with many laughing and clapping along as friend @entity73 , 31 , plays the guitar			2
the best man , from @entity14 , said : ' i 'd had about an year to plan this and i was going to do @entity78 with different words			1
' but then it got to a about a week before the wedding and i still had n't prepared anything			0
i decided i wanted to play songs with a guitar as well so i asked @entity73 to accompany me			2
' i made a list and showed him the songs on monday night and then wrote the lyrics between monday and thursday			1
he serenaded the couple 's friends and family with his own rendition of a medley of songs at the reception at @entity13 in @entity14 it began with his own version of @entity47 is on @entity48 by @entity49 and was followed by ' @entity96 ) ' by @entity59 , ' @entity60 ' by @entity61 and ' a @entity97 by ' @entity63 ' we had one chance to run through all the songs together and @entity9 did n't know a thing			1
' i had spent the early part of the wedding telling everyone i had nothing planned so it would come as an even bigger surprise when we finally did it			0
' the other best man gave his speech and then i stepped up			2
a normal speech just would n't have been me at all , but a year ago i would n't have had the confidence to sing like that either			0
he said : ' the reaction from everyone at the wedding was brilliant			0
it could n't have gone better ' ' but i joined a singing group last year where we did a production of @entity120 , and that kind of spurred me on to do more singing			2
' the reaction from everyone at the wedding was brilliant			0
it could n't have gone better			0
' i 've known @entity9 for about seven years after he started coming along to play for our @entity126 team			1
@entity9 , an accountant , and @entity10 , who works in @entity129 , married after meeting through work three years ago ' we were both single at the time so we would just go out drinking together			1
' mr @entity132 , an accountant , and his wife , who works in @entity129 , married after meeting through work three years ago			0
yesterday mr @entity132 , from @entity136 , @entity137 , said : ' i was interested to see what he would do , but i did n't think for a second it would be anything like that			0
' i thought it would be the usual best man - type stuff			0
' he did tell a couple of jokes and then pretended we were all going to have to go outside , but then he said he was kidding and let us all sit down again			0
' next thing i knew a guitar came out and he did that with @entity73			0
' i even stayed at @entity7 's the night before the wedding with @entity73 as well , and they did n't let on at all			1
' @entity10 loved it , she gets on well with both my best men so they were easy choices when it came to who to pick			2
' the wedding was full of friends more than extended family and a lot of younger people were there so the songs went down brilliantly			0
' i think he told the other best man the week before , who came round to my house really nervous , which makes perfect sense now , knowing he had got to do a speech with what was following			0
