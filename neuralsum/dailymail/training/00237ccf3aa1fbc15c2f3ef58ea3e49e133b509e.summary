@entity18 : parents who allow their children to play truant may be hit with heavy fines and even lose their benefits if they continue to allow their children to stay away from school ( file picture ) the plan is expected to be included in the @entity24 ’ election manifesto next year , having been blocked in coalition by the @entity27 , although a final decision has not yet been made			1
the proposal is expected to garner strong support , with surveys showing 64 per cent of voters in favour and only 25 per cent against			0
among conservative voters , 80 per cent say they back the idea			0
the @entity36 defines persistent absence as missing at least 15 per cent of school			1
some 41,224 penalty notices for non-attendance at school were issued in the academic year ending in summer 2012 – the latest for which figures are available – of which just 22,043 were paid within the time limit of 28 days			2
under the plan proposed by mr @entity12 , the penalty for the remaining 19,181 families would have been doubled to £ 120 and automatically docked from their child benefit			1
although £ 1.3million a year is raised from truancy fines , ministers say there is a problem with their enforcement			0

tough : education secretary @entity12 is trying to persuade @entity6 colleagues to allow the fines imposed on parents of persistent truants to be taken from their child benefit he added : ‘ during my review , when i met magistrates , schools and education welfare officers , they frequently expressed frustration with a system that takes up to six months to get a parent to court			1
one magistrate explained how parents could exploit the system by pleading not guilty , then failing to attend court when they were summoned and finally not paying any fine imposed by the magistrate			1
‘ parents who allow their child to miss too much school should receive a fine of £ 60			1
if they fail to pay in 28 days , the fine should double to £ 120 and the money should be recovered directly through child benefit			2
persistent failure to send children to school is a clear sign of neglect and that children ’s social care services should work with schools to address underlying difficulties			1
‘ the best schools work with parents to improve attendance			2
fining parents or taking them to court is a last resort			2
however , the system must be effective			0
’ the plan is thought to have broad support from most @entity6 cabinet ministers , although some involved in drawing up the manifesto are understood to have insisted that vulnerable families were not unduly affected			2
it is up to local authorities to set the criteria for issuing fines in their area			0
it is also ultimately up to the head teacher to decide whether to issue a fine			0
if a pupil has a medical condition that forces them to miss lessons , the school can use its discretion .			0
