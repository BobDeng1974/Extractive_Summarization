by @entity0 @entity2 's coming price hikes could hit steak lovers particularly hard			2

@entity17 will raise the cost of steak dishes as the company is forced to pay more for beef due to the dwindling numbers of cattle in the @entity24 ' there 's a very narrow gap between our steak burrito and our chicken burrito			1
we 're going to widen that , ' @entity12 said at the @entity32 and @entity31 in @entity33			0
' we 're going to allow our customers to choose whether they want to pay the higher price of steak			0
' @entity12 also said the price hike would be more like 4 percent to 6 percent , or 32 cents to 48 cents , assuming the cost of a burrito is $ 8			1
in the past , executives had said they were considering a hike of 3 percent to 5 percent , or 24 cents to 40 cents			0

@entity68 's head of @entity70 operations , @entity67 , has also noted that the chain has been able to maintain its profitability in part by marketing chicken items more aggressively			0
this week , @entity75 - based @entity68 is bringing back its popular ' @entity77 ' advertising campaign from a decade ago to promote a chicken version of its @entity80 sandwich			0
