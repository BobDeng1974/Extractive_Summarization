@entity0 has vowed to expose the identities of the four boys behind the rape of a 17 - year - old girl who killed herself after they circulated a photograph of the assault			1
the hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed culprits were and that they were confirming the identity of a third before putting them on the @entity14			2
in a post the group added that it was ‘ only a matter ’ of time before they got the fourth as well			2
tragic : @entity21 , 17 , has killed herself after allegedly being gang - raped and then bullied @entity0 said that it took action after police in @entity25 , @entity26 , charged nobody over the death of @entity21			1
there were also no charges for any of the boys for sending the pictures to their friends			1
phantom menace : the hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed rapists of @entity21 were once the picture was spread around @entity21 ’s school she was subjected to brutal bullying on and off the @entity14 , which was so bad she had to move school and move house			1
@entity0 has now called for a protest outside the headquarters of the @entity48 in @entity49 , near where @entity21 lived			1

@entity21 hanged herself in her family 's bathroom on thursday after months of torment and , on sunday night , her parents took her off life support			1
questions are now emerging over whether authorities did enough to help the girl who relatives said quickly slipped from an a-student to a moody , unpredictable teenager			1

the anonymous post is called ‘ @entity76 ’			2
it reads : ‘ @entity0 has confirmed the identities of two of the four alleged rapists			2
we are currently confirming a third and it is only a matter of time before the fourth is identified as well			2
‘ our demands are simple : we want the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity48 to take immediate legal action against the individuals in question			2
@entity88 action : @entity0 has now called for a protest outside the headquarters of the @entity48 in @entity49 as part of ' @entity76 ' on @entity88 ‘ we encourage you to act fast			2
if we were able to locate these boys within 2 hours , it will not be long before someone else finds them			1
‘ we do not approve of vigilante justice as the media claims			2
that would mean we approve of violent actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob			2
what we want is justice			0
and that 's your job			0
‘ the names of the rapists will be kept until it is apparent you have no intention of providing justice to @entity21 's family			1

they did n't even interview the boys until much , much later , ' to me , i ’d think you ’d get the boys right away , separate them			2
” relatives said they saw the photograph but could not determine who had taken it , so were unable to charge the teenagers - even though the picture legally constituted child pornography			0
' the whole case was full of things like that , ' @entity151 said			0
we did n’t have a rape kit done because we did n't even know until several days later when she had a breakdown in my kitchen			0
