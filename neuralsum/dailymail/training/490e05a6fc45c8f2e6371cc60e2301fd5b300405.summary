by @entity0 last updated at 7:19 pm on 1st december 2011 from a distance , they look like painstaking recreations of classic paintings like the @entity5 and @entity6			1
but a closer look reveals these amazingly intricate artworks are created from thousands and thousands of childlike sketches			2
incredibly , @entity12 's works , which can take almost a year to create , are completely improvised and drawn directly onto paper without being drafted first			1
@entity12 's works , including his version of @entity17 's @entity16 ( above ) , can take almost a year to create			1
they are completely improvised and drawn directly onto paper without being drafted first a close - up of the @entity6 drawing shows how they are made up of thousands of childlike sketches ( including risque images , such as a naked lady as part of @entity28 's face ) he uses a tapestry of thousands of cartoon characters - woven together to resemble the famous works they mimic			1
blending abstract cartoon animals and iconic characters such as @entity37 in his hand - drawn creations , the artist combines his training in the arts with a childhood love of comics and graffiti to create the clever pictures			2
however , his decision to incorporate fully naked body doodles , particularly in religious works ( see close - up of @entity28 , right ) , may not be to everyone 's taste			1
as well as recreating famous paintings , mr @entity12 has also drawn doodle montages depicting classic sculptures , and some more personal landscape pieces			1
and the 27 - year - old , originally from @entity56 , northern @entity55 , does not draft the pictures , which can take months to create			1
he said : ' i do n't draft my work , i just draw it in pen , directly onto paper			1
' i usually use a 0.38mm pen , and sometimes ink thinned with water to achieve a grey tone , but that 's all			2
' despite his direct approach , mr @entity12 , who lives in @entity68 , said that some of the pictures have taken him months to complete			1
he said : ' it varies according to the size of the work			0
@entity6 took the longest time			0
i drew it for approximately ten months			0
' but a series of drawings i completed this year took around two to three weeks for each piece			2
' the artist draws on an unusual set of influences to create the stunning drawings , inspired by his university art degree and his love of popular culture			0
he said : ' it was only when i was around 20 years old that i became interested in art. ' however , i have liked comics since i was a child - i 've probably been drawing comic book pictures since i was seven			2
@entity12 's recreations , such as his take on @entity17 's @entity5 , are inspired by his childhood love of comics and graffiti the artist 's comic - book style can be seen in this close - up of @entity5 , which includes a @entity101 - like phallus among the more innocent illustrations ' i loved to draw cartoons and graffiti from a young age , and i get inspiration from rock music or sometimes even novels			1
' as well as the obvious love of comic book - style art , mr @entity12 , a graduate of @entity109 , also has some more highbrow influences			1
he said : ' i am inspired by @entity114 , [ @entity55 artist ] @entity115 and @entity116			0
' i 'm also inspired by the @entity117 , which is a religious painting illustrating esoteric @entity120 and @entity120 sutras			0
it was a feature of my childhood			0
' the @entity117 , or circle , is a feature of @entity120 and @entity125 and is said to represent the ' unconscious self '			0
mr @entity12 has displayed his work in a number of chic art galleries around @entity68 , although he has yet to be given a solo exhibition for his incredible talents			1
' i have a contract with a contemporary art gallery here in @entity55			0
' approximately one - third of my pictures have sold now			0
' but success comes at a price for the young artist , as selling a picture means he has to let go of one of his painstakingly crafted works			2
he said : ' i am glad when a picture sells , but on the other hand , i feel a little sad when they do			0
' it 's difficult to choose a favourite			0
@entity6 took the most time , so i had a strong attachment to that			0
