by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:26 est , 2 february 2014 it might not be the kind of race that @entity7 and @entity8 fans are used to , but the battle for fourth spot and @entity12 football could come down to the two great rivals			1
@entity15 and @entity16 fans might disagree but , despite their ongoing struggles , sooner or later @entity7 will go on a run			1
seven points is a big gap , but it ’s not insurmountable			2
@entity8 still have to go to @entity22 and @entity7 can turn it around , particularly when @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 combine			1
there is absolutely no love lost between the clubs , so it will be a real test of nerve			2
whatever happens , it will be a game - changer for either side			2
roaring success : with @entity23 back in action , @entity7 can reach the @entity12 @entity36 : @entity8 can keep @entity37 ( left ) if they secure @entity12 football playmaker : @entity24 , battling @entity42 's @entity41 , could be the difference in @entity7 's fight for fourth @entity8 have been without @entity12 football for three seasons now , so to get back in would be huge			1
they could attract more players and increase the chances of hanging onto the likes of @entity37 for the long term			2
for @entity7 , dropping out of @entity53 ’s top competition is almost unthinkable			1
they have been in it since 1995 and the impact would be massive financially and for keeping their best players			0
missing out ? @entity15 , with @entity59 celebrating against @entity60 , want to cap off a fantastic season back in action : @entity63 helped @entity12 - chasing @entity16 to a point at @entity65 @entity67 map v @entity68 it ’s a hard job picking the best signing of the transfer window			1
we have not seen them all play and some will take time to settle , but you would be hard pressed to find a more exciting player than @entity77			1
he has barely featured for @entity7 , but we are not always privy to what happens on the training ground so ca n’t say why he ’s not been playing			1
but he is a talent that gets bums off seats			0
he had an instant impact on saturday , hugging the touchline , as his pitch map ( right ) shows , and setting up a goal			0
in 52 minutes he achieved more than in his two games for @entity7 and i ’m sure @entity92 will want to unleash him in the @entity95 derby on @entity96			1
wing wonder : @entity77 showed why he is the most exciting signing of the january transfer window only a few months ago i was talking to @entity100 and he had his knee in a brace			1
he wo n’t have felt further from the @entity103 , but against @entity104 he was back with a bang			1
@entity106 will see him as a real option now and the good news is there wo n’t be any worries about him playing too much football and being fatigued			0
he ’s a nice lad and he ’ll be chomping at the bit			0
and do n’t forget he knows what it ’s like to score in the @entity115 ... beaming : @entity100 was back with a bang against @entity104 , celebrating his second goal @entity118 lost form before @entity120 but at @entity121 , they were back to their best			1
in @entity123 and @entity124 they have two of @entity127 ’s best young players and they were exceptional			0
@entity123 scored from a tight angle while @entity124 went one better with a superb curling effort			0
do n’t be surprised if both end up on the plane to @entity132 in the summer			0
@entity118 have won 3/3 @entity134 games when @entity123 and @entity124 have both scored @entity136 never really achieved hero status at @entity8 but , with two goals and a win against @entity7 on saturday , i ’m sure he will have had the fans on @entity141 smiling			1
there was more than a touch of fortune about his first goal , which took a huge deflection to beat @entity148 , but there was nothing lucky about his second — it was an absolute screamer right into the top corner			0
@entity136 has always had that kind of power in his locker and he unleashed it to devastating effect			0
i have always been a fan of @entity136 and his sweet left foot is capable of winning matches			0
what a way to prove it			0
@entity161 powerhouse : @entity136 ( left ) celebrates with @entity162 after his stunning goal downed @entity7 @entity164 was back among the goals on saturday and that is no surprise			1
why ? @entity168 is back			1
i played against @entity164 and he was one of the best players at making late runs to become the third man in attack			2
he was like a magnet to knock - downs			0
that ’s exactly what he did against @entity178 , benefiting from two of @entity168 ’s headers to score			2
he had the same relationship with @entity183 at @entity184 and though the style might not always be appreciated by the @entity187 faithful , they will certainly appreciate those goals			2
@entity189 : @entity164 was back in the goals on saturday thanks to @entity168 's hold up play aerial threat : @entity164 benefited from two @entity168 headers to give @entity187 a priceless victory against @entity178 i watched @entity197 ’s 3 - 3 draw with @entity198 on saturday lunchtime and it was one of the games of the weekend			1
there were some excellent performances with plenty of players who would be at home in the @entity134			0
@entity198 ’s young right back @entity208 is one of the best passers i ’ve seen in his position while @entity212 underlined his quality with yet another goal			2
@entity215 made a good debut for @entity197 and @entity217 , the league ’s best midfielder , was excellent			0
just three points separate the sides , so this promotion race could go to the wire			0
super hoops : @entity224 and @entity215 celebrate levelling the scores at 3 - 3 for @entity197 against @entity198			0

@entity7 and @entity8 will fight it out for the fourth spot
@entity77 is the most exciting signing of the january window
@entity164 is in the goals again thanks to the return of @entity168
@entity100 was back with a bang against @entity104
