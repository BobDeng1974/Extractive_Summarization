a @entity1 photograph of a baby holding a rifle taken at a @entity5 gun store 20 miles from the scene of the @entity8 massacre has sparked outrage			1
the photo of the six month old baby @entity11 , with the firearm was posted onto @entity1 by her father , @entity13 before he purchased the gun from @entity15 on tuesday			1
despite the bolt action rifle being made safe , the photo which was shared online with the @entity18 gun store caused a furious reaction in the community still raw from the deaths of 20 children and six teachers in december of 2012			1
scroll down for @entity25 offending picture : this is the image that @entity13 uploaded to @entity1 of his six - month - old daughter @entity28 at @entity29 where he photographed her holding a rifle indeed , so great was the backlash in @entity5 that @entity15 , which previously said it was proud to post the picture online , deleted the image from its @entity1 account			1
' after everything that happened in @entity5 with @entity8 and everything that ’s going on with the gun laws , why would you have your baby holding a gun – a big gun ? ' said local resident @entity43 to @entity44			1
however , the child 's unrepentant father said that he had no regrets and would do it again			1
' other people being upset about it ? i do n’t force their kids to do anything			0
i do n’t force them to do anything , ' said @entity13			2
' my hand was on it , the bolt was open , it was safety checked			0
i ’m not sure how wide the picture is			0
she ’s clearly in her seat just sitting up , one hand on the scope , one hand on the barrel			0
' no problem : @entity13 with his baby girl @entity28 told news crews in @entity5 that the gun was totally safe and his baby was in danger at all @entity75 's girl : @entity28 was in no danger her father @entity13 said when quizzed on why he let her hold a rifle at @entity79 in @entity5 @entity13 claimed that the picture came about by accident when he was at the store searching for a new rifle			1
' the little one actually latched onto it when i first picked it up to see how heavy it was			0
it ’s actually very light , to test the weight , so i just decided to take the picture , ' said @entity13 to @entity44			2
some members of the public were simply baffled			0
' she ca n’t even speak yet and she has a gun in her hand and it ’s bizarre , ' said @entity97 , @entity98			0
in a state which is enacting stringent controls on assault rifles in the aftermath of the @entity8 massacre , some felt that the criticism went too far			2
' it ’s nothing , i do n’t know why that would bother people to be honest with you , ' said @entity111 , who was browsing in @entity15			0
controversial : this is the frontage of @entity15 in @entity5 - just 20 miles from the scene of the @entity8 which occurred in december 2012 the store ’s owner initially said he had no problem with it before he bowed to public pressure			1
' if someone wants to share something with the rest of the community , i have no problem posting it on the page , ' said @entity125 , co-owner			0
indeed , @entity125 was probably mindful of the experience of @entity128 shop in @entity129 , @entity5			2
it was the store which sold the semi-automatic weapon that @entity8 shooter , @entity133 , used to kill 26 people at the elementary school			1
in april , it was announced that the store had lost its license to sell guns and now is able to only deal in survival equipment and provisions .			0
