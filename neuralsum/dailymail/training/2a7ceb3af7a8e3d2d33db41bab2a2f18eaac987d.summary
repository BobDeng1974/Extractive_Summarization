only one in five @entity1 men would say they are at the happiest and healthiest point in their lives , according to new research			1
the study done by the @entity6 also found men were at their mental best between the ages of 30 and 34 , and their worst between the ages of 45 and 49			1
the release of this new research coincides with @entity12 , which started on sunday and ends on saturday			0
two - time world surfing champion @entity13 suffered from low - level depression @entity16 director @entity15 said the results indicated more needed to be done to change the attitudes of men towards mental health			1
the study surveyed more than 1,500 @entity1 men from the age of 18 and up			1
a person who has experienced the struggles of admitting that he suffered depression is two - time world surfing champion @entity13 who denied he had the mental illness for a number of years before he sought help			2
the @entity1 - who won the @entity31 in 1983 and 1984 - said his ' low level ' depression was only realised after he became addicted to amphetamines			2
' drugs lifted me up			0
it really helped me get up and engage with the world and that 's what i treated myself with for many years until it stopped working , ' @entity13 told @entity42			0
' i only truly recognised it [ my depression ] probably around the age of 45 years old			2
' the @entity6 research found only one in five @entity1 men felt like they were at their happiest point in life @entity49 ( pictured here in 2004 ) urged people to seek help as early as possible for their mental health issues @entity13 urged men to talk about their mental health concerns			1
he said they usually found it hard to talk about mental issues because talking about feelings went against the tradtional male stereotype ' i think men have get this strong message when they 're young that they have to be in control and be fearless , ' he said			2
' how we talk is quite foreign â€“ the idea of talking about how we 're feeling , it does n't make quite much sense to us yet			0
' @entity13 encouraged those who were feeling ' disconnected ' from the world to talk about it and address mental health issues sooner rather than later			1
' those things you do n't want to talk about , it will grow , that 's what my experience has taught me , ' he said			0
' they do n't go away , they just fester and grow and when you bring the light onto it , it starts to diminish			0
' it might be slow or it might quick , but it will diminish [ if you talk about it ]			0
' most importantly , @entity13 said the best way to recover from mental illness was not to go through it alone			0
the release of the research coincides with @entity12 and comes before the launch of @entity6 on november 1 ' @entity95 can trap us within ourselves and disconnect us from outside world and separates us completely ... in some cases , it can be very hard to dig out of , ' he said			2
' start dialogue with someone you feel comfortable with , the people you often care about are the ones to start that off with			0
' it 's important to talk about how you are going with someone and work through it			0
sometimes it is a slow process but depression can really change your body chemistry			0
' despite men 's mental health becoming a more talked about issue , @entity16 director @entity15 said the results of the study highlighted there was still a long way to go			1
men were more likely to turn to @entity120 than talk to their peers to find out more about mental health issues , and would rather talk to their doctors over their partners to about their problems			1
meanwhile , 56 per cent of men surveyed said they would prefer to talk politics with their friends compared to the 28 per cent who would talk about their mental health concerns			1
' five times as many guys do nothing at all about a mental health concern versus a physical one , ' mr @entity131 said			1
' we want every man across the country to take their health more seriously - mental as well as physical			2
' the research found one in four men would wait several months before to seek advice when it came to mental health , whereas 86 per cent who would take steps to put right a physical issue in just a matter of weeks			1
mr @entity131 also urged the public to take part in @entity6 to help raise awareness and funds for prostate and testicular cancers , and mental health problems as 75 per cent of men did not know the symptoms of the cancers and 50 per cent were not familiar with the signs of depression			1
@entity6 kicks off across the nation on november 1			0
