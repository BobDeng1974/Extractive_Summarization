nestled in the buzzing streets of west @entity2 , @entity0 has long been considered a playground for the rich and famous			2
and every summer @entity5 playboys speed around its polished streets in garish super cars worth hundreds of thousands of pounds			2
but one @entity10 woman has given the young men a run for their money - by parking her crystal - encrusted mercedes outside an exclusive hotel for the world to see			2
miss @entity35 , a business studies student in @entity2 , said she when she is ready to sell the car she will give the money to charity at £ 55,000 many would consider the @entity41 350 an extravagance in itself			1
but @entity42 made her 2014 model even more luxurious , by covering it entirely in @entity19 crystals			1
' i wanted to have something unique and do something special , ' the 21 - year - old business student said			1
' the people who did it came over from @entity10 and worked for 12 hours a day for two months on the car			2

' it has only just been finished and everywhere i go people stop to have a look at it			0
' it gets lots of attention from people walking by and in cars			0
sometimes i think they might crash			0
' everyone is taking pictures of it			0
when i sell the car i will give the money to charity			0
' onlookers stopped to admire the vehicle which usually costs around £ 55,000			1
it is not known how much miss @entity42 spent on her bespoke treatment a man gently places his hand on the car to feel some of the thousands of @entity19 crystals that have been stuck on to its exterior by a bespoke team @entity83 : no detail has been spared in the custom - job which is thought to have cost experts two months to complete			1
the car attracted attention in @entity2 this afternoon the @entity89 is usually the trademark of company executives and luxury taxi services but has been given a blingtastic makeover by @entity94 sparkling : even the car 's door handles have been included in the transformation which @entity10 - born miss @entity42 shared on her @entity99 page just in case : a small plastic bag of spare crystals rests on the passenger seat in case any of the one million crystals on its exterior falls off the dazzling car attracted more attention than any other that staff at @entity112 had seen before including some of the more garish models driven by men as night fell the vehicle twinkled and sparkled as miss @entity42 drove home			1
the luxury jacket trader gave it the aptly named registration plate ' baiibyy ' miss @entity42 poses with a friend on the bonnet of her custom @entity41 350			1
the 21 - year - old is studying business in @entity2 but is originally from @entity10 the @entity125 is covered in one million individual @entity19 crystals			1

they worked for 12 hours a day for two months straight to attach the diamonds , worth £ 20,000 , to the car			1
every single part of the vehicle has been covered in the crystals , from the bumper to the rear , right down to the door handles and wing mirrors			2
the 2011 @entity20 model , which is a diesel and is owned by 21 - year - old @entity10 @entity42 , is now said to be worth much more than its average £ 55,000 asking price			1
@entity42 , who shares her privileged adventures on @entity99 , uploaded a photograph of the finished product to the photo and video sharing website accompanied with the hashtags : ' # crystal ' crystalcar # knightsbridge # harrods and im not an # arab guy ( sic ) '			2
