the @entity1 's director warned technology firms not to encrypt smartphone data and operating systems because it risks stalling murder investigations and allowing suspects to walk free			0
@entity7 said justice could be thwarted by a locked phone or an encrypted hard drive , likening encrypted data to a safe that can not be cracked or a closet door that wo n't open			1
he said the move by tech companies to protect user communications in the name of privacy is certain to impede a wide range of criminal investigations			1
new legislation to allow law enforcement to intercept communications is needed at a time of advancing technology and new forms of communication , he added			1
warning : @entity1 director @entity7 said justice could be thwarted by a locked phone or an encrypted hard drive , likening encrypted data to a safe that can not be cracked or a closet door that wo n't open but privacy advocates and technology experts hit back at his plea , saying the concerns are exaggerated and little more than recycled arguments the government has raised against encryption since the early 1990s			1
' we have the legal authority to intercept and access communications from information pursuant to court order , but we often lack the technical ability to do so , ' @entity7 said in a @entity47 speech			1
@entity7 cited particular cases in which he said access to cell phone data aided in a criminal investigation			1
but in a question - and - answer session after the speech , he said he could not cite particular instances in which someone was rescued from danger who would n't have been had law enforcement been blocked from that information			1
' rescuing someone before they 're harmed ? someone in the trunk of a car or something ? ' @entity7 asked			2
' i do n't think i know yet			0
' unstuck : @entity7 also said the @entity1 was committed to a ' front - door ' approach , through court orders and under strict oversight , to intercepting communications but , he added , ' logic tells me there are going to be cases just like that			2
' the speech , which echoes concerns he and others in law enforcement have previously made , comes soon after announcements by @entity80 and @entity81 that their new operating systems will be encrypted , or protected with coding by default			1
law enforcement officials could still intercept conversations but might not be able to access call data , contacts , photos and email stored on the phone			1
while the companies ' actions are understandable , @entity7 said , ' the place they are leading us is one we should n't go to without careful thought and debate			2
' ' encryption is n't just a technical feature			0
it 's a marketing pitch			0
but it will have very serious consequences for law enforcement and national security agencies at every level , ' @entity7 said			1
the government 's concerns may also center in part on the use of @entity80 's @entity112 platform , which offers end - to - end encrypted text messages that supersede traditional sms messages			2
that kind of encryption likely provides access to those messages on users ' iphones , of which @entity80 has sold more than 240 million since 2013			0
default code : the speech , which echoes concerns he and others in law enforcement have previously made , comes soon after announcements by @entity80 and @entity81 that their new operating systems will be encrypted , or protected with coding by default he acknowledged a rise in public mistrust of government in the year since former @entity136 systems analyst revealed @entity136 secret intelligence collection programs			1
but he said the public was wrong to believe that law enforcement can access any and all communications with the flip of a switch			1
' it may be true in the movies or on tv			0
it is simply not the case in real life , ' he said			0
@entity7 also said the @entity1 was committed to a ' front - door ' approach , through court orders and under strict oversight , to intercepting communications			2
privacy advocates have long been concerned that that development would create an opening for hackers to exploit			0
the @entity157 noted that federal law protects the right of companies to add encryption with no backdoors and said the companies should be credited for being ' unwilling to weaken security for everyone			0
' ' whether you call it a ' front door ' or a ' back door , ' weakening the security of a system to enable law enforcement access also opens that door to foreign governments and criminals , ' said @entity176 , principal technologist with the @entity157 's @entity177			2
@entity178 , a cryptology professor at @entity179 , said the debate over personal encryption is n't new : back in the 1990s , when personal computers were a novelty , he said most consumers were n't even aware of encryption			0
when a form of email encryption called @entity188 was released , he said , there was a fear that criminals would use it			0
' these technologies exist ' for consumers to protect their privacy , he said , ' and it 's very hard to do anything about it			0
' the @entity197 said in a statement that law enforcement already has ways to obtain the electronic data it needs			2
' encryption of our personal devices and communications enhances the security of our most private information , ' the center said .			0

@entity7 likened encrypted phone to a safe that can not be *unlocked*
comes after @entity80 and @entity81 say new *models* will be encrypted by default
he says the move is certain to impede wide range of criminal investigations
he calls for new laws to let law enforcement to intercept communications
