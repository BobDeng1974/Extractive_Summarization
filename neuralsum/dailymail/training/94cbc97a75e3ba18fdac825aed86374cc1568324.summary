fifteen years ago , when he was plucked from obscurity to play the role of ballet - dancing @entity3 in the hit film , @entity0 felt like the luckiest boy in the world			1
he was so grateful to the man who discovered him - the film 's flamboyant director @entity10 - that he promptly left his down - to - earth family in @entity13 and moved in with @entity14 and his then partner , stage designer @entity15			2
it was an intense relationship , with @entity14 assuming the role of surrogate dad to a teenager whose biological father had never played any role in his life			0
he moved from a post-war semi to a 15th century manor in the @entity38 , and from a working - class area to a metrosexual acting crowd that moved between @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			0
just how quickly he left his family behind was obvious when he won a @entity46 for his performance as @entity3 , and kissed @entity14 in celebration rather than his mother , @entity49			0
this was to be just the start of a bohemian , transatlantic life , which saw @entity0 attempt , albeit with limited success , to crack @entity55			1
encouraged by his mentor @entity14 , he embraced the progressive values of his new showbusiness world			2
the actor still describes himself as a ' lucky husband ' on @entity61 his @entity61 feed is liberally sprinkled with gay rights postings , while he was proud to set up home with the openly bisexual actress , @entity25 , 26 , who two years ago became his wife and last summer bore him a son			1
all in all , @entity0 , 28 , seemed to lead an enviably charmed life			1
yet last month the couple gave a statement announcing the end of their marriage , speaking vaguely of their ' mutual decision ' to part , their ' love and respect ' and a commitment to ' co-parenting ' their son			2
whatever the couple 's claims , in truth the split was far from amicable			2
more telling were @entity0 's posts on @entity61 , where he still poignantly describes himself as ' a lucky husband , a devoted father , an actor , tap dancer , @entity94 supporter and major procrastinator '			1
just three weeks ago he posted ' @entity96 [ @entity97 ] @ @entity98			2
just in case i do n't tell you enough ' , before adding forlornly three days later : ' and then there was nothing			0
' days later , he posted one more comment ( which has subsequently been deleted ) : ' do n't punish people for things they ca n't control			0
' @entity109 though it sounds , the meaning was immediately clear to his friends and family			0
for many believe it is his wife 's enduring attraction to women that lies at the heart of their split			1
the night before she announced the breakdown of her marriage , the blonde actress appeared at a gala in @entity44 titled ' @entity126 ' - a fundraiser for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community			2
there she posed for a photograph with @entity133 , an actress she has openly confessed to having a crush on , and @entity136 , another bisexual actress who has reportedly set her cap at @entity25 after allegedly splitting from @entity139 supermodel @entity138			1
days later @entity25 was posing for a photograph with another prominent lesbian couple , the model @entity143 and fashion designer @entity144 ( granddaughter of the author @entity146 )			1
like @entity0 's cryptic comment , this image was also swiftly deleted from social networking sites after the split was announced			1
but while @entity25 may be enjoying a whirl of parties , @entity0 - whose acting career is still to fulfill its early promise - is said to be reeling from the split			1
' it 's a miracle he has n’t had a complete nervous breakdown , but he 's a canny lad and a strong person , ' a childhood friend said this week			0
' all the good things in his life happened because of @entity3 , but so did all the rubbish that drags him down			0
he was confused for a long time , then he found @entity25 and sorted it all out			1
now he 's back where he started			0
overnight success : @entity0 found fame as a boy playing @entity3 ' i love him to bits , but i would n't swap places with him for all the tea in @entity172			1
' nor does @entity0 have a close and supportive family to turn to			1
his father @entity174 , 58 , a toolmaker , played no part in his life , leaving to start a new life and family on the @entity180			0
@entity0 's mother , @entity49 , was left to raise him and his older sister , @entity182 , 33 , as a single mother on her receptionist ’s wage			1
it was into this situation that @entity10 landed , quickly becoming the father figure @entity0 had so sorely missed			1
the director taught @entity0 to shoot and drive , presenting him with a shotgun and one of the @entity193 jeeps used in the film @entity194			1
schooling was gradually set aside as his career took off , with a series of well - received yet unremarkable movies , such as @entity199			0
his early girlfriends , who included a shop assistant and a nurse , could not compete with the glitz of his film - star life			0
@entity0 rapidly developed a reputation for being spiky and awkward			1
he gave interviews in a t - shirt emblazoned with the words : ' f * * * you			0
' by the age of 18 he was fully immersed in the louche world of showbusiness and about to film his first major adult role , in @entity215 ’s blockbuster adaptation of @entity216 , when he met @entity25 , from @entity217			1
' she fitted the bill perfectly , ' says his friend			0
' she was totally different from the girls at home			0
really alternative , cool and with that incredible confidence @entity224 girls have			0
@entity0 was just dazzled by her			1
' the couple shortly after they met filming @entity216 : they went on to have a son together yet for all his adopted quirkiness , @entity0 remained fundamentally conservative compared to @entity25 , who soon ended their relationship , before taking up with another man , rock star @entity235 , almost 25 years her senior			1
it was to mark a low point for @entity0 , who was also stung by the relative failure of @entity216			1
he moved into a flat with a ' special friend ' - a man he never identified , but had known since before @entity3 - and they were inseparable for a while , though there is no suggestion of a romantic involvement			0
his rare visits back home to @entity247 were increasingly awkward			0
on one occasion a stranger spat on him , whereupon @entity0 's companion chased him down the road to dish out summary justice			1
he became increasingly withdrawn and between the ages of 22 and 25 effectively took a career break as the major roles he craved failed to materialise			0
@entity256 came in the form of @entity258 , who cast him as the lead in his adaptation of the comic book @entity262			0
@entity25 when she was pregnant : the couple will now share custody of their son but though the film turned a healthy profit , it barely registered in the @entity224 heartland regarded by @entity55 as the true mark of stardom			1
by then he had bought an apartment in @entity43			0
his broad @entity277 accent was replaced with a @entity279 twang			0
through it all , however , he craved stability - something he appeared to achieve when he reconciled with @entity25 in 2011			2
he moved from @entity43 to @entity44 to be near to her , eschewing the starry @entity283 for the more edgy beachside neighbourhoods to the west of the city			0
the couple were regularly seen out on their bicycles , shopping in organic supermarkets and eating in fashionable coffee shops and restaurants			0
@entity0 also joined his girlfriend as a vocal campaigner for gay rights , seemingly comfortable with her bisexuality			1
recent events have cast that in a different light			0
and @entity0 's devastation at the end of their marriage is exacerbated by the prospect of being separated from his son			1
he has spoken touchingly about how the ten - month - old - whose name has been kept secret by @entity0 and @entity25 - has enriched his life			1
when you become a parent everything changes , ' he said recently			2
' for such a long time , i thought of myself as a teenager gallivanting around the world taking jobs where i felt like it , but life is totally different now			2
' he changes nappies , feeds and nurtures his son in a way his own father never did			2
friends say that he is determined to play an active role in the boy 's life , and that the couple plan to share custody			2
somewhat ironically , just as his personal life has taken such a turn for the worse , his faltering career seems to be on the upswing			0
@entity0 is filming a hotly anticipated remake of the @entity333 superhero franchise , which may yet launch him onto the @entity55 a-list			2
as @entity10 said in the aftermath of his big breakthrough : ' @entity0 is just amazing			2
i hope we do n't screw him up , turn him into @entity339 or something			0
' given the latest turn of events in poor @entity0 's life , it ’s as well that his talent is matched by a remarkable emotional resilience .			2
