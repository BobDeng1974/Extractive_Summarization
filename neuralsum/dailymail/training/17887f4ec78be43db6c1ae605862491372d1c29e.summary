@entity0 is likely to have to accept a considerable cut in payments when his new clothing deal is unveiled as his lucrative five - year deal with adidas comes to an end			1
@entity0 is shortly expected to announce a new major sponsor , joining @entity8 and @entity9 on the clothing - go - round as @entity12 players ’ on - court appearance change considerably in 2015			1
@entity15 has also left adidas and gone to their fellow giants @entity17 , while @entity0 is expected to replace his expiring five year $ 15 million deal with an arrangement promoting a company less automatically associated with tennis			1
@entity0 wears an adidas t - shirt during a training session ahead of the @entity24 earlier this year it is believed that a frontrunner in negotiations has been @entity29 company @entity28 , who are more known in this country for their deal kitting out @entity34			1
at present their tennis involvement has been limited , although they currently kit out rising @entity29 star @entity38 and the veteran @entity29 journeyman @entity39			2
it could be that they see @entity0 as a good fit for their slightly edgier , sport - specific image			1
industry experts say that @entity46 have also been interested in expanding their tennis presence , although last year they signed @entity49 ’s @entity48			0
rumours that @entity0 might revert to his old clothing partner , @entity52 , are reckoned to be inaccurate			0
regardless , the money is not likely to approach the $ 3 million per year that adidas have been paying the 27 year - old @entity55 over a period that took in his @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 triumphs			1
@entity0 shows his frustrations on court as he suffers defeat to @entity64 at the @entity65 last month the reduced upfront payment , perhaps barely half the previous sum according to industry observers , is partly due to him failing to reproduce that form in the year that saw him return from back surgery			2
it is also recognition that he is heading into his late twenties and that adidas replica kit sales have not been as high as hoped in what is said to be a relatively depressed market overall at present			0
the new deal will have to take into account that he is likely to continue wearing adidas tennis shoes , as this has been his favoured footwear since he was a teenager			0
@entity0 ’s representatives did not wish to comment , although they confirmed that an announcement is expected in the next few weeks			0
his departure from adidas will top a year of change that saw @entity89 , assistant coach @entity90 and fitness trainer @entity91 depart his team and @entity93 installed at its head			0
@entity0 used to wear the clothing of @entity52 but is unlikely to return to his old sponsor whenever she reappears @entity15 will be wearing the swoosh instead of the three stripes			2
she is currently training in @entity100 and her return from long - term wrist problems is increasingly likely to be in the @entity29 rather than at the @entity24			2
emerging @entity12 no 2 @entity9 , who has risen to the cusp of the top 100 , is expected to appear next year kitted out on court by @entity106			0
until now the well - known @entity12 brand , whose founder @entity108 is a long - established tennis nut , has restricted itself to providing suits for players and @entity12 teams when out and about at official functions but they are now looking for deeper involvement			0
@entity8 has left adidas to join their major clothing rivals @entity17 ahead of her return to the court @entity12 no 2 @entity9 is expected to appear on court next year in tennis kit by @entity106			1

@entity0 *'s* five - year deal with adidas has come to an end
@entity29 company @entity28 are frontrunners to be his new sponsor
@entity8 left adidas earlier this year to sign up with rivals @entity17
