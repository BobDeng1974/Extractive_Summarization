the intricate patterns of 2,500 - year - old tattoos - some from the body of a @entity4 ' princess ' preserved in the permafrost - have been revealed in @entity6			1
the remarkable body art includes mythological creatures and experts say the elaborate drawings were a sign of age and status for the ancient nomadic @entity15 people , described in the 5th century @entity16 by the @entity18 historian @entity17			2
but scientist @entity21 - who discovered the remains of ice - clad ' princess @entity19 ' high in the @entity20 - is also struck about how little has changed in more than two millennia			0
@entity25 of princess @entity19 , who died aged 25 , had several tattoos on her body , including a deer with a griffon 's beak and a @entity33 's antlers			1
the tattoos have been perfectly preserved for 2,500 years			1
' i think we have not moved far from @entity38 in how the tattoos are made , ' she told the @entity40 ( @entity41 )			0
princess @entity19 , who died aged 25 , was believed to be either a royal , a revered folk tale narrator , a healer or a holy woman			0
she was surrounded by two male warriors to protect her , and six horses to ease their journey into the next life			1
' it is still about a craving to make yourself as beautiful as possible			0
' ' for example , about the @entity54			0
' a lot of them go on holiday to @entity18 , and when i 've been there i heard how @entity18 were smiling and saying that a @entity54 man 's age can be easily understood by the number of tattoos on his body			1
' i 'm talking the working class now			0
' and i noticed it , too			0
' the older a person , the more tattoos are on his body			1
' dr @entity21 added : ' we can say that most likely there was - and is - one place on the body for everyone to start putting the tattoos on , and it was a left shoulder			1
' i can assume so because all the mummies we found with just one tattoo had it on their left shoulders			1
researchers also found two warriors close to the princess , and were able to reconstruct their tattoos			1
here , one is shown with an animal covering the right side of his body , across his right shoulder and stretching from his chest to his back			2
' and nowadays this is the same place where people try to put the tattoos on , thousands of years on			0
' i think its linked to the body composition - as the left shoulder is the place where it is noticeable most , where it looks the most beautiful			1
' nothing changes with years , the body stays the same , and the person making a tattoo now is getting closer to his ancestors than he or she may realise			0
' the tattoo patterns are from the ancient ' princess ' who died at around the age of 25 - and from two warriors found on an ancient permafrost burial site at @entity111 some 2,500 metres above sea level close to @entity6 's frontiers with modern day @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
princess @entity19 's hand with marked tattoos on her fingers			2
she was dug out of the ice 19 years ago , and is set to go on public display in the @entity122			2
the reconstruction of the tattoos in the images shown here were released to coincide with the moving of the remains of the princess , dug out of the ice 19 year ago , to a permanent glass sarcophagus in the @entity132 in @entity133 , capital of the @entity122			1
eventually she will be displayed to tourists			0
buried around her were six horses , saddled and bridled , her spiritual escorts to the next world , and a symbol of her evident status , though experts are divided on whether she was a royal or a revered folk tale narrator , a healer or a holy woman			2
next to hear body was a meal of sheep and horse meat and ornaments made from felt , wood , bronze and gold			0
and a small container of cannabis , say some accounts , along with a stone plate on which were the burned seeds of coriander			0
' tattoos were used as a mean of personal identification - like a passport now , if you like , ' said dr @entity21			0
the tattoos of one of two warriors found on the ancient permafrost burial site at @entity111 some 2,500 metres above sea level close to @entity6 's frontiers with modern day @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 tattoos are clearly visible on one of the warrior 's shoulders			1
the designs are similar to those found on the princess			0
' the @entity178 also believed the tattoos would be helpful in another life , making it easy for the people of the same family and culture to find each other after death			2
' @entity178 repeated the same images of animals in other types of art , which is considered to be like a language of animal images , which represented their thoughts			0
' the tattoos were ' used to express some thoughts and to define one 's position both in society , and in the world			2
the more tattoos were on the body , the longer it meant the person lived , and the higher was his position			2
' for example the body of one man , which was found earlier in the 20th century , had his entire body covered with tattoos , as you see on the picture of his torso , ' said dr @entity21			1
' our young woman - the princess - has only her two arms tattooed			0
so they signified both age and status			0
' the @entity221 plateau , @entity122 , @entity222 , where @entity19 and two warriors were discovered			1
their bodies were surrounded by six horses fully bridles , various offering of food and a pouch of cannabis			0
princess @entity19 : sculptor 's impression of what she looked like 2,500 years ago the @entity40 said : " the tattoos on the left shoulder of the ' princess ' show a mythological animal - a deer with a griffon 's beak and a @entity33 's antlers			1
' the antlers are decorated with the heads of griffons			0
' and the same griffon 's head is shown on the back of the animal			1
the mouth of a spotted panther with a long tail is seen at the legs of a sheep			0
' she also has a dear 's head on her wrist , with big antlers			2
' there is a drawing on the animal 's body on a thumb on her left hand			1
' on the man found close to the ' princess ' , the tattoos include the same fantastical creature , this time covering the right side of his body , across his right shoulder and stretching from his chest to his back			1
' the patterns mirror the tattoos on a much more elaborately covered male body dug from the ice in 1929 whose highly decorated torso in reconstructed in our drawing here			2
' his chest , arms , part of the back and the lower leg are covered with tattoos			0
there is an argali - a mountain sheep - along with the same dear with griffon 's vulture - like beak , with horns and the back of its head which has griffon 's head and an onager drawn on it			1

*incredibly* well preserved body found high in the @entity122 mountains , with two warriors buried close by for protections and six horses to ease the journey into the next life
