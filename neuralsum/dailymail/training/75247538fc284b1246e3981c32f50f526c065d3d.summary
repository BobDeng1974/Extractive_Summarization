mrs @entity23 said : ‘ we ’ve been trying to do things while the girls can still see them			2

‘ but really they are just two normal , seven - year - old girls who love horse riding and swimming , which is great for their posture and will benefit them greatly			2
‘ they ’re mad about playing with dolls and love school , and the other pupils have really taken to them and treat them just like everyone else			0
’ she added : ‘ they are doing so well and they are so strong willed			0
i ’m proud of their determination and their wish to be independent			0
‘ they also have a fantastic bond , like all twins really , but i think they have a bit of a sixth sense about when the other really needs them			0
‘ ultimately they really lean on each other and spur each other on , and i ’m glad they have each other for that support			0
’ mrs @entity23 , a primary school teacher , told how experts had struggled to identify what the girls were suffering from			0

‘ we were utterly devastated			0
we read it is incurable and children with it do n’t have a long life			0
it is a very complex condition which affects every organ in the body			1
‘ we looked at the list of symptoms the girls had and they ticked most of the criteria between them			0
‘ we did n’t really need the genetic test as we knew in our hearts that they had it			0
‘ we got the call back for @entity8 ’s positive result for @entity11 three days before @entity220 that year			1
‘ we were hoping and praying it was n’t going to be a positive result for @entity9 , but just three weeks later , our worst fears hit us hard			2

she says her world fell apart when they were diagnosed mrs @entity23 said : ' we were utterly devastated			0
we read it is incurable and children with it do n't have a long life			0
it is a very complex condition which affects every organ in the body ' ‘ every parent ’s worst nightmare is for their children to be poorly and @entity11 is totally out of our control , with no cure at present			1
’ the family say they have received life changing support from @entity245 ( @entity246 ) which will receive a grant this year from @entity248 @entity4 to fund an information dvd entitled living with @entity48			2
' this dvd is so important as it will be sent out to doctors to raise awareness of @entity11 , ' said mrs @entity23 who is also a trustee of the charity asuk which is attempting to raise £ 1m for research into the condition			1
' it is so rare that doctors just do n’t know about @entity186			0
we hope the @entity250 will lead to better understanding of the condition and quicker diagnosis			0
' the charity also organises fun days and events so that the girls get to meet children with the same condition which is very helpful			2
' they know what they ’ve got but they do n't realise the true extent of it			0
they know they are special			0
