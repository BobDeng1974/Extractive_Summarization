@entity8 , 20 , is seen holding a spleen in one image and also uploaded a snap of a seriously injured hand before making fun of the teenage patient while working at a hospital in @entity16 , 500miles east of @entity17			1
@entity8 was observing the surgery of a 16 - year - old girl who had fallen from an apartment building when she took the pictures , later calling the patient a ‘ 275lbs schizo ’			1
inexcusable : student nurse @entity23 instagrammed pictures from a surgery during her work experience and mocked the patient in the comments the student nurse uploaded the images to her @entity32 and engaged in conversation with her friends in the comment section , revealing personal details about the patient			1
the surgery at @entity39 involved a 16 - year - old female who fell from an eighth floor window in the @entity1 city			1
as the images of the patient 's organs were posted on the web , a friend asked @entity23 : ‘ are you having fun there ? ’ the third year trainee nurse , who wore full surgical dress for the picture replied : ‘ we sure are			1
' look , we do not sleep at night			2
by the way , the girl is 16			1
jumped from the eighth floor			2
’ bad doc : the 20 - year - old posed holding the spleen of a 16 - year - old female and took pictures during the young woman 's life - saving surgery at the hospital in @entity16 , @entity66 breach of trust : although the 16 - year - old patient may have been injured in an attempted suicide , @entity68 branded her a'275lbs schizo ' along with the pictures from the teenager 's surgery the friend said : ‘ nasty			1
how is she ? ’ @entity8 , a student of @entity75 , said : ‘ in a hard condition - broken ribs , legs , head injuries , spleen is torn , easier to say what is ok			1
‘ she 's a “ @entity81 ” , weighs over 275lbs ’ the friend replied : ‘ well now i see why she did it			2
’ the images has now been brought to light , and @entity23 has been banned from returning to work at the hospital and may be excluded from her degree			1
‘ i totally disapprove of this			2
it is a horrible case , ’ @entity39 director @entity90 said			0
‘ it was a serious surgery , the young woman fell from the eight floor			2
the team of doctors saved her life and this girl left the operation scene to take photos			0
‘ of course she will never come back here for medical practice			0
‘ it is a matter of choosing people as medics of the future			0
the medical college must understand this			0
’ rapped : the student , who has since removed her @entity32 account , has been banned from returning to do work experience at @entity113 the director of prestigious @entity75 , @entity115 , said : @entity8 entered our college in 2012			1
now she is a third year student , studying to be a nurse			1
‘ ‘ we had never problems with her as a student , ’ she said			2
‘ it is the first such case in the 177 - year history of our college			1
of course , social networks appeared not long ago			0
she added : ‘ there are internal rules for the students , about behaviour and clothes , but there are no rules about social networks			0
we could not even imagine such a thing could happen one day			0
’ the college director said it was now an ‘ open question ’ whether @entity23 would remain as a trainee nurse			1
@entity138 , a psychology lecturer at @entity139 , said : ‘ i think it is a sign of emotional and social immaturity , inanity			0
‘ it is just like when little children do not quite understand what they are doing			0
‘ her age tells us she is an adult , but in terms of psychology , the girl just does not understand that this is not right			0
’ he claimed : ’ it is a general problem of our young people			0
they are immature , their ethical boundaries are not fixed			0
‘ they hardly understand what is good and bad			0
but anyone can make a mistake			0
‘ if the girl thinks deeply about this mistake and realises what she did , she can still be a nurse in the future			2
