by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 14 may 2013 animal - lover : @entity3 's career at the @entity4 soured you had only to cross the threshold of the small rented @entity8 cottage where @entity3 lived with two of her daughters to appreciate the extraordinary extent of her devotion to animals			1
two huge dogs , a @entity15 and a @entity16 , would bound up the hallway to greet visitors			1
a pair of cats would leap onto anyone who settled down on the living room sofa			1
on the fridge , next to photos of her beloved horse , were newsletters for countless pet rescue centres and shelters which the 43 - year - old divorcee had donated to — and volunteered at — for her entire adult life			1
elsewhere were photos of @entity33 fulfilling a long - held ambition by qualifying as an @entity4 inspector in 2008 , and a certificate from the charity commending her rescue of an endangered lamb several months later			1
not so long ago , the framed mementoes were among this vivacious animal lover ’s most treasured personal possessions			1
but then her relationship with the @entity4 soured			1
now , following a tragic course of events , they bear witness to an ugly controversy that raises sobering questions about @entity52 ’s best - known animal charity			1
yesterday , it emerged that @entity33 , who also had two grown - up children , had been found hanged at the home in @entity56 , @entity57			1
she was discovered by a young family member on may 8			1
her death came five months after @entity33 , who was no longer an @entity4 employee , had stuck her head above the parapet to publicly accuse the charity of unnecessarily killing animals			1
in an interview with @entity66 , published in late december last year , she had described her horror , during her time as an @entity4 inspector , at having to euthanise what she called ‘ healthy animals ’			1
the decision to blow the whistle on her experience came as figures revealed that the charity puts down 53,000 animals a year — almost half of the number it takes in			1
the interview sparked widespread controversy			1
but the @entity4 responded by publicly attacking @entity33 ’s character and integrity			1
in a statement published on its website in early january , and widely circulated among animal rights extremists , the charity suggested she was a liar primarily motivated by malice			2
praised : @entity3 is given a certificate for rescuing a lamb while working for the animal welfare charity as an inspector ‘ please be aware that @entity3 is a disgruntled former employee of the @entity4 who was subject to a disciplinary investigation for alleged theft of animals			1
she left the organisation with matters still pending , ’ it began			1
over the days that followed , @entity33 went on to endure a torrent of abuse on @entity103 and @entity104 , telling friends that she was struggling to cope with the tide of hate mail , death threats , and abusive telephone calls			1
on her own @entity103 feed , she claimed that the @entity4 had ‘ ruined my life ’ and said that its pr statement was ‘ evil ’			2
weeks before taking her life , she complained of feeling ‘ bullied and harassed ’ and admitted that she was suffering from ‘ severe depression ’ , describing it as ‘ hardly surprising ’ given the pressure she had been put under			2
in a message on her @entity104 page the day before her body was found , she declared : ‘ that ’s it , i give up , i am unemployed , broke , struggling and allegedly “ damaged ”			1
’ @entity123 , a close friend , believes the ‘ damaged ’ comment refers to the @entity4 ’s depiction of her as a liar			2
‘ @entity129 was going through hell , ’ says @entity127 , who runs a cat sanctuary			2
‘ it was cruelty , plain and simple			2
we are totally shocked by her death			2
in my opinion , the people who drove her to this have blood on their hands			2
’ animal lover : ms @entity33 , 43 , was found hanged at her home in @entity57 last week another long - standing friend , @entity146 , described her victimisation as ‘ appalling ’ , adding : ‘ the last time i spoke to her , she was feeling very low			1
she was short of cash , was close to having to move home , and could n’t get work , because potential employers googled her name and found all sorts of nastiness			1
‘ she was very brave and spoke out for what she believed in , but she confided in me that she had received threatening emails from people who did n’t like what she had said			2
’ yesterday , the @entity4 would only say : ‘ we are saddened to hear of @entity3 ’s death			1
our thoughts are with her family at this very difficult time			2
’ @entity33 had joined the @entity4 as a trainee in 2007 , securing what she had always regarded as a dream job			2
yet after a brief honeymoon period , she started to find herself at odds with superiors			2
‘ @entity129 was a lovely person , who adored animals , ’ says one friend			2
‘ but she could also be a touch scatty , and sometimes did n’t do things exactly by the book			2
it started to upset her bosses			0
’ @entity33 is understood to have been particularly troubled by the number of animals @entity4 inspectors were required to euthanise			0
‘ she was desperate to avoid killing animals , particularly healthy ones , ’ says the friend			0
‘ at times , she re-homed them with other animal welfare organisations , rather than follow strict @entity4 procedures she felt would eventually lead to them being put down			0
’ that upset superiors , who allegedly began issuing regular complaints about wider aspects of @entity33 ’s conduct			0
she was disciplined for failing to follow guidelines about storing ammunition for the captive bolt gun used when euthanising animals			0
allegations : @entity3 , 43 , said she was forced to put down healthy pets during two years working for the charity ‘ i had accidentally put four bullets in my pocket , ’ she later claimed			1
and she was rebuked for refusing to issue a formal ‘ caution ’ to a devastated pensioner whose cat had contracted emphysema and was dying in his lap. ‘ the @entity4 … see every case as a chance to prosecute , to generate publicity for themselves , ’ she said about the case			0
her career came to an end after she was reprimanded for the theft of a tortoise , which she claimed to have taken home for safekeeping			1
after a year of negotiations , she resigned			0
around the same time , in 2010 , her boyfriend , @entity220 , was found dead			1
he also faced redundancy , and was troubled by their financial prospects , although the coroner recorded an open verdict			0
@entity33 discovered @entity220 ’s body at their home			1
friend @entity229 said : ‘ she never got over @entity232 ’s death			0
the problems with the @entity4 came not that long afterwards and she just could n’t cope any more			0
’ his death , along with her departure from the @entity4 , is believed to have led to a nervous breakdown			0
@entity33 consulted an employment lawyer and later claimed the charity offered her a pay - off			1
but she was required to sign a ‘ gagging clause ’ to prevent her publicly discussing her time at the charity			0
she allegedly declined , hoping to bring what she saw as the organisation ’s deficiencies to a wider audience			0
that process began in december , when she gave the interview to @entity66			1
afterwards , the @entity4 published its statement attacking her integrity — and then the abuse began			0
‘ you sold out ! ’ read one typical attack on @entity103 , along with : ‘ how much were you paid ? ’ when @entity33 replied that she had neither sought nor received payment for her story from the newspaper , the @entity103 user called her ‘ foul ’			0
so began a downward spiral that ended in her death last wednesday			0
astonishingly , her death is just one of several individuals who have been in conflict with the @entity4			0
in 2010 , a @entity267 pony breeder from @entity268 called @entity269 took his life after the charity confiscated his animals			0
later that year , a gamekeeper called @entity274 killed himself after being convicted of firearms offences following a raid on his home			1
and in 2012 @entity278 , a pig farmer being investigated by the @entity4 , shot himself in a field			0
in yet another case , which bears an eerie similarity to @entity33 ’s , a female @entity4 inspector called @entity283 was paid £ 30,000 by the charity after saying she was driven to attempt suicide by ‘ bullying ’ and ‘ sexual harassment ’			0
friends of @entity33 detect a pattern			0
‘ @entity129 was a wonderful woman , ’ says @entity290 , a barrister who knew her well			0
‘ i am proud to have been one of her many friends , and so sad to be saying she is yet another person who has been in conflict with the @entity4 then died by their own hand			0
i think this charity needs to have a very long hard look at itself			0
’ a coroner will take evidence on her death in the coming months			0
meanwhile @entity304 , editor of @entity306 magazine , a prominent figure in animal welfare circles and a friend of @entity129 ’s , last night called for a government inquiry into the @entity4 ’s behaviour			0
‘ it takes immense bravery to speak out when you think something is wrong — and while an organisation needs to be able to defend itself , it needs to be very careful it does n’t overstep the mark and crush genuine people possibly making valid points , ’ she said			0
‘ we will never forget @entity129 and i ’d like to feel sure she was n’t bullied by a charity that should be all about prevention of cruelty			0
‘ only an independent inquiry can achieve that			0

@entity3 , 43 , blew the whistle in a @entity66 interview
mother - of - four left final @entity104 message which said ' that 's it , i give up '
she was found hanged in her home in @entity56 , @entity57
