by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 23 april 2012 updated : 19:37 est , 23 april 2012 @entity1 has been overtaken by the @entity2 in a university league table published today			1
the ancient university was forced into third place behind the @entity2 and arch - rival @entity6 , which took top spot			1
a decline in the job prospects of @entity1 's graduates contributed to its slide from second place in last year 's table			1
third class : @entity1 has been overtaken by the @entity2 in a new university league table the prospects of @entity6 leavers suffered a lesser fall while the @entity2 , which concentrates on a narrower range of subjects , bucked the recession by increasing graduate employment rates			1
it is the first time in the 15 - year history of the tables , which rank universities on a range of measures including research quality , entry standards , staff - to - student ratios and job prospects , @entity1 has been beaten by the @entity2			1
the tables - part of the @entity36 - show how leading universities are toughening up entry requirements to counter rising a-level pass rates			0
the average student accepted to @entity6 now achieves the equivalent of almost five a grades			1
there are also wide variations in the likelihood of gaining a good degree - a first or 2.1 - depending on the university attended			0
@entity1 handed good degrees to 91 per cent of honours students and @entity6 87 per cent , while just 44 per cent of @entity51 graduates achieved the distinction			2
fall : a decline in job prospects for @entity1 students has been blamed for the university slipping to third in the tables			1
pictured is @entity59 , @entity1 despite relatively lowly positions in the tables , some universities gave out large numbers of firsts and 2.1s , with 69 per cent achieving good degrees at @entity64 , which was ranked 74th			2
the table , which ranks 116 universities at www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk , also showed stark differences in graduate job prospects			1
across all universities in the list , 63.7 per cent of leavers from the class of 2010 were working in graduate - level jobs or taking further qualifications six months after graduating			0
the rest were on the dole or under - employed in jobs unlikely to justify the time and expense of studying			0
embarrassment : @entity2 has come under fire for its close links to @entity83 at @entity85 , the figure was 41.1 per cent and @entity86 it was 41.9 per cent			1
in contrast , the @entity2 boasted the highest employment rate , with 87.8 per cent of graduates in good jobs or further study six months later - up from 84.1 per cent last year			2
average employment rates have declined from 68.6 per cent among the class of 2007			0
dr @entity94 , principal author of the guide , said rises and falls in the rankings were driven to a considerable extent by the recession			0
some had adapted to the changing financial climate by focusing sharply on the employability of their graduates			0
' the employment market for graduates remains challenging and this is reflected in the rankings			0
some universities have been more successful than others in adapting to the new conditions , ' he said			0
' league tables carry a health warning for good reason and the order at the top of the ranking should be treated with some discretion			0
' what is beyond dispute is that all three institutions - @entity6 , the @entity2 and @entity1 - are outstanding in their fields			1
the @entity2 's range of disciplines is less broad than @entity1 's , and it has a better record for graduate prospects			1
' he suggested employers with typically recruit @entity130 graduates may be struggling , affecting their employment rates			0
in separate listings covering 62 subjects , @entity6 takes top place in 30 of the 46 it offers , and is in the top ten for 46			2
the @entity2 is in the top ten for all twelve of the subjects offered and is top for three			0
@entity1 is in the leading 10 universities for all 32 of its subjects , and is placed first in 12			0
across all measures , the top ten universities were @entity6 , @entity2 , @entity1 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			1
@entity1 has previously been beaten in the table by @entity143 , in 1999 and 2000 , when it again took third place			2
however , @entity1 has taken top spot in the tables more times than @entity6 over the past decade			2
the new rankings are a boost for the @entity2 after it suffered acute embarrassment last year following revelations of extensive links to @entity83 's regime			1
it accepted a £ 1.5million donation from @entity163 , the son of the then @entity165 dictator , a year after @entity163 was awarded a phd and also agreed to a £ 2.2million contract with @entity165 to train its civil service .			0
