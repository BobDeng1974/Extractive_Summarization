click here to see our brilliant @entity2 service which includes this heat map from @entity5 @entity7 ’s @entity6 ensured justice was done just as the @entity10 @entity9 was about to be hit with yet another refereeing scandal			1
@entity14 referee @entity13 had risked mutiny inside @entity17 ’s @entity16 by wrongly ruling out two legitimate @entity19 goals for offside in the first half , both netted by @entity22 forward @entity23			1
so he – and @entity24 – would have been mightily relieved when @entity19 domination was eventually rewarded after an hour when @entity27 goalkeeper @entity26 pushed out a shot by @entity23 into the path of @entity6 to grab the rebound			1
the result leaves @entity7 favourites to qualify from @entity33 alongside @entity10 whom they face on tuesday in @entity36 and the goal celebration of tracksuited @entity7 coach @entity38 – roaring like a lion as heavy rain lashed down around him – became an instant hit on the internet			1
long wait : @entity6 ( left ) gives @entity7 the lead in the 61st minute ahead : @entity6 wheels away in celebration after given @entity7 a deserved lead in the @entity33 clash jubilant : the @entity7 players celebrates the opening goal with the substitutes on the sidelines bad day : @entity23 saw two seemingly fair goals disallowed during the first half @entity7 : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 ' ) , @entity65 , @entity38 , @entity23 , @entity6 ( @entity66 74 ' )			1
subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			0
booked : @entity59 goals : @entity6 61 ' @entity27 : @entity26 , @entity79 ( @entity80 45 ' ) , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 ( @entity85 79 ' ) , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity5 , @entity89			1
subs not used : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99			0
booked : @entity80 referee : @entity101 att : 39 , 216 more seriously , the performances of the officials will again be under the microscope following on from the opening game when @entity10 were wrongly awarded a match - changing penalty against @entity107 when @entity108 dived following a tussle by @entity110			0
if anything , the decisions made by @entity13 and his assistants were even worse , if not ultimately costly			0
and @entity38 made his displeasure clear despite his side ’s victory			0
‘ we scored two clear goals in the first half - frankly the refereeing took them away			2
there was only one team controlling the ball			0
' we could have scored more but we go into the next match with three points and very high spirits			0
the boys gave their souls on the pitch			0
’ twenty thousand @entity19 fans watched their team dominate a dismal @entity27 side who looked drained by a pre-tournament row over bonus payments that had delayed their arrival in south @entity137			1
the only thing stopping @entity7 and a handsome win in extremely wet conditions were the officials			2
strike : the @entity19 striker shoots and scores but his goal was disallowed he 's on ! @entity23 was clearly in an onside position as the cross came into the penalty area @entity149 : @entity7 's coach @entity38 ( right ) was right to feel aggrieved with several first half decisions hard luck : the @entity7 players claim for a handball during a controversial first half one to forget : @entity5 missed a glorious chance to give his side the lead in the first half they ruled out @entity23 ’ volley from @entity164 ’s cross after 11 minutes when he replays showed he was level with two @entity27 defenders			1
and @entity38 rightly went ballistic on the touchline after half - an - hour when @entity27 ’s @entity89 inadvertently flicked on a @entity19 corner for @entity23 to score from close range – only for the linesman to wrongly identify @entity89 as a @entity19 and put his flag up for offside			1
even so , @entity7 should have been ahead anyway given their possession , and @entity60 and @entity59 bizarrely got in each other ’s way when left unmarked at a set - piece			2
in contrast , @entity27 looked a shadow of the team that thrilled the world at @entity181 with @entity5 isolated up front			1
winner : @entity38 reacts to the final whistle as his team defeat @entity27 bad call : @entity23 ( right ) puts the ball in the net again but the goal was disallowed due to an offside beaten : @entity7 's second strike of the game was also controversially disallowed by the match official @entity7 were unlucky not to be ahead sooner , but they finally took the lead after a neat strike into an empty net from @entity197 here to find out more from our brilliant @entity2 service this one counts : @entity7 finally took the lead after this strike from @entity6 ( 19 ) still singing ? spectators sit under pouring rain as they watch the @entity33 match following the blunder that gave @entity10 a winning start in @entity210 on thursday , another decisive refereeing cock - up was the last thing the @entity9 needed			1
so it was to @entity7 ’s credit they kept going in the second half to get the win despite the earlier poor decisions			2
again , @entity23 was heavily involved in the breakthrough goal after an hour			2
the @entity220 player struck with his left foot and though former @entity223 goalkeeper @entity26 showed great reactions to save , @entity6 was positioned exactly where a fox - in - the - box should be			2
dangerous : former @entity227 midfielder @entity84 ( centre ) fouls @entity23 wet : @entity23 ( left ) challenges @entity84 in the rain at the @entity230 das @entity16 defeat : the @entity27 players stand dejected after going down 1 - 0 against @entity7 the best - paid player in @entity234 history with @entity137 kept calm to slot home the rebound from eight yards and trigger huge celebrations among the majority of supporters in the stadium			1
in an instant , @entity6 , who scored both goals for @entity7 when they beat @entity10 to win gold at the @entity244 , justified @entity38 ’s decision to start him ahead of @entity247 ’s @entity66			1
and the coach shouted and waved his arms like a madman to celebrate , his joy instantly going viral around the world			0
enough : match referee @entity13 has a word with @entity27 's @entity255 - @entity254 chance : @entity59 ( right ) reacts after missing a chance as the @entity27 keeper looks on @entity27 had a late chance to draw level but @entity88 failed to convert a header in injury - time , which would have been the greatest injustice of all			2
the @entity264 included @entity265 ’s @entity83 and @entity267 midfielder @entity84 but rarely looked like troubling @entity7 , whose charismatic coach boasted before the tournament that @entity7 are genuine @entity9 contenders			0
time to party : @entity7 's players celebrates @entity6 's crucial winning goal on friday @entity6 , who scored both goals for @entity7 when they beat @entity10 to win gold at the @entity244 , was picked ahead of @entity66 for exactly that type of penalty - area finishing			1
the @entity247 man had to be content with a late came off the bench but as bare - chested @entity19 supporters celebrated in the incessant downpour , there will be a major inquest in the @entity27 ranks			0
they were abysmal as if money disputes had affected morale			0
their only genuine sights of goal in the second half came when @entity265 defender @entity83 saw his deflected shot flash narrowly wide and @entity88 failed to convert a header in injury - time , but that going in would have been the greatest injustice of all			0
battle : @entity295 ( left ) controls the ball as @entity63 gives chase during the first half			0

@entity6 scores winning goal for @entity7 against @entity27
@entity23 scores two first half goals but both efforts are disallowed
@entity5 misses golden opportunity to give his side the lead in the first half
