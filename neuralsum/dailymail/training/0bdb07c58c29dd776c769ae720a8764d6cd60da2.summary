a brisk long walk is as good as a run for cutting the risk of heart disease , researchers say			1
this is because the most important factor is not intensity but the total energy used			1
in the first study of its kind , researchers found that walking briskly can lower the risk of high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes – all problems that can lead to heart disease – as much as running does			1
walking can lower the risk of heart - related diseases just as much running , @entity20 researchers have found it had been thought that running was superior because runners travel further			1
but the benefits of both types of regular exercise were compared among 48,000 adults and found to be almost the same			2
so long as the energy used is similar , the health boost is similar , says a report in the @entity35 journal @entity36			2
@entity37 , of @entity38 in @entity39 , said the findings were surprising but showed the key factor was the number of calories worked off in each form of activity			1
‘ walking and running provide an ideal test of the health benefits ... because they involve the same muscle groups and the same activities performed at different intensities , ’ he said			1
he estimates a person would need to walk 4.3 miles at a brisk pace to have the same amount of exercise as running 3 miles			2
it would take twice as long – around an hour and 15 minutes instead of 38 minutes , he said			0
the six - year study analysed 33,060 runners and 15,045 walkers			2
when the same total energy was used for moderate - intensity walking as for vigorous - intensity running , it resulted in similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes and , possibly , coronary heart disease			1
running was thought to be superior because runners travel further but research has found that is not the case unlike previous studies , the researchers assessed walking and running by distance , not by time			1
dr @entity37 said : ‘ the more the runners ran and the walkers walked , the better off they were in health benefits			0
if the amount of energy expended was the same between the two groups , then the health benefits were comparable			2
’ among runners , about half were men			0
their average age was 48 for men and 41 for women			0
of the walkers , only 21 per cent were men			0
average ages were 62 for men and 53 for women			0
the walkers were more likely to be overweight and to smoke			0
the researchers found that runners ’ risk of high blood pressure was reduced by 4.2 per cent , high cholesterol by 4.3 per cent , diabetes by 12.1 per cent and coronary heart disease by 4.5 per cent			1
among walkers , the risk of high blood pressure was cut by 7.2 per cent , high cholesterol by 7 per cent , diabetes by 12.3 per cent and coronary heart disease by 9.3 per cent			1
but because of the different make - up of the two groups , the results are statistically equivalent , researchers say			0
dr @entity37 said the snag is that runners often expend more energy than walkers – thus reaping more gains			0
‘ walking may be a more sustainable activity for some people , ’ he said			0
‘ however , those who choose running end up exercising twice as much as those that choose walking			1
this is probably because they can do twice as much in an hour			0
’ official @entity127 guidelines say people should do 150 minutes of moderate , or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise every week – but three in four @entity127 fail to achieve this			0
@entity131 , of the @entity132 , said the findings show ‘ that any brisk physical activity , not just those long , exhausting runs , can be great news for your heart health			0
‘ we know the best type of activity for your heart is moderate - intensity aerobic activity and that includes walking – as long as you feel warmer , breathe harder and your heart beats faster than usual			2
‘ whether it ’s walking , jogging or running , staying active will help control your weight , reduce blood pressure and cholesterol , and improve your mental health			1

researchers found walking is just as good as running in reducing risk of high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes
study by @entity38 in @entity39 found total energy used was more important than intensity
