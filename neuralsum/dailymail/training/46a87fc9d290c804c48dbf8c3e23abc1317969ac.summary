by @entity0 the house where @entity5 student @entity3 was brutally murdered has been put up for sale by its owner for Â£ 384,000 , it emerged today			1
with its white washed stone walls and spectacular views of the nearby rolling countryside , the ten bedroom property would make an ideal holiday home but with its grim background potential buyers maybe put off			1
a ' for sale ' sign went up outside @entity18 in @entity19 earlier this week and the house is also being advertised on a local estate agents website but there is no obviously mention of @entity3 's murder in november 2007 - she was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom			1
for sale : the property in @entity19 , @entity30 , where @entity3 was found dead in 2007 has been put on the market by its elderly owner victim : @entity5 student @entity3 was found dead in her bedroom with a slit throat @entity35 , 70 , owner of the house , contacted an estate agent earlier this month with a view to selling the property as she lives in 150 miles away in @entity40 and no longer wants anything to do with it			1
the advert describes the two storey property as ' close to the university of foreigners , with a complex character composed of two independent properties , with the prospect of converting into one or making into three , comes with 5,000mq2 of land and parking for seven cars			0
@entity3 moved into the house in august 2007 after spotting an advert for it shortly after arriving in @entity19 where she was due to spend a year studying at the university and her fellow tenants were two @entity30 women and @entity59 student @entity58			2
within weeks of moving in @entity3 was dead and @entity60 , now 26 , was charged with murdering and sexually assaulting her , with her then boyfriend @entity62 , 30 , and they were both initially convicted but then had their convictions quashed two years ago but that was subsequently overturned earlier this year			2
suspects : @entity58 , left , and her then - boyfriend @entity62 pictured outside the property in the days after @entity3 was found dead in court : @entity58 and @entity62 , pictured in 2008 , were both convicted of @entity3 's murder but their convictions were quashed two years ago for two years following the murder the house was under a police confiscation order before it was then returned to mrs @entity75 who eventually re-let it at a reduced price to immigrant tenants from @entity79 and the @entity80 who were students at the nearby university			1
since then there has been a steady flow of tenants in and out of the house but it has also been noted for several high profile incidents including being broken into by @entity87 several times as well as most recently last month when the current tenants were rushed to hospital after being overcome by carbon monoxide from a faulty heater			0
the family of eight @entity94 including two newborn babies were living in the basement flat of the house but the upper floor where @entity3 and @entity60 lived is currently unoccupied			0
estate agent @entity99 , who is handing the sale , said : ' we 've not had any calls yet about the property but it is still early days			0
ongoing : @entity58 , pictured in april this year during an interview with @entity107 ' @entity106 , will find out the verdict of an appeal court over @entity3 's murder next month @entity58 , pictured in april 2013 , has claimed she was ' physiologically tortured ' by police investigating the death of @entity3 ' the sign only went up earlier his week and it 's online as well but @entity116 has been in between as well so i 'm hoping that once the holidays are over we will get some interest			2
' it 's not a good time of year to market a house but i 'm sure we will get calls about it - the house is in excellent position and would make an ideal holiday home or if someone wants to convert it they could get two possibly three separate units and then rent them out to students - it 's very close to the university and the centre of town			1
' there has been some interest via the internet and i hope that is from genuine buyers as opposed to people having a morbid curiosity in the history of the house			0
' i have a feeling though that because of its history the house will be difficult to sell but it should be said that it is in excellent condition and a very good buy for its location			0
' an appeal court is expected to return its verdict on the fresh hearing against @entity60 and @entity62 next month .			0

@entity35 , 70 , has contacted estate agents about selling the property
a ' for sale ' sign was this week placed outside @entity18 in @entity19
it is an ideal holiday home but its grim history may put off potential buyers
@entity3 was found dead in her bedroom at the house in 2007
