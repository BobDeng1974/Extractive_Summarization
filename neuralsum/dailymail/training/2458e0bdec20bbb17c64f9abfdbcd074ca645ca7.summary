@entity0 says he was saddened that @entity1 are out of the @entity2 but is determined that @entity3 will make it into the knock - out stages			1
@entity3 take on @entity6 in @entity7 tomorrow and a win will guarantee a place in the last 16			1
@entity10 skipper @entity0 has an @entity12 wife , @entity11 , and had hoped @entity14 's side would progress			1
@entity0 told a news conference : ' my wife is @entity12 and although i like to believe my kids are @entity19 , she thinks they are @entity12 too			1
' the 28 - year - old , who has had treatment for a groin strain last week following the 2 - 1 win over @entity38 , says he is feeling ' good ' and relishing the prospect of playing in the @entity40			1
he added : ' i have played in a lot of the big stadiums in @entity43 and the most mythical stadiums in the world are @entity46 and @entity40 so this is something very special			0
' to face off against @entity6 there will be really special , it was one of my boyhood dreams coming true just to walk on that sacred pitch and it will be very special - and not just for the @entity19 players			2
' @entity3 's first match brought some criticism about a lack of style but @entity0 said the players are concentrating only on getting out of the group			1
positive about @entity3 's chances : @entity0 is confident his team will progress to the next round talent : @entity23 will be @entity3 's main striker in the absence of the injured @entity66 he said : ' we are not going to prove ourselves by style , only results			1
how have @entity71 , @entity1 , @entity72 , even @entity70 got on ? countries have to focus on getting through the group stage			0

' @entity0 also tried to ease the burden of expectation on @entity23 , @entity3 's main striker in the absence of the injured @entity66 , who struggled to impose himself against @entity38			1
' he has a tremendous amount of talent but for us it 's about not putting pressure on a 21 - year - old kid to do it for us at a @entity2 , a lot of other people will take the responsibility , ' he said			2
gutted : @entity95 has apologised to @entity1 fans on his @entity98 page ' he 's only 21 so i think he probably has two or more @entity100 so there is no pressure on his shoulders			0
if he performs well for us we will be happy , but the most important thing is he puts his performance for the benefit of the group and he 'll be okay			0
' @entity3 coach @entity109 is expecting a tactical battle against his @entity6 counterpart @entity111			2
he said : ' it could be a very tactical match , @entity111 has a great track record at some great clubs and we will see what his approach is on the pitch			0
' we saw @entity6 play @entity118 in quite a rigid formation but we will wait to see against us			0
the most important thing for us is we have to shut down space			0
' preparing : @entity0 and team - mate @entity122 are readying themselves for their game against @entity6 mucking about : @entity126 playing with a sprinkler during a training session			0
