they could be precious exhibits in a museum or dusty relics of history from a national archive			2
but @entity5 put together this @entity7 collection from more unlikely locations … fishing the discarded photographs out of rubbish bins during his 36 years as a dustman			1
mr @entity5 found his first few photos and letters during the 1970s , and over the next three decades made it his mission to try to save anything of a similar nature he spotted on his rounds			1
he has now found more than 5,000 photographs , recording everything from the horror of the trenches to haunting images of young men smiling together before battle			1
artefacts : @entity29 soldiers sent pictures like this one as postcards from the front line			1
this man sits next to this ammunition from 1916 treasure trove : pictures like this one show the @entity37 on a troop train before battle at @entity40 in 1914 horrifying : this salvaged image shows the terrible conditions from the @entity7 , where this trench is strewn with bodies and rubbish while servicemen watch on remarkable treasure trove : @entity48 @entity5 spent 36 years saving @entity7 pictures thrown away as veterans of the conflict passed away he believes as soldiers from the conflict grew old and died a lot of their remarkable memorabilia was often thrown out , especially in the 1970s and 1980s			1
but over three decades he made it his mission to try and save anything he spotted which otherwise could have been lost forever			0
mr @entity5 , from @entity59 , said his collection is not just photographs - it contains medals , letters and even a handkerchief with a bullet hole found in the rubbish			1
' i found the majority of the photographs on the " dust " during the 70s and 80s when those who fought in @entity7 were probably passing away , ' he said			1
' probably the boys working today will find them from @entity75 ' in the early days we used to carry the bins on our shoulders			0
therefore , when we emptied the bins you used to see the paperwork coming out , and the photographs			2
' you did n't find them all the time because the only time you were aware of some was when they started to be mashed up			0
' we had relatives that died in both the @entity88 and of course it means something to keep these memories alive			0
incredible : this picture , along with thousands of others , were tossed in the rubbish when the soldiers passed away , mr @entity5 said men in uniform : soldiers from all over the world served in the conflict , seen here in various uniforms before and after battle in @entity105 victims of war : this picture was found of @entity109 , from @entity110 in @entity111 , who was ' badly wounded ' in the war but apparently survived the conflict ' there is nothing like being able to pick up and examine an object or picture , see it with your own eyes , understand how it works and was used			1
if everything is thrown away future generations will not be able to have this joy or knowledge			0
' i 've got photographs from the trenches , photographs from @entity129 @entity128 regiments and pictures from the @entity29			1
' the @entity29 soldiers used the pictures almost like postcards , they would write their unit and even where they were and when			1
the @entity137 side were n't allowed to do that			0
' i have not given a great deal of thought about what will happen to my collection , but i do have children and grandchildren			0
not to mention several collecting friends who keep dropping hints ' the trouble is , if it is donated to a museum most things will never be seen again , just stored and forgotten and no joy to anyone			0
' line - up : this group of men appear to be submariners from a torpedo team - a weapon used by both sides in the @entity7 relic : this postcard was sent by a soldier from the front line to family members in @entity164 , @entity165			0
it was also found in the bin by mr @entity5 ammunition : among items that the eagle - eyed gunman has found includes this and also a handkerchief pierced by one war wounds : this @entity137 @entity175 booklet along with these pictures of a man and his injured legs are contained in the 5,000 picture archive rescued from the bin : this beautifully written notebook and letter sent to ' may ' on paper headed with @entity184 and the motto ' for @entity186 , home , and native land ' were saved as well as being an amazing national record of the 1914 - 18 conflict , it could also be worth thousands as just one picture can sell for as much as £ 30 to collectors			1
@entity5 , who considers himself a custodian of the collection , said the value for him was in saving something so important which could otherwise have never been seen again			1
he said : ' i have a long photograph like the kind that would have been in a frame hanging on a wall of a complete squadron of the @entity204 - it was just lying on the landfill			2
' in another there 's some soldiers posing with a massive naval gun - it turned out the picture was actually taken by a photographer from near my home			2
' i actually found some letters that were just with some papers in a bin			2
they were designs for the memorial plaques for medals killed in the war			0
' having been to auctions and postcard sales these kind of photographs used to go for 20 to 50p in the old days			2
now if you have something like a picture of a tank or something else it can go for £ 30 each			0
' weaponry : these wo officers stand in front of a huge tank stood in from of a crater surrounded by debris destroyed : two men stand next to a damaged cannon which had sunk into the mud of the @entity105 battlefield powerful : mr @entity5 spent more than three decades trying to save items like this which otherwise could have been lost forever without his intervention historic : soldiers wearing kilts worn by @entity247 regiments sleep or try to relax in the trenches while battle goes on around them the hoarder has said the treasure of his collection was a series of photographs of the @entity37 , which fought a battle at @entity40 in 1914			1
when he discovered his first letter he said : ' i looked at it , i thought it was interesting - this was the @entity7			0
' once i 've undone it , i found out the chap was killed in action			2
this was his last letter			0
i thought well hang on a minute , you ca n't throw that sort of stuff away			0
' alternative transport : a tank towing a field gun alongside an @entity128 soldier and his camel in around 1917 in memoriam : a note sent to one grieving family by @entity279 , thanking them for their son 's sacrifice for his country one record : an @entity287 record book entitled @entity288 , once belonging to a soldier , was also discovered by mr @entity5 couple : a young seaman pictured arm in arm with his sweetheart ( left ) and proudly showing off his three years good conduct stripe ( right ) trench warfare : one soldier from a @entity247 regiment finds time to smoke a pipe as he and his comrades work in a trench near a @entity303 farm			1

@entity5 spent years saving images of soldiers from landfill because he could not bear to see them destroyed
' i found the majority of photographs in the 70s and 80s when those who fought were probably passing away '
as well as pictures he has also found letters , postcards and even bullets hidden in the rubbish
