‘ we 're going to other regions soon , but are starting with handful of countries to make sure we can scale the experience , ’ an @entity1 spokesman told @entity59			0
‘ @entity1 has 65 percent of its users overseas , so an international launch , while different , is actually not all that out of order with what we do			0
’ the @entity1 representative elaborated that the three countries were selected not only because of their geographical diversity , but also for their tight - knit communities			0
the app ’s launch follows @entity76 ’s recent foray into ephemeral messaging with @entity78			1

some say @entity3 ’s functionality is also similar to @entity160 , a one tap messaging app by the makers of @entity163			2
@entity76 and @entity1 both hope that @entity3 will become more successful than @entity76 ’s previous ill - fated @entity7 clone , @entity165			1
@entity1 plans to promote @entity3 at the top of every user 's @entity1 feed			2
