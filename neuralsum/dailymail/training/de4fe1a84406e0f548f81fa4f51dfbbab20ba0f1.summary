doctors may soon be able to diagnose @entity1 in children with a simple brain scan			1
the breakthrough was made after scientists found the brains of children and teenagers with the condition develop more slowly than other youngsters of the same age			1
this means the connections between and within key brain networks are less developed - and may explain common characteristics of the condition , such as struggling to focus			1
@entity18 researchers analysed brain scans of 323 children with and without adhd and found that key connections in the brains of those with the disorder developed more slowly than those without it			1
in the future , brain scan could help diagnose the condition , they said brain networks are a cluster of pathways that form in the brain as it develops			1
different pathways will control different processes - such as analysing an image , or accessing a memory			0
different brain networks connect with others for the brain to perform a function			1
for example , when we look at a picture , one pathway in our brain will be processing taking in the colours and shapes , and another pathway might be recalling memories associated with them			0
researchers found that the brains of children with @entity1 showed less mature connections between a brain network that controls internal thoughts - such as daydreaming - and brain networks that allow a person to focus on external tasks			1
this lag may help explain why people with @entity1 get easily distracted or struggle to stay focused , researchers said			1
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity1 ) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness			2
common symptoms of @entity1 include : @entity1 can occur in people of any intellectual ability , although it is more common in people with learning difficulties			2
people with @entity1 may also have additional problems , such as sleep and anxiety disorders			0
symptoms of @entity1 tend to be first noticed at an early age , and may become more noticeable when a child 's circumstances change , such as when they start school			0
most cases are diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 12			0
the symptoms of @entity1 usually improve with age , but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age will continue to experience problems			2
source : @entity92 and the new findings may one day allow doctors to use brain scans to diagnose @entity1 , and track how well patients respond to treatment			1
at the moment , adhd in children is diagnosed when a gp who has talked through the symptoms with the child 's parents decides it is appropriate to refer them to a specialist - such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist - for a formal assessment			0
the assessment would be based on a discussion or an observation of the child 's symptoms			0
a diagnosis based on a ' biomarker ' - defined as a measureable indication of a condition - does n't yet exist for @entity1 , or any other psychiatric condition			1
around three to seven per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity121 , with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school			0
the study used computing techniques to analyse a pool of brain scans that were publicly shared for scientists to study			0
the team looked at the brain scans of 275 children and teenagers with adhd and 48 others without it			0
they used ' connectomic ' methods that can map the connections between networks in the brain			2
the researchers found lags in the development of connections within the internally - focused network , called the ' default mode network ' and the devlopement of connections between this and networks which process externally - focused tasks , called ' task - positive networks '			1
the findings could help further research looking into how @entity1 develops from childhood into adulthood			0
some children or teenagers grow out of the disorder , while others have @entity1 throughout adulthood			2
indeed , studying the way that brain networks mature in @entity1 could help experts find out why some children grow out of @entity1 , said dr @entity169 , from @entity171 's @entity170			1
the findings could help understand other disorders that are caused in differences in the connections in the brain , including autism and schizophrenia he said : ' we and others are interested in understanding the neural mechanisms of @entity1 in hopes that we can contribute to better diagnosis and treatment			1
' but without the database of @entity188 images , and the spirit of collaboration that allowed them to be compiled and shared , we would never have reached this point			0
' it is particularly noteworthy that the networks we found to have lagging maturation in @entity1 are linked to the very behaviours that are the symptoms of @entity1			2
' he added : ' the results of this study set the stage for the next phase of this research , which is to examine individual components of the networks that have the maturational lag			0
' he said that ' connectomics ' could be used to examine other disorders that are caused in differences in the connections in the brain , including autism and schizophrenia			2
the study was published in the @entity214 ,			0

@entity216 would be the first using a brain scan to diagnose this type of condition
scientists found brains of children with @entity1 develop more slowly
in particular , the connections within and between key ' brain networks ' mature more slowly in children with the condition
may explain why those with @entity1 get easily distracted or struggle to focus
analysis of brain connections could be used to understand and treat other psychiatric conditions like autism and schizophrenia , say researchers
