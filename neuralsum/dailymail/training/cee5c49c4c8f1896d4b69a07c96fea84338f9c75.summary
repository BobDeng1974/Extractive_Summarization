four of the eight @entity28 battleships at the base were sunk in the surprise assault , as well as several cruisers , destroyers and anti-aircraft ships			1

the following day , december 8 , the @entity11 declared war on @entity19 after president @entity40 declared the attack ' a date which will live in infamy '			1
previously , the @entity11 had pursued a policy of isolationism and kept out of the war			1
but instead of deterring the @entity11 from stopping @entity19 's plans to expand its empire , the attack galvanised @entity11 behind the war and led , ultimately , to the two atomic bombs dropped on @entity50 in 1945			1
although tensions between @entity19 and the @entity11 had increased and conflict was expected , most thought an attack would come in the @entity54 rather than in @entity21			1
most of the 12 ships that sank or were beached during the two - hour attack on december 7 , 1941 , have since been removed from the harbor , their metal hulls salvaged for scrap			1
only the @entity6 and the @entity61 remain in the water			2
nearly half of those who died were onboard the battleship @entity61 , which was sunk early in attack by torpedo bombers with the loss of 1,177 of its 1,400 crew			2

one of them , @entity127 , describes being confronted by pandemonium after he rushed on deck as an 18 - year - old during the attack			2
