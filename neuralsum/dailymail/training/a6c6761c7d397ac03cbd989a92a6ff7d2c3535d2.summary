by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 13:16 est , 4 march 2014 remorse : sir @entity3 has spoken of his ' bitter regret ' over not speaking to patients and their families affected during the @entity8 scandal outgoing @entity9 boss sir @entity3 has spoken of his ' bitter regret ' over not speaking to patients and their families who were so badly treated during the @entity7			1
@entity9 @entity12 ’s chief executive admitted his response to the @entity15 report – which revealed serious and systematic failures in care - had been one of the hardest lessons he learned during his 36 - year career with the @entity9			2
sir @entity3 said not talking to campaigners and other patients was his ' biggest mistake ' of his service			1
he avoided speaking to those affected because he did not want to be embroiled in a media circus - something he now says was the ' wrong call '			1
sir @entity3 , who came under intense scrutiny for his role in the fiasco , spoke candidly and at length about his role in the scandal at a health care conference in @entity37			1
with just 27 days left in his post , sir @entity3 spoke about a visit to the troubled hospital after a damning report into @entity8 was published in 2009			1
he told delegates at the @entity43 in @entity37 : ' the biggest and most obvious mistake that i made was when it became clear when the @entity47 reported on @entity48			2
' i went to the hospital and i did n't seek out the patients representatives and the people who were in @entity9 , and i did n't do it because i made the wrong call			1
' at the time , @entity53 had been out and it had been turned into a media circus and i judged i did n't want to be involved in a media circus and i was wrong , i was absolutely wrong			1
' because one of the things i leaned , and i have determinedly done it since then , is that there is no shortcut to understanding and talking to patients and relatives and people , there is no shortcut to it			2
' i did n't do it and then i got myself into a tangle of talking to people through the media , and that continues to be a very bad thing			2
but @entity75 , who set up the campaign group cure the @entity9 after her mother @entity77 died at the hospital , said sir @entity3 had ' ample opportunity ' to speak to the campaign group but never chose to do so ' that was a mistake that i made that i bitterly , bitterly regret			1
' but @entity75 , who set up the campaign group cure the @entity9 after her mother @entity77 died at the hospital , said that sir @entity3 had ' ample opportunity ' to speak to the campaign group but never chose to do so			1
' it is very easy to say when he is leaving and looking for a consultancy role , ' she said			2
' he had ample opportunity to come and meet us			0
' @entity53 did not come to meet us and it was not a media circus			1
' despite his regrets , sir @entity3 insisted he was right not to resign at the time			1
defiant : despite his regrets , sir @entity3 insisted today he was right not to resign at the time he said : ' i ’ve had some uncomfortable moments over all this			1
and if people and families of patients want to have a go at me , i accept that and will take it			0
' but i decided to stay as i thought there was a danger the fallout from @entity48 could turn very horrible for the @entity9 overall , when we could use the report to make positive changes			2
' i thought it would be irresponsible to wander off at that moment			0
but i am a human being and you can not read the stuff about people being injured and harmed without being upset			0
i accept i made some mistakes in all that			0
” in the past , sir @entity3 said that part of his decision to stand down was driven by ' becoming the story ' in the wake of the scandal			1
@entity48 was the focus of one of the biggest scandals in the history of the @entity9			2
inquiries into the scandal revealed that hundreds more people died at the trust than would have been expected			0
some patients were left lying in urine and excrement for days , forced to drink water out of vases or given the wrong medication			2
the 2009 investigation by the @entity135 found that between 400 and 1,200 more people died at the trust than would have been expected			0
and @entity137 , chair of the public inquiry , highlighted the ' appalling and unnecessary suffering ' of hundreds of patients			0
the trust was recently dissolved and key services will move to neighbouring hospitals			0
campaigners called for sir @entity3 to be sacked after the publication of the public inquiry report into @entity145			1
he was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for the trust for a short period while patients were being mistreated			0
speaking about his short tenure in the @entity152 , sir @entity3 said : ' this is a hard conversation to have because whatever you say you sound defensive			1
campaigners called for sir @entity3 to be sacked after the publication of the public inquiry report into @entity145			1
' i was the chief executive of the @entity158 and @entity157 , a pretty successful strategic health authority in lots of ways , and i was asked to take on the responsibilities for @entity163 and @entity164 and @entity165 , as well as my job			0
i did each of them on one day a week			0
' it was just closing them down because there had already been the decision made to reorganise them			0
' clearly i should have done more and i do n't deny any of that at all			0
' i worked in @entity158 and @entity174 for thee years and about eight months in the rest of the @entity176			0
' with hindsight now , we should have taken more action quicker			0

sir @entity3 said today that not talking to campaigners and other patients was his ' biggest mistake ' during his 36 years of service in the @entity9
says reason is because he did n't want to be embroiled in a media circus
now says this was the ' wrong call ' and he ' bitterly regrets it '
but *critics* argue he has only spoken out now because he is leaving post
