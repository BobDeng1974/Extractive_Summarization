' the politician made his dramatic claims as court papers alleged that private investigator @entity31 provided the @entity32 with daily transcripts of hacked messages			1
the papers said voicemail interception was approved by at least two executives , the @entity35 reported			0
three senior figures figures on the paper were in frequent contact with @entity31 , it is claimed			2
the documents say he entered into a conspiracy with executives and ' agreed to provide daily transcripts of voicemail messages to [ @entity50 ] journalists			1

he said : ' senior figures at @entity2 ordered - we know this for sure - the mass destruction of evidence			1
' the clear , incontrovertible evidence of corrupt payments to police , which @entity2 had garnered together , they gave to lawyers and squirrelled away and only revealed to the public very recently - i believe that aspect is one of the things that the authorities in the @entity53 should be investigating because i do n't believe that a single member of the board of directors of @entity57 took their responsibilities in this regard seriously enough to prevent the payment of corrupt officials			2
' mr @entity0 said police apparently told @entity101 about the original phone hacking investigation as the @entity5 politician spoke out , mr @entity103 ordered that previously redacted court documents submitted for a phone - hacking case in the @entity107 should be released			1

mr @entity0 said : ' this is like the @entity141 going to @entity142 and telling him that he 's got a bit of information on what his family has been up to			0
