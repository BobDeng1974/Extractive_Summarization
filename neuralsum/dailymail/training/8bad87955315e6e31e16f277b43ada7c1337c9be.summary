last month , dark knight director @entity0 unveiled his next science - fiction blockbuster			2
called @entity4 , it envisages a future where travel to other stars is not only a possibility but a necessity , and tasks actor @entity10 with leading the main mission			2
but a @entity13 scientist claims such a mission is n’t necessarily just something reserved for science fiction - and has revealed a @entity18 - style ship that could make interstellar travel a reality			1
pictured is an illustration of dr @entity24 's @entity23 , an interstellar ship drawn by artist @entity26 that could be an accurate representation of what the first mission beyond the solar system will look like			1
the @entity23 is a theory - fitting concept for a faster than light ( @entity32 ) ship dr @entity24 is famous for suggesting that faster than light ( @entity32 ) travel is possible			1
the 100 - year @entity36 is a joint endeavour run by @entity38 , @entity13 , @entity4 and the @entity39			1
announced in january 2012 , the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112			0
to do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies , including ‘ warping ’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster - than - light speeds			2
the project is also considering building ‘ generation ships ’ that move slowly but have a self - sustainable long - term population			0
to date @entity13 has contributed $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) to the project and @entity38 $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 )			0
using something known as an @entity57 drive , named after a @entity59 theoretical physicist of the same name , dr @entity24 said it is possible to ‘ bend ’ space - time , and cover large distances almost instantly			1
this , in essence , would allow a spaceship to travel almost anywhere in a tiny fraction of the time it would take a conventional spacecraft			2
the ship in @entity0 ’s @entity4 movie , as well as those in @entity18 , employ a warp engine			1
and , in a series of new renders , dr @entity24 reveals how a real spacecraft dubbed the @entity23 could do the same thing			1
the images are based on the artist who created the original look for the famous @entity82 ship from @entity18 - @entity83			1
to make the latest renders dr @entity24 employed the help of artist @entity26 and graphic designer @entity85			1
the ship has a number of features that make interstellar travel possible			2
this includes the two rings surrounding the central spacecraft - these are known as an @entity57 drive and are used to ' warp ' space - time and travel many light years in a matter of days the engine for dr @entity24 's @entity99 is based on something known as the @entity57 drive			1
as shown in the illustration above this stretches space - time in a wave that causes the fabric of space - time ahead to contract while expanding the space behind , theoretically allowing ' faster than light ' travel although the speed of light is seen as an absolute , dr @entity24 was inspired by @entity108 , who postulated a theory that allowed for faster than light travel but without contradicting @entity111			1
@entity108 's theory was published in 1994 and involved enormous amounts of energy being used to expand and contract space itself - thereby generating a ' warp bubble ' in which a spacecraft would travel			1
allowing space and time to act as the propellant by pulling the craft through the bubble would be like stepping on an escalator			0
despite dr @entity108 stating his theory was simply conjecture , dr @entity24 thinks he and his team are edging towards making the realm of warp speed attainable			2
this illustration shows dr @entity24 's design in its entirety			1
struts around the spacecraft show how it would be directly attached to the rings			0
at the front is the ' bridge ' where the crew would conduct operations on the spacecraft			0
towards the back is the cargo area where so - called exotic matter for fuel would be stored according to @entity147 , their engine could get to @entity148 in two weeks as measured by clocks on @entity150			2
the process of going to warp is also one that is smooth , rather than using a massive amount of acceleration in a short amount of time			0
' when you turn the field on , everybody does n't go slamming against the bulkhead , which would be a very short and sad trip , ' dr @entity24 said			2
however , dr @entity24 admits his research is still small - scale and is light years away from any type of engine that could be constructed into a spaceship like the @entity82			1
in @entity0 's upcoming film @entity168 , due for release in november , a team of astronauts undertake a mission beyond the stars to save humanity			2
to get there they use an @entity57 drive , shown above in a clip from the film - the same engine envisaged by @entity179 of @entity13 for his @entity18 - style spacecraft the ship at the centre of dr @entity24 's @entity23 would need to be small enough to fit inside the rings and it would need to not stick out too much			1
this is because when the rings are activated they will create a ' warp bubble ' , and anything outside of this will be cut off when the jump is made , according to dr @entity24 look familiar ? dr @entity24 's design for the @entity23 bears a striking similarity to the @entity82 as seen in various @entity18 tv shows such as @entity18 : the @entity193 , seen here			1
in the show this science vessel was used to ' explore strange new worlds ' and ' seek out new life and new civilisation ' to make the dream a reality dr @entity24 has laid out a road map with important milestones that will need to be met along the way to achieving true interstellar travel			1
this begins with tests on @entity150 to prove the technology is possible			0
these initial experiments are very crude and very basic - but , if proved , there is , in theory , no limit to how it can be applied			0
the next step will be to use the warp technology on a spacecraft and complete a short trip to the moon , followed by a trip to @entity218			0
this would ultimately test the technologies that would be necessary to complete ‘ jumps ’ beyond the solar system and reach destinations in a matter of months , weeks or even days			0
illustrated here is a previous design from dr @entity24 and @entity227			1
this concept had a number of flaws			0
first , the rings were too thin , meaning they would have needed too much energy for warp travell			0
second , part of the ship extends out of the rings , which would have been cut off when the ' warp bubble ' was created the main limitation is energy - previously it was thought mass equivalent to a planet would be necessary to provide the energy required for a warp jump			0
but revised suggestions suggest mass similar in size to a car might be more realistic			0
the research has done enough to pique the interest of @entity13 and other agencies			0
the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , for instance , is currently carrying out the 100 - year - starship project with a view to sending humans outside the solar system at the turn of the next century			0
the rings around the spacecraft ( shown ) would actually shift the surrounding space			0
the drive would require something known as exotic matter to work , hypothetical particles that violate the known laws of physics ( possibly such as dark matter ) , but as of yet none have been found or created the main limitation of the concept , ( pictured ) is energy - previously it was thought mass equivalent to a planet would be necessary to provide the energy required for a warp jump			0
but revised suggestions claim mass similar in size to a car might be more realistic @entity274 travel is the focus of the 2014 movie interstellar			1
a scene from the @entity0 film , @entity168 , is pictured here			0
in the film lead character @entity280 , played by @entity10 , is tasked with joining a team for an interstellar mission aboard an @entity108 - inspired spacecraft to save humanity			2

a @entity13 scientist in @entity287 worked with an artist to create the concept
the interstellar spacecraft builds on previous designs that *thoeretically* allow distant travel by bending space - time
called @entity23 , it is similar to the @entity18 ship of the same name
dr @entity24 said the spacecraft could reach @entity148 in two weeks
@entity274 travel is the focus of @entity0 's 2014 movie @entity4
