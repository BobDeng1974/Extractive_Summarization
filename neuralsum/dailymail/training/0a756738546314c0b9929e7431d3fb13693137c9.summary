by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ behind the scenes at @entity4 , @entity2 ’s new team is rapidly coming together			1
time is short and his vision is critical			0
there will be a big shift in @entity11 football next season , with talk of @entity14 ’s formations at @entity4 dominating the storyline in the @entity16			1
it is an exciting new era for the game			0
during @entity22 ’s march to the @entity24 quarter - final , where they will play @entity25 , his mind has been whirring away with thoughts about his first season at @entity28			1
when he makes changes , as he did when he replaced golden boy @entity42 with @entity43 against @entity37 , he expects a positive impact			2
so far at this tournament it has worked			0
@entity14 has been studying @entity4 ’s personnel and he is tempted to make a radical switch to 3 - 4 - 3			1
if he does , it will be a bold move			0
the idea of a sweeper , a libero at the heart of the defence , has never sat easily with @entity11 football			0
@entity56 was the last man to play it with the national team , against @entity59 in a @entity61 qualifier in @entity62 and it was an unmitigated disaster			0
it has rarely been seen since			0
very few @entity11 teams , with the exception of @entity67 at @entity68 and @entity69 , have been able to work out a way of successfully playing the system			2
disaster : @entity73 reacts after @entity74 are beaten 2 - 0 by @entity59 in october 2006 visionary : @entity67 used a sweeper system while he was player - manager at @entity69 in the 1990s when @entity14 trials this formation later this month during @entity4 ’s pre-season tour to the @entity80 , the new coach intends to broaden the minds of his players			1
he wants them to become fascinated with tactics and the evolution of a game as it progresses in real time			0
as @entity90 notes in his brilliant autobiography , the @entity92 ‘ are obsessed with numbers on the pitch - “ he ’s a 10 , he ’s a seven , he ’s a six , he ’s a four ’			0
” it is new territory for @entity4 ’s players			2
they will have to adapt , to tune in to his obsession with the ability to make tactical adjustments in order to alter the outcome			0
this is football for thinkers			0
@entity14 has identified his potential back three and much depends on the potential recruitment of @entity107 from @entity108			1
on your bike : @entity111 star @entity107 is expected to be used as a sweeper if he signs from @entity108 with the departure of @entity114 and @entity115 after their long and successful @entity4 careers , @entity14 has a blank canvas at the back			1
@entity119 , a player sir @entity119 compared to the great @entity120 in his final season at @entity4 , is expected to settle into a designated position in the team			1
@entity124 , a spare part whenever @entity114 and @entity115 were n't fit enough to be paired together , may yet have a tailored role in @entity4 ’s defence			2
@entity14 expects his teams to be flexible and the demands on his players , in training and in matches , will feel fresh and new			0
in his spare time at the tournament he has been exploring his options with @entity4 , deviating from the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system that is an established practice in @entity11 and @entity138 football			1
@entity140 , outstanding for @entity141 last season and a member of @entity74 ’s @entity24 squad , has enormous potential on the left			1
licence to roam : @entity74 full back @entity140 will be expected to get forward under @entity14 video @entity140 signs for @entity4 although he is a naturalised left - back , he is young enough to develop his role in the same way as @entity151			1
if @entity14 plays 3 - 4 - 3 , @entity140 will have licence to roam down that left - hand side and he is young enough to do the dog work to get back in time to defend			1
tried and tested : @entity14 lifts the @entity156 trophy in 1995 there will be a whole new look about @entity4 next season and the players will be encouraged to gain a greater understanding about their roles on the pitch			2
these are the principles of the school of science at @entity167 , where @entity14 took their famous young team to @entity156 glory in 1995			0
he intends to transform @entity4 , with a new philosophy working its way into their @entity173 training centre before the start of the season			0
@entity14 wants a ball winner in the centre of the pitch , a strong - willed character who can feed @entity4 ’s forward line when they regain possession			1
@entity4 ’s coach is on the lookout for someone like @entity185 to provide that bite in the centre of the pitch alongside former @entity189 midfielder @entity188			2
it means @entity191 , who player who has always divided opinion , faces a fresh challenge to keep his place in the @entity4 team			1
the competition will do him some good			0
there is a big season ahead at @entity4 , particularly for a complex frontline that includes @entity42 , @entity73 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			2
given the proximity of @entity208 ’s relationship with his new manager , it seems inconceivable that the striker will be anything other than the main man up front			0
when @entity14 arrives for his first day at @entity4 , there will be no doubt who is in charge			2
main man : @entity208 will spearhead @entity4 's attack under his fellow countryman			1

@entity2 plans to employ 3 - 4 - 3 system at @entity4 that has worked so well for @entity22 at the @entity24
3 - 4 - 3 not used successfully in @entity74 since @entity67 in 1990s
@entity107 will be employed as libero if he signs from @entity108
@entity119 and @entity124 expected to play more under @entity14
new signing @entity140 will be given *freedom* to attack from left wing back
@entity191 will have to fight for his place as @entity14 looks for tough tackler to partner *£* 28.8m signing @entity188 in midfield
@entity42 will spearhead @entity4 's attack
