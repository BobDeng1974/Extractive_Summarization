a man who survived without a heart for a record two years has described how ‘ incredibly lucky ’ he feels after undergoing a successful transplant			2
@entity3 , 42 , was the first @entity4 to be discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart			1
it meant the pharmaceutical consultant had to carry around a rucksack containing a battery - powered pump attached by tubes to his chest everywhere he went			1
life - saving : @entity3 was the first person in the @entity16 to receive a total artificial heart implant and be able to go home thanks to a portable pump , right cutting - edge technology : @entity3 leaving @entity21 , @entity22 with son @entity23 and wife @entity24 , seen carrying his heart pump the pioneering operation was his only hope of surviving after he was hours from death through pressures on his fatally diseased organ			1
but now after almost two years , he has received a donor heart and is recovering in hospital			1
mr @entity3 , who lives with his wife @entity24 and seven - year - old son @entity23 in @entity35 , said he has been granted a ‘ third lease of life ’			2
speaking from @entity21 in @entity38 where he is expected to be discharged soon , he said : ‘ i feel incredibly lucky that i have been given a third lease of life as a result of my heart transplant			2
‘ it ’s hard to put into words the gratitude i feel to my donor and their family			1
they have helped me turn my life around again			0
pioneering : @entity3 's rucksack allowed him to leave the house for three - hour periods at a time innovative : @entity21 , @entity22 is the @entity16 's leading heart and lung transplant centre and fitted @entity3 's artificial heart in a £ 100,000 operation miraculous : the device @entity3 used is generally in service for around three years , during which it beat more than 200million times ‘ i want to thank all the amazing staff at @entity21 who have cared for me and i want to urge anyone who is thinking of registering on the @entity68 organ donor register to do it			1
’ mr @entity3 had been in a critical condition after the main chambers of his heart failed and no suitable donors could be found in july 2011			2
with his health deteriorating fast , specialist surgeons at @entity21 decided to fit him with the device in a £ 100,000 operation			0
some parts of the @entity79 have a 50 - year working life , although patients are generally expected to use it for up to two years - during which it will ‘ beat ’ more than 200million times			2
the rucksack contained a 14 - pound battery powered pump that allowed him to leave the house for three - hour periods at a time			1
it costs £ 20,000 - a - year to maintain			0
its @entity93 makers warn that using it more than two years because of the risk of blood clots building up			0
dr @entity96 implanted the first experimental device in @entity98 at @entity99 in @entity100 in 1969			0
the patient died three days @entity103 animal testing in the 1970s , the next operation took place in 1982 when the @entity107 7artificial heart was transplanted into a dentist called @entity109			0
198 operations @entity111 2001 the first completely self - contained total artificial heart was implanted in @entity114 at the @entity115 in @entity116 in 2008 , @entity110 was implanted with the @entity117 , becoming the the first patient to leave hospital with an artificial heart in may @entity121 then the @entity117 has been used in more than 900 implants in 65 hospitals			1
there had been trouble finding a heart donor large enough to power mr @entity3 ’s 6ft3in frame , but one was found last month - just before the two - year period ended			1
it means mr @entity3 has the record for the longest time living outside of hospital with a completely artificial heart			1
@entity133 , clinical director of transplant services at @entity21 , said : ‘ i am delighted that we were able to find a suitable donor heart for @entity3 to have a heart transplant and i expect him to go home very soon			1
’ before the initial operation to fit an artificial heart , mr @entity3 spoke of how the external pump would transform his life			1
he was diagnosed with @entity145 , a disease of the heart muscle that can cause arrhythmia , heart failure , and sudden death			0
the exact cause of the condition - the second most common reason for sudden death in the young - is unknown , although it appears to be passed on genetically			0
he said in 2011 : ‘ it feels very different - before the operation my heartbeat was very weak and i could hardly feel my pulse			2
now it ’s a very strong heartbeat			0
‘ two years ago i was cycling nine miles to work and nine miles back every day but by the time i was admitted to hospital i was struggling to walk even a few yards			0
' i am really excited about going home and just being able to do the everyday things that i have n’t been able to do for such a long time - such as playing in the garden with my son and cooking a meal for my family			0
’ there are 214 people waiting for donor hearts in @entity16 , 15 of whom are children			0
many more are not even put on the transplant list because their chances of surviving are so slim .			0

@entity3 had a completely artificial heart powered by a pump that he had to carry around to keep it beating
after two years with his battery - powered heart he has finally had a donor heart successfully fitted
he said : ' it ’s hard to put into words the gratitude i feel to my donor '
