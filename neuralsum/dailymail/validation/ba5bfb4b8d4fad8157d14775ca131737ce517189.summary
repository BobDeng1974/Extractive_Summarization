a visionary project has been approved which will see @entity2 ’s largest solar farm constructed in @entity3 in a staggering $ 1 billion project			1
the impressive development promises to be 100 times bigger than the country ’s current largest solar farm and potentially , the largest of its kind in the world			1
the plant will be located on a 5,000 hectare acre site at @entity13 on @entity3 ’s @entity14 and promises to produce enough clean power for 550,000 homes			1
the south - west @entity3 project is expected to begin construction in 2016			2
it is hoped that within eight years the solar farm will be generating two gigawatts of power ; a massive figure which is more power than any coal station in @entity3 is currently capable of producing			1
@entity24 is 20 mw solar farm constructed on brownfield land in @entity27			1
the solar farm development , set to be built in @entity3 , will be 100 times bigger after seven years as a barrister , @entity29 established @entity31 , a solar project broker and consumer comparison service , which was the driving force behind the proposal ‘ this will be a wonderful example of what @entity2 can make from our natural resources , space and sunshine , ’ @entity29 , managing director of @entity31 , told @entity36			1
' @entity2 is wonderfully geared to some visionary projects to harness those benefits of cheaper , bountiful , reliable sources of power , ” mr @entity29 told the @entity48			1
mr @entity29 was formerly one of @entity2 ’s top defamation lawyers and won some of the country 's most high - profile cases			1
in 2006 he won a case which saw @entity55 player @entity54 awarded $ 385,000 , which is the largest ever damages figure handed down by a judge , after a today tonight program accused @entity54 of domestic violence			2
@entity29 also represented political figures , including defence intelligence chief @entity61			2
after seven years in his profession @entity29 established @entity31 , a solar project broker and consumer comparison service , which was the driving force behind the proposal			1
with @entity29 at the helm , @entity31 campaigned for 18 ‘ exhaustive ’ months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago			1
the @entity69 referred to the @entity70 before the game - changing project was given the go - ahead			0
the @entity73 will be built toward full @entity75 capacity in ‘ manageable steps ’ over a number of years			2
with @entity29 at the helm , @entity31 campaigned for 18 ‘ exhaustive ’ months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago ‘ we have optionality reserved to build over time , up to eight years			1
this means we are able to break it down into manageable steps , ’ mr @entity29 told @entity36			2
solar choice have located one of a very few locations which meet all requirements			1
‘ it ’s wonderfully positioned , close to major transmission nodes in the national electricity grid			0
it ’s on large - scale , cleared flat country			0
all aspects make it for an aspiring study , ’ mr @entity29 told @entity36			2
the area is also ‘ soaked in sunshine ’ due to ‘ good sun hours ’ and has no neighbours			0
there are no ecological restraints			0
crucially , the @entity13 site is close to a 330 kilovolt substation near @entity103 , operated by @entity104			0
this ensures the solar power will be able to reach @entity2 across the nation			1
the next step will be for @entity31 to work with @entity104 for six to nine months to determine how to connect the solar farm to the grid			1
the project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors			0
‘ investors are well - advanced in the project			0
a number of @entity118 and @entity119 - based parties are certainly very excited by the solar farm			1
the interested parties already have experience with similar , very large - scale solar projects			0
‘ no one has finally signed up but they have completed due diligence on the project			0
’ the project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors			0
however , investors require legislative certainty from the government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board however , investors require legislative certainty from the federal government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board			1
the @entity138 government wants to redefine a renewable energy target ( @entity140 ) set by a previous centre - left government in 2009			2
the government promised that 20 percent of projected energy use would be renewable by 2020			0
however , the current government wants to aim for 20 percent of actual energy use , which is far less			0
to reach the target , the government subsidises companies which invest in renewable energy as well as households and small businesses which opt to use such energy			0
changing the current mandate could potentially deter investors			0
but the cost of renewable energy is higher than the subsidies , so companies pass on costs to customers			0
the government and opposition are now negotiating new terms of the @entity140 in a review that is expected to last a year			2
‘ we have placed this project on the radar at all levels of politics , ’ @entity29 told @entity36			2
‘ we are helping to show them that there are alternatives			0
there is conjecture at a federal level that there is not enough of a pipe line in @entity2			2
‘ however this project would be considerable way to help achieve the target ( 20 per cent of projected energy use )			0
‘ it is proof that there is enough of a pipeline in @entity2 to reach the target , not to fall short of it			0
’ the solar farm is forecast to take @entity2 25 per cent closer to achieving the current target , 41,000 gwh			1
the solar farm is forecast to take @entity2 25 per cent closer to achieving the 41,000 gwh target by 2020			1

@entity2 's largest solar farm will be constructed in @entity3
the $ *1billion* development has taken 18 months to be approved
' @entity73 ' will be built on a 5,000 hectare site and will produce enough clean power for 550,000 homes
one of @entity2 's top barristers @entity29 is behind the project
solar choice have many interested major investors but are waiting on the federal government to finalise plans for the @entity140
