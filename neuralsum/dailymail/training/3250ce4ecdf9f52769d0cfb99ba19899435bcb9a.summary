a ' treatment tax ' should be imposed on alcohol bought in shops to turn round soaring levels of drink - related hospital admissions , a think tank close to @entity1 has said			1
the @entity7 said wine , beer and spirits bought in off - licenses and supermarkets should be subject to a levy of a penny per unit to fund rehabilitation for alcoholics			1
it would mean that a the price of bottle of wine , which contains around 10 units , would rise by 10p			1
a pack of four beers would rise by a similar amount - with pints of low - strength beer going up by 2p			1
the @entity7 said wine , beer and spirits bought in off - licenses and supermarkets should be subject to a levy of a penny per unit to fund rehabilitation for alcoholics the think tank , which was set up by the @entity34 before the election , said action was needed because the number of alcohol - related hospital admissions have risen to more than 1.2million a year			1
new figures reveal that admissions in @entity41 rose by more than 5 per cent over the space of two years			0
but critics will question why ordinary responsible drinkers should be hit in their pockets to fund treatment for the irresponsible			0
@entity47 , the director of the @entity7 , said : ' alcohol abuse can rip into families , make communities less safe and entrench poverty			1
' this is a growing problem but for years effective treatment has been the preserve of the wealthy			0
it 's time to break this injustice wide open and fund a new generation of rehabilitation treatment			1
' the @entity7 said the figures show alcohol abuse is an increasing burden on society and public services – and called for a new ' treatment tax ' to be levied on off - licence sales to fund rehab			1
the think tank - which is close to @entity1 - said there had been a surge in alcohol - related hospital admissions data shows the number of admissions rose from 1,168,266 in 2010/11 to 1,232,464 in 2012/13 , the latest statistics from the @entity75 highlight			1
analysis from the @entity7 has found that , going on recent trends , the number of cases could reach as much as 1.5 million by the time of the election			2
public spending cuts since the election mean that residential treatment – the most effective form of ' rehab ' treatment – has suffered from reductions in spending			0
the think tank said these cuts should be reversed , and said the ' treatment tax ' would be an effective way to afford this			0
the levy would be added to off - licence alcohol sales to fund rehab for people with alcohol and drug addictions			2
under the scheme , a tax of a penny per unit would be added by the end of the next @entity106 to fund recovery services to the tune of £ 1.1billion over five years			2
the @entity7 was also critical of a lack of prosecutions of individuals serving alcohol to people who are drunk			2
there were only 29 convictions in @entity41 over the five years from 2009 to 2013			0
in the last recorded year there were five			0
the think tank called for @entity118 to put more resources into cracking down on those who sell alcohol to drunks			2
around 1.6million people are estimated to be dependent on alcohol in @entity41 and one in five children live with a parent who drinks hazardously			0
every year alcohol is said to cost society £ 21billion			0
the @entity7 said that as much as 70 per cent of accident and emergency visits in the early hours are alcohol related , and 40 per cent of @entity132 attendances at weekends are caused by alcohol .			0
