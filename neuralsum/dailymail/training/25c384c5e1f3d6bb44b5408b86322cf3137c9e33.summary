@entity1 boss @entity0 has admitted that @entity4 target @entity2 could leave the club before friday 's transfer window deadline			1
the midfielder reacted angrily after being substituted during his side 's dramatic 2 - 1 comeback win against @entity10 on wednesday , fuelling speculation that he will head for the @entity13 exit			0
@entity4 boss @entity14 , who was pictured speaking to executive vice chairman - and chief transfer negotiator - @entity16 during training on thursday , is prepared to offer £ 25million for the @entity19 star , as revealed by @entity20 on tuesday			1
' here today , gone tomorrow			0
' @entity2 threw his gloves to the ground on his walk to the dugout after being replaced by @entity40 in the 60th minute against @entity10			0
@entity40 grabbed @entity1 's equaliser 16 minutes after coming on , before @entity42 executed a perfect scissor kick to secure three points in added time			0

honest : @entity1 boss @entity0 has admitted that @entity2 could leave the @entity60 champions @entity2 deal : @entity4 are keen to sign £ 25million - rated @entity1 midfielder @entity2 it was thought he was looking for a pay rise that might cause unrest in the @entity1 dressing room after chief executive @entity66 admitted talks were deadlocked and ruefully added that it was ‘ always about money in these negotiations			1
’ but @entity20 understands the figure presented to @entity73 bosses is around £ 150,000 a week , half the weekly £ 300,000 dangled before @entity74 to extend his @entity31 stay			2
@entity2 evidently believes he is well worth a salary that would edge him nearer top earners like @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 and is prepared to stick to his guns			0
though talks have ground to a halt , @entity1 are reluctant to sell and will ask for at least £ 25million , should they sense there is a danger of @entity2 running down his current deal			1
on the ball : @entity4 boss @entity14 watched @entity2 - who wants parity with @entity1 's top earners , including @entity80 ( right ) - in action for the @entity60 giants last week against @entity47 with @entity4 ’s midfield still in need of strengthening , even after the arrival of @entity97 , @entity14 is unlikely to be deterred and will surely be encouraged by a clear signal he would have little difficulty keeping @entity2 happy on the pay front			1

sports total , for whom @entity106 works , have since tried to play down claims that @entity2 could be heading for @entity31 , but @entity14 has promised more significant signings before the window closes and has the 24 - year old in his sights			2
changing times : @entity14 said the signing of @entity97 would be one of the first of many big deals at @entity31			0
