@entity1 manager @entity0 insists that reports @entity3 is set to leave the club this summer are ' completely made up '			1
the @entity6 international joined the @entity7 from @entity8 in january for a fee in the region of Â£ 12million , signing a four - and - a - half year contract			1
the 23 - year - old made a fine start to his @entity1 career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two @entity17 matches			1
@entity3 joined @entity1 from @entity8 in the january transfer window and it has been suggested that @entity1 are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season , but @entity0 has rubbished the speculation insisting @entity3 can have a big future in @entity7			1
' this @entity3 thing is completely made up , ' he told reporters			2
' we bought @entity3 last january because we think that he can have a big future at @entity1			2
then during the season , there might be a moment when a player 's form drops , and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in			2
so that 's the only situation going on right now			0
' @entity3 has our full confidence			0
then he has also changed his team , so it 's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage			0
@entity3 has been dropped to the bench by @entity0 in recent matches ' it 's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single - handedly wins games by himself			1
' he will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason			0
so one only plays when he deserves to play			0
' we bought @entity3 because we believe in his qualities , ' @entity0 added			2
the @entity1 boss insists @entity3 will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary ' then if @entity8 [ @entity65 ] decided to sell him , it 's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that @entity3 is a young player and that he needs to play			1
' @entity1 could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this			0
i am sure that @entity3 next season will achieve great things			0
