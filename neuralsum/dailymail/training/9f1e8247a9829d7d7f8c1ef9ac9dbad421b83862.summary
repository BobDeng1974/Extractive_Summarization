a @entity115 spokesman said the project had been driven by a personal interest from the @entity118			2
they said : ' @entity120 came about as a result of @entity0 of @entity1 's desire to help children of addicted families break the cycle of addiction , and she has taken a close interest in its progress			1
better than normal lessons ? the excited children wave their flags at @entity6 entertaining : @entity6 was amused when one of the children told her their favourite part of the school day is lunchtime good impression : the children said they liked @entity6 's dress pink royal duties : @entity141 was driven to the school in @entity20 this morning			1
she immediately sprang into action to meet and greet people @entity0 is given a warm welcome from a man in uniform ' through her patronage of @entity75 , @entity0 of @entity1 became aware of the shattering impact of addiction , not only on those addicted , but also on their families			1
research suggests that children of addicts are seven times more likely to become addicts themselves			0
' @entity0 directed her charity , @entity65 of @entity66 and @entity6 and prince @entity67 to find a way to help			1
the @entity65 and @entity72 commissioned research , which resulted in bringing together two charities together , @entity165 and @entity75 , to deliver @entity22 and get specialist support to children at a young age , before problems have the potential to develop			1
' today 's engagement is an opportunity for @entity0 of @entity1 to meet those delivering the programmes and discuss how the pilot is progressing			1
' @entity0 met project co-ordinators and headteachers who are helping to roll out the scheme in @entity179 , @entity62 , @entity180 and @entity20			1
she then joined a private counselling session during the hour - and - a - half - long visit			2
the pupils waited patiently for their chance to speak to the royal honest answers : @entity6 asked the children what they liked best about school and the responses included books and lunchtime getting up to date : the royal said she was pleased with how a charity project at the school supporting families dealing with addiction was progressing @entity6 joined @entity60 to meet members of the school and hear speeches			1
the comedian had the @entity0 in stitches when , during a speech to mark the occasion , he urged the assembled media not to focus on the ' style icon in their midst ' - they were wearing , where their clothes were from or what hairstyle was in place - but to focus on the project			1
' basically , do n't make the story about me , ' he joked			0
@entity6 burst into giggles and could n't stop smiling throughout the rest of the comedy star 's speech			1
after he sat down she leant over to him and whispered something , giggling again			0
on a serious note , @entity60 said @entity6 is ' genuinely committed ' to the issue , and hailed the involvement of the @entity65			1
' what 's good about it is that it will hopefully de-stigmatise the whole area			0
addiction does n't care what social class you 're from			0
it 's across the board			0
the levels of addiction in @entity236 will be as high , if not higher , than some of the most deprived areas in the country , ' he said			0
' i think , from the brief conversations i 've had with her , she 's committed to it as a person and probably even more so now as a mother , because you realise children are such fragile things and you 've got to try and support them when they 're at their weakest			0
' @entity0 of @entity1 is well known for her polished look and perfectly quaffed hair , but she stepped away from her traditional blow dry for her visit to @entity18 in @entity254			1
in a half - up style , @entity6 rang the changes with tightly wound glossy curls draped over either shoulder of her pink goat dress			1
this is opposed to the @entity118 ' usual style of loosely waved blow - dry			0
as always her brunette locks had a high shine finish and there was not a hair out of place despite her busy day			0
hairdresser to the stars , @entity267 says : ' this look is great for day old hair			0
the curls will stay in place much better with hair that has not been washed for a day			0
perfect for a long day of meeting the public			0
' he continued : ' @entity6 has probably been quite busy so her front lengths have grown giving the perfect base for this look			1
' this style will also keep the hair off her face during the summer and gives an added something to the plainness of her dress			0
' with her busy schedule , this look is perfect if your hair has grown a little too heavy at the front to wear loose as it will elongate the face			0
this look perks the face up and highlights @entity6 's cheekbones			2
' it 's regal , neat and well balanced and gives the 60 's vibe of the dress a modern update			0
' @entity298 of @entity300 salon in @entity301 added : ' @entity6 has gone for much larger curls on this occasion which can be achieved on smooth hair using a large barrel tong			2
' this makes a nice change for @entity6 and the good thing about this style is that the curls will drop out as the day goes on , giving a less structured more relaxed look which we usually see on @entity6			2
' it 's a great style to last all day in hot weather as the curls become more dishevelled as the day goes on			0
the key to this look is to start the curls a few inches from the root area to give a modern yet still classic look			0
' celeb backing : @entity60 joined the @entity6 on a visit to an @entity325 programme at @entity18 in @entity20 @entity6 giggled as she sat on the stage to hear @entity60 's speech - which also had a serious message about the project at the school @entity0 took an update on the project seriously and was interested to hear the progress that had been made work of art : @entity6 was presented with a @entity335 style portrait of herself holding @entity63			1
the framed picture was given to thank her for visiting set to hang in @entity115 ? @entity0 seemed delighted with the gift the royal carried the portrait back to the car herself as she returned home a spokesman for @entity165 said : ' with one in three children in every classroom affected by a mental health problem , early intervention is vital			2
@entity0 of @entity1 became @entity165 's royal patron last year after expressing particular interest in helping to support children and families affected by mental health problems			1
' at @entity165 we work with more than 80,000 children in schools across the country to provide integrated mental health support to those affected by domestic violence , abuse addiction , divorce , school transition , bullying and other complex social issues			0
' inside the school , the @entity118 sat in on a steering group comprised of head teachers and charity workers involved in rolling out the @entity22 scheme			2
@entity6 , who had her hair half swept from her face , listened intently as she was updated about its success so far and was clearly interested as she asked several pertinent questions about its workings			2
' were the parents quite surprised by the things their children were saying ? ' she asked			0
nodding intently , she continued : ' have you found it difficult to attract parents given the stigma that can be associated with these issues ? ' she also remarked that the training being given to teachers to spot children who may have issues due to their parents ' substance abuse ' gives them more confidence to approach the topics			0
' ' that 's fantastic , ' she said , as she learnt about some of the success stories so far			0
as she left , the royal was presented with a work of art from a pupil			0
the painting was a @entity335 style portrait of the @entity0 cradling baby @entity63			2
she appeared delighted with the gift and carried it herself back to the awaiting car .			0
