@entity0 and buildings are usually an undesirable combination			0
but one architect is set to transform a @entity5 landmark by building a giant tower made of fungus			0
it will be built from blocks composed of corn and fungus which will grow and mesh together			0
it was designed by @entity5 architect @entity17 the bricks will be composed of corn husks and mycelium - the vegetative part of fungus			1
they will be grown in block - shaped moulds where roots will knit together to keep their shape			0
once used in the eco-friendly building , the ' self - assembling ' fungus bricks will carry on growing and bond together to strengthen the overall structure			0
the building will incorporate reflective bricks to throw light downwards onto the organic blocks so that they can carry on growing			2
the @entity35 will host the eco-friendly organic structure , which has been designed to generate no waste and provide shade and seating for visitors to the gallery ’s summer music concerts			1
called @entity13 , the building was designed by architect @entity17 and will open this june			1
the self - assembling ' bricks will be made of a combination of corn husks and mycelium , which is the vegetative part of fungus			2
the tower will be grown and return to the earth with hardly any environmental impact			0
the shape of structure will be three open towers joined together and will include a bricks that will be coated with reflective film to bounce sunlight onto fungal root bricks below , to encourage them to grow the two organic materials will be placed in block - shaped moulds where they will grow and once assembled , will continue to grow and mesh together , to strengthen the tower			2
the shape of structure will be three open towers joined together and will include a bricks that will be coated with reflective film to bounce sunlight onto the fungal root bricks below , to encourage them to grow , @entity65 reported			0
the structure ’s strange shape is designed to push hot air upwards and draw colder air down to where people can sit and cool down , according to @entity77			2
the @entity35 ( pictured ) will host the eco-friendly organic structure , which has been designed to generate no waste and provide shade , seating and water for visitors to the gallery 's summer music concerts @entity86 , a curator in @entity88 ’s @entity87 , said : ‘ this material could really change the way people build			1
‘ it reinvents the most basic component of architecture - the brick - as both a material of the future and a classic trigger for open - ended design possibilities			0
’ mr @entity17 , whose architecture firm , @entity101 , is based in @entity5 , won the chance to build his organic structure at the gallery in the 15th @entity106 competition , which demanded that designers create structures that do not create waste once their period of display is over			1

pictured is a view of what the structure should look like from the cool oasis inside his @entity13 design is almost carbon neutral in its construction and the reflective bricks will be returned to the company that makes the coating , while the other completely organic bricks will be composted			1
mr @entity17 told the @entity134 : ‘ we love the idea of testing new ideas by putting them out into the world so this is a huge opportunity for us			0

@entity5 's @entity35 will host the organic structure
bricks will be grown from a combination of corn husks and mycelium and used to build the structure , which is designed to draw cool air downwards
architect @entity17 's @entity13 design will be almost carbon neutral in its construction and even reflective bricks used in the structure will be *recycled*
