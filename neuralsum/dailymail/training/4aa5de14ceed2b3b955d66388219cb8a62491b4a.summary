by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 27 august 2013 a family had a lucky escape when their 4x4 plunged 20ft down an embankment after careering past traffic lights and through a safety barrier			1
the @entity8 was being driven through @entity9 by a 37 - year - old woman carrying two children on board , who apparently lost control of the vehicle and drove down the steep slope into a row of back gardens			1
the car destroyed the safety barrier and uprooted a tree before finally coming to rest on top of a basket of children 's toys during the accident last week			1
it is unclear how the driver , who has not been identified , lost control of her car			1
@entity43 described their horror at witnessing the accident , which was ' like an earthquake ' - and said they were shocked that more people were not injured			0
@entity50 had left the garden outside her home with her son @entity53 just minutes before the crash			1
recovery : workers had to lift the car out of the garden with a crane after it tumbled down an embankment escape : the 37 - year - old woman who was driving the car with her two children in was unharmed written off : the front of the car was utterly mangled after its 20ft fall last monday afternoon ' i was upstairs when i heard a noise and i just looked out of window and saw the car coming into the garden , ' the 23 - year - old said			2
' i 'm shocked , but relieved that no one was in the garden at the time			2
luckily , i was not feeling very well so i had gone upstairs with @entity53 to watch a dvd			0
' i definitely think there needs to be a better barrier between the road and our gardens			2
' scene : the communal garden where the car fell was littered with debris following the accident relief : @entity87 and @entity88 with their one - year - old daughter @entity91 , whose toys the car landed on her next - door neighbour @entity94 , who also has access to the communal garden , said : ' i was in the kitchen and it felt as if the whole house was shaking , almost like an earthquake			1
' i was n't sure what was going on			0
i heard children crying and went out and saw a car had ended up in our gardens			0
' his wife @entity106 , who was out at the time with their one - year - old daughter @entity91 , added : ' it was the tree that stopped the car from hitting the house			0
' this could have been a tragedy on another level			0
i think there needs to be a secure barrier on the road made out of concrete			0

@entity120 lost control of @entity8 and rammed through safety barrier
finally came to rest in families ' communal back garden in @entity9
neighbours tell of their terror and relief that no one was hurt
