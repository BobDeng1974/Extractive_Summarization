by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 10:43 est , 28 november 2013 a @entity2 woman is being forced to bring up her daughter alone after her medic husband was denied permission to join her in the @entity2			1
@entity6 met @entity7 in his native @entity8 - the couple have been married for two years and had their first child , @entity10 , 21 months ago			1
but despite his medical training , he has been banned from moving to @entity2 because the @entity13 says the family does not earn enough to support itself			2
family : but @entity6 and @entity7 are currently forced to live separately after he was denied permission to move to @entity2 to be with his wife and daughter @entity10 wedding day : the couple were married in 2011 after meeting in mr @entity7 's native country of @entity8 ms @entity6 - the daughter of two conservative councillors - says that both she and her husband have been offered jobs at the family firm and rent - free accommodation with her parents in @entity29			1
' i am a @entity2 citizen , we are happily married and both very skilled - i never thought for a moment i would not be allowed to come back to live in my own country with my husband , ' the 29 - year - old said			1
' the ridiculous thing about not allowing @entity37 to come here , where he could earn good wages , is that i am now a single mother			0
were it not for my parents i would probably have to go on benefits			0
' we would not be a burden and there is plenty of room here - even with me , my parents and my sister we are rattling around here			0
' the @entity51 idea is supposed to be to lessen the burden on taxpayers but it increases it - i can not understand how these rules are helping anyone			0
' alone : ms @entity6 is now living with @entity10 at her parents ' home in @entity29 while fighting the @entity13 father and daughter : a screengrab of a @entity63 conversation between mr @entity7 and @entity10 ms @entity6 met mr @entity7 , 33 , in 2006 - ironically , when she was struggling to secure an @entity8 visa allowing her to work as an @entity66 teacher			1
the pair wed in 2011 and lived in @entity68 and @entity69 , but when @entity10 was born they decided to settle near ms @entity6 's family in @entity72			1
they were confident that mr @entity7 's background as an on - call doctor would enable him to secure a well - paid job , while ms @entity6 was receiving maternity pay from her previous job at an investment bank			1
she was being paid £ 13,000 - but even though she had substantial savings , the application was refused because she did not meet the £ 18,600 threshold required by the @entity13 in order to ensure that prospective immigrants can support themselves			0
a large proportion of @entity2 families would fail to meet the income requirement , which is much higher than the minimum wage			2
together : mr @entity7 is not even allowed to visit the @entity2 in case he stays in the country illegally it was imposed by home secretary @entity93 in 2012 as part of @entity51 attempts to reduce net immigration below 100,000 a year by the time of the next election			2
however , despite the crackdown which has left families such as ms @entity6 's separated , citizens of @entity102 and @entity103 will be allowed to come to @entity2 without any restrictions from january			1
in addition , the government has struggled to deport a number of criminals and anti-british activists such as @entity110 and @entity111 , who both put up legal fights for years before finally being forced to leave the @entity2			0
ms @entity6 lodged an appeal against the decision in april , and was told this month that she would have to go to court to contest the visa refusal			1
mr @entity7 is not even allowed to apply for a tourist visa to visit his wife and daughter for a short period , because officials say he might attempt to stay in @entity2 illegally			2
heartbreak : ms @entity6 insists the family is able to support itself thanks to her husband 's medical training playing : ms @entity6 is now working at her family firm , a traditional tannery based in @entity72 ' @entity128 and @entity10 went over for a holiday in july , but it was a nightmare - i spent 24 hours travelling with a crying baby , ' she said			1
ms @entity6 has now set up a support group for other families in the same situation as her , and has met with the @entity136 in a bid to further her cause			2
she is working as a project manager for the family business , a leather tannery named @entity142 which has been owned by her relatives for 150 years and still uses traditional oak bark techniques			0
her father @entity145 is chairman of the local parish council , while her mother @entity147 sits as a conservative on @entity29 district council			0
a spokesman for the @entity13 said : ' mr @entity7 ’s application was refused because it did not meet the necessary financial requirements			0
as there is an appeal outstanding in this case it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage			0

@entity6 married @entity160 in @entity8
the couple have a daughter , @entity10 , and decided to settle in @entity2
but officials said they do not earn enough for him to immigrate even though he is trained as a doctor and they can live rent - free
