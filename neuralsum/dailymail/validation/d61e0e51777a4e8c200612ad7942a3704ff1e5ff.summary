patients at a hospital @entity2 department are being forced to parade details of their conditions on laminated signs			1
they are assessed by staff when they arrive , then given a red card if their illness is serious or a green one for less urgent issues , with a two or three - word summary of their ailment			1
these are designed to speed up staff assessments as patients wait for treatment , but the trial scheme has been described as ‘ insensitive ’ and like ‘ a police line - up ’			1
@entity21 , 49 , has criticised a hospital after she was forced to wear a sign detailing her condition while waiting for treatment it means those with alcohol , mental health and gynaecological problems , and others who might prefer to keep their conditions private , could be at risk of losing patient confidentiality			0
@entity21 , 49 , said she was appalled when she went to @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , and was given a green card detailing her ankle injury after she was assessed by a nurse			1
‘ i did n’t mind much for me as i had hurt my ankle , ’ she added			2
‘ but i thought it was disgusting that patients with alcohol problems or mental health issues had to carry cards that showed everyone what was wrong with them			2
’ the mother of five from @entity35 has complained to hospital bosses about the scheme			1
she said for those ‘ carrying signs saying they had alcohol problems , it just smacked of them being marked out – it was like a police line - up ’			1
mrs @entity21 added : ‘ the poor man in front of me was looking after his teenage daughter , who had alcohol poisoning , and everyone could see what was wrong with her			0
‘ i could see why every single person in the queue was there – and we had to wait in a line that went past lots of people sitting down waiting , so they could all see what was wrong with us too			2
it ’s really poor for patient confidentiality			0
’ hospital bosses at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , said it was designed to speed up staff assessments she suggested it would be possible to obscure the details written on the cards , leaving the colour visible for staff , but said patients coming into @entity2 might be too distressed or distracted to think of doing this			1
‘ the people who come in are panicking or in pain , ’ she added			2
‘ they could see anyone they know as it ’s a local hospital , and they have to carry these cards showing what ’s wrong with them			0
’ another woman who visited the hospital said : ‘ i had a laminated card and actually laughed at the insensitivity			1
i had a very negative experience , having just moved here from another county , and as a nurse myself was quite disheartened with the overall care i received at a sensitive time to myself and my family			0
’ the trust responsible for the hospital has defended the scheme , saying it will lead to quicker assessment times			2
the trial scheme has been described as ‘ insensitive ’ and like ‘ a police line - up ’ ( picture posed by models ) dr @entity110 , medical director of the @entity111 , said : ‘ we ’d ask people to bear in mind that the new reception arrangements at @entity34 are part of a pilot scheme that is being developed and constantly refined			1
‘ we want to provide patients arriving at @entity2 with a rapid assessment so they can be seen by the right clinical service at the right time			0
at the moment , people arriving at @entity34 will be assessed by a nurse and either referred on for emergency medical help or redirected to see their own gp			0
‘ the new area that has been set up within the hospital entrance mirrors the main reception and pays the same regard to patient confidentiality			0
‘ the information patients are being asked to provide on arrival is the same as when they book into the @entity2 reception , with the difference that they are rapidly assessed and directed to the right service for them			0
‘ we are not aware of any complaints about the pilot scheme			0

patients at @entity34 are given a card with summary of ailment
the card is red if their illness is serious or green for less urgent issues
hospital bosses said it was designed to speed up staff assessments
but trial scheme was described as ‘ insensitive ’ and like ‘ a police line - up '
