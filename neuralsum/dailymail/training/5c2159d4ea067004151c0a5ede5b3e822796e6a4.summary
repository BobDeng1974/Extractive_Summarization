by @entity0 @entity2 underground train passenger @entity1 who discovered his vending machine chocolate bar had been nibbled in the corner did not have far to look for the culprit â€“ a mouse that had infiltrated the equipment			1
he could see the critter inside the machine where it was continuing to tuck into the free feast			0
@entity1 said : ' i think the sound of me ordering a snack as it dropped into the bin scared the mouse off temporarily , but when i realised my chocolate bar had been nibbled and looked at the other items			1
but then i realised that the mouse was still there , and seconds later it moved back to the front of the vending machine and continue tucking into a pack of chocolate biscuits			1
' he said the incident on the @entity39 station of the blue line on the @entity24 metro network had left him feeling ill , saying : ' it was really disgusting , and i posted the video online to complain about it and warn other people			1

' mouse about that : the incident happened on the @entity39 station of the blue line on the @entity24 metro the @entity50 of @entity24 which owns and operates the underground line in the eastern @entity2 city confirmed that they have started an investigation after being made aware of the video			2
they said they had contacted the company that owned the vending machine to demand an explanation			2
a spokesman said : ' we understand fully the concerns of our passengers , many of whom have contacted us about this unusual event , and it is being fully investigated and steps will be taken as a result of what we find out			0
' a spokesman for the company that owned and operated the vending machine , @entity72 , said : ' how the mouse got inside is a complete mystery but we can confirm that the machine has been taken out of service and in the meantime has been completely cleaned , disinfected and sanitised and will be checked by mechanics to make sure this ca n't happen again before its put back into service			2
' the mystery , however , is how it happened in the first place , because we have been offering vending machine services for 16 years in @entity2 and despite the fact that we have 4000 machines in operation across the country , we have never had a similar case			0
all machines are not only vandalism proof , they are also secure to prevent pests from getting inside			0
