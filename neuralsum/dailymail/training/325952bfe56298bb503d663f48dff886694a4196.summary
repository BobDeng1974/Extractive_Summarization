she fell from the line into the @entity14 , where the wound became infected with necrotizing fasciitis which threatened to kill her			0
doctors were forced to amputate her left leg , right foot and both hands to keep her alive			1
new hands : @entity8 , 24 , revealed her $ 200,000 bionic hands for the first time today @entity26 : the hands allow @entity8 to carry out everyday tasks like signing her name and chopping vegetables everyday activities : the 24 - year - old said she was glad to be back to doing normal things like cooking and cleaning but today was a happy one for the @entity36 student , she showed off a major milestone in her recovery - her prosthetic hands			1
appearing on the today show she revealed what she is now able to do from signing her name to chopping vegetables and shaking hands			1
the hands are already proving so effective that she feels she can do ' pretty much whatever she wants to '			2
she first tried the @entity46 hands at the beginning of the week at the company 's clinic and already she 's able to lift and grip with both hands			2
she filmed herself picking and eating a potato chip out of a bag which she said was the most satisfying activity so far			2
her prosthetist @entity55 , who is co-director and prosthetics coordinator at @entity57 , is the expert behind the limbs			0
explaining them on the show , he said that they work off the electrical and chemical reaction created every time we flex or contract a muscle			0
' that electrical signal is very , very slight , ' he said			0
' but our electrodes are sensitive enough to pick it up through the skin			0
' ' she ’s very smart and very adept , ' @entity55 said of @entity8			1
' i would n’t be surprised if in the next month or two she ’ll be able to use them without thinking about it			0
' ' there are things that she 's done in two days , three days that it takes other people 6 months or a year to gain control over these devices			2
' for @entity8 her ambitions are simply to restore a bit of normality			1
cooking and cleaning : @entity8 said everyday activities were the things she had missed most			1
she could n't wait to use the hands on returning home hope : @entity8 , the graduate student who had to have four limbs amputated after contracting a flesh - eating bacteria , has been given $ 200,000 prosthetic hands independent : the limbs have given @entity8 her independence back visit @entity97 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy ' i 'm really looking forward to cooking with these and to cleaning my house , ' she said			1
" i ’m sort of @entity104 , so it seems like a weird thing to want to do , but i really want to clean			0
' ' sometimes i wake up and i ’m just like , ‘ @entity110 , is this my life ? this is crazy ! ' ' i look at pictures of how i was before , and i feel almost disconnected from that person because my perspective now is so different than the point of view of that girl			0
' ' and so , in a way , it almost feels like i died a year ago and i was reborn as someone different			2
' discussing using the hands for the first time , she said she was hopeful it would develop naturally			2
' it 's almost like a muscle memory with these things			0
' you know , it 's like you got to find the sweet spot and be able to pick things up naturally			0
and that 'll come with time			0
' she is currently finishing her master ’s degree in psychology and then plans to start a program in social work			0
the hands would normally cost $ 100,000 each but the company who produces them have hired @entity8 as a spokeswoman so are providing them free of charge			1
support : @entity145 @entity55 is impressed by how well @entity8 has adapted to having the hands electrical impulse : the hands react to the chemical and electrical signals made when muscles are moved she is also due to have a prosthetic leg fitted later this year			1
the wound on @entity8 's leg initially received 22 stitches and ran up to her thigh			1
however , she quickly suffered problems returning to the emergency room as it was clear the wound would n't heal and her leg turned a dark purple color			2
as soon as doctors realized what the infection was they amputated her leg			2
' i was n’t able to walk , ' she told show host @entity167			0
' i was n’t able to speak			0
the only thing i was able to babble was , ‘ i think i ’m dying '			0
’ it was then her hands and foot turned back and doctors had to amputate them too			1
speaking on her recovery earlier this month , @entity8 said she wanted to spread a message of hope			1
' i 'm doing great , and regardless of what happens to you , regardless of the circumstances in your life - there 's always so much joy out there and you 've just got ta find it , ' she said			0
courage : @entity8 is pictured here when she left hospital almost a year after she had four limbs amputated goodbye : @entity8 poses with hospital staff as she goes to a rehabilitation clinic			1
