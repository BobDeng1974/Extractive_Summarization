dr @entity0 is claiming substantial damages in a whistleblowing claim against the @entity3 a highly - experienced doctor was sacked by text while on a family holiday after blowing the whistle on a suspected drugs scam at a @entity10 base			1
dr @entity0 , who led the campaign for an inquest into the controversial death of @entity15 weapons expert dr @entity14 , was dismissed by the @entity3 after calling for a police investigation			1
he claims there was a ‘ cover - up of criminality ’ over the ordering and dispensing of 2,400mg of dangerous controlled drug morphine sulphate for a patient , instead of 400mg			1
the incident happened before dr @entity0 started work at the military camp ’s medical centre			1
but less than a month after telling bosses he believed a crime had taken place , he was sacked by text and email while on holiday in @entity35			2
now the doctor , whose ordeal has left him suffering stress , anxiety and depression , has won a legal battle to bring a whistleblowing claim against the @entity3 he is claiming substantial damages that could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
the @entity43 has long campaigned for the protection of public sector whistleblowers and has revealed how senior @entity47 doctors have been gagged by their hospitals when highlighting wrong - doing			0
last night dr @entity0 said : ‘ it is a great relief that the judge has allowed my claim to proceed			1
‘ i have dedicated much of my life to working as a doctor for the @entity54 and i took my job of treating sick and injured military personnel very seriously			0
‘ my summary dismissal came as a great shock to me and has seriously affected my health and my family life			0
’ @entity61 , dr @entity0 ’s solicitor and one of the country ’s leading specialists in employment law , said : ‘ dr @entity0 believes he was summarily dismissed because he shone a spotlight on potential criminality at a military barracks			1
‘ other members of staff involved continue to work for the @entity3 while my client has lost his livelihood			0
to this day it is unclear as to whether the matter was ever referred to the police			0
’ mr @entity61 said it was of ‘ great concern ’ the @entity3 had fought to get the case struck out on a technicality			2
‘ it is of immense public importance that whistleblowers enjoy maximum protection before the law , ’ he said			0
dr @entity0 , a civilian doctor who had worked for the @entity3 for nearly 20 years , was employed on a six - month contract at @entity87 , near @entity88 , @entity89 , when his ordeal began			1
in august 2013 – two weeks after he started the job – he was told a pharmacy technician had , a month earlier , mistakenly ordered and dispensed 40 60mg tablets of morphine sulphate , instead of 10mg pills			0
dr @entity0 checked with the patient who insisted the lower strength drugs had been handed out – leading the doctor to conclude the stronger tablets were missing			2
dr @entity0 was employed on a six - month contract at @entity87 ( pictured ) , near @entity88 , @entity89 , when his ordeal began he believed it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ the experienced pharmacy technician would have ordered and dispensed the 60mg tablets by mistake and concluded she may have been forced into some form of criminal activity			1
suspecting foul play , dr @entity0 expressed his concern to members of the practice team and a nurse - led internal investigation and said the matter was so serious the police should be informed			1
documents handed to the tribunal said : ‘ he considered a police investigation was required because it was likely a criminal offence ( blackmail , coercion or threats ) had taken place to procure controlled drug			2
’ on september 6 , 2013 , while climbing a mountain on holiday , dr @entity0 received a text and email @entity127 informing him his contract had been terminated			2
he was later informed he was barred from working on another military base			0
dr @entity0 led a campaign for a full inquest into chemical weapons expert dr @entity14 's ( pictured ) death he was not told why he had been sacked nor given a chance to defend himself			1
he maintains he was unlawfully dismissed for whistleblowing about a possible drugs racket			0
the @entity3 disputed dr @entity0 ’s case claiming it did not employ him but only hired him through a health recruitment agency , despite the fact he had worked almost exclusively for the military since 1996			1
defence chiefs also sought to strike out the claim on a technicality arguing he was not a whistleblower			0
throwing out the @entity3 ’s case at a pre-tribunal hearing , employment judge @entity144 said : ‘ the basis of the claim is that following dr @entity0 's participation in the investigation into incorrect dosage and dispensation of morphine he was summarily dismissed and banned from working as a doctor in the military			1
’ dr @entity0 led a campaign for a full inquest into dr @entity14 's death in woods near to his @entity162 home and a review of the investigation by @entity165			1
the chemical and biological weapons expert was found dead in july 2003 , shortly after being exposed as the source of a @entity169 claim that @entity171 's @entity170 had ' sexed up ' the case for war in @entity15			2
the @entity174 later found that dr @entity14 , a member of a @entity176 inspection team sent to @entity15 to unearth weapons of mass destruction , had committed suicide			0
however , many still believe the 59 - year - old scientist may have been murdered by the security services			0
no inquest has ever been held			0
a spokeswoman for @entity185 said the force had not been involved in any investigation at @entity188			0
an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ this case is subject to legal proceedings and it would be inappropriate for us to comment			2
