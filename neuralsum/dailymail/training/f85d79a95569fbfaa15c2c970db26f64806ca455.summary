@entity0 know they can ill - afford any sort of slip as they set off for @entity3			1
forget @entity4 , @entity5 and even @entity6 ; the @entity7 is the scene of @entity9 's most important night of what has been an indifferent four months			1
not since the @entity12 champions dispensed of @entity13 in may – an evening etched with nerves – on their way to the title have @entity0 had so much riding on a 90 minutes			1
but there was steely focus in the eyes as they embarked on the @entity23 capital			2
@entity69 is ready for what lies ahead			2
' @entity3 is a great atmosphere , and especially for this game because they have the same points			2
also for them to go through in the competition would be massive , ' he said			0
' as a player it is one of those games you really enjoy playing			0
you are playing against a top team and always the atmosphere there is just fantastic as well			2
' i think the @entity87 is the competition at the moment where we are not performing good enough , although it is true that the draw has always been difficult for us and we are a team that are learning about a lot of things			1
the @entity87 is that competition where you play against the best teams from @entity100 and if you make mistakes you are out of it			1
' i think @entity3 is a crucial game for us to show that we want to continue in that competition and we want to go far			0
the quality is there to do this and hopefully we can have a great game and go through			0
' the victory against @entity109 's @entity6 a fortnight ago was staggeringly intense and of great significance , but wednesday 's trip to @entity3 is that bit bigger			2
with the wealth of quality at his disposal , for @entity9 not to reach the @entity87 last - 16 would be unthinkable ; it could mark his eventual demise as the club 's manager			1
and they are so close , knowing a win at @entity122 would seal a spot for the second reason running			1
if they were n't to achieve the minimum requirement of progression , the failure would not be down to this week but those preceding it			0
@entity30 - sporting a @entity0 snood - throws the ball away during a goalkeeping session @entity37 looks as if he means business as the @entity0 players and management take a break the pressure is now intensified			1
but @entity0 save their very best to last			1
think @entity6 at the @entity139 , @entity140 on that final day			0
they will have to do it without @entity24 this time , however , who left the field in tears on saturday evening as they beat @entity145			1
nineteen goals already this season – including two late on against the @entity148 to keep their @entity150 hopes alive – goes a long way in pointing towards the @entity153 's importance			0
he will undoubtedly be a miss , but these @entity0 players know the importance of reaching the knockout stages			1
their careers in the @entity160 depend on it			0
' let 's be honest , we need to do something or otherwise next year it 's going to be new players , it 's going to be everything , ' said @entity45 ahead of the win against @entity6			0
' that 's how it works when you play for a big club			0
with the salary of every player and the level of those players , 90 per cent of the team is world class			0
city travel to @entity122 for a game they need to get a result from in order to progress in the @entity87 @entity39 dinks a ball beyond @entity186 striker @entity185 as @entity69 ( second left ) watches on @entity39 is likely to start up front for @entity9 's @entity12 champions in @entity3 on wednesday the @entity189 completed his sprinting drills at the back of the queue on tuesday morning ' then not to qualify from the first round of the @entity87 would be a huge blow for the club — and for us as well			1
with the players we have and everything , the owner gives us his trust , we have to return it in the @entity87			2
it 's the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best team in the world			0
' we have a chance to play for a big club and we are treated the right way			0
sometimes it 's not good to talk too much , it 's better to talk with your feet			0
we have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well			2
' the talking stops on wednesday , and do n't bet against @entity0 coming out of @entity23 with the result they need .			1

@entity0 travel to @entity122 in the @entity87 on wednesday
the @entity12 champions are used to performing under pressure
@entity9 will be without top *goalscorer* @entity24
