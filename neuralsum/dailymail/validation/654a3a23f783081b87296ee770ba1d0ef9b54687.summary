as we speak , more of such laws are being proposed , ' he said			0
' meanwhile , the @entity93 , the culmination of so much blood , so much sweat and tears , the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence ... stands weakened			0
' rev. @entity190 , the 45 - year - old pastor of the @entity192 church led by @entity37 at the height of the @entity97 , lamented that the measure was now in limbo			0
