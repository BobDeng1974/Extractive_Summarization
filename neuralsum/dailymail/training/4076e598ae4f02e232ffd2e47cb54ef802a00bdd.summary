such is the strength of @entity2 ’s squad this season , even the most expensive defender in the @entity5 , £ 32million @entity6 , acknowledges he is n’t guaranteed a regular starting place			1
@entity6 will miss out when the champions kick off their title defence against @entity10 having only arrived at the club from @entity12 on monday			1
but even when fully up to speed , the @entity13 faces competition from club captain @entity16 and @entity18 finalist @entity17 in the centre of defence			1
@entity21 , 21 , has already won 13 caps for @entity23			1
transfer : @entity13 defender @entity6 joined @entity2 for £ 32m from @entity12 ‘ guarantees do n’t exist , what really counts is how i play in training sessions and games when i get the chance			1
everybody in the squad wants to play and you can only put 11 players in the side , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ the only thing you can do as a player is make your own guarantees by doing well in training and giving the manager a difficult decision			2
there are plenty of games this season and i am sure i will get my chance			2
’ @entity47 has added @entity6 , goalkeeper @entity48 , right - back @entity49 and midfielders @entity51 , @entity53 and @entity54 to a squad already good enough to win the league			1
he now has two top - quality players for every position which means he can choose between @entity62 @entity61 @entity60 and @entity63 in goal , or @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 up front			2
the canny @entity69 even has the resources to rest some of his @entity18 stars for their @entity5 opener in the north - east			1
competition : @entity76 faces stiff competition if he wants to partner @entity16 in defence @entity47 had seven of his players from @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity13 and @entity83 reach the knockout stages in @entity82			2
some of them , like @entity16 , may be asked to face @entity10 after last sunday ’s 3 - 0 defeat in the @entity87 - but not all			2
‘ the most important thing is for players to have the rest that they need particularly between one season and the next , ’ said the @entity2 boss , who will be wary of throwing in @entity68 after his muscular problems last season			1
‘ most summers you have the @entity18 or @entity98 or @entity99 , it is very difficult			2
that ’s why i think players have so many injuries			2
not only in our team , in every team			0
‘ if i put all the @entity18 players in together , maybe after 50 minutes they would not continue			0
we will try to make a mix. of the eight who arrived late to pre-season , we will see which of them are in the right condition to play			0
’ new boys : @entity49 and @entity6 train for @entity2 pressure : the 23 - year - old says he is n't worried about his price tag as he did n't set it @entity6 glimpsed the size of his new club on thursday evening when he joined his team - mates at a glamorous event called @entity124 , in which 5,000 fans turned up to see the new signings and hear a musical set from legendary @entity129 guitarist @entity128			1
the 23 - year - old is n’t daunted by the size of his price tag which eclipses the record amount paid by @entity133 for @entity134 in 2002			0
‘ the price was n’t set by me and it ’s something i do n’t pay attention to			0
if you ca n’t live with that sort of pressure , football is n’t the job for you			0
stay at home and do another type of job , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m here because it ’s a chance to play alongside other quality players			0
from a career development point of view and to progress as a player , @entity2 were the club for me			1
’ right move : @entity6 said that @entity2 were the perfect club for him after leaving @entity12 he is setting his targets high , and not just domestically			1
‘ as current champions , the first thing is to hold onto that title			0
and the big picture for @entity2 has always been to try and ultimately win the @entity156 , so i think it has to remain a big target for us			1
’ @entity6 thinks he will be fit enough to fight for a place by the end of the month			1
today , some of the scrutiny will be on the dug - outs following a bust - up last season between manager @entity165 and @entity47			0
the @entity10 boss apologised for swearing at his counterpart and was later banned after headbutting @entity168 of @entity169			0
international : @entity6 comforts @entity170 after they lost to @entity172 at the @entity18 @entity47 bears no grudge and says he personally finds it helpful to stay calm after being more hotheaded earlier in his career as a player			1
‘ the most important thing is to be winning the game , not to be fighting with other managers , ’ he said			0
‘ i think if you are not calm , you are nervous , then you are not in the right mood at the right time			0
‘ i was another character when i was younger			0
more explosive and wanting to fight with other players			0
‘ after i finished my career as a player and started as a manager , i realised you must talk to all the other players in a calm way			0
