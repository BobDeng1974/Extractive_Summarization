it seems a week does n’t go by without a firm claiming to have designed a @entity3 - style hoverboard , but the latest device takes this a step further			0
dubbed @entity7 , it takes inspiration from @entity10 ’s iconic board , as well as the @entity11 and even drones to create what its creator calls an ‘ all electric personal air vehicle			1
’ riders ‘ fly ’ up to five feet ( 1.5 metres ) in the air on this stand - on craft that moves by reacting to shift ’s in the user ’s weight			1

mr @entity32 is expected to launch the $ 13,000 ( £ 8,485 ) @entity7 next year it can also be remotely controlled using a smartphone app. @entity7 was designed by @entity25 - based @entity24 and his prototype can carry a person weighing up to 220lbs ( 100kg ) without losing stability			1
dimensions ( open ) : 71 inches ( 180cm ) long and 69 inches ( 150cm ) high when open dimensions ( folder ) : 30 inches ( 80cm ) by 40 inches ( 110cm ) maximum weight : 220lbs ( 100kg ) maximum altitude : five feet ( 1.5 metres ) release date : 2016 @entity44 : $ 13,000 ( £ 8,485 ) he told @entity45 at the @entity46 that the production model should be able to withstand up to 264lbs ( 120kg ) without losing stability			1
in theory the board can also be used with heavier weights ‘ but it gets shaky ’ , continued mr @entity53			2
the board ‘ flies ’ thanks to four propellers fitted either side of the foot panels			1
these are powered by four separate electric motors , and each propeller is covered by a metal mesh , for safety reasons			1
like a @entity11 , the board moves in reaction to shifts in the rider ’s weight and flight altitude is controlled by an app. users can also remotely control @entity7 using this app that has been designed to work with the board ’s built - in gps and gyroscope			1

‘ @entity7 has a thermal core system , ’ said mr @entity53			2
‘ this system allows airflow from a thermal opening to flow inside the unibody and cool down the parts while passing more air to the propellers			2
‘ @entity7 is more than just scaled quadcopter			2
it is a new category of aircraft			0

the firm did n’t reveal how much the board weighs but said it is made from lightweight aluminium and titanium			0
@entity7 is expected to cost $ 13,000 ( £ 8,485 ) and the app comes with a built - in , location - based security alarm to deter thieves			1
the firm said @entity7 would be ideal for moving in extreme environments , such as over water and snow or in a desert			2
it added that military and emergency services could use it for search and rescue missions , or photographers could use it to film shots from the air			0
it 's not to be confused with the @entity7 , from @entity164 - based firm @entity163 , which was released last month			0
a device with the same name was released last month , by @entity164 - based firm @entity163			0
its @entity7 costs £ 499 ( $ 755 ) and is a self - balancing electric board that remains stationary until a user steps on it			1
riders then power the device by leaning forward , and the @entity7 reaches speeds of up to 12mph ( 19km/h )			0
the @entity7 uses similar technology to that seen on certain eco-friendly cars , and when travelling downhill or slowing , the battery charges itself			0
the gyroscope in the @entity7 means the spinning wheels are axle - free , so they can move in any direction while also keeping the device constantly balanced			0
plus , as soon as user steps down from the waterproof board , it stops moving			0
airboards are available to buy online , or from @entity186			0
