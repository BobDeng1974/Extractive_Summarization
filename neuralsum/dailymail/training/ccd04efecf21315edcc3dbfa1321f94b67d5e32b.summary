by @entity0 a fireman marches through the still smouldering trees and darkly scorched earth in a scene reminiscent of the aftermath of an @entity7 bush fire			1
elsewhere , flames and billowing smoke rise from what looks like a battlefield and paint the night sky			0
these extraordinary pictures tell the story of a nation in the grip of drought yesterday – @entity18 ’s hottest day of the year so far – when the tinder - dry conditions suddenly erupted in a series of wildfires			1
the devastation comes as the @entity23 today declared more areas as being officially in drought , following another dry month which has hit rivers and groundwater supplies			1
the blaze is believed to have been started by arsonists under control : firemen extinguish flames at @entity40 in @entity41 - the cause is still unknown inferno : the night sky is lit up by a blaze along the @entity46 border destroying more than 100 acres			1
crews battled for more than 12 hours to put it out in @entity32 , @entity50 , flames raged across 15 acres of scrubland , coming just yards from homes			1
terrified residents were forced to use garden hose pipes to keep away the blaze , which at times licked their properties			2
@entity58 battled for more than five hours to control the fire , which is believed to have been started by arsonists near a children ’s park			1
another blaze raged yesterday over 17 acres of the 500 - acre @entity40 near @entity64 , @entity41 , where more than 235,000 people have been buried since 1854			1
more than 40 firefighters tackled the flames as fire chiefs warned that the lack of rain and tinder box dry conditions in the @entity73 were the ' perfect recipe ' for wildfires			2
a @entity77 spokesman said today that no properties were affected by the blaze , which was brought under control by around 4pm , two hours after it started			1
he could not comment on the amount of damage caused to the cemetery - the largest in @entity18 - and the cause of the fire is unknown			1
six fire engines , a water tanker and specialist off - road vehicles were drafted in to attack the flames from different areas , the fire service said			1
unbelievable : firefighters battled for hours in both @entity32 and @entity95 yesterday to bring the grass fires under control beating it down : a firefighter beats a patch of flames on the common ground at @entity103 , known locally as @entity104			1
arsonists set the blaze alight , according to @entity107 fire service area manager @entity108 said wildfires were notoriously difficult to control , adding : ' these fires cause devastation to the countryside , wildlife and property			1
' they pose a risk to life , both to the public and the firefighters tackling these blazes			0
' each year , there are around 79,000 wildfires in the @entity18 - an average of 216 per day			1
@entity40 was consecrated by the @entity124 on november 7 , 1854 , and opened to the public six days later			1
at the time , it was believed to be the largest burial ground in the world			2
@entity129 leader @entity128 said : ' these blazes can start for all sorts of reasons			0
a moment of carelessness could result in devastation to the countryside and lives being put at risk			0
' as temperatures hit 23c ( 73f ) yesterday , a third fire broke out at @entity140 in the @entity46 borders , destroying more than 100 acres			1
crews battled for more than 12 hours to put it out			0
meanwhile , firefighters were returning to the hills above @entity146 , @entity147 , today after they spent yesterday afternoon tackling a large moor fire			2
crews from as far away as @entity150 and neighbouring @entity151 were brought in to tackle the blaze on @entity154 , above the village of @entity156 , shortly before 2pm			1
blaze : and in @entity46 a huge grass fire broke out at the foot of @entity159 , @entity160 , on the northern side of the @entity162 @entity163 : hundreds of acres of grass and heather has been burning out of control since yesterday on hills overlooking the @entity162			1
in this picture on the right a house stands perilously close to the flames burning : the blaze could be seen for miles around and across the @entity162 in @entity173			2
more than 30 firefighters and workers were called to @entity176 and @entity177 a spokeswoman for @entity179 said a large number of firefighters were needed ' due to the actual vastness of the moor ' and it was burning over three different fronts			0
one front is thought to be 200m long			0
the spokeswoman said there were five different seats of fire identified			2
one crew was left monitoring the blaze overnight			2
this morning , she said : ' this fire is still burning and will continue to for some days			2
a cause has not yet been confirmed but further details will be supplied during the next few days			0
' a moorland fire in @entity194 , @entity195 , was also under control today following an early morning inspection			1
crews from @entity195 and @entity199 were called to the blaze off @entity201 , near @entity202 , at about 5pm yesterday			2
they were confronted with a number of separate pockets of fire covering two square miles in what was described as a ' very large ' blaze			1
water firm @entity208 also provided specialist all - terrain vehicles to access remote parts of the areas affected , said @entity213			1
firefighters were withdrawn at 7pm due to fading light after they were satisfied that no property or livestock was at risk			0
a fire service spokeswoman confirmed the blaze had dissipated when crews returned at 5.30am today to reassess the situation			1
drought spreads to @entity151 , @entity224 and @entity225 swathes of @entity73 and @entity227 from @entity228 up to @entity229 are officially suffering from drought , with areas around @entity224 , @entity232 , @entity225 and @entity233 affected			1
the areas join the @entity73 and eastern @entity237 in drought , most of which has been affected since earlier this year , although parts of @entity240 have been suffering drought conditions since last summer			1
earlier this month , seven water companies across east and southern @entity237 announced hosepipe bans would come into force before @entity245 in a bid to conserve water supplies in the face of two unusually dry winters			0
but while the rivers @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity225 and @entity253 are at low or very low levels for the time of year , the @entity23 said public water supplies were unlikely to be affected in the region			1
@entity258 - which serves 4.7million customers - said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans at the moment			0
the company said its reservoirs were at 94 per cent , which was normal for the time of year , but groundwater levels in @entity267 were around a fifth below usual levels			0
as a result , the amount of water being taken from aquifers had been reduced and @entity225 ’s water supply was being supported by water drawn from the @entity253			2
location : the fire spread easily , across 15 acres between @entity277 , in allt - yr - yn , and @entity103 , known locally as @entity104 , towards the @entity280 barracks in a statement , the company said : ' as the dry weather continues , we will be keeping the local water resource situation under constant review			1
' our regional water supply system gives us flexibility , what it does n’t give us is an unlimited supply of water , so we would always encourage our customers to only use what they need , when they need it			0
' some parts of @entity151 have seen the driest 12 months since 1910 and river levels are continuing to fall , prompting the @entity23 to urge farmers and businesses taking water from rivers to use supplies wisely			2
@entity302 , head of water resources , said : ' today , south and east @entity147 have moved into official drought status , reflecting the impact that this extremely dry period is having on the environment in the area			0
' @entity23 must balance the water needs of people , farmers , businesses and the environment and we are working with businesses , farmers and water companies to plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought			0
' the news of drought conditions spreading to @entity151 comes after the @entity23 warned that drought would affect more parts of the country without well - above average rainfall in the coming weeks			1
and in its latest update last week , the agency said @entity237 and @entity33 had experienced another dry week , and in addition to areas in drought parts of the south west and @entity328 were also experiencing dry conditions			2
the outlook for @entity33 remained normal , although an exceptionally dry spring and summer could see that change , the @entity23 warned			0
the @entity23 has had to take steps to protect wildlife in the face of drought , including staging a fish rescue from the @entity337 in @entity338 this week , moving fish threatened by low water levels to another , deeper part of the river			0
the news of the drought spreading comes as the @entity346 ( @entity347 ) launched a campaign to raise public awareness of the connection between the health of @entity237 ’s rivers and people ’s water use			0
environment minister @entity355 said : ' it ’s especially important that we care for our rivers when they ’re facing the added pressure of drought , as well as the constant threats they face from over-use and pollution			0
' the fact that so many organisations have come together to back this campaign shows the depth of feeling about this issue , and the importance we all place on making sure our actions do n’t damage our rivers			0
' @entity374 , head of @entity375 for @entity376 , said : ' the amazing wildlife of our rivers and wetlands is under immense pressure from drought and other factors			0
' many of us would like to help but do n’t know what action to take			0
there are simple steps around water use that can make a real difference including turning off taps when cleaning our teeth			0
' hosepipe bans – due to start on april 5 – have already been imposed by seven water companies in the south and east of @entity237 , affecting 20million customers			0
@entity258 is one of six firms which failed to meet leakage reduction targets set by the regular @entity399 last year , along with @entity400 and @entity402 water			0
sunning on the dock of the bay : dawn over the sill waters of the small fishing village of @entity408 near @entity409			0
temperatures are set to remain high until the weekend across the @entity18 golden brown : @entity412 , silhouetted palm trees on @entity414 in @entity409 on tuesday morning give the scene a beautiful sepia hue ; meanwhile , right , @entity417 , 19 , and @entity418 , 18 , take a splash around in the waves as the hot weather warms @entity423 beach in @entity424 basking in the warmth : new spring lambs watch a hot air balloon over @entity428 during perfect weather conditions for flying in the crystal clear skies			2
