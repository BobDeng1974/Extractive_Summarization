by @entity0 a dog owner was mortified to hear his @entity2 was responsible for causing a town 's residents six months of misery slashing car tyres			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were shown @entity10 footage of their very own @entity2 , named @entity12 , caught red - handed slashing a neighbour 's car - evidence that cracked the case of the culprit responsible for months of vandalism			1
officers were left clueless when residents in @entity20 , @entity21 , started to regularly report damage to their tyres			1
solved : the phantom car vandal of an old market town was finally unmasked as @entity12 the @entity2 eventually , residents in the street were so annoyed they installed @entity10 to try and catch who was responsible			1
and , after spending six months and countless hours studying cctv police got the lead when it transpired that @entity12 had been using her daily walk to bite the two nearside tyres of cars she came across - causing slow punctures and flat tyres by morning			1
@entity12 had been allowed off her lead while being walked by her owners and had been nipping the tyres without them noticing			1
@entity8 and @entity39 have reimbursed fellow residents since the matter @entity12 ' actions were revealed @entity39 and @entity12 was revealed to be the cause of a spate of car tyres being ripped over a period of six months mrs @entity8 , 76 , a retired @entity47 , said : ' we are both just mortified			1
' she is the most obedient and affectionate dog we have ever had and it is just shocking to hear this terrible news			2
' we are very distressed by what has @entity53 could n't believe it when i saw the @entity10 footage			1
' to think that @entity12 has done this has made me feel very sad			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity59 confirmed ten reports of vandalism had been reported in the last six months			1
it is believed , though , that there will be other residents who have suffered flat tyres because of @entity12 and thought nothing of it			2
residents were upset that car tyres had been left repeatedly punctured over the past six months so set up @entity10 in the village of @entity20 , @entity21 the elderly couple have reimbursed fellow residents since the matter was resolved			1
the couple have have had @entity12 for two - and - a - half years			0
mrs @entity8 added : ' i have had six dogs over the last 50 years and none have ever been like @entity12			0
' when i call her she comes straight away			0
' this is why we usually do n't walk her on her lead			0
she is such a lovely dog and very spirited			0
' from now on though , we will have to start to walk her on her lead			0
the couple have have had @entity12 for two - and - a - half years and said ' she must get over-excited when she has had a good run ' ' @entity2 's are hard working dogs , and are trained to nip sheep			0
i think she must get over-excited when she has had a good run			0
' the mechanic at a local car garage who has been inundated with punctures in recent months said : ' i was having to replace car tyres every couple of weeks			1
' everyone thought it was someone with a knife			0
' i am glad it is resolved now , but it is very unfortunate for the people involved			0
' @entity101 @entity100 , who solved the mystery , said : ' these incidents have been happening for the last six months , with many residents being very upset at the thought of someone targeting them and causing the damage deliberate			2
' the dog had been seen approaching the cars and many believe that she was just sniffing at the tyres			2
it isnâ € ™ t until you take a closer look , that you can see her biting the tyres			2
' the owner has been contacted and has been very surprised and also apologetic about the whole situation			0
he will be now keeping @entity12 on a lead			0
' we know that there may be other residents or visitors that may not have reported any damage to their tyres			1
we want to reassure them that the culprit has been identified and hopefully the damage will stop			2

car owners in @entity20 , @entity21 , repeatedly reported damage
some had slow punctures , others found their tyres completely flat
it left officers from @entity59 baffled
that was until they studied @entity10 footage , and realised who it was
