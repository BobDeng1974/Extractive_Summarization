@entity0 chalked up his first big win in @entity2 on sunday night by beating the mighty @entity3			1
he is not yet two months in to his @entity5 adventure but the signs are that he can be a success in @entity8			2
@entity9 looks at the story so far ... beating @entity3 as a springboard still beaming after sunday night ’s win , @entity0 admitted post-match : ‘ when we scored after two minutes i turned to my assistant @entity15 and said : " we could do with the final whistle coming now "			1
it was backs - against - the - walls stuff for most of the game but the resilience , intensity and defensive organisation that he has tried to instil in his new charges was there for all to see			2
@entity0 shakes hands with @entity28 after his @entity30 side beat @entity3 @entity31 ( right ) and @entity32 celebrate @entity30 's winner - a @entity34 own goal the temptation from the club president @entity37 will now be not to spend in the january transfer market with the club very keen to make the most of its excellent youth system			1
but @entity0 stressed on sunday night : ' we need to add quality if we want to be at the top end of the table			1
i love the philosophy of the club and want to work within that but you also need experience			0
' the changes he has made the first thing he noticed upon turning up in the @entity58 last november was that the players were not fit			2
after a shambolic pre-season , not helped by having to play @entity62 qualifiers , the players were not ready for the rigours of a tough season			0
‘ it ’s not something you can change in the middle of a campaign , ’ he said			0
‘ people will notice the difference in the coming months and definitely next season			0
’ he will have been delighted with how well they held out on sunday night after fading badly in the second half of many games since he took over			1
he will also have been delighted with the defensive organisation			0
he can be seen , on the usually cold and wet training pitches of @entity80 , pulling his defenders into position as part of the defensive drills he has leaned heavily upon since his arrival to bring some order to the team			0
apart from a nightmare second half against @entity91 when they conceded four , the side have been very hard to score against under @entity0			1
@entity0 has put in plenty of work in on the training pitch and @entity30 are beginning to reap the benefits settling in he is still staying in the city ’s @entity97 hotel which overlooks the @entity100 river as it meets the @entity101 ( hence no rush to find permanent accommodation ) but he is keen to pick out a family home as he puts down roots in one of the most picturesque regions of @entity2			1
it rains a lot and it stays colder than most other parts of the peninsula so there is no beating sun to hide from			0
@entity0 wants to make the often inclement conditions at the club ’s @entity117 part of @entity30 ’s armoury – other teams do n’t want to visit northern @entity2 ; @entity3 did n’t much fancy the 9pm kick - off on sunday and @entity0 sees that as a potential advantage			1
talking a good game he is taking lessons but the enormity of learning another language aged 51 when you are also a full - time football manager has already hit home			2
@entity131 had a @entity133 teacher shadow him for the six months that led up to him taking the reins at @entity136 , @entity137 locked himself away for several weeks before beginning his @entity139 adventure at @entity140 and others like @entity142 have been fluent in other languages since school age			0
@entity145 wears a @entity30 scarf during his unveiling at the @entity148 back on november 13 @entity0 shares a joke with the media during a press conference to preview the @entity3 match nov 22 : @entity153 ( a ) , @entity5 , d 0 - 0 nov 28 : @entity154 ( @entity155 ) , @entity5 , w 3 - 0 dec 4 : @entity157 ( a ) , @entity156 , d 0 - 0 dec 7 : @entity91 ( a ) , @entity5 , l 0 - 4 dec 14 : @entity158 ( @entity155 ) , @entity5 , @entity159 1 - 1 dec 17 : @entity157 ( @entity155 ) , @entity156 , w 2 - 0 dec 20 : @entity160 ( a ) , @entity5 , d 1 - 1 @entity161 : @entity3 ( @entity155 ) , @entity5 , w 1 - 0 overall : @entity163 @entity162 @entity0 is determined but it will not be easy			1
his ‘ dos , tres , cuatro times ’ press conference effort became an internet hit and he also shouted out ‘ @entity169 ! ’ when there is no such player at @entity30 during his first match			2
but the main thing is that he is making the effort and the effort is being appreciated			0
many of @entity30 ’s players speak @entity139			2
former @entity180 midfielder @entity179 has already told @entity9 that @entity0 ’ @entity139 is easier to understand that @entity182 ’s so there seems to be no great communication problem			1
a translator is at @entity0 ’ side during training sessions and press officer @entity187 ( son of the great @entity2 and @entity30 goalkeeper ) is also fluent and constantly on hand to help the new manager			1
what the future holds he has already stressed the priority is to pull away from the bottom and not be in a relegation dog - fight at the end of the season			0
but he is always well aware that only last season @entity199 were playing in the @entity201 so he needs to push them back towards the top four as soon as possible			0
to do that he will need to be allowed to bring in quality this january			0
the club are very keen to use its excellent b - team youth side @entity8			0
@entity0 buys into the philosophy because he knows it well from his @entity209 days but he is also keen to be allowed to go out and get a @entity210 or @entity211 just to add that extra touch of quality and experience			1
@entity0 is hoping that the @entity8 club will back him in the transfer market during the january window			2

former @entity220 and @entity209 manager took over in november
