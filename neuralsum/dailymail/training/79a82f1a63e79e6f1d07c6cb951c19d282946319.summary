by @entity0 where does @entity2 ’s stunning eight - stroke success at the 114th @entity3 at @entity4 stand among the great major championship performances of the last 30 years ? @entity7 was kind enough to place it above his own masterclass at @entity10 three years ago , which would slot it just below @entity13 at his absolute best at @entity15 in 2000 and at his absolute bravest at @entity17 in 2008			1
personally , i would n’t go that far			0
@entity7 was 23 when he won by eight , the youngest winner since @entity20 in 1923			1
@entity2 is 29 , the sort of age you might expect a golfer to pull off an astounding feat , if he has it within him			1
how good was it ? : @entity2 won the @entity28 at @entity4 and @entity29 by eight strokes admirable : @entity2 won his second major championship in style ahead of @entity33 ( right ) and @entity34 you could see the difference in the admirable manner in which the @entity38 managed his game			1
i did n’t rate his chances because he is relatively poor from the tight lies that were prevalent around the greens , but @entity2 solved that problem with the age - old solution of reaching for his putter			1
he showed the humility of a champion at the 7th hole during the final round , when a bunker lay between his ball and the flag			0
most pros would have taken the challenge on and risked the double bogey , but @entity2 acknowledged his weakness , putted the ball to 20ft and took his one - stroke punishment			1
other than that , he was practically blemish free as he followed up his wire - to - wire success on the lush @entity62 acres at the @entity63 last month with a similar triumph at burnished @entity4			1
peak performance : @entity13 was at his finest in 2000 when he won the @entity28 at @entity15 young gun : @entity7 was 23 when he won the @entity28 at @entity67 in 2011 it would be no surprise if he went on a sir @entity71 - like streak and won a bunch of majors in a relatively short space of time			1
the last time he was this good , after he won the 2010 @entity76 , he promptly fell apart			1
here was another private man finding it difficult to cope with the spotlight			0
‘ i was doing countless interviews and i thought i had to say something and make headlines , ’ explained @entity2			1
‘ now i ’m comfortable just being myself			0
’ while a step behind @entity85 , @entity7 and @entity86 in terms of ballstriking , the advantage he has is his deadliness with the putter			2
while the aforementioned trio are streaky , @entity2 ’s perfect technique rarely lets him down			2
‘ he ’s definitely a more complete player now than in 2010 and his short game is improving all the time , ’ said his @entity94 caddie @entity93 , whose own part in @entity2 ’s success should not be underestimated			1
‘ he was talking with @entity100 ( @entity101 ) before he went out , who was telling him “ let ’s get closer to that @entity38 @entity104 ”			2
now there ’s only one to go			0
’ balanced : when @entity2 won the @entity76 in 2010 he did n't know how to handle it top team : the influence of @entity2 's caddie @entity93 ( right ) should not be underestimated with @entity101 chipping in with two masters titles , the only one left is the @entity3 , to be staged next month at @entity113 with its plethora of deep bunkers			1
@entity2 , as it happens , might be as good as anyone in the world right now out of sand			2
then there ’s the @entity121			0
the last time at @entity123 he was struggling but showed his unbending nerve by sinking the winning putt			0
this time at @entity126 he will be the rock of @entity129 ’s team			0
‘ he ’s got the whole package and he ’s obviously someone you would n’t relish facing , ’ said @entity130			0
one month after @entity85 ’s elevation to world no 1 , @entity2 ’s victory was another significant landmark for one of the game ’s quiet men			2
@entity140 - free , with all his energies and focus on the task at hand			0
there ’s a lesson there , for those willing to learn			0
how nice that @entity149 ’s first event as a dame just happens to be the biggest tournament in the women ’s game ; the @entity28			1
and how fitting that it ’s on a @entity4 course she will adore			2
if you must give out gongs to people for playing games , it ’s hard to think of a more fitting recipient than this 50 - year - old standard bearer			0
rewarded : now dame @entity149 , the @entity164 golfer will compete in the women 's @entity28 at @entity4 ‘ i ’m sure my mates will give me a bit of ribbing over my new title , ’ she said , and you can be sure @entity167 will give it back with the same free spirit that has characterised her play all these years			1
‘ i heard @entity2 has been allowed to play the number three course all week			2
is that true ? ’ @entity178 @entity177 wryly sums up the widely - held sense of incredulity among his fellow competitors regarding @entity2 ’s earth - shattering performance at @entity183 2 last week			0
impressed : @entity177 is n't alone in his head - shaking admiration of @entity2 's dominant @entity28 performance ‘ the world ’s worst - kept secret , ’ said @entity187 , chief executive of the @entity188 , announcing the return of @entity190 to the @entity3 rota on monday			1
although it was still secret enough , apparently , to escape the person doing the @entity197 ’s @entity140 feed			0
‘ still some distance away , ’ was the official tweet in reaction to the story in these pages last month			0
out of the bag : @entity188 chief executive @entity187 ( second left ) announced the return of @entity190 in @entity204 to the @entity3 rota			0

@entity2 won the 114th @entity28 at @entity4 by eight shots on *sunday*
@entity7 says the @entity38 's effort was better than his own in 2011
@entity7 was the youngest @entity28 winner since @entity20 in 1923
@entity2 says he 's more comfortable within himself than he was in 2010 when he won the @entity76 but could n't back it up
his caddie @entity93 says @entity2 's a more complete player now
@entity149 plays her first tournament as a @entity217 at women 's @entity28
