do n't get emotionally attached to a property ( until you own it ) while it can be easy to fall in love with a beautiful house , never compromise your bidding position by making a property the be all and end all			1
the advice from both experts is to remember that there will always be another property , and there is no ' ultimate house '			1
' do n’t get emotionally involved in a property , and only pay what you think it ’s worth , ' said mr @entity69			0
this is especially important to keep in mind when looking to buy at auction , as emotions can get the best of you if you get caught up in the excitement of buying a property then and there			2

' have an amount of money which you are prepared to spend , and do n’t go over that amount , ' said mr @entity52			0
the same goes for interest rates , and mr @entity52 advises that prospective buyers should assume that mortgage interest rates will increase over time			1
' assume that the mortgage interest will reach long term average levels and increase , ' he said			0
' @entity16 at the moment has very low interest rates , and people often believe these rates will be maintained very long time , but the @entity190 has indicated that the rate of growth will increase in 2016			2
' do n't buy for the short term while buying for investment can be a very lucrative option , mr @entity69 advises that when purchasing for personal use , it 's best to look at the long term as buying and reselling can end up costing you more than it 's worth			1
' when buying property for yourself , look for the actual property that you want to live in long term , ' he said			2

he advises to make sure you buy at the right time , which may mean waiting until the next set of interest rates are released			2
