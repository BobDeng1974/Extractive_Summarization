professor @entity0 who has urged the public to go to pharmacies if they are unwell rather than @entity3 or their gp surgeries patients are being urged to stay away from hospital casualty units this winter over concerns that they are already under ‘ unprecedented ’ strain			1
the @entity10 ’s medical director , professor @entity0 , yesterday urged the public to go to pharmacies if unwell rather than @entity3 or gp surgeries			1
health secretary @entity14 also announced that an extra £ 300million had been freed up to help struggling hospitals pay for extra beds and staff over the coming months			1
some 28,000 extra patients a week are arriving in @entity3 units compared with this time last year , with the result that many hospitals are already overcrowded			1
the situation is expected to worsen in the coming weeks as patients succumb to chest infections and wards are shut due to the winter vomiting bug			1
professor @entity0 said a lot of the strain on @entity3 departments and gp surgeries could be relieved if people used pharmacies more			1
‘ many of these have private consultation rooms where you can get quite good advice and you do n’t have to wait in a pharmacy , ’ he added			0
‘ you can generally see someone in a matter of minutes			0
they can either recommend off - the - shelf treatment or , if appropriate , send you to your gp or to attend @entity3			2
’ mr @entity14 issued a warning that the pressures on @entity3 were unsustainable			2
‘ are things going to go on like this ? are we going to have to keep putting more and more sums into the @entity10 ? ’ he said			0
‘ the answer is it is not sustainable in the long run to say all the extra pressure in the @entity10 has to be borne by the @entity3 department			2
’ the ‘ bed occupancy rate ’ of hospitals is running at 88 per cent , compared with the 85 per cent considered safe			2
some , including @entity58 , are above 95 per cent			0
if hospitals are too overcrowded there is a greater risk of infection			1
the situation in hospitals and gp surgeries is expected to worsen in the coming weeks as patients succumb to chest infections ( file pic ) @entity69 , chief executive of the @entity70 , which supports hospitals , said many were significantly more crowded than this time last year			1
he said higher numbers of older patients were coming into hospital with a range of ‘ complicated conditions ’ and having to stay longer			0
it is estimated the extra funding announced by mr @entity14 can pay for the equivalent of 1,000 extra doctors , 2,000 nurses and 2,500 beds			2
hospitals will also hire agency staff as well as paying overtime to staff			2
they will also reopen wards and departments which had been closed			0
but doctors ’ leader @entity92 , of the @entity94 , said : ‘ while extra funding is desperately needed , this announcement is merely a sticking plaster			0
many hospitals are already at , and in places over , capacity			0
’ he warned that the @entity10 ‘ needs a long - term plan rather than a short - term fix ’			0
some 28,000 extra patients a week are arriving in @entity3 units compared with this time last year ( file picture ) the @entity10 has missed its target that 95 per cent of @entity3 patients are treated within four hours every week for the past year			1
last week 417,000 patients arrived in @entity3 , compared with 389,000 the same week last year			1
some 104,000 had to be admitted , up from 98,700 last year			0
shadow health secretary @entity110 said : ‘ throwing money at it when winter ’s about to start is not good enough			1
‘ @entity114 ’s a&es are getting worse , not better , and this panic move is too little to stop the @entity10 facing a difficult winter			0
it is further evidence @entity119 ca n’t be trusted with it			0
