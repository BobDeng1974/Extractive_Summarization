upset : @entity0 took issue with how he was treated at @entity2 in @entity3 one of the world 's richest men has been banned from top @entity7 restaurant @entity8 after the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he did n't get his favorite table			1
@entity0 , a pharmaceutical billionaire who boasts of his celebrity friends and his lavish lifestyle , reportedly sent a email of complaint to @entity8 owner @entity16			1
@entity0 admits having a disagreement with a female manager but he denies threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call , according to the @entity20			1
the paper reports that after the face - to - face confrontation with the manager , he sent a caps - locked tirade to @entity16 , he cc'ed a group of his famous friends including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
three additional recipients have some political pull , including police commissioner @entity34 , @entity0 's ' buddy ' @entity35 , and actor @entity36 who co-owns the restaurant chain with @entity16			1
the dispute stems from an incident where the 66 - year - old allegedly got into a verbal altercation with the restaurant 's manager @entity42 when @entity0 tried to get his favorite table on the night of his wife 's surprise birthday party			1
he reportedly walked up to an occupied table and asked the group who was dining there to move so that he could have ' his ' table			2
a bartender told the paper that the group refused and he offered to pay their bill if they would agree			0
powerful pals : @entity0 prides himself on his celebrity connections , seen here with prince @entity58 at a polo match close : @entity0 ( right ) sent an email complaint to the owner of @entity8 and cc'ed a number of celebrities including @entity27 ( second right )			1
though in this picture , @entity64 , her husband @entity65 , and @entity66 did n't get the email @entity0 , who calls himself ' @entity69 - the no. 1 @entity70 ' , then left an irate message for @entity42 , who was not at the restaurant at the time of the interaction			1
she did not call him back immediately so he went to the restaurant on 57th street to have it out with her in person			0
' he called me the c - word and said he would kill me , ' @entity42 told @entity81			0
@entity0 tells a different version of the story			2
he told @entity81 that @entity42 was supposed to meet him at his office to plan the party in question , so he went to the restaurant to give her a piece of his mind			0
' i told her " i ca n't stand you			0
" did i curse at her or threaten to kill her ? no true - please			0
i would never say that , ' @entity0 told the paper			2
leading ladies : @entity0 has been pictured with @entity93 ( left ) and model @entity94 ( right ) feeling like his message may not be clear , @entity0 decided to send the email to @entity16 and copy his a-list pals			1
' i guess that @entity98 much too busy to call back an upset customer			0
i had told u that i had a @entity101 & a very uncomfortable experience concerning a surprise party for a very very close friend this past weds , ' he wrote in the email			0
@entity0 , who owned drug manufacturer @entity107 until he sold it for $ 1.3billion in 2010 , went on to talk about his wealth in the email , using it as an unexpected way to rub his business savvy in @entity16 's face			1
' i had only 3 employees & revenues of only $ 40,000 ... when i recently sold my company last year i employed almost 2,000 employees n revenues of $ 5,000,000,000 ( thats what 5 billion ( @entity119 ' as in @entity121 ... ' he wrote in the angry - and typo - laden - email			0
similar skin colors : @entity0 , seen here with close friend @entity35 , also sent the real estate mogul the email complaining about the service he received at @entity8 banned : now @entity0 is no longer welcome at any of @entity8 's 25 locations around the world now , @entity0 is no longer welcome at any of the 25 international @entity8 locations			2
given his propensity to go heavy on the self tanner ( having had a skin cancer scare several years ago ) and trademark uniform of purple t - shirts and yellow @entity137 sunglasses , it would be easy to spot him if he tried to sneak in			0
this is far from the first time that @entity0 has used his connections to make a point , as he was described in a @entity143 profile of showing off his hundreds of posed photos with various celebrities			2
and he has no problem expressing his distaste for others : he openly bad - mouthed @entity149 , calling him ' the most selfish guy i know out of the 500 celebrities on this wall ' , and had a @entity154 back - and - forth over a slight to comedian @entity155 .			0

@entity0 was upset because another group was seated at ' his ' table
sent an angry email to the owner of the restaurant and cc'ed celebrities
he admits to the *argument* but denies having threatened the manager
