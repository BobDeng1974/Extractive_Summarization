by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 admits he has a fight on his hands to keep @entity6 's no 1 jersey this season – but is confident he 'll win his duel with summer signing @entity9			1
the @entity12 goalkeeper was restored to the side for sunday 's 2 - 0 victory at @entity15 after @entity16 had debuted in the @entity17 seven days earlier			1
the suspicion is the @entity19 would have kept his place had @entity6 not lost 3 - 0 to @entity21			1
but manager @entity22 – who worked with @entity16 at @entity23 – started the @entity25 season with @entity2 and he will continue between the posts when the champions host @entity28 on monday			1
competition : @entity6 keeper @entity2 is under pressure from summer signing @entity9 safe hands : @entity2 collects the ball under pressure from @entity35 during @entity6 's 2 - 0 win at @entity15 @entity2 , though , was dropped by @entity22 in favour of @entity38 after a string of gaffes last season			1
and the 27 - year - old accepts he faces a new challenge following the £ 6million arrival of @entity16			1
' that 's who we are as a club			2
no - one can afford to rest , no - one is undroppable and no - one is guaranteed to play every game , ' said @entity2 , who is currently in talks over a new contract at the @entity55			1
' we all have to perform and that includes me			0
i 'm a fighter , i 've been a fighter all my life			0
i 'll continue to do that			0
i am ready to fight and i 'm looking forward to hopefully keeping this position for a long time			0
' @entity2 missed seven league matches when he was axed last november and expects to sit out a few more this time around , if only because of @entity22 's rotation policy as @entity6 compete on four fronts			1
look around , everyone has ( two ) quality keepers , ' he said			0
' sometimes stuff happens and goalkeeper is an important position , so you need two good keepers			0
' @entity16 is a great signing			2
we were sorry to lose @entity38 to @entity75 and we wish him well			0
' but @entity9 has come in - we know he 's a great keeper after what he 's done at @entity23			1
he wants to play as much as i do , but i 've got the place at the moment and i 'm going to do everything i can to keep it			0
' new boy : @entity16 arrived from @entity22 's former club @entity23 for £ 6million this summer high praise : @entity2 ( left ) has described @entity16 ( right ) as a ' great goalkeeper ' for the time being , however , @entity2 is enjoying the view			1
@entity6 barely broke sweat at @entity88 as goals from @entity90 and @entity91 got their title defence off to a winning start			2
and @entity2 added : ' i 've always enjoyed watching this team			2
it 's a great team to play for and they 're a great bunch to train with			2
' for most of them it comes off more than not , so you ca n't really say they are flair players - they 're just quality players			2
' we feel really settled as a team			0
we 've had a good year under this manager and we feel ready to kick on			0
this club wants to do well and nobody wants to do better than this group of players			0
