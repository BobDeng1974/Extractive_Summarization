by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 16:49 est , 29 august 2013 a @entity2 attack on @entity3 could provoke reprisals ranging from missile strikes to terrorist attacks and cyberwar , according to government officials and private analysts			1
@entity2 military commanders are preparing contingency plans for a potential counter-strike by @entity3 's military , defense officials have revealed			1
the officials expressed confidence that the @entity2 and @entity2 regional allies such as @entity18 could deter or neutralize an immediate response from @entity3 president @entity20			1
a @entity22 defense official said the purpose of building up large forces near @entity3 - mostly in the form of naval assets - was to deter @entity20			1
' the important thing is to have enough force to control the escalatory response , ' said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
even so , ' there is no military action without risk , and a punitive strike on @entity3 regime forces would carry some			1
weapons could hit unintended targets , perhaps killing civilians , ' @entity38 of the @entity39 think tank wrote this week			1
' the regime could strike back in unexpected ways against @entity2 and allied interests , or it could resort to further ( chemical weapons ) attacks inside @entity3			1
' @entity3 and its close regional ally , @entity50 , both are widely believed to have ballistic missiles capable of reaching @entity18 and other @entity2 allies nearby , such as @entity54 and @entity55			1
@entity56 , the @entity57 militia backed by @entity58 and fighting on @entity20 's side in @entity3 , has tens of thousands of short - range rockets in southern @entity62 , near @entity18 's border			1
a coalition spearheaded by the @entity2 , @entity65 and @entity66 is preparing to punish @entity20 for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week the hope is that the attacks will deter @entity20 from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future many analysts predict that @entity3 and its allies will avoid a direct conflict with the @entity2 and opt instead for an ' asymmetric response ' aimed at @entity80 vulnerabilities - terror or cyber attacks , for example			1
@entity20 also could opt not to respond to a strike , hoping to wait out the @entity2 and allied military threat			2
a @entity2 official with experience in the @entity88 said that @entity89 also is concerned that @entity50 could turn up the heat in @entity91			2
so far , resurgent violence by @entity94 militants there has not been answered with retaliation from @entity57 militias with ties to @entity58			2
there are still militias in @entity91 ' that would respond most likely if the @entity50 put pressure on them , ' said the official , who is not authorized to comment publicly on the matter			2
' it 's something that 's of concern , and something that 's on everybody 's minds			2
' the potential for retaliation by @entity3 or its allies is among the growing concerns in the @entity113 and elsewhere about president @entity115 's moves toward launching missile strikes against @entity3 in light of its apparent use of chemical weapons against civilians outside @entity122 on august 21			1
some lawmakers and analysts say they worry that @entity89 could be sucked into @entity3 's 2 - 1/2 - year - old civil war - something @entity115 has long resisted			2
others argue that a few volleys of missiles aimed at @entity3 military facilities would have little effect , and might even embolden @entity20			2
' it is vital we avoid shortsighted military action that would have little impact on the long - term trajectory of the conflict			2
we ca n't simply launch a few missiles and hope for the best , ' senator @entity138 , the top @entity139 on the @entity140 , said on wednesday			2
how @entity3 itself will respond will be key , although many analysts expect @entity20 initially will simply absorb any strikes as long as they do not appear intended to decapitate his government			2
hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks on wednesday , including many women and children activists say that somewhere near 1,300 were killed in the chemical weapons attack on wednesday near @entity122			1
@entity3 has one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons of any country ' i think the calculation will be , " let 's just hunker down , take what we think will be a limited series of strikes and then just live to fight another day , ' " said @entity163 of the @entity164			0
' i 'd be surprised if @entity20 tried to respond because that would just further draw the @entity2 into an engagement , ' said @entity163 , who recently served on @entity115 's @entity168 staff			0
' he probably has the calculation that if the @entity2 becomes decisively engaged that he 's unlikely to survive			0
' @entity50 's military chief of staff , @entity170 , was quoted by a state - run @entity50 news agency on wednesday as promising that ' any attack on @entity3 would burn down @entity18 '			1
but @entity50 seems unlikely to directly attack @entity18 , which almost certainly would deliver a robust military response			1
and @entity50 's newly inaugurated president , @entity174 , took office promising to improve @entity58 's foreign relations			0
@entity50 could turn to @entity56 , however , to accomplish its goals			0
would bombing @entity3 be lawful ? @entity65 and the @entity2 insist it would be , but the truth is far from clear			0
it ’s hard to see how @entity3 ’s reported chemical attacks against its own citizens present a direct threat to either country			1
what specific laws or @entity186 conventions might be used as justification ? the @entity188 allows for military action on only two grounds – in self - defence , or if action is approved by the @entity193			0
@entity195 has made clear its intention to veto any proposed @entity168 resolution authorising action – as has @entity199			0
can a military strike be legal without a @entity186 resolution ? unclear			0
in 1999 , the @entity203 bombing campaign against @entity204 was launched without one , with @entity205 and president @entity206 seeking to justify it on humanitarian grounds to protect @entity210 civilians			0
the intervention was widely welcomed , but its legality was questionable			0
a similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in @entity3			0
if president @entity20 is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people , he will be in breach of the @entity220 , an international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which @entity3 is a signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons			1
but breaching the protocol does n’t provide a clear justification for military action and it normally applies to international conflicts , rather than civil wars			0
does the @entity186 have a ‘ responsibility to protect ’ the @entity3 ? in 2005 , following the hideous atrocities committed in @entity232 and @entity233 in the 1990s , the @entity186 brought forward an initiative called the ‘ responsibility to protect ’			0
it was designed to protect the innocent from genocide , war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders , and an obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere			0
but former @entity186 assistant secretary - general , @entity245 , says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force			0
all diplomatic efforts must have been tried first , and even then military intervention requires the backing of the @entity168 – taking @entity252 and president @entity115 back to square one			0
' a @entity56 attack on @entity18 is likely , and in fact some are speculating about yet another @entity56 - @entity18 war in @entity62 , ' said @entity258 , a lecturer in @entity88 studies at the @entity260			1
' @entity50 and @entity3 can target coalition cyber-based infrastructure and other potential targets , ' @entity258 added			0
' they prove to be quite capable in that domain			0
' a pro-hezbollah religious leader , sheikh @entity265 , warned on tuesday that a @entity2 strike on @entity3 ' would be met by harsh responses against @entity2 interests in the region and against @entity18 directly , ' according to @entity62 's @entity271 newspaper			1
yet @entity56 's calculations might be complex too			0
the group has sent thousands of fighters into @entity3 to help @entity20 quash mostly @entity94 rebels , stretching its capabilities and sparking apparent attacks against it by @entity94 back in @entity62			1
' @entity56 may say , " actually , i do n't want to get sucked in further over @entity20 's poor decision to use chemical weapons , ' " said @entity280 , author of a book on @entity56 that is due to be released next week			0
@entity50 , @entity3 and @entity56 ' are all inclined to do the asymmetric thing , ' @entity280 said			0
@entity56 's most likely response , he said , will be to tell operatives already in the field who are planning violent attacks ' to speed up ' .			1

they *cautioned* could provoke revenge attacks home and *abroad*
confident that @entity18 and allies in region could deter immediate response
