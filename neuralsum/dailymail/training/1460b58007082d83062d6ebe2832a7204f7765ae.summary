@entity1 scientists are recreating the deaths of some of the world 's most famous personalities by reconstructing their last moments using scents and sounds			1
from the sweet smell of @entity14 's perfume , mingled with the scent of @entity17 's blood to @entity19 's last drug - fuelled moments in a @entity21 bathtub , scientists at @entity11 university say they offer visitors a unique , if somewhat macabre , historical snapshot			1
the controversial museum exhibit is currently on display at the @entity26 in the @entity1 , with plans to send it across @entity29			1
not your normal museum exhibit : visitors are invited to lie in a series of four silver metal boxes similar to those found in a morgue , where smells and sounds of famous deaths are piped in visitors are invited to lie in a series of four silver metal boxes similar to those found in a morgue			1
the boxes , which are pitch - dark inside , are rigged with pipes leading to bottles containing pressurised smells			1
a soundtrack is played and different scents are released into the box to recreate a specific ' final moment '			2
for about five minutes , visitors can relive the smells and sounds believed to have surrounded four people whose deaths are etched into the world 's collective memory : @entity17 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity19			1
' we all have seen the images of @entity17 's assassination , but what did it smell like ? ' asks @entity67 , of the communication and multimedia design faculty of @entity11 's @entity70			2
to find out , visitors to the @entity26 in the @entity1 with a sense of the morbid are invited to lie in a series of four silver metal boxes similar to those found in a morgue			1

for about five minutes , visitors can relive the smells and sounds believed to have surrounded four people whose deaths are etched into the world 's collective memory : @entity17 ( 1963 ) ; @entity59 , @entity60 ( 1997 ) ; @entity61 ( 2011 ) and @entity19 ( 2012 )			1
for instance , those wanting to experience @entity19 's final moments are transported to a bathtub at the upmarket @entity21 hotel where the diva died in february 2012 at age 48			2
a coroner ruled the singer died of accidental drowning , with cocaine and heart disease listed as contributing factors			0
to the sounds of splashing water and @entity19 's voice , a visitor first gets a whiff of generic cleaner , used in hotels around the world , followed by the olive oil the singer used in her tub			1
then a strong chemical odour , similar to that of cocaine , fills the box , grabbing its occupant by the throat , followed by the sound of rushing water and then silence			2
' smell is rarely used in communication and we wanted to explore its uses , ' said mr @entity67			0
' it 's a very powerful means of communication			0
' visitors say the experience is ' quite surprising and spectacular , ' a soundtrack is played and different scents are released into the box to recreate a specific ' final moment ' during the five minute experience			1
scientists have proved smells are linked to the part of the brain that regulates emotion and memory			1
odours are often used in the retail industry to trigger a buying mood in customers			0
' who does n't want to buy a loaf after catching a whiff of fresh bread ? ' said mr @entity67 , who together with other lecturers and students has put together an inventory of odours and is devising new ways of using smell : for instance in storytelling			0
' it 's quite surprising and spectacular , ' said @entity155 , 31 , who experienced a recreation of @entity61 's last moments as the former @entity159 strongman was hunted and killed by rebels in october 2011			0

' you can watch the pictures as many times as you want - it 's just not the same thing , ' he said of the attack on @entity61 's convoy , forcing the long - serving leader to hide in a drainage pipe before being murdered			0
' i almost felt myself being hunted , ' said mr @entity155			0
in coming months , the installation will be taken across @entity29			2
' we 've conducted extensive research , ' said @entity206 , another lecturer at @entity70 about the authenticity of the experience			0
' there 's already a lot of information available on the internet , such as what perfume @entity14 or @entity17 were wearing , ' said mr @entity206			1
' @entity19 's autopsy report , for instance , is also available , ' he said			0
in coming months , the installation will be taken across @entity29			2
but the scientists admit battling to recreate the right scent for @entity14 's perfume , which is no longer made			1
' we had to rebuild something that resembled it as closely as possible , ' said scientist @entity223			0
the inventors of the ' final moments ' smells said in any case , exact historical accuracy was not their aim			0
rather , they wanted to explore new ways of ' smelling ' old stories .			0
