right , i 've polished my battle helmet , retrieved my columnist armour from the garage and positioned the ear plugs within easy distance			0
i 'm ready for the flash - flood of hysterical responses but here we go			1
breastfeeding : you do n't have to do it			1
it 's not just me saying it , this week a gp - yes , that 's right a medically qualified grown - up with two children of her own - said so too			1
you can give the newborn formula instead			0
@entity31 , i ca n't believe i wrote that			1
sirens must be going off all over the city			0
but really , i 'm telling you , you do n't have to do it - it 's not the law			1
i breastfed all four of mine so i 'm not flag - waving for the newly formed ' @entity39 ' group - i 'm not on one side or the other			1
i 'm just depressed that , 11 years after i first breastfed my eldest and two - and - a - bit years after i finished breastfeeding the youngest , the vitriolic war between those who do and those who do n't does nâ€™t appear to have abated			1
a new mum and journalist friend of mine wrote a piece at the weekend revealing she had stopped feeding her now ten - month - old at three weeks			1
the unpleasant , ignorant and frankly illogical abuse she got online ( and via the post ) left me dumbfounded			0
bottle feeding is fine : @entity20 thinks mums should n't feel guilty about it ( posed by model ) come on , team , we have got to get our act together on this soon			1
at a time when women are truly at our best ( when we 've just made another human forgoodnessnakes , as my son says ) we show ourselves at our worst			0
the acerbic and acidic response to my friend 's honest memoir of new motherhood baffles me			0
why are some breastfeeding enthusiasts so obnoxiously fanatical ? why are some bottle - feeding mums so ridiculously defensive ? where is that nutritious glow of support other women generally offer in almost any other circumstance ? why not nourish each other as we nourish our babies instead of justifying our choices and needs by rubbishing the women who make an alternative choice ? the relentless breastfeeding row is ' stupidy stupidy stupidy ' as my middle child is prone to say when you disagree with one of her more illogical schemes ( naked trampolining , the formation of the musical knicker ninjas , umbrellas indoors )			1
i had two fantastic breastfeeding experiences and two truly awful experiences			1
everyone has a different tale to tell so i wo n't bore you with mine except to say it 's peculiar how something so natural can feel so unnatural at times			1
of course , you 're free to ignore me because obviously i am not an expert on anything ( apart from doughnuts ) , but i feel the need to offer advice because i know that tonight , in the bleak small hours before sunlight rescues them , an army of exhausted new mums will hunch over howling newborns with their heads full of half - truths and tangled statistics , trying and failing to breastfeed			2
the dark depth of their misery will know no bounds , they 'll be tortured by failure and those incredibly precious moments they spend with their new child , which should be all velvety and soft , will be painful and pointless			0
after one such night i remember taking my still howling six - week - old for a walk as the world woke up , just to escape the scene of my disaster			2
the proportion of @entity126 mothers who breastfeed increased from 76 to 81 per cent between 2005 and 2010 a kind older woman stopped me in the street to ask if i was ok			2
' i 'm really struggling with the night feeds , ' i said apologetically			2
' give her a bottle , ' she said , ' just go home and do it now			2
or get your husband to give her one at midnight so you can sleep and not be too tired to feed later			2
' at no point had any of the midwives , breastfeeding counsellors or @entity142 experts said this			2
they just kept telling me i would get the hang of it soon			0
so i 'm saying to you what that lovely lady said to me			0
do it , give the baby a bottle now			0
do n't explain and do n't apologise			0
given you 'd step in front of an out - of - control car for your newborn , you can trust yourself to make the right decision			0
and hear this : at no point today do i ever look at my now happy , healthy , a-grade 11 - year - old and say : ' oh man , if i had n't given her that formula she 'd be at @entity164 by now			1
nor do i ever look at my seven - year - old son and say the reason he is a world champion hula hooper who never gets ill is because i breastfed him			0
@entity167 is editor - in - chief of @entity168 .			0

parenting guru dr @entity22 believes breastfeeding does n't always work
mother - of - four @entity20 agrees
she had two fantastic breastfeeding experiences and two awful ones
she thinks if mothers are struggling , they should n't be *afraid* to bottle feed
