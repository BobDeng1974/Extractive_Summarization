on the face of it , bubbly @entity0 is a 22 - year - old with a bright future ahead of her			1
a pretty and intelligent @entity5 , @entity6 is also a popular vlogger to boot			1
but @entity6 used to hide a dark secret : she was addicted to online pornography			1
and from the ages of 18 to 21 , she would lock herself in a dark room and watch adult movies endlessly			2
at her worst point , @entity6 would masturbate between five and six times a day - and watched a total of over 400 hours of adult material but now @entity6 has become a hero to other sufferers after bravely speaking out about her porn addiction on @entity33 - in a series that has amassed over 800,000 hits			1
@entity6 , from @entity36 , says , ' when i uploaded that video in february , i had no idea how phenomenal the response would be			1
' i received hundred of heartwarming comments from women who were going through the same thing for years			2
' lots of people do n’t think girls can suffer a porn addiction but it ’s a problem for both sexes			2
i hope i can help others out there - talking about your problem is the first step			2
' at her worst point , @entity6 ( in a still from one of her @entity33 videos ) would watch films for hours every day @entity6 , who began watching online pornography in 2006 , says that it was dangerously easy for her to access			1
she said : ' i was 14 years old when i went to find porn on the internet			1
it was out of curiosity and it was just a simple @entity67 search for me to get hold of an adult movie			2
' when i first watched it , my reaction was shock			2
but gradually over time , that shock becomes excitement and i would use any porn that i could get my hands on			2
' her habit started to become a worrying obsession by age 16 when she began watching adult movies as often as she could			1
she said : ' i was watching it so much that i started to get bored by the " normal " soft porn movies			1
' i was n't getting the buzz that i felt when i first saw it - in fact i was almost desensitised to that content			0
' i went from watching soft pornography to dodgier stuff to get the kick i needed			1
' @entity6 's addiction briefly stopped when she had a six - month relationship with a boy at age 18			1
but when she started university and found herself single again , the downward spiral of her addiction recommenced			2
she said : ' i was at a university and alone in a new city			0
i guess it was a trigger and i just went downhill from there			0
' for a period of two to three years , i was watching porn on a daily basis and sometimes masturbating over six times per day			1
it was all i could think about			0
' ' i did n't see people as people anymore - they were just sex objects to me , ' admitted @entity6 she continued : ' i did n't see people as people anymore - they were just sex objects to me			1
' the simplest things could set me off such as a girl unbuttoning her blouse or a boy taking his top off			0
everything made me want more			0
' i would sit in my room alone for hours , with the lights off , watching porn			1
i felt lonely and ashamed of myself			0
' when @entity6 turned 21 , she found @entity121 and knew it was time to confront her problem			1
she made several lifestyle changes so she would not return to old habits again			0
she says : ' i spoke to a friend about my addiction and that was a huge release for me			0
it was a first step			0
' talking about it made me realise how much of a problem it was - you 're only as sick as the secrets you keep			0
' as a @entity135 , you have to be quite controlled about what you let into your heart , in terms of what you see and do			0
' when @entity6 turned 21 , she found @entity121 and knew it was time to confront her problem			1
now she does n't read sex scenes in books and tries not to listen to oversexualised music she continued : ' so now , i do n’t read sex scenes in books and i do n’t listen to oversexualised music			0
' there are some artists that just sing about sex and it ’s best to avoid that , i also try to avoid inappropriate programmes on tv late at night			2
' as part of her recovery process , she posted a @entity33 video in february 2014 in which she revealed her porn addiction to the world			2
the response from viewers was overwhelmingly positive			0
she explains : ' when i read some of the comments on that video , it brings a tear to my eye			0
people have told me how alone they felt with their addiction until they saw my video			0
' @entity6 believes that there should be age restrictions on online pornography to make it less available to children			1
' it ’s heartbreaking to know that children can still access pornography so easily like i did			0
there are age restrictions on drinking and smoking - the same should go for porn			1
' a spokeperson for @entity189 said : ' the internet is having a huge impact on human sexuality as an infinite variety of material is available through picture sites , chat rooms , live shows , bulletin boards and web - cams			0
' internet sexual addiction is a form of sexual addiction and it is important to have someone to talk to about your feelings in general			0
