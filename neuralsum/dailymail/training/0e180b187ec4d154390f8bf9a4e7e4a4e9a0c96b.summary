from the intricate details of a bee 's mouth to the striking lines on the legs of a praying mantis , these incredible images reveal the stunning patterns that are hidden in the world around us			1
each image was taken using a new generation of microscope , dubbed @entity13 , which works like an automated ' point and shoot ' camera to instantly capture tiny details			1
the images were put together by @entity18 , who works for @entity19 in @entity20			1
pictured is a close up of lingual papillae which are the small , nipple or hair – like structures on the upper surface of the human tongue the series began when he took a bee 's leg to work after helping his daughter analyse it as part of her school science project			1
' my daughter and i observed the leg at home with her toy microscope , ' mr @entity18 said			1
' we spent a lot of quality time together moving it around and getting it in focus			0
' but when we were done , we had nothing more to take away than the memory of what the bee 's leg looked like			0
' in the lab , mr @entity18 used @entity13 to take a closer look			1
the device is designed to allow researchers to rapidly analyses samples such as insect limbs and cells			0
an ant 's head is on the left while on the right is a cross-section of bracken - a type of fern common in @entity65			2
the images were put together by @entity18 , who works for @entity19 in @entity20 the leg of a praying mantis			1
these creatures use their front legs to snare their prey with reflexes so quick that they are difficult to see a cross section of a pine needle can be seen on the left , while on the right is a mouse 's knuckle			2
the project began when mr @entity18 brought a bee 's leg to work after helping his daughter analyse it as part of her school science project the proboscis of a mosquito is seen in incredible detail in the image on the left			1
the proboscis contains two pairs of sharp , flexible cutters surrounding a pair of fine tubes			0
pictured on the right is the @entity13 machine the @entity13 uses five " preconfigured biological applications " that the company has branded @entity101			2
each app directs the system through differemt tasks and lab tests , allowing routine sample testing to be done in a few steps			0
' it allows [ scientists ] to simply set up very specific kinds of experiments and automatically receive data in the form of graphs , charts and reports to see if they worked , " mr @entity18 said			2
' it 's similar to the point - and - shoot camera , ' he added			1
' it helps take a lot of the microscopist out of getting the perfect shot			0

when mr @entity18 looked at his daughter 's sample in his lab with @entity13 , ' an amazingly detailed hairy leg popped right up on my computer screen , ' he said			1
for fun , he also imaged the leg in fluorescent light and saw that it was ' very auto - flourescent , ' and generated its own light			2
after the first leg , mr @entity18 imaged the rest of his daughter 's collection with the machine			2
after that , he acquired more school samples on @entity146 , sold by parents whose children had lost interest			0
' to me , these are hidden treasures which have led to some amazing images , ' he says			2
to date , mr @entity18 has taken over 2,000 pictures with @entity13 and assembled a ' best of ' list			1
' my wife turned a pair into canvas portraits to hang in our house , ' he says			0
he has since captured stunning images of everything from the hair – like structures on the upper surface of the human tongue to the alien like features of a mosquito head			1

these plants can grow 98 - 131 ft ( 30 - 40 metres )			2
mr @entity18 has now captured stunning images of everything from the hair – like structures on the upper surface of the human tongue to the alien like features of a mosquito head on the left is the bee leg that was first imaged using the system			1
on the right is @entity184 , also known as diatomite			0
it is a soft , siliceous sedimentary rock which is made up of fossilised remains of diatoms , a type of hard - shelled algae a bee 's mouth is pictured here			0
it shows the complex tools that the insect uses to eat and drink			0
most bees have paired mandibles , or jaws , that sit around a glossa , or tongue			0
the labrum and maxillae are like lips which support a proboscis , or tube for collecting nectar on the left is an image of the @entity210 glabratum plant , while on the right is an image of a corn stem			0
mr @entity18 acquired school samples on @entity146 , sold by parents whose children had lost interest pictured is a mosquito head , which is mostly eye			1
each of the eyes is made up of many tiny lenses that see a slightly different picture			0

the images were put together by @entity18 , who works for @entity19 in @entity20
each image was taken using a new microscope , dubbed @entity13 , that works like a point and shoot camera
*highlights* *include* the hair - like structure on a tongue , the legs of a praying mantis and the head of a mosquito
