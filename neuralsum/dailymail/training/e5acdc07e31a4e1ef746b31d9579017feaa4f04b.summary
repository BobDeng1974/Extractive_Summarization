by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:49 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 15:23 est , 14 october 2012 president @entity3 is set to launch an all - out assault on @entity5 in tuesday night 's debate , including attacks on the republican 's time at @entity10			1
he is desperate to pick up momentum and improve poll ratings after his first lackluster first debate when his @entity15 rival appeared more forceful , energetic and engaging than the president			0
and his campaign spokeswoman has hinted that @entity3 will use mr @entity5 's track record as an investment capitalist to hurt him			1
' governor @entity5 has been making pitches all of his life , ' @entity19 said			0
' he knows how to say what people want to hear whether that was during his time at @entity10 or during the dozens of town halls he did during the primary , ' she added , referring to the private equity firm that @entity5 used to run			1
a similar hint came from senior @entity3 campaign advisor @entity47 , who gave a clear hint that @entity5 's business experience may be used as a double - edged sword			1
' we expect governor @entity5 will have a great debate too , ' @entity47 said during an appearance on @entity54			2
' he is a great salesman			0
that is what he did as a professional , he is very good at it			0
' he said that president @entity3 was definitely going to be ' aggressive in making the case for his view of where we should go as a country			1
' after being roundly criticized for his performance in the last debate , mr @entity3 is apparently well aware that a change needs to be made			2
down to business : @entity5 , seen with his wife @entity68 , spent the weekend in their @entity70 home preparing for the debate tuesday night sticking to the schedule : @entity5 and @entity74 were seen leaving their church sunday morning ' he knew when he walked off that stage ( of the first debate ) , and he also knew as he watched the tape of that debate , that he has to be more energetic , ' campaign adviser @entity77 said to @entity83 's @entity82			1
both @entity3 and @entity5 are skipping campaigning sunday to focus on preparing for their debate tuesday night , with the incumbent trying to rebound from a widely panned performance at the first face - off and the @entity15 nominee hoping to repeat his strong showing			1
senator @entity91 , who has been playing the role of the president during @entity5 's debate prep , said that they are taking a shift in energy levels into account			1
' i think president @entity3 is going to come out swinging , ' @entity91 told @entity102 's @entity101			1
' he 's going to compensate for a poor first debate			0
and i think that will be consistent with what they 've been doing this whole campaign , which is running a highly negative ad campaign			0
they 've spent hundreds of millions around the country , including a lot in @entity112 , mischaracterizing governor @entity5 's positions and misrepresenting him			0
i think you 'll see that again on tuesday night			0
' the president was gathering with advisers at a riverfront resort in @entity33 while @entity5 was sticking to his @entity119 - area home ahead of the prime - time town - hall style debate at @entity122 exactly three weeks before the november 6 election			1
prepping : the president was gathering with advisers at a riverfront resort in @entity33 , @entity34 staying local : @entity5 was sticking to his @entity119 - area home ahead of the prime - time town - hall style debate after a listless first debate october 3 , @entity3 was working with aides on more pointed and aggressive responses to his @entity15 rival in the tight race			1
the @entity3 campaign also wants to go after the former @entity70 governor and businessman for what it sees as his willingness to shift positions to make them more palatable for voters			2
@entity5 will be ready for a more aggressive @entity3 , adviser @entity142 said			1
' the president can change his style , he can change his tactics , he ca n't change his record and he ca n't change his policies			2
and that 's what this election is about , ' @entity142 told @entity83 's @entity82			0
@entity5 's campaign released a new television advertisement using footage from running mate @entity155 's debate last week with vice president @entity156			1
round one : @entity5 was deemed the winner of the first debate as the president was criticized for being too quiet and seemingly uninterested sparring : thursday saw the first and only vice presidential debate between @entity5 's running mate @entity155 ( left ) and vice president @entity156 ( right ) the ad features clips of @entity155 saying the government ' ca n't keep spending money we do n't have			1
' his comments are juxtaposed with video from the debate of @entity156 laughing			0
the campaign did not say in which states the ad would run			0
@entity3 aides have tried to make debate preparations a higher priority for the president this time			1
ahead of first debate , some of @entity3 's practice sessions were cut short , and others were canceled , mainly because of developments in @entity181 , where four @entity182 were killed at a @entity182 consulate			2
aides say @entity3 is still dealing with those matters and others			0
but the urgency that led to interruptions during earlier debate preparations has subsided , and the campaign is trying to ensure that @entity3 stays more fully engaged in his practice sessions			2
despite questions about the effectiveness of his debate preparation , @entity3 is working with the same team this time around			1
advisers @entity47 and @entity197 , along with former @entity199 officials @entity200 and @entity201 , are running the preparations			0
deputy national security adviser @entity203 has been added to the team because the second and third debates involve foreign policy			0
senator @entity207 is playing the role of @entity5			0
one of the priorities during the practice sessions is sharpening the president 's retorts to @entity5 and drawing a sharper contrast between what the campaign says are @entity5 's shifting positions on key issues			2
taking to the streets : the pressure is now on mr @entity5 , seen here with a crowd in @entity222 , @entity112 on saturday , for him to repeat the energetic and victorious performance that he had in the last debate greeting the fans : president @entity3 's decision to take days off from campaigning shows how serious he intends to focus on preparation for the second debate the president may have picked up a few pointers from @entity156			1
@entity3 watched thursday 's debate with aides in a conference room on @entity234 as he traveled back to @entity235			2
the president said little throughout the debate , but did chime in when @entity156 would deliver a particularly pointed counter to @entity155			0
@entity5 returned to @entity70 on saturday night after campaigning in @entity112			0
he planned to spend most of his two days at home in @entity240 getting ready for the debate			0
with @entity5 is @entity112 senator @entity91 , who 's playing @entity3 in mock debates .			2

president @entity3 and @entity5 both take time off from campaign trail to prepare for town hall - style debate on tuesday
@entity5 won last debate and @entity3 did n't mention @entity10 once even though his team has talked about the private equity firm *extensively*
