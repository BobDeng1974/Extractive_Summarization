by @entity0 the opening weekend of the @entity2 season concludes with a @entity4 double bill as the @entity5 entertain the @entity6 at @entity7 before the @entity8 visit the @entity9			1
@entity6 at @entity5 the @entity10 - bound @entity5 will be hoping they can finally win the @entity11			1
last season , @entity5 were in pole position to clinch the division , only to lose their final four games and miss out			1
the addition of @entity17 in free agency gives the @entity5 a legitimate target to go with of star wideout @entity20			1
outside of @entity20 , either a running back or tight end has posted the next highest total of receiving yards for the last four seasons ( @entity25 , 547 yards in 2013 , @entity26 567 in yards 2012 , 777 yards in 2011 and 722 yards in 2010 )			0
a potent passing game is complemented by the backfield duo of @entity29 and @entity25 , who combined for 1656 rushing yards as well as 1053 receiving			0
come in no 2 : @entity17 ( left ) will add a much - needed alternative to the majestic @entity20 questions remain over the secondary , with the passing defence surrendering an average of 246 yards per game			1
any short comings in the secondary could be masked by the guys on the line			2
both @entity42 and @entity43 have the talent to dominate , but either are prone to imploding mentally			0
second year defensive end @entity46 is one to watch throughout the season , as the @entity5 look to improve on their pass rush			1
the @entity6 bolstered their defense during the off - season with the addition of cornerbacks @entity53 and @entity54 , along with a fully fit @entity55			1
@entity58 will be looking to put behind him the struggles of last season , during which he threw a league leading 27 interceptions			1
following the retirement of @entity64 , new offensive coordinator @entity65 , will look to reinvigorate @entity58			2
however @entity58 has struggled to grasp @entity65 's system after several poor performances during pre-season			2
running back @entity69 was forced to retire during the off - season , and new addition @entity71 is expected to carry the load , complemented by fourth round draft pick @entity74 , who 's caught the eye with some stout performances during pre-season			2
@entity8 at @entity9 on a career upsurge : @entity80 @entity8 quarterback @entity80 enjoyed a career season last year in regards to his completion percentage			1
his 69.5 % completion rate , tops his prior career best of 66 % which came back in 2010			0
add to that the 32 touchdown passes thrown , which was @entity89 ' highest total since the 2008 season ( 34 ) and for those keeping track his interception total also fell , down by four to 11 ( lowest total since 2009 )			0
@entity92 was sensational last season , posting 1046 yards and eight touchdowns			0
hype seems to building around young tight end @entity96			0
combine all that with the splash play ability of @entity99 , the evergreen @entity100 along with the backfield of @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 and the @entity8 possess a deceptively explosive offense			1
defensive improvements have been made via the draft , with the addition of first round pick cornerback @entity109 , as the @entity8 look to bolster a passing defense that short changed star safety @entity111 , giving up an average of 257.8 yards per game			2
the return of linebacker @entity115 following a torn @entity116 is another huge boost for the defensive unit			0
the @entity9 have been hit by a mixture of injury and free agency losses within this talented defense , resulting in many people believing that the team is set to decline in 2014 , that would be foolish in my eyes , as the @entity9 made a couple of stout moves by acquiring both corner back @entity130 and left tackle @entity131 via free agency			0
with one of the games premier shutdown corners @entity135 and the return of @entity137 from an season ending injury the cards possess an excellent secondary			2
offensively , @entity142 is a solid veteran who has the potential to take the team to the play - offs			1
bold statement i know but consider the weapons at his disposal , @entity150 has looked like @entity155 during the pre-season , fellow wideout @entity149 is set for a breakout season , @entity146 a second round pick in this year â€™s draft is an excellent blocker and could prove to a vital outlet for @entity142			1
another rookie to watch this season is the third round pick @entity163 out of @entity164 , his blazing speed gives the team not only a legitimate deep threat but an excellent weapon in the return game			0
to have your say on the @entity2 , listen to the @entity173 's live call in show on sundays from 4pm			0

@entity5 , who should have won the @entity11 last season , have added @entity155 - winner @entity17 to an explosive offense
but concerns remain about a *suspect* secondary , which could be *exploited* by @entity58
the @entity8 are a potential dark horse this season after reaching the play - offs last time out
@entity189 , who were *unlucky* to miss out on the *postseason* after going 10 - 6 , have been hit by a raft of injuries and suspensions
