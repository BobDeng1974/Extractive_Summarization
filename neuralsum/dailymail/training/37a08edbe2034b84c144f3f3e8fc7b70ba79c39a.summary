@entity0 said customers will not make enough savings to foot the cost of new meters being rolled out in the next five years families could end up forking out more for smart energy meters than they will save , mps have suggested			1
the @entity7 said the average cost of installing 53million of the devices over five years could amount to £ 215 per household , or £ 43 a year , with the expense added to bills			1
but over the same period , households can expect to shave only around £ 26 a year off their bills , the @entity4 said			1
the government claims families will reduce how much they spend on gas and electricity they use because they will be able to monitor their usage			1
but mps on the @entity7 have questioned whether the high specification devices , which will include displays to demonstrate gas and electricity usage and costs , will be good value of money			1
the government and energy industry have decided that all homes and small businesses should have meters installed by 2020			2
ministers have backed the plan as part of a wider strategy to cut household energy use and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet @entity41 targets			1
the devices will deliver massive savings to energy companies because the meters allow them to get accurate energy use readings automatically , which means they can rid of thousands of meter readers , billing and customer service staff			1
it will also allow the energy firms to introduce new variable tariffs that impose much higher charges during the peak evening period in order to encourage families to switch energy use to other times of the day			2
the government claims that families who can better see how they use energy and how much it costs will reduce the amount of gas and electricity they use			1
but @entity0 , chairman of the committee , warned : ‘ it will cost around £ 215 per home or small business over the next five years to install the meters			1
' despite consumers footing the bill , they can on average make a saving of only 2 per cent on the average annual bill of £ 1,328 by the time the roll out is complete			1
even this is conditional on consumers changing their behaviour and cutting their energy use			0
' the @entity80 is relying on the consumer becoming more “ savvy ” in making decisions about using energy			0
’ even this claimed saving is questionable , for some research carried out by @entity88 academics suggests any reduction is likely to be short - lived before people return to their old habits			2
mps also warned that some features of the new meters could be obsolete before they are installed , such as the home display monitor showing energy use			0
mps on the @entity7 have questioned whether the high specification devices , which will include displays to demonstrate gas and electricity usage and costs , will be good value of money ( posed by model ) the committee pointed out that it would be far cheaper to send this information to homes via a smartphone app. the government ’s @entity80 ( @entity80 ) is relying heavily on competition among the energy companies to keep the price of installing the meters down			1
however , miss @entity0 warned : ‘ relying on market forces to keep costs down may not be enough on its own to protect consumers			0
this is something energy companies do n’t have a great track record on			0
’ she said the companies also need to provide clear information to customers on the costs of installing the meters , how much they will save by stopping meter readings and how much energy is being saved as a result of the new regime			1
sharing her concerns about whether the meter technology being installed will be obsolete , miss @entity0 said : ‘ some aspects of the programme could be out - of - date by the time it is rolled out			0
‘ evolving technology suggests that customers could receive the information on their smart phones , making the in - home display redundant			2
‘ energy suppliers will be required to offer in - home displays , even though customers may not want or use them			0
consumers will have to pay for them even though they might already be out of date			0
‘ @entity145 must monitor progress , costs and benefits during roll - out to identify whether changes are needed to secure the delivery of smart meters at minimum cost to consumers			2
’ energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			0
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			2
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			2
remember , suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
do n't forget , prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

average cost of installing 53m devices could amount to £ 215 per household
over five years , this is £ 43 a year - but savings on bills could only be £ 26
government say devices will see families reduce spend on gas and electricity
but some @entity4 say it would be cheaper to send information via phone app
