this three - year - old already knows the importance of budgeting			0
adorable @entity2 is clearly anxious of over the loss of her money and is set to get to the bottom of the mystery of her missing dollars			1
the questioning - shown on a video uploaded to @entity10 by her father - starts with her dad asking her just how much her mother had spent shopping and what was it she bought			1
‘ how much did mummy spend ? ’ he asks			0
the child is certain of the amount , saying ‘ $ 80 , ’ but only holds up four fingers			0
‘ i did not ! ’ a voice says from the background , just as the child reiterates her statement , claiming that her mother had used a credit card to spend the money			1
but she quickly corrects herself , telling her father : ‘ she used your dollars			2
’ her face is serious as she tries to convey the severity of the situation to her clearly amused father , who fights to contain his giggles			0
‘ what did she buy ? ’ the father questions			0
adorable three - year - old @entity2 first blames her mother , and then her father , for taking her money ‘ she bought a “ frozen ” and a playdough , ' the girl says in the four - minute clip , punching the air to stress her point			1
but unbeknownst to her , she ’s walked right into a trap as her father ’s next question has her confused			0
‘ now why would she buy that ? ’ he asks			0
but @entity2 turns away and in a barely audible whisper says , ‘ i wanted playdough ’			2
her father pursues the subject , ‘ did you have money ? did you buy the playdough ? then why did you ask for it if you do n’t have the money ? ’ she wanted ' playdough ' : @entity2 's story changes and she stumbles at one point as she weaves her tangled tale ‘ i have money , ’ she says , certain of her financial independence			1
and in a swift move , @entity2 turns the tables neatly and her father now finds himself at the end of a barrage of accusations			1
‘ you took my money , ’ she says			0
he ’s shocked at being dragged into the blame game and denies taking her cash but @entity2 is not interested in his side of the story			1
the three - year - old seems quite sure of the exact time and place the incident occurs and continues to eloquently explain just what happened and how much money was pilfered			2
‘ you take my money to your work , when you ’re going to work , you take my money ’ , she says in her endearingly lilting tones			0
she is certain that her father spent ‘ $ 20 of my money ’ and swiftly becomes the inquisitor , asking , ‘ why , why did you take my money ? ’ @entity2 is convinced that her father owes her ' twenty - eighty - nine dollars			1
' the eloquentlittle girl spends nearly four minutes trying to get to the bottom of the mystery of her missing dollars ‘ i want my money back , ’ she beseeches			1
‘ is it in your pocket ? did you leave it in the store ? ’ ‘ i did n’t take your money , ’ her father says , but to no avail as @entity2 is convinced he now has her cash			1
‘ how much does @entity98 owe you ? ’ her mother asks			0
’ twenty - eighty - nine dollars , ’ @entity2 says , as both her parents try to stop themselves from laughing out loud			1
they quickly change the subject , asking the child what was purchased with the precious dollars			2
‘ i bought eat and then i went to the store and then i bought a whole bag of frozen , ’ she rambles on			0
‘ why would you buy a whole bag of frozen stuff , ? ’ her father asks			0
disconcerted by this line of questioning , @entity2 is at a loss for words and stumbles on her sentences as she tries to clear her thoughts and explain to her father just what happened			2
she quickly gains her composure , saying , ‘ you took my money , i did n’t take your money , you did ’ and goes on to explain what was bought and how much was spent			0
‘ it ’s not true , @entity2 ’ her mother admonishes as the little girl ’s story gets more and more tangled			2
‘ you guys spent $ 28 on toys ? ’ the father asks in mock disbelief as @entity2 ’s mother is heard protesting in the background			1
‘ @entity131 bought your medicine because you were sick and then we went to eat breakfast , ’ the mother says , clarifying just what happened			0
‘ you ’re something else ! ’ @entity2 says , pointing at her mother			2
‘ you ’re taking all my money ! ’ ‘ i am not something else , i am your mother ! ’ her mum says , just as the father is unable to control himself any longer and starts laughing .			1
