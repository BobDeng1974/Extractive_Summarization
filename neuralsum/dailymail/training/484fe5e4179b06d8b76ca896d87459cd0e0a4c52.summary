@entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 province , has such a large neck tumour that his neck has grown to be almost as wide as his shoulders mr @entity9 believes his problems started when he was involved in an accident in 2005 he spent time in hospital and he received a course of hormone therapy			1
from that point onwards , his neck started to grow thicker and thicker and he has now been diagnosed with lipoma – a benign tumour			1
however , while the tumour is benign , it has recently started to spread around his body and it is now affecting his back , legs , arms and stomach			0
therefore , he desperately needs surgery to remove the tumour but his family is too poor to pay for the procedure			0
a lipoma is a soft , fatty lump that grows under the skin , normally on the shoulders , neck , chest , arms or back			0
while the tumour is benign , it has recently started to spread around his body and it is now affecting his back , legs , arms and stomach he desperately needs surgery to remove the tumour but his family is too poor to pay for the procedure the non-cancerous tumours which affect one in a hundred people are harmless and can often be left alone			2
however , lipomas need to be removed if they are causing discomfort or if they are particularly large , like mr @entity9 ’s			0
they are normally only between one and three centimetres in diameter and are caused by an overgrowth of fat cells .			2
