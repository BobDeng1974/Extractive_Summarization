by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 8 july 2013 the @entity3 opening ceremony took place under threat of a cyber attack , security experts have revealed			1
nearly a year on , @entity7 , head of cyber security for the @entity9 , has told how officials feared the @entity12 lights could be switched off by a remote attack			1
he was telephoned by @entity15 intelligence agency @entity14 in the early hours of july 27 , the day of the £ 27million opening ceremony with the warning			1
the @entity18 and @entity19 , left , were one of the many highlights of the £ 27million ceremony , which went off without a hitch despite threats that the @entity12 could face a cyber attack the threat was discovered by @entity14 only hours before the ceremony began on july 27 last year the threat failed to materialise , but security officials have now revealed the extent of the precautions they took to make sure the celebrations went off without a hitch			1
' there was a suggestion that there was a credible attack on the electricity infrastructure supporting the @entity38 , ' mr @entity7 told a @entity40 programme , which will be broadcast this evening			1
' and the first reaction to that is , " @entity44 , you know , let 's make a strong cup of coffee and get into the office "			0
' mr @entity7 said that extensive testing took place in anticipation of a wide range of attacks , including the exact scenario that raised concerns at @entity14			2
he said : ' we 'd tested no less than five times the possibility of an attack , a cyber attack , on the electricity infrastructure			2
' in a sense i think we felt pretty well prepared , but there 's always an amount of concern , particularly when you 've only got eight or nine hours before the opening ceremony			2
' the government , @entity3 organiser @entity68 and service providers such as @entity70 were all part of a team that responded to such threats			0
the primary response to the threat came from the @entity76 , based at @entity78 headquarters in @entity79			2
@entity80 leading @entity82 's athletes out during the opening ceremony on july 27 last year			1
the head of cyber security for the @entity38 said there was enough back - up to keep the stadium alight no matter what this involved assessing how credible the threat of attack might be , a process which took place while officials put in place a contingency plan			1
' the clock was absolutely ticking , ' mr @entity7 told the @entity40			2
' we effectively switched to manual , or had the facility to switch to manual			0
' it 's a very crude way of describing it , but effectively we had lots of technicians stationed at various points			0
' he said there was so much back - up in place that ' if all the lights went out in east @entity114 you could guarantee that the @entity12 would still be burning brightly '			0
in the afternoon before the ceremony , a @entity116 meeting discussed contingency plans and ministers were informed of the issues			0
a @entity40 programme will reveal the fears for the first time tonight but officials became increasingly confident that they could deal with the threat if it happened			1
an hour before the ceremony , a colleague told mr @entity7 : ' if the lights go down we can get them up and running regardless within 30 seconds '			0
' thirty seconds at the opening ceremony with the lights going down would have been catastrophic in terms of reputational hit , ' mr @entity7 said			0
' so i watched the opening ceremony with a great deal of trepidation			0
' the attack failed to materialise , but mr @entity7 said he twitched every time the lights in the stadium dimmed as he watched the ceremony at home with his family , who were unaware of the threat			1
he said : ' you would n't be human if you did n't have butterflies			0

@entity14 found out about the threat only hours ahead of july 27 ceremony
@entity9 head of cyber security speaks about fears to @entity40
under attack - the threat from @entity158 , is broadcast on @entity40 today at *8pm*
