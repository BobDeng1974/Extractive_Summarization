@entity0 today hailed a proposal by president @entity2 to boost spending for the @entity5 space agency by 2.9 per cent			1
the agency 's administrator , @entity6 , said this will help @entity0 make strides in the journey toward @entity11 , where a human mission is planned for the 2030s			1
however , @entity0 could be axing its long - lived @entity11 rover opportunity mission in 2016 after there were no allocated funds in the @entity18 's fiscal year budget request			1
the $ 18.5 billion budget request , also includes funding for developing a mission to @entity36 's @entity35 , and the agency 's asteroid redirect mission ( @entity39 )			1
although @entity2 's overall $ 4 trillion @entity5 budget plan faces an uphill climb through @entity43 - controlled @entity42 , support for the space agency tends to reach across bipartisan lines			2
' president @entity2 is proposing a fiscal year 2016 budget of $ 18.5 billion dollars for @entity0 , building on the significant investments the administration has made in @entity5 's space program over the past six years , ' @entity46 said			1
@entity0 could be axing its long - lived @entity11 rover opportunity mission in 2016 after there were no allocated funds in the @entity18 's fiscal year budget request the $ 18.5 billion budget request , also includes funding for developing a mission to @entity36 's @entity35 ( pictured ) , and the agency 's asteroid redirect mission the proposed @entity0 budget is up 2.9 per cent			1
the exploration budget — which includes @entity0 's plans to grab either an asteroid or a chunk of an asteroid and haul it closer to @entity67 for exploration by astronauts — gets a slight bump in funding			1
but the details within the overall exploration proposal are key			0
the @entity2 plan would put more money into cutting - edge non-rocket space technology ; give a 54 per cent spending jump to money sent to private firms to develop ships to taxi astronauts to the @entity82 ; and cut by nearly 12 per cent spending to build the next government big rocket and capsule to carry astronauts			0
@entity42 in the past has cut the president 's proposed spending on the private firms and technology and boosted the spending on the government big rocket and capsule			0
the president 's 0.8 per cent proposed increase in @entity0 science spending is his first proposed jump in that category in four years			2
it 's also the first proposed jump in years in exploring other planets			0
it includes extra money for a 2020 unmanned @entity11 rover and continued funding for an eventual robotic mission to @entity36 's @entity35			1
but the biggest extra science spending goes to study @entity67			0
@entity2 's budget would cut aeronautics research 12 per cent from current spending and slash @entity0 's educational spending by 25 per cent			1
it also slightly trims the annual spending to build the over-budget multi-billion dollar @entity114 , which will eventually replace the @entity115 and is scheduled to launch in 2018			0
' that 's a half - billion - dollar increase over last year 's enacted budget , and it is a clear vote of confidence in you - the employees of @entity0 - and the ambitious exploration program you are executing			1
' @entity46 said key areas of focus for @entity0 are continuing to prepare a manned mission to @entity11 , as well as developing advanced solar electric propulsion systems needed for an asteroid redirect mission			1
' we have identified several asteroids that could be good candidates and will make a decision soon on a capture option			0
' @entity46 also touched on a new mission in the works for @entity36 , but gave few details			0
' looking to the future , we 're planning a mission to explore @entity36 's fascinating moon @entity139 , selecting instruments this spring and moving toward the next phase of our work			2
' in 2011 , @entity0 sent a billion - dollar solar - powered spacecraft called @entity145 on a five - year journey to @entity36			1
@entity145 , which should arrive in july 2016 , was launched just over two weeks after the final space shuttle mission returned to @entity67 and the 30 - year program was shuttered for good			2
the @entity149 already has an unmanned spacecraft in the works to explore @entity36 's icy moons , including @entity139			0
the @entity153 , or @entity153 , will be launched in 2022 , arriving at @entity36 in 2030 for a mission lasting three years			0
the proposed @entity0 budget is up 2.9 per cent			1

@entity0 said that axing opportunity was not yet set in stone and they have yet to make a decision on the rover			2

$ 18.5 billion budget request for @entity0 is 2.9 per cent up from last year
@entity0 administrator , @entity6 , said agency was on path to @entity11
funding is also included for developing a mission to the @entity35
@entity0 is focusing some *resources* on a future asteroid redirect mission
there is no funding for @entity226 or the @entity29
