crime gangs from @entity2 are operating here with ' impunity ' due to @entity6 free movement rules , a disturbing report warns today the @entity35 report , written by a former senior aide to home secretary @entity37 , is based on interviews with senior police and officials in @entity9 and overseas			1
it offers a deeply disturbing insight into how , since the @entity6 expanded to include former @entity45 members in 2004 , a huge market has opened up in what it calls the ' modern slave trade '			1
in the past , trafficking gangs had to bring in migrants from outside the @entity6 – which meant they would need to pass through border controls			2
but they are now able to target people in impoverished communities in @entity13 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 with open access to @entity9			1
migrants are duped into believing they are travelling to the @entity9 for work and enter the country legally under the @entity6 's @entity63			1
the traffickers then seize control of their bank accounts and travel documents , and force them to work in often gruesome conditions			2
the report , written by former @entity72 special adviser @entity71 , says : ' one of the most serious unintended consequences of free movement in the @entity6 is that it has made it much easier for organised criminal gangs to operate their cross-border business models with impunity and without fear of being detected and therefore pursued			1
' significantly , the report has the backing of mrs may , who has written the foreword			2
she has been one of the cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on @entity6 free movement – including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of @entity9			1

@entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 are identified as hotspots – with @entity110 targeted so the victims can marry at a younger age			0
shockingly , the report found girls were sold to ' customers ' for pregnancy so the buyer could claim he had an article 8 right to a family life in the @entity9			1
@entity121 , the @entity6 's crime fighting agency , has identified particular problems with children being brought into the @entity9 from @entity13			1
voters want the @entity127 to be far tougher on mass immigration , a major survey revealed last night			0
barely one in ten @entity9 say they are satisfied with @entity130 ’s border policies			1
the poll by @entity132 suggests this unhappiness may explain why large numbers of conservatives are switching to @entity136			0
the findings will heap pressure on the prime minister to end his silence on immigration during the election campaign			0
he has not mentioned his party ’s manifesto pledges to curb @entity6 free movement , deport more illegals and tag foreign criminals			1
yet a large proportion of voters believe politicians are talking too little about migration			0
blow for @entity130 : a new @entity132 survey reveals the huge levels of dissatisfaction with the government 's handing of immigration , especially among former @entity160 supporters who now plan to vote @entity136 major issue : just 12 per cent of all voters are satisfied with the handling of immigration , falling to just 1 per cent of @entity136 supporters			2

' action : mr @entity130 has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by @entity6 nationals @entity56 and @entity186 were also identified as countries from which criminal gangs are trafficking women for sex			2
women who are brought to the @entity9 and forced to work in the sex industry are often moved from city to city , with their services advertised online			1
one website featured 1,000 women based in @entity198			0
the report calls on the @entity6 to implement a new system of passenger name records so there is a better chance of tracking people smugglers and their victims who travel by air			2
but this is being blocked by the @entity6 on privacy grounds			0
it would also alert the authorities if a suspected people smuggler was headed towards the @entity9 with a child			1
the report says : ' exploiting the internet and borders made less defined due to @entity6 policies like free movement , organised crime groups find the trafficking of victims a highly lucrative and accessible crime			1
' the @entity72 has estimated that , in any given year , there are between 10,000 and 13,000 victims of human trafficking in the @entity9			1
in the last @entity224 , the @entity127 passed @entity2 's first @entity225			1
traffickers involved in the most serious cases now face possible life sentences			0

@entity9 benefits scam builds a @entity13 village by @entity238 , @entity239 correspondent for the @entity240 a crime gang from @entity13 duped unsuspecting families into travelling to the @entity9 so they could scam hundreds of thousands of pounds in benefits – and send the cash back to a village known as ' @entity247 '			1
the profits were funnelled to the 1,000 - year - old village of @entity250 in the @entity252 district of @entity13 where they were used to build houses			0
the homes are partly funded by the @entity9 taxpayer and local residents have nicknamed them ' @entity258 ' after the chocolate sweets because the houses are painted brightly and in different colours			1
@entity262 : a house in so - called @entity247 , where a crime gang funnelled profits from a benefits scam			0
homes in the 1,000 - year - old village , such as the one pictured above , are partly funded by the @entity9 taxpayer when the gang feared @entity9 officials might become suspicious , they changed tactics – sending the migrants to @entity275 instead to claim asylum and state support there			2
the victims , expecting to work legally , had been transported to @entity9 in coaches			2
but once they were across the border , the criminals seized their passports and other documents and forced them into domestic servitude , slave labour and welfare fraud – signing up for several state handouts including tax credits			0
gang members arranged housing and took their victims to open high street bank accounts using a ' translator ' who was also in on the lucrative scam			0
benefits were then paid into accounts in the names of the victims but controlled by the traffickers			0
scam : three @entity303 crooks , including @entity304 , pictured , raked in £ 1.2million by bringing ' fake mothers ' to @entity9 to claim benefits falsely the sums of money made by the @entity2 from trafficking victims using this kind of exploitation were huge			1

the family splashed the vast amounts of cash they pocketed on a life of luxury , gambling in casinos and going on spending sprees to buy gold and diamonds			0
the crooks – @entity304 , her husband @entity329 , and brother @entity330 – pulled off one of the largest welfare scams of its kind from a terraced house in @entity335 , @entity176			0
up to 50 women were brought to @entity9 under freedom of movement rules and groomed to claim falsely that they were working for a temp agency on low wages so they could receive tax credits			1
after the gang had exploited the identities of the women , they allowed them to return to @entity13 , retaining control of their bank accounts , passports , national insurance cards and birth certificates			0
@entity304 – who never worked a day after arriving in @entity9 – kept around £ 30,000 in cash at their headquarters in nearby @entity353			2
at least £ 60,000 in stolen benefits were transferred back home			0
but the scam was finally exposed when the criminals began using a high street stationer 's receipt books to write bogus payslips for the women			0
@entity363 inspectors noticed they were using the same employee number on all the slips			0
in november 2011 , at @entity367 the gang were jailed for tax credit fraud and money laundering			0
@entity304 was sentenced to four - and - a - half years , while @entity370 was given three - and - a - half years and @entity330 three years			0
