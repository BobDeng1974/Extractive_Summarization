by @entity0 a skin cancer warning has been sounded following evidence some big brand sun creams do not offer the protection they claim to give			1
as temperatures are predicted to hit the mid- 70s this weekend , products by @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 have been given a ‘ do n’t buy ’ rating by independent reviewer which ?			1
the consumer champion tested 15 popular sun creams that claimed to have a @entity15 ( @entity15 ) of 30 , as well as helping to shield the skin from @entity18 rays			1
the end for lotion ? the new drinkable liquid offers up to factor 30 protection the three which failed were found to have a real @entity15 level of less than 25 , while the @entity7 product also fell short of the required @entity18 standard			1
sun exposure is linked to premature ageing and skin cancer , with evidence of 100,000 cases being diagnosed in the @entity32 each year			2
which ? found that paying a high price is no guarantee of better protection , with the most expensive brand outperformed by a cheap rival			1
@entity39 , which failed the @entity15 test , was the most expensive cream tested , at £ 11.30 per 100ml			1
@entity42 , which was £ 1.20 per 100ml , passed both tests			2
which ? executive director @entity44 said : ‘ we ’ve found three products that failed the strict @entity48 tests and we want to see manufacturers doing much more to make sure their sun creams live up to the claims on the packaging			1
’ all the companies behind the brands criticised by which ? insist the products meet the protection levels claimed on the packs			1
researchers tested the creams on ten volunteers , who had the same amount of each product applied to a small area of their back before lying under a lamp to replicate the sun ’s rays			1
their skin was checked for redness and compared to the results of a lamp test with no cream			2
to test the suncream which ? apply a small amount to an area on a person 's back before a special lamp is shone on the patch and a lab assistant checks for redness @entity15 is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from @entity84 rays than someone wearing no cream			2
if the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes , for example , a person wearing @entity88 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer – 150 minutes			1
while @entity84 rays are behind the redness of sunburn , @entity18 rays damage the skin ’s dna at a deeper layer			0
both radiation types can cause skin cancer			0
the @entity102 recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a uva protection factor that is a third of their spf			2
the @entity7 product failed to meet this standard			1
the @entity108 advises applying 35ml of sun cream			2
that equates to seven teaspoons – one for the head and neck , one for each arm and leg , and one each for the chest and back			0
it suggests users re-apply every two hours			0
which ? said : ‘ a sunscreen that does n’t offer the protection it claims could expose you to a greater risk of developing sunburn than one that meets its claim , as you will be getting less protection than you think			2
’ @entity7 said : ‘ we stand by our testing … we have nothing to hide			1
’ @entity8 said all of its products are assessed in compliance with @entity102 regulations and that it is confident its products provide the protection stated			1
@entity9 said it only sells products that meet the @entity15 figure claimed on the pack			1
temperatures are expected to reach a sweltering @entity146 ( @entity147 ) this weekend			0
pictured : @entity148 , @entity149 as summer arrives at last , nature is waking up to celebrate			0
the glorious weather expected this weekend comes after a mild and wet winter that has provided perfect conditions for plants and wildlife to thrive			0
as a result , many species are stirring earlier than expected			0
elderflowers are in flower , dog roses are blooming and hawthorn is at a peak – a situation not usually seen until june			0
far more butterflies have also hatched than would usually be seen at this time of year			0
most of @entity32 will be bathed in sunshine at the weekend as the mercury hits its record for the year			0
there will be barely a cloud in the sky for long spells as temperatures reach a sweltering @entity146 ( @entity147 ) , warmer than many parts of the @entity175 and much hotter than the @entity177 ( 61f ) average for may			0
the hot spell will last until monday but will break before the @entity179 starts on tuesday , with unsettled weather expected for much of next week			0
@entity182 naturalist @entity181 said : ‘ it ’s an early summer because of the mild , wet and stormy winter , and the whole thing ’s rather jumped the gun			0
’ he added : ‘ if the jet stream is kind to us , it could be a really wonderful summer			0
