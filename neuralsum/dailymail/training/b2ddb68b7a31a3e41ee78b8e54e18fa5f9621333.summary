by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 9 september 2013 running out of battery on your phone at the most crucial moment is a pain			0
but even worse is having to carry around a bulky spare battery twice the size of your slim and lightweight smartphone in case this happens			0
but now an inventor from @entity13 has come up with a solution by developing a credit - card sized device that allows you to wirelessly charge your phone on the move			1
to power your phone , you simply stick a charged @entity20 device to the back of it ‘ in order to keep up with the pace of modern power consumption , many resort to carrying additional power packs in an effort to remain connected in this wireless world , ’ said creator @entity28			1
‘ portable charging in this manner seems like the stone age , especially when wireless charging and ultra-thin lithium polymer batteries are already a reality			0
’ the @entity20 device uses an inductive coil in charging circuitry that fits into packaging that is 72mm x 55mm x 5.5mm			1
the system is made up of a receiver and a transmitter			2
the receiver will stick or get fitted on the back of your mobile phone and plugs into a micro usb port			1
the transmitter will contain a @entity54 lithium polymer battery			0
the receiver is shown on the left and wireless charger on the right			2
it wo n't provide a complete charge , as with cable - based systems , but it buys you some time before plugging your smartphone into the mains the device wo n’t provide a complete charge , as with cable - based systems , but it buys you some time before plugging your smartphone into the mains			2
‘ we 're rushing to finish the prototype for the @entity70 , focusing at the moment on the inductive wireless transmitter card and the receiver coils , ’ said mr @entity28			1
‘ the circuitry for the mobile charging portion has been challenging to design , as we are trying to deliver @entity78 from the receiving coil to the charging input			1
’ the @entity20 project is currently raising funds on the @entity84 website			1
the creators are hoping to receive $ 100,000 and are so far $ 588 towards their goal			0
if they can hit their target , the charger will be available from january 2014			0
the price is £ 25 , but early - bird backers can reserve one for £ 22.30 , or receive a customised version for £ 127			0
currently , only two versions of the @entity20 charging system are available for the @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 and for the @entity97 , @entity98 and 5			1
when placed near each other , the charger will wireless supply the receiver with power			2
at present , the prototype runs off a 9v battery , and provides @entity105 from the receiver			0
the goal is to reduce this to @entity108 on the charger and up the voltage to @entity111 from the receiver while maintaining a slim profile			0

device charges using inductive coil in packaging that is just 5.5mm thick
receiver is attached to the back of a mobile and connected using a usb
@entity20 is currently only *compatible* with @entity123 and @entity97
