he boasted to undercover reporters about a @entity4 event , saying : ‘ i was sitting next to @entity18 and i said to her , “ do you want a @entity21 ? ” , and she said , “ yeah , go on then			1
” party time : @entity2 is planning to have a big bash to celebrate her 41st birthday so i went up and got her a @entity21 – a curry			1

they are described , respectively , as ‘ a socialist ’ and ‘ a convict ’			2
what ’s murdoch done to deserve this description ? ‘ nothing , ’ says one of the characters , ‘ but he ’s from @entity87			2
’ author @entity88 – a @entity71 broadcaster – might have known this would go down well at the @entity54			0
