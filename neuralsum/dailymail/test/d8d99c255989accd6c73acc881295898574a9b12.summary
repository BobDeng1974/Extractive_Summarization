incredible footage has captured the moment a huge stingray nibbles on a freediver ’s head , gliding back and forth over the man ’s body gently on the ocean floor			1
the video shows the incredibly peaceful encounter between the ray and @entity11 , a 29 - year - old commercial diver and ocean lover			1
mr @entity11 was free diving in water four metres deep ; holding his breath and diving down to the depths of the ocean on @entity19 off the coast of @entity21			1
@entity11 says he felt completely at ease with the stingray , although he was aware of the risks the commercial diver was free diving four metres beneath the ocean when he had his snuggle with the ray ‘ i was totally at peace			1
i loved that thing going over the top of me , ’ @entity11 said of the experience the video shows the swimmer completely motionless in the seagrass , with the enormous 150 kilogram ray rubbing itself back and forward over his body - even nibbling at his head			1
‘ i blew all my air out and was totally calm and at his level , ’ explained mr @entity11 during a mini documentary produced for his production company @entity39			1
mr @entity11 was completely enveloped underneath the stingray , but he remained calm and insists he relished every minute of the wonderful experience			1
