by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 26 may 2013 when @entity2 was released , parents were rightfully delighted that finally a @entity4 film had been made with a strong female role model who did n’t need a prince to whisk her off her feet			1
unlike most other @entity4 heroines , the animation character of princess @entity9 looked like a real girl , complete with the ‘ imperfections ’ most people have			1
but now the plucky freckled redhead has been given a makeover for a new range of toys – which critics claim has left the character looking ‘ sexualised ’			2
brave choice ? a realistic @entity9 as she appears in the film ( left ) and the beautified version as she appears in the new toy range ( right ) the character ’s new doll and its promotional images appear slimmer , older and more glamorous compared with @entity9 ’s more homespun tomboy look in last year ’s @entity31 - winning @entity30 animation			1
the free - spirited @entity33 archer has been given an unrealistically tiny waist , sleekly tousled hair , bigger eyes , a buxom chest , longer lashes and manicured eyebrows			0
and her new look has not gone down at all well with @entity2 fans			2
a petition calling on @entity4 to return the character to her more realistic origins has reached more than 200,000 signatures in less than two weeks			0
@entity9 is not a typical @entity4 heroine and became popular for her strength , feistiness and skill with a bow and , according to critics on @entity54 , the makeover has stripped away the positive things @entity9 represented to young girls – her confidence , disregard for the way she looks and her lack of desire to be rescued by a handsome prince			1
the mischievous , innocent look in her eye has also gone , they say			0
now the petition , on the website change.org has gained the support of one of @entity9 ’s original creators , @entity71			2
mrs @entity71 , who was replaced as director by @entity75 part way through the production of @entity2 but maintained a co-director ’s credit , said : ‘ i think it ’s atrocious what they have done to @entity9			1
‘ when little girls say they like [ the new toy ] because it ’s more sparkly , that ’s all fine and good but , subconsciously , they are soaking in the sexy “ come - hither ” look and the skinny aspect of the new version			0
it ’s horrible ! ' the @entity4 princess range , with the controversial @entity9 in the centre she added : ‘ @entity9 was created to break that mould			2
to give young girls a better , stronger role model , a more attainable role model , something of substance , not just a pretty face that waits around for romance			1
’ other characters in the @entity99 , including @entity100 , @entity101 and the @entity103 ’s @entity102 , all have similar body shapes but appear to not have been altered from the original animations			0
@entity4 said it uses different styles of art on characters regularly , ‘ changing them to fit their needs at the time ’			0
following complaints , @entity4 has removed the new @entity9 image from its princess collection website .			0

@entity9 from @entity2 appears sleeker and ' sexualised ' in new *incarnation*
