by @entity0 and @entity1 eat your heart out @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , there 's a new cougar in town - and she 's out done all of you by dating a man 60 years her junior			1

when the hosts tried to unpick @entity18 's attraction for his great - granny girlfriend , @entity18 from @entity36 , explained , ' everyone has their thing that they like			1
it 's hard to explain what visually attracts me to @entity16 , but i like the platinum hair , i like the skin , i like the features			1
' ' if wanted cheerleaders , i would have cheerleaders – you have to go for what you ’re attracted to			2
but the attraction is definitely physical , ' he added			0

' @entity55 , i can put my leg up on his shoulder			0
i have pictures to prove it , ' she confirmed			0

‘ i ’ve often dated younger men but not that much younger , ' she said via satellite from @entity27 , where the 91 - year - old lives			1
@entity18 and @entity16 stroll along arm - in - arm in @entity27 even though the pair get it on regularly , their relationship is n't exclusive			1
' i do n’t really mind , i did at first but i got over it , ' said @entity16 of their arrangement			1

we ’ve been out a couple of times but generally it ’s very physical			0
' when @entity89 asked bluntly whether they just meet up to have sex , @entity18 replied , ‘ it sounds so dirty when you put it that way			1

' i do n’t believe in karma but i could walk outside and get hit by a car so generally it 's not something i think about			0
' i ’ve never wanted kids			0
i ’m not against the idea of being with one women but i have n’t found someone who ’s stopped me in my tracks			2
but that does n't prevent @entity18 from taking his granny girlfriends home to meet his mum			1
‘ mums ok with it , ' he said			0
' at first she thought it was phase , but however many years later she now thinks , " that ’s just @entity18 "			2

' the call centre worker was just 18 when he first acted on his attraction for older women and began a sexual relationship with a 50 - year - old			1
now @entity18 uses dating websites to find women as well as chatting them up in his daily life			1
he said : ' most of the time , the average age i go for is between 60 and 80			2

i amaze myself , he amazes me			0
@entity18 mother @entity145 , ( r ) says she has realised that her sons preference for older women like @entity16 ( @entity143 ) is more than a phase ' i wear sexy outfits to bed			1
i try to keep my bra on though because i do n't have much left			0
' my family consists mostly of boys , and they do n't really care - what i do is my business			2
' their ages are 71 , 63 , 61 , 52 and 50			2
' when people see us out together they probably think that he 's my son , or maybe even a grandson			0
' and while many of the women he dates ca n't believe such a young man would find them attractive , @entity18 is adamant he does			1
