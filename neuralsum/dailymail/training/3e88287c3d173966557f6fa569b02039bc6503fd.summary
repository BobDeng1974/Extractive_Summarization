in @entity14 city in southwest @entity3 's @entity15 pet shop owner @entity12 can not satisfy demand among the country 's new middle class who want the cute dogs as pets			1
dogs that look like pandas have become a huge hit with @entity3 's middle class as more and more of the nation 's citizens look to own a dog as a companion the cute animals have been selling out at pet shops across @entity3			1
the panda dog is groomed and coloured in a certain way to make it resemble the nation 's unique bear ' ten years ago the natural instinct of a @entity3 person was to eat a dog , ' he said			1
' now we are like westerners and want one as a companion			0
the cute breeds like @entity46 bulldogs and labradors were the favourites , but now it is the panda dog			0
' actually @entity50 is being disingenuous			0
the panda dog is not a separate breed of pooch at all , but rather a chow which has undergone a lot of cosmetic tomfoolery to make it resemble the panda			2
in @entity14 city in southwest @entity3 's @entity15 pet shop owner @entity12 can not satisfy demand for the cuddly - looking creatures the real thing : pet owners in @entity3 are willing to pay extra to have their dogs look like giant pandas pet shop owner @entity12 says there are ' no chemicals or cruelty ' involved in turning chows into miniature panda lookalikes he went on : ' i perfected the technique here and now it is spreading across the country			1
' with a bit of careful grooming and colouring it is easy to turn a chow into a panda dog in about two hours			2
' then the look will stay with the dog for around six weeks and the owners bring them back for some touching up			2
' there are no chemicals or cruelty involved			0
' but the price of the dog does rise significantly because of the amount of grooming that goes into it			0
people do n't mind paying the extra though - they like the fact that heads turn in the street and they can tell their friends : " i have a panda dog "			0
' cuddly : it takes about two hours to groom and colour a normal dog so it looks like a panda			0
