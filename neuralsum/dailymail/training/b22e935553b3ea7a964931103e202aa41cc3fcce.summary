of all people , one would expect @entity1 to believe in the power of luck			1
in march , football fans around the world watched in horror as the @entity8 player fell to the ground during an @entity11 match against @entity12 and lay motionless			1
he suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped for 78 minutes			1
the nation was joined in prayer but privately even the most optimistic person did not expect him to survive			1
yet , against seemingly insurmountable odds , he did			1
just five per cent of those who suffer a similar attack will live			1
and , more than that , the 24 - year - old has made a full recovery			1
unbelievably lucky ? not so			1
‘ first aid saved my life , ’ he says			1
‘ there is no such thing as luck when it comes to a cardiac arrest – it ’s about having the right people there at the right time			2
i would n’t be here now if it was n’t for the first aid i had been given in the moments after i collapsed			2
quick action : @entity1 is seen receiving first aid after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch during an @entity11 game ‘ i ca n’t express how grateful i still am for the care i received			1
’ last week , @entity1 was guest of honour at the @entity45 ceremony			1
launched last year by @entity47 , it recognises the bravery and courage of everyday heroes whose first - aid skills save lives			2
@entity1 says he could n’t be a better example of why everyone should have at least a basic knowledge of first aid			1
when his heart stopped , the medics who rushed on to the pitch could be seen desperately administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( @entity61 ) – manually breathing into the mouth and then pumping the chest to keep the blood flowing around his body and oxygen going to his brain			2
the footballer was then given three shocks using a defibrillator , but his heart still did not start			2
it was only after being transferred to an ambulance and receiving 12 more electrical shocks that his heart started working again			2
in the months that followed , doctors were astounded as he recovered without suffering any brain damage			2
the speed of his treatment on the pitch was key : for every minute of delay in starting @entity61 , the chance of survival reduces by ten per cent			1
in @entity1 ’s case , he was treated within seconds of his heart stopping			1
tribute : @entity1 with @entity91 , right , who saved his friend @entity92 , left , and was praised at the @entity45 he remembers nothing of the collapse or the days after , but he does recall when he was first able to go to the lavatory normally			1
‘ my kidney was n’t working as i had been down for so long , but one day it just kicked in and my urine was normal			2
i could n’t go before that , which was uncomfortable , but when i could go again it was better than any present i could have been given			2
’ @entity1 has had a pacemaker fitted to correct the irregular heartbeat that caused his collapse and he has been forced to retire from professional football			1
‘ i am happy though , ’ he says			2
‘ i am getting better every day and i now spend my time doing different things , such as being with my friends and family			2
’ @entity108 , chief executive of @entity45 , says @entity1 ’s case epitomises how vital first aid training is			1
‘ his incident raised public awareness of the need for first aid to a new level , ’ she said			2
‘ as the tragedy unfolded on tv , millions saw how important it can be in an emergency			1
@entity1 was lucky he was surrounded by people who knew first aid , who were the difference between life and death			1
but it should n’t be the case that people are lucky to have a first - aider nearby – it ’s a simple skill everyone can learn and we hope these awards encourage people to take that first step			0
’ also presenting an award last week was @entity133 ’ den star @entity134 , who realised the value of first aid recently			0
last month , the 63 - year - old suffered excruciating chest pains and collapsed on to the floor of his office			0
his secretary walked in and quickly dialled 999			0
his staff , who are trained in first aid , knew he had collapsed into the recovery position , had a regular heartbeat and was lucid , so should be left where he was			1
within minutes an ambulance had arrived and he was taken to hospital where his heart was monitored with an ecg			0
‘ i thought it was a heart attack or a stroke but it was a panic attack , ’ says @entity134			0
‘ i am going through a stressful divorce			0
if i have to sell part of the business to pay for it , people will lose their jobs			0
some of them are single parents and it ’s a very difficult time			0
’ scare : shocked @entity12 and @entity8 players watch @entity1 being treated by medical staff after his collapse saviours : consultant cardiologist @entity166 leads the ways as @entity1 is taken off the pitch in march this year @entity134 , who runs a chain of gyms and hotels , says he reduced his working hours slightly following the scare , but has now returned to his regular schedule and works out with a personal trainer			1
he says : ‘ my staff are trained in first aid but i ’d never realised how important it was to be surrounded by people confident in a crisis			1
’ for thousands of @entity182 there is no such quick recovery			1
up to 140,000 people who die each year might have been saved if those around them had known first aid			0
the @entity187 was set up to honour those who have used first aid for the first time with remarkable results			0
in 1998 , @entity191 , 17 , died after a motorbike crash because he was not given basic first aid to ensure he could breathe			0
his mother , @entity194 , has since campaigned for everyone – especially the young – to learn first - aid skills , and was instrumental in setting up the @entity197			0
on monday , @entity47 readers voted for @entity91 , 17 , to be crowned winner of this year ’s trophy			0
@entity91 , from @entity201 , @entity202 , saved the life of his friend @entity92 who had fallen through the ice of a local canal			0
full - recovery : @entity1 's miraculous recovery has progressed so well that he is set to take part in the @entity211 special of @entity212 the two had just left a house - party when @entity92 ventured on to what he thought was a road , but was actually a grey , frozen canal			1
within seconds he had fallen through the ice and was pulled away from the hole he had created			0
@entity91 quickly ran down the bank , wrapped his legs around a tree stump and leaned across the ice , plunging his upper body below the water and reaching out into the darkness until he felt his friend ’s fingertips			0
after hauling him out , he noticed @entity92 was showing signs of hypothermia , so he took him back to the house and warmed him up slowly – a trick that prevents the body from going into shock			0
‘ i just did what i had been trained to do , ’ @entity91 says			0
‘ i felt calm and knew i had to get down there and get @entity92 out			0
i ’m really pleased i won this award – i think first aid should be a basic skill that everyone has			0
’ the @entity241 was given to @entity243 security guard @entity242 , whose quick thinking saved the life of a choking baby			0
after performing back - slaps and removing the obstruction from the infant ’s mouth , he calmly handed the child back to its father and returned to work			0
other winners included @entity256 , a retired firefighter who saved the life of a fellow football player whose heart stopped while playing in a charity match in @entity261			1
‘ we want to thank @entity47 ’s readers for their incredible support for our awards , ’ says @entity108			0
‘ without them we would n’t be where we are today			0
all the entrants are winners in our eyes , and their incredible stories prove there is no greater gift than to give someone their life back			0

@entity8 player was only given a five per cent chance to survive
@entity1 has made a full recovery and thanks the emergency *service* staff 's *swift* action
