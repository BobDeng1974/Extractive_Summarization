earlier this week scientists were left baffled by a huge feature that surfaced in the seas of @entity3 that measured a staggering 100 square miles - the size of @entity5 or the city of @entity7 in the @entity8			1
and in the latest speculation a number of theories have been considered including a giant iceberg and a huge field of bubbles			1
speaking to @entity16 , two scientists explained their thoughts on what it might have been and that they hope to learn more upon repeated observations early next year			1
in this series of images from the @entity26 spacecraft the giant object 100 square miles ( 260 square kilometres ) in size is seen rising out of one of @entity3 's largest seas before disappearing again			1
in the latest image on the right the object still seems to be partially submerged beneath the surface in july 2013 the giant feature was seen surfacing from under the liquid before partially disappearing again in august this year			1
regarding the iceberg theory one scientist explains how , if it 's the correct assumption , they might differ to icebergs on @entity40			2
' for a bit of background , on @entity40 it 's quite a simple situation because ice floats in water , ' @entity45 , a graduate student at @entity46 who works on the @entity47 , tells @entity16			1
' on @entity3 it 's more complicated because you have a methane and ethane mixture , we think , and there 's nitrogen from the atmosphere that also gets dissolved			2
the iceberg theory is one of the more favoured ones at the moment			0
this suggests some frozen mass , perhaps frozen methane and ethane , was dislodged from the seabed and rose to the surface			2
another theory is that this may be a vast field of bubbles released by underground vents of volcanoes that are now resting on the surface			1
it could also be surface waves drifting across the sea , although this theory is unlikely as @entity3 is tidally locked to @entity79 ( the same face also points towards the planet ) so its seas to not have tides as dramatic as those seen on @entity40			1
one theory that that has been ruled out is that this is a land mass. @entity45 from @entity46 says if it was it would have been visible under the liquid in the previous images			0
' so when you freeze it , it undergoes complicated composition changes			0
' whether you can get icebergs that can float is a matter for debate , but it 's possible			0
' when it warms those icebergs could switch from sinking to floating			0
' @entity45 explains how the northern hemisphere , where the iceberg was spotted , is currently transitioning from spring time to summer			2
this process might be responsible for warming the sub-surface icebergs , which then caused them to rise from the seabed			0
other processes like currents in the sea could also be dislodging such features			0
another theory is that it is a bubble , although not necessarily a giant bubble across the whole feature			2
@entity45 says it could be a series of smaller bubbles spread over the huge area , each perhaps just centimetres in size			0
the cause of these bubbles could be vents , undersea volcanoes or seasonal changes			1
one theory that can be ruled out , however , is that this is some sort of giant non-ice land mass that has risen from the depths			0
this is because the radar system on @entity26 can penetrate into the liquid so it would have spotted such a land mass. ' if this was a land mass or mud flat under the sea , we should have seen it in earlier images because the radar would have penetrated , ' he explains			1
a comparison image from 26 april 2007 ( left ) shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in the region of interest			2
the feature was spotted by @entity141 's @entity26 spacecraft , which is currently in orbit around the @entity79 system			1
on the right is an image of @entity3 in orbit around @entity79 another feature of the images is that the object appears to be fading			1
' i do n't know if that 's anything to do with what 's under the liquid ; we see it 's decreased in brightness an extending			0
' so what could be happening is it 's spreading out and becoming less concentrated in one area , and spreading into a larger area			0
' the feature is certainly rare , although it 's possible that more may be spotted in future			2
this specific area will be imaged by radar again early in 2015 , and exactly what state the feature is in will surely be of huge interest			0
one of @entity141 's future proposals to @entity3 is for a boat to sail the seas , but @entity45 says features like this would not necessarily be a threat to such a mission			1
' perhaps the boat could help us nail down what is happening here , ' he says			0
this is an artist 's impression of the @entity182 ( @entity183 ) capsule , a proposed mission to perform the first direct inspection of an ocean environment beyond @entity40 by landing in , and floating on , a methane - ethane sea on @entity79 ’s largest moon : @entity3 speaking to @entity190 from the @entity191 , who also works on the @entity26 mission , agreed that it may have been some sort of iceberg akin to something we see on @entity40			1
' it could be something floating that sunk and came back to the surface , ' she says			0
' i was thinking almost like an iceberg , similar to something in @entity40 's oceans			2
' but she does n't rule out the possibility of it being some sort of giant bubble , or even surface waves			2
she goes on to explain that the feature may have arisen due to the change in season at @entity79			2
the first image in 2007 was taken ' around @entity79 equinox [ when the sun is above the equator ] , and then the latest image is now heading towards northern summer solstice on @entity79			2
' that 's sort of an ongoing theme for a lot of the @entity26 results ; a lot of things depend on the season at @entity79 as it moves in orbit			1
' because this lake itself is actually near to @entity3 's northern pole , perhaps it is something to do with illumination conditions			1
' the feature was spotted in @entity233 ( shown ) , one of the largest seas on @entity3 , and was observed by @entity26 's radar experiment			1
several theories currently exist including surface waves , rising bubbles , floating solids , solids suspended just below the surface or ' something more exotic ' according to @entity141 the feature was spotted by @entity141 's @entity26 spacecraft , which is currently in orbit around the @entity79 system			1
it was spotted in @entity233 , one of the largest seas on @entity3 , and was observed by @entity26 's radar instrument			1
in images from 10 july 2013 to 21 august 2014 the feature is shown rising and then falling below the surface			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity3 resembles a frozen version of @entity40 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
because @entity3 is smaller than @entity40 , its gravity does n't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			2
as on @entity40 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity3 are about seven @entity40 years long			0
@entity3 's ' water ' is liquid methane , @entity273 , better known on @entity40 as natural gas			1
regular @entity40 - water , @entity276 , would be frozen solid on @entity3 where the surface temperature is @entity278 ( -292 ° f )			2
with @entity3 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity40 's raindrops			1
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
a comparison image from 26 april 2007 shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region			0
the mysterious feature appears bright in the radar images , suggesting it has a somewhat similar composition to the land nearby in the image			0
this supports one theory that it may be a solid structure that surfaced from under the liquid before sinking again for an unknown reason			0
the dark area in the image is the liquid hydrocarbon sea on @entity3 's surface , while the bright area to the right is land			1
scientists on the radar team are confident that the feature is not an artifact - or flaw - in their data			0
they have also ruled out the possibility of it being due to evaporation , as the nearby shoreline has not changed much			0
several theories currently exist including surface waves , rising bubbles , floating solids , solids suspended just below the surface or ' something more exotic ' according to @entity141			1
the appearance of the feature may also be due to changing seasons on @entity3 , with summer drawing near in the moon 's northern hemisphere			1
monitoring these changes is a major goal of @entity26 's current extended mission			1
' science loves a mystery , and with this enigmatic feature , we have a thrilling example of ongoing change on @entity3 , ' said dr @entity337 , the deputy team lead of @entity26 's radar team , based at @entity141 's @entity340 in @entity341 , @entity342			1
' we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to continue watching the changes unfold and gain insights about what 's going on in that alien sea			0
' it 's not just @entity3 that is thought to have an active surface ; earlier this month scientists found the first sign of geologic activity on a solar system world other than @entity354			1
experts from the @entity356 and the @entity357 , @entity358 , say @entity354 could be more @entity40 - like than experts imagined			0
the latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists			0
it shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding			0
many parts of @entity354 's surface show evidence of extension , where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart , and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap , a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading , according to the study published in the journal @entity379			0
@entity354 's surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old , which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics			0
it has been a decade since @entity26 entered orbit around @entity79 ( illustration shown )			1
in june the @entity26 mission celebrated 10 years of exploring the planet , its rings and moons			0
it arrived for a four - year mission but has since been continuously extended , although it will almost certainly end in 2017			0

two scientists have told @entity16 that they think the giant object on @entity79 's @entity3 could have been an iceberg
*astronomers* at @entity141 in @entity342 were left baffled by its appearance
it 's possible the giant feature *emerged* from under the sea as @entity3 's @entity404 moves from spring to summer and heats up
this may have dislodged the potential iceberg from the seabed
however one expert says this would not be a threat to future boats planned to explore the seas of @entity3
the massive object appeared in one of @entity3 's largest seas in july 2013 before disappearing beneath the surface again in august 2014
it could also be a field of rising bubbles from vents or undersea volcanoes
monitoring changes like this is one of the *key* goals of @entity141 's @entity26 spacecraft that is currently in orbit in the @entity79 system
