improvements needed : education secretary @entity1 has said more must be done only in one in four graduates is good at maths and @entity5 , a study revealed yesterday			1
the dismal results come despite a surge in education spending and record numbers of university students			1
the @entity11 found that just 25 per cent of @entity12 with a degree scored highly in a literacy test			1
yet their peers in @entity16 and @entity17 scored 37 per cent , the @entity18 36 per cent and @entity19 32 per cent			1
@entity20 with 28 per cent and @entity21 with 26 per cent also fared better			0
the @entity12 ’s position in numeracy was similar or slightly worse			1
the @entity11 said the rise in the number of graduates was not matched by a rise in skill levels			0
@entity29 , the policy group ’s director for education and skills , said : ‘ not all further education qualifications really deserve that name because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than those people who have just come out of school			0
' @entity12 universities have a very strong reputation – you would have expected this stronger prevalence among the most highly skilled			1
’ mr @entity29 suggested schools may partly be to blame : ‘ one of the things which may of course be true is that literacy and numeracy reflect things that you learn well before university			1
‘ in @entity16 they build the foundations for literacy and numeracy at high school , and universities can build on this			1
‘ it ’s not true for the @entity12			1
this may be a reflection of this – universities assume those skills are there , but they might not be			0
’ it also emerged that the growth in higher education has mainly benefited the middle classes			0
poor scores : only a quarter of @entity12 graduates did well in a literacy test , research found ( file photo ) a child ’s chances of going to university are still strongly influenced by their family background , partly because many disadvantaged children are ‘ doomed ’ by poor schooling			1
‘ many countries are doing better than the @entity12 , ’ said mr @entity29			1
‘ the @entity12 has seen huge increases in access but that has n’t translated into the degree of mobility we have seen in the @entity88 , in @entity89 , in @entity17 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and so on			1
’ class sizes in @entity12 primary schools are among the biggest in the developed world , according to research			2
the average teaching group now has 25 pupils – the sixth largest out of 33 countries studied by the @entity11			0
@entity12 primary classes are bigger than the international average of 21 and significantly larger than countries such as @entity103 , with 16 per group			2
the figures also show that the @entity12 average class creeps up to 26 when private schools are taken out of consideration			2
in @entity12 independent schools , the average class size is just 15			2
at secondary level , class sizes are also comparatively large among 14 to 18 - year - olds			0
and in nursery education , there are around 19 children per teacher , higher than the @entity11 average of 14 pupils per teacher			0
the figures show there are 17 pupils per teacher in upper secondary classes – the fourth highest out of 29 countries included in the analysis			0
only @entity128 , @entity129 and the @entity18 have more pupils per teacher			0
the @entity11 report said there was some evidence smaller classes benefited specific groups of pupils , such as those from poorer backgrounds , but only a ‘ weak ’ link to pupil performance overall			0
the findings came in the @entity11 ’s annual analysis of international league tables titled ‘ @entity145 ’			0
for the first time , the number of graduates outstrips the numbers who stopped studying after gaining their gcses or a-levels			0
forty - one per cent of 25 - to 64 - year - olds have a degree while 37 per cent have no qualification higher than an a-level or equivalent			2
the tables also show that while the @entity12 ranks eighth among 36 countries for the number of graduates it produces , the level of basic skills among those with a higher qualification is merely average			1
to gauge graduate skill levels , the @entity11 drew on research published last year which involved setting a sample of adults in nations across the developed world a test in literacy and numeracy			2
in the @entity12 , only @entity5 and @entity92 took part in the tests			2
employers have repeatedly complained that both graduates and school - leavers lack the skills in the three rs needed to succeed in the workplace			0
elsewhere , the @entity11 report noted that the @entity12 had increased education spending as a percentage of gdp faster than all other @entity11 countries			1
but this has so far failed to translate into top scores for our education system			0
‘ the time that the massive increase in investment actually translates into better outcomes is still to come , ’ said mr @entity29			0
education secretary @entity1 said : ‘ i ’m committed to going further faster towards creating an education system that enables all young people , regardless of background are able to reach their full potential			1

just a quarter of @entity12 with a degree scored highly in a literacy test
the total compared to 37 **%** in @entity16 and @entity17 and 36 **%** in @entity206
results come despite record numbers of university students in the @entity12
education secretary @entity1 said more progress is needed
