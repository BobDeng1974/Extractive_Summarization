by @entity0 today is the longest day and the summit of the year for us gardeners , filled with more light than any other			1
increasingly , the plants that i enjoy most at this time of year are not the wonderful flowers in the borders but the umbellifers – a family of plants with long stems and flowers forming clusters called umbels – that catch the late evening light like lit , upturned chandeliers			1
they do not just look beautiful either			2
all umbellifers attract into the garden beneficial insects like ladybirds , hoverflies and lacewings , which in turn are your best defence against aphids			1
the plants that @entity0 enjoys most at this time of year are the umbellifers - a family of plants with long stems and flowers forming clusters called umbels birds too are attracted in autumn by the seeds , so they instantly enrich the wildlife of your garden			1
@entity40 when should i trim my box hedge ? @entity42 , @entity43 a right now ! the traditional date was @entity45 , which is at the end of the first week in june			2
in practice , this is after the risk of frost has safely passed , so depending where you live , any time between the beginning of may and end of june is ideal			1
this gives time for new growth to harden off before the autumn frosts			1
q half of my 25 - year - old @entity59 ' has turned brown			1
is this a disease or old age ? @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 a it is not age – at 25 your plants are babies – nor is it disease			2
it is the cypress aphid , which sucks sap from the trees , causing the foliage to die back			2
the plants can recover and regrow – but often do not			2
the only solution is to cut the hedge down , grub out the roots and plant another , less vulnerable evergreen hedge such as yew			1
q the petals of my @entity83 , which lives in the porch , are turning brown			2
why is this happening ? mrs @entity87 , @entity88 a @entity89 could be petal blight , which is encouraged by excess moisture and poor ventilation			0
if the petals first develop dark brown veins then this is an indication of blight			0
or it could be sunscald caused by the sunlight being magnified by the glass of the porch			0
a shadier location – ideally west - facing – would avoid this			0
write to @entity102 , @entity103 , 2 @entity104 , @entity105 or email monty.don@dailymail.co.uk			0
please include your full name and address			0
we regret @entity0 ca n't reply to letters personally many umbellifers add a tall , even stately element to the garden , whether growing in a border or ' wild ' at the fringes			1
mind you , some are taller than others			0
my @entity119 that i made last year is based upon the spirit of cow parsley ( @entity122 ) , which froths so gloriously along our verges in may			1
by now it has all but disappeared but there are plenty of good garden plants that capture its free , floating spirit			1
@entity130 is perhaps the most exact garden version and it is at its very best right now			1
it is a biennial that is best sown in september , so it 's a good idea to order your seeds now			1
keep it over the winter with a bit of protection ( a cold frame is ideal ) and then plant it out in spring , when it will grow to about 1 - 1.3m ( 3 - 4ft ) topped with clean white florets			1
the only drawback that i have so far discovered is that it can be irresistible to rabbits			0
@entity146 , the white lace flower , is a superb and graceful annual with rather larger flower heads that can be sown either in spring for flowering in late summer or in september for an earlier display the following year			1
it will flower continuously for about ten weeks so is excellent value in any border			0
@entity155 grows huge on my damp , rich soil			0
it self - seeds vigorously so needs thinning if it is not to become too invasive , but in its right place it is an absolute joy			0
no plant is more popular with butterflies , hoverflies , bees and wasps than the lovely , plum - coloured umbellifer @entity166			1
it starts out slowly , easing itself into summer with modest foliage , but in late july it throws up a 2m ( 6ft ) - tall crimson stem topped with a beautiful bud that opens to reveal umbellifer flowers of the deepest burgundy			0
you can buy it to plant out now – it is monocarpic , which means that it dies back once it has set seed , but the seeds will produce a rash of seedlings that can be lifted and moved to wherever you wish to place them , so the plant can live on through its offspring for years			1
i grow @entity188 in a pot but it is a spectacular plant nevertheless , which deserves – and gets from me – pride of place			2
the white umbels are touched with pink and carried on tall , upright stems that last for months			0
the roots are apparently irresistible to cats and rats but the leaves are a sedative for humans			0
the common fennel ( @entity204 vulgare ) exemplifies all the virtues of umbellifers : open , lacy , towering but not shading anything beneath it			0
the leaves are the perfect accompaniment to baked or barbecued fish and the seeds are delicious too , both rubbed into a joint of pork and to munch on by the handful			0
good for the tummy too			0
finally , one of my favourite umbellifers is sweet cicely ( @entity221 ) , which grows in quite deep shade			2
as with fennel , you can buy it to plant out now , and all of it can be eaten , from root to flower to seed			2
it tastes of aniseed and is good cooked with tart fruits such as rhubarb or gooseberries because it reduces the acidity .			0

@entity0 's favourite plant at this time of year is the @entity240
they attract beneficial insects to the garden such as ladybirds
