one such grandmother , 77 - year - old @entity22 - also known as @entity24 's @entity23 - regularly runs ultra-marathons of 100 km each			1
' i hope i will still be running at the age of 100 ! ' says @entity22 who , at 77 - years - old runs ultra-marathons of 100 km each the @entity30 - bomber , as she is known to her friends , only took up running at the age of 55 when she thought that it was time that she ' started to live a little bit more healthily			1
' since making that decision she has pounded her way through 100 pairs of trainers and competed in such celebrated urban races as the @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 marathons			1
' i first started to run 100 metres to see if i even could do that			1
then i went for 200 , 500 and after a while i participated at race of 5,000 metres ' , she said			0
' sometimes i have to ask the organisers not to pack up and go home before i cross the finish line			0
' i am a bit slower than many , but i always make a point of completing a race			0
' the most gruelling i recall was 111 kilometres , but it took me 24 hours ' , said @entity22 , adding that she runs for health and fun , not for results - although it remains a fact that she has won 35 different medals			1
' some even do n't believe it when i say i am a granny " , she said			0
' i think they expect me to sit at home and knit , or something			0
@entity66 , 51 , from @entity67 , only took up running at 36 but has still managed to break records in the sport , and this weekend will face another grueling challenge as she competes in the 250 km @entity72 marathon the grandmother has previously ran the @entity75 ultra marathon in @entity76 twice in a row ' but there is nothing like the wind in your face and the adrenalin pumping through your body to make you feel good			1
i hope i will still be running at the age of 100 ! ' another @entity23 who is racing into the the record books is @entity87 , 51 , from @entity67			1
the grandmother to @entity89 , aged five , and @entity90 , two , only took up running at 36 but has still managed to break records in the sport			2
having suffered an eating disorder in her youth for 15 years she says it was taking up running at the age of 36 that gave her the incentive to battle the condition			2
she has won numerous world records for her endurance feats including the fastest crossing on foot across @entity104 ( 345 miles in three days , 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes ) and the furthest distance covered on a treadmill by a female over seven days			1
this weekend @entity66 will compete in the @entity72 , a 250km super marathon set in the dry heat of the @entity110			2
the race is self - sufficient meaning @entity66 will be carrying all of her kit and equipment for the entire race , which includes a sleeping bag , food , safety equipment and a minimum of 2.5 litres , while running in extreme heat			0
despite the monumental task ahead of her , @entity66 says on her blog that she is excited about the challenge			0
' i canâ € ™ t tell you how excited i am to have the opportunity to run once again in such a stunning location , with the added bonus of all the wild life we will see ; so close sometimes you could almost touch them			0
' my pink camera is charging and ready to go ! one of the reasons i began running in the first place was to see amazing countries like @entity136 , ' she says .			0
