by @entity0 a family are still desperately searching for a missing mum after she vanished during a shopping trip near her home in @entity5 , @entity6 , three years ago			1
@entity7 was 38 years old when she disappeared leaving behind her husband of seven years , @entity10 , her then two - year - old son @entity9 , now five , and her older sister , @entity11			1
‘ has someone got hold of her ? has something horrible happened to her ? it just does n't make sense , ’ @entity11 says fighting back tears on tonight ’s @entity19 documentary , @entity18			0
‘ she would n't just run off on her own			0
that child was everything to her			0
i do n't believe she would have taken off and left her baby behind , ’ says @entity11 as the documentary airs touching home video footage of a doting mother kissing her little boy and saying , ‘ i love you ’			1
@entity7 's distraught family is unable to continue normal life and unable to grieve , but live in hope that they will one day be reunited			1
@entity7 , 38 , has not been seen since leaving her home at @entity5 in a silver @entity41 three years ago after @entity7 ’s disappearance , her husband and son moved to @entity45 and in a heart - wrenching moment little @entity9 talks about the mother he hardly remembers			1
' she went to the shops by herself			1
she did n't know the way home , then she got lost somewhere , ' he says as he plays at home with his father			0
@entity10 tries to describe how hard it ’s been for his son , ‘ i ca n't understand what 's going on			0
think about his little brain -- how he 's trying to cope with the situation			0
’ turning to his own experience he says , ‘ you ’re always fighting between your heart and your mind			0
your heart is saying she 's coming back but your logic is saying the probability is getting low			0
’ an hour after @entity7 left for the shops that fateful morning , her silver @entity41 was clocked on @entity72 footage in the nearby town of @entity74			1
since her disappearance @entity11 has gone to extraordinary lengths to bring her sister home and has visited @entity74 fifteen times in the hope of uncovering further evidence			1
‘ it hurts me to be here , but i keep coming back all the time -- because she 's here somewhere and i need to find her , ’ she says bravely of her search			2
‘ i try and block it all out my head and pretend it 's not my sister			2
i hate putting these posters up			0
i see lamppost with missing dogs and cats and i 'm having to put my sister 's picture up , ’ she says reaching breaking point			2
the police found @entity7 ’s car abandoned in the town ’s parking lot , but there ’s no proof @entity7 herself was the one who drove it there			1
' there was n't a shred of evidence she was ever in @entity74 because the @entity72 footage is so appalling , you ca n't see who the driver is , ’ explains @entity11			1
' all i want is an answer and that 's when i 'll be at peace			0
there ’s a baby , who 's now five years old , who 's growing up without the love of his mum			0
' because there ’s never been a sighting of @entity7 since her disappearance , police have downgraded the investigation			1
the detective leading the search suspects suicide			2
' i know she 's here somewhere -- i just have to find her ' : @entity130 with a picture of her missing sister @entity7 @entity72 footage showed a female walking from where the car was parked towards @entity137 , a nearby hill			1
' i ca n't say whether that 's @entity7 or not but i can say the @entity72 does not pick up that person coming back down , ’ the detective explains			1
but @entity11 is convinced the woman is not her sister			2
the detective believes the passing of @entity7 ’s father in 2010 may be linked			1
‘ it affected @entity7 more because she was living away from her family , ’ he says and adds , ‘ in 70 per cent of suicides , there 's no note			1
’ but @entity11 is far from convinced and continues to publicise her plight			0
' what damn proof do they have that my sister 's dead ? ' how can you commit suicide and no one come across the body in such a public place			2
it 's still a search in my eyes			2
she could not bear to be away from her son			0
’ as she prepares to leave @entity74 , where she will no doubt return , @entity11 explains , ‘ it ’s hard coming and it ’s even harder going back			1
she ’s my flesh and blood , my only sister			2
she ’d do the same if it was me			0
’ ‘ i know i ‘ m torturing myself but how can i let it go ? with no closure , how can i let it go			0
it ’s impossible , ’ she says			0
@entity11 continues her search to bring her beloved sister home but , like thousands of families round @entity26 , a lifetime of uncertainty may lie ahead			1
@entity11 ’s search is featured in the @entity19 series @entity18 , which starts today at 10pm			0
the charity @entity184 is at : @entity185			0

@entity7 has a husband , five - year - old boy and sister
