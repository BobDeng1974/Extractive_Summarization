by @entity0 ' saddened ' : shopper @entity1 who is angry that @entity3 supermarket is selling meat in security boxes to prevent theft cheese and meat joints have been locked away in security - sealed boxes by a crime - hit supermarket in a bid to thwart hungry thieves			1
crime - hit supermarket chain @entity3 has resorted to using the ' lamb saver boxes ' , normally used to protect more expensive goods such as cds , games and dvds , which trigger an alarm if a shoplifter attempts to leave the store with meat products without paying			1
the security tactic has been employed in hundreds of the chain 's stores across the @entity26			1
checkout assistants at the stores have told customers the supermarket chain also plans to fix security tags to its cheese - or lock the dairy goods away from reach			1
@entity3 bosses said they had been forced into the ' defence mechanisms ' to stop a growing number of hungry thieves pinching its stock			1
but customers hit out at the precaution , while food charities interpreted the measure as ' inevitable ' with many families struggling to make ends meet			2
shopper @entity1 said he was ' saddened ' to to find the leg - of - lamb contained in security tagged boxes when he was doing a weekly shop			1
the motorcycle store manager and father - of - three from @entity51 , @entity52 , said : ' i just think it is sad that people feel they have to steal from @entity3 to survive			2
' what is the world coming to ? when i saw them i could n’t believe it			0
' apparently so many people steal it , they stuff it into their trousers and run out - its ridiculous			0
' you can understand them wanting the boxes because even when their security guards catch someone they ca n’t sell the food if its been stuffed down someone ’s pants			0
' @entity3 , which like most food stores already fixes security tags to luxury items , such as expensive spirits , said its new measures were needed to maximise ' availability			1
' stop thief : hungry shoplifters wo n't be stealing these lamb joints in a hurry , they are encased in a security box spokeswoman for the chain @entity108 , said : ' the lamb saver boxes are used in several hundred @entity3 stores and are designed to enhance the availability of the product for customers			1
' the boxes are designed to serve as a defence mechanism to reduce theft and thereby ensure there is maximum availability for customers			0
she confirmed that the chain had been ' trialing ' security boxes for bacon and cheese in some of their @entity26 stores			1
she said : ' the trial was run across some of our @entity26 stores but did n’t prove as effective as the lamb saver boxes			0
' @entity131 was our most targeted item as it is one of the most costly and popular items in store			0
' therefore we have seen a dramatic reduction in theft since the boxes have been introduced			0
' the security boxes were n’t as noticibly effective on lesser items such as bacon and cheese therefore we are unable to confirm they will remain a permanent fixture in stores			0
' food charities said they had seen the need for food banks in certain areas of @entity26 double in the last year			0
the @entity150 , part of the @entity26 food bank network , said they were n’t shocked to see a rise in theft from the @entity3 store , claiming some families are ' desperate ' for food			1
some of the charity ’s individual branches have reported more than a 30 per cent increase in people using food banks since the @entity26 was hit by recession in 2009			2
more than 200,000 people across @entity26 are now known to be signed - up to food banks to feed their families			2
@entity150 spokeswoman @entity167 said : ' parents will often go days without eating so they can feed their children but when they are faced with not being able to feed their two - year - old of course they turn to desperate measures			0
' food banks are based in towns and cities across the country but we still do n’t have enough and that is the worrying thing			0
' families in the @entity26 are struggling - the food banks are here to help and hopefully there for people so they do n’t have to resort to stealing			2
