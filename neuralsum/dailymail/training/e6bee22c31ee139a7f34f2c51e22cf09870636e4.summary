' he was only fifty yards away			0
we had the @entity166 because we did n't know what all the singing was about to start off with			0
' on @entity164 's wire there were bits of paper , bits of rag , and all sorts of things saying @entity177 , some in @entity1 , some in @entity2 because a lot of the @entity1 had worked in @entity2			2
' they held up a bottle of wine and i know our bloke shot at it			0
well it all got quiet			0
' i do n't know if we had breakfast that morning , i suppose we did ; we had a drink			0
everything was peaceful and eventually one of the @entity1 held up a card with " @entity177 " written on it , and come on over the top			2
' everybody was dubious in our trench , saying kind of , should we or should n't we and all of this bloomin ' caper , and then one or two more @entity1 come up			0
' then eventually we decided , well they have n't got any rifles on ' em and we went over			0
and our @entity202 who come to us as battalion commander , he kind of led the singing ! ' we did n't all group in one place , we was spread along an area about a hundred yards and we mixed in with some others and they give us a bottle of wine and cigars and we thought to ourselves , well they must be bloomin ' well - off in jerry - land			0
all we got was a tin of @entity217 's jam and we went back into the trench and brought out a couple or three tins of jam to give to these @entity222			0
