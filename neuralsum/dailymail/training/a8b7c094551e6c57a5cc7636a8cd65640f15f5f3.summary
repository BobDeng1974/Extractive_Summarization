@entity1 chairman @entity0 has warned clubs interested in @entity3 that they will not sell their £ 10million record signing at a loss			1
@entity3 is expected to leave the relegated club after the @entity7 , with @entity8 leading a group of @entity11 sides interested in the midfielder			1
the @entity13 is understood to have a release clause in his contract which approximately matches the fee @entity1 paid @entity18 last summer - a fee that started at £ 10million , but featured significant additional payments			1
@entity1 's record signing @entity3 celebrates @entity23 's first goal against @entity24 @entity25 has previously said @entity3 ‘ deserves to be playing at a higher level than the championship ’ and the 26 - year - old ’s impressive performances at the @entity7 have supported those claims after a mediocre season in @entity32			1
but @entity0 insists no offers have been received and strongly indicated that @entity3 will not be allowed to leave for less than the record fee @entity1 paid			1
he said : ‘ after what he ’s been doing out in @entity38 , there may well be a few offers on the table at the end of the tournament			0
‘ if so , and @entity3 comes to me and says he wishes to leave , i will engage in those discussions then			2
in demand : @entity3 ( right ) is being courted by a number of sides in @entity11 ‘ but even if that were to be the case , i think it ’s fair to say i ’m not known as a pushover in negotiations			2
i ’m not in the habit of selling anything at a loss			0
’ @entity55 revealed in december the sizeable outlay of @entity58 ’s signing , with his initial £ 10m fee possibly rising to £ 15m dependant on clauses			0
there was also an agent ’s fee of £ 800,000 , a signing - on fee of £ 1.25m , an image - rights fee of £ 1.6m for a player who rarely gives interviews , and a weekly basic wage of £ 35,000			0
@entity0 added : ‘ i hope that once this tournament is over , he will choose to stick around and help us try to regain our place in the @entity74			0
i ’ve had no indication whatsoever from @entity3 that he may want to go			0
@entity1 chairman @entity0 wants at least £ 10million for @entity77 @entity1 boss @entity25 has said that @entity3 should be playing at a higher level than the championship ‘ people may say that @entity3 is too good for the championship			1
but then we ’ve got lots of players who are good enough to play in the @entity74			0
‘ i ’ve no doubts that after what @entity3 has been doing in this @entity7 , there will be interested parties out there			1
‘ but he is under contract to @entity1 and sometimes it ’s not necessarily about the league you play in , it ’s about the club you play for and their ambition			2
‘ we ’ve made six summer signings already and have set out our stall to try to regain instant promotion			0
