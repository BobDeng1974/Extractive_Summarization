@entity30 have 10 minutes to get themselves back in the match			1
@entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 have failed to deliver so far			1

@entity62 's goalbound shot has just been blocked by his team - mate			0
it really has n't been @entity30 's day			1
@entity76 fans are now singing ' you 're getting sacked in the morning ' towards @entity56			0
it 's not going to be that bad for the @entity79 but it is a big opportunity missed if they fail to at least earn a replay - which is looking incredibly unlikely			0
@entity45 is flapping at everything			2
will @entity56 's decision to rest @entity84 may come back to haunt him ! just under 20 minutes left to play			0
what was @entity64 doing ? a player of his calibre should not be trying to play the ball across goal			2
that 's something you learn as a schoolboy			0
67 minutes gone and @entity30 are showing signs of frustration			1
@entity96 has just been booked			2
@entity14 's @entity42 punishes his former side for two horrific errors			1
firstly @entity64 tries to pass the ball across his box and then @entity42 's feeble shot somehow manages to find a way past @entity45			1
poor goalkeeping by the @entity104			0
the @entity30 are starting to control possession			2
@entity106 seems to be seeing a lot of the ball but he has been unable to pick out @entity62 and @entity63 thus far			1
@entity109 has been left out of today 's squad due to a slight groin injury			0
@entity56 would probably love to be able to call on the striker ! as predicted @entity62 has replaced @entity113 in attack			2
@entity56 will be hoping the 21 - year - old can pose more of a threat in attack			0
just to recap , @entity10 side @entity14 go into the interval with a 1 - 0 lead thanks to an own goal by @entity40 after just three minutes			1
the @entity122 ' goal was fortunate but fully deserved as they have been the better team			0
@entity64 has just sent a free - kick over the bar			1
the @entity30 winger has been unable to get on the ball and really run at @entity76 's defence			2
@entity56 is going to have to make a change at the interval - whether it is to the personnel or his side 's shape			0
there has been a lot of talk about @entity139 's use of long balls during the last few weeks but it is working wonders for @entity76			0

just under two minutes until the interval			0

@entity56 does not look happy on the sidelines as his side remain 1 - 0 down			2
@entity156 has been booked for a late challenge			2
38 minutes gone and @entity76 continue to dictate play			0
@entity30 boss @entity56 will be already weighing up his options to make a possible change at half - time			1
his forward players have failed to take the game to @entity14			2
@entity62 could be an option			0
here 's @entity30 's bench : @entity84 , @entity62 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity59 , @entity57 , @entity168 i think @entity30 's defence are going to struggle to contain former @entity30 striker @entity42 today			1
he 's winning everything in the air ahead of @entity173 and @entity40			1
@entity76 look extremely comfortable so far			0
24 minutes gone and @entity30 have hardly tested @entity122 goalkeeper @entity149			1
the likes of @entity64 and @entity63 have failed to show their class			1
six yards out with whole goal to aim at , how long did @entity63 want ? ! brilliant challenge from @entity179			1
@entity63 should be ashamed claiming for a penalty			2
@entity30 are finding it hard to get used to the pitch			2
@entity96 just stopped to stare at the turf after failing to get the ball under control			2
@entity76 will say the conditions are the same for both sides			0
@entity30 striker @entity63 has just had a golden opportunity to level the scoreline			1
he had an incredible amount of time to pick his spot but was tackled as he was about to pull the trigger			0
@entity63 wanted a penalty but the referee waved play on			0
the score remains 1 - 0 to @entity14 after 19 minutes			1
this has been a frenetic start - the early goal , two head injuries and @entity56 losing his rag with referee @entity202 ( twice )			0
but @entity30 's lacklustre start can be summed up by @entity106 appearing to be scared of the ball as it dropped from the sky , ducking out of a free header ! i do n't think this is his sort of contest ... i was just about to say @entity76 's pitch is in a terrible condition before @entity40 put through his own net			1
could that work in the @entity10 side 's favour ? @entity217 celebrated @entity14 's opener as he took the original shot however it will go down as an own goal as the ball was going wide before @entity40 's deflection			1
@entity217 's shot was going wide until @entity40 stuck out his leg to divert the ball into his own net			1
the @entity122 probably can not believe their luck but the scoreline is all what matters			0
@entity76 have taken the lead after just three minutes			0
@entity217 took a shot at goal from inside the penalty area which was deflected in off @entity30 defender @entity40			1
