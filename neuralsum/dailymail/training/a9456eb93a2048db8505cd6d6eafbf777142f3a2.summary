but relaxing in the sea after a training session yesterday , the muscle bound @entity14 squad looked more like film stars than hardened sportsmen			0
emerging from the water with their torsos rippling , they bore a resemblance to @entity5 actor @entity22 in his swimming trunks during a scene from 2006 film @entity25			0
the @entity14 pictured taking part in the post training recovery session at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity27 included captain @entity3 , who is currently recovering from injury and stand in captain @entity34			1
fly - half @entity38 , @entity40 born @entity37 powerhouse @entity35 and @entity41 were also among the players larking about in the water			2
they may not be looking so pretty after tomorrow 's ( wednesday ) opening game of the tour in @entity27			2
@entity46 , who captains their opponents @entity49 , warned yesterday that even if they could n't beat the @entity14 they hoped to ' hurt their bodies '			0
his team - mate , scrum - half @entity51 , added : ' we want it to be an extremely physical game			0
we want them to know they 've been in a battle			0
' the @entity14 beat @entity59 59 - 8 during a stopover in @entity61 on route to @entity27 at the weekend , but the match was over-shadowed by an ugly spat between @entity38 and hooker @entity65			1
they will play a series of warm up games before the first of three test against @entity27 in @entity71 on june 22			1
inspiration : @entity3 ( left ) bared his muscular physique as he makes a @entity75 exit from the water similar to the iconic @entity22 scene from @entity25 ( right ) making waves : if the team makes as big an impact on the pitch as they did on the beach , captain @entity3 ( above ) will be a satisfied leader horseplay : the players let loose after an intense training session			1
they will be playing warm - up games before their scheduled test matches warm - up games on @entity14 tours have been brutal affairs in the past , most infamously in 2001 , when @entity92 full back @entity91 punched @entity14 fly - half @entity94 11 times as he lay on the ground unable to defend himself			2
@entity94 required eight stiches following the vicious attack			0
@entity91 was sent off and later banned for seven weeks			0
keeping in shape : @entity38 ran from the sea to the beach in sunny @entity31 , making sure his fitness levels do n't drop between games quite a line up : ( from left to right ) @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 walk side by side @entity111 hearted : the rugby players enjoyed themselves during their session in the sea wear and tear : captain @entity115 received treatment to his left leg during the team 's training session yeaterday			1
