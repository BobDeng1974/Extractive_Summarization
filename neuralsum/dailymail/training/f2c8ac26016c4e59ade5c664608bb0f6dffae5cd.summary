@entity2 's @entity1 bike escalator is revolutionising urban transport			1
while pedal power is an inexpensive - not to mention healthy - way to get around a big city , hills can often be the bane of cyclist 's existence			2
a steep ascent is no problem however for the residents of @entity14 , in @entity2 's north east , thanks to @entity17 , the inventor of the @entity18			2
in 2013 , the lift was upgraded and rebranded as the @entity1 - and it has quickly become a tourist magnet			1
so far , it 's already ferried 200,000 cyclists up the hill at @entity33 near @entity34 , from the bridge almost all the way up to the @entity37			2
it was first built in 1993 - then called the @entity18 lift - by @entity17 in 2013 , the lift was upgraded and renamed the @entity1 - quickly becoming a tourist magnet the 420 feet - long device climbs at a gradient of between 10 and 18 per cent , and all the user has to do is put their foot on one of its 11 foot plates attached to a wire rope			1
an accelerated starting point gets users moving but after the initial first burst it 's a simple case of keeping one foot on the plate and the other off the ground to cruise up the hill at 5mph			0
it 's quite simple to use , with no reported injuries since it 's opened			0
when standing beside the @entity1 , the cyclist puts their left foot on the left pedal of their bike and their right foot in the starting slot of the base station			0
at 420 feet long , the wire rope with 11 foot plates attached , climbs at an incline between 10 and 18 per cent the @entity1 can also ferry baby strollers ( left ) and scooters ( right ) up the @entity33 hill up to five individuals can use the lift at any given time , using their bike or scooter as a form of support stretching your right leg backwards , keep the right foot on the start slot to receive the push of the soft - start mechanism			1
the lift then carries the cyclist the remainder of the distance , with the bicycle acting as merely a means of support			0
up to five people can use it at the same time and it 's actually not limited strictly to bicycles - strollers and scooters are also acceptable .			0

@entity1 is a ski lift - *inspired* bike escalator to assist cyclists on hills
*originally* built in 1993 , the wire rope *system* stretches 420 feet
since its 2013 revamp , it 's ferried over 200,000 urban cyclists in @entity2
the *contraption* has now become a tourist attraction of sorts
