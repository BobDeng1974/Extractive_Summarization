by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 28 november 2012 @entity2 : 20:26 est , 28 november 2012 the average family drinks bill will soar by almost £ 100 a year under the government ’s plan for minimum pricing for alcohol , it was revealed last night			1
the proposed @entity10 scheme will ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p per unit in an effort to target heavy drinkers			1
but research found that 59 per cent of all alcoholic units sold in off - licences and supermarkets costs less than that level – meaning their price will go up			1
increase : an average family 's drinks bill will rise by almost £ 100 if @entity6 plans to increase the minimum price of alcohol a couple who drink the average amount will see their annual grocery bill rise by around £ 94 a year			1
the finding by the respected @entity32 ( @entity32 ) is a blow for the government ’s claim that the plan will target only binge drinkers			1
yesterday , it also emerged that @entity39 may deem the scheme illegal , as @entity42 officials wrote to @entity43 , the @entity44 first minister , to warn that @entity44 ’s own minimum price plan may contravene @entity47 rules			1
they warned of possible legal action if the scheme for a 50p per unit minimum goes forward			1
wine - producing nations such as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 say it breaches @entity47 law on free trade			0
@entity59 , of the @entity58 , explained that supermarkets would simply sell more alcohol to boost profits , and she said the plan would create ‘ market distortions ’			2
as an @entity47 member state , the @entity6 had gone to court to keep the embarrassing letter to mr @entity43 secret			0
miss day said : ‘ the @entity71 authorities are invited to abstain from adopting the draft legislation at issue			0
’ the government believes imposing a 45p minimum unit price will reduce total alcohol consumption by 3.3 per cent , and cut the number of crimes by 5,000 per year and hospital admissions by 24,000			1
there will be 700 fewer alcohol - linked deaths annually , according to the predictions			2
however , the @entity32 said that while ministers are right to say the heaviest drinkers will be the most affected by price rises , there will also be an impact on moderate drinkers			0
those who drink less than seven units a week will see grocery bills rise , because 48 per cent of the units they buy tend to be less than 45p			2
the @entity32 research also found that one of the drinks most associated with binge drinking - alcopops - will hardly be affected by the minimum price at all , because it almost always costs more than 45p a unit anyway			1
@entity10 minister @entity101 , right , said cheap alcohol contributes to ' harmful levels of drinking ' while @entity59 , of the @entity58 , said the plan would create ' market distortions ' in contrast , 72 per cent of the units in lager sold in shops , 70 per cent of the units in spirits and 46 per cent of units in table wine cost less than 45p and will therefore be affected			1
they found that if no one changes their habits in response to the price rises , the minimum price will simply transfer £ 1.4billion from consumers to off - licences and supermarkets			1
@entity125 , of the wine and @entity127 , said : ‘ minimum unit pricing and the proposed restrictions to promotions are wholly untargeted and will unfairly punish millions of consumers and businesses in the @entity71 , while doing nothing to tackle the root causes of alcohol misuse or associated crime and disorder			2
‘ alcohol misuse is a serious and complex problem for a small number of people in this country			2
’ the report confirms that low - income families will see the largest increases in prices , because they are most likely to buy cheap alcohol			2
and they say there is no evidence the plan will actually reduce harmful drinking			0
‘ the most important issue in determining the impact of minimum pricing will be whether those who generate the greatest social harms from their consumption drink less as a result of the policy , ’ the report said			0
‘ that will depend on how well targeted on those drinkers a minimum price is , and how their consumption responds to price rises - something we know relatively little about			0
’ ministers claim a minimum price will save hundreds of lives every year , and save the taxpayer millions of pounds a year by cutting crime and health problems linked to binge drinking			0
@entity10 minister @entity101 told @entity173 ’s today programme : ‘ the evidence is clear - the availability of cheap alcohol contributes to harmful levels of drinking			0
it ca n’t be right that it is possible to purchase a can of beer for as little as 20p			0
‘ too many of us have seen city centres on a friday and saturday night often become a vision of hell			0
a lot of this is fuelled by very cheap , very strong alcohol			0
