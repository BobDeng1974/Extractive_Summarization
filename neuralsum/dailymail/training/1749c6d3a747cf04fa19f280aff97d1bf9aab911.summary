by @entity0 published : 17:13 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 05:19 est , 25 january 2014 although he is only 5ft 3in and his younger , blonde second wife towers over him , @entity2 is an imposing man with a slightly menacing energy			2
at the @entity8 this week , the 58 - year - old creator and star of @entity7 , was in full - faintly terrifying - flow			1
holding court backstage after winning the title of best comedy , he was happy to discuss the success of his show about a foul - mouthed @entity16 matriarch which the critics hated when first broadcast — but could n’t kill off			1
she was an extraordinary woman who started out as a nun and ended up as a politician ‘ i really do respect critics , ’ he said			1
‘ i know they ’ve got a job to do			2
but there ’ll always be a donkey telling the racehorse how he ’s doing in the race			2
’ then , in typical mrs @entity37 language , he added : ‘ you can criticise me all you like , but as long as you ’re writing little columns in @entity41 giveaway newspapers , f * * * off			1
’ with withering sarcasm he said he was just grateful that the critics at least always spelled the name of the show correctly			2
the reason for his ire ? one snooty broadsheet called the show , which features a cursing @entity2 in a wig and baggy cardigan as the eponymous character , ‘ the worst comedy ever made ’			1
@entity2 , who has made £ 16 million — and counting — from it , is n’t about to take such an insult lying down			2
this week , wearing a black bow tie and with his spectacles perched on his balding head , he became increasingly pugnacious as he attempted to explain the secrets of his success			2
his wife @entity61 — who plays his daughter on screen — grimaced expressively at his side in her grey sequined dress			2
beating @entity70 , @entity72 sitcom @entity66 and @entity67 , featuring @entity68 , to the best comedy prize was another honour for the show which has been decried as hopelessly vulgar and dated			1
but the @entity76 special pulled in the biggest audience on @entity78 — nine million viewers — and it ’s no surprise that it scooped its accolade this week as the awards are based on the public vote			1
at the @entity8 this week the 58 - year - old creator and star of mrs @entity86 , @entity23 ( pictured holding award ) , was in full - faintly terrifying - flow the @entity76 special of @entity7 pulled in the biggest audience on @entity78 - nine million viewers the success of the show is phenomenal			1
it has also won a @entity94 , versions have been made in @entity96 , @entity97 and the @entity98 and it ’s the most popular comedy show in @entity100			1
@entity2 is about to take the show on a three - month tour @entity103 , and revenues have been estimated at £ 8.5 million in that country alone			1
there are discussions about making a mrs @entity37 in @entity72 , too , although the bad language is apparently an issue			1
( the show ’s producer admits to 34 uses of a barely sanitised variant of the f - word in a 30 - minute show			1
) @entity2 wants to write a fourth series this year , and a movie spin - off is due for release in the summer			1
enormous amounts of dvds of the show have also been sold — figures for 2012 suggest 2.1 million			2
and there are the incredibly lucrative tours			2
the team are in the middle of the second one			2
as @entity2 exclaimed in wonder on wednesday night : ‘ 325,000 of them bought tickets			2
i ’m getting a yacht ! ’ so just who is @entity2 ? born in @entity134 , he was the youngest of 11 children			2
his father @entity136 was a carpenter , who built ‘ beds on the walls , like in submarines ’ for his huge @entity138 mother , the obvious inspiration for @entity7 , was an extraordinary woman who started out as a nun and ended up as a politician			1
x-rated : mrs @entity7 is well - known for its slightly salty brand of comedy unlike @entity7 , she was highly educated			1
@entity151 attended @entity152 , @entity153 , and became a novice nun before she renounced her vows , married and became a language teacher			1
upon her marriage in 1936 she was expected to give up her job because married women in @entity160 were not allowed to be civil servants			1
so she embarked on protests that got the law changed			2
she was the first female @entity164 mp , and went on to be the party ’s chief whip			2
@entity2 said : ‘ @entity160 at the time was in the @entity168 and it was actually legal for a husband to beat his wife with a stick , so long as the stick was n’t longer than his forearm			2
my mother helped change all that			0
’ she had nine children and also adopted a boy from reform school			0
aged 42 , she became ill with ‘ a growth ’ , which turned out to be a 9lbs 3oz boy she called @entity2			0
@entity22 was an outspoken woman who had no time for convention			0
despite an iq reputed to be a dizzy 156 , he left school aged 12 in 1968 while his mother was away on union business in @entity189			0
happy couple : @entity23 with his wife and @entity7 co-star @entity192 @entity2 worked as a waiter on and off for the next decade			1
he met and fell in love with the @entity195 when they were both 13			0
they were married in 1977			0
their first son , @entity2 , died a few days after being born			0
they went on to have three more children — @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			0
and the family needed welfare to survive as @entity2 drifted from one job to another — milkman , painter and decorator and then , publican			0
disaster struck when his partner in a @entity134 pub disappeared with the money			0
returning from a holiday in 1989 , @entity2 found that @entity218 had cleared out the pub. in the book @entity37 , by author @entity219 , @entity2 says that he was even arrested on suspicion of killing @entity218 , when he was found hanged			0
but @entity218 , who was gay , had contracted aids and had gone to @entity100 for a holiday before returning to his mother ’s house to hang himself			0
left with debts of £ 96,000 , @entity2 was declared bankrupt			0
he said later : ‘ i was finished			0
at that stage , if you ’d put my name into the computer , you ’d have sworn that i ’d murdered the bank manager ’s wife , the credit rating was so bad			0
’ desperate for money , @entity2 started to work in pubs and clubs as a stand - up comedian			1
in 1992 he wrote a radio sitcom called @entity7 which was broadcast daily on the @entity16 station @entity239			1
then , an appearance on the @entity134 chat - show the @entity242 the following year raised his profile			1
the host of that show , @entity246 , says : ‘ he had the audience crying with laughter			0
he ’s also a very sharp businessman			0
the fact he has got the @entity78 to allow him to retain complete ownership over @entity7 shows what a smart operator he is			1
’ @entity2 followed up his success as a stand - up by writing a novel , @entity256 , about working class matriarch @entity7 , and followed it with three sequels			1
but in 1998 , when he wrote a film , @entity261 , and directed it , funding was withdrawn , and he was left with a debt of £ 2 million			0
a @entity264 film of @entity256 , starring @entity265 , helped to nudge him towards solvency in 1999 but it was only when he wrote a play about @entity7 that he managed to get back into the black			1
by this time he had split from @entity270 and fallen for @entity271 , who was in a play with him			0
@entity2 told his biographer his first wife was suspicious of showbusiness and preferred to take her mother to bingo than go to his first nights			0
one unusual feature is that @entity7 leaves in footage of the cast making mistakes and then laughing around this time he started to play mrs @entity37 , when an actress hired to play the part called in @entity285 sat down at a dressing - room mirror , put on a wig , pencilled in a mole on his chin — then declared , ‘ f * * * me , it ’s me mammy ! ’ the show remains a family affair , with his son , daughters - in - law and former agent all taking parts in it			1
one of its unusual features is that @entity7 leaves in footage of the cast making mistakes and then laughing			1
in the first broadcast episode , @entity2 turns to the studio audience and announces : ‘ it ’s just a man in a f * * * * * * dress			0
’ vulgar and old fashioned ? certainly			0
but so successful that @entity2 lives in some style in @entity311 , where he writes @entity7			1
his most recently filed accounts show touring profits for 2011 - 2012 at £ 880,000 — and that ’s after @entity2 took a dividend of £ 345,000			1
( they also show considerable charitable donations — he supports a @entity319 charity that tackles poverty and an autism charity			0
) his ventures are expected to eventually net him £ 50 million			0
though he often sports a moustache offscreen , he is stopped in the street and asked for photographs			0
@entity2 sighs : ‘ i do n’t even think my mother if she was alive would want a f * * * * * * photograph of me			0
’ and the secret of his success ? sometimes he credits the long years of working with mrs @entity37 on radio and stage with allowing him to know which jokes work			1
but at other times he just shrugs			0
he told his biographer : ‘ @entity219 , do me a favour			0
analyse this and tell me what the secret is , ‘ cos i do n’t have a f * * * * * * clue			0
