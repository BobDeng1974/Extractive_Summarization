by @entity0 @entity1 looked very put together on tuesday , the day after it was announced she chose former baseball player @entity3 as her fiancé on @entity6 's hit reality series @entity7			1
the 27 - year - old lawyer glowed as she showed off her diamond @entity11 engagement ring to @entity12 on @entity13			1
her good spirits were impressive considering less than 12 hours earlier in @entity16 , the brunette beauty suffered a major embarrassment when the runner up @entity18 told the audience at the after @entity22 ceremony that they had ' made love ' in the @entity24			1
' first of all , i think that 's kind of below the belt and something that should be kept private , ' she offered			2
' the things i told you were real			2
the way i kissed you , those things were real			0
' sales account executive @entity18 also claimed he was ' completely blindsided ' by the attorney 's rejection			1
' it 's hard to misread some [ little things ] , ' he said			2
' a lot of that stuff off camera … [ like ] when you tell someone you love them and they say " i wish i could say things back " – you 're not supposed to assume things , but there 's not much room for interpretation			2
' the looker also addressed @entity67 's bold admission - he is the first contestant who has shared on @entity69 that he got between the sheets in the @entity24 - while on @entity71 earlier in the day			1
not a bad time in her life : the attorney said she was enjoying being engaged and being able to talk about it as she sat down with @entity12 and @entity76 @entity1 , you lit me up			1
you made me feel those things that people go a lifetime to find , and i feel like i made you feel the same			0
i truly hoped we would have made it into the real world , where there would be no arbitrary deadline , where those stresses that came with that environment would have melted away , where we could have had the goofy , fun , exciting relationship that i know we could have			0
what we had was real to me , and it was amazing			0
i fully realize that in the end i could have been wrong about what we had			0
while it ’s hard to accept , i totally realize that it 's a possibility			2
with that being said , when i think about the relationship that we had , very few things in my life have felt more real … i think about that moment when you ended things and what you said to me			0
i believe you when you said something did n’t feel right with us when you woke up that morning , but i wonder if what did n’t feel right was really about us and our relationship			2
i wonder if it would have been different if that night you thought about us with your heart and not with your head			0
let ’s just call it what it was -- our relationship was very much the road less traveled			0
i totally get that all the passion , intensity , and connections that we had were accompanied by fear and sometimes discomfort			0
there is a reason why very few are willing to take the road less traveled			0
it can be scary , challenging , and risky , but if you have the courage to take it , it usually ends up being amazing			0
' that 's always the tough part , ' @entity1 said			1
' that 's kind of the nature of the beast with the show			1
i had to break up with 24 guys in order to get the one i really wanted and needed			0
' it 's always a little uncomfortable when you have to watch the breakups and talk about them			1
' @entity18 also wrote a letter to @entity1 which was posted on the @entity145			1
he discussed how he hoped they ' would have made it into the real world ' and said there may have been ' fear and discomfort ' that came with their ' passion			0
' he added , ' what we had was real to me , and it was amazing			0
' @entity18 finished with , ' there is a reason why very few are willing to take the road less traveled			1
it can be scary , challenging , and risky , but if you have the courage to take it , it usually ends up being amazing			0
' ' there 's really not much to talk about , ' @entity1 said on @entity71			1
' it 's obviously something i read , but i 'm very happy in my relationship			2
it 's like reopening the past that does n't need to be reopened			2
' but the reality princess - who held hands with her 29 - year - old fiancé as they walked on the set of @entity71 - soon changed the subject back to her happy news			1
she told host @entity178 : ' i definitely knew there was that chemistry and attraction with him , ' @entity1 declared of her future husband			1
' i 'm definitely an overthinker , though , so it took me till the very end			0
but there was something special with him			0
' she also discussed her wedding			0
' we would like to do something in the spring , ' she allowed			2
not an easy talk : the brunette beauty on after the @entity22 on monday with runner - up @entity18 in poor taste ? : @entity18 shared that he had ' made love ' to @entity1 in the @entity24 ; she was not happy with his comment ' i think for now , it 's like , i finally got the engagement ring , i 'm just going to enjoy this for a little while … just enjoy engagement life ! ' and what a ring it is			1
the @entity211 creation has a center stone that consists of three carats with 154 round diamonds surrounding it			1
the jeweler told people on monday , ' @entity3 wanted to get a pretty , feminine , soft - shaped ring , with a bit of glamor and wow effect			1
when @entity3 saw it , he knew this was the one			1
he said he could see it on @entity1			1
he could see himself proposing with it			0
' he dropped to one knee : the @entity229 native proposed to the @entity6 star and she seemed shocked as she cupped her hands to her mouth that 's a yes : the tv star accepted the proposal and sealed the engagement with a kiss on the lips nice ice : though the ring could be seen on monday 's episode of @entity7 , it did n't get its chance to sparkle until @entity1 showed it off the next day in @entity245 @entity3 also opened his heart on the news show			1
' i knew she was very intelligent , but she is so funny , ' he said			0
i was intimidated when i first got out of that limo , for sure			0
' the two have already gone to their social media accounts to gush about each other			0
@entity253 : @entity1 wore a flirty gold skirt , black tank top and gold heels as she walked out of their @entity71 taping on tuesday ' finally able to shout it from the rooftops ! ! ' @entity1 captioned an @entity261 shot of herself with her love			1
' amazing season , amazing guy ! one lucky girl			0
i love you more than you will ever know @ joshmurray11 # thebachelorette			0
' ' meet my beautiful fiancé and the love of my life @ andi_dorfman , ' @entity3 wrote			1

her third glam outfit of the day : @entity1 was also seen in a red romper and beige heels as she clung to her beau they ca n't stop smiling : the pair seemed more than thrilled to be able to shared their affection in public as they were seen hand in hand leaving a building in @entity295 before their appearance : the future @entity299 and mrs @entity300 wore casual clothing after they flew in from @entity16 to make the rounds on the chat shows in @entity245			1
