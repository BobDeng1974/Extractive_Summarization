the son of a @entity2 taxi driver is on his bike			2
@entity4 became the first @entity6 man to exit @entity7 , stumbling in straight sets to @entity9			1
in credit to the @entity6 no 3 , he initially put up a respectable fight against the 17th seed , but ultimately the quality of the @entity15 ’s groundstrokes proved too significant and he fell 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1			1
in each of the first two sets @entity4 set a trend of dragging points into long rallies , but lacked the guile to finish points			1
frustrated : @entity6 no 3 @entity4 was outclassed by his @entity15 opponent stroll : @entity9 crushed @entity4 in straight sets on the opening day of @entity7 @entity9 suffered no such issue and , having forced break points in @entity4 ’s opening service game , broke twice in the first set			1
his backhand , either sliced or with power , was brilliant			2
@entity4 was still in the fight in the second , imploring the crowd to offer some assistance , but he was again broken twice , the first at 2 - 3 down coming via a double fault			1
he gave away another break , and with it the set , with a long forehand from the middle of the court			2
@entity9 proceeded to run away with the third			1
the disappointment for @entity4 , quite aside from exiting in the first round for the fourth time in five attempts , will have been his failure to significantly threaten the @entity15 ’s serve			1
he forced only three break points and converted none , despite hitting the same number of winners ( 24 ) as the man ranked 137 places higher			2
by contrast , @entity9 took six of his 14 chances and wrapped up the match in one hour and 45 minutes			1
out : @entity4 had no answer to his opponent as he went down without a fuss @entity4 said : ' i thought he played very well , executed his game			1
i obviously did n't play as well as i 'd hoped			2
i have to go away and look at the tape and see what happened			0
it 's not enjoyable watching matches that you lose			0
but it 's all part of the process			0
it needs to be done			0
' as i say , he played very well			0
at different times in the match where i had a few half chances , he came up with the goods			0
' @entity4 pocketed £ 27,000 for his first - round exit - up from £ 23,500 for first - round losers in 2013 - and said the money is vital to his continued status as a tour player			1
he added : ' there 's 150 , 200 guys out there who are all playing the same tournaments week in , week out			0
if you have a coach or a trainer around you , obviously it becomes expensive to travel the world , different country every week			0
' but , it 's a massive help			0
i 'm very grateful for the help i 've always received from the @entity96 and the @entity97			0
without that i would n't be able to carry on playing probably			0

@entity4 is the first @entity6 man to be knocked out of @entity7
@entity6 no 3 lost in straight sets 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1
@entity9 is the 17th seed at @entity105
