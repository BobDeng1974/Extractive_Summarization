@entity0 made threats to the @entity2 before the row over the @entity5 ’s controversial undercover film went public			1
the dictatorship warned that the ten students who visited its capital with @entity10 journalists would be exposed if the documentary were broadcast			1
in a letter to the @entity5 , the university then made plain its anger , arguing that the students had been put in danger and had not been properly informed about the risks			2
but the @entity18 flatly rejected the demands not to broadcast , insisting that the students were told about the plans			2
the programme aired as planned last monday and was watched by 5.1 million people			2
controversy : panorama reporter @entity25 with a @entity0 colonel			0
@entity25 travelled to the country with students from the @entity2 , which was reportedly threatened by @entity29 before the programme aired an @entity2 spokesman denied yesterday that its protest was motivated only by the threats to publish the students ’ passport details			1
the @entity37 has learned that several days before the row surfaced , the university was contacted by a @entity40 , @entity41			1
mr @entity41 , a @entity42 , spends six months a year in @entity29 , where he has close ties with senior figures in the dictatorship			0
he hosts foreign delegations and acts as an intermediary for external parties wanting to invest , make documentaries or simply visit the country			2
the rest of the year he acts as a roving ambassador , making media appearances and effectively acting as a government spokesman			2
in an email to the @entity5 on april 9 , he said he was ‘ in communication with @entity2 representatives regarding the abuse of the name of their institution and other students ’			1
he warned that broadcasting the programme would leave him no choice but to ‘ expose all the real story and data ’			0
in the fall - out from the affair , six of the ten students turned on the university , claiming that it has placed them in greater danger than the trip itself			0
they complained that the decision to speak publicly about the expedition , led by the @entity10 presenter @entity25 , had exposed them to threats from @entity29			0
in an open letter to @entity2 director @entity83 and chairman @entity84 , the students said : ‘ we feel that we have now been put in more risk than was originally the case , as a result of the @entity2 ’s decision to go public with their story			1
’ the students said they were told in @entity92 that a journalist would accompany them and that they risked deportation or detention if the true purpose of the trip were uncovered			0
in @entity98 , before they flew to @entity29 , they were informed that @entity25 was the journalist and that he worked for the @entity5			0
dangerous : @entity0 leader @entity99 has ramped up tensions in recent weeks , threatening to launch a nuclear war but responding to the students ’ letter , the @entity2 ’s director of external relations , @entity102 , said : ‘ all ten of you were deliberately deceived , by the @entity5 ’s own admission			1
you were n’t in a position to give informed consent			0
‘ and it is n’t just about you			0
what the @entity5 have done has had implications for not just the whole @entity2 community , perhaps especially our academics , but for @entity2 as an institution and for independent academics more widely			1
‘ finally , we did not “ go public ”			0
the @entity5 put us in an impossible position			0
we knew that @entity2 would be publicly identified if any @entity2 students were recognisable on @entity10 ( several were )			1
and even if they were n’t , the @entity0 regime had threatened to reveal the details of all of you on the visit , and how the journalists gained entry to @entity0 by claiming to be @entity2 students or staff			1
