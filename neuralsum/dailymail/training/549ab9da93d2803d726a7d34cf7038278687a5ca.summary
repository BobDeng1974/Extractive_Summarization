with its arms outstretched , claws bared and mouth gaping open , this black tiger cub believes it is a fearsome sight - but the act is n't fooling anyone			2
the adorable 25 - day - old feline was photographed playfully rolling around on a red carpet in the city of @entity10 , in @entity12 province of east @entity13			1
during the photo - shoot , the cub was also pictured prancing around the room - with photos of cartoon animals , including a lion , adorning the walls			1
as a black tiger , it is not a unique subspecies - its unusual appearance is the result of pseudo-melanism			0
this occurs where the animal has a black or very dark grey pigmentation of their base coat with light tan or grey stripes			0
the thick stripes are so close together that they become barely visible - giving the appearance of one dark fur tone			2
what about now ? the cute feline tries out another pose during the photo - shoot in @entity10 , eastern @entity13 one for the cat - alogue : the cub is pictured in front of a wall of cartoon animals including a lion milk - nurse : the cub was even photographed cuddled up to a confused - looking dog as it fed from the animal sadly , it is thought that black tigers are actually becoming more common as a result of in - breeding - which causes weakening of healthy genetics			1
the term pseudo-melanism derives from pure melanism - where an animal has a large amount of black pigmentation of the fur and eyes			0
this gives it a completely black appearance and is the opposite of albinism			0
all - black : the cub is not a unique subspecies - its unusual appearance is the result of pseudo-melanism rare : its stripes are so close together they become barely visible - giving the appearance of one dark fur tone			1
