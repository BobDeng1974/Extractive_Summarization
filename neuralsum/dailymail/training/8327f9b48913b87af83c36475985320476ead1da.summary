a smart frying pan that helps you cook by telling you what to do and when has been released			1
called @entity4 the smart device uses a heat sensor to give you specific instructions on how to prepare food			1
it syncs up with your smartphone or smartwatch to give you alerts and reminders as to when you need to perform a task			1
the smart frying pan ( shown ) syncs up with phones to make cooking easier			1
it has a temperature sensor and wireless connectivity to send instructions and reminders to your smartphone or smartwatch the team behind the project , four former @entity29 of @entity30 ( @entity17 ) engineers from @entity18 , is currently seeking funding on @entity33			1
‘ now anyone can cook delicious meals perfectly , ’ they write			0
‘ the secret ingredient is temperature control			0
’ first , you ’ll need to open the app and choose what you want to cook			0
it will then give you steps to follow to get in the ingredients prepared			0
the app will tell you how hot the pan is , and how hot it should be for the meal you have selected			0
a graph with a red line ( actual temperature ) and target temperature ( green line ) helps you keep it at the right level			0
technology in the handle connects to your smartphone , and it will send you a reminder when you either need to do something with the food , or when it is done			2
it operates just like a regular pan on a hob but has some technology hidden safely inside			0
in the middle of the frying pan is a temperature sensor that communicates with an @entity68 app. this gives you constant reminders as your food cooks , telling you what to do and when to do it			1
most of the methodology revolves around time and temperature ; by knowing the temperature of the pan , the technology knows how long food needs to cook for			2
before you start cooking it asks for specifics about the food you intend to cook - such as the thickness of salmon - so it knows exactly how long to cook it for			2
this helps it keep track of the temperature and time required			0
and it will tell you when to flip or move your food so that it cooks evenly			2
using an app for your phone it will display a graph showing you the temperature of the pan			2
and when it is time for you to do something , or the food has finished cooking , it will send you a notification			2
the pan is non-stick while the handle , containing the technology that syncs with your chosen device , is made of commercial - grade thermoset plastic resin , the same material used for high - quality frying pan handles			1
‘ @entity4 helps you cook anything you can cook with a regular frying pan , only smarter , and perfect every time , ’ the team adds			1
there are dozens of recipes available in the app at the moment but there are apparently more on the way			0
the £ 159 ( $ 249 ) device is due to begin shipping in august next year			1
