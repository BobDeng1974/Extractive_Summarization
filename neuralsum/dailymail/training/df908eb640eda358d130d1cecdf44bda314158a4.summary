wreck : workers in the process of clearing the flooded @entity2 recovered eight cars from a drain			1
it is thought some of the vehicles may have been there for at least 20 years not the cause : although the eight cars were found in a flood drain less than 350 feet apart , @entity19 officials were quick to dismiss suggestions that the vehicles could have impacted on the flooding blockage : @entity38 spotted the old cars in @entity11 's @entity10 flood drain near @entity12 in @entity13 while clearing rivers that flooded during the heaviest january rainfall in 250 years loss : thousands were forced to abandon their homes during the flooding in @entity13 earlier this year			1
many parked vehicles were completely submerged by the rising waters @entity19 officers said that while it was unclear how the cars got into the drain , it was very unlikely they were swept in by recent flood water			1
some of the vehicles were more than 20 years old and their condition and the water wildlife inhabiting them suggests some could have been stuck in the drain for decades			1
@entity58 and @entity59 were called in relation to the discovery of the vehicles			0
@entity63 , from the @entity19 , said : ' some of them are over 20 - years - old , they certainly would not pass a @entity66			2
' ' they range from a @entity68 , to a @entity69 and a @entity70			0
the area around where the cars were located has a car parking area			0
' mystery : @entity19 officers said that while it was unclear how the cars got into the drain , it was very unlikely they were swept in by recent flood water the water channel is used to help drain the surrounding peat moors and is intended to bring some relief from flooding in the area before : this photograph was taken on the @entity2 in january and shows huge expanses of land under several feet of water and after : the same area seen three months later			1
millions of tonnes of water have been removed by enormous water pumps brought over from the @entity92 ' there is an access track there , so it is easily accessible should somebody want to do something underhand with a vehicle , ' mr @entity63 added			0
the cars were spotted after water levels in the area dropped significantly following the flooding			2

thanks to enormous water pumps from the @entity92 removing millions of tonnes of water from the land , large sections of the @entity2 are now dry			0
this has allowed long - awaited dredging to begin on silt - laden rivers in the area			0

the water channel is used to help drain the surrounding peat moors enormous water pumps from the @entity92 have been removing millions of tonnes of water ( pictured ) from land in @entity13 in recent weeks underway : the dredging is part of a £ 5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the @entity138 and @entity139 rivers			1
it got underway last monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by @entity142 the dredging is part of a £ 5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby tone and @entity139 rivers , with the project getting underway last monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by @entity142			2
the dredging project will see engineers remove tonnes of sediment from the rivers , which has built up since clearing stopped 18 years ago			2
it is hoped removing the sediment will increase the capacity of the rivers , which have been operating at just 60 per cent in places , and reduce the risk of them overflowing during the next period of heavy rainfall .			0

eight cars were recovered from a flood drain near @entity12 , @entity13
some of the vehicles thought to have been stuck for at least 20 years
