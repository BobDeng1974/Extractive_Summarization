a paedophile teacher filmed himself abusing girls in the classroom after school bosses failed over 14 years to act on 30 warnings about his behaviour			1
@entity6 , 51 , was described by a judge as a ‘ paedophile of the most sickening order ’ when he was jailed indefinitely last year for abusing five girls , some as young as six			1
yesterday a damning report showed that the primary school where he worked had catastrophically failed to protect the children in his care			1
he had abused children in the school ’s computer room , resource room , staff room and even during lessons with other pupils present			2
@entity6 also regularly filmed the pupils ’ harrowing ordeals using a camera provided by the school , storing hundreds of films on more than 20 memory sticks labelled with his victims ’ names			2
staff at @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 , first noticed @entity6 selecting girls who were ‘ less academically able , emotionally needy or pretty ’ as his ‘ favourites ’ a year after he started teaching there in 1996			1
sentence : @entity6 was given an indefinite jail term for his actions his inappropriate behaviour was so well known that staff tried to prevent children likely to become his ‘ star pupils ’ from being put into his year two and @entity55 classes			1
in 2004 , a mother claimed @entity6 had been taking pictures of her daughter with a mobile phone but he denied the accusation and no action was taken			2
four years later , two children told staff that @entity6 , a married father of two , had been touching their legs and kissing one of them – causing her to be sick – and a teacher twice reported him to the head			1
another member of staff saw @entity6 projecting an indecent image of an adult on to a wall during a lesson			0
@entity6 was also seen lifting up and groping young girls in the playground , tickling and cuddling pupils in class and sitting on cushions with a schoolgirl while visibly aroused			1
but those staff members who reported @entity6 ’s behaviour were told they should not ‘ insinuate things ’ and were bullied into silence , a report said yesterday			1
it was later discovered that @entity6 would routinely hide a camera under his desk and then summon his victims , recording the subsequent horrifying images of the abuse			0
in many of the videos , which are up to ten minutes in length , other children can be seen or heard in the background			0
when police finally became involved , @entity6 first denied wrongdoing but later admitted 36 sexual offences including rape , assault and voyeurism			1
yesterday a review by the @entity102 concluded that his appalling crimes could have been stopped much earlier if the school had not failed to act on the warnings			0
instead , out of 30 disturbing incidents noted , only 11 were mentioned to the school ’s headmaster , @entity107 , and none was passed on to an agency outside the school			0
abuse : @entity6 worked at @entity40 , in @entity113 , where staff complained but were ignored @entity6 was only arrested in december 2010 , when a schoolgirl told her mother he abused her ‘ every day apart from when the teaching assistant was in the classroom ’			1
police who raided the home he shared with his wife , also a teacher , found more than 30,000 images , including 61 pictures and 21 movies at level five , the most serious level			0
at least 20 children were victims of @entity6 ’s abuse or witnessed it at the school , which caters for 128 children aged between four and eight			2
three @entity135 inspections undertaken during the time @entity6 was abusing his students graded it as ‘ good ’ and a report in 2009 noted : ‘ pupils feel exceptionally safe and secure because they know that staff have their well - being at heart			2
’ @entity142 , who chaired the serious case review , said : ‘ there was a failure at every level within the school			0
‘ there was a culture which just did not empower people to voice their concerns			0
it could be interpreted as a culture of bullying			0
’ he said the headmaster had been sacked following a disciplinary process .			0
