@entity0 has defended himself against critics who labeled his first collection for @entity3 a ' disaster '			1
after @entity6 , the creator of @entity7 , told the @entity8 that she 's ' kind of over @entity0 ' and is ' not a fan of his music , and the attitude and the agenda are not [ her ] style , ' the 37 - year - old took to @entity14 last night to voice his own opinion in a rant that was later taken down , but has since been put back up			1
' to @entity6 , i just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult , ' he wrote in the first of a series of tweets			1
' and i have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way			2
' i do n't call myself a designer as i was not allowed to go to @entity49			2
because i was too famous by the time i realized i wanted to design			2
' fame is often looked down upon in the design world , so it 's actually been something i had to overcome			0
all we have are our dreams , and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want , but we wo n't stop fighting			0
' we want to innovate and we will win someday			0
' the tweets were also directed at other fashion critics , like publicist @entity41 , who is known by many for her appearance on @entity66 's @entity65 - based reality series , @entity64			2
' i ’m not into his fashion thing , ' she told @entity69			0
' i think he ’s fine as a rapper			2
i think he ’s a joke as a fashion designer			0
' i just think that you should stay focused at what you ’re good at			0
just because you ’re a good rapper does n’t mean you ’re going to be a good fashion designer			2
' @entity0 's questionable fashion fail has already started to spawn its own collection of entertaining memes , including this one which features designer @entity83 @entity41 was also quick to point out that this is not the first time @entity0 's attempts to establish himself as a legitimate designer have failed			1
' i mean , it ’s not , he ’s not legit			0
have you seen the product ? ' she said			0
' did n't he have his own line in @entity92 , which was a disaster that he spent $ 10 million to do , that no one wore ? ' plenty of would - be fashion critics on @entity14 also shared @entity41 's somewhat blunt opinion of @entity0 's @entity3 collection , which featured a series of skin - tight nude body stockings which were paired with flesh - colored crop tops			1
' i 'm no fashion guru but i feel like @entity0 is the 2015 version of " the emperor 's new clothes			1
" ' one @entity14 user wrote , while another added : ' i ca n't believe people are actually buying ripped clothing just bc [ sic ] @entity0 designed them			1
@entity110 give me your clothes & i 'll rip them for free			0
' despite claiming to be incredibly excited at the prospect of showing his @entity3 collection , @entity0 failed to raise a smile when he took to the catwalk the collection included a number of unflattering ensembles , which featured skin - tight body stockings and barely - there crop tops @entity41 labeled @entity0 's collection , pictured , as a ' joke ' and a ' disaster ' @entity0 's show was attended by a whole host of his celebrity friends , including his wife @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , who wore one of his designs , and @entity134 editor - in - chief @entity133 yeezy x @entity136 get army chic ! visit site it should have been all about the models on the catwalk but naturally @entity0 ensured his wife ( and muse ) @entity129 was the best dressed at his @entity3 fashion show yesterday			1
we 're not used to seeing miss @entity146 in anything but form fitting designer duds , but we 're really loving this loose look on her			0
that @entity151 oversized jacket is everything ! unfortunately it 's not available to buy just yet though			0
the reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990 's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of @entity158 camouflage pants just the other day			1
take a page from @entity129 's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below			0
both @entity165 and @entity166 make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a @entity171 jacket on sale for only $ 73.95 ! our favorite item here at @entity175 is a @entity177 's mixed media camo bomber , which at $ 140.00 is also a style steal			0
rothco the @entity178 at @entity179 ( now $ 73.95 ) visit site @entity181 at @entity182 visit site @entity184 at @entity185 visit site @entity187 at @entity188 visit site @entity0 's questionable fashion fail has also started to spawn its own collection of ironic memes on social media , with one image of him and designer @entity83 , which was taken at the @entity83 show on thursday morning , proving particularly popular			1
the picture , which shows @entity83 showing affection towards @entity0 , alongside the words ' @entity199 try kid but leave the fashion to me ' , has already been shared hundreds of times on @entity14 , with fans labeling it as ' brilliant ' and ' hysterical '			1
thankfully , it seems that @entity0 will always find a fan in his wife , @entity129 , who actually wore one of her husband 's skin - tight ensembles to attend his show			1
alongside an image of herself wearing the spandex design , she wrote on her @entity218 account : ' so proud of my baby ! ! ! ! this moment is here ! ! ! he has worked so hard on this collection ! ! ! '			2

the 37 - year - old rapper showed his first collection for @entity3 , at @entity7 on friday
@entity6 *revealed* that she is ' over ' @entity0 - and his music
@entity0 hit back on @entity14 , writing : ' to @entity6 , i just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult '
