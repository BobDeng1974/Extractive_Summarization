@entity0 hopes to begin testing a new version of @entity2 by the end of the year , according to the company ’s chief executive			1
its previous plane was destroyed in a crash in the @entity8 in october 2014			1
the company said it is planning to use lessons learned from the crash to ensure that the new spacecraft works ‘ better ’			2
he said it could begin test flights by the end of this year			1
its predecessor was destroyed in the @entity8 on 31 october 2014			1
co-pilot @entity21 was killed and pilot @entity22 was injured the comments were made by chief executive @entity14 at the annual @entity24 in @entity25 , reported the @entity26			1
‘ the first message that i wanted to communicate is that we are moving forward well , ’ mr @entity14 told the audience			1
‘ the team is doing great and has turned a corner - that is the second spaceship			0
’ ticket cost : the starting price for flights is £ 150,000 ( $ 250,000 )			2
the first will be by @entity37 and his family			0
training : passengers are required to go through a ' @entity40 ' , including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly			0
once aboard : @entity2 will carry six passengers and two pilots			0
each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead			0
flight path : a climb to 50,000ft ( 15,000 metres ) before the rocket engine ignites and @entity2 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity53 ii. passengers become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity59 line 62 miles ( 100km ) up			0
@entity0 has not named this vehicle yet			0
the first was called @entity61			0
construction on the spacecraft began in 2012 , as @entity0 always planned to have more than one craft			2
' @entity67 is now 75 per cent complete , and we are on track to start the vehicle ’s test program this year , ' a spokesperson from the company told @entity72			1
' this programme includes both ground and flight tests , the exact timing of which will be dictated by safety and readiness rather than deadlines			0
' the previous @entity2 was destroyed on 31 october 2014 when co-pilot @entity21 accidentally pulled a lever that activated the craft ’s ‘ feathering system ’			1
this is used to help the vehicle slow down and return from space - but deploying it at the wrong moment caused the spacecraft to disintegrate			2
@entity21 was killed in the resultant crash , while pilot @entity22 was seriously injured - but somehow survived when he was thrown clear of the cockpit in his seat			1
while the fault appears to have been down to human error - and not a mechanical fault - the @entity97 is yet to publish its report on the crash			0
the first @entity2 spacecraft , @entity101 ( pictured ) , was destroyed when co-pilot @entity21 accidentally pulled a level that activated the craft ’s ‘ feathering system ’ at high speeds			1
deploying it at the wrong moment caused the spacecraft to disintegrate ‘ the team is doing great and has turned a corner - that is the second spaceship , ' said chief executive @entity14 , left			1
@entity37 , right , has previously spoken of his desire to push forward while the crash of @entity101 ( shown ) appears to have been down to human error - and not mechanical - the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) is yet to publish its report debris was scattered across the @entity8 following the crash			2
although @entity21 was killed , @entity22 was able to somehow survive when his seat was thrown clear of the disintegrating cockpit one issue is that spacecraft are normally required to be capable of handling two errors			1
but in this case only one - the pulling of the lever - was enough to cause a catastrophic failure			0
mr @entity14 was confident , though , that the company could overcome the disaster			2
‘ i think , ultimately , we will have a better spaceship for it , ’ he said , adding that they still had ‘ roughly 700 [ customers ] who are eager to fly			0
’ celebrities among the 700 who have tickets include @entity136 ( left ) and @entity137 ( right ) while @entity2 was destroyed , the @entity53 plane carrying it - shown - remained intact , and will likely be used again for the successor			0

chief executive @entity14 says new spacecraft is nearly ready
he said it could begin test flights by the end of this year
