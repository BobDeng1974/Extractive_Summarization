battle : @entity1 , 80 , is in a dispute with council officers over a ramp he wants outside his house a disabled war veteran has been housebound since january as he fights a battle with council chiefs to install a ramp outside his bungalow			1
@entity1 , 80 , was left struggling to walk down his outdoor steps after a heart attack and stroke - but was repeatedly turned down for the ramp because he was using a walking frame			1
that meant a mobility scooter which friends from the @entity19 had bought him lay unused in a garage , because there was no way to get it down the stairs			1
it is now ten months since he last made it unaided to the town centre in @entity28 , @entity29 , just a few hundred yards away			1
mr @entity1 , who served with the @entity30 in @entity31 for six years and as a reservist for nine years , claimed he was marooned by council bureaucracy			2
he kept pushing @entity34 , who he first contacted in february , and was eventually able to lodge a formal application to fund the ramp in july			1
he had to sit on a four - month waiting list before he was finally seen last week			2
his bid was approved - though the funds are not yet confirmed , and he claims he was told in the latest visit this week : ' do n't hold your breath for another eight months '			2
mr @entity1 said : ' i have n't been into @entity45 since january			2
i 'm on my own and i ca n't get the scooter in or out			0
' i 'm getting a bit fed up to be honest			0
it takes me about an hour to walk half the length of a football pitch and i need to rest every so often due to medical conditions			1
' when i asked social services how i was expected to get out of the house to do my shopping i was told to get a taxi			0
i then asked them what i 'd do once i got into town and they said i should just find a seat			0
mr @entity1 , pictured left with a mobility scooter from the @entity19 that has gone unused , and right , in 1975 when he was attached to the @entity62 ' i just want to put my coat on and go out for a bottle of milk , or some crisps , or a newspaper			1
i would like to do it myself			0
' @entity69 , chairman of the @entity28 branch of the @entity19 , said mr @entity1 had been in contact with @entity34 since the start of the year			1
members clubbed together and gave the veteran a mobility scooter in february , but it has languished in another member 's garage because there was no way to use it			1
but a council spokesman insisted officials did not know the mobility scooter existed until last week , when it was moved for storage inside mr @entity1 's house			1
mr @entity1 could make it to the top of these steps but no further - and has not been out alone for months @entity19 branch chairman @entity69 said : ' when @entity1 's been phoning these departments he 's been bounced from one to another and no one 's given him a clear and concise decision ' mr @entity69 said : ' @entity1 's a very proud man and despite being able to get around his home he just does n't have the strength to get down the steps either side of his house and into town to do the things we take for granted ... it 's disgusting			1
' when @entity1 's been phoning these departments he 's been bounced from one to another and no one 's given him a clear and concise decision			2
' @entity1 receives help from carers and his family but it 's just not the same as being able to do things for yourself			0
' a @entity34 spokesman said mr @entity1 first asked for a ramp on february 25 , but was declined because he was using a walking frame , which a ramp can make more dangerous			1
war veteran mr @entity1 , pictured left and right in 1975 , has served with the @entity30 in @entity31 for six years and as a reservist for nine years he was seen again in april and given a wheelchair in which friends could push him around , but again , ' a ramp was not thought to be appropriate '			2
a social worker then visited him on may 25 , but his request was declined for a third time			0
the spokesman added : ' in july he was put forward for assessment			0
due to a lengthy waiting list , he was assessed on november 11 and it was agreed that , subject to the outcome of a visit this week , we would recommend a ramp be provided			0
' the spokesman insisted officers had no knowledge of the mobility scooter until last week			2
the final stages are being considered by @entity136			0
housing manager @entity137 said : ' when @entity136 receives the formal assessment we will ensure that a means test is completed to ensure financial eligibility			0
' it is important that every case is treated on its merits and the specific needs of the applicant are taken into account			0
' @entity148 , conservative mp for @entity149 said : ' it is disappointing that mr @entity1 has been let down by @entity34 's @entity151			0
' it is unacceptable that a war veteran has lost his independence as he tries to recover			0
' i hope that the ramp can finally be installed soon and mr @entity1 can then use the scooter the @entity19 have provided him with - a further example of the great work they do for our veterans			1

@entity1 in long battle with authorities over home in @entity28 , @entity29
veteran was told ramp would be unlikely as he was using walking frame
so a @entity19 gift of mobility scooter sat unused in garage
' it takes me an hour to walk half the length of a football pitch ' , he said
formal application finally made in july - and was approved last week
