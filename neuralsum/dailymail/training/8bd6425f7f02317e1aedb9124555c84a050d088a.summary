by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:03 est , 17 february 2014 ‘ why do i drink ? ’ is a question many students probably ask themselves the morning after a heavy night out			2
and now one university has spent £ 20,000 creating a pub laboratory in a bid to unlock the secrets of people 's drinking habits and why they overindulge			1
hidden cameras and microphones will monitor students ’ behaviour as they guzzle a free drink - or five			1
cheers ! @entity18 has spent £ 20,000 creating a pub laboratory ( pictured ) in a bid to unlock the secrets of people 's drinking habits and why they overindulge people who are drunk and anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to @entity23 , according to a 2013 study			1
@entity25 , from the @entity26 surveyed more than 225 students about their perceived levels of loneliness , anxiousness , alcohol use and marijuana use			0
he found that students who reported higher levels of anxiousness and alcohol use were more emotionally connected to @entity23 and to the social connections it facilitates			0
mr @entity25 also discovered that students who had higher levels of anxiety and loneliness were more likely to use @entity23 as a platform to connect with others			0
he added that because alcohol use is generally viewed as normative , or socially acceptable , among college students , increased alcohol use may cause an increase in emotional connectedness to @entity23			0
there is a serious side to the study at @entity18 as the lavish experiment is designed to study consumer behaviour and could ultimately help experts work out a way to encourage people to drink more responsibly			1
the ' pub lab ' will initially look into how much people choose to drink and how people take more risks as they consume more alcohol			1
volunteers will be given free drinks but there is a catch – some the beer and glasses of wine on offer will be alcohol free but smell of ethanol			1
the pub lab looks like the real deal and even has a fruit machine			2
it is designed to be a realistic setting to investigate the ‘ factors that motivate people ’s drinking ’ as real pubs in the outside world have too many distractions - making findings often inaccurate			2
free drinks with a side order of science : hidden cameras and microphones will monitor students ¿ behaviour in the pub lab ( pictured ) as they guzzle in a free drink - or five			1
they will be breathalyzed too the university said the experiment is ‘ relatively low cost ’ and is ‘ extraordinarily useful ’			0
dr @entity94 , head of psychology at the university told @entity96 : ‘ a lot of the early work we have been doing is n’t so much interested in the effects of alcohol once people are intoxicated , but trying to understand factors that motivate people to drink in certain ways – particularly how they initiate a night out when they are drinking			0
’ ‘ of course , there are studies we do which involve administering alcohol to people , so that we can see what happens later on , ’ he added			0
@entity111 , a psychology masters student at the university said that offering free drinks is a successful technique to get other students to help out with a scientific study			1
‘ we all drink a lot , so you can see the findings in your day - to - day life , ’ she said			0
the research will study consumer behaviour and could ultimately help experts work out a way to encourage people to drink more responsibly - unlike these students ( stock image )			2

@entity18 has spent £ 20,000 creating the pub lab serving free drinks to students
hidden cameras and microphones will monitor students ’ behaviour as they guzzle drinks - some of which do not contain alcohol but smell like they do
the pub lab will initially look at how much people choose to drink and how they take more risks as they consume more alcohol
