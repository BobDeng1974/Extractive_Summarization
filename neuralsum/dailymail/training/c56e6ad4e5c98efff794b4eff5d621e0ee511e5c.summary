by @entity0 for @entity1 a solitary , strangely - shaped building known by locals as the ' doughnut ' is all that will ever exist of what the @entity5 hoped would become an ambitious ' @entity7 ' in @entity8			1
the @entity9 has cancelled the 500 million - euro project with just one building erected , due to lack of funding			1
around 19 million euros had already been invested in the plan , which is the latest in a number of @entity5 projects forced to be cancelled because of the financial crisis			0
the doughnut - more officially known as the @entity18 - is now nothing but an abandoned reminder , and has a sign outside banning people from entering			0
the sorry building site is beside @entity24 , and also close to the @entity26 skyscrapers and @entity8 sport city			2
@entity5 was hit extremely hard by the recession , and this has resulted in a number of half - finished buildings being dotted around the country			0
they include the @entity35 skyscraper in @entity36 - a 47 - storey block of flats which was left without a lift - and the @entity39 - a 61,500 - seater football stadium designed to be the new home of @entity41 , where construction started in 2007 , but still sits unfinished			0
what a doughnut ! the @entity18 has accrued an unfortunate nickname from locals and now sits useless and abandoned no entry : there is a sign outside the building banning people other than construction workers from going in , as weeds build up outside all alone : the building was supposed to be the first stage of a proposed ' @entity7 ' - a project which would have cost 500 million euros what a waste of money : the project had to be abandoned for financial reasons after 19 million euros was already spent on getting it up and running now what ? the abandonment of the project has left a huge empty space in the @entity8 suburbs , and is one of many failed building ideas in @entity5 a meaningful sundown : the sun sets over the @entity18 and also on @entity5 's plans for an ambitious ' @entity7 ' the long road to nowhere : a solitary cyclist pedals along the road in front of where other buildings in the ' @entity7 ' were supposed to stand			1

@entity5 had planned for a 500 million - euro ' @entity7 ' to be built in *outskirts* of @entity8 beside @entity24
project had to be cancelled after *19million* spent and just one building erected - the @entity18
