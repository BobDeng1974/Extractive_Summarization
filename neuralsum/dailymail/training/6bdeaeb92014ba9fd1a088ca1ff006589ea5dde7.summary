women with cervical cancer in the @entity4 are less likely to be alive after five years than their counterparts in @entity15 and the @entity16 , a major international study found			1
our survival rates for breast and bowel cancer are also among the worst of the world ’s industrialised nations , according to the @entity22			1
its report found that even @entity25 has a lower mortality rate for cancers than the @entity4 – and that the @entity28 has fewer mri scans to detect cancers and other illnesses than almost any wealthy nation			1
and despite @entity34 ’s extra millions , far fewer women are being screened now for breast and bowel cancer than a decade ago			1
last night a cancer expert described @entity4 ’s position in the cancer league tables as a ‘ tragedy ’			2
the study shows that the @entity4 is also at @entity8 levels on stroke survival – worse than the @entity16			2
all these factors add up to make @entity4 ’ life expectancy at birth among the lowest in @entity47 , and for women it is even lower than @entity15			2
professor @entity50 , former chief of the @entity52 ’s cancer programme , said last night : ‘ we are improving but at nothing like the rate of the rest of @entity8 – we are not catching up at all			0
‘ in @entity4 there are lots of delays in the system			0
we need to speed up the whole process			0
a cell from human breast cancer tissue : survival rates for breast and bowel cancer in the @entity4 are also among the worst of the world 's industrialised nations ‘ in @entity73 , when there is a concern the blood tests , the scans and so forth would all be done in a week – here you might still be trying to get an appointment with your gp			1
' a lot of this is about late diagnosis – gps missing cancer or patients not being seen quickly enough once they are referred			0
‘ it is a really sad indictment of the priority we give to cancer … if we just met the average of the rest of the @entity8 league tables we could save 10,000 lives a year			0
’ the @entity22 report is the most comprehensive analysis of health spending and outcomes across richer nations			0
while there is some good news for @entity4 – our suicide rate is one of the lowest and only @entity99 has fewer road fatalities – most of it makes grim reading			0
@entity103 , of @entity104 , said : ‘ it is simply unacceptable that cancer survival rates in the @entity4 continue to lag behind those in the rest of @entity8 , and these latest figures are very disappointing			1
' clearly more needs to be done to encourage better screening attendance and early diagnosis			0
