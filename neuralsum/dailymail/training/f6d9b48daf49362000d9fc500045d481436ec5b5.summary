by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:56 est , 20 february 2014 research : @entity4 has been developing her beauty products for more than three years many women dread the menopause and fear it may leave them feeling old and past their prime			1
it was a feeling skin therapist @entity4 , now 53 , experienced when she started undergoing the change			1
she said : ' around two years ago i started having various unfamiliar physical and emotional symptoms			0
hot flushes , sleepless nights and erratic periods were not things i was used to in my daily routine			0
at one stage it crossed my mind that i could be pregnant , and then my hypochondriac self , started to believe i might have some serious illness			0
' so i went to see my doctor who very calmly informed me , that i was in fact going through the menopause			0
my first reaction was - thank the lord i 'm not pregnant , my second was , what ! no , wait , surely this ca n't be happening yet			0
i 'm too young to be that old ! ' once she had gotten over the shock of being a ' certain age ' @entity36 , from @entity37 , fully researched the topic so she would be fully aware of the changes her body was going through and how she could aid the transition through diet and exercise			0
she shared her findings in a book published in 2012 called @entity46			0
during her research , one area where @entity36 found menopausal women were overlooked was in the skincare market			1
this concerned her as maintaining a youthful appearance and glowing skin can be key to helping a woman feel confident as she goes through the menopause			1
she told @entity56 : ' an issue that came to my attention during my menopause was the lack of specific skin care products to deal with my changing skin needs			1
there are many skin creams on the market but none specifically aimed at skin care concerns during menopause - they need to be rich in bio-hormones to replace lost oestrogen , which is the main cause of ageing during this time			1
' up to 30 per cent of collagen is lost in the first five years after menopause due to lack of oestrogen , resulting in wrinkles , dryness and pigmentation problems			0
' we have a high concentration of oestrogen receptors in the face and this is where the symptoms of the menopause may be at their most visible			0
i was concerned the products out there were not addressing these needs			0
' using her background in cosmetics and expertise as a skin therapist , @entity36 decided to develop her own products specifically designed for hormonally changing skin			1
anti-ageing : @entity91 costs £ 128 a bottle after three years , she is now ready to launch the first product from her @entity96 skin and spa therapy range			1
it 's called @entity91 and does n't come cheap at £ 128 a bottle			1
however it offers some value for money as a multi-purpose product - it can be used as a moisturiser , serum , eye cream and neck cream			1
the product is currently only available through the company 's online store but @entity36 is in talks with several cosmetics companies in the hope of getting it into @entity116 shops soon			1
the cream contains vitamins , minerals and essential oils to help rejuvenate skin and @entity123 filters to protect from ageing @entity125 rays			2
@entity36 explains : ' we wanted to start with a good base , which meant choosing oils for their rich plant hormone content , such as flaxseed , soya , grape - seed and wheat - germ			0
we then added wild yam , sage , aloe vera and geranium essential oil , all very popular ingredients used to treat menopause symptoms and vitamins b , @entity141 and e for skin repair			2
' we could have stopped here , and this would have been a very good moisturiser – but that is all it would have been , a moisturiser , the same as hundreds of different moisturisers out there @entity151 is more than a moisturiser – it ’s a treatment product			2
so , to this basic moisturiser , we added some very special actives , all specifically chosen and blended into the formulation very precisely to addresses the needs of hormonally changing skin			1
' beauty boost : @entity36 said the product meets the needs of women as their skin loses more collagen during the menopause in clinical trials , @entity36 reports that 95 per cent of women noticed a significant reduction in lines and wrinkles in just four weeks using the cream			1
and despite it being developed for menopausal women , she said women should n't wait for the onset of symptoms to use the product			1
the average age women in the @entity177 go through the menopause is 52 but some experience it much earlier			2
as a result , @entity36 said women could benefit from using it in their thirties			2
she explains : ' many women do n't realise that hormones can start to fluctuate as early as 35 , though they would not necessarily connect this to menopause at this age			2
' up until this time your skin has a plentiful supply of collagen , which is why you do n't see young people with wrinkles			2
after this age oestrogen starts to decline bringing with it the associated skin care concerns			0
so i would recommend women start using this cream from around this age			0
' @entity91 is currently available from http://phytomone.com for £ 128			0

@entity4 , now 53 , has developed new product
she said it 's first in skincare market specially for menopausal women
meets needs of their hormonally changing skin
