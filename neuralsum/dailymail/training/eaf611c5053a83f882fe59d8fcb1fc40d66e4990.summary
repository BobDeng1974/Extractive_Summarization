@entity0 has warned @entity2 ’s title rivals that he is armed with his most dangerous attacking unit for years			1
after his side thumped @entity5 3 - 0 in the @entity6 , @entity0 said : ‘ three , four , five years ago we lost a big player every year			1
in the last two years we ’ve added players , like @entity9 and @entity10			1
‘ i have more attacking options than i ’ve had for a long time			2
@entity0 added : ‘ last year we were very consistent against teams outside the top six and not consistent against top - six teams			2
the year before it was the reverse			0
it ’s hoped that this year it will be right on both sides			0
’ goals from @entity13 , @entity36 and @entity37 sealed victory and @entity0 said : ‘ to win today gives us a positive platform			1
you want to win the game and you want to look at the quality of the performance as well			0
it was important for our confidence to win the game and it was even more important to have a big part in the game with quality			0
that 's the way to kick the season off ! @entity13 leaps in the air after scoring in the @entity6 over him in a flash ! @entity54 could do nothing about @entity37 's stinging effort from distance here to stay : @entity37 points to the @entity2 badge after thundering home the third from difference ‘ it is a comfort to me to see the kind of quality we produced for some long patches in the game			1
’ sunday 's win at @entity21 came without @entity71 winners @entity9 , @entity72 and @entity73 , while @entity74 is set to return to full fitness at the end of next month following a serious knee injury			0
@entity0 , who confirmed @entity79 ’s story that @entity18 will captain the club following @entity82 ’s departure for @entity83 , is set to cool his search for a new centre back following the emergence of @entity87			1
the 19 - year - old made the breakthrough at @entity90 as a right back but , as @entity79 revealed last month , @entity0 sees @entity93 ’ long - term future at centre half			2
impressive : @entity87 performance could lead @entity0 away from signing a new centre - back the £ 16million man was excellent and @entity0 believes he is ready to challenge first - choice centre backs @entity99 , who sustained a slight achilles injury at @entity21 , and @entity72			1
the @entity101 are on the lookout for a new central defender to replace @entity82 following his £ 15m move to the @entity105			0
but @entity0 said : ‘ in my head @entity93 is among the best three centre backs i have			0
if i can find another one i will do it , but to find another one of that quality will not be easy			0

@entity0 says they used to lose players like @entity9 and @entity10
hails amount of attacking options at the club
@entity2 beat @entity5 3 - 0 in the @entity6 on sunday
@entity13 , @entity36 and @entity37 scored the goals
@entity0 hails @entity123 ' performance at centre - back
*admits* finding another defender of that quality will be *difficult*
