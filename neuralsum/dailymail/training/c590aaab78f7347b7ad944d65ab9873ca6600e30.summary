@entity0 may have hoped yesterday would be a change in fortunes for the struggling company			1
but if today ’s announcement is anything to go by , their competitors are not going down easily without a fight			0
in direct response to @entity0 revealing its ‘ blab ’ video messaging service , @entity8 fought back with an announcement of its own			1
@entity14 allows users to send videos directly to friends rather than posting them for all to see called ‘ @entity19 ’ , the new app will give @entity8 users the ability to send friends videos and text in private messages			1
this not only tackles @entity0 , but could also send shivers down the spine of popular messaging services such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
using @entity19 , available now on both @entity33 and @entity34 , users can either start one - to - one conversations or select multiple recipients , much like on @entity29			1
in a nod to @entity30 , they can also choose to only receive private messages from friends			1
@entity14 , like @entity40 , also allows users to send messages to people who do n’t have the app. as @entity0 enters the messaging war , this move should let them know how tough the battle will be with their rivals			1
picture perfect ? @entity48 lets users take a video ( left ) and send it to selected people ( right ) to reply to a message ( left ) users hold the camera button and send their response ( right ) the free @entity11 app , pictured , lets users record and send videos to friends , even if the recipient does n't have the @entity33 app after almost a year of teasers , social network @entity0 kickstarted it 's revival with the release of a video messaging app yesterday called @entity11 , the free service lets users record and send videos to friends , even if the recipient does n't have the @entity33 app. it is the first of three apps set to be released by the @entity74 - based social network this year , and signals that the once floundering firm is getting a reboot			1
the site itself is also going through a refresh and is set to relaunch ' soon '			0
@entity0 was once the most popular social network in the @entity81			2
but following the launch of rival sites such as @entity31 and @entity86 , its numbers dwindled and the site , as its users knew it , eventually closed down			0
at the height of its popularity in 2008 - three years after it was created - the site was bought by @entity94 for $ 850 million ( £ 510 million )			0
only five years later the site was trailing behind its rivals in terms of user numbers , and had developed a reputation for being supposedly rife with bullying			0
to save the company from going under in 2013 , its founder @entity101 bought his site back for a cut - price $ 1million ( £ 600,000 )			0
@entity101 posted a video shortly after saying it was time to ‘ wipe the slate clean ’ and promised its users the service would come back fighting			1
reports about the @entity11 app first appeared in february this year , and now the app is available on the @entity114			0
according to the app ’s listing : ‘ @entity40 is the fun app that lets you send quick video messages to your friends and family ! it ’s free to blab anyone , anywhere in the world			1
' to send a @entity11 , users select a contact , hold the screen to record their video message , and release to send , pictured left			2
if the recipient has the app , a notification appears on the app ’s icon			0
if they do n’t , the recipient receives the video in a text message with a link that opens the clip in a browser window the app connects with the contacts in a user ’s phone			2
to send a @entity11 , users select a contact , hold the screen to record their video message , and release to send			2
if the recipient has the app , a notification appears on the app ’s icon			0
if they do n’t , the recipient receives the video in a text message with a link that opens in a browser window			2
@entity8 and @entity162 in @entity163 work in a similar way , but the video clips can only be sent to other @entity8 and @entity163 users – although they can also be shared on other social networks			1
blab does n’t set a time limit on its videos either , like @entity8 ’s six - second and @entity163 ’s 15 - second rules			1
@entity40 has also taken its privacy lead from the likes of @entity30 and only lets users watch the last video they were sent			0
as soon as a new blab is received from that contact , the destroys the old one and replaces it			0
the current @entity0 website shows more than 780,000 people have signed up to be part of the ‘ new @entity0 ’			1
in a video , @entity101 promises users that all their posts and data is safe and will be available once the new site goes live , although does n't specify when that will be			0
the site still faces stiff competition from the likes of @entity31 , and the @entity11 app goes up against behemoths including @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity194			0
the other @entity0 apps are expected later this year , but the company has not yet revealed more information about what they will be			2
what 's clear , though , is that they will be facing stiff competition .			0

new *update* allows @entity8 users to send private messages
but the messages do n’t have to be video – they can just be text
others can receive the messages even if they ’re not on vine
announcement of ‘ @entity19 ’ comes a day after @entity0 revealed their ‘ blab ’ video messaging service
