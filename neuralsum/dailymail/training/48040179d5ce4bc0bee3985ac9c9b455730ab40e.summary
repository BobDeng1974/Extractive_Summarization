@entity0 , pictured on his first day , was well enough to start school three weeks ago for most children , the beginning of the school year is an exciting time , especially for those moving from nursery into mainstream schooling for the first time			1
but for one little boy , this transition is all the more special , having survived five rounds of chemotherapy to treat a rare form of kidney cancer which had spread to his lungs and liver			1
@entity18 , four , was diagnosed a year ago , but three weeks ago was well enough to start school thanks to life saving treatment at @entity22			1
now his mother @entity23 has decided to share @entity0 's story to help raise awareness of childhood cancers and the importance of the work of @entity29 , which funds life saving research			1
@entity23 , 36 , who lives in @entity32 , @entity33 said : ' i call @entity0 my little @entity36 truck as nothing knocks him and he just keeps on going			1
' he 's unbelievable and has responded amazingly well to everything that 's been thrown at him			0
@entity0 has a strong body and all he focuses on are the good things			2
' last summer he was going through major surgery to take out a kidney with cancer in it and this august he was getting his bag packed ready for a first day at school			1
what a difference a year makes			0
' but @entity0 's fierce fight for life started on the day he was born			1
@entity23 recalls vividly how excited she and her husband @entity51 were ahead of their first child @entity0 's birth			1
pregnancy scans had not picked up any problems so it was a huge shock when doctors at @entity60 , @entity58 explained that @entity0 was struggling to breathe			2
at just 72 hours old , @entity0 went in to heart failure and was blue lighted through to hospital where he endured a nine hour operation to repair his heart			2
@entity0 's treatment involved two major operations and aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy despite his intensive treatment , @entity0 has taken everything in his stride , attending nursery whenever he could before @entity0 was diagnosed , the only symptoms he displayed were tiredness and some nausea @entity23 , here with @entity75 and @entity0 at a party , is incredibly proud of the way @entity0 has handled everything @entity23 said : ' the first week after the operation was awful			1
it took several attempts to get @entity0 off the ventilator and breathing on his own again			2
@entity0 was in hospital for two and a half months			2
staying in that hospital with @entity0 became my whole life			2
but we got through it and after we finally got home @entity0 did really well			2
' we started to relax , feeling that @entity0 had been through his fair share of bad luck and was free to grow up healthy			0
it never entered our heads that at just three , @entity0 would have to go through a second life threatening problem totally unrelated to the first			0
what were the chances of that ? ' that 's why it was a such a blow when just months after @entity0 's brother @entity75 , now two , was born , @entity0 's appetite vanished and he became permanently exhausted			1
worried , @entity23 took @entity0 to the doctor who referred them to hospital for more tests			1
and in april 2013 , @entity0 was diagnosed with a @entity109 tumour ; a rare and aggressive cancer in both kidneys which scans revealed had already spread to his lungs and liver			1
@entity23 said : ' he needed the highest dose of chemotherapy and radiotherapy they could give			0
' @entity0 's left kidney was twice the size it 's meant to be			1
it was huge and he had three tumours in his second kidney as well as tumours in the main vein leading up to his heart			0
he started on chemotherapy straight away			0
' @entity23 has decided to share @entity0 's story to help raise awareness of childhood cancers @entity0 ( right ) with his little brother @entity75 ( centre ) and father @entity51 during his treatment at first they were warned that @entity0 may need to have both kidneys removed - facing a lifetime on dialysis or a transplant			1
but a surgeon at @entity22 in @entity141 succeeded in saving 90 per cent of @entity0 's right kidney			1
explaining to @entity0 what was happening to him was heartbreaking for his family			0
@entity23 said : ' @entity0 knew that he was n't managing to eat a lot			1
i told him there was something inside called a tumour inside his tummy			0
' i explained that he had all those bits in his body and there was something pushing on his tummy that the doctor was going to take out to make him feel better again			0
i told him there were bad cells that the doctors were going to take away			0
i tried to be as honest with him as i could			0
' and in november last year , @entity0 returned to @entity141 to have the tumours on his right kidney removed			1
only six days later @entity0 was well enough to explore all five floors of @entity164 's world famous toy shop in @entity165			2
@entity0 spent @entity166 at home in @entity33 with the family ahead of three weeks in january of radiotherapy @entity0 , pictured here with father @entity51 , was shown in the latest scans to be tumour free @entity23 , here with @entity0 and carrying @entity75 is supporting @entity173 , raising money to help beat childrens ’ cancer sooner it meant @entity0 could spend @entity166 at home in @entity33 with the family ahead of three weeks in january of radiotherapy where he had to endure an anaesthetic every day			1
@entity23 said ; ' the nursery staff and parents have been amazing			0
' they gave me a a photobook with lovely messages and they 've been there every step of the way			0
through all of this it was really important to me that everything was kept as normal as possible for @entity0 and he 's been at nursery as often as he can be			2
' just weeks ago , mum @entity23 was speechless when doctors explained that latest scans show the treatment is working			1
@entity23 said ; ' that took my breath away			0
they can see no tumours or abnormalities in his body at the moment			0
' @entity0 absolutely loves school			2
he finished treatment about three weeks before he started so he did n't feel too unwell and his hair was semi back - so he felt quite normal			0
' it 's early days now and too early to talk about a cure			0
but things have gone so well so far and although there may be a lot of worry ahead but we 'll get through it with the help of friends and family			0
' @entity23 is supporting @entity173 , a campaign supported by @entity222 and @entity29 raising money to help beat kids ’ cancer sooner			1
visit tkmaxx.com since 2004 , the campaign has raised £ 13.2m to help the charity find ways to beat children ’s cancers sooner by funding research into many areas including developing better treatments that also reduce the long term side effects			0
