with its swathes of waving blue flowers , delicious scent and squadrons of butterflies and bees , i am standing in a field that could be in @entity9 in the @entity10			0
a great plantation of lavender , rows and rows of it , stretches away from me , snaking across the hillside			2
close your eyes and you could be on the slopes of @entity20 , where lavender is as important a crop as wheat or grapes			2
amazingly , however , i am on a very special 50 - acre farm in @entity26 — a county where conservative farmers rarely venture away from traditional livestock and grain growing			2
@entity31 tends to the lavender on the farmland bought by her father , @entity34			1
he acquired it as an investment following the death of his wife , @entity39 , from breast cancer in 1993 this lavender farm belongs to the @entity44 family , and for all the beauty it brings to the landscape , the story of how this field of soft blue came to grow there is a deeply poignant one			1
in 1993 , @entity53 ’s wife @entity39 died of breast cancer			1
their son , @entity55 , was just five years old and their daughter , @entity57 , had turned three only a few days before			1
their devastated dad , a @entity26 - born property businessman , decided to leave work and raise the two children himself			1
he was devoted to his new role			0
the children went to the school near their village of @entity67 , which is not far from @entity68			1
a year after @entity39 ’s death , @entity34 heard about some land just outside the village which was coming up for sale			1
it may look like a scene from @entity9 - but this is in fact the @entity77 's 50 - acre farm in @entity26 ‘ i wanted to buy something for the children as an investment , so i put in a bid , ’ he says			1
but he said nothing to the children , not wishing to disappoint them if he failed to get it			2
‘ on the day the deal was to be done , i asked my solicitor to call me at home and , if i had been successful , use code if one of the children answered the phone			2
the solicitor called later , and said cryptically to @entity55 : “ tell your father to take a bath			1
” ’ hearing the message , @entity34 realised he ’d got the farm and jumped in the car with @entity55 and @entity31			1
‘ when we got there , i said to them : “ this is your farm now			2
” and when i saw them running across the field towards the woodland , i knew i ’d done the right thing			0
’ @entity34 , who insists he is neither a gardener nor farmer , wanted to do something different with the land			1
‘ i wondered what to grow , and had decided it should be garlic , but then one day , in a waiting room , i picked up a magazine and began reading an article about lavender			1
’ inspired , he did some research into the soil and hill position of the farm — then planted ten types of lavender in the field			1
it became a project for him and the children			2
they ’d regularly go there after school to work on the fledgling farm			1
@entity31 , who ’s now 22 , remembers it well			1
‘ it never seemed odd to us , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity136 and @entity55 did most of the work , while i watched			1
’ it takes four years for a lavender plant to reach full size			2
the largest of the species , @entity141 — the type favoured in @entity9 for making lavender oil , toiletries and soap — grows to 3ft			2
there are a number of traditional , @entity151 - bred varieties , including my personal favourite , @entity154 , which has the deepest blue flowers yet grows to just 18 in high			0
@entity53 at the farm , which is near to the village of @entity67			1
he refers to his children , who now work there , collectively as ' the boss ' at first it seems extraordinary that lavender , a plant associated with sunshine and blue skies , should do so well in the @entity26 hills , which are often snow - covered in winter and where winds can blow at up to 100 miles an hour			1
but @entity34 , who has never been to @entity9 , had realised at the outset that lavender could survive on his children ’s farm			1
‘ @entity172 is very hardy and can take frosts of up to minus 20 , ’ he says			0
in fact , the @entity26 climate mirrors that of the @entity10 , where winters are also harsh			0
the lavender on the farm begins life as a cutting , propagated in a tunnel			2
once these cuttings have formed a small but sturdy bush , they can be planted outside			0
head gardener @entity186 says : ‘ all they need is plenty of good drainage , so a hilly position is perfect , and poor soil is fine			0
’ she plants a variety of lavenders , not just for the pretty patchwork created by the various purples , blue , pinks and white , but so they can pick it from may until september			0
‘ @entity198 is the first to flower , then @entity154 — and we are still picking flowers in november from the @entity202 , ’ says @entity186			0
once the flowering is over , the lavender is pruned down to the hard wood , which helps ensure abundant flowering the following year and keeps the plants tidy			2
today , there is a shop and tea room selling food and products made with their own lavender			2
i have to admit being sceptical about the use of lavender in food			2
i remember , years ago , ordering a lavender pannacotta in a café : it tasted like body lotion			0
‘ ah , that is because chefs have to know which lavender to use , ’ says @entity34			1
‘ there are two main groups : @entity154 , which is used for soaps and perfume , and @entity228 , which is best for cooking because it has less oil			0
if a chef gets the wrong type , then food can taste awful			0
’ recipes for their own lavender biscuits , jams , ice cream and scones have been perfected over the years			0
@entity55 now runs @entity239 , the farm ’s online shop , while @entity31 , who has just graduated from university , is currently working at the farm			1
@entity34 often refers to them collectively as ‘ the boss ’			1
‘ it ’s their farm , ’ he says			0
‘ they make all the decisions — and i work for them			0
’ i taste an ‘ @entity260 ’ sundae , named after @entity31 , from a tall glass packed with a sinful combination of lavender ice cream , honeycomb crisp , crushed berries and whipped cream			1
@entity261 and fragrant , the slight , heady hint of mint from the lavender is subtle and surprising			0
the freshly baked scones , dotted with flowers and served with a dollop of clotted cream and a berry and lavender jam , are a revelation			0
outside , visitors begin to arrive			0
the farm has become a popular stop for tourists			0
some just marvel at the oddity of it — a purple patch on a landscape of wheat fields and green pasture ; some come to buy lavender and other plants for their own gardens and window boxes			0
at the heart of a lavender field is a memorial to @entity39 : four pyramids each built to the height of father , mother , son and daughter at the time of her death			1
the pyramid representing the three - year - old @entity31 is particularly moving			2
‘ breast cancer is a terrible disease , ’ says @entity34			1
“ my mother died of it , as well as my wife			0
it is awful ... ” he trails off , looking away			0
his family ’s unusual farm has achieved extraordinary success , but none of it was planned			0
it grew from a small idea to bring some happiness back to three people , and became a lot more besides			0
‘ we never expected it to be like this , ’ says @entity31 , frantically serving a queue of customers buying lavender plants			1
‘ i think @entity321 would be laughing with us from heaven			0

@entity53 bought farmland as an investment for his children after the death of his wife , @entity39 , from breast cancer in 1993
he was going to grow garlic , then read about lavender in a magazine
daughter @entity31 , and son , @entity55 , now work on the farm , near @entity67
@entity34 refers to them collectively as ' the boss '
