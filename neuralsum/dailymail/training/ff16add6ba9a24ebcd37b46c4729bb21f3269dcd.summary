by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 13 december 2013 @entity1 in @entity2 came early this week to nearly 300 students attending school in the @entity6 village of @entity7			2
thanks to the volunteer program coordinated by the @entity10 , @entity11 and mrs. @entity12 greeted children in the western @entity2 community and took pictures with them before helper elves handed out gifts			1
' @entity11 and mrs. @entity12 is not something that normally happens out there for them			2
it 's commonplace for us here in @entity23 or the bigger towns to be able to go to the malls and see @entity11 , ' said @entity26 , the chairwoman of @entity11 , as she and 24 other volunteers waited early wednesday morning at @entity28 to load a military @entity30 cargo plane for the 300 mile flight			2
the @entity32 : @entity11 and mrs. @entity12 getting off a small airplane to visit the children at the school			1
the visit is part of the @entity10 's @entity11 , which visits several remote @entity39 villages each year what do you want this year ? children at the school in @entity7 , @entity2 , standing in line to @entity11 and mrs. @entity12 ' for them , it 's a real extra treat , ' she said			1
the fact the visit even happened is a testament to the adaptability of @entity2 , whose flight plans change at any given moment because of weather or mechanical issues			1
flying — oftentimes in bad weather — is required in @entity2 since most of communities are off the state 's limited road system			1
the original plan was to fly the volunteers in the military transport to the western @entity2 hub community of @entity67 , and then take the @entity10 's @entity68 the last 12 miles to @entity7			1
but a mechanical issue grounded the helicopter , making it appear the program 's second scheduled visit to the @entity6 community would be a bust			1
a mechanical failure doomed a planned visit last month			1
tears of joy : @entity79 , 2 , crying while having her photo taken with @entity11 look what i got ! @entity83 , 6 , displaying the gift she got from @entity11 and mrs. @entity12			0
the visit was part of the @entity10 's @entity11 , which visits several remote @entity39 villages each year instead of giving up , 10 - year program veteran @entity89 went to the armory 's waiting area and dug out her cellphone			1
within minutes , she found a local air taxi company , @entity94 , willing to donate a flight to take about a third of the volunteers and gifts to @entity7 , despite wind gusts of up to 50 mph			0
this was n't even the most creative fix she and others have come up with since the program began in 1956			1
they try to visit three remote @entity2 villages every year			1
' we 've gone on dog sled from different villages , snowmachines , atvs , pickup trucks , whatever it is			2
we adapt and overcome , and it 's all to make the kids ' @entity1 and bring a little joy to them , ' @entity89 said			0
@entity89 and others applauded when the pilot set the small commuter plane down on the airstrip outside @entity7			0
the visitors arriving in the school multipurpose room , where lunch was just finishing up , created a buzz throughout the school — not to mention the entire community after an announcement was sent village - wide			2
gifts : ( @entity129 ) a volunteer holding an orange and an apple , which was the last gift presented to the children			0
( @entity134 ) a box of books that were presented to the kids along with @entity1 presents remote : @entity7 is a @entity6 village on the @entity139 just upstream from the @entity140 in western @entity2			1
just over 700 people live there the great outdoors : boats make their way along tributaries of the @entity140			0
the river is the main transportation corridor for the village of @entity7 ' not only the kids and the parents came , but we had the elders and a lot of the community members participating , as well , ' said assistant principal @entity156 , who was wearing a green kupsuk , a traditional @entity39 smock made for him by another instructor			0
everyone was excited ' because we hardly get @entity11 , and it 's fun for the kids , ' said senior @entity162 , 17			0
teachers , some speaking in @entity164 , others in @entity6 , paraded their students into the gym , where photos were taken with @entity11 and mrs. @entity12			0
some of the smaller children had broad smiles on their faces , others left @entity11 's lap in tears , but those soon dried up as they lined up to receive their gifts			0
' they get scared , some of them , the first time seeing him ( @entity11 ) , ' said parent @entity179 , adding the program is good not only for children , but families			2
photo op : children at the village school having their pictures taken with @entity11 and mrs. @entity12			0
the visitors arriving in the school created a buzz throughout entire community after an announcement was sent village - wide welcome to @entity11 's grotto , @entity2 style : assistant principal @entity156 ( in green kupsuk ) waiting to hand out gifts to children after they had their pictures taken with @entity11 and @entity12 in the school gym students returned to their classroom , only to be replaced by older students			1
the @entity203 helped arrange for gifts for all children , up through age 18			0
since two - thirds of the volunteers remained in @entity67 , plans had to be changed on the fly			2
after the older kids received their presents , the younger children came back to receive more gifts			2
the children got backpacks filled with school supplies , toys , toothbrushes and floss			0
long gone are the days when children received bags of candy , and the toothbrushes are intended to promote good dental care in rural @entity2 , where there are few dentists			0
children were also given a book , which @entity89 said is the highlight for many children , and received an apple and an orange each on the way out of the gym — a treasure in western @entity2 , where fresh fruit is an expensive luxury			0
you 're on the naughty list : two - year - old @entity241 crying while having a picture taken with mrs. @entity12 .			1

@entity10 visits remote villages each year with a special guest delivering presents
the program has been running ten years so some of the most difficult - to - reach places in the state
this years visit almost did n't happen after a helicopter broke down and there were no flying *reindeer* to hand
