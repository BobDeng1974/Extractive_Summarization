in the words of @entity1 : ‘ your mother knows how to push your buttons because she installed them			1
’ the relationship between a mother and daughter is a complex one – some hate each other and can barely spend a @entity10 lunch in their company , while others go on spa trips , talk daily and even share clothes			1
according to a new book called @entity18 there are nine different types of daughter , ranging from the @entity21 and the daughter of @entity23 to the @entity24			1
according to a new book called @entity18 there are nine different types of daughter ( file photo ) @entity31 author @entity30 decided to write the book after her mother came down with with a serious illness			1
sat outside the hospital after visiting one day , @entity30 wondered how she would cope when her mother was gone			2
had she been a good enough daughter ? would she have enough time to do all the things she wanted to do with her mother before she died ? @entity30 knew she could n't be the only one feeling this way			1
she began her research and quickly learned that other daughters had similar fears and had never spoken about them before			0
she put out a request in journalist @entity44 ’s newspaper column in the @entity45 for other women who had difficult relationships with their mother and got hundreds of responses			1
after whittling the group down to nine women , who @entity30 believed best portrayed all of the main tribes of daughters , they started to regularly meet in the kitchen of @entity30 ’s home in @entity58			0
eventually , their stories formed the basis of @entity18 - nine daughters coming together to talk about their mothers and the joy and despair that this relationship bring , with the aim of improving those relationships			1
a daughter 's relationship with her mother is one of the most influential of her life ( file photo ) @entity30 said : ' every daughter still yearns for the approval of her mother , at the end of the day , it is one of the relationships that really matters			1
' for daughters , the relationship with their mothers is one of the longest of their lives , longer than with our partners and our children			0
' your mother is your first female role model , so that has profound influence on how you ’re shaped and you view the world from an early age - your mother is integral to that			1
she has a massive influence on you because she brings comfort and joy and she ’s the one you turn to when in trouble - she ’s your safe haven			2
when she starts to get older and nears a time that she might pass away , that safety net is pulled out from underneath you and it ’s like a juggernaut coming down the road			0
the @entity18 is about resolving that for yourself			1
@entity30 , who wrote the @entity108 so which daughter are you ? read on to find out … the busy daughter you do n’t always answer the phone when your mother rings , you make promises you ca n’t keep , when she rings the door you hide and you try to get your mother off the phone as quickly as possible when you do pick up			1
has your mother become the person that you say , ‘ oh do n’t worry , it ’s only my mother ’ about when she calls or makes plans that you want to avoid			2
the daughter of madness when your mother has been diagnosed with a mental illness , but when you ’re younger you do n’t realise why they are behaving oddly			1
you might crave a mother who would make you feel secure and cherished and as you get older , you can not rewrite the past			2
this can make it very difficult when you come to deciding whether you want a daughter of your own			2
the daughter of @entity23 your mother is totally self - absorbed , constantly criticises you and makes you feel like a nuisance			1
she should n’t have been a mother at all			2
the becoming - my - mother daughter a lot of people have this			1
you begin to hear phrases , expressions and tones of her voice in things you say that you swore that you ’d never say or do			0
it happens most often when you speak to your partner , children or dog			0
you ’ve got to decide how bad that could be though – is it the worst thing in the world that you turn out like your mother ? the grieving - as - she - lives daughter this is the daughters who once had a relationship with their mother and one day that is taken away because of an illness like @entity159 ’s and they have no control over it			1
you have to accept it , you ’ve lost her and you ’re grieving as she is living			0
the dedicated daughter is a daughter who spends plenty of time with her mother , goes travelling with her , cooks with her and listens to her ( file photo ) the dependent daughter this is ‘ @entity171 ’			1
you ring your mother at every chance you get			2
you rely on her for everything from your washing on the weekends to advice on cooking , and when you ca n’t cook the dinner yourself , you go over and eat at her house			0
you always talk about yourself and never ask how your mother is			2
you she still sees your mother as a mother , not a person in her own right because you have n’t made that transition where you see her as a friend			2
you might even be leaning on her to the point where you ’ve become a bit of a burden , even though she ’ll never say that because she ’s your mother			2
the dedicated daughter you cook with her , travel with her want to get to know her more than you already do			2
you might even have already spoken about what she would like at her funeral			0
you take her as an individual , ask her what the things are that she wants to do in this chapter of her life and you try your best to accommodate them			0
you have made the transition from mother and daughter to friends , but are also conscious that there is very little time left			1
your behaviour sometimes this spills over into dis - empowering your mother though , telling them what they should be doing			1
the reluctant daughter is a daughter who resents having to visit her mother and spend time with her ( file photo ) the reluctant daughter even though she knows she should do the right thing by her mother , she does n’t want to – she has to be dragged kicking and screaming			1
this particularly happens with an only child – if your mother gets sick , there is only you to look after her , but you are doing it with resentment and bitterness			0
you do n’t like your mother and do n’t think she deserves it			0
you visit them but do n’t want to , then feel guilty about feeling that way			0
it is often the behaviour of a reluctant teenager , not wanting to go home and help out with the house , wanting to hang out with your friends instead			0

lots of these daughters sell the family home and put their mother into a home			0
the disappointing daughter you do n’t live up to expectation			0
your mother had an expectation of you that you did n’t know about			0
as you grown up , you start to realise that you are n’t meeting these expectations and your mother ca n’t help but tell you this			0
you were always criticised at school – if you got a b , then you should have got an a , if you scored two goals , then you should have won the match			0
you realise this as an adult when your mother comes to visit and she criticises how you ’re raising your children			0
that ’s when a lot of these relationships break down , because you do n’t want to allow her to criticise your children			0
you will always seek her approval even though she will continue to criticise you			0
