@entity0 will be remembered as one of the most significant cricketers in history but his retirement from @entity5 on tuesday may just be the boost the ultimate form of the game needs in its most influential country			1
@entity0 , who stepped down at the end of the drawn third test in @entity12 , is hugely significant because he became the symbol of modern @entity15 cricket during the era when they emerged as the richest and most powerful of them all			1
yet his decision to concentrate on limited - overs cricket is welcome because for the last three years at least he has been a negative , indifferent presence at the helm of a side he once led to the top of the test rankings as well as a @entity26			0
tests : 60 won : 27 lost : 18 drawn : 15 win rate : 45 % yet as soon as white clothing was replaced by blue @entity0 sprang to life and again became the dynamic , swashbuckling batsman and captain who has become a @entity58 - like figure in his homeland			1
perhaps we should not be surprised that @entity0 should prioritise the shorter game as it is one - day and @entity63 cricket that has made him fabulously wealthy , with annual earnings of around $ 30million ( £ 19.3m ) a year			1
no - one has had a bigger workload than @entity0 in world cricket – he has played in a staggering 398 matches since the start of 2008 - and something had to give but that does not excuse the uninterested way he has led @entity27			2
@entity0 shows innovation and skill with an agility testing sweep during the @entity77 in @entity12 @entity78 ( right ) will take over permanently from @entity0 as @entity27 skipper in the ultimate form of the game @entity0 ( fourth from right ) shakes hands with the @entity85 players after @entity86 conceded the draw tests 90 runs 4876 highest score 224 average 38.09 hundreds 6 fifties 33 catches 256 @entity90 38 @entity0 only survived the 4 - 0 thumpings by both @entity43 and @entity30 three years ago because of his close association with the discredited former @entity27 board president @entity93 but he should have gone after @entity43 ’s 3 - 1 win			1
as it was he staggered on until his heir apparent @entity78 finally started to replicate his prolific one - day form in test cricket , hitting three centuries against @entity30 in a series @entity27 trail 2 - 0 with one game to play			1
the gifted and feisty @entity78 will take over for the dead rubber in @entity104 in the new year and beyond and it is his style of leadership that provides hope that @entity27 may again treat test cricket as seriously as they do the shorter stuff			0
@entity78 will be positive , as he was when he stood in for @entity0 in @entity111 at the start of the series , and is likely to display none of the conservatism that marked his predecessor as one of the most unimaginative modern leaders			2
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates victory in the @entity120 with @entity121 ( centre ) and @entity123 ( left ) @entity0 watches a @entity125 ramp shot go over his head during a 2011 series in @entity128 @entity27 will hope , though , that he can control a temper that has seen him clash with at least one @entity85 virtually every day of the current series , enhancing his reputation as one of the game ’s biggest and most volatile sledgers			0
at least life will never be dull under @entity78 , who will be as interesting in public as @entity0 was dull , as demonstrated when the new captain said he did n’t respect @entity139 because the fast bowler showed scant respect for him			2
@entity0 ’s departure was typical of a man who has had little time for the media			0
he made no reference to his fate during the @entity149 press conferences yet 15 minutes later a release confirmed that he would step down			0
there will be little of the criticism that @entity153 attracted when he retired mid-series because @entity0 is largely fawned upon in @entity27 and attracts the sort of adulation that is barely credible for cricketers outside his country			2
@entity78 is ideally poised to lead @entity27 in test cricket and is unlikely to show the negativity of @entity0 the ability of @entity78 ( right ) with the bat is in no doubt , though his temper and discipline may be a worry @entity78 ( centre ) has hit three centuries in this series against @entity30 and stepped in for @entity0 in the first test a visit to his home town of @entity173 for a one - day international against @entity43 two years ago was to see extraordinary levels of devotion and attention , something that , to be fair , @entity0 has dealt with calmly and with dignity			1
now , at 33 , he will have more time to devote to his beloved motor bikes , his fascination with all things military and his support of @entity183 – he showed much more enthusiasm for @entity27 ’s games of football during practice before each day ’s play last summer than he did once he was out in the middle			0
but @entity0 will be around for some time yet in the one - day arena where he can be expected to make both a big impact and huge amounts of money			0
yes , a significant cricketer but he was some way short of being a great one .			0

@entity0 retired from @entity5 after the drawn match against @entity30
@entity0 will go down as one of cricket history 's most significant figures
but @entity0 's *disinterest* when leading his country in @entity5 was *obvious*
*keeper* - batsman *sparked* to life in the limited over forms of the game
his retirement from @entity5 gives @entity78 *kohli* *chance* to lead his country
