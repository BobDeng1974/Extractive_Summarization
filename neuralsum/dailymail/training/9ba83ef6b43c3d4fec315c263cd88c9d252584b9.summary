by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 15 may 2012 @entity2 creator @entity1 wanted @entity3 to direct the first 007 movie , it has emerged			1
a telegram sent in 1959 has revealed one of the biggest ‘ what ifs ’ in @entity11 cinema history and will leave @entity2 fans shaken and stirred			2
@entity1 sent the communique in which he asked @entity3 to take the helm of the first @entity2 film through a mutual friend			1
turned down : 007 creator @entity1 ( left ) sent @entity3 ( right ) a telegram in 1959 asking if he would be interested in directing the first @entity2 film @entity22 and @entity23 star in the first @entity2 film , 1962 's dr no. when @entity1 approached @entity3 , @entity20 had been intended as the first film outlining the plot , the telegram was sent to novelist @entity29 , asking : ' would @entity3 be interested ? ' he added : ' have written @entity2 movie treatment featuring @entity31 stolen atomic bomber blackmail of @entity33 culminating @entity34 with extensive underwater dramatics			1
' the plot in question was for @entity20 , which had originally been intended as the first @entity2 film and ended up being made in 1965 , before it was decided dr no should be the first movie in the franchise			1
the telegram continued : ' this is for my friend @entity42 ’s @entity44 which recently completed @entity45 , @entity33 ’s choice for @entity48 festival but blasted by critics and flop at @entity50 though now doing excellently on pre-release rank circuit			0
' would @entity3 be interested in directing this first @entity2 film in association with @entity53 ? ' @entity1 ended the telegram : ' plentiful finance available			1
this purely old boy enquiry without involvement but think we might all have a winner particularly if you were conceivably interested in scripting			0
' his sign off was mistakenly transcribed ' regardest @entity1 '			0
the telegram , sent in september 1959 , has this week been posted on the website @entity65			0
ladies ' man : @entity68 in @entity20 , which ended up the fourth in the series and was released in 1965 the contents of @entity1 's telegram came to light in @entity74 by @entity75 , which details the origins of the 1965 film @entity20 , which was supposed to have been the first 007 film @entity80			1

this for my friend @entity42 's @entity44 which recently completed boy and @entity33 's choice for @entity88 but blasted by critics and flop at @entity50 though now doing excellently on pre-release rank circuit			0
would @entity3 be interested in directing this first @entity2 film in association with @entity53 ? plentiful finance available			2
this purely old boy enquiry without involvement but think we might all have a winner particularly if you were conceivably interested in @entity101 @entity1 dr no eventually came out in 1962 and was directed by @entity103 , while its star @entity23 went on to work with @entity3 on 1964 's @entity106			1
the rejection meant there was no ‘ hitchcockian ’ @entity2 , and @entity1 offered the director role to @entity103 , who went on to direct three films in the series - dr no , from @entity112 with @entity113 and @entity20			1
thunderball , which starred @entity23 as @entity2 , proved a phenomenal hit at the box - office when it was eventually released in 1965 , and remains the most financially successful @entity2 film , allowing for inflation			2
it is remembered by fans for the behind - the - scenes dispute between @entity1 and his screenwriters @entity92 and @entity124 who sued the author over claims he stole the original plot from them			0
the letter emerged in the book @entity74 by @entity75 , which chronicles this long - gestating copyright dispute surrounding @entity20 , which continued into the 1980s			0
the ' unofficial ' 1983 @entity2 film @entity133 , which brought @entity68 back to the role after an absence of 12 years , was made as a result .			2

@entity1 approached @entity3 by sending a telegram through mutual friend
at the time in 1959 , @entity20 was *planned* as the first @entity2 film
dr no instead *ushered* in the 007 big screen era in 1962
it was directed by @entity103 as was @entity20 in 1965
