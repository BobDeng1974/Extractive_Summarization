this year 1.73billion bricks will be produced in the @entity19 , the highest number since before the 2008 financial crash , according to the @entity22 orders for bricks are so high that kilns will be kept firing over @entity27 for the first time since 2007 before the financial crash sent construction into freefall			1
the 1.73billion bricks manufactured in 2013 is up from the 1.46billion produced last year , and the highest since 2.39billion made in 2007			2
housing minister @entity33 said the government ’s flagship help to buy mortgage scheme had helped to persuade builders to kickstart construction across the country			1
the first round of the scheme , where the state guarantees mortgages for those who struggle to save a large deposit , only applied to new homes in an attempt to stimulate demand and encourage more house building			0
mr @entity33 said : ‘ help to buy has not only helped thousands of hard working families get on the housing ladder , it ’s also laid the foundations for a recovery in housebuilding , and confounded the critics who claimed it would have no impact on the supply of new homes			0
’ he was speaking on a visit to a new @entity60 brick factory in @entity61 - under - @entity62 , which has created 51 jobs			0
mr @entity33 added : ‘ enough bricks will be made in 2013 to go 9 times round the earth or build 28 @entity68 stations , and i ’m hoping next year we ’ll make enough to reach the moon			1
’ housing minister @entity33 ( centre ) visited @entity60 brick factory , which will keep kilns fired over @entity27 for the first time since 2007 eight out of 10 bricks manufactured in the @entity19 are used for housebuilding , while orders for all building materials are now growing at the fastest rate for 10 years			1
latest figures show that construction in the three months to september was 4.1 per cent higher than the same time in 2012			0
the help to buy scheme was extended in october to offer state - backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent			2
it is expected to inject further activity into the market among credit - worthy buyers who have particularly struggled to get on the housing ladder or move up it since the financial crisis struck because they have a lack of upfront funds			0
@entity98 prices surged by 6.5 per cent year - on - year in november , marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years , @entity96 reported today			1

boom time : house prices rose 6.5 per cent year - on - year in november , marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years governor @entity117 said the @entity118 ( @entity120 ) stimulus was no longer needed amid rising house prices , and it would instead be focused on helping small business borrowing , which remains muted			1
@entity118 has offered lenders access to cheap finance on condition that they pass on the benefits to borrowers , and experts yesterday said that the @entity107 's move could spell the " beginning of the end " for ultra-cheap mortgage deals			0
fears of a looming property bubble have been growing in recent months amid a string of reports suggesting demand in the housing market far outstrips the growth in the supply of homes			0
@entity141 in particular has seen strong demand this year , and @entity144 figures released yesterday showed that house prices in @entity141 were up by 8.7 per cent year - on - year in october			2
