@entity0 this afternoon scoffed at claims by @entity3 leader @entity2 that he would never do a deal with the @entity5 to become prime minister - insisting he will ' change his tune ' after the election			1
the @entity10 first minister said mr @entity2 simply ' wo n't have the votes to say that he is going to do what he likes come what may ' and reiterated her call for @entity3 to ' work together to lock the @entity15 out '			1
it came after mr @entity2 this morning repeatedly insisted he would not enter into any deal with the @entity5 after the election - either as a formal coalition or a looser pact to put him in @entity21			1
. ' @entity3 is expected to suffer heavy losses in @entity10 - where it won 41 seats in 2010 - with forecasts suggesting ms @entity0 's party could see as many as 50 mps elected			1
the latest set of @entity45 - wide polls indicate that the @entity47 race is still neck - and - neck , with the country heading for a probable hung parliament and coalition negotiations after may 7			0
pressed on whether he would consider a confidence - and - supply deal with the @entity5 to ensure backing for a @entity54 if he failed to secure an overall majority , mr @entity2 said : ' i am not interested in deals , no. ' the @entity3 leader told @entity32 's @entity31 : ' if it is a @entity3 government it will be a @entity59 , it will be a @entity60			1
it will not be written by the @entity5			0
' but ms @entity0 told @entity62 : ' on may 8 once the votes are cast , once the people have cast their verdict , @entity2 , just like the rest of us , will have to respect the wishes of the people in a democratic election			0
@entity0 , the leader of the @entity5 , visits @entity72 community club in @entity73 during a campaign event , @entity10 ms @entity0 launched the @entity5 's youth manifesto today as polls predicted the party would win a landslide victory on may 7 @entity5 leader @entity0 speaking at a rally of female activists to launch the @entity5 's women 's pledge today ' if there is a minority government , if no party has an overall majority , then it 's simply not possible to ignore the views of other parties - i know that , i was part of a minority government at the @entity92			1
' so if the @entity5 has a large number of mps , firstly we can use that clout to keep the @entity15 out , and secondly we can use it to ensure the @entity15 are replaced with something better , bolder and more progressive			2
' if that remains the case on may 8 if he does n't have a majority , what he will be saying to the people is rather than work with the @entity5 if there is an @entity107 majority , he 'd rather watch @entity108 waltz back into @entity109			0
' i do n't want that and the @entity5 will use our votes to stop a @entity15 government getting off the ground if there is that @entity107 majority			1
' ms @entity0 added : ' it 's the people who are in charge and the politicians have to respect the democratic wishes of the people , if @entity2 does n't get a majority , as the polls are all saying he wo n't , then he 'll have to work with other parties			1
' @entity108 delivers a speech to party activists while campaigning in @entity128 near @entity129 today mr @entity108 said he made ' no apology ' for focussing on the threat posed by the @entity5 in the election next month the latest opinion poll in @entity10 shows @entity3 remains on course for heavy losses to the @entity10 nationalists in its heartlands north of the border - keeping hold of as few as five seats			1

with the election now less than two weeks away , the prime minister and other leading @entity15 have stepped up their attacks on the @entity5			2
@entity108 warned voters that they have ' 11 days to save @entity45 ' as he claimed @entity10 nationalists ' do n't want the country to succeed '			0
in an escalation of his rhetoric about the dangers of the may 7 general election producing a minority @entity3 government propped up by the @entity5 , he told the @entity156 that nationalist mps would be hoping for a ' disaster ' which would bring forward their dream of independence			2
meanwhile , conservative home secretary @entity161 told the @entity162 that a @entity3 / @entity5 government could be ' the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication ' , when @entity166 gave up the throne in 1936			0
ms @entity0 said : ' @entity161 has made herself look completely and utterly stupid with ridiculous over the top comments like that			0
' this is the same @entity161 that tried to tell the people of @entity10 during the referendum campaign that if we voted yes we would lose our passports and have border controls			0
' people will look at these silly comments , and i was going to say they will treat them with contempt , but that actually attaches too much seriousness to them			0
