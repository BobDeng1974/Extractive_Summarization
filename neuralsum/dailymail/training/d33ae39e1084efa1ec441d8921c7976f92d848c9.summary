the entire @entity0 was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station			1
the remarkable manoeuvre saw a @entity7 spacecraft ‘ slow ’ the speed of the station			1
this changed the height of its orbit very slightly , by about 1.6 miles ( 2.5km ) , before the station was spun back again to its original position			1
a @entity7 spacecraft was used to lower the orbit of the @entity0 yesterday ( illustrated )			1
the @entity17 was used to ' slow ' the station and move it down by 2.5km			2
but to do so required @entity20 to first spin the station 180 degrees			1
it was then spun back again when the boost was completed to move the station , the thrusters of @entity25 ’s @entity17 ( @entity17 ) were fired			1
usually , boosts are performed by a spacecraft docked to the @entity0 to raise the height of the space station or to avoid debris			2
the orbit of the @entity0 is regularly maintained , sometimes several times a year , but it is fairly rare for an @entity17 to be used for the procedure			0
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) is an unmanned spacecraft built by @entity25 that is used to bring cargo to the @entity0 the latest to be docked to the station , @entity17 - 5 , was the fifth and final cargo spacecraft @entity25 was contracted to supply the station with			1
atvs are given names honouring great scientists , and this one was named after @entity44 astronomer @entity43			0
the previous four were named @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
@entity49 was launched on 29 july 2014 and arrived at the station on 12 august 2014			0
it does not have the capability to return to @entity53 , so on 27 february 2015 it will be sent to burn up in @entity53 's atmosphere - with waste from the @entity0 on board			0
by boosting ‘ backwards ’ , the @entity0 speeds up in its orbit - and its altitude is slightly raised			0
but in this instance , @entity20 made the decision to lower the altitude of the space station by 1.6 miles ( 2.5km )			1
to do this , the @entity17 had to boost against the orbit of the @entity0 - and as it is docked to a @entity66 service module at the back of the station , the @entity0 had to be spun around so it was facing forwards			1
this was done using thrusters and gyrsocopes on the station			0
‘ the boost was weak , so the crew noticed no change , ’ a source at @entity25 told @entity78			1
‘ by lowering the orbit of the @entity0 , what happens is the apogee [ the point where the @entity0 is furthest from @entity53 , as its orbit is very slightly elliptical ] is lowered by 2.5km [ 1.6 miles ]			0
' combined with the drift and drag from @entity53 's atmosphere , this will eventually bring the @entity0 down by a total of about 9.3 miles ( 15km )			0
this will lower the altitude of its orbit from about 258 miles ( 415km ) to around 249 miles ( 400km )			0
‘ what this does is it sets up the phasing for the next docking , which is [ @entity66 ’s ] progress spacecraft , ' the source continued , ' and it means @entity96 will not have to use as much fuel to catch up and get to the @entity0 ’ the major benefit of this is that the incoming spacecraft will be able to carry more cargo , as it will not need to carry as much fuel			2
to lower the orbit of the 400,000kg @entity0 yesterday , it was first necessary to spin the entire station 180 degrees - to bring @entity25 's @entity49 round from the ' back ' to the ' front '			1
this was done using thrusters on board the station , which can alter its orientation			0
once the station had been spun , the @entity17 then fired its thrusters from 18.40.00 gmt to 18.44.49 gmt yesterday - just less than five minutes in total			2
after this boost , the station was then spun back again to its original position			2
the @entity0 also has reaction wheels on it - gyroscopes that can be spun to change the orientation of the station			0
a source at @entity25 told @entity78 that the crew on the @entity0 would barely have felt the move , if at all , and would have continued with their regular activities as normal			1
boosts like this are sometimes performed by other spacecraft when the orbit of the @entity0 needs to be maintained , or it needs to avoid a bit of debris			0
the use of an @entity17 to boost the station is fairly rare , though ; the last time it was used for such a purpose was back in 2008 , for an unplanned debris avoidance manoeuvre			0
to lower the orbit of the 400,000kg @entity0 ( pictured ) yesterday , it was first necessary to spin the entire station 180 degrees - to bring @entity25 's @entity49 round from the ' back ' to the ' front '			1
it is understood that , despite seeming fairly dramatic , spinning the station is actual a fairly routine manoeuvre - using its thrusters and gyroscopes to highlight how easy it is to move the @entity0 , this picture taken by @entity148 astronaut @entity147 in 2011 shows the entire space station at a slight angle			2
the @entity151 is seen docked at the top , while a previous @entity7 atv vehicle is seen docked at the bottom the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , pictured left is @entity49 , is an unmanned spacecraft built by @entity25 that is used to bring cargo to the iss. lowering the station will allow an upcoming @entity66 cargo spacecraft known as @entity96 , previously pictured right , to bring more cargo to the @entity0 it ’s believed that one of the reason ’s this boost was required is due to the explosion of @entity164 ’ @entity166 rocket on 28 october 2014			1
this rocket had been due to carry the @entity169 spacecraft to the station , which would have brought vital cargo with it			1
but the loss of the spacecraft means that others have to pick up the slack - so by lowering the orbit of the @entity0 , they can add slightly more cargo to their loads			2
this means more essential items like food and tools can be carried			0
while the @entity0 was not running critically low on any particular type of cargo , its understood by @entity78 that the water on board was reaching fairly low levels			0
the arrival of @entity17 - 5 in august , though , brought about 1,875lbs ( 850kg ) of water to the station - the last 265lbs ( 120kg ) of which were transferred to the @entity0 today			0
it ’s believed that one of the reasons the station 's orbit had to be lowered was due to the explosion of @entity164 ’ @entity166 rocket ( shown ) on 28 october 2014			1
this rocket had been due to carry the @entity169 spacecraft to the station , which would have brought vital cargo with it			2

a @entity7 spacecraft was used to lower the orbit of the iss yesterday
the @entity17 was used to ' slow ' the station and move it down by 1.6 miles
but to do so required @entity20 to first spin the station 180 degrees
it was then spun back again when the boost was completed
an @entity25 source told @entity78 the reason for this was to make it easier for spacecraft to reach the space station
this means they can carry less fuel and bring more cargo with them
one reason this is needed is because of the explosion of an @entity166 rocket in october - which *resulted* in the loss of cargo on the @entity169 vehicle
