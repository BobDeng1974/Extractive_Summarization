the term ' you want the ground to swallow you up ' was coined for that moment at @entity4 on wednesday night			0
slumped on his knees , crestfallen on the floor , @entity5 would happily have disappeared into the turf			1
how on earth do you hit the crossbar from six yards ? by the look on the @entity14 's face , not even he could tell you			1
@entity16 striker @entity5 somehow manages to hit the bar from close - range when it appeared easier to score with the goal gaping the 29 - year - old could only hit the crossbar as he miss hit his effort @entity24 - 59 apps , 15 goals @entity27 - 128 apps , 76 goals @entity30 - 60 apps , 29 goals @entity33 - 30 apps , 11 goals but it 's a feeling that has become all too familiar for @entity5			1
perhaps , not quite to the extent of his extraordinary miss against @entity39 - but it is the lack of goals that has defined his @entity24 career so far			1
fifteen goals in 18 months is n't an impressive return on a £ 26million outlay			1
so , then , it 's no surprise that manager @entity49 is listening to offers for the striker this month			1
it just has n't happened for the former @entity27 man			0
the @entity16 international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as @entity4 @entity5 has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season having arrived in @entity61 in 2013 as one of @entity64 's most prolific marksman , @entity5 's reputation has plummeted severely			1
he 's gone from being one of the most sought after players in @entity67 , to a major financial liability for @entity24			1
offloading @entity5 will be easier said than done this month			1
spurs know they 'll have to take a significant financial hit on the £ 26million they splashed on him			2
likewise , clubs prepared to match the player 's £ 65,000 - per - week wages are likely to be few and far between			2
a return to @entity16 seems the most likely destination for the striker			0
@entity24 boss @entity49 is happy to persist with @entity5 until the end of the season @entity81 have been linked with a move for the misfiring hitman , though there has also been an interest from @entity86			1
who knows , maybe even they are having second thoughts after watching his incredible miss on wednesday night			2
but it must be said that if a deal for @entity5 to leave @entity4 this month is n't reached , then @entity49 is happy to persist with the @entity14 until the end of the season			1
the striker is a popular member of the @entity24 squad , and @entity49 has been impressed with the @entity14 's attitude - which is more than can be said with regards to another @entity4 striker			1
his goalscoring apart , the other aspects of @entity5 's play is certainly appreciated by his team - mates			2
@entity5 scored 24 league goals in his final season at @entity27 before securing @entity24 move and in the face of criticism following his embarrassing miss against @entity39 , his colleagues have rallied round in his defence			1
' i felt for him			0
i have been in that position before where just nothing will go in for you , ' said @entity117			0
' he played well but as a striker i think he just wanted that goal			0
' i just ran over to him as we walked off at half time and tried to keep his spirits up			0
i just told him to forget about the miss and keep going			0
' i said i would try to put another cross in for him and that if he kept getting into the positions then he would get a goal			0
@entity117 said he offered some words of encouragement to @entity5 at half time ' that did n’t happen sadly but five minutes into the second half he put in an assist for @entity132			2
' look @entity133 is a fantastic character , he will pick himself up and dust himself down			0
' he continued to look dangerous in the second half and i was delighted he played well			0
we have seen in @entity16 he is a fantastic striker			0
he just needs the service and the game time			0
' then once he gets one or two goals i am sure the goals will start flowing			0
' here 's hoping , for @entity5 's sake .			2
