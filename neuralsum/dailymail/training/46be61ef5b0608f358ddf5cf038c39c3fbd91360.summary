the fearsome claws that once made up a dinosaur 's killing repertoire may have evolved to have a much more mundane and everyday use			1
@entity5 dinosaurs - a group which includes the @entity7 and velociraptor - are often regarded as carnivorous , predatory animals , using their sharp claws to capture prey			1
but , a detailed analysis of the claws on the forelimbs of a unique group of these dinosaurs has revealed that the form and shape varied widely between species , suggesting they may have been used for digging and grasping			1
a study from the @entity22 has revealed that during their transition from carnivores to herbivores , therapod dinosaurs developed a large variety of claw shapes adapted to specific functions such as digging , grasping or piercing			1
this illustration shows the different shapes in the therizinosaur group of theropods @entity5 dinosaurs - a group which includes the @entity7 and velociraptor - are often regarded as carnivorous , predatory animals			1
the name , for example , means ' beast footed '			0
therizinosaurs were an unusual group of theropods that lived between 145 and 66 million years ago			2
they were large animals - up to 22ft ( 7 metres ) tall with claws more than 19 inches ( 50 cm ) long on their forelimbs			0
they also had elongated necks and a coat of primitive , down - like feathers along their bodies			0
unlike their nearest relatives , however , the teeth and jaw morphology of therizinosaurs suggest they were herbivores			0
dr @entity56 from @entity22 ’s @entity57 studied the differences in claw shape to see how they are related to different functions			0
his research , published in the journal @entity63 , focused on the therizinosaurs - an unusual group of theropods that lived between 145 and 66 million years ago			2
dr @entity56 said therizinosaurs were very large animals , up to 22ft ( 7 metres ) tall , with claws more than 19 inches ( 50 cm ) long on their forelimbs			0
they also had elongated necks and a coat of primitive , down - like feathers along their bodies			0
unlike their nearest relatives , however , the teeth and jaw morphology of therizinosaurs suggest they were herbivores			0
to fully understand how the different claws on the forelimbs were used , detailed computer models were created to simulate a variety of possible functions for different species and claw morphologies			2
the dinosaur claws were also compared to the claws of modern - day mammals			1

this is a fossil of the enlarged claws on the forelimbs of the @entity96 in the course of evolution , several theropod groups , including therizinosaurs , changed from being carnivores to become plant eaters			1
the new study reveals that , during this transition , theropod dinosaurs developed a large variety of claw shapes adapted to specific functions , such as digging , grasping or piercing			1
dr @entity56 said : ‘ @entity5 dinosaurs were all bipedal , which means their forelimbs were no longer involved in walking as in other dinosaurs			0
' this allowed them to develop a whole new suite of claw shapes adapted to different functions			0
’ ' it ’s fascinating to see that , with the shift from a carnivorous to a plant - based diet , we find a large variety of claw shapes adapted to different functions			1
‘ this suggests dietary adaptations were an important driver during the evolution of theropod dinosaurs and their transition to modern birds			0
’ the research also found the claws of the nothronychus theropod adapted specifically for digging .			2

analysis of theropod dinosaur claws revealed a variety of different shapes
theropods include the @entity7 and velociraptors
findings suggest the claws of a unique group of theropods called therizinosaurs were used for digging and grasping
analysis involved comparing the claws to modern - day mammals
several theropod groups evolved from carnivores to plant eaters
during this transition , it 's *believed* the claws adapted to new functions
