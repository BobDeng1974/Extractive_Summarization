by @entity0 correspondent published : 10:20 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 23 september 2013 in just a few days ’ time the @entity1 and @entity2 will be moving into their new home at @entity4 following a £ 1.5 million overhaul			1
filled with priceless antiques from the @entity8 , the elegant 20 - room apartment will be the centrepiece of the couple ’s new court and a family home for their baby son , @entity13			1
decorated in shades of cream and eau du nil , it is said to be the epitome of ‘ @entity20 ’ – encapsulating the classic look of an @entity23 country house with a modern twist			0
and it could n’t be more of a contrast to the relatively modest four - bedroom farmhouse @entity28 and @entity2 quit on @entity29 earlier this month when the prince left his job as a @entity33 pilot			1
one of @entity2 's favourite shopping destinations during her three years living on @entity29 was the decidedly unglamorous @entity36 store the @entity1 and @entity2 will move into @entity4 with baby @entity13 in a few days in fact , the @entity37 can reveal , one of @entity2 ’s favourite shopping destinations during her three years living on the island was the decidedly unglamorous @entity41 on the @entity42 in @entity43			1
according to staff , the royal would spend up to an hour browsing , particularly in the lighting and bathroom department , and could n’t resist purchasing a few nick - nacks for her home			2
among her purchases was a three - tier chocolate brown ‘ faux leather ’ letter tray costing £ 22.99			1
‘ you ’ll never lose a document again ’ the store boasts of this ‘ polyurethane and @entity58 ’ bargain			0
perhaps @entity28 and @entity2 kept treasured pictures on this cork memo board , which she bought for £ 12.99 @entity63 snapped up this faux leather magazine file in brown for just £ 10.99 this three - tier letter tray , made of faux leather , £ 22.99 , will undoubtedly have been useful for storing @entity69 correspondence @entity2 apparently purchased this ' @entity71 ' cushion for £ 9.99 , which the @entity41 website says ' features applique stitched detail , and instantly updates any room ' @entity63 also bought a matching ‘ faux leatherette ’ magazine file for just £ @entity78 also snapped up a £ 12.99 cork memo board that is clearly popular amongst @entity41 clientele , scoring an impressive four out of five star rating on the firm ’s website			1
it also seems as if the couple ensured they dined royally , using pillar box - red @entity89 plate coasters , a snip at £ 1.49 ( a reduction of 50p )			1
the website says helpfully that they will ‘ protect your tables as well as adding a splash of colour to the room ) the piece de resistance , however , has to be the shop ’s red felt cushion with the word ‘ @entity71 ’ emblazoned on it – which first hit the shelves costing £ 9.99 but can now be snapped up for just £ 3.99			1
called the @entity106 , it is said to ‘ instantly update any room ’ – although it is not clear whether that includes one in an historic royal palace			0
the 20 - room @entity4 apartment has undergone a £ 1.5 million overhaul and is said to be decorated in neutral shades and to be filled with priceless antiques from the @entity8 whether any of her @entity41 bargains will find their way into the @entity118 ’ new home at @entity4 remains to be seen ( although if they did , the @entity120 , who has a keen eye for a bargain herself and is a regular user of cheap @entity124 , would be sure to approve )			1
the couple are due to move into @entity126 , which once belonged to @entity127 , in the next few days			1
the apartment is actually a spacious four - storey , 20 - room property with its own large south - facing walled garden , which takes up half the @entity133 wing originally designed by sir @entity134 for @entity28 and @entity135			1
it boasts generous living space , including five reception rooms , three main bedrooms , dressing rooms and bathrooms , a night and day nursery , staff bedrooms and ‘ ancillary ’ rooms			1
the previous resident of the young couple 's apartment was @entity127 , and her husband , @entity148 former residents include @entity150 , queen @entity152 ’s daughter , and the late monarch ’s grandson , the @entity155 , followed by , most recently , the @entity120 ’s sister , @entity127 , and her husband , @entity148			2
the couple , who moved in following a £ 1.5 million programme of refurbishment in 1963 , famously installed a ‘ futuristic ’ new kitchen ( which has since been ripped out ) complete with sleek @entity162 and teak units			2
it has been barely touched since the death of the @entity120 ’s sister in 2002 , however , and in recent years has been managed by the charity @entity167 ( @entity167 ) , which used the apartment as office and exhibition space			2
as @entity167 has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work , the @entity120 was last year forced to compensate it for handing the building over to @entity28 and @entity2			1
this was met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘ fair ’ , it is believed to be more than £ 100,000			0
it has since emerged that a further £ 1 million - worth of public money has been lavished so far this year on the transforming apartment into a home fit for a future king and queen			2
while @entity28 and @entity2 are footing the bill for decoration and other ‘ soft furnishings ’ personally ( and it is understood that this will include a state - of - the - art new kitchen ) all structural work , rewiring , re-plastering and the installation of new environmentally - friendly heating and hot water systems , is being met by the government			1
so far the bill is £ 600,000 and rising , much of which is down to the discovery of potentially lethal asbestos			0
a further £ 400,000 of taxpayer funds has also been spent on a new roof			0
@entity63 , we can also reveal , is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the @entity8 , one of the largest art collections in the world which is held in trust by the @entity120 for the nation , with which to furnish her new home			2
the collection is comprised of more than a million objects d’art collated by successive kings and queens over the past 500 years			2
although it is a charitable institution whose objective is to preserve and display these items in trust for the nation , one of the perks of being a member of the royal family is that they are also permitted to ‘ borrow ’ items to furnish their private homes			0
@entity2 is said to be having great fun in using her history of art degree to pick out some really special pieces – paintings in particular - but also display cases , dining tables and chairs			2
@entity63 is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the @entity8 to furnish her new apartment a palace source argued : ‘ it is the same for the @entity120 and other members of the @entity243 with regards to both their private residences and their offices			1
the alternative is [ that ] everything sits in storage			0
‘ contrary to reports that she has employed an interior designer , @entity2 has eschewed offers of professional help and is , it can be revealed , overseeing the work herself with the help of her private office			0
@entity63 , who has a history of art degree , is said to have ‘ a real interest in design ’ and has been encouraged by her father - in - law , prince @entity262 , to ‘ stamp her personality ’ on the project , albeit using @entity266 - sourced , environmentally - friendly products as much as possible , naturally			0
she has been seen perusing fabrics in the upmarket @entity268 in @entity269 but has also been seen shopping in department stores such as @entity271 and @entity272			0
‘ it ’s a big task but she ’s confident enough to know exactly what she wants and how she wants to do it , ’ said a source			0
although aides working for the @entity1 and @entity2 admit the works being carried out at @entity4 are ‘ extensive ’ , they insist that costs will be kept to a ‘ bare minimum ’ and maintain much of the outlay will fall to the couple privately			1
‘ currently , the apartment is totally uninhabitable without major structural works being carried out and the only public money being used is for remedial work to turn the apartment back into living accommodation , ’ said one			0
‘ the cost of any interior decorating and soft furnishings beyond basic re-plastering and painting and the like will be met by the @entity243 privately			0
‘ the couple are insistent that any costs to the public must be kept to the bare minimum			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ it is important to note that the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that princess @entity127 and @entity148 moved into the apartment , following their marriage in 1960			0

@entity2 loved shopping at @entity41 while @entity28 was on @entity310 *patrol*
@entity63 picked up a faux leather letter rack for £ 22.99
she also bought a red ' love ' pillow for just £ 9.99
the royal couple has lived on @entity29 for the past three years
they are due to move into @entity4 this week with @entity13
apartment has a night and day nursery , staff rooms and five sitting rooms
