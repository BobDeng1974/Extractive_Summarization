children of illegal immigrants would be banned from schools under plans drawn up for ministers to curb the impact of ‘ education tourists ’			1
the idea was put forward by officials told to find ways to limit migrants ’ access to benefits , housing , and the @entity14 but has been blocked by ministers			1
but @entity17 ’s pledge to end the global perception of @entity19 being a ‘ soft touch ’ have been slammed as ‘ unfortunate ’ by @entity22 prime minister @entity21			1
but it has emerged officials have begun examining how to limit access to free education for children who are in the country illegally			1
it is estimated that there could be 120,000 children in the @entity19 without legal immigration status			1
one plan would require headteachers to check the immigration status of pupils before admitting them to lessons			1
the idea has been put forward in a series of emails sent by officials advising the inter-ministerial group on migrants ' access to benefits and public services , @entity56 reported			1
the group includes schools minister @entity25 and immigration minister @entity24			0
a proposal to ban illegal immigrant children from schools was suggested , but there are warnings it could contravene the @entity73 convention on the rights of the child			1
mr @entity25 is said to consider the idea a ‘ red line ’			0
@entity17 this week used a speech to promise to tackle @entity19 's reputation as being a ' soft touch ' on immigration one email sent by a civil servant on monday said : ‘ barring children , whatever their migrant status , from compulsory education has pretty much been ruled out by ministers and at the moment is off the table for cross-government discussions			1
‘ the question now is whether , if not to enforce a ban , it would nevertheless be helpful to carry out migrant status checks as part of school admissions			0
’ another email suggested ‘ strategies could probably be employed to deal with “ education tourists ” , in much the same [ way ] as “ health tourists ” are managed ’			0
the plan was revealed by @entity103 mp @entity102 who accused minister of being ‘ diverted to policy stunts prepared for prime ministerial statements and speeches ’ instead of focussing on practical ways to tackle immigration			2
he told the @entity110 that ‘ ministerial attention has recently been focused on discussions in the inter-ministerial group on barring migrant children from compulsory education ’			1
he said the @entity116 then intervened and the children ’s rights adviser said : ‘ if we were to withdraw the right of education from any children in the @entity19 , regardless of their status , we would be hugely criticised for it by the @entity73			1
mr @entity17 promised to restrict migrants ' rights to unemployment , health and housing benefits ‘ with the periodic review report due to be submitted in january 2014 , this would be very controversial			1
’ home secretary @entity130 played down the idea of banning children outright			2
she said : ‘ we have been looking at public services across the board in relation to what we describe as the pull factors			0
‘ we have focused on housing , health and the benefits system			2
we do not propose not having the provision of education for individual children			2
’ but she rejected the claim that the government ’s policy changes were about publicity stunts			0
‘ we have been sorting out a chaotic immigration system and immigration policy introduced by the previous government that led to net migration in this country reaching hundreds of thousands a year			0
‘ we aim to bring it down to tens of thousands			0
we have already seen net migration cut by a third			0
that is not a publicity stunt ; it is a real benefit and a policy that the people of this country want to see			0
’ the move to consider targeting illegal immigrant children was condemned by @entity164 , head of policy at the @entity166 of @entity167			2
she said : ‘ you ca n't hold children responsible for the behaviours of their parents , it 's simply not fair			1
‘ all of our codes of practice around admissions , behaviour and exclusions have always emphasised that you deal with the child and not the parents in terms of their access to education and their treatment within the school			2
we would n't want to see anything jeopardise that			0
‘ it 's also really worrying to start to drag schools into politics in this way			2
yes , we are public servants , part of the state , but once you put that process in place , i 'd suggest you 're encouraging parents who are worried about their immigration status to avoid putting their children into school , to avoid detection			0
that puts the educational rights of that child at risk			1
’ @entity22 prime minister @entity21 said mr @entity17 's speech was ' unfortunate ' mr @entity17 ’s speech on monday focussed on benefits and housing , but was criticised for lacking detail and targeting relatively small numbers of people			1
he promised that new @entity215 migrants will be stripped of jobless benefits after six months , but critics said existing rules meant this effectively already happened			2
the pm said net migration needs to ‘ come down radically ’ after getting ‘ badly out of control ’ under @entity103			0
he also unveiled a crackdown on so - called health tourism , with hospitals ordered to start charging foreign visitors			0
those from outside the @entity215 will need health insurance before being granted a visa			0
there will be a major shake - up of council housing rules designed to keep immigrant families off waiting lists for at least two years and possibly as many as five			0
but the speech was criticised by the @entity22 prime minister			2
mr @entity21 said : ‘ i think it 's unfortunate			1
i believe in a @entity237 that should be open , where we have free movement , and where we instead ask ourselves how people who come here can get work more easily			0

leaked emails reveal officials proposed barring pupils from lessons
plan would fall foul of @entity73 convention on the rights of the child
ministers consider asking children to prove they are @entity19 legally
@entity22 's @entity21 says @entity19 moves to limit benefits for migrants is ' unfortunate '
