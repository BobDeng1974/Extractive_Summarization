by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 23:46 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 12 november 2013 @entity3 's greedy energy firms were today accused by the government of treating their customers like ' cash cows ' which can be ' squeezed ' to increase profits			1
energy secretary @entity8 used a speech today to point the finger at power bosses for behaving as badly as disgraced banker @entity12 , who presided over the collapse of @entity15			1
as the industry accused the minister of ' tit for tat insults ' , @entity16 announced rises 3.9 per cent amid reports @entity22 will push up prices by 6.6 per cent , much lower than the hikes of up to 10 per cent imposed by the rest of the @entity26			1
how bills will soar mr @entity8 used a speech to the energy industry 's annual conference to launch the most outspoken attack so far on bosses from the so - called @entity26 of @entity16 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity22			1
he accused them of greed for ramping up prices for consumers while wholesale prices are barely increasing			0
@entity22 is expected to raise its charges by 6.6 per cent this month , becoming the fifth of the top six energy firms to increase fees by more than twice the rate of inflation , according to the @entity48			1
about four million homes will be hit by the rise , with customers on non-fixed tariffs paying an extra £ 90 per year			1
meanwhile , @entity16 announced its bills will go up by just 3.9 per cent , much lower than the crippling rises announced by the rest of the @entity26			1
but it appeared to threaten the government that if it fails to cut green levies it will have to ' review ' its prices , paving the way for another increase			1
squeeze : energy secretary @entity8 warned power firms not to hike bills just to maximise profits @entity35 bills are going up by 9 per cent , @entity33 announced a 10.4 per cent price hike , @entity34 a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity36 an 8.2 per cent increase			1
energy regulator @entity68 says the amount of profit raised from bills has doubled in a year , while the wholesale costs of gas and electricity have remained almost unchanged			1
@entity75 , energy expert at @entity77 , said : ' any winter price rise is a blow to consumers as it makes the struggle to afford to stay warm that little bit harder			2
' however , @entity83 is to be applauded for the stance it is taking by factoring in the potential reduction on green levies into its calculations			0
' this means that customers will know upfront that they will benefit from any step the government takes to reduce the impact of ' hidden ' taxes on bills			2
' more importantly it also challenges the government to put its money where its mouth is and to make good its pledges on affordability			0
' in his speech mr @entity8 conceded that power firms have to make profits to invest in infrastructure			2
but he told industry umbrella group @entity107 , he will warn : ' those profits can not come at the expense of the elderly , the vulnerable and the poorest in our society			0
' customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders			0
' and frankly the latest round of bill rises have not been fully and openly justified			0
' when people see energy bills rising way above inflation , year on year , you can understand the anger and frustration this causes			2
' people fear shareholder interests are being put in front of the needs of families and the fuel poor			0
' money to burn ... @entity22 will raise its charges by 6.6 per cent this month , becoming the fifth of the top six energy firms to increase prices the announcement by @entity139 - owned power firm @entity16 that its prices will rise by just 3.9 per cent sparked immediate questions about why other firms ' increase are more than twice as high			1
the @entity26 have argued that rising wholesale costs and green levies mean they have no choice but to increase bills			1
@entity35 bills are going up by 9 per cent , @entity33 announced a 10.4 per cent price hike , @entity34 a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity36 an 8.2 per cent increase			1
but @entity16 chief executive @entity152 said : ' the best way to help customers is for us to keep our prices as low as possible			1
' i know that price rises are always unwelcome , but we have taken the first step to show what can be done if rising costs are tackled head - on			0
' the lower rise was welcomed by campaign groups			2
@entity166 , executive director of which ? , said : ' while any increase is bad news for hard - pressed consumers , today 's announcement will make people question why other major suppliers have hit their customers so much harder			1
' people want to hear more than just tough talk from the politicians - they want to see tough new action to fix our broken energy market , not tinkering at the edges while consumers grapple with the rising cost of living			2
' mr @entity8 said the government is looking at how it could reduce the impact of its policies on bills			1
' but our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible			0
' the industry must be much more transparent and @entity68 will have our full support to introduce whatever regulations are necessary to deliver that greater transparency			0
' @entity198 and @entity199 are holding talks this week on how to remove green levies from energy bills which add more than £ 100 to costs for every customer			2
it is thought the @entity206 , which raises money to pay for insulation and other efficiency measures , will be funded from general taxation instead			0
ministers are desperate to find a way to save at least £ 60 - a - year from bills , in order to boast that they have cut costs by more than the £ 120 over 20 months which @entity217 leader @entity216 claims his bills freeze would save			1
energy @entity3 said 95 per cent of rising costs were out of the hands of the industry			0
and it hit back at mr @entity8 's outspoken criticism of their business practices			1
a spokesman said : ' the energy industry is already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter			0
' the best way to do this is for everyone to work together which is why this tit for tat @entity236 show of insults is so unproductive			2
' the energy industry is vital to the @entity3			0
it is a major employer , a serious investor and a significant taxpayer			0
' speaking at today 's conference , energy @entity3 's chief executive @entity242 said the industry had a problem of trust as a result of increases in bills			2
' we have got a problem - an image problem , a reputational problem , a trust problem , ' she said			0
' trust is hard to gain and it 's easy to lose			0
' energy bills have risen for well - known reasons , reasons that the industry has made quite clear			2
' ms @entity242 defended the profits made by energy firms , saying : ' profitability is a good thing , it 's not a bad thing			0
' that profitability maintains the industry and , when it pays dividends , it pays for pensions as well			0
' @entity270 , @entity217 's shadow energy secretary , said : ' @entity198 's out of touch government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost - of - living crisis			1
' @entity8 and the @entity277 had a chance to support @entity217 's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the @entity281 and the energy companies			1
it just goes to show you ca n't trust a word they say			0
