she has now adopted @entity74 , who says she finally feels like she ' belongs in the world ' ' my adoptive dad told me i had a half - brother and half - sister , so i wondered if i was the product of an affair or perhaps @entity18 had been widowed			1

after a change in law , @entity3 could receive basic details about her birth parents			1

it was an amazing day			0
' @entity3 revealed that she even told her own children what had happened			2
she said : ' i 'd always felt compelled to adopt children so we did that before we had our own			0
' they know their biological grandfather was a bad man who hurt @entity144			0
i do n't see a reason to hide that			0
' sadly @entity3 's relationship with her adoptive parents was not as strong and they severed contact			1
@entity3 said : ' in 2010 , i asked @entity18 if she and her husband @entity150 , who was n't with her when i was born , might adopt me			2
' they thought it was a great idea			0
i 'm @entity150 's first child so we had a big party with ' it 's a girl ' balloons			0
' when i was young i felt like i had to justify why i 'm here			0
i was n't planned or wanted			0
mum almost had me aborted			0
