by @entity0 in @entity1 it has confused scientists for decades - how how do @entity5 butterflies manage to navigate 2,000 miles from breeding sites across the eastern @entity7 to fir trees in central @entity9			1
researchers first found they used the sun - but then found they could still navigate on overcast days			1
now they believe they have finally solved the mystery - the insects have an internal magnetic compass			2
a monarch butterfly eats nectar from a swamp milkweed on the shore of @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 : researchers say the insects use an internal magnetic compass to help navigate on their annual migrations from @entity26 to central @entity9			1
each fall millions of monarch butterflies use a sophisticated navigation system to transverse 2,000 miles from breeding sites across the eastern @entity7 to an overwintering habitat in specific groves of fir trees in central @entity9			1
tagged insects have shown they can travel over 250 miles in a day			1
the new research in the journal @entity35 was carried out by scientists at @entity37 and @entity38			0
' taken as a whole , our study reveals another fascinating aspect of the monarch butterfly migratory behavior , ' said author @entity44			0
' greater knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the fall migration may well aid in its preservation , currently threatened by climate change and by the continuing loss of milkweed and overwintering habitats			0
' a new vulnerability to now consider is the potential disruption of the magnetic compass in the monarchs by human - induced electromagnetic noise , which can also affect geomagnetic orientation in migratory birds			2
' co-author @entity60 , phd , assistant professor of biology and biotechnology at @entity38 , said : ' our study shows that monarchs use a sophisticated magnetic inclination compass system for navigation similar to that used by much larger - brained migratory vertebrates such as birds and sea turtles			1
' monarchs use a time - compensated sun compass in their antenna to help them make their 2,000 mile migratory journey to overwintering sites			1
during the absence of daylight cues , such as under dense cloud cover , migrants have been , surprisingly , seen flying in the expected southerly direction			0
it ’s been hypothesized that monarchs use geomagnetic cues to help navigate when day light cues are unavailable to them during migration			2
the nsects also use the sun to get their route right using flight simulators equipped with artificial magnetic fields , @entity92 , @entity60 , a postdoctoral fellow in the @entity44 lab , examined monarch flight behavior under diffuse white light conditions			1
he found that tethered monarchs in the simulators oriented themselves in a southerly direction			0
further tests in the simulator revealed that the butterflies used the inclination angle of @entity105 ’s magnetic field to guide their movement			0
reversing the direction of the inclination caused the monarchs to orient in the opposite direction , to the north instead of the south			0
monarch butterflies are collected in a net to be tested for the ophroyocystis elektroscirrha parasite that inhibits their flight , at @entity118 reserve , near @entity119 , @entity9			1
further work suggested the compass is in the antennae			0
' for migratory monarchs , the inclination compass may serve as an important back up system when daylight cues are unavailable , ' @entity123 said			2
' it may also augment hand - in - hand with the time - compensated sun compass to provide orientation and directionality throughout the migration process			0
' the next step for @entity44 and colleagues will be to evaluate the molecular and genetic mechanisms of magneto - reception in the monarch butterfly and the involvement of @entity141 .			0

@entity143 used to navigate 2,000 miles from @entity7 to central @entity9
insects also use the sun to get their route right
similar system used by birds and sea turtles
