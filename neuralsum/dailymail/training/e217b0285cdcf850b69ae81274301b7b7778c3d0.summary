the controversial inventor behind the @entity2 printed gun has revealed his latest project - a $ 1200 milling machine to make untraceable rifles			1
called the @entity8 , the @entity7 mill can produce metal parts to built a rifle			1
the rifle does not have a serial number , and is therefore known as a ' ghost ' gun			1
the finished rifle : the parts are combined to make a fully functioning assault rifle although the machine is a standard @entity7 milling machine used to make aluminium parts , it has been set up to work in a unique way			1
rather than creating a gun from scratch , it adapt a part known as an ' 80 % lower '			2
this is the body of the gun that connects its stock , barrel , magazine and other parts			1
if you purchase a pre milled ' 80 % lower ' , a piece that is 80 % complete and totally legal , you can clamp it into the machine , hit a button and it will do the rest			1
by milling the part at home , and buying the rest of the parts online , which are not controlled , it is possible to build a semi-automatic weapon with no serial number , a weapon some gun control advocates call a ' ghost gun '			1
@entity55 's previous creations have included @entity2 printable plastic magazines and the defender gun wrong brought it worldwide attention earlier this year			2
@entity60 , the man behind the firm , says the new product is the ' gold standard '			0
' @entity2 [ guns ] was about signaling the future , ' he told @entity66			0
' this is about the present			0
' you can use this machine today to create something to the standards you 're used to … the gold standard of the gun community is metal			1
' the machine works in a unique way			2

it is also the part of a gun that is most licensed			2
by milling the part at home , and buying the rest of the parts online , which are not controlled , it is possible to build a semi-automatic weapon with no serial number , a weapon some gun control advocates call a ' ghost gun '			1
favored by target shooters in competitions and by hunters who stalk small game and sometimes deer , the @entity110 is the most popular rifle in @entity117			1
police believe that an @entity110 was used by 23 - year - old @entity119 last year to kill five people in a rampage through @entity122 before he was himself killed by police			2
it was also the weapon of choice for @entity126 in @entity127 , and @entity128 in @entity129			0
it fires a 5.56mm , or .223 caliber bullet			0
magazines for the weapon ( that are in circulation in the @entity117 ) range from 5 to 100 rounds			0
with proper training , a shooter can effectively and accurately empty a 30 - round magazine in less than a minute			0
selling that untraceable gun body is illegal , no law prevents you from making one			2
the firm boasts anyone can use the machine			0
' just follow a few simple instructions to mount your 80 % lower receiver , tighten a couple screws ( with simple tools we provide ) , and on day one , @entity152 can help you legally manufacture unserialized firearms in the comfort of your own home			0
' the release of the kit , which has sold out its first run , follows a debate in @entity160 over a state law that would ban the manufacture of all guns without serial numbers			1
the bill , widely known as the ' ghost gun ban ' and introduced by @entity168 state senator @entity167 earlier this year was designed to criminalize either @entity2 printing or finishing an 80 percent lower without a government - assigned serial number in @entity160			1
the legislation passed @entity160 's senate and assembly , but was vetoed by the state 's governor @entity175 , who wrote that he ' ca n't see how adding a serial number to a homemade gun would significantly advance public safety			1
' ' you can have an unserialized toothbrush , and you can have an unserialized rifle , ' @entity60 told @entity66			0
' this is important to me			0
' the untraceable firearm is my stand			0
' the machine is small enough to be used at home - and costs just $ 1299			0
the machine is available to preorder online @entity55 said it decided to build its machine from the ground up			2
' we found existing @entity7 machines too expensive , too @entity194 , or too inaccurate to manufacture firearms for the casual user			0
' by miniaturizing the build envelope to just large enough to mill common firearm receivers , we were able to improve rigidity , reduce material cost and simultaneously relax some design limits , allowing us to sell an inexpensive machine with more than enough accuracy to manufacture firearms			0
' all @entity207 schematics and design files will be published into the public domain , ' the firm said .			0

allows anyone to create an @entity110 assault rifle from parts that can be bought online *freely*
machine *preprogrammed* to create rifle parts at the press of a button
launched as *protest* against ' ghost gun ' *row* in @entity160
first run of machine sold out within hours
