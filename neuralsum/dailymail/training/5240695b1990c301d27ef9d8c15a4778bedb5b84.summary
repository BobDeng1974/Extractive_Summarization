cleared : dr @entity0 has been cleared of carrying out female genital mutilation a doctor who became the first person in the @entity4 to stand trial over female genital mutilation was sensationally cleared yesterday			1
a jury took fewer than 25 minutes to acquit @entity8 of carrying out the potentially lethal procedure on a new mother			1
he was cleared along with a co-defendant , 41 - year - old @entity11 , whose lawyer said the verdict showed the failed case had been a @entity17 ‘ show trial ’			1
@entity18 and friends who had supported them throughout the two - week trial cried ‘ yes ’ as the verdicts were read out			1
dr @entity0 had been accused of illegally stitching a 24 - year - old woman back up after she gave birth , redoing the mutilation she suffered as a six - year - old in @entity27			2
the prosecution had been hailed as a landmark in the campaign to stamp out the illegal practice			0
but dr @entity0 said he had simply put in a stitch to stop the woman bleeding after a traumatic emergency labour at @entity35 in north @entity36 in 2012			1
he said in a statement yesterday : ‘ i am extremely relieved with the court ’s verdict and i am grateful to the jury for their careful consideration of the facts			2
‘ i have always maintained that @entity43 is an abhorrent practice that has no medical justification ‘ i would like to thank my family , friends , legal team and all those who supported me through this difficult time and i look forward to putting this matter behind me			1
’ dr @entity8 , pictured standing in a court sketch , was found not guilty by a jury after a trial at @entity56 in which he claimed to have been used as a ' scapegoat ' by hospital bosses mr @entity11 's lawyer , @entity59 , said : ‘ my client has suffered months of stress and the humiliation and lost precious time with his two young children			1
‘ my client strongly believes this case was nothing more than a show trial – an effort by the @entity17 to regain some confidence after failing to bring a prosecution despite @entity43 laws being in place since 1985			1
’ last night , the @entity17 faced questions over why it had decided to bring a case against the highly regarded doctor and mr @entity11 , who he had not even met before the incident on november 24 , 2012			2
the alleged victim , who was herself taken to a police station where she was fingerprinted and had dna samples taken , never supported the case			1
and even prosecutor @entity82 pointed out that the case was a far cry from the stereotype of the ‘ back street clinic ’			2
the alleged victim fled civil war in @entity27 in the 1990s , settling in @entity4 where she got a job at a @entity36 hotel and married			1
as a result of the @entity43 she was unable to have sex with her new husband and in 2011 , she underwent defibulation – reversal of the procedure			1
this medical history was not considered when she went into labour at the @entity98 , aged 27			2
miss @entity99 told @entity56 in south @entity36 : ‘ we do suggest that dr @entity0 has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the @entity35 and their failings			0
yet he is the one paying the price for the hospital ’s ineptitude			0
’ mr @entity11 , who was acting as the woman ’s interpreter , had instructed him to do it , the prosecution said			0
but he was cleared of inciting @entity43			1
dr @entity0 insisted he was not a ‘ puppet ’ who would give into patient ’s demands			0
the victim , who had to give evidence about intimate medical procedures , was also against @entity43			1
she told the court she did not want it as she wanted to continue having sex with her husband and they wanted more children			0
' scapegoat ' : bosses at @entity35 , pictured , were accused of exploiting dr @entity0 in order to cover up systemic failings she went on to have another child , suffering no problems following the procedure by @entity131 , who is from @entity132			1
last night , @entity133 , a barrister and @entity135 campaigner , questioned the @entity17			0
‘ i was concerned about this prosecution because all the evidence pointed to a young doctor who was not adequately prepared for the circumstances which faced him , ’ she said			0
‘ i have not felt adequate training is available to professionals – doctors , nurses , police , teachers and social workers			0
’ @entity147 , consultant gynaecologist and head of obstetrics at @entity150 , in east @entity36 , questioned the decision to charge at the time , describing it as a ‘ political prosecution ’			0
she said last night : ‘ such good news about the verdict – now we can get back to trying to stop @entity43 happening and support all the doctors and midwives who have been terrified by this case			1
’ @entity160 , the @entity161 , defended the @entity17 ’s decision to take the case to trial saying it did not ‘ shy away from difficult cases ’			2
‘ it was right that we put this case before the court and on three separate occasions , once before trial and twice during the trial , the judge dismissed applications by the defence to stop the case , thereby agreeing that the evidence should be considered by a jury , ’ she said			1
‘ the @entity17 does not choose which cases it is asked to consider for prosecution and we must apply the same test to every case			0
this will , of course , not affect our resolve to bring those who do commit @entity43 to justice where we have the evidence to do so			2
’ the practice of female genital mutilation dates back at least 2,000 years and was used in ancient @entity190 as a sign of distinction amongst the aristocracy			0
the @entity194 , a @entity4 - based charity , said primitive societies believed the procedure would ensure women ’s virginity and lead to a reduction in female desire			1
in some cultures , it is valued as a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood but others believe it is a means of preserving a girl ’s virginity until marriage			0
in most of these countries @entity43 is a pre-requisite for marriage , with marriage being vital to a woman ’s social and economic survival			1
@entity43 is rooted in culture and some believe it is carried out for religious reasons			2
although not confined to a particular culture or religion , it is most common in @entity223			0
female genital mutilation is illegal in the @entity4 under laws introduced in 1985			2
this legislation was strengthened and updated in 2003 by a private member ’s bill introduced by the @entity230 mp @entity229			0
under this law , which came into force in march 2004 , it is a crime to carry out , aid or abet any form of @entity43			2
the penalties were also increased significantly and allowed the courts to impose prison sentences of between five and 14 years on those who carry out the procedure or on parents who allow their children to be mutilated			0
but the failed prosecution in the @entity0 case that finished yesterday raises questions about future proceedings			0
seven other cases are under investigation and three are with the cps for consideration			0
there are also 11 cases in which the @entity17 decided there should be no further action and one case in which the police decided not to press ahead .			0
