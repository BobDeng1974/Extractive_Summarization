a second spectacular blast from the @entity1 in southern @entity2 has covered nearby towns and villages in a thick layer of ash			1
the first eruption in over four decades yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air , creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night 's sky			1
another unexpected eruption in the @entity16 today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated , residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded			2
the ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway			1
previous and equally violent eruptions at @entity1 have continued for up to a week , according to a volcanologist from @entity31 who told @entity32 it is impossible to predict what will happen next			1
the volcano is one of the most dangerous of @entity2 's 90 active volcanoes but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time yesterday			1
emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert			2
even professor @entity133 who has studied over a century of eruptions across @entity2 's 1000 - mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the @entity139 to @entity140			1
he ranked this particular explosion ' a three or four ' on the @entity143 which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere			2
professor @entity133 told @entity32 : ' based on a 15km - high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half , that ’s quite strong			0
this particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years			0
' sometimes it has lasted a day and other times it has bubbled on for a few weeks			0
the activity ’s died down for the moment but we do n’t know what ’s going to happen next			0
' many people in @entity2 are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health , adding : ' we woke up today with a blanket of fog and it has n't cleared			1
we have a layer of smoke above us			0
' a 30 - year - old from @entity49 admitted many people in @entity2 are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health , adding : ' we woke up today with a blanket of fog and it has n't cleared			1
we have a layer of smoke above us			0
' ' people went into a state of panic ' as the ash cloud spread , according to @entity178 who lives in @entity111 14 miles away			1
he added : ' i heard a loud noise as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb			0
' abandoned : @entity2 's president @entity183 has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured since the first explosion yesterday volatile : @entity183 said this eruption at @entity98 is ' more serious and unpredictable ' than that of the @entity190 volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people covered : resident of the @entity194 ( pictured ) near @entity1 struggled to clear the mountains of ash that had built up on their rooves locked out : local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano protection : even residents in the @entity209 city of @entity210 ( pictured ) donned gas masks to avoid the respiratory damage caused by the ash from @entity1 deadly : smoke and lava spew from the @entity1 volcano , as seen from the shores of @entity218 in @entity49 which is over 18 miles away ' even small amounts of ash can be really quite disruptive , ' according to professor @entity133 who added : ' it affects power supplies and it can be disruptive to agriculture			1
you do n’t need particularly thick accumulations of ash to start to have physical consequences			0
' @entity2 's president @entity183 has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured and the only person who went missing since the first explosion was found on thursday			1
she said this eruption at @entity98 is ' more serious and unpredictable ' than that of the @entity190 volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people			2
the director of a radio station in @entity111 described how hundreds of locals rushed to get gas following the eruption , forcing stations to ration their sales			1
and supermarkets closed their doors to avoid being looted			0
@entity248 airlines has cancelled flights to and from @entity111 because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines			1
a volcano in the @entity253 of southern @entity2 erupted violently in 2011 , forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people			1
stiff winds blew the ash from that explosion over the border to @entity209 where the thick , abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of @entity210			0
and by thursday afternoon , much ash had made its way to @entity267 , @entity209 , a small town about 56 miles ( 90 kilometers ) northeast of the volcano			2
cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash , but people were otherwise going about their business			0
' we are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible , ' said mayor @entity277			0
the @entity278 issued a high alert on wednesday and set up an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the volcano			0
ominous : the first eruption ( pictured ) sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away active : @entity98 ( pictured yesterday ) is one of @entity2 's three most dangerous volcanoes and part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country incredible : smoke and lava shot out of @entity1 yesterday as people watched on from the shores of @entity218 in @entity49 ( pictured ) explosion : residents in nearby @entity49 ( pictured ) went about their business as @entity302 exploded , but local authorities setting up a 12.5 - mile exclusion zone around it destructive : volcanoes like @entity98 ( pictured ) occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth 's crust plume : while most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava , many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash ( pictured ) which is pushed through the earth 's crust , covering the sky @entity322 who lives in @entity48 - some six miles from the volcano - said the eruption yesterday happened without warning			1
@entity98 's last major eruption happened in 1961 , with a weak eruption following in 1972			1
he said : ' it sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road , rattling and shaking , guttural rumbling ... we left everything there , grabbed my kid , my dog , got in the car with my wife			0
mr @entity322 , who was originally born in @entity340 , said he was now driving his family to @entity49			2
he added : ' all the neighbors were outside , a lot of young people crying			0
' television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom - shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it			0
the eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring @entity209			2
@entity353 , a resident of @entity49 , said : ' there are a lot of people out in the streets , many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas			2
a friend told me to fill everything we have with water			0
' @entity2 , on the @entity365 ' , has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after @entity369 , including around 500 that are potentially active			2
in march , volcano @entity371 , also in southern @entity2 , erupted in spectacular fashion , sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky , but quickly subsided			1
volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth 's crust , either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another			0
eruptions occur when magma from the @entity388 's core forces its way to the surface , exploding through weak points in the crust			0
danger : residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time shocking : while the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon , the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in @entity209 blanket : the last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake distant : a view of the ash cloud from the @entity415 , around 100 miles away from the volcano in neighbouring @entity209			1

a second terrifying eruption from the @entity1 in southern @entity2 has forced over 4,000 to leave their homes
the cities of @entity49 and @entity111 are covered in ash and locals are becoming frightened for their health
yesterday 's blast , which shot ash six miles into the air , was the first since 1972 and the first major one since 1961
no one is thought to have died from the two explosions but @entity2 's president has declared a state of emergency
