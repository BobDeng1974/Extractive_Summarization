communities secretary @entity7 has lashed out at rules which allow so - called ‘ @entity10 ’ officials to target law - abiding householders who make genuine mistakes			1
instead , local authorities will be restricted to issuing penalties to those who commit a ‘ public nuisance ’ by allowing bags to pile up or who fly - tip their rubbish			1
new law : councils will be banned by law from fining families who put their bin out at the wrong time or do not close its lid mr @entity7 said yesterday that , under the previous @entity27 government , @entity25 bureaucrats had too much leeway to fine householders for minor breaches			2
he added : ‘ for too long @entity27 ’s barmy bin rules have allowed local authorities to slap fines on law - abiding people who make innocent mistakes			1
‘ putting out your rubbish should be a simple process , and it is ludicrous that we have a system where a milk carton in the wrong recycling container or a wheelie bin a few inches out of place can lead to people facing similar fines to shoplifters			0
‘ we ’re bringing common sense back with a new law to rein in bin bullies which ensures that councils only issue fines to persistent and deliberate offenders			0
’ critic : communities secretary @entity7 said yesterday that , under the previous @entity27 government , @entity25 bureaucrats had too much leeway to fine householders for minor breaches in 2005 , the @entity27 government introduced fixed penalty notices of up to £ 110 for offences of putting rubbish out on the wrong day , not closing the bin lid , placing a rubbish bag next to a full wheelie bin , or putting recyclable goods out with normal rubbish			1
meanwhile , the penalty for shoplifters who stole goods worth under £ 100 was only £ 80			0
from july 1 , a change will be made to the @entity73 , which mainly reduces the burden of excessive regulation on businesses , to ensure fixed penalty notices are handed out to householders only in cases where there has been ‘ harm to the local amenity ’			0
mr @entity7 said the strict rules have been disproportionately hitting law - abiding people , while under @entity27 only 0.05 per cent of genuine fly - tipping incidents were ever successfully prosecuted by local authorities			1
under the amendments to the @entity89 , householders can be fined only if they cause a nuisance , damage the local area – such as those who allow stinking rubbish to pile up outside their house , or repeatedly fail to comply with the rules			2
the government has also promised to help bring back weekly bin collections , but this has not happened widely			0
despite putting up a £ 250million fund to encourage councils to collect bins once a week rather than once a fortnight , only 85 councils have applied for the cash .			0

communities secretary @entity7 has lashed out at *current* rules
he said the laws target homeowners who make ' genuine mistakes '
instead authorities will penalise those who commit a ' public nuisance '
