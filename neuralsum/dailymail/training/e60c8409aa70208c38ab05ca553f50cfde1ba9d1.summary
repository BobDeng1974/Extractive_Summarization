@entity1 manager @entity0 has warned @entity3 counterpart @entity2 to expect a far rougher ride on saturday compared to their recent stroll against @entity7			1
the @entity3 head into their latest @entity9 clash with @entity1 on a high after hammering the woeful @entity10 8 - 0 last saturday			1
on the back of a run of five wins in their last six league matches , @entity2 's side are a heady third in the table and will no doubt be confident of adding @entity1 to their recent list of scalps			1
' it was an outstanding result , ' said @entity0 of @entity3 's win over the @entity7			1
' it does n't matter at what level you play			2
to beat another team 8 - 0 is an outstanding performance			0
' we go there with them on an obvious high given the performance and result , but we 're in a confident mood ourselves			0
' we won last time out , so we 'd like to think we 'll make a better fist of it - should i suggest			2
' we 'll recognise the talent and ability they have in their squad , but we 've plenty of that ourselves , so they know it will be a difficult game for them			0
' it 's up to us to make sure ( the win over @entity7 ) was a one - off performance and result , and is not something that will influence our game			1
' @entity3 striker @entity62 celebrates after scoring the fifth goal against @entity7 many experts have been surprised by what @entity3 have achieved so far this season given the departure of manager @entity68 over the summer to @entity69 along with the exit of a number of key players			1
@entity2 , however , has bought well in @entity0 ' eyes , with the likes of @entity62 and @entity75 in particular immediately taking to life in the @entity9			1
' when things change in such a short space of time it 's difficult because they lost their manager and they lost two or three key players who had been exceptional for them the year previously , ' added @entity0			1
' there was perhaps a fear if they did n't get the right players in , and the right manager , then there could be a difficulty			2
' but in fairness they have not had the issue of being unable to go into the market and spend good money			0
' they 've had a decent amount of money to work with that has enabled them to get good quality into the building			0
' after that , of course , you have the problem of getting the dynamic and balance right in the dressing room , but they seem to have done that , and that 's the impressive thing			0
' i 'm sure they 're very happy with how their season has gone because there was talk they would struggle - not a view i shared i have to say - but there is always that worry when you make changes			0
' back - to - back home wins - after starting the season with consecutive home defeats - have helped propel @entity1 up to a respectable 10th in the table			1
@entity0 feels after the early - season blip the critics were too hasty to write off his team , adding : ' at the beginning of the year i think everybody 's view was shaped very , very quickly			2
' as a consequence of losing our first two home games people assumed we 'd had a really poor start , which was n't really the case			0
' we 've done okay , and now we 've had back - to - back home wins which have really encouraged us , and we 've been okay on our travels , probably better than we were this time last year			0
' so we 're quite happy with where we are at the moment			0
' @entity0 goes into the game at @entity143 's without midfielder @entity144 who has a fractured leg sustained on international duty , while full - back @entity147 is doubtful with a back problem .			2
