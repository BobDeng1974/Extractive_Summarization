international criminals are using @entity3 property as their preferred ‘ safe haven ’ to stash their corrupt money , a startling report claims			1
@entity6 @entity3 said 36,000 @entity8 properties are owned by hidden companies registered in offshore havens			1
they fear many of these are being used by corrupt overseas politicians from the world ’s poorest countries who want to hide their criminal cash			0
a new report has revealed that thousands of homes in @entity8 are being bought anonymously by offshore companies so they can hide corrupt money ( file picture ) the charity said more than £ 180million worth of property in the @entity3 has been investigated by police as suspected proceeds of ‘ grand corruption ’ since 2004			1
the organisation defined ‘ grand corruption ’ as the theft and laundering of assets by foreign politicians , public officials and their associates from the developing world			0
more than three - quarters of these cases investigated by the @entity40 involved ‘ hidden ’ offshore companies , which makes it hard to identify the owner , the charity said			2
astonishingly , almost one in 10 properties in the @entity46 and one in 14 in @entity48 and @entity49 are owned by companies registered in offshore accounts			1
more than a third of foreign companies holding @entity8 property are incorporated in the @entity55 , followed by @entity56 , the @entity57 and @entity58			0
while many register their properties in offshore havens to avoid their tax obligations in @entity3 , campaigners say others do so to hide stolen assets			1
more than a third of foreign companies holding @entity8 property are incorporated in the @entity55 , pictured , followed by @entity56 , the @entity57 and @entity58 the charity has now called for the government to act quickly to ensure the @entity3 does not become ‘ the destination of choice for global corruption ’			1
they said analysis of documents from the @entity76 and the @entity77 showed this problem was on the rise			0
@entity80 , of @entity6 , said : ‘ there is growing evidence that the @entity3 property market has become a safe haven for corrupt capital stolen from around the world , facilitated by the laws which allow @entity3 property to be owned by secret offshore companies			1
‘ this has a devastating effect on the countries from which the money has been stolen , and it ’s hard to see how welcoming in the world ’s corrupt elite is beneficial to communities in the @entity3			2
‘ it is astonishing that the @entity3 has sleepwalked into this situation , and the government needs to act quickly to make sure that the @entity3 does not become the destination of choice for global corruption			1
’ they called for a new law requiring that the owners of companies which hold @entity3 properties are named in @entity76 documents			2
the @entity40 admitted that the current system meant ‘ it can take years to unpick the layers of corruption and secrecy which ultimately result in the purchase of @entity3 properties ’			2
more than three quarters of cases investigated by the @entity40 involved ‘ hidden ’ offshore companies a spokesman said : ‘ such properties are often owned by companies registered in foreign jurisdictions and while secrecy jurisdictions have been co-operative with our investigations , obtaining evidence can take years			1
’ @entity126 @entity125 , of @entity127 ’s @entity77 , said the @entity3 property market was attractive to criminal investors			0
he said : ‘ the @entity8 property market is attractive for many reasons , not least because of the safety of the investment and that it provides a home in this great capital			0
in nearly all the grand corruption cases we investigate , we find – what we suspect is – proceeds of corruption being used to purchase high - value properties			0
‘ properties that are purchased with illicit money , which is often stolen from some of the poorest people in the world , are nearly always layered through off - shore structures			0
’ he said that while the percentage of properties purchased with illicit money was tiny compared to the numbers of homes sold legitimately , the values of such houses were often huge			0
the average price of a @entity3 property under investigation for proceeds of corruption is £ 1.5million – more than five times more than the typical @entity3 house price .			0
