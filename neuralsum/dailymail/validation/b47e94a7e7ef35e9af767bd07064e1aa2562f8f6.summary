@entity0 hailed his @entity2 team as they fell agonisingly short of claiming their first @entity4 title in four years on an extraordinary , record - breaking day			1
after big wins by @entity6 and @entity7 , @entity2 knew they needed to beat @entity8 by 26 points at @entity10 to win the championship			1
they ran in seven tries in a brilliant display of attacking rugby to beat @entity8 55 - 35 but paid the price for a leaky defence — and wasting six try opportunities last week against @entity18			1
@entity0 ( centre left ) praised his @entity2 side 's courage but admitted he was ' gutted ' to lose out @entity0 looks dejected alongside his players at the end of the exciting @entity4 match @entity6 beat @entity25 61 - 20 in @entity26 , but saw their efforts then dashed by @entity7 's 40 - 10 victory over @entity18 at @entity29			1
@entity30 went over the line in the last few minutes but the try was disallowed — costing @entity34 's men the chance of a title			2
@entity2 scrum - half @entity37 , who scored two tries , said : ' i do n't really know what to say			1
' we really gave it a crack but for all the hard work we showed , you can not let them back in the game and we are just gutted			0
we knew that the @entity49 would tire but we just gave ourselves too much to climb in the end			0
' man - of - the - match @entity37 scored two tries for @entity2 but it was n't enough to claim the title @entity2 were defensively weak and made too many individual mistakes over the 80 minutes @entity0 added : ' we are gutted			1
it was one of the most courageous performances i have seen from a team			0
' but it is desperately disappointing not to get that try at the end			0
their first two tries hurt us and to come back as we did before half - time and then to concede the first try of the second half — it will go down as one of the great games of rugby			2
' to go down like we did and show the character to come back			0
it was an unbelievable game of rugby and it was desperately disappointing not to get that try at the end			0
' credit to @entity7 for winning the championship , they beat us and congratulations to @entity81 ( @entity82 ) and all his team			2

@entity2 needed just six more points against @entity8 to win the @entity4
