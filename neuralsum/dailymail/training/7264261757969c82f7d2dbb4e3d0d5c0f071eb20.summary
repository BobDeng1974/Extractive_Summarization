by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 30 july 2013 consumers might need to buy bigger and faster mobile price plans in order to feed data - hungry devices like @entity5 , according to experts			1
@entity8 technology guru @entity7 predicts wearable devices like @entity5 will be expensive for consumers as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by wireless carriers and users will have to upgrade their data plans			1
it is believed the device will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity			1
@entity8 technology guru @entity7 predicts wearable devices like @entity5 ( pictured ) will be expensive as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by wireless carriers and consumers will have to upgrade their data plans but it could also spark an increase in the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not taking advantage of the new technology			1
@entity32 glass connects to the internet by linking to the web via a mobile phone or tablet 's data plan - otherwise known as tethering - to create a mobile hotspot , the @entity30 reported			1
different networks have various rules and price plans for tethering , with many offering ' bolt - on ' packages , such as @entity45 's £ 3 bolt - no for @entity46 of data			2
some all - inclusive mobile contracts include tethering in the @entity50 , such as @entity52 's @entity51 , while others offer the service in specific bundles			0
mr @entity7 believes that just as the way we used to pay for access to the internet changed about a decade ago , the introduction of wearable technology - with its huge demand for data - will shake up the current way tethering is used and paid for			1
in the way that @entity66 made it possible to tether a number of computers to the same internet account , mobile phone providers will sell tetherable mobile broadband , he predicted			2
however , no - one is sure how much mobile tethering goes on today			0

different networks have various charges for using tethering			0
but a tech expert believes the introduction of wearable technology will shake up the current way tethering is used and paid for source : @entity32 if 10 per cent of @entity8 buy into @entity5 when it launches to the public , as they have hinted they might , tethering could be changed forever and go from a handy extra feature to an essential requirement in order to get @entity5 to work as advertised , mr @entity7 said			1
it is thought that this tethering service could be a massive source of income for mobile companies in the future			2
@entity96 , a @entity97 researcher and the former deputy chief economist of the @entity99 , told the @entity30 that if 35 million @entity8 did go out and buy @entity5 , it would put a huge strain on the country 's mobile infrastructure			1
he said that the @entity103 was a game - changer as it forced mobile carriers to build more data capacity and pushed people to pay for the data they used			2
' i think if @entity5 takes off , two similar things will happen , ' he said			0
mr @entity7 believes it is hard to predict whether @entity5 will use up more data than an average smartphone			2
however he calculates a five minute video clip recorded on the new device could need anywhere between 2.6 mb and 40.6 @entity116 to download the clip to @entity118 or stream the video depending on the quality of the film			0
it is believed @entity5 will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity but it could also spark an increase in the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not taking advantage of the new technology the way people use the device to tell stories and watch other people 's content may differ from what we expect , but their creative output will require an internet connection			1
mr @entity96 told the @entity30 other wearable devices like @entity145 's watch could become the ultimate tethered device , but if a number of options take off at once , it could have a compound effect on a country 's internet infrastructure			2
one strategy could be to siphon mobile data traffic off to @entity66			0
one study suggests that 46 per cent of data will be shunted over to @entity66 instead of using 3g and 4g networks by 2017 , but this percentage might have to increase if tethered devices like @entity5 take off			0
he told the @entity8 newspaper : ' we do n’t know if it ’s @entity5 that ’s going to be the one to take off , or @entity145 ’s @entity165 , if you ’ll excuse the expression			0
' but whatever it is			0
they either try to increase capacity or they try and take advantage of [ the lack of supply ] and raise prices			0
i think they ’ll do both			0
