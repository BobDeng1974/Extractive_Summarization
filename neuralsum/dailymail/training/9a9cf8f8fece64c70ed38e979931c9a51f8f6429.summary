by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 05:28 est , 5 april 2013 the sisters of child killer @entity2 claim she is a ' victim ' of her controlling husband @entity3 - but they can not forgive her for the deaths of their nieces and nephews			1
@entity8 and @entity9 told of their desperate attempts to convince her to leave @entity3 since they married in may 2003 , and take the children away			1
they claim @entity2 was so unhappy she had even attempted suicide in the months before the tragic fire			1
emotion : @entity2 weeps as she is sentenced to 17 years in prison for the manslaughter of her six children distraught : @entity21 , the father of @entity2 , hugs daughter @entity9 , outside @entity22 as his daughter was sentenced today distraught : @entity2 's sisters @entity8 , left , and @entity9 , right , told a @entity27 documentary how they tried on several occasions to rescue her from @entity2 's clutches without success but the family told @entity27 ultimately she put the man she described in court as her ' guardian angel ' above everything else			1
during the couple 's eight - week trial , @entity2 painted herself as a vulnerable character from a troubled background			1
born in @entity40 , she came from a traveller family and made allegations of abuse as a child , having been forced from school by bullies and raped in her teenage years			0
vulnerable : @entity2 was 19 and at ' rock bottom ' when she met @entity3 she was , she admitted , at ‘ rock bottom ’ when she met @entity2 aged just 19 , and jumped at the chance to move in with him			1
@entity2 gave birth to their first child @entity53 in august 2001 , followed by @entity55 in october 2002			1
they would go on to have three more children together			2
but while they were by then engaged , there was nothing conventional about their living arrangements because @entity2 had introduced a second woman , @entity63 , into the household			1
within weeks , their relationship had become sexual , the two women agreeing to take it in turns to share @entity2 ’s bed			1
despite this @entity71 agreed to marry @entity3 in may 2003			0
miss @entity63 even acted as bridesmaid at their wedding			0
in court she admitted she was ' hurt ' by his relationship with miss @entity63 but agreed to it because she did n't want to lose her family			0
sources said the women were expected to have sex with @entity2 virtually every day , and were ‘ on their backs ’ even when pregnant			1
so why did @entity2 put up with this ? her family say she was terrified of him , and that he isolated her and the children from those who cared about them			1
@entity8 and @entity9 told how the fragile peace which held the household together imploded after @entity63 finally had enough and left			1
@entity8 told @entity27 : ' we would try and get round there when he was doing the school run because we knew that he would n’t be in the house			2
' we told her that we could go to the school , we could go now ; go take the kids from school			0
we would get her out , but she just would n’t leave			0
' did the benefits system contribute to the @entity100 fire killings ? @entity2 once allowed the eldest child , @entity101 , 13 , to have a sleepover at @entity9 ’s house			1
@entity9 said the little boy was in a terrible state , adding : ' @entity3 said he had n’t eaten for a week and i took him and my little boy out for a pizza			2
' i had never seen a child eat so fast in my life			0
’ @entity2 's father @entity21 told @entity27 he has had difficulty accepting his daughter was responsible for the children 's deaths			1
he said : ' it ’s wrecking me inside , wrecking me ... i bottle a lot up away from my kids ... some nights i sit for hours in the dark			0
' neglect : @entity2 's sister @entity9 told how one of the children @entity101 , 13 , had once gone a week without eating the family have also dismissed @entity2 ’s claims in court that her father abused her as a child			1
police have confirmed the allegations were investigated at the time and found no evidence of any crime by @entity21			0
they also said there are no plans to follow up @entity2 ’s courtroom claim			1
@entity9 and @entity8 say it is not the first time their sister has made a false sex allegation			1
in court , @entity2 told the jury she 'd been raped on holiday as a teenager			2
her sister @entity8 says she was with her at the time of the alleged incident : ' i think it ’s just one of the many lies she tells			2
she got caught sleeping with a married man for money and she said she was raped			0
not only has she played a part in her children ’s deaths			2
it just seems that she will do anything to get out of it			0
' although @entity2 ’s sisters say they both believe she is a victim of @entity2 , they can not understand why she put him before the lives of all her children			1
@entity8 said : ' yeah			2
she is a victim of @entity3			0
but at the end of the day , when it comes to your kids , she should have put them first			2
she should have put the kids first			2
' disbelief : @entity21 says he still finds it hard to comprehend that his daughter was responsible for the deaths of six children sentencing @entity2 to 17 years in jail today , mrs justice @entity176 made it clear she did not regard @entity2 as a ' victim '			1
she said : ' i have already made clear that this was @entity2 's plan			2
i accept that he treated you as a skivvy or a slave , and you were prepared to put up with that			0
' as became clear during the trial you were prepared to go to any lengths , however humiliating , to keep him happy			0
' but as the evidence came out it was plain that this was not quite the position			0
' this was put beyond doubt when you gave evidence			0
you pointed out that you had stood up to him in the past			0
that is why when he asked you for a divorce on no fewer than three occasions you refused him			0
' it is inescapable therefore that when something was important enough to you , you were capable of exercising a choice which was not his choice			0
' instead you joined in with his plan			0
child killers : @entity2 weeps in front of the judge as she is jailed for 17 years as her husband ( left ) and friend @entity2 ( right ) , who was also given 17 years , look on ' the risks were obvious and overwhelming and anyone who has heard the harrowing wailing from you on the 999 call can hear your realisation that this had gone horribly wrong and your children were in mortal danger			1
' you put @entity2 above your children and as a result they have died			1
after the fire you threw your lot in with @entity2			1
you supported him in his quest to get residence of the other children			0
you complied with his sexual demands to keep @entity2 onside			2
' you lied to the police and you stuck to the story , just as he asked you to , to the police and to the jury			0
' you now have convictions for six counts of the manslaughter of your children			0

sisters @entity8 and @entity9 say they *frequently* tried to rescue @entity2
claim she had even attempt suicide in months before tragic fire
but admit she ultimately put her husband before her children
