by @entity0 one of the top contenders for the most @entity3 - like world beyond our solar system is not a real planet but a cosmic masquerade			1
this is according to new research that claims what astronomers believed to be @entity12 was simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star			1
when it was first discovered in 2010 , @entity12 excited astronomers as it looked similar to @entity3 in both size and temperature			1
one of the top contenders for the most @entity3 - like world beyond our solar system is not a real planet , but a cosmic @entity24 is according to new research that claims what astronomers believed to be @entity12 ( artist 's impression pictured ) was simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star it was , they believed , the first planet outside our solar system in the @entity35 around its star – an area not too hot and not too cold for life			1
now , researchers at @entity40 have shown that what was found was n't a planet at all			2
they also claim that another planet in the same solar system , known as @entity45 , announced in 2009 and less hospitable to life , does n't exist			1
@entity40 astronomer @entity47 said that the two planets turned out to be magnetic outbursts from a star			2
@entity51 ( the bright star shown in the centre ) , which is 22 light - years away , has three other confirmed planets , none of which lie within its habitable zone ' this result is exciting because it explains , for the first time , all the previous and somewhat conflicting observations of the intriguing dwarf star @entity51 , ' said dr @entity47			0
@entity51 , which is 22 light - years away , has three other confirmed planets , none of which lie within its habitable zone			0
to find @entity12 , @entity64 , @entity63 astronomers looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star			1
the strength of the tugging , they thought , showed them a planet was about three times as massive as @entity3			1
the discovery of @entity3 - like planets around @entity51 caught the public imagination			0
researchers at @entity40 have shown that what was found , @entity51 581 g , was n't a planet at all			0
they also claim that another planet in the same solar system , known as @entity45 , announced in 2009 and less hospitable to life , does n't exist			1
three outside experts agreed documentary - maker @entity83 and social - networking site @entity82 used a radio telescope in @entity87 to send a powerful focused beam of information - 500 messages from the public in the form of radiowaves - to @entity51			0
and the @entity95 science minister at the time organised 20,000 users of @entity98 to send messages towards the distant solar system in the wake of the discoveries			1
but were doubts at the time of the discovery			0
for instance , @entity107 astronomers cast doubt on the original research claiming they could find no trace of the planet in their own analysis of the same data			0
other exoplanets have previously been doubted , most notably @entity116 , the closest @entity3 - sized world to us which some scientists claim could just be noise in the data			2
dr @entity47 said that the unmasking of @entity45 highlights the need to remain cautious amid the recent rise in exoplanet discoveries			0
a frozen world , similar to @entity3 , that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life			1
the new planet , located 3,000 light years away , is twice as massive as @entity3 and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the @entity3 is from the sun. until the discovery , no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system			1
planets orbiting pairs of binary stars are relatively common			0
' this greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future , ’ said professor @entity148 , from @entity149			0
' half the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems			0
we had no idea if @entity3 - like planets in @entity3 - like orbits could even form in these systems			0
' named @entity160 , the planet ’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. it has been described as the real - life version of ice planet @entity166 featured in @entity167 sequel @entity168 orbits , and is almost certainly a lifeless world			2
but the astronomers point out that the same planet orbiting a sun - like star would be in the ' habitable zone ' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life			1
a frozen world ( right ) , similar to @entity3 , that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life			2
the new planet , located 3,000 light years away , is twice as massive as @entity3			2

astronomers say planet was just magnetic bursts from a local star
@entity12 was thought to be similar to @entity3 in size and temperature
it was believed to be the first planet outside our solar system in the @entity35 around its star – an area not too hot or too cold for life
astronomers also claim that another planet in the same solar system , known as @entity45 , announced in 2009 , does n't exist
