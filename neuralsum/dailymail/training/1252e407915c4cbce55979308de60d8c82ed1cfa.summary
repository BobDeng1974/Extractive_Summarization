it 's 20 years since @entity1 were crowned champions of @entity3			1
a replica @entity5 trophy sits on display at @entity8 and there is a statue to @entity11 , the local millionaire who made it all possible			1
dotted around the club that @entity11 built are memories of those heady days when @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 helped seize the title from @entity19			2
sadly , there is little else left of @entity1 ’s former glory			1
today , they are £ 80million in debt , operating under a transfer embargo and still taking orders from @entity27			1
@entity15 and @entity29 parade the @entity5 trophy after @entity1 won it in 1994 - 95 @entity32 has overseen the slow climb back towards respectability after relegation from @entity5 the fierce opposition to @entity37 ’s has subsided but the mistakes made by the chicken farming family from @entity40 in those first catastrophic years in charge continue to haunt their football club ; the sacking of @entity44 , relegation from the top - flight , boardroom battles and reckless spending			1
@entity1 ’s rookie owners talked about qualifying for the @entity50 and signing @entity51 , but became a laughing stock			1
they have learned a painful lesson and adopt a significantly lower profile these days			2
meanwhile the manager who has overseen the slow climb back towards respectability – though still a million miles from prosperity – seems remarkably laid - back for someone asked to work with at least one hand tied behind his back			2
@entity32 twice stepped in as caretaker after @entity62 and @entity63 were sacked in the tumultuous 2012 - 13 season before getting the job on a permanent basis			1
@entity67 ( left ) and @entity68 , directors of @entity37 's , took control of the club in 2010 ‘ at the time it was nothing short of a mess , ’ says @entity32			1
‘ there were a lot of people who were quick to jump on the bandwagon and call the club at any second			2
‘ we ’re not stupid or naïve , i understand why			2
but i think that ’s credit to the owners			0
they ’ve made progress , educated themselves , learned lessons and improved			0
i think that ’s why they have been out of the papers for 18 months			0
‘ the task was obviously to bring credibility back to the football club which we ’ve done , but there ’s still a long way to go			2
‘ we ’ve stabilised it from where it was			0
but that does n’t mean that it ’s in the place we want it to be			0
now we need to kick on and go again			0
’ the trips to @entity27 to speak to the owners are less frequent these days			0
@entity32 has not been over there for two months			1
but the transfer embargo imposed for breaching @entity105 rules prohibits @entity37 ’s from throwing more money at the problem even if they want to			1
the club were relegated in 2010 - 11 and the supporters were vehemently opposed to @entity37 's it means that he is spending the transfer window fending off bids for his best players instead of signing new ones to get back into the top - flight			1
even if @entity120 meet @entity1 ’s £ 5m valuation of their top scorer @entity122 , it wo n’t knock much of a hole in the £ 79.8m debt			1
the figure is almost twice what @entity37 ’s paid to buy the club in 2010			2
@entity32 has done his bit to steady the ship and only narrowly missed out on the playoffs last season			1
but there ’s a thin line between stability and mediocrity in the eyes of some supporters , and he was booed after the recent defeat to @entity139 as @entity1 continued on a disappointing run that has brought just won win in the last eight @entity142 games			1
‘ we said it would take time and that ’s something the supporters have to be extremely aware of , ’ he said			0
‘ of course the debt makes it more difficult , there ’s no denying that			0
the teams above us are all looking to spend big in this window if you believe the figures and we ca n’t compete with that			0
‘ but that ’s the job			0
i was aware of what was coming , and we just get on with it			0
‘ i ca n’t control other clubs showing interest in our players			0
i just sit there and tick the days off on my calendar in the office and ignore my phone calls ! ’ @entity32 was twice caretaker manager after the sackings of @entity62 and @entity63 in the tumultuous 2012 - 13 season before being appointed permanent manager on saturday , @entity1 can enjoy a rare moment back in the spotlight when they face @entity170 in the lunchtime tie , having held @entity172 to a draw here in the third round last season			1
sadly , according to @entity178 from the club fanzine 4,000 holes , the cup competitions might be @entity1 ’ only opportunity of rubbing shoulders with the elite of @entity3 football from now on			1
‘ the fans ’ previous experience of a takeover was extremely positive with @entity11 , ’ said @entity178			0
‘ for it to go the way it has is even more disappointing			0
‘ but pre- 1985 , we were a @entity193 club until there was a massive injection of cash			2
in terms of the size of the town , you ca n’t say we deserve to be in the top - flight			2
‘ the fans were spoiled a bit and it could n’t last forever			0
some of them wo n’t be too surprised if we never get back up again			0

@entity1 won the @entity5 in the 1994 - 95 season
twenty years on and the club are *struggling* to stay *afloat* in @entity142
@entity1 have debts of almost £ 80m and are under a transfer embargo
@entity32 has led the club to relative stability in *mid-table*
