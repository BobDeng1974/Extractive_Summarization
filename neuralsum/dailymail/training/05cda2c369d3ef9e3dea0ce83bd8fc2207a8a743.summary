by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 @entity4 assistant coach @entity3 became the first person to use a @entity7 application to help his team to victory on sunday night			1
@entity3 took to the dugout at the @entity11 wearing a pair of the innovative glasses which @entity14 have developed alongside the the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) to allow coaches to receive live statistics from the match			1
new era ? @entity3 wears @entity7 during @entity4 's match against @entity21 the view : @entity23 could watch the game while keeping an eye on important match statistics the new technology meant the @entity29 coach could keep up with ' general statistics ' , ' game buliding ' , ' defence ' and ' shots ' all while watching their side cruise to a 2 - 0 win			1
a statement from @entity15 said : ' the product allows the analysis of games in real time and the extraction of data from each game ; clubs will have all the information about their own game , and of the sides they will face throughout the season			0
' it will be the first time that @entity7 integrates such a useful footballing service			0
' in @entity52 , @entity7 could also soon be used by match officials , enabling them to watch action replays as if they were watching the game on the television			1
@entity58 referees could be the first to try out the new technology as referee chief @entity59 discussed last year			0
@entity3 ( centre ) and @entity61 ( right ) have lead @entity29 to the top of @entity63 with five games to go leaders : @entity4 scored twice at the @entity11 to maintain their @entity63 lead you need glasses , ref ! @entity3 ( second left ) will hope @entity63 officials will soon be able to wear @entity7 he told @entity52 newspaper , sued @entity71 : ' basically , we are always open to new technological innovations , but it is also clear that we need to address the fundamental decisions more carefully			1
' [ we should think about ] computer glasses for referees , such as @entity7			2
when we think about technical progress , then we must take the next step to discuss whether the referee could wear glasses to see what everyone sees on the couch			0
' ouch ! @entity85 ( floor ) cut his leg after scoring , but should recover in time for @entity29 's @entity89 clash with @entity90 @entity94 manager and @entity96 columnist @entity93 welcomed the prospect , admitting : ‘ it could be the future and , when my team were 4 - 0 down against @entity100 on saturday , i would n’t have minded a bit of extra technology ! @entity101 : @entity94 boss @entity93 says he would be open to trying a pair of @entity14 glasses ‘ most clubs have analysts in the stands to edit highlights and provide data for coaches and managers			2
you would n’t have imagined that 20 years ago but it is a fantastic learning tool because players can see immediately the points you are making			0
