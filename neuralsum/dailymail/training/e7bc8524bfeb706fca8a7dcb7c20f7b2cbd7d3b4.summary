by @entity0 published : 16:59 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 3 march 2013 yesterday at @entity4 hotel in @entity5 , the professor @entity2 show rolled into town			1
he is still relatively unknown in this country , but surely not for long			0
for prof @entity2 is the @entity11 businessman who is going to bring back the @entity12 ... or at least a modern - day replica of it			1
unveiling his plans for @entity12 , the ebullient mining magnate insisted the new ship will set sail in 2016 , and dismissed his doubters with a single word			1
professor @entity2 thinks that the @entity12 will be up and running as soon as possible , despite the high cost the @entity23 , decorated with intricate woodwork , will provide guests with a relaxing area to socialise during the day ‘ b * * * * * * t , ’ he said to those who questioned whether he would ever make his dream a reality			1
‘ this is not a fantasy , this is not a movie			0
this is going to happen , ’ he added			0
@entity12 will seek to closely match the design of original vessel , which sank on the fifth day of its maiden voyage in april 1912 , killing more than 1,500 passengers and crew			2
it will boast the same interiors , and even the same onboard gymnasium , complete with @entity46 exercise machines			0
the grand staircase , smoking room , @entity49 and various dining rooms will also be recreated , as will the reading and writing room , the swimming pool and @entity56 - influenced @entity52 baths			1
the third class dining room gives an authentic experience of riding on the ship			2
tickets allowing you to experience all three classes will be available the @entity52 baths will be the height of luxury on the £ 400million replica ship there will be an authentic @entity46 gym complete with equipment that guests can use there will not be televisions or state - of - the - art music systems on board , nor internet connections or mobile phones			1
but every passenger will find period costumes in their cabin wardrobe so that they can enjoy ‘ a true 1912 experience ’			0
however , the plans include a safety deck ( with more lifeboats obviously ) , a new high - tech engine , air - conditioning and service lifts			2
as with the original ship , there will be first , @entity88 cabins and passengers will not be allowed to mingle – apart from on the safety deck , where there will be a casino and theatre			0
@entity2 , who made his money in iron ore , is determined to get the project up and running as soon as possible and at 883ft , @entity12 will be three inches longer than its predecessor to accommodate an additional area at the bow where passengers will be able to recreate the iconic ‘ @entity103 pose ’ made famous by actors @entity104 and @entity106 in @entity109 ’s 1997 @entity108 - winning movie			1
@entity109 refused @entity2 ’s invitation to last week ’s @entity12 celebratory gala dinner in @entity112			1
another dinner was held last night at @entity5 ’s @entity114 , where guests were served the same 11 course dinner as @entity118 passengers on the original			0
speaking to @entity121 yesterday , prof @entity2 said he would travel @entity122 on his ship ’s maiden voyage – ‘ although i ’ll probably nip up to @entity118 or the bridge as we come into @entity112 harbour , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity122 has got all the appeal , but there might be people who normally travel @entity122 who might want to go in first			0
’ known as the man who got rich under the radar , @entity2 was born in @entity134 to @entity135 and @entity136 , a silent movie star of the 1920s who went on to set up the first commercial radio stations in @entity11			1
@entity2 made his first millions investing in property on @entity11 ’s @entity141 but became eye - wateringly rich after moving into iron ore mining			2
his net worth is the subject of much debate			0
@entity146 rates @entity2 as @entity11 ’s fifth - richest person with assets of $ 5 billion ( about £ 3.5 billion ) while @entity149 estimates his wealth at a relatively paltry $ 895 million ( £ 600 million )			1
@entity2 contends he is far wealthier than even the @entity146 estimate			2
he refuses to say how much @entity12 will cost to build , although experts believe it will between £ 260 million and £ 400 million			1
while the original was built in @entity155 , this ship will be constructed in a @entity157 yard , and the voyage could become a financial bonanza for @entity2			2
but he says : ‘ my motivation was n’t to make a lot of money but was actually to deliver the ship			0
now something which was n’t primarily aimed in my mind as a great business transaction may well become one			0
’ an example of a berth in the new @entity169 will be able to either spend all six days in one class , or spend two days in each to get the full experience the will be a non-operational radio control room similar to the one that would have sent out the distress call on the original titanic the @entity12 's plans showing how the ship differs from the original			1
there will be more lifeboats and advanced safety equipment on board passengers will be able to buy a six - day ticket for one class , or a mixed ticket covering two days in each section			0
prices have not been set yet although @entity2 says he has already had offers from 16 people of between £ 500,000 and £ 850,000 for berths			1
‘ that ’s not the sort of figure we ’ll be asking but it shows the demand , ’ he says , adding that 40,000 people have expressed an interest on his website @entity196 – an homage to the original titanic operating company , the @entity198			0
‘ the @entity12 is about falling in love with your wife all over again or her falling in love with you			2
it ’s about going back to a different time , ’ he says .			0

professor @entity2 unveiled plans for a @entity12
he is determined that the project will happen despite the *difficulty*
the ship is thought to cost up to £ 400million to build
it will include an antique gymnasium , smoking room , a radio room and three classes of berths
