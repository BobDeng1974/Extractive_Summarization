by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:33 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 17:20 est , 10 september 2013 @entity4 attorney general @entity3 has found herself in hot water after it was revealed that she pushed back the execution of a convicted killer to accommodate her re-election fundraiser , which fell on the same day			1
@entity10 was originally scheduled to die by lethal injection today , but governor @entity12 last month agreed to delay the date to october 1 at the request of the state attorney general			1
on monday , @entity3 went into damage control mode , conceding in a statement that it was wrong to allow her campaign event to take precedent over an execution			1
conflict of interest : attorney general @entity3 ( left ) had to apologize after it was revealed that she had delayed the execution of convicted killer @entity10 ( right ) because it coincided with her fundraiser @entity10 's execution had been scheduled twice before this year but he received a stay amid ongoing questions over his sanity			1
when the latest date change was announced it was not publicly known it was done to accommodate a @entity3 campaign event scheduled for the same night			2
@entity10 was convicted of the march 11 , 1988 , killing of @entity33 , a 30 - year - old exotic dancer whose naked body was found in a rural part of @entity36 , partly covered by a blue tarpaulin			1
@entity10 was also sentenced to die for the slaying in january 1988 of @entity39 , whose body was found a few months later in @entity41 in northern @entity4			1
in addition to the two death sentences , @entity10 was given seven life sentences plus another 110 years in a case involving the attempted murder of a third woman			1
the woman , an exotic dancer , testified during the trial for the @entity33 killing that she was beaten with a rock ; choked , raped and stabbed ; and left near the spot where @entity33 's body was found			2
the woman was attacked two days after @entity33 disappeared			0
@entity33 had been stabbed and strangled			0
loved ones of @entity10 ’s victims were upset to learn of the reason for the delay in his execution			1
' what 's going on down there ? it 's ridiculous , ' @entity33 's mother , @entity63 , told the @entity65			0
speaking to the station @entity67 tuesday , the 86 - year - old @entity69 woman who had waited 25 years to see her daughter 's killer executed called this latest delay a ' shame			2
' kept in the dark : @entity4 gov. @entity12 granted @entity3 's request to push back the execution , but said he did not know that the reason was because it conflicted with her fundraiser ' i just think what 's been going on has been just terrible for us , ' @entity78 said			1
' it was just awful for everybody			0
' the @entity85 governor said he changed the date at @entity3 's request , but he acknowledged on monday that he did not know that the reason was because it conflicted with the fundraiser scheduled in @entity89			2
@entity12 , who would not say if he would have delayed the execution if he knew about the event , said it 's routine for the governor 's office to work in tandem with the statewide elected officials who make up the @entity4 @entity97			2
' when another cabinet member asks for something , we try to work with them , ’ @entity12 said			2
hours after @entity12 answered questions about the execution delay @entity3 issued a statement that said she should have not have made the request			1
‘ as a prosecutor , there was nothing more important than seeing justice done , especially when it came to the unconscionable act of murder , ’ @entity3 said			2
‘ i personally put two people on death row and , as attorney general , have already participated in eight executions since i took office , a role i take very seriously			1
‘ the planned execution of @entity10 had already been stayed twice by the courts , and we should not have requested that the date of the execution be moved , ’ she said			2
@entity78 , however , said she had no use in @entity3 's apology at this point , adding that she has nothing to say to the attorney general			1
@entity3 worked for the @entity129 state attorney before she ran for attorney general in 2010			1
this summer she opened her campaign account for a second term			0
so far she has no declared opposition			0
ironic : @entity3 ( center ) , a @entity85 , had been a strong supporter of the state 's @entity135 - a new state law which speeds up executions by limiting ' frivolous ' inmate appeals the attorney general plays a pivotal role in executions			1
it represents the state in death row appeals cases			2
usually the attorney general remains available on the date of the executions in case of any last - minute legal issues			1
@entity3 's office said that is why she sought a delay in @entity10 's execution			1
‘ in light of the seriousness of any execution , it was very important to attorney general @entity3 that she be available personally to carry out her office 's duties in the execution process , ’ said @entity156 , a spokeswoman for @entity3			1
@entity3 's decision to seek a delay in the execution date because it conflicted with a fundraiser was first reported by @entity169 of @entity4			1
@entity10 's attorneys have argued before that he is mentally ill. one previous lawyer claimed @entity10 was ‘ mentally deranged ’ and not responsible for his actions			0
but several judges concluded he was using a claim of mental illness to manipulate the judicial process			0
@entity10 's execution was first scheduled in june but he received a stay two hours before he was supposed to receive a lethal injection			2
he then received a second stay of execution a day before his july execution date			0
the @entity4 @entity182 in august ruled that @entity10 was sane enough to be executed			0
death row : he was supposed to die by lethal injection in the death chamber at @entity186 , pictured , but a court of appeals granted him a temporary stay as his lawyers said he is insane @entity3 , a @entity85 , had been a strong supporter of the state 's @entity135 - a new state law which speeds up executions by limiting ' frivolous ' inmate appeals the delay keeps @entity10 on death row an extra 21 days to the tune of about $ 1,000 , according to the @entity200 ’ estimates			1
@entity10 's attorneys have argued that he is mentally ill. during his trials , he had frequent verbal outbursts , laughed out loud and even howled			0
he has also contended that the previous date of his execution , june 24 , 2013 , adds up to 666 and that he is a target of ' @entity206 who have threatened that date by mail for years '			0
but @entity10 has no significant history of mental illness and last month a panel of psychiatrists found that he was mentally sound			0
they said that @entity10 claimed that the ' @entity214 ' wanted him dead to sell his organs - a story they say he made up to manipulate the judicial process			0
@entity10 first kidnapped a stripper named @entity219 in march 1988 , raped her , slit her throat and hit her across the head with a rock before leaving her to die in a rural area			1
but she survived and managed to alert police			0
@entity10 had also stolen her car - and her two - year - old son in the back seat			0

upon questioning about all three crimes and shown pictures of @entity33 's body , police said his eyes filled with tears and he said : ' if i did this , i deserve the death penalty			0
' @entity10 initially denied knowing any of the women , according to police			2
but he later testified that all three women worked for him at his escort service			1
