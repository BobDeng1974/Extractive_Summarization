fake tan has come a long way since the days of streaky orange ankles and hard - to - use lotions that delivered an artificial pumpkin hue			1
nowadays an abundance of sophisticated products promise smooth , fast , fuss - free application and achieve an extremely realistic result			1
such advances have also attracted a more discerning and stylish customer – step forward @entity11 , the face of leading brand @entity14 ’s new range , for which she appeared nude in a series of upmarket publicity shots			0
as she says : ‘ @entity14 does it so well that you do look natural			0
you do n’t have that fear , which i always did , of going streaky			0
’ but there has been growing disquiet in the scientific community about the safety of so - called fake bakes – specifically about their key ingredient : @entity29			1
it is this chemical , dihydroxyacetone , that reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce the brown ‘ suntan ’ colour			2
it is also this compound that gives fake bakes their characteristic – often described as biscuity – smell			1
flawless : @entity11 as the face and body of spray - tan brand @entity14 last year , a panel of @entity48 medical experts reviewed scientific studies on @entity29 for @entity50			1
they reported that tests on live animal cells had shown the chemical could cause dna damage , which is linked to cancer , and toxicologists voiced their concerns about the possible risk			1
dr @entity60 , director general of the @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , admits that such concerns are leading companies to lower concentrations of @entity29			1
and many new products claim to be completely free of the chemical			1
but with a third of @entity70 women and one in ten men using these products in an industry worth £ 100 million a year , the question remains : is @entity29 safe or not ? rise of the booths the cosmetic use of @entity29 in tanning creams and gels was first approved by the @entity78 – still the best international benchmark of safety and quality – in the 1970s			1
since then , however , sunless tanning techniques have changed almost out of recognition			0
while mousses , lotions and creams are just smeared on to the skin , the spray methods now in common use apply the concoction through the use of an aerosol			0
spray - on tan : the cosmetic use of @entity29 in tanning creams and gels was first approved by the @entity78 in the 1970s ( file picture ) there are three main types of spray tan			1
the simplest is the manual turbine spray , an ‘ airbrush ’ held by the beautician			0
the second , known as a third - generation spray booth , consists of a closed compartment – similar to a shower cubical – in which , after a short countdown , three rows of nozzles spray a product on to the entire body			2
turning around is not necessary as the whole body is enveloped in fine mist			0
the fourth - generation spray booth , in contrast , is open and contains two vertical rows of nozzles			2
the customer stands and turns around to allow the other side of the body to be sprayed			0
these techniques give a faster , more even result – but they also increase the risk of absorbing @entity29 through inhalation and by contact with mucous membranes in the eyes and mouth			1
it is this absorption that may be dangerous			0
at the time of last year ’s study , dr @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 at @entity132 , said : ‘ the substance seems to have a potential for what they call creating mutations , or changing dna in living cells , which is a serious problem and needs to be further investigated , yet has n’t been			0
’ although this is based only on lab tests on individual animal and bacterial cells , rather than observations in humans , she warned : ‘ what we ’re concerned about is not so much the reaction that creates the tanning , but reactions that may occur deeper down with living cells – which might then change dna , causing a mutation – and what the possible impacts of that might be			0
i ’d be very concerned of the potential for lung cancer			2
’ dr @entity161 , a toxicologist and lung specialist at the @entity163 , also urged caution , saying : ‘ the lungs have a huge surface area and these compounds could get into the bloodstream and promote the development of cancers			0
‘ [ regular inhalation ] could potentially lead to cancer or the worsening of asthma or other lung disease			2
’ the risk would be most significant for those visiting salons frequently or for staff who spray the tan on to customers			0
fake tan : products have moved on since the days of streaky orange ankles @entity184 dr @entity185 , a consultant dermatologist in the @entity70 , believes the chemical to be safe – though he advises against inhaling it – and points out that his opinion is shared by most scientists			1
‘ organisations such as the @entity192 and the @entity194 state quite clearly that it is a safer method of acquiring a tan than intentional sunbathing or the use of tanning beds , ’ says dr @entity185			0
‘ there is no direct evidence @entity29 increases the risk of cancer but there is evidence that sunbathing does			1
’ when faking it , take precautions while the @entity78 has approved @entity29 in traditional self - tanning creams and lotions , it states unequivocally that its use as a spray has not been approved , due to a lack of data			1
the @entity78 recommends people protect their eyes , mouth and nose and do not inhale the spray			0
these recommendations echo a report in 2010 from the @entity222 , which advised using nose filters and eye protection in fourth - generation booths			2
safer option : the @entity192 and the @entity194 have said fake tan is safer than sunbathing yet when @entity228 contacted six leading @entity70 tanning salons , all providing @entity29 - based spray tans from leading brands such as @entity14 and @entity232 , not one recommended or even provided any form of protection from inhalation or absorption			1
indeed , the idea was discouraged because , as one beautician said , it would ‘ leave you with an outline ’			0
@entity241 is best , but follow instructions ‘ it ’s important to follow instructions on the packet and the most important thing for spray - tan is to use the product in a well ventilated place , ’ says dr @entity60			2
‘ we ’ve heard that people have been wheezing and coughing , but that happens with any aerosol product and we suspect that a few people have used too much in a small room			0
some people apply it in the shower , where there is no fresh air , and that is not a good idea as it could make you cough and sneeze			0
’ the cocktail effect so just how safe is your fake bake ? well , experts seem to agree that @entity29 is not harmful unless it gets inside the body			1
so as long as you take precautions and do n’t plan on eating your fake bake instead of putting it on your skin , it need n’t be a problem			2
there are some dissenting voices			0
@entity280 , director of chem trust , a @entity70 organisation that investigates the safety of man - made chemicals , argues there could be a ‘ cocktail effect ’			1
while ingredients may be well tested on their own , daily life exposes us to a huge variety of chemicals at once , with potentially unforeseen consequences			0
these concerns , however , have been widely dismissed as scare - mongering			1
dr @entity295 , @entity296 at the @entity62 , says : ‘ @entity29 has recently been reviewed by the @entity298 ’s independent scientific committee , which oversees the safety of cosmetic ingredients and confirmed it is safe in cosmetic products			1
’ nonetheless , devotees of spray tan booths might want to think carefully – or even , if you dare , abandon the fake tan altogether and embrace the pale and interesting look .			2

there has been a growing disquiet about the safety of ' fake - bakes '
key ingredient @entity29 is thought to cause @entity316 damage , linked to cancer
such concerns have led companies to lower @entity29 concentrations
many new products claim to be completely free of the chemical
