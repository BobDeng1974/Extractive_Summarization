by @entity0 @entity1 wrote a letter to the prime minister when she heard funding to the @entity5 football team had been cut a young girl who penned a letter to the prime minister of australia when she discovered funding to her favourite sport had been slashed , has hit back at @entity12 's response saying he did n't answer her questions			1
@entity1 , who is just 12 years old , was outraged when she heard that @entity15 's @entity5 football team had their $ 175,000 @entity17 funding reduced to nothing			1
a footballer herself , @entity1 is vision impaired and expressed her disappointment with the @entity23 in a letter to mr @entity12 , the @entity26 report			1
the @entity23 is responsible for distributing the funds which are allocated to @entity5 sports , and this year the @entity29 missed out completely			0
currently ranked 12th in the world , the @entity29 have n't made an appearance at the @entity32 since 2000 , and the team 's low rank was apparently one of the big reasons funding was pulled			2
the team was formed by the @entity39 and the @entity40 back in 1998			0
in her letter , @entity1 told the prime minister she was upset because she looked up to the team as role models and her sport was n't all about winning medals			2
' what hope is there for us kids ? what do we have to aim for ? how is that promoting encouragement , respect or inclusion ? ' she wrote			0
the vision impaired footballer was not happy with mr @entity12 's response and said he did n't answer her questions she received a letter back from mr @entity12 , but was not impressed with the stock - standard response he sent her			1
his letter opened with ' one of the most enjoyable things about being prime minister is hearing from young people like yourself			2
' ' it says something positive about you that you were willing to take the time to write and share with me your thoughts about the issues that face our country , ' it continued			0
but for @entity1 , who also wrote to the sports minister @entity80 and opposition leader @entity81 , described mr @entity12 's response as rude			1
the @entity29 are currently ranked 12th in the world but have n't competed at the @entity32 since 2000 ' is n’t democracy supposed to be about equality and social justice and being able to have a say about things that important to you ? the pm could n’t even be bothered to answer any of my questions , ' she told the publication			2
@entity1 's mother @entity94 said she does n't think the @entity95 know who they 're up against and her daughter will not be easily deterred from pursuing something she is passionate about			0
' there is no grey in @entity1 ’s world and certainly not when it comes to issues of equality			0
' when the funding announcement was made , @entity29 coach @entity105 launched an online campaign to restore funding and is apparently in talks with the @entity40 to devise a solution			0
@entity1 said she was not impressed with the prime minister 's response and has also written to the sports minister and @entity81			1

@entity1 wrote to the prime minister when she discovered funding to the @entity29 had been cut
the 12 - year - old is vision impaired and football is one of her passions
she was not *satisfied* with mr @entity12 's response and said he did n't answer her questions
@entity29 *previously* *granted* $ 175,000 but this year received no money
