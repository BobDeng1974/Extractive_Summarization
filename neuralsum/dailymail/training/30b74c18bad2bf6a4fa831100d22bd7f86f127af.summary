wrong message : a surfer has complained about @entity1 's sexy advert focus : the ad features champion surfer @entity25 , but critics complained that the viewer never sees her face , or surfing skills ' surfing should be a place where women can show they 're strong and powerful			1
ads like @entity1 's ads prove women are still navigating gender bias that reinforces harmful stereotypes , ' she told the @entity39			1
@entity4 said she was incensed by the advert , featuring seductive shots of @entity43 surfer @entity25 's body , but without showing her face , or her riding any waves			1
the ad was created to promote the @entity47 contest sponsored by the clothing line this summer			0
' this tells young girls it 's more important to be sexy than to be strong or a good surfer , ' @entity4 said , according to news.com.au			2
the lifelong surfer has always competed without sponsorship so she can easily speak out on issues important to her , such as gender inequality			0

' you only showed one dimension of women ( how they look ) so therefore you have ignored who we truly are			0
there should be surfing in the ad , cause in case you forgot , you ’re running a surfing contest soon ! ' another commenter posted			2
skills : in the first @entity1 advert , above , @entity25 is only seen paddling through the waves , but in a later advert , below , the company finally shows her face , and ability a statement from the company said : ' we believe all athletes are naturally beautiful , in and out of the water			1
you certainly do n’t have to be sexy to be an athlete , we also believe it ’s not wrong to be an athlete and to be sexy , if you choose to be			0
' it added : ' we do n’t judge one to be better than the other			0
we do n’t believe in excluding one for the other			0
