@entity1 shareholder @entity0 has made a move to oust directors @entity3 and @entity5 from the @entity7 board			1
@entity0 , the owner of @entity8 , upped his stake in the @entity11 club six days ago , increasing his stake in the @entity14 giants to 8.9 per cent			1
now the @entity16 owner - widely rumoured to be plotting a push for more control - has called for an emergency general meeting			1
@entity0 has increased his stake in @entity1 to 8.92 per cent the @entity14 club the current @entity1 board have said they will fight to save @entity3 and @entity5 's positions in a statement to the @entity26 statement , saying : ' the company announces that it has received a notice from @entity0			1
' the notice states that @entity29 holds 4,265,000 ordinary shares of 1p each in the @entity32 amounting to five per cent of the voting rights of the @entity32			2
' mash requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company			2
' the notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of @entity3 and @entity5 as directors of the company			0
the company is currently verifying that the notice is properly constituted			0
' if valid , the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company 's forthcoming annual generl meeting , further details of which will be announced in due course			2
' the board is united in its support of the executive team			0
if the notice is valid and is not withdrawn , the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions			0
a further announcement will be made shortly			0
' @entity3 , the club 's chief executive , has recently held a series of meetings with @entity69 and @entity70 , allies of former director @entity72			2
@entity1 shareholder @entity0 has made a move to oust directors @entity3 ( centre ) and @entity5 @entity72 has offered to invest up to £ 30m in the club in the past and is now investigating ways to grab control without rewarding the current directors he blames for the club 's malaise			1
a new share issue has been a stated aim of the board as it seeks to raise funds before another cash shortfall arrives at the end of the year			0
that could allow @entity72 to make a substantial investment and seize control , but any such move would obviously weaken the existing powerbase at the club			0
@entity0 already has strong commercial interests at @entity1 through retail contracts with @entity16			1
he also owns , but is yet to activate , the naming rights to @entity7 – reportedly purchased for £ 1 from former chief executive @entity99			0
@entity0 ’s latest move raises questions as to whether he wants to prevent the board agreeing a deal with @entity72 and instead steer them down a different financing route			1
@entity3 and @entity5 are viewed as being in favour of the option provided by @entity108 - based businessman			0
@entity0 is currently limited to a @entity1 stake of under 10 per cent through an agreement with the @entity111 , as part of their rules on dual ownership , but it is thought he held unsuccessful talks with the club about a loan prior to last month ’s stop - gap share offer that raised £ 3.13 million			1
@entity1 currently sit second in the @entity11 , six points behind @entity122 @entity0 did not invest in that process but instead waited to increase his stake by buying shares from fund managers @entity127 - a move which meant his money did not go towards aiding the perilous financial position at @entity7			1
the sportswear tycoon will need the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders if his bid to remove @entity3 and @entity5 is to be successful			0
@entity135 , chairman of the football board at @entity1 , has yet to make any comment about the @entity140 request but has previously publically stated his support for further involvement by @entity0 at @entity7			1
@entity143 currently holds voting rights over a shareholding block of around 26 per cent			0
should that group all be in favour of axing @entity3 and @entity5 then it would still leave @entity0 seeking another 15 per cent			1
@entity148 are the club ’s largest single largest shareholder with just over 16 per cent and have their own representative on the board in @entity153			2
the @entity26 statement insisted the board was ‘ united ’ in backing @entity3 and @entity5			0
however , with various other shareholder factions now assessing their options , @entity0 has fired the first shot in a battle that could prove pivotal to the future direction of @entity1 .			2

@entity0 , the owner of @entity8 , upped his stake in the @entity11 club to 8.9 per cent last week
now the @entity16 owner has called for an emergency meeting
*rangers* are second in the championship , six points behind @entity122
