by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:22 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 14 february 2013 @entity3 @entity2 blocked the confirmation of former senator @entity5 to be secretary of defense , making it the first time that such a nominee has been temporarily barred from their intended post			1
though @entity2 was approved on tuesday as a suitable nominee by the @entity12 , @entity10 voted against his nomination			2
in order to be approved as secretary of defense - to take over from outgoing secretary @entity17 - he needed to get 60 votes in the @entity20 - heavy caucus			1
he only garnered 58 , with 40 votes against			2
conservatives cite their longstanding objections to their former colleague 's policy views on @entity26 and @entity27 in their debates , but really they blame the @entity31 administration 's reticence to reveal more information about the attacks on the @entity35 consulate in @entity36 in which four were killed , including @entity35 ambassador @entity37			1
weary : though he is a @entity2 , @entity5 took a beating in @entity12 hearings for his views that the @entity35 should engage in direct talks with @entity27 and @entity26 ' there are still questions outstanding , ' senator @entity43 said on the floor thursday			1
@entity43 was one of the @entity2 , along with senator @entity47 , who led the charge against @entity2 's approval			2
@entity2 , a former two term @entity2 senator , was nominated by president @entity31 on january 7 to replace @entity17			1
though once a member of their ranks , @entity2 in the @entity3 have fiercely criticized the @entity54 native for his views that the @entity35 should engage in direct talks with @entity27 and @entity55			1
now his vote is being held up using the organizational wrangling of a filibuster , though the changes will not hold			0
in a purely logistical move , @entity61 senate majority leader @entity60 voted against @entity2 so that he is able to bring up the vote on his confirmation at a later date			2
happy with the result : @entity2 senators @entity43 and @entity68 did not want @entity2 to be approved and they were some of the most critical questioners during his confirmation hearing @entity72 : @entity3 republicans @entity47 ( @entity74 ) , left , and @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , right , have threatened to delay the full @entity3 confirmation vote on @entity2 , scheduled for friday ' @entity5 had nothing to do with the attack on @entity80			1
there are serious consequences to this delay , ' @entity60 said in response on thursday			0
with the vote where it was , @entity2 would have been passed a majority measure , but he needed 60 votes in order to comply with the regulations			1
when his appointment is brought up again - which will likely take place next week - he will only need a majority in order to be approved			2
he was also forced to apologize for his statement in a 2006 interview in which he said , ' the @entity98 lobby intimidates a lot of people up here …			0
i ’m not an @entity26 senator			0
i ’m a @entity35 senator			2
' additionally , @entity2 have expressed deep concerns about @entity2 's earnings once he retired from the @entity3 in 2008 and moved into the private sector			1
they have asked for details of his compensation as a consultant and his time on the lecture circuit , to prove that he did n't take money from countries hostile to @entity35			0
tough crowd : the @entity3 confirmation hearing to review @entity31 's nomination of @entity5 kicked off on jan. 31 and was met with opposition from @entity2 the @entity12 hearings on @entity2 's nomination kicked off on january 31 , starting an ugly , partisan back and forth			1
despite opposition from conservatives , the committee approved @entity2 as their nominee on february 12			2
now the decision goes to the @entity3 floor for a vote			0
senator @entity60 filed a motion on wednesday to limit debate and force a vote by the end of the week but @entity2 are saying , ' not so fast			2
' though @entity2 are in the minority in the upper chamber , 45 to 55 @entity61 members , they are aggressively working to form a 60 - vote margin that would filibuster the vote			2
though this maneuver is a filibuster by definition , republicans are avoiding the label			0
' we 're going to require a 60 - vote threshold , ' @entity2 senator @entity75 , the ranking member of the @entity12 , told @entity148 blog , @entity149			1
' it 's not a filibuster			0
i do n't want to use that word , ' he said			0
plotting ahead : @entity61 senate majority leader @entity60 voted against @entity2 purely for logistics so that he is allowed to call another vote for the prospective nominee later on , which will likely take place next week @entity75 also told the @entity159 this week that he would work to foil mr @entity31 's plans			1
' it 's going to be a long , long time before he hits the floor , ' he said about trying to delay a @entity3 vote on @entity2			1
' the anti-israel history of @entity5 is real			0
we ca n’t have someone at the @entity167 who has made these kind of statements , ' @entity75 added			0
several others in the party are also said to have joined @entity75 's cause			0
@entity2 senator @entity47 from @entity74 - who is also a member of the @entity12 - said earlier this month that mr @entity31 should reconsider @entity2 's nomination			1
@entity47 is among the republicans who voted against ending debate on @entity2 's nomination			0
he has joined with fellow committee members @entity43 and senator @entity68 to call on mr @entity31 to clarify his administration 's precise actions in the hours leading up to the september 11 attack on the @entity182 in @entity183			1
outta here : defense secretary @entity17 , on feb. 13 , left the @entity185 to head up the @entity167 in july 2011 ' the debate on @entity5 is not over , ' @entity47 said			1
' it has not been serious			0
we do n't have the information we need			0
and i 'm going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers about what the president did personally when it came to the @entity183 debacle			0
' this week @entity43 slammed @entity2 for his ' disappointing ' performance answering questions , adding ' his often adversarial attitude toward legitimate questions from @entity12 members was troubling			0
' committee chair @entity61 senator @entity203 has expressed his confidence in the @entity31 administration 's desire to be forthcoming on the @entity183 attack			1
other democrats have praised @entity2 for his military service during the @entity210 , for which he earned two purple hearts , and his @entity213 career .			0

senator @entity5 was nominated by president @entity31 to take over as secretary of defense after @entity17 steps down
needs to be approved by the @entity3 in order to take the post
@entity2 in @entity3 are still angry about the handling of the attack on the @entity35 consulate in @entity36 and demand answers from @entity31 team
@entity2 needed 60 votes to be approved , lost with only 58 for and 40 against
