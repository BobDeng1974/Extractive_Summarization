television presenter @entity0 has called the police over diet pill adverts which use her before and after weight - loss images without her permission to promote the product			1
the @entity7 star , 55 , has alerted police to the advertisements for raspberry ketone pills and tea , which feature photographs of her and fraudulently claim she used the products to lose weight			1
it is claimed raspberry ketone capsules and herbal tea are used to quicken the metabolism , which results in weight loss			1
@entity7 television presenter @entity0 , 55 , revealed she has called the police over diet pill adverts which are using her before and after weight - loss images ( above ) without her permission to promote the product the 55 - year - old took to her @entity28 page today to confirm she had informed the police of the advertisements the mother of one took to her @entity28 page today to warn fans that she did not give her permission for the weight - loss photographs to be used , nor did she endorse the products			1
the morning television presenter told her 504,000 followers : ' i 'm extremely angry that a bogus company is using my image to promote their weight loss " ketone " tea			1
it 's being going on for months			0
' i 've informed the police			2
please do not fall for this ! i lost weight by eating sensibly and doing 2 classes a week with @ @entity51			1
' her spokesman added : ‘ @entity0 is extremely angry that her name and image are being used in this way and that women are being duped into spending their money			1
' she believes the only way to lose weight and keep it off is through exercise and eating healthily			1
’ it is believed the adverts have been generated by a bogus company to dupe people into parting with their credit card details			2
it is believed that the customers do not receive the pills once they have paid the money for the bogus product			2
they first appeared in june last year and @entity0 threatened to take legal action in january when they continued to appear online			0
it was unclear tonight which police force in the country the television presenter reported the issue to			2
it is also unclear which company is behind the adverts			0
however , @entity83 , a partner specialising in media law at @entity85 , said he could understand why the television presenter had gone to police , if the advertisements were being produced by a bogus company			2
mr @entity83 said : ‘ if it is the case that it is a bogus company that is responsible for these advertisements , and some form of fraud has been committed , then one can understand why miss @entity0 has gone to the criminal authorities to seek to put a stop to these harmful activities			0
’ he said that if the company was a legitimate trading firm then it could still face civil and criminal proceedings under @entity100 law			0
he said : ‘ on a civil side , the fact they have used her name to suggest she has endorsed their product - her name , image and reputation - that constitutes false endorsement and passing off which would entitle her to bring proceedings , to stop them using her name and image in this way , and for damages			2
‘ if @entity0 has a registered trademark in her name , then it is possible that a criminal offence may have been committed under the @entity121 , and if that is the case there are criminal penalties for unauthorised use of trademark under the act			0
' the television star said she was ' extremely angry ' about the adverts and said she lost weight by eating well television presenter @entity131 has previously been forced to deny using diet pills after being linked to a scam advertising campaign for a weight - loss supplement			1
she lost weight through gastric band surgery the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , which is responsible for making sure @entity139 adverts are responsible and not misleading , said using a person 's image in an advert without their permission was ' likely to be a problem under the advertising code '			1
regulations imposed by the @entity137 warn that companies using endorsements in advertising must ' hold documentary evidence that a testimonial or endorsement used in a marketing communication is genuine ’			0
with @entity0 denying any involvement with ketone products , it appears the advertisements using her photographs have breached the code			0
however , an @entity137 spokesman said that the issue ' appears to go beyond our role and remit			0
' the spokesman said : ' we ’re aware of several bogus operators , often based abroad and outside our jurisdiction , who peddle @entity170 products			0
' we regulate the advertising of legitimate @entity139 companies , we ’re not a statutory or law enforcement body			0
' in this instance , it looks like a legal issue surrounding image rights / copyright and a problem best tackled through appropriate legal channels			0
' the tv personality was also caught up in a similar situation last year when several companies selling raspberry ketone tablets stated that she , along with the @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , had used their product to lose weight			1
the companies all issued their adverts through @entity192			0
images of the @entity185 , @entity185 , have been used by the so - called @entity195 diet @entity187 ( left ) and @entity186 ( right ) have both previously had images used in scam advert at the time , the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) said that the adverts were misleading and upheld complaints which had been made			1
the adverts were subsequently banned from appearing on the internet			0
television presenter @entity131 was also forced to deny using diet pills after being linked to a scam advertising campaign for a weight - loss supplement			1
the 56 - year - old rubbished the claims via @entity28 saying she had never used raspberry ketone capsules , and warned : it 's a scam ! not me ! ' the adverts featuring the tv star included the words : ' @entity213 proves critics wrong			1
drops 22st without cheating – no weird exercise or ugly diets ! ' it also featured a photograph of her face , despite the @entity222 presenter having not given her consent to be linked with the product			2
