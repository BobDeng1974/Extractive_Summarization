by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 20 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:03 est , 20 november 2013 a glowing lagoon off @entity5 's northeastern coast has gone almost completely dark and biologists have no idea why			1
the @entity8 in @entity9 usually glows when bioluminescent organisms that live in the water are disturbed , yet they have not been visible for at least nine days			1
nearby construction work is thought to have caused disruption to the area , but biologists also believe a recent spate of bad weather could have caused the glowing lagoon to dull			1
the @entity8 , pictured , usually glows when bioluminescent organisms are disturbed , but has been dark for at least nine days			1
scientists are unsure why but theories suggest nearby construction work may have disrupted water in the lagoon			1
it went dark in 2003 before glowing again a few months later the bioluminescent lagoon is often referred to as a bay and is a popular tourist attraction			2
visitors row kayaks or take boat trips from the nearby city of @entity33 in @entity9 to watch the water glow			1
the lagoon is filled with one - celled organisms said to be half - animal and half - plant called dinoflagellates that glow like fireflies when the water is disturbed			1
these organisms are bioluminescent thanks to an enzyme called luciferase			0
the name comes from @entity46 and is @entity47 for lucem ferrem , which means ' light - bearer '			0
bioluminescent organisms can regulate how much light they produce by using different lucieferases in a range of ways			0
in the @entity33 lagoon , a greenish - blue light swirls off hands and arms as visitors trail them through the water and the glow increases when boats are sailed through it			1
another theory is the chopping down of mangrove trees in the area , to let larger boats into the lagoon and its surrounding water , could also have played a part			2
' we have been compiling data , ' @entity71 , secretary of the @entity72 said			0
' there are a lot of factors that could be at play			0
' the bioluminescent lagoon is often referred to as a bay and is a popular tourist attraction			0
visitors row kayaks or take boat trips from the nearby city of @entity33 to watch the water glow			1
the lagoon is filled with one - celled organisms said to be half - animal and half - plant that glow like fireflies if the water is disturbed			1
a greenish light swirls off hands and arms as visitors trail them through the water			0
however , the bioluminescence has dropped so significantly , tour operators have had to cancel trips and reimburse visitors , @entity98 added			0
@entity33 mayor @entity103 blamed surface runoff caused by nearby construction of a water and sewer treatment plant			1
he has since asked that the plant be moved elsewhere , yet officials involved with the plant deny the work is causing the lagoon 's problems and the government @entity115 added the treatment plant has adequate erosion and sediment controls that ' comply with environmental standards			2
' there are three lagoons in @entity5 that glow like the one in @entity33 and are referred to as ' bio bays			2
' each lagoon is filled with organisms called dinoflagellates that glow like fireflies when the water is disturbed			1
these cause a greenish - blue light to appear when boats sail through it recent rains and a storm that are generating heavy waves is another possibility for affecting the lagoon 's bioluminescence ( pictured here , before the blackout ) as a preventive measure , the government has temporarily suspended construction at the project for two weeks until scientists can figure out what is causing the problem			2
@entity146 , president of the state @entity148 and @entity149 , said he will evaluate scientists ' findings before deciding how to proceed in several weeks			0
recent rains and a storm that are generating heavy waves is another possibility for affecting the lagoon 's bioluminescence , continued @entity98			2
the @entity157 , which manages the lagoon and surrounding areas , collects water samples three times a week to record data including temperature , salinity and precipitation			0
scientists will analyse this data to help solve the mystery of the darkening lagoon			0
it is not the first time the lagoon has gone dark			0
it went nearly dark for a couple of months in 2003 but the glow was restored before scientists could establish the exact cause .			0

@entity33 lagoon usually glows when organisms in the water are disturbed
for the past nine days the water in the lagoon has remained dark
biologists do *n't* know why it 's stopped glowing and are *investigating*
nearby construction work , or bad weather could be to blame
