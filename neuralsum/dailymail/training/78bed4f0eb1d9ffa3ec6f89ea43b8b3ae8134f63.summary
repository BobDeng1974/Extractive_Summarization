@entity0 walked free from court yesterday , with legal experts predicting he wo n’t spend a day behind bars			0
the sprinter was found guilty of culpable homicide in the shooting death of girlfriend @entity7 , but @entity9 legal academics say a jail sentence is unlikely , and a @entity12 official confirmed he would be allowed to resume his lucrative career			1
double - amputee @entity0 , 27 , left the @entity15 as a convicted killer – although crucially not a murderer – and must wait until october 13 for sentencing			1
culpable homicide , or manslaughter as it is known in @entity21 , carries a maximum sentence of 15 years , but no minimum			1
judge @entity24 is a keen advocate of leniency towards first - time offenders			1
’ legal academic @entity34 added : ‘ it could even be the imposition of a fine or community service , or house arrest			1
’ miss @entity7 ’s mother , june , 67 , said the family was ‘ shocked and disappointed ’ by the verdict			1
‘ it does n’t add up , ’ she said			1
‘ this verdict is not justice for @entity7			1
i just want the truth			0
i ca n’t believe that they believe it was an accident			0
‘ she died a horrible death			2
a horrible , painful , terrible death			0
they believe his story , and i do n’t believe that story – that ’s the difference			2
’ her husband @entity53 , 71 , who suffered a stroke after @entity7 ’s death , said : ‘ i was terrified i would n’t make it			1
’ he added : ‘ all we wanted was the truth			2
now he must suffer the consequences			0
i do n’t think he ever said sorry			0
you hold your child as a baby in your arms and you say , “ i promise no harm will ever come to you ”			0
and you feel guilty that you never kept your word			2
’ as @entity0 stood to hear the judge clear him of murdering @entity68 , 29 , in february last year but find him guilty of manslaughter , he betrayed none of the emotion he had shown to the court during his six - month trial			1
the double - amputee , 27 , left court as a convicted killer – although crucially not a murderer – and must wait untl october 13 for sentencing loud sobs could be heard , however , only feet away as the dead model ’s friend @entity80 shook her head and wept			1
@entity83 slapped his leg and grimaced , occasionally snatching a glance at the man who had taken his daughter ’s life			2
the @entity7 family were desperately hoping their daughter ’s killer would be jailed for the maximum life sentence			1
during the lengthy court case , they heard that she had written a hauntingly prophetic note a few weeks before she was killed			0
after @entity0 and @entity68 left a party on bad terms , she texted him to say : ‘ i ’m scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you will react to me			2
’ such testy exchanges were common between the pair after they started dating in december 2012 , less than three months before miss @entity7 ’s violent death			1
victim : @entity0 's girlfriend @entity7 the arguments mainly stemmed from the athlete ’s insecurity and jealously , and his love of firearms			1
in truth , there are many dark secrets in the life of @entity0 , a man with a volcanic temper and a near - pathological obsession with weapons			2
there are many in @entity9 – and throughout the world – who believe @entity0 still refuses to take responsibility for @entity68 ’s violent death			2
and that yesterday ’s verdict has allowed him to escape justice			1
after the verdicts , @entity125 , the patriarch of the large @entity0 family , expressed his ‘ deep gratitude ’ to the judge for acquitting the sprinter of murder , adding , ‘ there are no victors in this ’			1
he spoke of the ‘ big burden that is now off our shoulders ’			2
prosecutors expressed their disappointment at the court ’s findings , but said they would wait until after the runner ’s sentencing hearing before deciding whether to launch an appeal			1
in a failed application to have the athlete ’s bail revoked , prosecutor @entity148 – apparently stung by judge @entity24 ’s comments that he failed to make the case for murder – presumed ‘ a lengthy sentence ’ for @entity0 , citing a recent nightclub scuffle , the fact that he was ‘ a flight risk ’ and the double amputee ’s suicidal feelings as compelling reasons to remand him in custody			1
even if he is jailed , @entity0 could still be in his early 30s when he is free to pick up the pieces of his once - glittering career			2
and the @entity163 yesterday indicated it was an achievable goal			0
in an interview that was seen by some as insensitive in both its timing and the language used , @entity163 spokesman @entity165 described the convicted killer as ‘ an inspiration to millions ’ who would be free ‘ to compete again in the future ’			0
he told @entity175 : ‘ if he wishes to resume his athletics career , then we would n’t step in his way – we would allow him to compete again in the future			0
’ whether @entity0 would be welcomed back by his fellow athletes is another question			0
athletes and coaches who know him speak of a multi-millionaire whose life had been spiralling dangerously out of control for months before he killed miss @entity7			1
‘ one minute he can be an angel , then dark the next , ’ one athlete said			0
‘ he can get very bleak and angry			0
he ’s used to getting what he wants			0
there are different @entity192 – a kind , polite @entity0 , and a really nasty one			0
there is no point trying to calm down the really nasty @entity0			0
that @entity0 is , frankly , a lunatic			0
’ if @entity0 is jailed , he is expected to serve his sentence at the 107 - year - old @entity198 , formerly known as @entity200 central prison , an institution where gang violence is rife and prisoners spend 23 hours a day in horrendously overcrowded cells			1
his lawyers hope to persuade the prison management to allow @entity0 to use his prosthetic legs , but sources suggest they will be removed because they could be used as a weapon			0
instead , he is likely to be offered a wheelchair and will be housed in a wing with other disabled prisoners			0
yet among those who knew @entity0 , few extend him any sympathy			0
‘ i hope he gets the worst of the worst of what ’s on offer in our prisons , ’ one said yesterday			1
‘ he ’s not a hero – he ’s a violent killer and a coward			2
the world should curse every mention of his name			0

sprinter found guilty of culpable homicide in @entity7 shooting
he will be sentenced on october 13 - crime carries a maximum 15 - year term
but judge @entity24 is advocate of leniency for first - time offenders
expert @entity31 : ‘ he is almost certainly , in my opinion , not going to jail '

miss @entity7 ’s mother , june , 67 , said the verdict ' does *n't* add up '
prosecutors will wait for sentence hearing before deciding if to appeal
