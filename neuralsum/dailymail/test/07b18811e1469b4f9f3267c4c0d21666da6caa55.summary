housing chiefs have been were accused of hypocrisy for opposing plans to revive @entity4 ’s flagship right - to - buy policy			1
the pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3million social tenants was the centrepiece of tuesday ’s @entity12 manifesto launch			1
but housing associations responded furiously – with one board member lambasting the proposal as the ‘ right to steal ’			1
there were even threats of a legal challenge , potentially under @entity21 human rights laws			1
@entity22 ( left ) the @entity24 housing association boss is reported to earn £ 332,000 a year while @entity25 ( right ) of the @entity26 is said to earn £ 314,000 a year @entity22 's modern detached home ( left ) in the @entity28 was bought for £ 750,000 in 2005 while @entity25 's detached farmhouse ( right ) in rural @entity30 was bought for £ 295,000 in 2003 but the bosses of housing associations , which are not for profit , were themselves in the dock after details emerged of their lavish salaries			1
eighty pocket more than mr @entity39 ’s salary of £ 142,500			1
one – @entity40 of @entity41 – takes home an astonishing £ 432,928 , including bonuses			2
five others are on £ 250,000 - plus			0
@entity44 , a @entity12 vice chairman , said : ‘ it ’s a bit rich coming from chief executives who are lining their pockets with six - figure salaries			2
‘ everyone should have the opportunity to buy their own home			2
‘ right to buy has already helped around two million families realise their dream of owning their own home – and by extending it , we ’ll give even more hardworking people the chance to move on and up the housing ladder			1
’ the housing associations said it was wrong that they should be forced to sell their homes at a discount			1
the @entity65 , the trade body for the organisations , pledged to fight the proposals ‘ every step of the way ’			2
and rev @entity71 , a vicar and @entity73 broadcaster who sits on the board of @entity75 , a small housing association in @entity77 , launched a furious attack on @entity79			1
‘ so a housing association , like the one on whose board i sit , goes to the market , raises finance , does deals with contractors and builds urgently needed units for people to live in at social rents and then the government forces us to sell them off at a 35 per cent discount			1
that ’s right to buy ? sounds like right to steal to me			2
’ @entity96 ( left ) of the @entity97 is said to earn £ 264,000 a year while @entity98 ( right ) is reported to earn £ 247,000 a year @entity96 ' townhouse ( left ) in trendy @entity100 has an estimated value of £ 750,000 while @entity98 's five bed - room semi-detached townhouse ( right ) in @entity103 was bought for £ 732,500 in 2006 the policy director of the @entity65 , @entity105 , a @entity107 member in @entity108 , said it was wrong to hand money to ‘ some of the most securely - housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents ’			2
she told the @entity73 : ‘ we are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they ’re worth than you can force @entity121 , or even @entity122			1
‘ so housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale			1
there will be a cost to the taxpayer			0
’ council house tenants in @entity129 can already buy their home at a discount of up to £ 103,900			2
the @entity132 would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all			1
around 2.7million people live in these properties			0
the subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties once they become vacant			0
every house purchased would be replaced ‘ on a one - for - one basis ’			0
unveiling the policy in @entity147 , mr @entity39 said : ‘ part of having a good life is having a home of your own			1
it ’s not about assets and appreciating values – it ’s about someone standing there with their keys in their hand thinking “ this place is mine ”			2
‘ the next @entity12 government will extend the right to buy to all housing association tenants in this country			1
that ’s 1.3million extra families – a whole new generation given the security of a home			2
the pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3million social tenants was the centrepiece of tuesday ’s @entity12 manifesto launch ‘ so let the message ring out from this generation of conservatives : you ’ve worked hard , you ’ve saved , the home you live in , it ’s yours to buy , yours to own			1
‘ the dream of a property - owning democracy is alive – and we will fulfil it			0
’ the plan was welcomed by @entity189 , chief executive of the @entity190 , who said : ‘ the overwhelming majority of @entity193 people of all backgrounds want to own their own home , rather than rent them			0
’ @entity197 , of @entity198 , said last month that he would definitely launch a challenge			0
‘ this is so fundamentally critical to us , ’ he said			0
‘ it would shoot up to the top of our risk map if it was confirmed			0
we are duty bound morally to fight it in any way we possibly can			0
’ industry sources believe the plans could fall foul of charity law , because housing associations are generally prohibited from selling off their assets at below market value			1
one lawyer said it might even breach article 1 , protocol 1 , of the @entity220 , which grants the ‘ right to the peaceful enjoyment of one ’s possessions ’			0
‘ i ca n’t see how this could get through the legal system			0
it ’s completely reckless , ’ said @entity224 , of @entity225			0
@entity229 leader @entity229 said the right - to - buy pledge showed the @entity132 had ‘ run out of ideas ’ , adding that it was just ‘ a poor cover version of one of @entity4 ’s 1980s hits ’			0
housing association chief executives whose salaries have been revealed by @entity238 magazine include @entity239 who was on a package of £ 332,316 in 2013/14			1
four others were : @entity25 of @entity26 , who was on £ 314,416 ; @entity242 of @entity243 ( £ 289,088 ) ; @entity96 of the @entity97 ( £ 264,000 ) ; and @entity98 of the @entity244 ( £ 247,000 )			0
a study by the @entity247 union found that two out of five council houses sold in @entity249 , south - west @entity103 , in the 1980s , are now owned by private landlords , who rent them to tenants			0
it said reviving the policy would benefit private landlords .			0
