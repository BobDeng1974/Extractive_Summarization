@entity1 ’s rollercoaster season came to a spectacular finale on sunday when they pulled off a thrilling three - run victory over @entity4 after @entity5 narrowly failed to add to his reputation as the great finisher of modern limited - overs cricket			1
there was no real context to this sole @entity12 international , with 50 - over cricket dominating the next six months , but the 24,000 crowd at @entity15 were treated to the perfect example of the excitement the shortest format can provide			0
it looked as though a star - studded @entity4 side jam - packed with @entity12 expertise were chasing down @entity1 ’s competitive 180 for seven with ease while @entity23 was at last displaying the class absent throughout this tour			2
smashing : @entity27 produced a magnificent display of clean hitting to boost @entity1 's score good start : @entity32 reverse sweeps his second ball in international cricket to the boundary disappointing : @entity36 was out for a duck as @entity1 stalled during the first powerplay yet @entity1 , who had owed their batting riches to a welcome return to form from @entity27 , clawed their way back into the contest through excellent death bowling from @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity5 showed either incredible self - confidence or arrogance when @entity4 needed 17 off the last over from @entity50 , twice turning down singles and effectively telling his partner @entity52 to leave everything to him			1
but the man who has made his name and his fortune through guiding @entity4 home in last over finishes could not do it this time , managing only a single off the final ball when his perfect script called for him to clear the ropes for victory			2
‘ there are smiles in the changing room after a very tough summer , ’ said stand - in @entity65			0
‘ it ’s great to be part of games like that , it ’ s why you play the game			0
for young guys to experience this was brilliant and it was amazing to see how calm @entity50 was during that last over			0
’ the match was almost a replay of last year ’s @entity84 final in that the vast majority of the sell - out crowd were supporting @entity4 and the pitch , used and dry , was more like @entity88 than @entity89			0
happy boy : @entity27 takes to @entity91 to thank fans for their support long way : @entity95 hit three fours and three sixes in his quick - fire 45 at the top of the order spectacular : @entity101 takes a flying catch to dismiss @entity95 , as @entity4 fielded brilliantly big hitting : @entity27 came in and began to dismantle the @entity105 bowling attack , hitting to all parts out of the ground : @entity27 strikes one of seven maximums as @entity1 accelerated at the end of the innings yet that did not stop @entity1 taking the attack to @entity4 from the moment @entity95 and @entity32 , the big - hitting debutant , took 17 from @entity115 ’s first over and set the tone for a refreshing , modern performance			1
@entity32 ’s first international innings was to end in disappointment , as did that of @entity36 , who was disgracefully booed loudly by a majority of the @entity105 support , presumably because of his @entity124 heritage			0
the trouble with that is that he was born and bred in @entity89 , as was his father			0
at least the rest of @entity1 ’s batsmen thrived in the ‘ away ’ atmosphere , with @entity95 hitting three sixes in his 40 , to lay the foundations for a quite brilliant assault from @entity27 , who looked so out of sorts in the one - day series			1
it has been the most difficult summer for @entity27 , whose form in 50 - over cricket had collapsed to such an extent that questions were being asked about his place and he had appeared to lose ground in the captaincy stakes to @entity144			2
yet this was vintage @entity27 , displaying the unorthodoxy and pure timing that has made him one of the best limited - overs batsmen in the world			0
keeping it going : @entity151 took over the reigns after @entity27 fell in the final over , blasting 21 from 9 balls @entity4 were brilliant in the field , with @entity101 ’s sensational running pouching of @entity95 the best of his four catches , but their bowling was not at its best as one low full toss after another disappeared over the boundary			1
an inability to force the pace against spin was @entity1 ’s downfall in the one - day series but after another tentative start in the middle orders @entity27 soon found his range , 100 coming off the 12 overs of spin @entity1 faced			2
@entity1 saved their best for the last five overs , 81 runs being thrashed by @entity27 , who finally holed out going for his eighth six of the innings , and @entity151 , who returned to the side with a crucial unbeaten 21 off nine balls			1
quicker one : @entity36 saw his second ball go for six before producing a flatter delivery to take a wicket help yourself : @entity186 helps another leg - side delivery to the boundary as @entity1 bowled poorly it was to prove a decisive contribution with @entity4 falling four runs short of the 40 they needed from the last four overs once the key wicket of @entity23 , who hit 66 off 41 balls , had been claimed by @entity46 thanks to an excellent catch from @entity95			1
@entity50 had won the domestic twenty20 tournament for @entity89 by keeping his head in the last over and he did it again here despite @entity5 hitting the first ball of the final over , and far from a poor one , over mid-wicket for six			1
but @entity50 and @entity1 were to have the final word			2
‘ @entity205 is not used to batting at six or seven and it ’s very difficult for a batsman to come in and just hit the ball , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ he was n’t really middling many deliveries so i thought it was a better option for me to keep the strike			0
’ class act : @entity23 put his recent poor form behind him , showing that he is a different player in @entity12 cricket maximum punishment : @entity46 walks back to his mark after being dispatched for another six bowled him : @entity219 beats @entity186 to slow the @entity105 charge but @entity23 kept the runs coming it was a decision that backfired for an @entity105 captain and his team , who have shown much more desire in the limited - overs games than they did in those last three woeful test match performances			2
that 3 - 1 test series triumph will remain the highlight of @entity1 ’s summer but they will have enjoyed ending this most up and down and sometimes traumatic of transitional summers on a high note			0
beauty : @entity237 can do nothing to keep out a fabulous yorker from @entity47 as @entity1 fought back final act : @entity5 hits the last ball of the innings , knowing that anything but a boundary is n't enough over the line : @entity219 celebrates as the ball is fielded securing a win for @entity1 that had looked unlikely			1

@entity27 smashes seven maximums as he makes *71* off *31* balls
@entity95 makes 40 of *25* , @entity144 *26* off *29* as @entity1 post 180/7
*83* scored in fabulous final five overs of @entity1 innings
@entity23 leads the @entity4 chase with brilliant 66
@entity186 takes *advantage* of poor bowling to make *33*
@entity50 *successfully* defends 17 off the final over
@entity5 turns down singles and fails to hit final ball for boundary
