by @entity0 when a strange man attempted to force his way into her @entity5 apartment early in the morning , @entity1 called 911			1
however the call was automatically patched five states away to the @entity9 emergency center - and no one can give her an answer why			2
the singer and bartender had finished work at her bar job after a busy night and had got home late around 4.30am when the incident occurred last month			1
' a few minutes after i got in , there was pounding on my door and someone trying to jiggle my door handle , ' she told @entity23			2
' it was so bizarre ... i dont know how it happened ' : @entity1 has been left without any answers as to why her 911 call for help from @entity29 went straight through to a call center in @entity9 @entity1 , a bartender and singer , had returned home late from work when a man started pounding on the door and ' jiggling the handle ' of her apartment in @entity38 , @entity29 after calling 911 and giving her address , the operator was confused			1
' she asked me again what borough do i live in , and i ’m like @entity38 , ' @entity41 told the station			2
' i was like i live in @entity29 and she ’s like '' oh , you dialed 911 in @entity9 ''			1
’ the @entity29 911 call center is less than two miles from @entity41 ' apartment			1
the @entity49 center , in @entity47 , is over 1,200 miles away			2
@entity41 hung up and tried to call again , but the same thing happened			0
fortunately , the @entity9 operator contacted her @entity29 counterparts with the emergency			2
police arrived at the scene in about 30 minutes			0
however neither @entity41 ' cell provider , @entity58 , or the city of @entity29 could provide answers over what went wrong with the call			1
@entity1 is a singer and bartender and says she is lucky her emergency was not more urgent luckily for @entity41 , the @entity49 operator contacted @entity29 , and police arrived at the apartment block about 70 percent of 911 calls are now made from cell phones			1
when someone dials 911 , the gps chip of their phone usually connects them to to the nearest call center			1
the signal goes via a sattelite			0
when calling from outside , the signal has a clear path , however when calling from inside a building or home , the signal can be muffled			0
operators ask for a location first for this reason			0
find me 911 is a coalition based in @entity88 that is pushing the government to upgrade the country 's 911 system			0
director @entity92 told @entity23 that the technology for the upgrade is readily available but not being used			0
' this is a public safety crisis , really , ' @entity92 said			0
the @entity96 is supposed to implement new rules for indoor cell phone standards by fall .			0
