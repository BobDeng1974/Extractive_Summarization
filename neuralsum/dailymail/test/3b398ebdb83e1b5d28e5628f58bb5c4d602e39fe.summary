@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity2 , the father of 8 - year - old @entity12 , took video that he claims shows police throwing his wife @entity15 on the ground in handcuffs just moments after they reported their son missing			1
this after @entity15 refused to let the officers into their home , something @entity22 claims she was doing for their own safety			1
while inside , someone stole the car , and he and his wife immediately called officers			2
when they arrived on the scene they said @entity15 refused to let them in , and that they thought appeared to be blood inside the home			1
that is when @entity15 reportedly grew belligerent , and can be heard cursing on their body cams , at which point they restrained her			0
she can be heard saying at one point ; ' i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe ! ' @entity22 told @entity60 7 however that his wife was just trying to protect the officers from one of their two dogs in the house , who would have likely attacked them when they came inside			2
@entity15 ( above ) was handcuffed and thrown to the ground by officers , something @entity22 claims he captured in a video and while police found their son in the car roughly two miles away shortly after , and the young boy read a letter thanking them , @entity22 is still upset			1
' we were treated like criminals , ' he said			0
they have now hired an attorney , but former @entity81 agent @entity80 seems to think they may not have a case against police			0
' the people being interviewed get a little defensive , which is natural , police are used to that , ' he explained			0
