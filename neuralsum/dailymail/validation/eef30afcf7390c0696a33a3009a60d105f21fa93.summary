@entity9 mp colonel @entity8 , a member of the defence select committee , called for the @entity11 to sacrifice their careers over plans to slash defence spending despite growing threats from @entity16 and @entity17			1
speaking at a meeting of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , he said the generals should make the people they command their priority and resign on principle , instead of focusing their efforts on ‘ getting another star ’			0
colonel @entity8 , a former @entity3 commander in @entity26 , said @entity28 's military forces were in a ' parlous state ' and could not take any further cuts later he said he was considering resigning himself , from either his seat or the select committee , adding : ‘ i ’m thinking about it to be honest – but that wo n’t make any difference			1
’ his comments came as it emerged more than 6,000 @entity3 troops are preparing to deploy under the command of an @entity5 unit as part of a high readiness reaction force			0

’ colonel @entity8 , who commanded @entity97 forces in @entity26 , said : ‘ if we are really [ in ] a parlous state in defence , why are the @entity11 not tendering their resignations ? ‘ they should actually put their responsibilities to the people who they command as their top priority , rather than getting another star			2
