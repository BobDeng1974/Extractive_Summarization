@entity0 is trying to stop a comedy band from touring , despite @entity3 saying politicians should ‘ let people tell their jokes ’			2
musical duo @entity7 and the @entity8 have taken their show @entity10 on the road , but venues have been bombarded with complaints from @entity0 supporters			1
and the party ’s deputy leader @entity15 has condemned the ‘ distasteful satire ’ , calling on the @entity17 to investigate funding given to theatres hosting the act			1
comedy act @entity8 are on the road with the @entity10 , to the annoyance of @entity0 supporters the bizarre attempt to interfere with a comedy act appears to be at odds with @entity0 ’s strident attacks on political correctness and the fear of giving offence			1
last week mr @entity3 defended a stand - up comic who told a string of jokes targeting foreigners at the @entity0 spring conference			2
but it has emerged the party has tried to prevent the @entity8 shows going ahead			2
the group ’s song about @entity0 suggests the party believes all @entity44 ‘ live off benefits and wo n't let us watch @entity43 ' and wants ' the @entity48 's jubilee [ to ] be every day ' , the website @entity46 reported			2
however writing on the @entity0 website , mr @entity49 said : ‘ everyone is entitled to their own opinion and @entity0 is very much the party of free speech but i think it is wrong that taxpayers money is being used to back this production , " explained mr @entity49			1
@entity0 deputy leader @entity49 has condemned the act as ' distasteful satire ' ‘ it does , of course , show just how much left wing supporters are getting extremely worried about the growing success of @entity0			1
we would n't be under attack from these musical comedians unless we were proving a threat to the established order			2
‘ this blatantly party political rubbish is being staged to coincide with the run - up to the @entity73 elections in may and i am appalled that one of the venues in the much lauded @entity76 in @entity77			1
i would have hoped they had higher standards than giving this show house room			0
‘ i have written to the @entity17 about this matter and also the @entity76 expressing my views about this distasteful satire			1
’ however , one of the venues targeted by complaints says it has no record of the people who claim to be loyal customers offended by the booking			1
the @entity76 in @entity77 said : ‘ we 've never had as many complaints about a show			1
‘ we had calls from people saying they were loyal customers and they come a lot but when we checked their names in our database they 've never bought a ticket before			1
i think it was kind of to give us the scares			0
' lead singer @entity100 insisted his group has not received @entity17 money			0
‘ they might be involved in a small way with some of those venues but that 's a very different thing			0
we 're a comedy group			0
i 've never heard of anyone getting a comedy grant			0
' @entity0 leader @entity3 has previously defended the right of comedians to tell whatever jokes they want at the @entity0 spring conference last week comedian @entity112 sparked controversy with jokes at a gala dinner about @entity118 people , a @entity120 butcher and @entity122 pirates			2
defending the act , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i 'm not going to comment on individual jokes , but i think we 're in huge danger here			0
this was a guy telling jokes about national stereotypes , not racial stereotypes			0
‘ we are heading down a road here where we would kill all humour in this country if we tear things to pieces			0
‘ enough is enough , let people tell their jokes			0
if what they say is inappropriate they wo n't earn a living because they wo n't get booked again			0
