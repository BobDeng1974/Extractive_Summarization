only recently have i apologised properly to the next - door neighbours in @entity2 where i grew up			1
hour after hour i would be outside , hitting a football against a wall which adjoined their house			1
winter or summer , i would be outside from the age of six , kicking the ball			2
my mum passed away in may and at her funeral i met those neighbours again and we had a chuckle about what they had to put up with			2
there were also some garages around the corner , with brick columns in between , and i would try to make sure i passed the ball on to the columns			2
it was just hours and hours of passing , left foot , right foot , whatever the weather			2
@entity25 , pictured at the 1981 fa cup final , says his childhood really helped him define his skills @entity25 insists ' whatever technique i ended up having as a professional was honed in those childhood hours ' the reforms for grassroots football reminded the former @entity35 manager of those hours of practising sometimes i would use a smaller ball , to make it more difficult			1
i would even challenge myself to juggle a marble , to see how well i could do it			2
i am convinced that whatever technique i ended up having as a professional was honed in those childhood hours practising , manipulating the ball			2
eventually , the ball almost becomes a part of your body and you are in total control of it			0
i was reminded of those evenings last week , when the @entity50 , of which i am a member , announced their reforms for grassroots football			1
the key points were that the @entity55 are aiming to build 1,000 3g artificial pitches by 2020 , with 150 football hubs around the country identified as areas that will benefit from them			1
and we will increase the number of qualified @entity64 coaches — that is the level just below the @entity66 badges — from 800 to 3,000			1
the @entity35 team against @entity68 included young players but @entity25 hopes more will filter through now these days it is much more difficult for kids to practise on the street like i did			1
but what we have to do is create environments where young people can get the same kind of advantages that i had practising against the garage doors in @entity2			0
most importantly , we need to create a structure and facilities where control of the football is everything			1
when i played the game , i always loved to manipulate the ball			0
it is not headball , nor chaseball or runball			0
if you can master control of the ball at a young age , you have a hell of chance to be a good player			0
but in @entity35 at times we have struggled with technique			1
it is a problem i have thought about for years as a player and then as @entity35 manager			1
there is no doubt control of the ball has held us back			0
time after time , we talk about our inability to keep possession or about the superior techniques of foreign players			0
but there is nothing inherently superior about foreigners			0
and the climate is n’t hugely different in @entity112 and @entity113			0
what is different are the coaching and the facilities			0
perhaps some people may not appreciate just how revolutionary the installation of a @entity120 pitch can be			0
for decades we ’ve tried to get by on poorly - maintained grass pitches			1
in the winter they can be mud heaps and out of use for weeks on end			0
the likes of @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) are rare cases of @entity35 players in the top flight @entity132 has broken into the @entity134 and @entity35 first teams over the past two impressive seasons on these new pitches , you can play time and time again without damage , meaning they can be used all day and night			1
and the run of the ball is that much smoother , so control of it becomes imperative			0
sometimes , on some pitches that youngsters currently use , kick and run is the only way to play			1
i went to watch my eight - year - old nephew play the other week			1
when we turned up , the grass was so long it made the game ridiculous			0
the ball would not roll properly			0
it did n’t matter how skilful you were			0
it would n’t have made any difference because you could n’t show it on a pitch like that			0
i have always been impressed with how they restructured youth football in @entity165 to produce a generation of technical players			1
they insist that , until the age of eight , football is about playing with the ball , manipulating it , in one - v - one situations			1
they do n’t play matches			0
and when they do play games , at a later age , it is on smaller pitches with proportionate goals			2
the @entity55 have already made great strides in this area , now insisting on small - sided games and smaller goals for youth football			1
i would maybe take it even further			0
i do n’t think you need to be on the bigger pitches until you ’re 16			2
that way , we develop skill rather than physique			0
@entity194 is hopeful that the new plans can boost grassroots football and help develop new @entity35 stars do n’t get me wrong			1
physical strength and stamina are part of the game			0
but they can be added later , when children have grown up			0
the rudiments of mastering a football are what can not be grafted on to an adult			2
decision - making and tactical awareness can also be taught by the qualified coaches			1
mums and dads and volunteers do a great job sustaining our grassroots but there comes a time when professional input is required			2
in the past , it seems that the @entity55 have dealt with our failures by sacking managers			1
since @entity55 chairman @entity194 initiated his commission last year , we are now at least addressing some of the root causes			1
football skills are built at a young age			2
the problems of @entity35 football will never be solved from the top down			1
it is from the grassroots upwards that we will begin to see a change in how we play the game			2
results do not come in eight months but rather over eight years			0
it does not necessarily grab headlines			0
but , believe me , there is more substance in the action taken this week than in all the many dismissals of @entity35 managers over the last 40 years .			1

@entity194 *launched* a second *report* for @entity245 this week
the @entity55 are aiming to build 1,000 3g artificial pitches by 2020 , with 150 football hubs around the country identified as areas that will benefit
the number of qualified @entity254 coaches - that is the level just below the @entity66 badges - will increase from 800 to 3,000
grassroots plans have greater prospect as a result with a plan revolved around local ' football hubs ' to help identify top talent
here , former @entity35 manager @entity25 tells @entity264 about how the problems of @entity35 football will never be solved from the top down
