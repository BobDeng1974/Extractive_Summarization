by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 19:55 est , 12 march 2013 pity the poor souls out there on the highway to hell			1
cars were skidding into ditches or ploughing into snowdrifts … truckers were forced to abandon jack - knifed lorries … people were wrapped in blankets and shivering against the cold			1
for up to 13 hours , motorists were stranded on the @entity14 towards @entity15 when a few miserable inches of snowfall turned the road into a skating rink			1
tea and sympathy : members of the @entity23 approach a stranded motorist on the @entity14 near @entity15 glowing in the dark : in high visibility jackets , the brethren team gathers but – praise the lord – salvation was at hand			1
for the only @entity31 that seemed to work was the resolve of a modest group of @entity36 evangelists , undaunted by the chaos			1
they became ‘ @entity42 ’ by working until dawn to help desperate motorists who must have wondered if hell would freeze over before they were rescued			1
more than 30 @entity23 , as they are called , turned out in a fleet of trucks and four - wheel drive vehicles to tow cars to safety , care for shivering casualties and dispense that most quintessentially @entity50 of comforts – hot tea and @entity54 tarts			1
yesterday they were hailed as ‘ snow saviours ’ by those stuck for hours at @entity57 , a few miles below the end of the @entity59 in @entity60			1
‘ they were absolutely brilliant , ’ one driver said			1
‘ it would take the council a week to organise something like this			2
they were angels and everyone was really grateful to see them			2
’ the @entity23 is a 200 - year - old religious fellowship group without structured hierarchy or formal membership			1
among those on the rescue mission was @entity74 , who works in the medical supply industry			2
sustenance for the needy : tea , crisps and @entity54 tarts in the 4x4 boot for the stranded motorists shining light : @entity84 , from the @entity23 , helping stranded motorists he initially arrived around teatime to find his nephew , who was among those stranded			1
yesterday he said : ‘ when i got up here i realised the severity of the situation and organised the others			2
‘ the road obviously had n’t been gritted , or the snow was too much , and there were cars stuck as far as you could see			2
the snow was just blowing across the road and was gradually turning to ice , making it really treacherous			2
‘ there were about 30 of us with seven 4x4s			1
it was a kind of rapid response unit … we were on the scene within about 45 minutes			2
‘ one of the @entity106 we have has the facilities to make tea and coffee and had plenty of supplies on board , so we were dishing those out to the police as well as people who were stuck in their cars			2
‘ everyone was really grateful			2
a hot drink can mean a lot when you are stuck outside at night			2
‘ by the time we left at about 4.30am the snow ploughs seemed to be on top of the situation			0
’ alas , the @entity124 could n’t reach all parts of the country yesterday			0
despite @entity130 teams working at ‘ full capacity ’ through the night , dozens of stranded @entity128 drivers bombarded the internet with complaints that they never saw a gritter or a snow plough			1
the chaos caused by @entity139 ’s worst spring freeze for 27 years spread rapidly across the country			1
as well as the roads , airports and railways were also hit , bringing most of the south east to a standstill			1
all @entity147 rail services were suspended			0
although snowfall in isolated patches reached 4.7inches , the worst - hit areas of @entity128 and @entity149 experienced only a couple of inches			1
but thanks to the fact that the snow did not settle but turned to ice as temperatures plummeted as low as @entity159 , it became unusually treacherous			1
the @entity42 was expected to have attended more than 15,000 calls by the end of last night – almost double the normal rate			0
@entity164 and @entity165 airports were closed			1
the @entity166 shut for six hours , causing huge delays on the @entity168 in @entity149			1
the @entity168 car park : lorries queue near @entity171 in @entity149 a ferry carrying 500 passengers from @entity174 to @entity175 was stranded at sea in high winds off the @entity175 coast for nearly 20 hours			1
although the @entity130 insisted it had been prepared for the bad weather , some gritters were unable to salt their usual routes because of obstructions or abandoned cars			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we knew this was coming			0
it was forecast , we had plans in place and we followed them			0
’ additional reporting : @entity192 by @entity193 and @entity194 maybe @entity195 grew a little bored with a classic blanket of white			0
so yesterday she put on quite a show , etching amazing shapes in the snow and letting winds and ice carve out the most stunning handiwork			0
@entity0 and @entity205 were amazed to find the windscreen of their car transformed into a snow tube or snow roller			0
game of ice marbles anyone ? individual blades of grass bear droplets of water , frozen as they sprayed from a fountain it was created thanks to a combination of lying snow and high winds , which rolled a layer of snow into the distinctive curled shape before another layer fell on the glass			0
the unusual phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature , ice , snow , moisture and wind			0
the @entity236 , from @entity237 , @entity238 , who found the snow roll on their @entity241 , decided against de-icing the windscreen until they had captured its beauty in a photo			0
roll up for the show : the snow tube left on the windscreen of @entity0 and @entity205 's car that was n’t the end to @entity195 ’s calling cards			0
over in @entity254 , @entity255 , she left the grass scattered with a collection of ‘ ice marbles ’			0
blades bore individual bubbles of ice , formed after water spray from a nearby fountain froze as soon as it hit the ground			1
the spray also decorated a nearby park bench with a fringe of icicles , which formed as the water froze before it could drip off the wood			0
snow tubes are most commonly found in the frozen extremes of @entity274 and are also known as snow rollers , snow bales and snow doughnuts			0
fringed in ice : a bench etched in white @entity282 forecaster @entity281 was delighted at the sight			0
‘ it looks like the snow has melted slightly and the wind has peeled it off the windscreen , forming a roll , and fresh snow has fallen on to the windscreen , ’ she said			0
‘ i suppose it ’s nature ’s version of making a snowman			0
‘ a classic snow roll will happen mostly in @entity274 and in @entity297 , and they can be as small as a tennis ball or as large as 2ft across – depending on how strong the wind is and how smooth the surface of the snow is			0
’ icy conditions : spray from a fountain creating ice formations in @entity254 , @entity255			0
