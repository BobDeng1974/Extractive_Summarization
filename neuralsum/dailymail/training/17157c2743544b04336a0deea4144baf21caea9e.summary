by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 20 august 2013 the extraordinary moment a meteor exploded in the @entity4 's upper atmosphere has been accidentally captured by a @entity6 photographer and designer			1
@entity8 was photographing the 2013 @entity9 last week when he managed to record the rarely - seen event of a meteor breaking apart in the @entity4 's atmosphere			1
initially the designer thought he had photographed a meteor explosion and the debris scattering during his time lapse sequence , but in fact he captured the rocky body being ' torn apart ' in the upper atmosphere			1
2013 @entity9 : @entity20 from @entity21 on @entity22			2
astronomer @entity23 told @entity24 that mr @entity8 captured : ' a persistent train after a @entity9 fireball , being torn apart by upper atmosphere wind shear			1
' the meteor therefore did explode but did not leave debris behind			0
instead it left an expanding ring of glowing hot gas called a ' persistent train '			2
the charged gas has been heated by compression caused by the meteor and sheds electrons , similar to how a neon sign works , according to mr @entity8			2
meteors explode in this way relatively often but the events are not regularly documented			0
@entity8 was photographing the 2013 @entity9 last week from his garden in @entity42 when he managed to record the unusual event of a meteor breaking apart in the @entity4 's atmosphere ( pictured ) he said the event probably lasted about 20 minutes as he was taking 20 second exposures every 22 seconds			1
mr @entity8 filmed the explosion using his @entity50 18 megapixel digital single - lens reflex camera and zoomed in on the action to film the explosion at 24 frames per second and 12 frames per second			2
he said he could n't believe what he saw when processing the images of the @entity9 meteor shower			0
mr @entity8 said he took the video early in the morning on 12 august from his garden in @entity60 , @entity42			1
he said : ' the fade to white is not an edit - it is overexposure due to the sun coming up			0
from what i can tell , the timelapse sequence of the explosion and expanding debris span an actual time of approximately 20 minutes			0
' one astronomy expert who looked at the video confirmed it is legitimate			0
@entity75 said : ' what cinches it for me is that the meteor was moving in the right direction for a perseid ... i see @entity81 rising to the right , the plane of the @entity84 and @entity85 just above centre ' the astronomer said he has witnessed several meteors that leave smoke trains in their wake , which he examines with binoculars .			0
