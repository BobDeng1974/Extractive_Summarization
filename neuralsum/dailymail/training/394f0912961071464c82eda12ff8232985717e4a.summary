' he was kind of fumbling around with it for a good three or four minutes , trying to decide if he wanted to do it or not			2
' @entity43 said that he was visiting the @entity18 when the crowd gathered round @entity1 caused him to check out what was going on			2
however , some doubt that the video is real and may in fact just be a clever marketing or viral video ploy and the manager at @entity61 said that none of his staff recalled @entity1 being inside on sunday			0
