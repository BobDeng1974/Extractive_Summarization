by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 7 april 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 7 april 2012 the ' @entity2 ' setting sail for her fateful maiden voyage a century ago is an image those who waved her off will never forget			0
but while the enduring memory of the @entity11 is of the famous liner sinking into the @entity13 , one man captured a rare snapshot of the moment she set off on her one and only journey			1
sailing smoothly through the waves just off @entity20 , this 100 - year - old photograph shows the doomed boat taking to the icy seas on april 10th , 1912			1
it was captured by then 15 - year - old @entity24 , who used the picturesque scene of his uncle 's sea - facing back garden on the @entity28 to photograph the giant vessel as it loomed into view off the south coast			1
during the seven hours before being rescued from the @entity11 ( pictured ) , @entity32 and her musical pig comforted children onboard a nearby lifeboat mr @entity24 's uncle 's house on the @entity28 offered spectacular views of ships sailing from @entity20 out towards the @entity40 , with the teenager using a brownie box camera to immortalise the moment			1
the young mr @entity24 , a keen amateur photographer , took a picture and stowed the image away into his album along with pictures of his friends and family , unaware of just how significant his quickly - taken photograph would later become			1
when disaster struck and the @entity11 plunged into the @entity13 four days after mr @entity24 's picture , the teenager knew he had captured an iconic moment , but nonetheless opted to keep his memento safe in the family album			1
respected : @entity24 , pictured here as a young man in photographs from the same album as the @entity11 picture , maintained an interest in photography but went on to become a gp in @entity64			1
the ' brownie ' series of cameras used by mr @entity24 for his titanic picture were introduced around 1900 and helped popularise photography at the turn of the century			1
a precursor to the modern disposable camera , early versions consisted simply of a cardboard box with a meniscus lens inside			0
although other kinds of box cameras existed at the time and continued to be produced for decades , the most successful model initially was the ' @entity80 ' made by @entity81 named after ' @entity85 ' comic strips , their makers marketed the camera with the slogan , ' you push the button , we do the rest '			0
the photograph remained in his possession his entire life as mr @entity24 married , had children , and established himself as a respected gp in @entity64			2
when his second wife @entity98 was moved into an old people 's home , however , his children began clearing possessions from @entity24 and @entity98 's bungalow in @entity103 , @entity104			2
it was then they came across the album and its rare contents belonging to their father , who died in 1967 aged 70			0
had they not saved the rare image in the album , the momentous picture could have been lost forever			2
mr @entity24 's son @entity113 found the picture , which had a noticeable fold down the middle and was stuck in the album with a handwritten caption : ' @entity119 ' : @entity120 '			1
@entity113 has since had the iconic photograph digitally restored in time for the 100th anniversary of the @entity11 's sinking , but still plans to keep the picture in the family			2
the 77 - year - old retired meetings manager , from @entity127 , said : ' when i was in my mid- 20s he happened to tell me in passing that he had taken a picture of the @entity11 as she came out of @entity20 water			1
' i remember it stuck in my mind when he told me at the time , and it has been a subject which has fascinated a lot of people ever since			0
' he realised how significant a picture it was some time later , but decided to keep it in his album			0
' like everyone else the @entity11 had a big impact on him and he was shocked by what happened			0
' my father was quite a religious man and was quite moved by the fact that the band on the @entity11 apparently played ' @entity147 ' before it went down			0
' describing the moment he found the photo his father had told him about decades earlier , grandfather @entity113 added : ' it was a split second decision whether to keep the album as it was his and i did n't know anyone else in the pictures , but i 'm not glad i did			0
' century - old : the original image taken by @entity24 has a fold down the middle next to the caption : ' @entity159 - @entity120 ' first and only journey : a route map of the route taken by the @entity11 on its doomed maiden voyage keeping it in the family : retired meeting manager @entity166 , 77 , says he intends to keep his father 's momentous 100 - year - old @entity11 photograph @entity170 , from @entity172 - based @entity171 , who restored the photo , said : ' it has been a fantastic experience and a privelege to work on a picture like this one			1
' when people find pictures like this one it is often a journey of discovery , and this image is no different			0
' @entity166 revealed that he discovered the photo album in his late father 's home in @entity104 in around 1985 , but kept hold of it since then and has only recently had it digitally restored			0
@entity190 : the sinking of the @entity11 , immortalised here in the 1997 @entity194 blockbuster , happened 100 years ago this month watery tomb : the bow of the @entity11 at rest on the bottom of the @entity13 , about 400 miles southeast of @entity199 dozens of artifacts from the world 's most famous ship have emerged since it sank on april 15 , 1912			2
numerous events have also taken place in the lead up to the 100th anniversary of its sinking			0
the @entity211 shipyard where the @entity11 was built has been revitalised in time for the landmark date , while an eye - catching , dockside centre opened just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the ship 's sinking .			2
