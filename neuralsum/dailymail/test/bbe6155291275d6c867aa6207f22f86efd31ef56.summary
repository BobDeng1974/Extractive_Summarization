incredible satellite images have shown a massive sandstorm almost as large as the @entity3 billowing across the @entity4			1
the sandstorm wrecked havoc across the area last week , causing traffic accidents , the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents			1
images show the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 and reaching as far east as @entity19 and @entity20 over a period of seven days			1
along the way it caused chaos across the area 's major cities including @entity45 and @entity26 , where some locations were reduced to zero visibility , streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut			2
the @entity52 said : ' the blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations , disrupting ground transportation , air traffic , and also closing schools			0
' visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at @entity60 , which is one of the world â€™s busiest in terms of volume of flights			0
' more than 450 @entity68 flights were cancelled between wednesday and friday - which equals 33 per cent of the carrier 's 1,526 scheduled flights , the @entity66 reported			0
on top of this , 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in @entity76 , @entity45 and @entity77			0
according to the @entity81 , strong winds aggravated the problem , causing a ' near complete lack of vision in daylight ' , the @entity78 and @entity79 said			0
despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in that part of the world , they are not generally so big and rarely wreak so much havoc			0
in this instance , the storm also blew across @entity16 's @entity94 - the world 's second largest desert which reaches into @entity33 and @entity17			1
many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences			2
the sandstorm swept across much of the @entity4 , seen here with borders illustrated by the blue lines			1
pictured is @entity16 ( top left ) , @entity33 ( bottom ) , @entity17 ( right ) and the @entity18 ( top right ) it also billowed across the @entity94 - the world 's second largest desert which is located in @entity16			1
here it is pictured by satellite , revealing its distinct sand dune patterns			2

photographs taken by satellite show sandstorm hitting @entity4
massive dust cloud was *believed* to be almost as large as the @entity3
it billowed across @entity16 , the @entity18 , @entity17 and as far east as @entity19
