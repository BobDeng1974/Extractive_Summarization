coal will become more in demand than oil by 2020 driven by growth in @entity5 and @entity6 , despite campaigns to reduce carbon emissions across the globe , a new report reveals			1
marking a return to an era reminiscent of @entity16 's industrial revolution , the rapidly expanding economies in the @entity12 are turning to coal since it is cheaper and more reliable than oil or renewable energy sources , energy consultancy firm @entity10 said on monday			0
rising demand in @entity5 and @entity6 will push coal past oil as the two @entity23 powerhouses will need to rely on the comparatively cheaper fuel to power their economies			1
coal demand in the @entity27 , @entity28 and the rest of @entity30 will hold steady			1
smog : @entity5 has access to vast swathes of coal , which is cheaper for it to use than other fossil fuels			2
pictured , @entity36 , in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity5 , where coal is mined , then trucked nearby to the power stations and factories in the region little choice : @entity5 has no alternative to coal , with its domestic gas output limited , and liquefied natural gas ( @entity46 ) imports more costly than coal global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25 per cent by the end of the decade to 4,500 million tonnes of oil equivalent , overtaking oil at 4,400 million tonnes , according to @entity51 in a presentation on monday at the @entity53			1
' @entity5 's demand for coal will almost single - handedly propel the growth of coal as the dominant global fuel , ' said @entity57 , president of global markets at @entity51			1
' unlike alternatives , it is plentiful and affordable			0
' @entity5 - already the top consumer - will drive two - thirds of the growth in global coal use this decade			1
half of @entity5 's power generation capacity to be built between 2012 and 2020 will be coal - fired , said @entity67			2
@entity5 has no alternative to coal , with its domestic gas output limited , and liquefied natural gas ( @entity46 ) imports more costly than coal , @entity57 said			2
@entity5 's demand for coal will almost single handedly propel it to the most demanded fuel on the planet , the report says ' renewables can not provide base load power			1
this leaves coal as the primary energy source , ' he said			0
power infrastructure provider @entity83 estimated that across @entity30 close to half of the 600 gigawatt of new power generators to be built over the next five years will be coal - fired , @entity81 , a vice president at the company said			2
' coal prices are low , ' he said , adding that coal is about one - third of the price of lng in @entity30 and about half of the gas price in @entity28			1
@entity92 supply is also supporting demand for coal			0
the traded volumes of coal will increase by a further 20 per cent by 2020 , @entity81 said , including supply of lower grade coal from @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
' as the lower grade coal comes into the market , further downward pressure on prices will further drive demand , ' he said			0
currently , oil is the most used fuel the world over , but coal is expected to be more in demand by 2020 excess supply and faltering demand growth have depressed global coal prices this year			2
@entity28 coal futures have tumbled more than 20 per cent , while @entity98 coal prices have plummeted from the record $ 130 per tonne hit in 2011 to around $ 80 per tonne as @entity5 's demand grew slower than expected			1
' if you take @entity5 and @entity6 out of the equation , what is more surprising is that under current regulations , coal demand in the rest of the world will remain at current levels , ' @entity57 said			1
high fuel import costs and nuclear issues will support coal use throughout @entity30 , while in @entity127 coal is still competitive in many locations despite abundant low - cost shale gas			0
' the struggling economy and low coal prices has rendered the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) @entity130 ( @entity131 ) ineffective , ' @entity57 said			0
' the carbon price will need to reach 40 euros per tonne to encourage fuel switching , which is unlikely before 2020			0
' in @entity139 , coal will be the biggest winner in the region 's energy mix. @entity143 will generate nearly half of @entity139 's electricity by 2035 , up from less than a third now , the @entity137 said in early october			0
this will contribute to a doubling of the region 's energy - related carbon dioxide emissions to 2.3 gigatonnes by 2035 , according to the @entity137 .			0

economic growth in @entity5 and @entity6 are driving global demand for coal
coal is plentiful and more affordable for both @entity5 and @entity6
coal demand in the @entity27 , @entity28 and rest of @entity30 will remain steady
