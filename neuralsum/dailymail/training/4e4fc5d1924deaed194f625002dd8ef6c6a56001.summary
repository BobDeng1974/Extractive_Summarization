the last one to be made in @entity3 has been taken off the factory floor as @entity9 stopped manufacturing the machine at its @entity12 factory			1
the company has made 5.9 million in @entity14 since 1985 and has sent its last typewriter to the @entity16 in @entity17 to be displayed as an artefact			1
historic : @entity20 , a worker at the factory since 1989 , made the last typewriter and is shown here doing a final test on the production line the original : this machine dates back to july 1985 and was the first to be made at @entity9 's @entity14 factory after 130 years it is has finally become a victim of the computer - dominated world as @entity9 said demand in @entity3 had fallen to the point where it was no longer financially viable to keep making them			1
@entity20 , a worker at the factory since 1989 , made the last typewriter			2
' if people ever ask me , i can always say now , as a strange question , that i ’ve made the last typewriter in the @entity3 , ' he said			0
' i have made so many typewriters down the years			1
i once managed to make one with my eyes closed			0
' made in @entity3 : @entity43 from the @entity16 is handed the artefact by @entity45 and @entity46 from brother @entity3 end of an era : the typewriter are of manufacturing at @entity9 's factory in @entity14 ( pictured ) ended today the company said that it still had significant sales in the @entity54 - where government departments and some offices still use them - but @entity9 's factory in the @entity59 produces enough typewriters to serve this market			1
despite its @entity3 - sounding name @entity9 is a @entity64 company from @entity65 that started life in 1908 as the @entity67			1
it was given an @entity70 title , @entity9 , in 1954 to establish itself in the international market			1
four years later a @entity73 division was set up in 1958 in @entity74 and ten years later moved its @entity3 headquarters to @entity76 in @entity77 after they bought the famous @entity80 brand			1
in 2012 , @entity9 's annual turnover was in excess of £ 3.8bn per year with its main manufacturing centres in @entity84 , @entity85 and soon @entity86			1
it still does have production in the @entity3 and is also well known for sponsoring @entity89 between 1989 and 1999 , still one of the longest shirt deals in @entity3 football history			1
the company will continue to use the @entity14 factory to run a recycling scheme for printer cartridges as well as to make other office technology			1
@entity3 boss @entity46 said the typewriter still held ' a special place in the hearts ' of members of the public			0
he said : ' because of this , and the typewriter ’s importance in the history of business communication , we felt that giving it a home at the @entity16 would be a fitting tribute			1
' typewriters were first mass produced by the @entity114 company in the 1870s			2
the @entity16 ’s assistant curator of technologies and engineering , @entity116 , said staff were excited to add the item ' to our rich collection of typewriters ' which numbers more than 200			1
she said : ' this model will enable us to tell the story of how technology has evolved in accordance with our communication needs			0
' the first known typewriter was invented in the @entity54 in 1830 by @entity132			0
but typewriters did not become a commercial success until the 1870s when inventors @entity136 - who also invented the qwerty keyboard - and @entity139 made a deal with the @entity114 company to mass produce their machines			2
the first recorded idea for a typewriter is dated 1714 when an @entity70 called @entity145 patented his idea for " an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another			0
" however , it was n't until 1808 that @entity154 @entity153 built the first working machine of its kind			0
@entity153 made the typewriter for his friend @entity159 , a story which was the basis of a novel by @entity162 published in 2010			0
it was n't until 1870 when @entity166 pastor @entity165 invented his ' writing ball , ' that production of typewriter - like machines began on an industrial level			2
typewriters as we know them now started to circulate after the introduction in 1874 of the @entity172 in the @entity54			0
this machine brought in the qwerty keyboard , and was designed by @entity175 journalist , poet , and part - time inventor @entity136			0
the qwerty keyboard was designed to solve problems during printing , separating frequently - used pairs of type - bars so that the type - bars would not clash and get stuck at the printing point			0
the @entity172 and @entity139 looked very like a sewing machine and had limited success on the market			0
the @entity114 later became the commercial leaders in typewriters and is the basis of all such machines since			0
it was the @entity192 typewriter that captured the market place for the coming decades			0
by the 1920 's all brands were an imitation of the @entity192 , which boasted frontstroke , qwerty , typebar machines printing through a ribbon , and the one shift key and four banks of keys .			2
