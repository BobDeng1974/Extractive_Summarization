in @entity3 ’s first week as @entity2 manager , he offered to help a wayward forward with extra shooting practice after training only to be told by the player he had an important appointment with his tattooist			1
suffice to say , that player is now pursuing a career away from @entity12			0
when it comes to laying down the football law , it ’s a case of ‘ like father , like son ’ in the @entity3 family			2
to say @entity3 is a replica of his legendary dad @entity20 , who won the league championship with @entity22 and @entity23 and two @entity24 with @entity23 , is simplifying things slightly			1
@entity26 manager @entity3 has overseen 13 victories in 16 cup ties @entity29 , @entity3 's father , who won the league championship with @entity22 and @entity23 @entity3 ( right ) has replicated his late father @entity20 ( left ) as an outstanding football manager certainly , @entity20 would never have been accused of being disrespectful to match officials as @entity3 was by @entity35 manager @entity34 after a stormy @entity37 tie on tuesday night , when @entity38 won 1 - 0 to record their 13th victory in 16 cup ties under @entity3			1
the clash with @entity42 in january will be their second major semi-final in two seasons			1
yet there are overpowering similarities , and not just because @entity3 seems to be physically morphing into his old man , so much so that brother @entity48 — who works as a scout for the @entity50 — has noticed he is subconsciously replicating some of their father ’s mannerisms			2
@entity53 2001 - 02 semi-final of @entity55 beat : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60			2
@entity22 2008 - 09 semi-final of @entity37 beat : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66			1
@entity2 2013 - 14 semi-final of @entity68 beat : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity23 , @entity73			1
@entity2 2014 - 15 semi-final of @entity37 beat : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity35			1
@entity80 - managed sides have been knocked out of cup competitions twice by @entity82 — the 2005 - 06 @entity68 and the 2008 - 09 @entity37 — but managed to avoid defeat in the home match of both ties			2
@entity3 is not only strong on discipline and team ethic , he has also inherited the knack of maximising his players ’ abilities			2
against @entity35 , @entity3 gave a debut to @entity93 , who was playing non-league football with @entity95 a few weeks ago , selected right winger @entity96 at right back and started with 17 - year - old @entity97 in midfield			1
@entity20 bought striker @entity99 from @entity100 for £ 2,000 and turned him into a @entity102 winner , saved the career of @entity104 by shifting him from centre forward to centre half and picked 18 - year - old @entity107 for a @entity102 final against @entity109			1
like @entity110 , @entity3 believes in wingers and keeping instructions simple			2
one pep talk to a no 11 lasted four words : ‘ run at your man ’			0
club owners @entity119 and @entity122 prince @entity121 will also be relieved to see some good publicity come the club ’s way after the mess they made of offering convicted rapist @entity128 a chance to train with them			0
blades midfielder @entity131 says @entity3 has raised expectations in a way you can imagine @entity20 doing at @entity22 and @entity23			1
‘ he wants everyone bang at it			0
he wo n’t let your standards drop			0
he wants you to play until the last whistle is blown , ’ @entity131 explains			0
@entity3 is not afraid to take risks and deployed winger @entity96 at right back against @entity35 @entity3 also started 17 - year - old @entity97 ( centre ) in midfield during his side 's 1 - 0 against the @entity35 unlike @entity20 , 48 - year - old @entity3 is happier to give credit to his players and the fans for the fantastic run			1
their knockout prowess makes their position of only fifth in @entity38 all the more strange			0
@entity12 was a bearpit on tuesday and made any club who do n’t take the cups seriously look ridiculous			2
‘ it was a remarkable effort by the players and the supporters , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ we went for it			0
we try to do that in most games but have n’t quite had the breaks			0
‘ the 14 lads we put out there gave everything			0
nights like that are very special because of the atmosphere			0
’ tempers fray on the touchline as @entity2 coach @entity172 is sent to the stands at @entity12 @entity3 holds out his hands as @entity34 walks off and refuses to shake hands with his counterpart of course , there had to be controversy , too , with a @entity3 involved			1
@entity34 refused to shake hands due to what he considered a lack of respect from the @entity50 bench — including coach @entity172 , who was sent to the stands — towards fourth official @entity185			0
even @entity29 would have been hard - pressed to beat @entity3 ’s one - liner about the snub			1
‘ to say i ’m not too concerned is an understatement — i could n’t care less , ’ he said			0
like father , like son			0
@entity2 players celebrate the opening goal as @entity193 ( left ) shows his frustrations @entity2 players celebrate after producing a @entity37 upset at @entity12			1

@entity2 defeated @entity35 1 - 0 in the @entity37 quarter - final on tuesday evening
