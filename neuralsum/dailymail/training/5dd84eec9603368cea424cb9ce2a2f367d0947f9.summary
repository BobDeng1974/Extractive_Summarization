@entity0 has expressed hope that a compromise deal can still be reached to keep @entity3 at @entity4 beyond the end of the season			1
commons spoke out after the 4 - 3 @entity9 defeat from @entity10 on thursday evening , insisting the current deal on the table was unacceptable and confirming he was after a longer agreement to fulfil his wish of remaining in @entity16			1
@entity0 responded on friday by stating that the 31 - year - old had not simply been offered a 12 - month extension , but rather that the club was trying to ‘ structure ’ a deal with the potential for a longer stay if certain criteria are met			1
@entity3 ( centre ) believes his latest contract offer from @entity4 is unacceptable @entity0 is confident @entity4 can strike a deal to keep commons at @entity29 @entity31 clubs are monitoring the impasse ahead of next month ’s transfer window , but @entity0 claimed @entity4 were happy to keep working towards a possible agreement			1
‘ it ’s about negotiation , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity3 wants something , we want something and it ’s about agreeing on something that we both want to do			1
‘ it is not right to say that he is only being offered a one - year deal			2
we are talking about a structured deal			2
that ’s where the difference is			0
‘ there is no deadline for an agreement			0
he has a contract until the end of the season , so there is no big rush			2
the rush will be if he can find some other clubs in january			0
but if he looks at the contract , he is going to stay here for the rest of the season			1
‘ it ’s not a case of him being offered the contract and told to take it or leave it			2
if it ’s from him , then he is playing a hardball game and we will see			0
commons in action during @entity4 's 4 - 3 @entity9 defeat against @entity10 ‘ i still see a future for him here			1
he is a good player			0
’ asked if the contract could be appearance - linked , @entity0 said : ‘ that ’s the structure of the deal , yes			1
we are talking about different things when you have older players			0
i had the same thing at @entity83			0
if older players get very long contracts , then you never know with them			0
‘ if they get a bad injury , how long can they keep up ? are they keeping their legs ? and when is their passion gone ? so if you give them a long contract it is a risk for the club			0
that ’s why we need to think about what we are doing			0
‘ but of course there are circumstances which could keep him here for three or four years			0
that ’s up to @entity3 and the club to agree			1
commons is adamant he wants to remain with @entity4 but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward ' it is a positive thing that both parties want it			1
’ meanwhile , @entity4 are waiting to discover if they will be back in the @entity113 dock after a flare was let off among their supporters at the game in @entity117			1
if @entity113 match delegate @entity118 includes the incident — which led to a clash with @entity122 police — then @entity4 are likely to face punishment			2
club officials had told supporters not to bring flares to the game and warned that it could lead to disciplinary action from the governing body			0
@entity0 's side were beaten by @entity10 in the dead rubber match on thursday night			2

@entity0 hoping @entity3 signs new @entity4 deal
commons admits he is *n't* happy with @entity4 contract offer
commons : ' has an offer been made ? not that i want to sign '
but the *midfielder* insists he wants to stay at @entity29
