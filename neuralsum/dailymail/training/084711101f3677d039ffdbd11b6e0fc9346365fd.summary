by @entity0 when our luggage disappears on the conveyor belt at check - in we do n't expect it to be given the full vip treatment , though we would likely expect that it not be tossed brazenly about on the tarmac			0
the latter is precisely what happened on at least one @entity10 flight this week , as captured on amateur video , with one suitcase even bouncing on the ground			1
the flight was leaving @entity16 's @entity15 , outside @entity17 , when baggage handlers were recorded at work by a passenger on another plane , with the video posted on @entity23 by user @entity24			1
the next handler then tosses the luggage into the cargo hold where it 's packed it by another staff member			0
@entity10 never claims to be the most luxury carrier but it does proudly promote its high standards when it comes to punctuality and looking after your luggage with ' near - perfect baggage handling '			1
' we are focussed on , and committed to , bringing you the lowest fares and most on - time flights out of all our competitors , ' the budget carrier 's official website states			2
' of course there are some things we never compromise on - most importantly your safety , but also our top drawer punctuality , our near - perfect baggage handling , and our efficient ‘ green ’ policy			0
' too far : this bag was hurled passed the handler receiving the luggage before putting it onto the place @entity10 released a statement about the incident , telling the @entity76 : ' the handling of these bags by our handling agents in @entity15 is clearly in breach of @entity10 bag handling guidelines and will not be tolerated			0
' @entity10 has instructed the @entity15 authority that we want these two individuals removed from handling @entity10 flights and we have received assurances that this cavalier treatment of our customers ’ bags will not be repeated			2
