by @entity0 myth ? scientists claim the myth that humans only use 10 per cent of their brains was made up by early psychologists it is a concept that has been repeated so often that it has almost become accepted wisdom			1
but the old saying that human beings use only 10 per cent of their brains is actually a myth , scientists say			1
the fallacy forms the central concept in @entity16 ’s forthcoming blockbuster , in which she plays a character who ‘ learns ’ to use her entire brain			0
@entity19 , a sci - fi to be released next month , features @entity16 using her newly discovered brainpower to develop lightning quick reflexes and even to control time			0
in the film , directed by @entity26 , @entity24 plays a neuroscientist who says : ‘ it is estimated most human beings only use 10 per cent of the brain ’s capacity			0
‘ imagine if we could access 100 per cent			0
interesting things begin to happen			0
’ but real - life neuroscientists are unimpressed			2
@entity35 , professor of clinical neuropsychology at the @entity36 , said the idea that we only use a small percentage of our brain ‘ does n’t make any sense ’			1
the entire brain is active and in use all the time - the neurons , the nerve cells involved in thought - are always doing something			2
different regions of the brain are used for different bodily functions , such as seeing , hearing , speaking and controlling muscles			0
the idea that 90 per cent of the brain is just unused does not stand up to analysis , professor @entity35 said			2
she thinks the 10 per cent figure was simply plucked out of the air by early psychologists before it was famous in @entity59 ’s 1936 book , @entity60			1
incorrect ? the myth is the subject of a new @entity16 sci - fi thriller but scientists rebuke the idea @entity66 , a neuroscientist at @entity67 in the @entity68 , thinks the myth has been perpetuated by the self - help industry			1
people like to believe the 10 per cent myth so they can hope for self - improvement , he suggests , and the concept of working hard to ‘ expand the mind ’ is an attractive one			0
it is also a concept believed by 65 per cent of @entity68 , according to a survey last year by the @entity79 for @entity81 ’s research - 5 per cent more than believe in evolution .			1

myth that we only use part of brain ' does *n't* make sense ' , scientists say
@entity36 professor claims early psychologists *fabricated* figure
@entity68 neuroscientists claim myth has been perpetuated by self - help industry
