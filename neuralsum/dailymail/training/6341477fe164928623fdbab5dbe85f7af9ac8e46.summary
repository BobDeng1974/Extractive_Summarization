handwriting is so unique to an individual , it can be used in court to identify suspects and victims			0
but what would happen if you took all the different ways people around the world write the latin alphabet letters and combined them into a single font ? that was the thinking behind pen maker @entity14 ’s latest experiment - but the result is a basic , and somewhat childlike , typeface			1
@entity17 pen maker @entity14 analysed 868,496 characters from handwriting from 112 countries to create an average typeface alphabet ( pictured )			1
the alphabet can be explored by gender , age , country and handedness recent research from the @entity28 in the @entity29 , found that a person 's handwriting can give away clues about 5,000 different personality traits			1
these traits are revealed based on the way people space their letters , how they sign their name , and even how they connect the letter ' o ' and 's ' to other letters in a word			0
for example , people with small handwriting tend to be shy , studious and meticulous , whereas outgoing people who love attention will have larger handwriting			0
if handwriting slants to the right the person is open to new experiences and enjoy meeting new people			0
if handwriting slants to the left , that person tends to keep themselves to themselves			0
procrastinators tend to dot their ' i 's and ' j 's to the left of the base letter , while child - like personality types will draw their dots as circles			2
to begin analysing the world ’s handwriting , @entity17 - based @entity14 asked people to contribute their handwriting to the @entity71 site			1
the firm used software to plot the shape and motion of each letter , and has analysed a total of 868,496 characters from 113 countries at the time of writing			1
this was taken from more than 400,000 samples			0
each of these letters were placed on top of each other to find the typical shape and motion , and these were used to form an average letter - shown on the site in yellow			1
the alphabet can be explored by gender , age , country , handedness and industry			1
the darker the shading behind a letter , the more uniform it was written across contributors , while the lighter the shading , the more freeform the handwriting			1
this shading is also determined by how many people from that country and industry contributed handwriting			2
the number of characters used to form the average letter is shown beneath each one			1
the darker the shading behind a letter , the more uniform it was written across contributors , while the lighter the shading , the more free - form the handwriting			1
left - handed people tend to write letters more narrow than right - handed people although the writing style between the @entity125 and @entity29 , for example , is very similar across the entire alphabet , there are dramatic differences between @entity128 and @entity129			2
in the latter ( pictured left ) the line through the letter ' f ' is wavy , while the style of the @entity128 ' f ' ( pictured right ) is more fluid and curved people in the education industry ( pictured left ) tend to write their letter ' @entity143 's more neatly than service people ( pictured centre ) , while people in the traffic industry ( pictured right ) write more curved @entity144 although the writing style between the @entity125 and @entity29 , for example , is very similar across the entire alphabet , there are dramatic differences between @entity128 and @entity129			2
in the latter , the line through the letter ‘ f ’ is wavy , while the style of the @entity152 ’ is more fluid and curved			0
across the board , left - handed people tend to write letters more narrow than right - handed people , and older people tend to leave bigger gaps between the lines of the letters			0
hovering over each letter in the categories reveals the different shapes that contributed to the average letter ( pictured left )			2
on the site 's homepage , these letters also show the name and location , where available ( right ) this image shows that the way different ages write the letter ' r ' is similar across the board			0
however , the darker shading behind the 45 to 59 age group suggests they are more likely to write the letter in the same way			1
younger people write the letter taller and thinner than other groups people in the education industry tend to write their letter ‘ g ’s more neatly than service people , while people in the traffic industry have more curved @entity144			0
hovering over each letter in the categories reveals the different shapes that contributed to the average letter			2
on the site 's homepage , these letters also show the name and location , where available			0
the company is still looking for contributors at the experiment 's website .			0

pen maker @entity14 has analysed 868,496 characters from 112 countries
every letter has been combined to create an average typeface alphabet
@entity201 can be explored by gender , age , country and handedness
the darker the shading behind a letter , the more uniform it was written across contributors
the lighter the shading , the more free - form the handwriting appeared
