by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 15 may 2013 first we had breast milk ice cream			1
then there was breast milk jewellery			1
and now pairs of tiny baby booties made from donated breast milk have been created by @entity9 designers			1
simple kitchen equipment was used by @entity11 and @entity12 , both lecturers at the @entity14 in @entity15 , to transform proteins in the milk into a hard plastic - type material which was then moulded into the booties			1
they can not be worn , but they have been created using milk donated by a mother to promote @entity24 this sunday			1
the tiny , one - inch booties were created using donated breast milk , from which proteins were extracted and then used to create a hard plastic - type material the inch - long booties are not the first type of sustainable footwear to have been created by the innovative designers			1
the pair have made other sorts of shoe from unusual waste materials			1
they have created children 's slippers from dog hair , flip flops from beach waste collected by volunteers , recycled wine corks into men 's brogues , @entity46 glass slippers and they have 3d - printed a shoe from recycled office paper			1
designer @entity12 shows the one - inch - long baby booties she has co-created with @entity11 , using donated breast milk at the @entity14 in @entity15 , to promote @entity24 the pair - described as ' masters of material manipulation ' - have worked with brands including @entity53 and @entity54 , and are currently working on producing a trainer using chip fat			1
of their breast milk project , mr @entity11 said : ' the aim is to highlight the importance of breast milk donation , and more broadly to challenge people 's perceptions about so - called waste products			1
' we want to show that they can be used to raise awareness and communicate issues about material culture , ethics and sustainability			2
' turning waste material like breast milk which could n't otherwise be used , but which is embedded with meaning and personal history , into something new , gives the products created greater meaning and value			2
' @entity12 and @entity11 have created other upcycled footwear , including children 's slippers made from dog hair and flip flops made from plastic found on the beach the process to create the booties was relatively simple			1
it involved gently heating some breast milk , then adding some vinegar to help form a congealed curd cluster , similar to mozzarella			2
it was then pressed into silicon moulds and dried over the course of four days			2
also in their repertoire are men 's brogues made from cork there are plans for five more pairs of booties to be made			1
the first pair will be presented to a donor to mark @entity24			2
mr @entity11 and ms @entity12 worked with @entity108 , manager of the milk bank at @entity111 's and @entity112 in @entity113 , and chairwoman of the @entity9 @entity116 's national forum			1
the milk bank , run by @entity118 , provides specially heat - treated breast milk collected from volunteer donor mothers for use in feeding sick and premature babies			2
ms @entity108 said : ' seeing these tiny booties made from breast milk is a unique reminder of the valuable role that breast milk plays in helping premature babies to survive and grow			1
' along with breast milk booties , left , @entity11 and @entity12 have made slippers from dog hair , right the pair have also created sustainable flip flops from plastic found on the beach and in the ocean which they turned into thread jewellery made from breast milk proved an unlikely hit among new mothers in april			1
@entity143 is just one of several stores on craft site @entity147 to plasticize breast milk samples so that it can be transformed into wearable keepsakes such as pendants and bracelets			2
@entity152 from @entity153 in @entity154 , who runs the online store , instructs buyers to send two tablespoons of their milk in a zip - lock bag , so that she can preserve it in resin			2
parenting trend : @entity143 is just one of several stores on @entity147 , which uses breast milk to create wearable keepsakes such as pendants , lucky charms and bracelets the mother - of - three told @entity170 that she can ' barely keep up ' with orders and the response has been ' overwhelming '			2
customers tell her that the jewelry ' is a gorgeous reminder of such a special time ' and a great way of commemorating ' the bonding experience you had with your child			0
' on receiving a breast milk sample , ms @entity152 ' plasticizes ' it , then molds it into miniature shapes such as hearts , moons , stars or tiny feet and hands			0
the ' milk bead ' is then set in clear resin and silver hooks and chains are added			0
the child 's name or a special message can also be included			0
personalization : mothers can choose to have their child 's name added alongside the ' bead ' of breast milk ms @entity152 warns that the color of the finished piece will vary depending on the sample of milk and no two pieces are ever the same			0
' some milk is more yellow than others , other milk is very thin and will create a less bright bead , if you will , ' she writes on her website			0
' there may be some areas in your breast milk bead that appear slightly darker or whiter than the rest of the bead			0
this is because milk has fatty and non-fatty parts			0
' for the most part your bead will look like a uniform color but under very close inspection you may see the slight color variations or speckles			0
' a restaurant in @entity113 sold breast milk ice cream to customers in a cocktail glass in 2011			1
@entity233 , based in @entity234 , named the Â£ 14 dish @entity236 ... until @entity237 launched a lawsuit against them			0
@entity239 , 35 , from @entity240 provided the first 30 fluid ounces of milk which was enough to make the first 50 servings			0
the recipe blended breast milk with @entity247 vanilla pods and lemon zest			0
a costumed @entity236 waitress served the ice cream in a martini glass filled with the breast milk ice cream mix. liquid nitrogen was then poured into the glass through a syringe and it is served with a rusk			1
martini glass : @entity239 , 35 , has provided her breast milk although the restaurant are looking for more donors bizarre : @entity262 founder @entity261 , 44 , and the @entity237 waitress in the central @entity113 store ms @entity239 added : ' it was n't intrusive at all to donate - just a simple blood test			1
what could be more natural than fresh , free - range mothers milk in an ice cream ? ' @entity270 works with women who have problems breast feeding their babies			0
she said she believes that if adults realise how tasty breast milk actually is , new mothers will be more willing to breast feed their own newborns			0
' you can kid yourself that its a healthy ice cream ! ' said @entity270			0
donor : @entity239 , 25 , provided 30 fluid ounces - enough to make the first 50 servings ' but it is very nice it really melts in the mouth			0
i teach women how to get started on breast feeding their babies			0
