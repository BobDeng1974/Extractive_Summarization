by @entity1 reporter published : 11:27 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:22 est , 25 february 2014 as marijuana for medical and recreational uses continues to gain broader acceptance throughout @entity8 , health officials are worried that the drug 's widespread acceptance is leading to an increase in traffic fatalities			2
researchers at @entity15 's @entity14 say that as marijuana use has become more widely accepted , fatal crashes involving the drug have tripled			1
' currently , one of nine drivers involved in fatal crashes would test positive for marijuana , ' dr. @entity22 , director of the @entity23 and @entity24 at @entity15 and a co-author of the study			1
' if this trend continues , in five or six years non-alcohol drugs will overtake alcohol to become the most common substance involved in deaths related to impaired driving			2
' acceptance : as more people begin to accept marijuana use , experts worry there will be more fatal car wrecks the study analyzed statistics from nearly 24,000 drivers who were killed in auto accidents between 1999 and 2010 and who died within an hour of the crash			1
researchers looked at the toxicology reports of victims of these types of crashes in six states : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			2
the study found that alcohol - related deaths from traffic accidents stayed consistent at about 40 percent throughout the decade , drug - related traffic fatalities jumped from 16 percent in 1999 to 28 percent by 2010			1
in the drug - related fatalities , 12 percent of the 2010 crashes involved marijuana			1
in 1999 , only four percent of traffic fatalities involved marijuana			1
legal : marijuana for recreational use has been approved in both @entity68 and @entity69 the study acknowledges that just because traces of marijuana are found in a victim 's blood it does n't necessarily mean that person was impaired at the time of the wreck			1
' the prevalence of nonalcohol drugs reported in this study should be interpreted as an indicator of drug use , not necessarily a measurement of drug impairment , ' the authors of the study note			0
the study also reveals that a combination of alcohol and marijuana increases a driver 's risk of dying in a fatal crash			0
' if a driver is under the influence of alcohol , their risk of a fatal crash is 13 times higher than the risk of the driver who is not under the influence of alcohol , ' @entity22 said			0
' but if the driver is under the influence of both alcohol and marijuana , their risk increases to 24 times that of a sober person			0
' highway safety officials argue that as marijuana use becomes accepted even further , there could be an even further influx of drug - related traffic fatalities			1
@entity117 : @entity117 president @entity118 echoes researcher 's concerns that marijuana acceptance could lead to more deadly wrecks ' the legalization of pot is going to spread to other states			2
it 's not even a partisan issue at this point			0
our expectation is this will become the norm rather than the rarity , ' deputy executive director of the @entity130 , @entity131 , told @entity136			0
@entity118 , the national president of @entity117 , has similar concerns			0
' this study shows an alarming increase in driving under the influence of drugs and , in particular , it shows an increase in driving under the influence of both alcohol and drugs , ' @entity118 said in a statement			0
' when it comes to drugged driving versus drunk driving , the substances may be different but the consequences are the same -- needless deaths and injuries			0

12 percent of the fatal , drug - related crashes in 2010 crashes involved marijuana
in 1999 , only four percent of fatal wrecks involved marijuana
@entity68 and @entity69 have legalized marijuana while many others approve of the drug for *medicinal* use
experts worry that as more states allow marijuana use , the more fatal wrecks there will be
