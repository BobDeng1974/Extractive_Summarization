by @entity1 medical correspondent thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer are to receive a new drug after a double u-turn by the @entity7 rationing body			1
@entity8 extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options - with some surviving more than 18 months			1
it was initially recommended by the @entity13 for @entity7 funding without curbs last october			2
thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer are to receive a new drug after a double u-turn by the @entity7 rationing body @entity13 but then @entity13 issued revised draft guidance in january proposing restrictions affecting the vast majority of men with prostate cancer that has spread			1
it would have been banned for men in @entity24 and @entity25 previously treated with another new drug abiraterone - while men in @entity28 can get both drugs			0
cancer specialists were outraged , saying it was a perverse u-turn based on fears about the cost but using a technicality to argue there was insufficient evidence to allow the drug to be used			2
the outcry over the plan led to @entity41 @entity40 spearheading a campaign , with more than 13,500 people signing its petition alongside widespread support from high profile figures such as sir @entity47 and other organisations such as tackle @entity41			1
@entity13 has now performed another u-turn in final draft guidance ( to subs must retain ) , which seems to go back to its original position of recommending enzalutamide regardless of a patient ’s previous treatment			2
doctors say enzalutamide could help turn prostate cancer from a killer disease into a chronic illness by combining new and older agents together for longer survival			2
around 10,500 @entity40 men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments			1
trials show men taking enzalutamide survived for more than 18 months , with almost half having a better quality of life as a result , compared with 13.6 months for men receiving a placebo ( dummy treatment )			2
the drug @entity8 extends life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options for prostate cancer professor @entity79 , centre for health technology evaluation director at @entity13 , acknowledged that clinicians and patients were among those protesting over the proposed changes			1
she said ‘ during consultation on the draft recommendations for using enzalutamide , we received a number of responses , including data and comments from the manufacturer of the drug , professional organisations and patient groups			0
‘ due to this additional information we now know that , at the moment , evidence on the effectiveness of enzalutamide when given after abiraterone is too uncertain to make a definitive evidence - based recommendation , so we have not done so			0
‘ we continue to recommend enzalutamide as a treatment for patients whose cancer has progressed after previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy			0
’ professor @entity109 , chief executive of @entity110 , @entity111 , said : ‘ we are very pleased that @entity13 has listened to the concerns we and others have raised , and dropped a controversial restriction on the use of enzalutamide from its draft guidance			0
‘ this restriction would have prevented men with advanced prostate cancer from accessing enzalutamide after receiving another life - extending drug , abiraterone , which was discovered and developed here at @entity110			1
‘ this change will have an important effect on thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer by allowing them to access both abiraterone and enzalutamide after receiving chemotherapy , and therefore giving them several more precious months of life			1
’ @entity129 , chief executive at @entity41 @entity40 , said the charity cautiously welcomed the change of heart , but wanted assurances men who needed it would get the drug			1
he said ‘ we are pleased that overall enzalutamide has been approved in @entity24 and @entity25 and that the long contested blanket restriction around use after abiraterone has been lifted			0
‘ however we are not currently clear as to what this ruling will truly mean in reality for the men across the country who have exhausted all other options and are grappling with the final stages of this cruel disease			0
‘ the bottom line is , will these men be given the potential of extra time with their loved ones or not ? ‘ we strongly expect that after eight long months of dithering @entity13 has done the right thing , and that men across @entity24 and @entity25 can access this vital drug now			1
‘ the priority is doing the right thing by those who are standing on the edge of the abyss today and we need to be sure that they are going to start being prescribed the treatment before we confirm our course of action			0
‘ if it transpires in reality that this is a de facto restriction thinly veiled by complex prose , we will be holding relevant parties to account and will continue our fight to ensure men are not denied enzalutamide after abiraterone			0
’ the drug , which is a pill taken at home , costs around £ 25,000 for an average course of treatment			0
but the manufacturer @entity175 has reduced the price through a patient access scheme which makes it cost effective , according to @entity13			0
a key trial of the drug , also known as @entity8 , was carried out by researchers at the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) and the @entity181 , @entity111			0
@entity182 , chairman of prostate cancer charity tackle , said ‘ finally this drug is available to improve and prolong life for those who have been anxiously waiting for several months			1
