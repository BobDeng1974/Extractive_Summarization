by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 1 april 2013 an elected police commissioner will not prioritise low - level drug users because it will take up too much of her officers ’ time			1
former @entity6 minister @entity5 , who is in charge of the @entity9 police force , has ignored drug use in her new policing plan			1
her office has justified the move on the grounds that combating low - level drug use would mean taking officers off the streets			0
no prio : police commissioner @entity5 said her officers will not focus on low - level drugs as it takes up too much of their time the plan has led to claims that the former solicitor general , who is in charge of the force for five years , is ignoring ‘ significant concerns ’ among local people			1
and it flies in the face of the views expressed by @entity33 ’s most senior policeman , sir @entity32 , who earlier this year said he supported ‘ robust ’ policing of drug use			0
the @entity37 commissioner even suggested that thousands of workers should be routinely tested for illegal substances as part of measures to reduce demand			0
at a meeting of the local police and crime panel , mrs @entity5 ’s deputy , @entity43 , was asked why the policing plan made no mention of drugs , or set a drug - dealing reduction target			1
@entity51 : ms @entity5 's deputy @entity43 , right , defended the policy in front of councillors recently ex minister who refused to clean up after her dog he replied : ‘ we did not put drugs in the plan in terms of priorities because that is the best way to use our resources			1
‘ drugs is an issue and will continue to be something we tackle at the highest level , but the vast majority of our drug seizures are people who are brought into the station for a different reason and have drugs on them when we search them			0
‘ if i put drugs in the plan , there is a danger that beat police officers will not be on the streets in your neighbourhoods			2
’ but @entity81 leader @entity80 said : ‘ we need to maintain a strong presence on the streets for our police but i am really concerned about the impact of drugs on our communities and i know there are significant concerns from residents particularly about the drug use in parts of the city			2
‘ it is important to me that people involved in peddling drugs know that they will face the full force of the law for their actions			0
’ a spokesman at mrs @entity5 ’s office later claimed : ‘ to keep this in context , drug crime was not mentioned as a priority by the public in any of the consultation undertaken , including in @entity81			1
’ but the policing plan makes clear that in a public consultation survey , ‘ alcohol and drug - related crimes ’ came second among the public in terms of their concerns , and was mentioned by one in five respondents			2
and mrs @entity5 herself cited drugs as an issue when criticising council cuts to youth services last year , warning that ‘ drug crime is on the increase ’			1
the document lists five priorities : putting victims first ; reducing crime ; dealing with anti-social behaviour ; tackling domestic and sexual abuse ; building community confidence			0
on drugs , it says police will deal with major organised crime , including dealers			0
it states : ‘ the police will focus relentlessly on those involved in organised crime causing the most harm in our communities , in particular those involved in the supply of drugs			0
’ last night , @entity141 , the former detective who ran as the conservative candidate for the commissioner post , said : ‘ although i recognise that highlighting one issue such as drugs in a policing plan can divert resources , it should not be forgotten that drugs are crime ’s money - maker			2

@entity5 will not target drug use as @entity9 's police commissioner
councillors speak out against plan and *insist* drug trade must be stopped
