by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 ten years ago at the precocious age of 13 @entity3 was first picked for @entity5 ’s senior golf team and a suitable playing partner was sought for him			1
that turned out to be fellow @entity9 lad @entity8 , five years his senior , and on thursday afternoon — playing within three groups of each other — they will line up for the first time in the starting field of @entity17			1
with @entity20 factory worker @entity19 , the 30 - year - old @entity22 figure at this year ’s event , they make up a three - strong @entity25 contingent at @entity26			1
and with due respect to golf ’s finest forklift truck driver , the two younger men are much more likely to play in future opens			1
local boy : @entity3 will tee off at the 143rd @entity17 for the first time at @entity34 inside knowledge : @entity3 has played royal @entity36 a lot as an amateur @entity3 , now 23 , recalls his shyness when he first met @entity8 : ‘ we were playing against @entity44 ’s @entity43 squad ( the women ’s amateur team ) in a practice match			1
basically , i was thrown in			0
’ thursday is another debut for @entity50 , reckoned to be a seriously good prospect , and again he is glad to have a local connection as he tackles his first major			1
‘ i ’ve played royal @entity36 a lot as an amateur so i know the course well , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the only problem is that i do n’t have a clue which hole i ’m on because they ’ve changed the numbers			0
’ @entity26 alters its sequence for @entity17 so the usual 17th and 18th holes become the first and second , allowing the par - five 16th to become the dramatic closing hole			2
@entity9 might be thinly populated , given the numbers heading down to the @entity20 to support its two most prominent golfers			0
scouse proud : @entity25 's @entity8 will bring the crowds from @entity36 familiar faces : @entity8 partnered a young @entity3 10 years ago the local football club may have long since lost its @entity72 status but @entity9 is a golfing hotbed boasting many top - class courses			1
‘ it ’s not called @entity81 ’s golf coast for nothing , ’ said @entity8 , whose grandfather @entity75 played rugby league for @entity44 , and in the @entity78 final for @entity79			2
‘ we ’ve got @entity84 , @entity9 and @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 is not far away — all top courses			0
i should mention @entity90 too , because i grew up in a house behind the 17th green and that ’s where i learned to play			0
‘ i would n’t say we push each other			0
@entity96 is younger — he ’s a proper talent and self - driven			0
we ’ve played a lot here , so there ’s no reason we ca n’t do well			0
’ and @entity50 believes they will not be the last locals to make the grade			2
‘ there are quite a few juniors about where we ’re from and some of them are good , ’ he said			0
‘ it ca n’t do any harm to have two of us playing at @entity17			2
’ against the odds : forklift truck driver @entity19 is a 1000 - 1 shot to win @entity17 do the write thing : @entity19 signs autographs for spectators during his practice round both men will have friends and family in the gallery but they are unlikely to have as much support as 1000 - 1 shot @entity19 , who works a few miles away in @entity121 for @entity122 and came through qualifying at @entity86			1
the factory employs 25 people and half will be given the day off today to watch and half tomorrow — all hoping their colleague makes the cut and is still around at the weekend			1
@entity19 — who spends his working day driving the forklifts and mixing resin — had planned to volunteer as a @entity26 marshal			1
instead , he tees off this morning with @entity135 @entity134 and @entity137 ’s @entity136			0
depending on the next few days , @entity19 may consider giving professional golf another go , having once tried via the @entity135 college system			2
‘ i ’ve got nothing to lose , ’ he said			0
‘ no - one expects anything from me , so i ’m just going to enjoy myself			0

@entity36 men @entity3 , @entity8 and @entity19 will play at 143rd @entity17 at the @entity36 , @entity147
@entity8 and @entity50 partnered each other 10 years ago against the @entity43 squad in a practice match
@entity19 is a forklift truck driver by trade and his factory co-worker have been given the day off to watch him
