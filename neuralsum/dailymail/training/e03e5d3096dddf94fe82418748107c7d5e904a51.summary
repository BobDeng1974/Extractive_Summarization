women aged 40 and over are spending more money than ever on risque lingerie and erotic accessories , say sales statistics from lingerie companies			1
they 're spending a small fortune on lingerie and sex toys - more than double the amount women in their 20s spend , according to lingerie and erotic accessory boutique @entity13			1
over the last three months , the company has seen a 50 per cent rise in customers over 40 years old			2
women in their forties have the highest sex drive - and in turn are investing most in risque lingerie women over 40 are the ones buying the sexier , more risqué pieces of underwear , as well as a variety of toys , sex games and role playing pieces			2
major research says that women approaching 40 have higher libidos than girls in their 20s when asked , women credited erotic novels such as @entity37 and books by @entity39 and @entity40 for their increased sexual appetite			1
customers in their 20s spend , on average , 15 minutes in store while those in their 40s spend a more leisurely one hour			1
the findings suggest that the younger customers know what items they want before entering the store and favour a quick transaction			2
but older customers are more willing to spend time trying on lingerie and learning about the latest sex toys and accessories before making purchases			0
customers in their 20s spend on average £ 150 on lingerie while those above 40 years old spend in excess of £ 500			1
of course , these findings can be partially explained by the fact that older age groups may have more disposable income than people in their 20s			0
however , there has also been a 75 per cent rise in women over 40 bringing their partners along to lingerie appointments , suggesting older couples are more forthcoming and honest with each other about what it is they like in the bedroom			0
@entity13 sees an average of 10 couples a week visiting the store together to purchase pieces for the bedroom			0
in the last two months there has been a 200 per cent rise in women purchasing corsets			0
the boutique has also seen a 40 per cent rise in male customers over the last two months			0
the most popular items bought by men are silk stockings , suspenders and negligees for their lover			0
leading @entity93 erotic boutique @entity94 report a similar customer base to @entity96			2
they report that 45 - 54 is the second biggest customer group , but both the 45 - 54 age bracket and the 65 - plus group spend considerably more than the 18 - 24 - year - olds			1
women over 40 mostly brave the downstairs turquoise boudoir where naughtier items are kept online , an average man of that age will spend considerably more but he will also browse for much longer and save pieces in his basket which he never ends up buying			1
women of the age may spend less but they know exactly what they want , find it without browsing and buy			1
this reflects that older women know what they want and are enjoying erotica			0
the findings reflect new major research from sex toy firm @entity122 , who report that women approaching 40 have higher libidos than girls in their 20s			1
they polled 2,100 men and women ranging in age from 18 to over 65 to find out how happy people are with their sex lives , how often they have sex and how libido is affected by age			1
it found that women with the highest sex drives are aged between 35 and 44			0
more than a third of women ( 36 per cent ) in the same age group are having sex two to three times a week and fifth ( 20 per cent ) four to six times a week			2
more than three - quarters of women in this age group are satisfied with their sex lives			2
one factor in the high levels of sexual satisfaction in middle - aged women is - again - erotic books such as @entity37			0
of those who have read the book , 47 per cent say that it has actively influenced their sex lives .			0
