insider insists bank bosses must have known about @entity2 fixing in 2008 hearing : former chief executive @entity3 left @entity4 over the matter , before appearing before mps this week a former senior employee of @entity4 has spoken out about a ' culture of fear ' that existed at the bank - and alleged that it is ' impossible ' that bosses did not know about the interest rate rigging taking place on their watch			1
the banker claims disgraced ex-chief executive @entity3 would have been aware that his traders were involved in @entity2 fiddling in 2008			1
mr @entity3 maintains that he knew nothing about the rate fixing and told mps this week that he only heard about it last month			1
today 's revelations follow demands from furious shareholders that the bank strips its former boss of his entitlement to an £ 18million bonus , while the @entity27 yesterday confirmed it is pursuing criminal investigations into the industry - wide conspiracy			1
the banker , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told the @entity34 that @entity4 executives must have been told about irregularities in @entity2 - a key lending rate - because staff knew they would be sacked if they did not report any such concerns to their managers			1
this goes against mr @entity3 's insistence that signs of distorted @entity2 figures were not reported up			1
during mr @entity3 's reign , the banker said , @entity4 was run through management by intimidation , and some employees felt it necessary to work 15 - hour days due to a brutal appraisals system that left them in constant fear for their jobs			1
the insider account laid blame on the former chief , saying : ' @entity3 was the ceo and his policies come down through the executive committee , and then mds and directors push that down through the firm			2
all of this stuff ultimately comes from the top			0
' this climate of fear and fierce competition was encouraged by directors , the former employee claimed , and those who complained or appeared to crack under the pressure would be ' demoralised ' and slowly ' managed out ' of the company			0
the unnamed insider also raised the question of whether @entity18 could have been more rigorous in their questioning of mr @entity3 when he appeared before a @entity75 on wednesday			2
a @entity4 spokesman responded by pointing out that @entity77 , head of the investment banking division , had led a probe into rate - rigging and passed on his findings to the board			2
meanwhile , the @entity27 's own inquiry has been launched after it was put off last year because of lack of funding ; its budget has been cut by 38 per cent over five years			1
it has been sharing information with the @entity88 from its investigation into @entity4 and other banks thought to be caught up in rate - rigging			1
leading @entity93 investors say mr @entity3 , who quit this week over the scandal , should not receive a penny			0
under fire : @entity4 former chairman @entity97 ( right ) with former ceo @entity3 ( centre ) , and former chief executive @entity99 ( left ) @entity100 , chief executive of the @entity101 – one of the most powerful shareholder groups in the country – said : ‘ shareholders , including pension funds , have been negatively affected by their investments in @entity4			0
‘ this whole issue has been deeply damaging and raises questions about previous pay which now need answers			0
any severance payments to top staff must be kept to a contractual minimum			0
’ mr @entity3 has pocketed more than £ 120million from @entity4 since 2007 , while pension savers and shareholders – including 719,000 small private investors – have seen the value of their holdings plunge			0
@entity4 is under pressure to claw back the potential £ 18million payout to mr @entity3 , who quit on wednesday after the bank was fined £ 290million because corrupt traders had made huge profits by secretly manipulating @entity2 figures			1
as the @entity27 prepares its investigation , @entity127 leader @entity126 continued to push for an independent inquiry into the banking scandal despite mps rejecting the demands			1
the @entity127 leader said that while the party would cooperate with a parliamentary investigation , its remit was too " narrow " and a judge - led probe was still needed			1
mr @entity126 also defended the conduct of @entity141 after the shadow chancellor engaged in a bitter war of words with his opposite number @entity145 in the @entity147			0
it followed an interview with the spectator where mr @entity145 said former prime minister @entity152 's inner circle had ' questions to answer ' over apparent pressure on @entity4 to post lower libor rates during the credit crunch			0
backing : @entity126 ( left ) has defended @entity141 ( right ) after he engaged in a bitter war of words with his opposite number @entity145 in the commons @entity162 deputy governor @entity161 and @entity4 chairman @entity97 , who announced his intention to resign after a replacement for mr @entity3 is found , will give evidence on the rate - rigging scandal to the @entity75 next week			2
mr @entity161 was dragged into the affair by mr @entity3 , who revealed a record of a conversation they had in october 2008 in which the deputy governor relayed concerns in @entity172 about @entity4 ' high libor rates			2
the @entity175 banker said mr @entity161 was trying to warn him that " there are ministers in @entity172 who are hearing that @entity4 is always high , that could lead to the impression that you are not funding yourself "			0
@entity4 was dealt another blow yesterday as agencies @entity182 's downgraded their outlook for the bank 's credit rating in the wake of mr @entity3 's departure			2
the agencies said the departure of mr @entity3 , as well as mr @entity97 and chief operating officer @entity191 , could lead to the break - up of its powerhouse investment arm			2
appearing before the @entity75 earlier this week , mr @entity3 was savaged by some mps			0
@entity127 mp @entity195 said mr @entity3 had been either ‘ complicit in what was going on , or grossly negligent , or grossly incompetent ’			0
but the former boss said he had been ‘ physically ill ’ when he learned of the behaviour of traders who rigged the @entity2 rates , had known nothing about it before last month , and did not feel personally to blame			1
mr @entity3 said emails showing that traders fiddling the rates had told each other ‘ this is for you big boy ’ and promised bottles of @entity207 had been ‘ reprehensible ’			0
but he suggested other banks had been manipulating their rates while @entity4 was telling the truth at the height of the financial crisis			0
@entity4 has been fined £ 290million by regulators after its traders were revealed to have spent years fiddling the rate , based on individual banks ’ own declarations of what they were paying to borrow			0
mr @entity3 faced the most intense questioning from @entity18 over a key phone conversation he had with the deputy governor of the bank of england @entity161 in 2008			1
he refused to speculate about the identity of ‘ senior @entity172 figures ’ he said mr @entity161 told him had been concerned about @entity4 ’ @entity2 rate			1
however , he did suggest that @entity228 , a cabinet office minister who was a senior economic adviser to @entity152 , had been heavily involved in discussions with the banks at the time .			0
