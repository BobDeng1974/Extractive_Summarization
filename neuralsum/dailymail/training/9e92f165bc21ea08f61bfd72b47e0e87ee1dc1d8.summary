by @entity0 a toddler who suffered a fatal wound to the head was unlawfully killed , a coroner has concluded , despite no - one being charged over her death			1
an inquest into the death of @entity8 , who was 21 months old when she died , heard she was subjected to a non-accidental ' blunt force trauma '			1
police arrested @entity8 â€™s mother @entity11 , 27 , stepfather @entity12 , 34 , and grandmother @entity13 , 58 , on suspicion of murder after her death because all three had cared for the toddler during the period when experts said she must have been hit			1
tragic : @entity18 was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in february 2012			1
but two - and - a - half years later , no one has been charged with her death family : the court heard @entity8 , pictured with mother @entity11 , came from a loving family who had no contact with social services			0
but a coroner has now ruled she was ' unlawfully killed ' the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) decided no - one could be prosecuted over her death because it could not be established whether it was her mother , stepfather or maternal grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured			1
at the end of an inquest today , assistant deputy coroner @entity33 said the non-accidental nature of the injury had been established not merely on the ' balance of probabilities ' , but also ' beyond reasonable doubt ' , as is necessary to secure a conviction in the criminal courts			0
he said : ' in my view , and to the criminal standard of proof , i am satisfied that whatever the state of mind of the perpetrator of the act that caused @entity8 's ultimately fatal injury , it would have been obvious to that perpetrator that @entity8 was being subjected to forces far in excess of anything she might have been expected to withstand , and which were overwhelmingly likely to cause her very significant injury			0
' i accordingly will record a conclusion that @entity8 was unlawfully killed			2
' detective constable @entity58 had told the inquest in @entity60 that @entity8 's mother , @entity11 , had been arrested on suspicion of murder during the investigation into her daughter 's death , along with her grandmother @entity13 and her mother 's partner @entity12			2
mystery : @entity8 's mother @entity11 ( right ) was arrested on suspicion of murder after medical records showed the toddler 's injuries could not have been inflicted by accident but was later released without charge confusion : her stepfather @entity77 ( pictured with @entity78 ) and her maternal grandmother were also arrested and then released because the @entity29 could not determine who had been looking after the 21 - month - old he said @entity81 submitted a file to the @entity29 but there was no prosecution			1
the detective said this was because all three of those arrested had looked after @entity8 at her home in @entity89 , @entity90 at some time in the early morning of february 27 , 2012 , but pathologists were unable to pin - point exactly when the injuries were sustained			2
mr @entity33 also concluded there was no evidence @entity8 had been subjected to regular neglect or abuse			0
he said : ' the childcare arrangements that were in place for her meant that she was regularly cared for in three distinct family environments , in each of which it appears to me she was lovingly and appropriately looked after			0
' the event that led to her death was , i find , an extraordinary and horrific one - off event that could not have been predicted			0
' the court was told how @entity8 was a normal , healthy child in a family with no involvement with social services			0

@entity8 died of a blunt force injury to the head in 2012
@entity121 , stepfather and grandmother all arrested on suspicion of murder
charges not *brought* as it was ' not clear who was caring for *summer* at time '
