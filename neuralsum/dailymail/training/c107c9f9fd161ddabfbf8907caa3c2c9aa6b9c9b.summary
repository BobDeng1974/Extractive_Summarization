a fearless teenager has snapped these vertigo - inducing pictures while dangling 700ft in the air from some of @entity5 ’s tallest skyscrapers			1
@entity6 , 17 , from @entity7 was able to dodge security to scale the likes of the ‘ @entity10 ’ , the ‘ @entity11 ’ and the unfinished @entity12			1
the adrenaline junkie and his friends , who do not use safety equipment or harnesses , treat the scaffolds surrounding multimillion pound towers as their own urban climbing frames			1
last month mr @entity6 , who is also a free - runner , mounted a crane taller than the under - construction @entity38 at the @entity40 , which will be almost 500ft when it is completed			1
he said : ‘ we ’d been planning it for weeks , every little detail like what time we should arrive - we ended up at the bottom of the crane at 4am			0
‘ there was security there but i was still surprised how easy it was			2
his legs can be seen dangling as he sits on top of a huge crane overlooking @entity5 to capture a series of photographs			1
he is part of group known as @entity31 @entity6 pictured on top of @entity58 beside the shard , which stands at almost 1000ft and is currently the tallest building in the @entity62 ‘ the view was amazing			1
we could see all of @entity24 and all over the rest of @entity5			1
we stayed up there for three hours but i wanted to spend the rest of the summer there			0
’ his death - defying stunts are similar to the ‘ skywalkers ’ of @entity71 and @entity72 who hang from the edges of buildings , but the retail assistant insists he is more interested in taking photographs			2
he added : ‘ for skywalkers it ’s about the risk , to climb towers and balance			2
we go up to enjoy the experience and to take photos			2
‘ as far as hobbies go , it ’s just as dangerous as other extreme sports like motor sports , skiing or snowboarding			0
‘ i feel perfectly safe whenever i climb because i ’ve been training for a long time			2
i have been free running for seven years and i think that has given me strength and , importantly , balance			0
@entity6 and his friends observe the @entity5 skyline after scaling a huge building that over looks the ' @entity10 ' ( left ) and @entity98 ( right ) the group have been able to evade security and without any safety equipment climb massive towers in order to capture these breath - taking images of the capital ‘ when i am at the top , i ’m constantly making sure my hands have got a tight grip			1
i do n’t move until i know i am secure			0
’ mr @entity6 , who also favours extinct rail lines and disused reservoirs for climbs , explained the last thing to do is to think about slipping and plummeting whilst hundreds of feet above the ground			1
he said : ‘ i understand that i might not be setting the best example			0
‘ my theory is that if i can do it at 10ft i can do it at 100ft or 40 stories			0
but i would be lying if i said i do n’t think about falling			0
but if you think you will fall , you will fall			0
the key is to think positive			0
’ despite evading security in dozens of cases , not all climbs have been successful as he discovered after his first and only run in with police while climbing the frame of plush new apartments in @entity127 , south @entity5			1
one of harry 's friends lies inside the cab of a crane as it overlooks @entity5			1
they were arrested six months ago for attempting to climb apartments in @entity127 his friend @entity22 is seen at the end of a crane snapping photographs overlooking @entity24 on a bleak misty morning in the capital			1
@entity6 says his mother refuses to look at the images they capture and is ' not happy ' about his high - climbing hobby he explained : ‘ we were arrested about six months ago - within about 30 minutes of starting the climb we were in the back of a police car			1
‘ there were cars , a helicopter and police dogs looking for us			0
‘ luckily on that occasion the charges were dropped			0
i found if you respect the police , they respect you			0
’ mr @entity6 and his friends have seen security being tightened up in recent times but he says he is n't worried about getting caught again			1
' if i 'm doing it to capture pictures and not to be destructive i think the police can understand			2
' but the teenager ’s toughest challenge has been convincing his mother to look at his impressive portfolio of photographs			1
he said : ‘ my mum knows what i ’m doing			0
it was almost impossible for her not to find out because i was out all night			0
‘ but she does n’t want to hear about it			2
i ca n’t say she is happy about it and she does n’t want to see any of the photos			2
’ @entity6 stands on a narrow bar of a crane to take this vertigo - inducing image			1
he has been free running - or leaping from tall buildings - for seven years			0
