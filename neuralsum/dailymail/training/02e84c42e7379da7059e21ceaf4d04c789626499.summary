by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 3 june 2013 a huge rise in expectant mothers who are ' too posh to push ' is costing millions and putting pressure on the health service , it has been warned around one in four women in the @entity8 now has their baby by caesarean – putting enormous pressure on the @entity11 , doctors claim			1
the rate has shot up to around 25 per cent in the last two decades , while in private hospitals it is around double that			0
in 1990 just 11 per cent of babies were delivered surgically			0
recent figures show one in three caesarean sections carried out in the @entity8 is requested by the mother , compared to one in 20 in 1990 , dr @entity20 , lead clinician for obstetric anaesthesia , @entity23 , @entity24 , claims			1
in private hospitals half of all @entity26 are carried out at the mother ’s request			0
out of the 700,000 births that take place in the @entity8 every year , between 25 and 30 per cent are caesarean sections , almost double the 15 per cent recommended by the @entity32 , she added			2
each @entity26 costs the @entity11 £ 1,000 more than a regular delivery and a group of experts speaking at @entity37 , the annual congress of the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , claim that even a small reduction in the number of babies delivered using the procedure will result in a large reduction in costs and free up medical specialists to help with emergency procedures			1
dr @entity20 voiced her concern for the added burden the increase is placing on an already stretched @entity11			0
‘ the increased caesarean section rate is putting anaesthesia , obstetric , and midwife teams under much greater strain at a time when there are increasingly reduced resources across healthcare systems , ’ she said			1
there is a greater risk of death for women who have to undergo emergency caesarean sections , which account for two thirds of all caesarean sections in the @entity8			2
according to dr @entity20 , reducing the number of planned caesarean sections would allow doctors and nurses , especially anaesthesia specialists , to dedicate more of their time to women and their babies who are at risk of serious complications			1
she said : ‘ women who require an emergency caesarean section during labour , but who have already had an epidural catheter sited during the labour , are in a good position to receive emergency anaesthesia for caesarean section , since stronger drugs can be injected down the epidural			2
‘ the use of these drugs , which are essentially stronger solutions of the drugs used for pain relief in labour , means that the mother can be ready for her emergency surgery within 10 - 12 minutes of the anaesthetist being informed that emergency delivery is required			0
out of the 700,000 births that take place in the @entity8 every year , between 25 and 30 per cent are caesarean sections , almost double the 15 per cent recommended by the @entity32 ‘ other countries in @entity101 are experiencing similar issues to varying degrees and we need to ask why this is happening , ’ said dr @entity20			0
she explained : ‘ reasons could include better intra-partum fetal monitoring , fears of medico - legal claims , and , maternal demand			0
‘ whatever the cause for the rise in the @entity26 rate , it is likely that , in the near future , performance indicators will be devised for hospitals to help explain / evaluate that hospital 's caesarean section rate			0
‘ there is also a knock - on effect for future pregnancies , since once a woman has undergone one caesarean section , she is then at greater risk of having an emergency @entity26 in the next pregnancy , though in most cases she would demand another elective @entity26 anyway			1
‘ even for those women who have chosen vaginal birth following a previous caesarean section , around half will end up having a caesarean section			1

one in four mothers having caesareans is putting pressure on @entity11
in 1990 only one in 20 caesarean sections were requested by the woman
each caesarean section costs the @entity11 £ 1,000 more than a *natural* birth
experts say cutting number of elective operations would allow doctors to deal with emergencies more *rapidly*
