@entity0 will not attempt to cash in on any of their first four blank @entity1 weeks following discussions between manager @entity3 and executive vice-chairman @entity4			1
@entity5 has asked for and received a 10 - week amnesty in which he can train with his players without the distractions of money - spinning friendlies to make up the financial shortfall caused by @entity0 ’s failure to qualify for @entity12			1
after that the 62 - year - old @entity13 has agreed to sit down with @entity4 again to assess the situation			2
@entity15 : @entity3 has been promised 10 weeks with his players to train them up to his tactics demands : @entity5 ( right ) wants time to get his squad to adapt to his tactical ideas across to his squad the @entity13 said : ‘ i need preparation of 10 weeks and i am lucky @entity0 are not playing in a @entity23 competition to do this , ’ he said			1
‘ we have discussed the issue of friendly matches and for the first 10 weeks , we have to train			0
after that it is different and we will wait to see if we have a chance to play some matches			0
‘ it will also depends on the opponent			0
it has to be a good opponent like this tournament in @entity35			0
’ the compromise with @entity37 has been reached after @entity3 complained that @entity0 ’s current 13,500 - mile pre-season tour of @entity35 had hampered his plans			2
to stress his displeasure , he said : ‘ @entity0 shall do everything to adapt to my rules for good preparation			0
’ the @entity13 has spent his first fortnight in the @entity35 working on tactical issues with his players and will do the bulk of the fitness work when they return to @entity49 this week			2
money : @entity0 will miss out on playing lucrative friendlies until at least december at @entity5 's request but he has now won a guarantee from @entity37 that the club will not seek friendly games , in which they could earn several million pounds per game , when other clubs are playing @entity1 fixtures in september , october and early - november			1
however , it does raise the prospect of @entity0 jetting abroad in december when the final group games are played in the @entity1 or when the competition returns at the knockout stage in the spring , possibly against other leading clubs who are out of @entity12			1
@entity5 believes the tactical understanding his players have in his methods is the key to whether @entity0 can reclaim a top - four place after finishing seventh last season			1
‘ you can not compare players under the guidance of @entity75 with those same players under the guidance of @entity3 , ’ he said			0
‘ every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics , so it is impossible to compare			0
i have to see for myself what those players are capable of before i can make any judgement - and two weeks is too short to say			0
’ victory : @entity0 beat @entity89 3 - 1 in @entity35 as they continued their 100 % record under @entity5 rivals : @entity0 will face @entity92 in @entity93 on sunday in the final of the @entity95			1

executive vice-chairman @entity4 promises @entity5 10 - week amnesty
@entity5 wants that time to train his players and get them ready for season

the @entity13 coach believes that can only be achieved through extra training
