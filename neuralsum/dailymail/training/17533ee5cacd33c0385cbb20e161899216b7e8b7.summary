by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 08:34 est , 20 july 2012 when charity fundraiser @entity2 was selected as an @entity5 torch bearer , she wanted a permanent reminder of the honour			2
the 54 - year - old hotel worker , from @entity9 , @entity10 , took the unusual step of inking the @entity5 rings on to her arm along with the words ' @entity14 ' above and ' @entity16 ' underneath			1
unfortunately for mrs @entity2 , her pride soon turned to red - faced shame when the tattoo artist managed to misspell the event as ' @entity21 ' in the permanent memento			2
gaffe : olympic torch bearer @entity2 had a tattoo on her arm to commemorate her part in the relay , only to find out it was spelt incorrectly mrs @entity2 , an overseas employee of the @entity28 - based @entity27 , was chosen to take part in the relay for her charity work , along with 70 other international colleagues			1
she paid $ 10 ( £ 6.40 ) to a ' really good ' tattooist for the words ' @entity14 ' to be inked above a picture of the @entity5 rings two months before her big moment			1
mrs @entity2 was flown over to the @entity37 especially , where she triumphantly carried the torch through @entity39 on june 30			1
it was not until after she had successfully carried the flame through the city and sent a photograph of the artwork to a friend that she realised the gaffe			0
mrs @entity2 , who lives in the @entity9 suburb of @entity49 , told @entity50 : ' i always wanted to have a tattoo but i never quite felt passionate about any one thing to have it put on my body permanently , ” the charity fundraiser told @entity50			1
' so when i was selected for this wonderful honour , i thought " that 's it - i 'm ready to have my tattoo "			0
' proud : @entity2 ( in white , right ) , from @entity9 in the @entity58 , carried the torch through @entity39 on 30 june after she was selected for her charity work by the hotel chain she worked for she was initially delighted with the tattoo until she noticed the mistake in the photograph			1
' i looked at it and i was so disappointed			0
i called my husband and he giggled a little bit			0
then i started laughing about it and i 've laughed ever since			0
' amazingly , mrs @entity2 has decided to keep the wrongly spelt tattoo on her arm - despite offers from the tattoo artist to remove it - as she says it is ' as unique as i am '			2
controversial artist @entity74 carried the @entity75 on the @entity75 leg between @entity77 and @entity78 in @entity79 today			0

@entity2 , 54 , is keeping the tattoo because ' it is as unique as i am '
she *originally* paid $ 10 ( £ 6.40 ) for the tattoo in her *hometown* @entity9 , @entity58
she only realised the mistake when a friend pointed it out after the relay
hotel worker carried the torch through @entity39 on june 30
