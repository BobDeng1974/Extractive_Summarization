losing a child is every mother 's worst nightmare but @entity3 knows all too well how it feels to watch helplessly as your baby dies in your arms			1
diagnosed with @entity8 two months into her first pregnancy , the 39 - year - old , from @entity13 's @entity12 province , lost her eldest two children from complications caused by the disease			1
the reason ? she was too afraid to admit to having @entity8 and was unable to access the drugs she needed to stop the disease from passing to her children			1
brave : @entity3 , 39 , from @entity13 's @entity12 province , was diagnosed with @entity8 in 2000 tragedy : @entity3 lost two of her babies to @entity8 before getting antiretroviral drugs but six years on from the death of her second child , @entity3 is a happy mother of two healthy children and is now a health worker who spends her time educating others about the risks of @entity8			1
' i am very healthy now , ' she explains , smilingly			2
' i live a healthy lifestyle , look after myself and have been on anti-retrovirals for nearly a decade			2
' my experiences are what makes me the person i am today			0
i have been through it all and have lived to tell the tale			0
' and @entity3 really has been through it all			1
healthy and well throughout her childhood and teens , her life was turned upside down when she was brutally attacked and raped aged 21			1
although she did n't know it , her attacker was @entity8 positive and it was to be another four years before @entity3 realised that she too had the virus			1
growing up , she knew little about the disease beyond that it meant ' death and dying '			2
' we knew that anyone who had @entity54 was a walking grave , ' she says			0
' all the photos we saw on tv and in magazines were of bone thin people whom you could tell were on their deathbed			0
' i did n't know anything except that it was a prostitute disease , ' she continues			1
' any woman who was hiv - positive was regarded as promiscuous			2
' even our pastors called it a punishment from @entity70 for promiscuity			0
' despite official denials , 1990s @entity13 was at the centre of a growing @entity54 epidemic - made worse by then president @entity76 's refusal to admit that it existed			0
as a result , while new infections dropped in countries like @entity81 , where the government swiftly moved to counter @entity54 and educate those at risk , the number of @entity13 infections multiplied rapidly			0
among them was @entity3 , although with no knowledge of the disease and no idea what symptoms to look for , it was n't until 2000 that the terrible truth was revealed			1
pregnant with her first child , @entity3 says she was ' so happy ' until a routine blood test two months in revealed that she was @entity8 positive			1
overwhelmed with shame and living in a community that stigmatised those with the condition , she kept it secret			0
' the stigma at that time was very high and there was very little care in the clinics			0
' everyone was scared - especially in the rural areas			0
' most people with @entity8 would commit suicide just so they did n't have to experience all the sickness , ' she continues			1
' if our government had taken @entity8 seriously then , there would not have been so much death			2
' just 14 months after @entity3 's diagnosis and seven months after he was born , her son became the first person in her family to fall victim to @entity54			1
' when i gave birth to a healthy baby who was not sick , i decided that i would breastfeed him myself , ' she says			0
' but he started getting sick at four months			0
i carried on , hoping he would be fine , but my baby died in my arms at seven months			2
support : @entity3 , who is now an @entity54 worker , with her niece @entity128 at her graduation disbelief : former @entity13 president @entity76 ( left ) refused to believe that @entity54 exists while @entity131 thinks a shower will protect you			2
as a result , @entity54 has reached epidemic levels in @entity13 programme : one leader who did respond to the crisis was @entity81 's @entity139			0
cases of @entity54 in his country are now falling rapidly ' judging by how sick he was , i knew it could only be @entity54			0
losing my child was not easy , i nearly died of heartache			2
i cried so much that i thought i would follow him			0
' the death of her son gave @entity3 the impetus she needed to finally seek help and in 2002 , she plucked up the courage to finally tell her friends and family			1
' i decided not to be silent anymore , ' she says			0
' it was time for someone to do something and who else if not me			0
' she threw herself into efforts to help other @entity8 positive women , working with @entity54 charity @entity163 to help educate rural communities			1
but tragedy struck again two years later when @entity3 became pregnant with her second child but once more , lost her to @entity8 shortly after birth			1
' i got a single dose of @entity170 [ an @entity172 drug ] and so did my baby but that was not enough , ' she remembers			0
' i was given one pill to take during labour but it was not enough to save her			0
we did get the treatment but we were among the unlucky			0
' my daughter @entity180 was born healthy but i soon realised that she was not growing , she was not gaining weight			2
' worried , she tried to have the little girl tested but was told that the baby was too young to take a @entity8 test			2
unwilling to give up , she asked a colleague to do a @entity187 cell count - which can indicate the presence of the disease - and her worst fears were confirmed			0
' she was found to be @entity8 positive , ' says @entity3 sadly			1
' but by the time she was started on antiretroviral drugs , it was already too late for her			1
she passed on two weeks later			0
' a heartbroken @entity3 was once more plunged into a morass of grief and recrimination			2
' my child got infected and i blamed myself every day for that , ' she says			0
tragic : although @entity13 is making progress , for many @entity8 sufferers , action has come too late speaking out : @entity3 hopes that more people will now speak out and wants to banish the stigma of @entity8 ' i hated that i tried to have a child again only to experience another death			1
i was angry and sad all the time			0
' devastated by the loss of her second child , @entity3 vowed never to get pregnant again but changed her mind after finally being given access to antiretroviral drugs			1
less than a year after beginning the course of medication , her viral load was so low it was virtually undetectable and later that year , her son @entity215 was born - healthy and @entity8 negative			1
four years later , a second healthy child , a daughter named @entity217 followed and @entity3 says that she could n't be happier			1
' i now have two @entity8 negative children and i believe i am the richest woman in the world			2
' currently , 600 @entity8 positive babies are born every single day in @entity222 , with many of the victims hailing from @entity3 's native @entity13			1
she now works as a mentor mother for charity mothers2mothers , which employs @entity8 positive women and sends them to work alongside doctors and nurses in understaffed health centres as members of the healthcare team			1
in one - on - one and group sessions , mentor mothers provide health education and psycho - social support to other hiv - positive mothers , as well as providing them with the wherewithal to protect their babies from @entity8 infection , and keep themselves and their families healthy .			1
