@entity1 ’s due date was widely reported as being last saturday , july 13 , but it has now been suggested that the official due date is actually today			1
the world 's press has been camped outside the @entity9 of @entity10 in @entity11 for a fortnight to ensure they do n't miss her arriving			1
and social media is continually awash with rumours that she has gone into labour			0
but the only confirmation from @entity1 has been that she was due in ‘ mid-july ’ , and last night a source claimed she was actually given today ’s date			1
this means the baby could arrive as far away as august 2 , because expectant mothers are only usually induced if the baby is two weeks late			2
the @entity27 source said : ‘ a small number of staff at @entity10 ’s who might be called upon when the @entity1 gives birth were told they had to remain teetotal for a month before the due date			1
’ speaking to the @entity35 , they added : ‘ they were told the due date was july 19			1
’ @entity38 and @entity1 's private office at @entity40 has refused to confirm the @entity42 's exact due date , although @entity1 herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this year that it is ' mid-july '			1
@entity38 was said to have had a few days off from his job as an @entity48 pilot in @entity49 this week , which he was thought to have spent with his wife at their @entity40 residence			2
@entity1 , 31 , stayed at the home of her parents @entity56 and @entity57 in @entity58 last weekend , while @entity38 played in two long - standing charity polo matches			1
@entity68 revealed during a visit to a children 's hospice near @entity71 , @entity72 : ' we are all just waiting by the telephone			1
we are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be here			1
' however , on wednesday the @entity79 appeared to suggest that the baby was already late			2
she told a 10 - year - old schoolgirl on a trip to @entity83 : ' i would very much like it to arrive because i ’m going on holiday soon ... i wish it would hurry up			2
' thrilled : @entity88 ( left ) asked the @entity79 : ' would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl ? ' to which the @entity79 replied she would like the royal baby to ' hurry up ' before she goes off on holiday to @entity96 a week today magic moment : @entity88 , 10 , ( with her back to the camera ) asks the @entity79 her question whether she would like the royal baby to be a boy or a girl on her trip to @entity83 outside the hospital are scores of people from all over @entity108 and the world , who are waiting for the royal arrival			1
@entity112 and @entity113 took two months to get to @entity10 , @entity114 because the retired fruit and veg merchants travelled from their @entity118 home to @entity11 via @entity108 ’s canal network at four mph			1
their 55ft canal boat @entity121 , is moored just behind the royal hospital , filled with bagfuls of cards and presents for the baby , and its cabin draped with bunting			2
‘ as soon as we heard @entity1 was pregnant , i said that we should aim to get there for the birth , so we left home on may 1 , ’ mrs @entity129 said			1
‘ and we hope to be here as long as it takes			0
after all , we ’re not paying for a hotel			0
’ dedication : @entity112 and @entity113 who have sailed down from @entity118 on their narrowboat to be near the hospital for the royal birth			0
with a top speed of 4mph the journey took two months @entity144 is now in his second week of living on a wooden bench opposite the street entrance to the @entity147 , @entity10 ’s private maternity unit			1
the retired carpenter from @entity150 has been a familiar fixture at major royal events for years , always dressed head to toe in @entity156 clothes beneath a @entity156 umbrella hat			0
the @entity158 , he says , know him as ‘ @entity159 ’			0
@entity144 , 78 , has been here so long that , a few days ago , he felt compelled to take himself back to @entity150 for a bath and a change of clothes			0
he then returned to @entity11 with enough spare @entity156 kit to last him as long as it takes			0
‘ what ’s another week ? ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s not boring and it gives my wife a rest from me			2
’ @entity171 presenter @entity170 has been knitting a pink bootie live on @entity171 ’s flagship today programme			1
‘ i think it may be even bigger news at home than it is here , ’ she said , adding : ‘ once @entity1 goes into labour , ’ she says , ‘ we ’ll be sleeping right here			1
’ prime position : @entity144 , who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently royal baby fever may have gripped much of @entity108 and indeed the rest of the world , but as one @entity187 interviewer found out , not everyone is in a frenzy of anticipation			2
when @entity192 anchor @entity191 asked @entity193 , the @entity79 's first cousin and close friend , if she was excited about the baby , her answer took the journalist by surprise			2
' not terribly , ' admitted the 88 - year - old , hooting with laughter			0
mrs @entity193 , who grew up with the @entity79 and was present at the @entity207 's deathbed in 2002 , sighed : ' well you know , everybody has babies			2
but i do n't get wildly excited about it			0
' ' heir to the throne ? ' prompted @entity191			0
' history ? ' eventually , possibly more to move on to more interesting topics than anything else , mrs @entity193 conceded : ' yes , all right			0
i 'm prepared to be excited			0
' the @entity187 tv host asked mrs @entity193 , the youngest daughter of the 16th @entity219 and his wife @entity220 , sister of the @entity207 , what sort of life the baby , which will be third in line to the throne , would have			0
mrs @entity193 said she hoped it would have ' just a jolly , happy , ordinary child 's life ' , something she said the @entity158 managed with the then princess @entity79 and @entity230			0
she added : ' the king and queen in those days made an enormous effort to give -- to keep their childhood sort of sacrosanct			0
i mean , it was just a time for learning and enjoying			0
' and i think that they have succeeded awfully well			0
