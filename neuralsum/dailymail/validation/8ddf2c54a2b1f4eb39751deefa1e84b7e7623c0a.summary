the first video of @entity3 - identified last week as @entity1 executioner @entity0 - has emerged the first footage of @entity1 executioner @entity0 as a shy teenage schoolboy has emerged			1
the video shows @entity3 , identified last week as the @entity8 fanatic filmed beheading hostages in @entity10 , being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football			1
the previously - unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at @entity15 , the secondary school in @entity16 , north @entity17 , where @entity3 was educated			1
the friendly kickabout is the first moving image to have been obtained of @entity20 before he became the @entity1 's depraved executioner - in - chief			0
in the film , obtained by @entity24 , the ' football mad ' teenager , thought to be around 15 at the time , is the second person to be chosen for the team			1
one of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting ' @entity31 ' , beckoning over the future jihadi			1
but he also appears to be painfully shy , instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him			1
@entity24 said @entity3 had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time			1
the footage , filmed in may 2004 , was broadcast this evening , after it emerged that the executioner had dumped two schoolboys on the @entity44 at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother			0
according to a former friend of his brother @entity50 , @entity3 and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008 , while he was living on the notorious @entity55 estate in west @entity17			1
after viewing the footage , @entity56 , the mother of @entity58 journalist @entity57 , told @entity60 it was ' frightening ' that a ' promising young person who had many gifts ' could use his talents for ' such evil '			0
she said : ' it 's very frightening he would end up filled with such hate			0
that 's very disturbing to me that young people would be attracted to such hate ? ' she added that the fact @entity0 had been identified did not help to bring her closure			0
she said : ' if it had not been that young man , then i 'm afraid it would have been someone else			0
i think it 's tragic for that young man and his family - it 's just so sad and we must do more to protect our young people from the lies that have instilled so much hate and brutality			0
' since being identified , @entity3 has emerged as a fun - loving young boy , who adored @entity87 , @entity89 games and eating chips			1
he was also said to have wanted to become a @entity92 star , scoring goals for @entity94 by the age of 30			1
the entries showed no sign he would go on to become the world 's most wanted man , who is believed to have beheaded a string of hostages in the name of @entity124			0
but , a decade later , @entity3 had shunned @entity110 life and was a ' known wolf ' to @entity127 , having already taken the path towards becoming @entity1 ' most notorious murderer			1

he also lists his favourite band as pop group @entity140 , and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30 , writes : ' i will be in a football team and scoring a goal			1

particularly at that age , for the boys , it is a time when the hormones start raging , and he had some issues with being bullied which we dealt with			0
