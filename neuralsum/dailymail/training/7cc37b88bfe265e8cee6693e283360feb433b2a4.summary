@entity1 senator @entity0 sent a signal on wednesday that he wo n't pull punches about his political party 's public - perception problems during a 2016 presidential run , candidly confessing that ' the @entity8 brand sucks			1
' appearing at a @entity11 @entity8 field office in a predominantly black section of metropolitan @entity13 , the eye - surgeon - turned - politician lamented @entity8 ' reputation of unfriendliness toward minorities , conceding that nonwhite voters are miles away from abandoning @entity18			1
' remember @entity19 ? ' he asked			1
' they admitted , " hey , our pizza crust sucks			1
" the @entity8 brand sucks and so people do n’t want to be a @entity8			1
' ' and for 80 years african - americans have had nothing to do with @entity8 , ' he continued			1
' why ? because of a perception			0
the problem is the perception is that no one in the @entity8 cares			2
' you got to show up , you got to have something to say and really we just have to emphasize that we ’re trying to do something different			0
' @entity0 has conducted an outreach offensive since last year , speaking to black audiences at the @entity52 , the historically black @entity53 , and other venues where republicans are typically treated with hostility and distrust			1
those speeches have brimmed with projections about policies that he says would help minorities more than what the party of @entity64 has managed			2
' @entity8 face a daunting task , ' he told the @entity53 audience in @entity68 in april 2013			2
' several generations of black voters have never voted @entity8 and are not very open to even considering the option			1
' ' @entity18 still promise unlimited federal assistance and @entity8 promise free markets , low taxes and less regulations that we believe will create more jobs			2
' he also promised to work toward reforms of a federal justice system that often sentences minor drug offenders – overwhelmingly minority offenders – to lengthy prison sentences			0
in an interview last year with @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity0 said the net effect is ' generations of young black kids who do n't have father figures around , and that 's how the cycle of poverty keeps going			1
that 's how the cycle of crime and despair keeps going			0
' on wednesday , @entity99 reported , he put in in stark terms of racial unfairness – a political taboo for most republicans			0
' we look at incarceration and we see a disproportionate number of people of color in jail , ' @entity0 said , ' and then when we see statistics on drug use , it seems to be about equal among all the different races			2
' ' blacks and @entity115 seem to populate our jails more			0
' during another of his listening - tour appearances , he spoke at the @entity120 , a traditionally hostile @entity18 enclave			0
that audience , however , hooted and hollered in support of his civil - libertarian positions on electronic privacy			0
he also debuted his pizza - as - politics observation there			0
' remember @entity128 ’s finally admitted they had bad crust ? ' he told the students in march			1
bad crust ; we need a different kind of party			0

@entity0 spoke at a @entity8 field office in a predominantly black area of @entity13
he 's making a major push to reach out to minorities with policy ideas including prison sentencing reform
likely presidential candidate is setting himself up as the *antidote* to staid @entity148 who lack connection to millennials and minorities
' remember @entity19 ? ' he asked . ' they admitted , " hey , our pizza crust sucks . " the @entity8 brand sucks '
blacks have shunned the @entity8 for 80 years , he said *ruefully*
