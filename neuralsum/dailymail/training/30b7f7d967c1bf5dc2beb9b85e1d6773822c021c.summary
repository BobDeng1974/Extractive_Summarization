two men are locked in a legal battle over a 65ft hedge which it 's claimed ruined the view of their picturesque @entity6 valley			1
the neighbours in @entity9 , @entity10 , have enlisted lawyers in the dispute after the hedge 's owner refused to cut a row of trees to half their height - a job which it is claimed would cost £ 10,000			1
it is the first ' hedge rage ' case of its kind in the rural region , thanks to new powers which were originally brought in under @entity26 's @entity25 in 2010			1
hedge rage : two men are locked in a legal battle over a 65ft - tall row of trees ( pictured centre ) which it 's claimed ruined the view of a picturesque @entity6 valley from a bungalow			1
' all we see is the hedge ' , he said landowner @entity38 , 58 , complained the spruce , larch , silver birch and beech trees on a private track had steadily blocked out the light from his bungalow			1
' when we bought the property 20 years ago we had uninterrupted views down the valley - now all we see is the hedge , ' he fumed to council officers			2
he asked 53 - year - old neighbour @entity52 to cut down the trees to just over 30ft tall , around half their current height			1
but mr @entity38 's neighbour refused , and the two men then became embroiled in a dispute about whether the row of trees legally counted as a hedge or not			1
the row has ended up in the hands of @entity62 , whose officers were forced to look up the @entity66 definition of a hedge			2
mr @entity38 said the trees did count as a hedge because there were hardly any gaps between them			0
but the hedge 's owner disagreed - with his solicitors writing : ' our client ’s position is that the trees do not in fact comprise a “ hedge ” because they were never intended to be a maintained garden boundary			0
dispute : council officers said the hedge should be cut every year to stop it growing above 33ft ( file photo ) ' they simply form part of a plantation of trees in a generally wooded rural location			1
' in our client ’s opinion the trees complained of do not cause any significant loss of light in the applicant ’s garden , and do not materially contribute to any effect on the growth of plants			0
' mr @entity38 told @entity100 he had already spent more than £ 1,000 on lawyers			0
' they grow by about a foot and a half a year , ' he said			0
' nothing has been done with them over the years and we have lost our view and light coming into the house			0
' not only that , we have concerns that they are a danger in high winds			0
the trees are very thin and during gales they get blown down			0
' council officers have now decided the trees are a hedge after all - and have recommended they are reduced in height to 33ft before birds have a chance to nest in them			2
if councillors rubber - stamp the plans today , the hedge 's owner could be legally bound to prune the trees every year so they never grow beyond 33ft again .			2
