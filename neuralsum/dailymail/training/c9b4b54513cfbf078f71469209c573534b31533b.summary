thousands of motorcyclists roared into the nation ’s capital for the two million bikers rally - as the nation observed moments of silence to honor the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks - intent on drowning out an event originally titled the @entity16			1
the @entity16 changed its name to the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , but that did not change the bikers ’ minds			1
denied the necessary permits to have a police escort through traffic and stopping for traffic lights , the massive assembly took just over an hour to move out			0
aerial footage showed bikers choking traffic on both highways and local roads			1
the bikes rolled through the city for 50 minutes for heading to the @entity52			0
riders told the @entity39 they believed the denial was for political reasons			0
‘ we ’re here for 9 - 11 , ’ national ride coordinator @entity56 told the paper			0
‘ we are going to have a peaceful ride ... but there are people who are sick and tired of their rights and liberties being taken away			0
’ with no definitive route , the groups spun around the city , flying their flags and calling out tributes the event was designed to drown out another titled the @entity16			2
although this was later changed to @entity73 ( @entity19 ) , the bikers were undeterred their patriotic duty : bikers ride on @entity77 on the @entity78 as they participate in the 2 million bikers to @entity5 rally , many called it their patriotic duty the thousands of participants roared through the city in their own tribute as the nation held minutes of silence authorities denied the accusations , noting that permits are not needed to rally in the capital			1

‘ i believe @entity98 has been in a 12 - year funeral			0
but i ’m a @entity100 man and not a @entity4			1
i believe in the resurrection ! @entity102 ! ’ the commenter added			0
@entity19 , the rally opposed by the bikers , began on the @entity78 just after 12pm – right as the bikers began to circle the area			1
with many streets surrounding the rally closed off to traffic , the bikers were not able to get to the rally of their disdain			2
‘ a historic event for solidarity of humanity to establish peace , harmony and justice , ’ is how @entity19 ’s facebook page described their rally , organized by the @entity116 ( @entity116 )			1
president @entity123 honoured the 3,000 people who died 12 years ago in a speech outside the @entity126 this was one of many tributes after @entity131 's attacks on the @entity132 and @entity126 in 2001 the rally , which started outside of the city , took over some of the main entrance points to @entity5 the riders did make their presence felt though , with clusters of motorcycles circling the surrounding blocks like hawks as @entity19 ’s speakers and organizers tried to rally			1
explaining that @entity98 - @entity4 ‘ stand with @entity98 against terrorism , ’ speaker @entity144 said ‘ we want to stand here in solidarity with the @entity98 people against hate and violence , ’ according to the @entity39			2
@entity100 protestors who showed up to protest against the @entity4 rally – in addition to the motorcycled masses – shouted back ‘ you picked the wrong day ! ’ not quite one million : demonstrators march across the @entity78 during what was planned to be the ' @entity73 : peace , @entity159 and justice throughout all this , motorcycles could be heard circling , coursing and revving their way around the rally			1
another speaker , @entity166 professor @entity165 preached social justice and peace , while condemning violence , said the @entity39			0
attendees tried to hold a moment of silence , but all they heard were revving motorcycles , @entity19 chief organizer @entity171 told the @entity39			2
no more social injustice ! : @entity165 speaks during a rally originally called the @entity16 peace , unity : mr @entity165 speaks during the rally , he condemned violence during his time on stage though not quite as large as the name would suggest , there were several thousand motorcyclists in attendance , stretching at least one - third of a mile long as they rumbled down suburban highways , according to reports			1
@entity19 also did not exactly live up to its name , with only a few dozen supporters showing up , according to the @entity39			2
several speakers also railed against conspiracy theories , @entity98 soldiers in the @entity194 and other ‘ fringe topics , ’ according to the @entity39			0
they were outnumbered by the throngs of park police and counter-demonstrators on hand , according to reports			0
you picked the wrong day ! : despite preaching peace and unity , and saying they were against terrorism , the @entity4 were shouted down by @entity100 counter-protestors a number of motorcyclists were involved in an accident on the ride into the capital , but no severe injuries were reported			1
the bikers ’ @entity94 page thank everyone for coming , wished everyone a safe ride home and said they ’ll see each other next year			0
@entity19 ’s website was down when @entity219 tried to access it , and its @entity94 page offered no indication the rally would happen again			2
the phone number listed on @entity116 ’s website went directly to a @entity227 voice mailbox that was full .			0

the two million @entity230 rally *suited* up to protest the @entity231 ( @entity19 ) , formerly called the @entity16
thousands of bikers choked highways and local roads , but did not make it to the @entity4 rally
@entity100 protestors shouted down @entity19 at every turn
