by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 22:13 est , 2 march 2014 @entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football ... with some star turns and a look through the leagues , too			1
this week includes @entity12 's nightmare @entity10 final , @entity14 's error in dropping @entity15 for the trip to @entity17 and @entity19 's managerial woes			1
1 ) @entity14 ’s decision to leave @entity15 out of the team at @entity17 forced @entity22 to take a deeper role – meaning the @entity25 star effectively played with the handbrake on			1
nearly half of the passes he played were in @entity31 ’s half of the field , and he failed to create a single chance for a team mate before going off nine minutes from the end			1
handbrake on : @entity31 midfielder @entity22 played a deeper role against @entity17 and was ultimately ineffective error : @entity31 manager @entity14 decided to leave @entity15 on the bench on saturday it was the first time in ten matches that @entity22 has not either made a chance or had a goal attempt of his own			1
2 ) @entity12 has been the catalyst for @entity46 ’s best form of late and looked as if he could be a @entity47 star when he set up @entity50 ’s early goal			1
after that , though , he suffered a nightmare against his former @entity54 team mates			2
they tightened up on him so much that by the time he went off with half an hour to go he had found a team mate with only two other passes			2
in all he only touched the ball 21 times , losing possession on 13 of those occasions , and got in just one cross			2
assistance : @entity12 ( left ) congratulates @entity50 after setting the frontman up against @entity54 crowded out : after his side 's opener , @entity12 failed to get the into the game which @entity46 went onto lose 3 ) @entity69 has never really established himself at @entity70 since he followed @entity71 from @entity72 as the first big buy of his management reign			1
if anything stops the 23 - year - old from making it at @entity79 , though , it wo n’t be lack of effort			2
given his first start of 2014 at @entity85 , @entity83 stats show he ran 7.9miles during 90 minutes of effort to contribute to the 3 - 0 win			0
no player in any saturday ’s @entity90 games went further , and his total of 63 sprints was only matched by @entity94 ’s hat - trick hero @entity95			1
workhorse : @entity70 midfielder @entity69 ( right ) covered more miles than any @entity90 player on saturday 4 ) it ’s just like old times in the @entity101 – a 4 - 1 win for @entity103 and a good performance by somebody called @entity106			1
that wo n’t be any comfort for @entity109 , though			0
it was @entity103 who beat @entity112 at @entity113 in front of a crowd of nearly 2,000 , to move into the play - off places in the @entity117			0
the @entity106 was left winger @entity118 who made a telling contribution as a second half substitute - but is no relation to @entity123 or @entity124 5 ) @entity19 have suffered from some odd management decisions all season and it looks as if @entity128 has dropped straight into the pattern			1
@entity130 was not only his best player in his first match in charge at @entity133 , but also helped the boss by translating the manager ’s instructions from @entity137			2
his reward was to be left on the subs bench against @entity94 – getting on only for the final 28 minutes when although he created a chance it was too late to rescue the game			1
struggles : @entity19 manager @entity128 ( left ) trudges off the @entity146 pitch on saturday 6 ) @entity148 owner @entity147 has praised @entity149 for bringing in seven new players for an outlay of just £ 6million during the january transfer window			1
clearly you get what you pay for			0
@entity149 used all of his new boys and started five of them in the 4 - 0 thrashing by @entity159 a week ago			0
by this weekend he ’d axed all but @entity161 and @entity50 from his starting line - up at @entity163 with only @entity164 and @entity165 coming off the bench – and @entity50 was one of the players he subbed			0
the 1 - 0 reverse at @entity163 meant the @entity169 ( or is it redbirds these days ? ) suffered their fifth defeat in seven @entity90 games since the former @entity173 star took charge			1
@entity175 : @entity161 ( left ) , pictured challenging @entity163 's @entity176 , kept his place in the @entity148 team 7 ) @entity179 has yet to find another job in football since failing to stop @entity183 slide to a second successive relegation during an ill - fated spell in charge at @entity187 last season			2
the former @entity70 and @entity190 star should at least be given credit , though , for being brave enough to give defender @entity192 his first team chance amid the wreckage of a disastrous campaign			0
the 23 - year - old has grown from there as the cornerstone of @entity200 ’s team this season , and was excellent in the 3 - 0 win over @entity202 that put the club top of the table			0
he is the only ever - present in 32 @entity206 games so far			0
8 ) @entity208 ’s red card in @entity210 ’s defeat at @entity211 might mean striker @entity212 finally gets the chance to start a game when @entity215 picks his side to face @entity217 at home next week			0
the lanky @entity219 , 27 , came on as a half time sub at @entity211 as former @entity25 boss @entity215 tried to orchestrate a fightback before his ten men ultimately lost 2 - 0			0
if the former @entity226 star does get to play next week it will be only his second start of the season – despite coming on as substitute an incredible 27 times			0
9 ) @entity230 will be leading the campaign for goal - line technology in the championship as well as the @entity90 as their barren run now stretches to more than 700 minutes without scoring			1
tough times : @entity230 boss @entity237 has seen his side go without a goal for over 700 minutes @entity239 thought he ’d brought the wait to an end with a 20 - yard drive against @entity243 which appeared to go a foot over the line			0
sadly for @entity230 boss @entity237 , who last saw his team score back on january 18th , ref @entity248 had to accept the advice of his assistant @entity250 who did n’t give the goal			0
just to make matters worse for @entity230 they ended up losing to another controversial decision when @entity254 was sent off for handling @entity256 ’s shot on the line , and @entity258 scored the resultant penalty			1
10 ) @entity261 ’s board were brave when they stuck by @entity262 early in the season – they were just two points above the relegation zone in october after losing to ten - man @entity266			0
they have got their reward in a sustained run of form since – and saturday ’s 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity271 made it four wins in the last five games			2
a crowd of nearly 7,000 saw @entity276 score twice and the @entity277 are now two points outside the @entity279 play - off zone with a game in hand over seventh placed @entity282 .			0

@entity12 failed to make a big enough impact in the @entity10 final
@entity22 's deep role for @entity31 against @entity17 made him ineffective
@entity128 's odd decision *hindered* @entity19 's chances against @entity94
@entity69 covered more ground than any other @entity90 player
