@entity0 was 23 years old when the proverbial penny dropped and , in turn , balls started landing in the back of the net			1
it took a big - money transfer to new surroundings to trigger his devastating improvement			0
similarly , @entity10 is 23 years old and has just completed a £ 16million move from @entity12 to @entity13			1
on monday night he scored both goals for @entity15 in a 2 - 0 victory in @entity17			1
it worked for @entity0 , now 25			2
he has 36 goals from 52 outings since swapping @entity38 for @entity39			1
so is @entity10 ready to enjoy a goals glut of his own in @entity42 ? his cv , of course , would suggest not ; 37 from 178 during the course of his club career equates to one every five games or so			1
team player : @entity10 often sacrificed himself for the good of the team at @entity12 club class : @entity10 completed his move from @entity12 to @entity13 on transfer deadline day but goalscorers need to be treated as such , deployed in a central domain with chances carved for their benefit			1
@entity10 , at @entity58 , spent more time on the wing than he did in the penalty box , something which irked the player himself			2
ironically , it was an injury to @entity0 which presented him with his chance in @entity65			0
he responded with a brace , the first poached from six yards and the second a cool finish from 12			0
you do n’t score those sorts of goals from the touchline			0
you can like our @entity72 here stepping up : @entity0 has become a key player for @entity15 since his move to @entity39 career changing move : @entity0 benefited from his move from @entity38 ( left ) to @entity39 ( right ) at @entity13 he will be used as a centre forward			1
@entity10 will have no excuse			0
this weekend the @entity83 face @entity84 , what better setting for the new boy to prove his worth ? for ultimately all strikers are judged on the goals they return			0
forget @entity10 the team player , the player who sacrificed himself manning a flank for @entity12			1
it is time for @entity10 to demonstrate a selfish streak , to make himself a certain starter for club and country			0
just the beginning : @entity10 can use his move to @entity13 to kick on and flourish for club and country his progress will be monitored with trepidation from the @entity103			1
for @entity10 was one of their own , an academy graduate whose potential will now be realised at a top - flight rival			2
@entity84 – the club who nurtured @entity0 - know the feeling			2
do n’t forget that @entity10 is still only 23			0
his double on monday took his @entity15 tally to 10			0
at the same age , @entity111 had one cap and no goals			0
@entity0 , similarly , has only flourished in the past 18 months			0
for @entity10 , @entity13 and @entity15 , then , this is only the beginning			1
@entity118 @entity15 players stepped up - @entity19			2

@entity10 scored both goals in @entity15 's 2 - 0 win over @entity17
the striker completed a £ 16m move from @entity12 to @entity13
@entity10 can take *inspiration* from @entity0 following his move from @entity38 to @entity39 in 2013 and kick on and become a better player
