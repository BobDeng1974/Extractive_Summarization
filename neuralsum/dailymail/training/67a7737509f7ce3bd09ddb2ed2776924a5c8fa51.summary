@entity1 drivers could soon be sharing the road with vehicles that do n't need them			0
@entity5 officials said monday they 've issued @entity6 the nation 's first license to test self - driving cars on public streets , after conducting demonstrations on the @entity12 and in @entity13 that show the car is as safe - or perhaps safer - than a human			1
for one thing , the engineers programed the car to create a ‘ virtual buffer zone ’ around obstacles , making it more aware than some drivers to boot			2
laser radar mounted on the roof and in the grill detects pedestrians , cyclists and other vehicles , creating a virtual buffer zone around the obstacles that the car then avoids			2
while some envision the robotic car dropping off its operator at the front of the mall and hunting for a parking spot on its own , mr @entity35 said not so fast			2
@entity1 's regulations require two people in the test cars at all times			0
a user , who is legally blind , sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed to date , @entity6 's cars have gone about 700,000 miles ( 1.1 million km ) in self - driving mode one person is behind the wheel , while the other person monitors a computer screen that shows the car 's planned route and keeps tabs on roadway hazards and traffic lights			1
if there 's a glitch , the human driver can override the autonomous auto with a tap on the brake or a hand on the steering wheel			0
last summer , @entity1 gov. @entity88 took the car for a spin in and around the state 's quiet capital city			0
but @entity93 , where costumed superheroes routinely take the crosswalks and massive billboards angle for the attention of starry - eyed tourists , was perhaps best suited to test the car 's main purpose			1
food run : @entity102 programmed the car to drive in for a quick bite to eat at a drive - thru ' they 're designed to avoid distracted driving , ' mr @entity35 said			1
' when you 're on the @entity12 and there 's a huge truck with a three scantily clad women on the side , the car only sees a box			0
' so far , @entity6 's applied to license three test vehicles			1
mr @entity35 said the cars will display red plates and an infinity symbol to represent their status as vehicles of the future			0
once they 're ready for the market - something mr @entity35 guesses could come in three to five years - the plates will be green .			1

@entity5 gives @entity6 first license to test self - driving @entity33 on public streets
car could be ready for market in as little as 3 - 5 years
