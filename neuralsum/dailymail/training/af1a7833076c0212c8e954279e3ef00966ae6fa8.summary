members of @entity1 on the political right are seething over the @entity5 administration 's apparent plan to turn as many as 34 million illegal immigrants into legal @entity8 residents , with one lawmaker claiming the president is engaged in ' covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases			1
' rep. @entity13 , a @entity15 @entity14 , said thursday that recent reports of a government program to mass - purchase blank ' green cards ' and work permits are ' proof that the groundwork is already being laid to grant amnesty post-election to millions upon millions of people who have broken our laws to enter this country			1
' ' the administration already has exceeded its authority to manipulate our immigration laws , and it is jarring to see the sheer scale of his future plans to do more , ' he said			2
@entity36 ( @entity36 ) issued a draft proposal this month , seeking a vendor to produce the paperwork that authorizes illegal immigrants to live and work in the @entity8			2
the @entity41 is preparing to issue an immigration - related executive order after the nov. 4 midterm elections			2
the draft came complete with photos of what the finished cards will look like			2
president @entity5 has pledged that he will make a move on immigration reform this year			1
his original timetable called for a decision by the end of the summer			2
@entity14 have decried the plan as an ' amnesty ' for millions of illegal immigrants , including hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have come across the @entity8 - @entity79 border this year			1
' this revelation provides startling confirmation of the crisis facing our @entity85 , ' @entity81 chairman @entity80 said in a statement			0
the @entity88 @entity14 accused @entity5 of ' preparing to issue work authorization and " legal " status to millions of individuals illegally present in the country , in violation of plain statute , ' in a bid to ' nullify the immigration laws of the @entity8 and its sovereign people			1
' @entity13 , the @entity98 , added that @entity8 immigration law serves two purposes : ' to protect the safety of @entity8 , and to protect @entity8 jobs			1
the president ’s covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases undermine both of those principles			1
' @entity36 spokesman @entity108 told the @entity109 that the proposal was a routine contract offer			0
' solicitations of this nature are frequent practice , ' he said , claiming the number of immigration applications can rise ' for any number of any reasons			0
' advocates for @entity79 and @entity121 immigrants have lambasted @entity5 for deporting illegal aliens even though the numbers are down sharply			2
this sept. 8 protest in front of the @entity41 featured a crying young boy ( left ) whose father was deported @entity5 delayed his immigration action until after the midterm congressional election to avoid alienating law - and - order voters , but can afford to frustrate illegal imigrants – who ca n't legally cast ballots a @entity36 official told @entity135 earlier in the week that the draft was published ' in case the president makes the move we think he will , ' but added that the agency 's @entity141 ( @entity143 ) is by no means committed to buying the materials			1
another agency official said the proposal was drafted as a contingency in case immigration reform legislation passes in @entity1 , not in anticipation of action from the @entity41			1
at the @entity41 on wednesday , a glib press secretary @entity152 claimed the @entity41 does not ' micromanage ' the ' ordering of specific colored sheets of paper ' by government agencies			0
' do n’t be absurd with us , ' a @entity157 reporter shot back			0
' that ’s not just an ordinary colored piece of paper			0
it is central to what the president has promised in public to do in public			0
' the online draft explains that ' @entity143 requires card consumables for the production of @entity36 ' @entity170 ( @entity171 ) and @entity172 ( @entity172 ) cards			0
' ' these cards and related consumables , when assembled , become highly specialized and secure identification documents			0
' and a successful bid , the draft solicitation says , will be able to support a ' potential " surge " in @entity171 and ead card demand for up to @entity185 ( 9 million ) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements			1
' @entity187 cards are issued once to each recipient			0
work authorizations are renewed annually			0
former @entity191 foreign service officer @entity190 , now an immigration expert at the @entity193 , told @entity194 that the @entity195 ' seems to indicate that the president is contemplating an enormous executive action that is even more expansive than the plan that @entity1 rejected in the ' @entity200 ' bill			1
' that legislation , which passed in the @entity202 last year only to be stalled in the @entity203 , was a broad reboot of @entity8 immigration policy that won support from a handful of @entity14			1
in included a provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for so - called ' dreamers ' – people living in the country illegally who were brought to @entity8 as children before june 15 , 2007			2
@entity5 's @entity215 ( @entity215 ) program , which he ultimately enacted without congressional support , uses the ead cards as part of its implementation			1
@entity36 says it processed 862,000 @entity221 overall between january and june of this year			0
but ' the guaranteed minimum for each ordering period is 4,000,000 cards , ' according to the draft @entity195			0
' the estimated maximum for the entire contract is 34,000,000 cards			0
' the company that ultimately wins the contract will also be required to store the blank cards until the government needs them			1
@entity36 draft solicitation uploaded by @entity135			0

@entity14 members of @entity1 are *hopping* *mad* over plan to buy at least 4 million blank cards per year – and maybe 9 million in the early going
one @entity15 lawmaker *slammed* @entity5 for planning ' covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases '
@entity5 administration paperwork says the move is ' to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements '
president pledged to *unilaterally* change @entity8 immigration policy this year , but recently pushed back his timetable until after *november* 4 elections
