scroll down to watch joke not amused : @entity1 has hit out at @entity8 and @entity10 for mocking her love life at @entity13 's @entity12 the @entity27 - winning singer is well known for documenting her personal relationships in her songs , often leaving little clues in the lyrics that hint at the subject			1

' ' there 's a special place in hell for women who do n't help other women ' : the country singer admitted to being furious about the hosts ' joke in january ' for a female to write about her feelings , and then be portrayed as some clingy , insane , desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her , i think that 's taking something that potentially should be celebrated - a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way - that 's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist , ' @entity1 said			1
poehler was quick to respond to @entity1 's comments , telling the hollywood reporter : ' aw , i feel bad if she was upset			1
i am a feminist and she is a young and talented girl			0
that being said , i do agree i am going to hell			0
' @entity8 was less sympathetic , telling @entity82 : ' if anyone was going to get mad at us , i thought it would be @entity86			1
i did not see that one coming			0
it was a light - hearted joke			1
' ( @entity8 was referring to a swipe made at the ex husband of @entity92 director @entity91			1

@entity1 , who notably refuses to reveal details of her personal life , did n't name any names herself in the interview , but said ' since 2010 i have dated exactly two people , ' referring to @entity38 and @entity39			0
awkward : @entity1 was in the crowd at the @entity12 as the hosts jokingly told her to ' stay away ' from actor @entity24 's 23 - year - old son , @entity109 ( far right ) according to @entity16 , @entity1 gave permission for an unnamed source to speak about her relationships in more detail , revealing that @entity39 , 19 , had ' chased ' @entity1 for a year and ' wore her down ' into dating him			1
the relationship ended after @entity39 was photographed kissing another woman , but he ' pursued her for the better part of a year until she finally took him back , ' the source said			0
@entity1 , who became a teenage darling within the country - pop scene for her raw , honest and catchy songs , has seen her music slowly becoming overshadowed by the spotlight cast on her private life			2
