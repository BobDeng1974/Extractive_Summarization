by @entity0 published : 17:13 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 17:13 est , 23 october 2013 sitting opposite me , her tight sweater hugging her chest , her skirt barely skimming slender thighs , was the woman i had idolised as a teenager - and ever since			1
it 's not often , when you 've been in the interviewing business as long as i have , that you experience the flutter of nerves that once beset you in the early days			1
but my guest on the radio the other day was @entity16 , undoubtedly one of the most famous women in the world - indeed the only recording artist to have had a number one hit in every one of the six decades since she began her long music career with @entity21 in the mid-sixties			1
' she 's one of us ' : @entity0 with her teenage idol @entity16 earlier this month she 's also known for being tough and outspoken and not suffering fools gladly and , as it 's my job to ask the difficult questions , there were plenty of sticky subjects to approach which could have led to disastrous silences during @entity32			1
there 's the two kids and two husbands who had an unhealthy relationship with drugs , the daughter who became a son , and the rumours that she 's spent half her life under the plastic surgeon 's scalpel			1
my first thought when i woke up that day was : what if she 's horrible ? it would have shattered all the affection for her which began in 1965 when @entity21 and @entity16 burst on the @entity51 music scene with @entity52			1
i was 15 , she was 19 and everything i wanted to be			1
she was beautiful with cheekbones to die for			1
her voice was deep and powerful			1
her hair hung around her face in the ' curtains ' my mother had banned , and her clothes were loose and comfortable - totally on trend - but considered sloppy and messy by the @entity64 audience who never took to her as quickly as the @entity51 did			1
( when we met , she confided that those clothes were made for her by a dressmaker friend , and that they were all she could afford at the time			1
) on the day , she arrived at @entity71 to a barrage of paparazzi , and surrounded by the kind of entourage that accompanies any major star			2
i counted at least nine people dancing attendance and providing for her every need			2
superstar : @entity16 at her most outrageous she carried no handbag , suggesting one of them was responsible for carrying her money - and a packet of tissues			2
she says she never gets sick , but had picked up the cold that 's going around			2
' that 's @entity51 for you , ' she said with a grin and coughed heartily			2
would she splutter through our interview ? thankfully not , after one of her minions handed her a plastic beaker with a straw containing some secret concoction			1
she is not a classically beautiful woman , but she is stunningly attractive			2
she 's tall and fabulously slim and toned			2
she wore a leather jacket , which she removed at my request on account of the creaking every time she gesticulated			2
not a good sound on the radio			2
underneath , she had on what she described as her @entity108 sweater , seriously tight			2
her skirt - an extended belt as my mother would have described it - and low - heeled black leather boots almost met at the hem			2
in other words , precisely the kind of thing she would have worn in the @entity117			2
her hair is long and dyed black with a hint of bouncy curl , and her skin is flawless			0
i studied it carefully and , while it 's obvious there 's been work done , she does n't have the tight , motionless features of one who 's indulged in excessive plastic surgery			1
we talked first about those early days and the reason for her separation from @entity21			1
while she acknowledged he was pivotal in guiding her career , she told me that she found his need to control her and play the older , wiser partner suffocating			0
they were together for 12 years , but then she broke away , craving independence			0
i suspect that since that day , no one has been able to tell @entity16 what to do or how to behave			0
and i should n't have worried that she would duck the controversial questions			1
why had she been critical of @entity141 and her ' twerking ' performance with the singer @entity143 , i asked ? was n't it a bit rich coming from someone who 'd unashamedly used shock tactics to engage her audience ? she 'd stunned @entity64 by baring her navel in the @entity150			1
she was apologetic , saying she 'd kind of jumped on a bandwagon of criticism of @entity141			1
she did n't blame her for knowing her own audience			1
she did , though , hold to her critique of the performance			0
it was , she smiled , simply bad and that 's unforgivable			0
so , what about the plastic surgery ? how much had she really had ? first of all , she denied that there 'd been any re-contouring of her body			1
she 'd worked hard at it , she said , by keeping fit , slim and toned : it was all through her own physical effort with no surgical assistance			0
she had , though , begun to worry about her ageing face in her 40s			0
when she was cast in romantic roles opposite actors such as @entity172 in @entity173 - for which she won a best actress @entity175 - she was very aware that he was in his 20s and the difference was glaringly apparent			0
she had a bit of bone shaved from her nose to give it a neater profile and had a nip and tuck			0
i suspected augmentation of the lips			0
there seemed to be a hint of a trout pout , though she denied it , saying she had no truck with anything that scared her			0
she had never had fillers or @entity196 , she said , and hated the idea of young people - who had nothing to fill - messing about with treatments she did n't think she could trust			1
@entity201 : @entity16 strikes a pose in 1978 she was open and confident about the work she had done , denying that she continued to feel pressure to look young			0
she claimed not to have any intention to go any further with surgery and insisted that what she had done had been entirely her choice and she had no regrets			1
she , at 67 , has four years on me and there 's no doubt she looks a good 30 years younger			0
it did n't make me like or admire her any less to know that she has cheated a bit			1
i would never go down that road , but then radio 's a very forgiving medium for an older woman			0
maybe if , like her , i 'd relied on my face and my figure to earn a crust i might have been tempted to make a different decision			0
sad , but seemingly unavoidable in our youth - obsessed culture			0
it was when we talked about her children that the emotion really surfaced			0
it had , she reckoned , been hell for them to be raised in the full glare of the publicity of being @entity16 's kids			0
she 'd supported them through drug rehab , but had found her daughter @entity237 's gender reassignment from female to male - he 's now known as @entity240 - incredibly painful			1
she said she had called @entity240 soon after his surgery and heard his female voice on the phone			1
he 'd forgotten to alter it and use a lower tone , and she asked him to leave it a little longer , a way of keeping in touch with the daughter she 'd known			1
she says she 's now completely happy with her son 's decision because it has made him happy - which is all any mother wants			0
so what was it like to meet the woman i idolised as a girl ? she was warm , passionate , kind and occasionally funny			0
and her voice is undiminished in its power			0
and i 've never seen so many people finding spurious reasons to pop into the studio for a peek			0
our conclusion ? ' she 's great			0
she 's one of us			0
just richer ! ' and with a very tight sweater .			0
