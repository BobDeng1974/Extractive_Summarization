last week a video of @entity1 mimicking @entity3 ’s notorious goal celebration surfaced on the @entity6 ’s @entity5 website			1
soon enough , when the tournament gets under way in @entity9 , @entity3 will be hoping to show the world how it really should be done			1
dancing king : @entity3 having a dance after scoring against @entity13 earlier this year hitman : @entity3 should be @entity16 's main main up front at the @entity5 in @entity9 ‘ in a @entity5 , if i was to score a goal ... if i can score one goal i would be happy because i have come a long way , ’ he admitted			1
there is a maturity about @entity3 , a growing sense of belonging at the highest level of the game after an outstanding season with @entity26			1
after their final fixture , when his attention turned to the @entity5 , @entity3 was flicking through the record books when he came across the name of an @entity16 great			1
‘ i looked at @entity34 ’s stats and he scored 10 goals in the @entity5			1
i thought , “ wow , that ’s a huge task for anyone to get anywhere near that ”			2
’ @entity34 ’s name conjures images of his goals at the @entity43 @entity5 , when he wore a plaster cast on his left wrist as @entity16 progressed to the quarter - final			1
four years later @entity34 scored four at @entity47 before the heartbreak of defeat against @entity50 in the semi-final			1
‘ when i look at that , 10 goals in two @entity54 that he played in , that is incredible			1
if i can score even one goal i ’d be happy because i have come a long way			1
’ fancy footwork : @entity1 tries to recreate @entity3 's famous dance strutting his stuff : @entity3 's shows off his famous goal celebration it has all fallen into place for the @entity26 striker , a key part of @entity64 ’s @entity5 plans as they prepare for their opening game with @entity68 on june 14			1
he hopes to hit the bullseye			2
‘ somebody can say , “ i ’m going to win this game of darts ” , but when they play they might not win , ’ he added			2
‘ it ’s easy to say when you ’re going to do it , but more difficult to do it			2
i ’m thankful to @entity80 for allowing me to have a decent season			0
the @entity5 is a different level of football to the @entity84			1
‘ you have to understand it ’s everyone ’s dream to play in a @entity5 as a kid			1
i ’m just excited about it			0
’ he has every right to be optimistic			0
this season , with the backing of his @entity26 manager @entity91 , he scored 21 times in the @entity84			1
it has forced @entity64 ’s hand , right at the front of the queue for a place in @entity16 ’s forward line			1
he is flourishing at every level			2
partners : @entity3 ( left ) says that he is confident that he can work well with @entity102 ( right ) ‘ i ’ve just been given the opportunity and that ’s what i ’ve asked for in the past , ’ he added			1
‘ i do n’t think the manager needs to give me a confidence booster and say , “ you are my main man , you are the best ”			0
‘ everyone wants to play			0
even if you ’re 15 and in the youth team you believe you ’re good enough to play in the first team			0
’ he has taken the long way round to international football , finally establishing himself as a regular international under @entity64			2
there was frustration at @entity116 and @entity117 before he finally found a manager who truly believed in his goalscoring instincts			0
lethal : @entity3 ( right ) formed a deadly partnership with @entity121 ( left ) this season ‘ it ’s down to the clubs which players they want to give a chance to and the philosophies they choose , ’ he added			1
‘ i ca n’t speak for @entity117 or @entity116 and say they are wrong			0
when you ’ve money to spend it ’s very easy to buy someone worth £ 50m rather than say , “ i ’ll play this 20 - year - old @entity133 player ”			0
‘ you can only roll the dice and see how they perform			0
i ’m thankful for everything that happened at those previous clubs			0
@entity116 put me on the map in terms of giving me a chance to play in the first - team environment and @entity117 also helped me to improve mentally and as a footballer			0
i would never regret anything			0
’ everything has happened so quickly since the end of the season that @entity3 has n’t had time to dwell on the title race			2
he has ‘ boxed it off ’ , in his words , putting it to one side until he gets a chance to reflect on it after the @entity5			2
international : @entity3 ( centre ) in action for @entity16 against @entity13 earlier this year ‘ you ’ve got to move on			1
it was n’t a great feeling , but we set ourselves the target of getting into the @entity166 , so everybody ’s content			0
but sometimes you get so close , feel like you ’ve almost won it and then do n’t achieve that , it ’s disappointing			0
‘ it ’s about moving forward , performing at the @entity5 and enjoying it			2
there ’s no favourite at the @entity5 — people did n’t expect @entity26 to qualify for the @entity166			1
’ even though they were eventually beaten to the @entity84 title by @entity116 , @entity3 ’s partnership with @entity121 flourished			1
the @entity180 , who still hopes to face @entity16 in @entity182 on june 19 despite a knee injury , scored 31 times in the league			1
prolific : @entity34 scored 10 @entity5 goals for @entity16 , playing in 1986 and 1990 there are those who believe @entity3 is very much the junior partner in that @entity26 forward line , but he has had a remarkable season			1
‘ if @entity121 is world class , @entity121 is world class , ’ added @entity3			2
‘ that ’s everyone ’s opinion and that ’s how they feel			0
everyone is entitled to their opinion			0
‘ for me i am just working every day on the training field the same way that @entity121 works			0
we work to reach the optimum level our bodies can reach			2
at the end of the day i am happy performing the way i am performing			0
i am working harder to improve even more and that ’s the most important thing for me			0
‘ everyone has their own opinions on what footballers they like			0
i like @entity211 , some people like @entity213			0
it is down to individual preferences			0

@entity26 striker admits @entity5 is a different level of football to the @entity84
