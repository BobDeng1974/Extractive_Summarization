half of a dozen popular small cars tested for how they would stand up to a crash did not fare well , an influential road safety group found			1
six of the cars tested , most of which were 2013 models , were rated ‘ poor ’ or ‘ marginal			1
’ @entity11 's @entity10 and @entity12 each received marginal scores , while @entity15 's @entity14 were rated ‘ poor ’ in the results released thursday by the @entity17			1
@entity19 's @entity18 also got a poor rating , while @entity22 's @entity21 was ranked ‘ marginal			2
’ scroll down for crash test video smashed : six of the 12 small cars tested by @entity17 , most of which were 2013 models , were rated ' poor ' or ' marginal , ' among them @entity27 ( pictured ) intense : as part of the test , small vehicles were crashed at 40 mph into a 5 - foot - high barrier on the driver 's side worst - case scenario : in cars that did not score well , safety cages collapsed , driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy 's head hit the instrument panel two redesigned @entity42 models , the 2 - door and the 4 - door , were the only small cars to get the top rating in stringent front - end crash tests performed by the insurance industry group			1
in the worst cases with the small cars that did not score well , safety cages collapsed , driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy 's head hit the instrument panel , and side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection , @entity17 chief research officer @entity47 said			1
of the 12 models tested , the @entity57 fared the worst , the institute said in a press release			0
its seat belt allowed too much slack , and the side curtain airbag deployed but did n’t provide enough protection			0
the crash dummy ’s head hit the windshield pillar and instrument panel			0
in the test of the @entity68 , the steering column moved nearly 5 inches to the right as the test dummy ’s upper body moved forward and to the left			0
‘ the rotation meant that the dummy ’s head barely contacted the front airbag , ’ the institute reported			0
‘ at the same time , the safety belt spooled out too much , allowing the dummy to move forward 13 inches and hit its head on the dashboard			0
the side airbag did n’t deploy			0
’ by comparison , the @entity83 sustained only minimal intrusion into the occupant compartment , providing ‘ survival space for the dummy , ’ which remained well - protected from impact			0
the @entity17 increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle			2
the insurance group said nearly a fourth of @entity98 front - of - vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve only a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole			2
the @entity17 continues to score vehicles on side , rear , rollover and front - end crashes that impact more than just a corner			1
failing grade : @entity18 received a ' poor ' rating based on its performance in the crash test biggest loser : of the 12 models tested , @entity57 fared the worst because its seat belt allowed too much slack , and the side curtain airbag deployed but did n't provide enough protection ‘ this is a challenging new crash test and it 's not surprising that some vehicles are earning marginal and poor ratings , ’ @entity17 spokesman @entity122 said of the small overlap front crash test			1
‘ this crash scenario does n't lend itself to a @entity130 fix so for most manufacturers the countermeasure will have to be built in when there 's a full redesign , ’ he added			0
vehicle manufacturers in the @entity98 market often design and engineer their models to score well on @entity17 safety tests and use the results in their marketing			2
‘ it matters because in today 's world cars are so competitive that all you need is a small flaw and your competition can exploit it , ’ @entity142 senior analyst @entity141 said			2
good / acceptable ratings : @entity42 4 - @entity151 2 - @entity150 @entity149 ( 2014 ) marginal / poor ratings : @entity153 ( 2014 ) most of the 12 small cars tested were already in production before the @entity17 increased the rigor of its front crash test last year			1
however , @entity122 said @entity17 alerted the companies to the work the group was doing on small overlap research in 2009			2
the specifications of the test were not finalized until the last year , which is late in a car 's development process , @entity141 said			0
all automakers will eventually redesign their cars to meet the standards to pass the new crash test , he said			0
in the tests , @entity17 crashes a vehicle at 40 mph into a 5 - foot - high barrier on the driver 's side that overlaps one - quarter of the vehicle 's width			1
@entity15 pointed out that the @entity17 small overlap crash test goes well beyond federal requirements and the group has recognized numerous @entity15 vehicles as top safety picks			1
the @entity186 automaker said it would evaluate the results carefully , but the company was proud of its safety record			0
@entity11 said customer safety remains its highest priority and it is committed to its cars performing well in all types of crashes			0
‘ we are aggressively working to incorporate these into our models , including our small cars like the @entity10 and @entity12 , where technically feasible , ’ @entity11 spokeswoman @entity197 said in an email			1
@entity19 and @entity202 said they were proud of their cars ' safety records in federal crash tests and other @entity17 crash tests , but they would review the small overlap test results and incorporate what is learned into future designs			2
top of the list : two redesigned @entity42 models , the 2 - door and the 4 - door , were the only small cars to get the top rating passing grade : 2013 @entity214 received an acceptable rating in the test aced it : both the 2 - door and 4 - door models of @entity42 excelled in the @entity17 test the small car segment was the fourth group of cars rated using this new test , and most of the groups have fared equally badly			1
last summer , seven of 11 luxury sedans evaluated rated ‘ marginal ’ or ‘ poor , ’ and 12 of 15 small suvs tested also failed to score well in results released in may			2
family sedans scored the best , with only five of 18 scoring ‘ marginal ’ or ‘ poor ’ in results released last december			2
as a group , the small cars fared worse than the mid-sized family sedans , but better than the small suvs , @entity17 said			1
results on the new crash test for mini-cars will be released later this year			0
the other six small cars tested included two - and four - door versions of @entity240 's @entity42 , which both received ‘ good ’ ratings			1
the @entity42 was tested earlier this year and the results were released in march			0
receiving ‘ acceptable ’ ratings were @entity244 's @entity214 , @entity246 's @entity245 , @entity248 's @entity247 and @entity250 's 2014 @entity249			0
upping the ante : the @entity17 increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle dangerous : in the models that did not do well on the test , side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection the @entity42 ( pictured ) was tested earlier this year and the results were released in march all the cars scoring well received ‘ @entity263 + ’ ratings by the insurance trade group			1
vehicles earning the institute 's award have received ‘ good ’ ratings in the four traditional tests plus ’ good ’ or ‘ acceptable ’ ratings in the small overlap test			1
@entity17 said it did not test the @entity273 because the automaker plans to release a redesigned 2014 model this month			0
the market for small cars is one of fastest - growing in the @entity98 automakers have made the cars quieter and more refined as people who want good gas mileage turn to compacts and subcompacts			1
so far this year , @entity98 have bought more than 1.8million new small cars , up 12 per cent over a year ago , according to @entity286 ‘ manufacturers need to focus on the whole package , " @entity47 , the @entity17 's chief research officer , said in a statement			1
‘ that means a strong occupant compartment that resists the kinds of intrusion we see in a frontal crash like this , safety belts that prevent a driver from pitching too far forward and side curtain air bags to cushion a head at risk of hitting the dashboard or window frame			0

@entity17 crashed small vehicles at 40 mph into a 5 - foot - high barrier on the driver 's side
group rated cars ' good , ' ' acceptable , ' ' marginal ' or ' poor '
two @entity42 models were only small cars to get top rating
