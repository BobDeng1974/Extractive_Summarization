after what will have seemed like an eternity to @entity4 fans , @entity0 leads his men into the @entity6 for the first time in five seasons on tuesday			1
no more painful evenings of sitting at home watching the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 mixing it with the best in @entity18 , while @entity4 toiled against the continent 's second tier , or worse still had no @entity22 football at all at @entity23			0
but back in 2009/10 , instead of leading @entity4 to their third @entity6 final in six seasons , @entity24 - the man in charge at the time - oversaw a disastrous third - place finish in their group with @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity34 @entity33			1
and to illustrate just how much has changed at the club since the 2009/10 season , we 've picked out five key points from autumn 2009 at @entity23			2
in just five years @entity39 has gone from obscurity to worldwide fame with @entity4 and @entity42 star forward @entity39 was just a 14 - year - old trainee with @entity43 @entity39 might be a household name to many now with his trademark direct running and rapidly - improving link - up play , but back then the @entity43 prospect was so young he would have been denied entry to a 15 - certificate film at his local cinema			0
he went on to join the @entity52 in an initial deal of £ 400,000 in early 2010 after being wowed by former @entity4 hero @entity54 on a visit to @entity56 to check out the set - up			0
back in 2009 @entity0 only surived a few months at struggling @entity58 @entity0 was about to get shown the door at @entity58 the @entity60 was considered a talented up - and - coming manager after a spell working with @entity63 at @entity14 and helping @entity64 to avoid relegation in his first managerial job			0
but things did n't go quite so well at @entity68 , when the then 36 - year - old rookie boss only made it to december before a poor run of results saw him leave by mutual consent			0
after a short spell out , the resilient @entity0 took @entity75 up in his first season and comfortably kept them there before @entity4 came calling			2
@entity79 duo @entity78 ( left ) and @entity80 oversaw a tumultuous running of the club at that time @entity78 and @entity80 were still in control of the club the tumultuous reign of the @entity79 was still in full effect in the autumn of 2009 ( they were n't ousted until late 2010 ) as @entity24 found himself constantly clashing with @entity88 and @entity80 over the running of team affairs			1
just how destabilising their control of the club had been did n't become clear to many until they 'd been shown the door in dramatic fashion			0
@entity97 was bought in to replace @entity98 in the @entity4 midfield for the 2009/10 season @entity97 is the man entrusted to replace the hugely popular @entity98 selling @entity98 to @entity101 in the summer of 2009 is a mistake @entity24 must still rue to this day			1
but buying @entity97 for £ 20million , who was injured for the first few weeks of his @entity4 career , was arguably a bigger mistake			0
@entity97 only managed a handful of games for the @entity52 , before a number of loans in his native @entity111 finally brought about a permanent sale to @entity31 at a huge loss			0
even more damaging was the @entity98 - shaped hope in the @entity4 midfield for some time after			2
@entity115 , seen here in @entity4 's disastrous campaign , is one of only three surviving senior players @entity119 ( left ) and @entity120 lined up for @entity4 in their last @entity6 match @entity115 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 are the only remaining senior players from that period the best way to illustrate the churn of players through the door at @entity23 since that time is that the only current senior players from the 2009/10 are @entity115 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
the starting line - up in @entity4 's final match of that campaign ( which they lost 2 - 1 to @entity31 ) included such stellar talents as @entity120 in goal , @entity138 and @entity119 in defence , while @entity140 put his attacking skills to great effect on the left wing			1
@entity6 winner in 2005 with @entity4 , @entity145 , reveals his happiness about their return @entity4 fans will be hoping their return to the @entity6 has a very different outcome to the last time they graced @entity18 's elite competition .			1

@entity4 return to the @entity6 for the first time since the 2009/10 season on tuesday
they go up against @entity158 from @entity159 in their first game
@entity101 and @entity162 are the other teams in @entity4 's group
see how @entity39 and @entity0 ' careers have *progressed* since the 2009/10 season
@entity115 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 are the only surviving senior players from that fateful season
@entity78 and @entity80 were still in control of the club
@entity97 was the player bought to replace @entity98 and drive @entity4 to their third @entity6 final in six seasons
