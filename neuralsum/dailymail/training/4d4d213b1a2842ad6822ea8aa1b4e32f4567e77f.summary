by @entity0 never mind being too tired or too busy – it seems millions of women are put off sport simply because they can not find a suitable bra			1
almost one in five @entity6 women said they suffered pain or embarrassment caused by their breasts when exercising			1
this discomfort was a bigger deterrent than the cost of exercise , lack of access to facilities or not having anyone to exercise with – and many blamed the problem on being unable to find the right sports bra			1
bra : millions of women are put off sport simply because they can not find a suitable bra researchers at the @entity26 , who carried out the survey , urged women to get their sports bras professionally fitted and said schools should educate girls about the importance of wearing them			1
it follows a call from the head of @entity37 for schools to put hairdryers in changing rooms to prevent image - conscious girls being put off @entity42			0
latest figures show girls in the @entity6 are the fattest in @entity45 , with almost a third of under - 20s classed as overweight or obese			0
uncomfortable : having the wrong sports bra , was a bigger deterrent than the cost of exercise , lack of access to facilities or not having anyone to exercise with they are also among the least active , with only 6 per cent doing the recommended five sessions of exercise a week , and there are fears they will become the first generation to die at an earlier age than their parents			0
previous research has shown more women wear a fashion bra when exercising than a sports bra , which can provide extra support and limit embarrassing and uncomfortable movement			1
in the latest study , some 239 women aged 18 to 64 answered dozens of questions about their exercise habits , including how much sport they did and what put them off taking part			2
lack of energy or motivation was the top reason , followed by lack of time and then health issues			0
but concerns about breasts , including pain and embarrassment , came in at fourth place , ahead of cost issues and lack of facilities			0
in all , 17 per cent of the women surveyed said problems caused by their breasts put them off sport , the @entity94 and @entity95 reports			2
researcher @entity100 said something as simple as a well - fitting sports bra could lead to women doing more exercise			2
she added : ‘ we had plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest breasts are a barrier to exercise but this is the first study to provide evidence that they are affecting women ’s participation in sport			0
