a football fan has blasted a @entity2 club after shelling out £ 38 on an away - end seat that offered almost no view of the pitch			1
@entity7 supporter @entity6 was horrified when he got to his seat at @entity9 on saturday to watch the away clash with @entity11 to find his view was almost completely blocked			1
instead of watching his beloved @entity7 clinch a last - gasp 1 - 0 win in the @entity2 match , mr @entity6 was forced to stare at a massive steel container - thought to be a commentary box - which obstructed most the pitch			1
he is now demanding a full refund for his £ 38 ' restricted view ' seat - because he claims it was far too restricted			1
he said : ' i think it is crazy that they can legally sell these			0
' whether £ 38 is cheap for a @entity2 ticket or not , i would n't have taken the ticket for free having known the view			1
' i do n't understand how the club has n't been sanctioned before , it is absolute madness			0
i would have been a lot angrier had we not grabbed a 90th - minute winner			0
' he is now demanding a refund after the picture he tweeted from his seat went viral on @entity46			0
a spokesman for @entity11 said : ' @entity9 is an all - seater stadium and while we understand the supporter ’s frustration , we as a club advise fans to sit down for a number of reasons			2
' safety is of paramount importance and the main purpose for asking everyone to sit down , but it is also to ensure the best possible view of the pitch from all seats			2
' owing to the structure of @entity9 , if everyone in the stadium stood up there would be a number of viewing positions where it would not be possible to see both goals			0
@entity9 is n’t unique in this			0
' once again , we are sorry to hear of the supporter ’s disappointment following his visit to @entity9 and in light of his observations , we will be contacting all opposing clubs in advance of their fixture at our stadium to reiterate to them the importance of their supporters remaining seated to ensure the best possible viewing experience for their fellow fans			2
