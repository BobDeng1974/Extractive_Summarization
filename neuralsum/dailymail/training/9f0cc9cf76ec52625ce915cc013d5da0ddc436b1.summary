former home secretary @entity0 this morning said he asked officials to look carefully at a dossier handed to him in the 1980s allegedly containing claims of a @entity6 paedophile network			1
the @entity8 peer released a statement after he was challenged to make public what he knew about the file handed to him at the time by a fellow conservative mp			1
@entity14 , the @entity15 mp for @entity16 , told the @entity17 that @entity0 had been sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles between 1983 and 1985 by @entity14 mp			1
@entity15 mp @entity14 called for a @entity22 style inquiry into historic child abuse sex allegations			1
he said @entity0 , who was home secretary in the 1980s should share his knowledge about a dossier sent to @entity26 detailing allegations of a @entity6 paedophile ring @entity0 this morning said he had received the dossier during his time as home secretary			1
he said he had asked officials to look into the claims , but did ' not recall being contacted further about these matters '			1
in a statement released through his lawyer , @entity0 said : ' during my time as home secretary ( 1983 to 1985 ) , @entity14 mp arranged to see me at the @entity39			1
i invariably agreed to see any mp who requested a meeting with me			2
' as i recall , he came to my room at the @entity39 with a substantial bundle of papers			2
as is normal practice , my private secretary would have been present at the meeting			0
' i told mr @entity14 that i would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the @entity39 and acted on as necessary			1
' following the meeting , i asked my officials to look carefully at the material contained in the papers provided and report back to me if they considered that any action needed to be taken by the @entity39			1
' in addition i asked my officials to consider a referral to another @entity51 , such as the attorney general 's department , if that was appropriate			2
' this was the normal procedure for handling material presented to the home secretary			0
i do not recall being contacted further about these matters by @entity39 officials or by mr @entity14 or by anyone else			1
' in a second statement released by mr @entity0 , he clariffied what happened to the dossier			2
he said : ' in the last hour i have been alerted to a @entity39 independent review conducted last year into what information it received about organised child sex abuse between 1979 and 1999			0
' the review found information had been dealt with properly			0
it also disclosed that material received from mr @entity14 in november 1983 and january 1984 had not been retained			1
' however , a letter was sent from myself to mr @entity14 on march 20 , 1984 explaining what had been done in relation to the files			2
' lord @entity0 's statements today came after @entity15 mp mr @entity14 told a parliamentary committee yesterday that he believed politics was the ' last refuge of child sex abuse deniers '			1
he repeated his call for a @entity22 - style inquiry into historical paedophile allegations			2
mr @entity14 appeared before mps on the @entity17 after accusing the late @entity87 mp sir @entity87 for @entity16 ( pictured ) of being a paedophile lord @entity0 said last night that he would be issuing a statement at lunchtime today ' about the handling of such papers in the @entity39 '			1
mr @entity14 helped expose the full extent of @entity96 mp @entity87 's paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year , serialised in the @entity98			1
the call for an inquiry into how @entity87 , the former @entity16 mp , and other high - profile paedophiles such as @entity103 evaded justice for so long has now gained the support of 120 mps			0
mr @entity14 said a public inquiry would shed light on what was known about prominent paedophiles , and what the police and senior politicians did about it			2
he told the @entity115 home affairs select committee that he believed a series of home secretaries had questions to answer over what they had heard about allegations of paedophilia in high places			0
he said the late @entity8 mp @entity125 had written to @entity0 , home secretary from 1983 to 1985 , about paedophiles ' operating and networking within and around @entity6 '			1
' i do think it would be helpful for sir @entity0 to share his knowledge of how he dealt with these allegations that were made at the time , ' said mr @entity14			1
' i think that politics is the last refuge of child sex abuse deniers			0
other institutions , the police , have dealt with this and changed their culture			0
' but politics suffered from ' a continual view that we should sweep it under the carpet , that we should n't speak about it , that we should n't name people , that there should n't be a discussion about what 's gone on '			0
@entity0 ( pictured at his @entity151 home ) was elevated to the @entity152 in 2000 after a fifteen years in the @entity115 and 10 years at the @entity153			0
he was also knighted in 1989 mr @entity14 said he had faced pressure not to name those allegedly involved in sexual abuse and said only an inquiry could ' bring all the different strands together '			2
' i do n't have all the answers , but we have to understand why the authorities failed to investigate such high - profile cases , ' he said			0
earlier this year , mr @entity14 published a book into @entity87 's decades of abuse of young children , including at @entity168 school where he was a governor			2
a number of suspects have been identified and the mp said he understood from police that arrests were ' imminent '			0
in 1976 @entity87 wrote to the @entity173 criticising its investigations into the ' private lives of certain @entity106 '			0
the politician , who died in 2010 , expressed ' deep concern ' about a probe into an alleged campaign to discredit members of parliament			0
at the time the media had been investigating claims that @entity185 secret agents had been trying to smear @entity187 mps			0
in another letter , he urged the then home secretary , @entity190 , to ensure the @entity173 was not using public money for ' muck - raking '			0
former children 's minister @entity193 said @entity87 's letters were ' bully - boy tactics ' .			0
