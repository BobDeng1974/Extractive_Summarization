by @entity0 published : 15:08 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 09:30 est , 21 september 2012 space shuttle @entity1 returned to its @entity3 roots thursday after a wistful cross-country journey that paid homage to @entity7 workers and former @entity9 rep. @entity8 and her astronaut husband			1
' that 's my spaceship , " said @entity1 's last commander , @entity13 , as the couple watched the shuttle loop over @entity16 , @entity9			1
afterward , a 747 jet carrying @entity1 swooped out of the desert sky and glided down a concrete runway at @entity20 , 100 miles north of @entity21 , not far from where the now - retired shuttle fleet was assembled			1
next stop : @entity21 where @entity1 will be prepped for a slow ride on a special flatbed trailer through city streets next month to its final destination as a museum showpiece			1
@entity8 was ' elated ' and started ' hooting and hollering ' as soon as she saw the shuttle emerge from behind the campus athletic center , said her former aide @entity64			1
@entity13 said it recalled the memory of landing the shuttle , which was challenging because it does n't use its engines as it returns to @entity69			1
' landing a space shuttle is not easy , ' @entity13 said			1
' it does n't glide very well			0
' @entity72 : @entity8 , who is still recovering from a 2011 attack in @entity16 that nearly took her life , looks joyful as the shuttle flies overhead , while her husband looks pensive keeping watch : thousands of students and faculty on the @entity80 as the @entity1 flies over , left , and right , astronaut @entity13 , husband of former congresswoman @entity8 , talks about watching the space shuttle @entity1 flying over @entity16 nothing but blue skies : @entity1 passed over @entity16 ; @entity13 , a former astronaut who commanded @entity1 's final mission to space in may 2011 , said it was his spaceship the retired shuttle took off from a @entity89 airport thursday morning , and will end up in @entity21 after spending the night at @entity20 , 100 miles north of @entity21 , then making one last low - flying pass around the state			1
the stop in @entity16 was requested by @entity13 , the last person to command an @entity1 mission			1
he and @entity8 recently moved back to @entity16 from @entity89 , where @entity8 was recovering from serious injuries she suffered in a 2011 attack in which a gunman killed six people and wounded @entity8 and 12 others			1
hundreds gathered on the grass mall at the @entity32 to catch a glimpse of the @entity103			0
they cheered and took photos as it crossed the blue sky			0
@entity107 , a veterans hospital x-ray tech , was there with his wife , @entity110			0
@entity111 stood on a bench along a campus street taking pictures as @entity107 and others whooped with joy			0
oh , my god , ' @entity107 said as it flew over			2
thursday 's flyover gives @entity7 a chance to honour @entity8 ' legacy as a long - time advocate for @entity43 human spaceflight , @entity7 spokeswoman @entity120 told @entity0 in an email			2
she said no additional costs would be incurred by honoring @entity13 's request			2
hundreds of people gathered wednesday to watch the shuttle land in @entity89 for an overnight stay , an exciting but bittersweet moment for many residents who felt spurned that @entity135 was n't chosen as the final home for one of the five retired shuttles			1
' i think that it 's the worst thing that they can do , rotten all the way , ' said 84 - year - old @entity143 , clinging to her walker just before @entity1 landed after flying low over @entity146 towns , @entity147 and then downtown @entity89 and its airports			1
last stop : @entity1 mounted on @entity7 's @entity150 ( @entity150 ) lands at @entity20 , @entity3 ahead of its final stop tomorrow smooth landing : the touchdown went well as the shuttle prepares to make the final leg of its journey tomorrow final journey : endeavour sits atop the shuttle aircraft carrier , flies over downtown @entity40 , @entity39 early today ; it is making a final trek across the country to the @entity162 in @entity21 , where it will be permanently displayed the incredible journey : the shuttle passed through @entity40 shortly after morning broke it 's the ultimate piggyback ride , and scores have asked what it 's like to haul a 170,000 - pound shuttle			1
' that 's a tough thing to answer , ' said pilot @entity171 , who will be in command when @entity1 performs an aerial tour over several @entity3 landmarks friday			0
' what do you tell somebody ? it 's different			0
' the noise decibels louder inside the shuttle carrier aircraft compared with a commercial airliner because the interior is hollowed out to keep it as light as possible			0
there are no galleys , overhead bins or even air conditioning			0
pilots have to be hyper - vigilant about the weather because moisture can damage the shuttle 's delicate tiles			0
built for @entity194 , @entity7 acquired the aircraft in 1974 and used it for test flights from @entity20 in @entity3 's @entity197 and ferry flights to the @entity199 in @entity200			0
the four current @entity7 pilots who can operate the modified 747 are ex-military aviators who split their time flying other planes including zero - gravity aircraft and @entity207 supersonic jets			0
@entity135 , partly made famous by @entity208 when he uttered the line ' @entity89 , we have a problem ' in the movie ' @entity213 , ' has long tied its fortune to a mix of oil and @entity7			2
astronauts train in the humid , mosquito - ridden city , and many call it home years after they retire			0
the @entity222 and an adjacent museum hug @entity224			0
@entity89 's bid for a shuttle was rejected after the @entity227 retired the fleet last summer to spend more time and money on reaching destinations , such as @entity232 and asteroids			1
instead , @entity89 got a replica that used to be displayed at the @entity199			2
' the one we 're getting is a toy			0
an important toy , but a toy nonetheless , ' said @entity240 , 54 , of @entity241 , @entity39			0
still , people came out in droves wednesday , waving @entity43 flags and toting space shuttle toys , cameras and cell phones			2
back - to - back delays in the ferry flight resulted in one day being cut from the @entity89 visit			2
after landing , the @entity1 rolled slowly in front of the cheering crowd			0
it circled and preened like a runway model , giving awed spectators an opportunity to take pictures from a variety of angles			0
' i want to go on it , ' said 3 - year - old @entity261 as he headed to the landing area with his mother and grandmother			0
the shuttle took off after sunrise thursday , riding piggyback on a jumbo jet			1
it stopped at @entity270 in @entity271 , @entity39 , before heading toward @entity16 and then on to @entity7 's @entity272 , @entity3			2
after spending a night there , the shuttle will head to @entity21 on friday			1
in mid-october , @entity1 will be transported down city streets to the @entity162 , its permanent home			0
@entity7 still plays a large role in @entity89 , and astronaut @entity278 , who lived on the @entity279 from june to november 2007 , encouraged people to focus on a new era of space exploration			1
' the shuttles are a wonderful legacy , a huge part of @entity89 , but now it 's time to look to the future , ' said @entity278 , who lives in the @entity89 suburb of @entity289			2
this is the last flight for a space shuttle			2
@entity292 will remain at @entity199 for display , and @entity294 already is at the @entity295 , parked at a hangar in @entity297 since april			0
@entity1 - the replacement for the destroyed @entity300 shuttle - made its debut in 1992 and flew 25 times before it was retired			1
it logged 123 million miles in space and circled @entity69 nearly 4,700 times			1
resting zone : the vessels sit on the tarmac at @entity307 in @entity308 , @entity39 in the late evening hours of september 19 before departure for @entity3 going west : space shuttle @entity1 , bolted atop a modified jumbo jet , makes its departure from the @entity199 in @entity312 , @entity200 happy trails : the 747 leaves a slight trail in the sky as it passed through @entity89 last night hello @entity89 : the space shuttle endeavour atop its carrier craft flew over the @entity39 city yesterday			1
