producer says the pair would only use them when the car park 's owner gave permission by @entity7 reporter last updated at 6:34 pm on 2nd august 2011 the executive producer of @entity9 has apologised after the show 's presenters got into hot water again with viewers - and this time for parking in disabled bays			1
on sunday night 's episode @entity16 and @entity17 tried out electric cars by driving them to @entity21 , @entity22 , where they pulled into a car park to discuss the merits of the motors			1
but instead of using standard parking spaces , the road hogs parked in spaces for disabled bays			0
scandal : @entity9 presenters @entity16 and @entity17 have driven into trouble yet again for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show during the slot about electric cars , @entity16 - driving a £ 31,000 @entity40 - and @entity17 may - driving a £ 33,000 @entity41 - discussed the merits of non-petrol cars , asking ' should you buy an electric car ? ' after parking up in the disabled bays the pair laughed and joked about the costs of the cars and the electric motors - which are capable of a top speed of up to 90mph			1
they also joked about the luggage space and how electric cars had to be fitted with special windscreen wipers which make barely any noise			1
but it was only when they started to walk away did shocked viewers realised where the pair were parked			1
@entity61 responded to complaints by penning an explanation on the show 's blog			1
he said the programme makers had permission to use the bays for ' a quiet spot to film in ' and there were three other unused bays available all the time			1
he pleaded with disgruntled viewers to vent their fury at producers , rather than the presenters who are renowned for making controversial remarks and pulling stunts			0
typical : rather than parking in normal parking bays , @entity16 and @entity17 parked in spaces reserved for disabled people , sparking outrage among disability groups ' for those who are cross with us , please direct your anger towards myself and the production team , rather than at @entity16 and @entity17 , ' he wrote			0
' both presenters expressed deep concern to the film crew and me about using the disabled bays prior to filming , because of the disrespectful impression it would convey			0
' they only capitulated when we assured them the parking had been approved by the owner , and that the disabled bay markings would not appear on television			2
' this was our fault , not theirs , and we unreservedly apologise to all the viewers we have upset as a consequence			2
' it was the latest in a string of apologies the @entity108 have had to issue over the programme			0
controversial : it is just eight months since the team sparked a diplomatic incident by poking fun at @entity114 earlier this year , the @entity108 apologised to the @entity114 ambassador over remarks made by @entity16 , may and co-host @entity117			0
in the episode , broadcast on january 30 , @entity117 joked that @entity114 cars reflected national characteristics , saying they were ' just going to be lazy , feckless , flatulent oaf with a moustache , leaning against a fence asleep , looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat '			2
may described @entity114 food as ' like sick with cheese on it ' and @entity16 predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because ' at the @entity114 embassy , the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this ( snores )			0
they wo n't complain , it 's fine ' .			0
