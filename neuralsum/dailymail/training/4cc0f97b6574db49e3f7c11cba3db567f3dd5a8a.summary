an examination of the 3ft by 4ft window from which mrs @entity2 fell seemed to contradict police claims that she ‘ stumbled and lost her footing ’ in the early hours of august 17			1

the flat ’s owner , @entity61 , said : ‘ the only way out of the window is if someone climbs out or is pushed			1
there is no way it was just an accident			2

' she said she wanted to stay for three nights with her husband and sons			1
on the second night of their stay i got a phone call in the middle of the night saying there had been a terrible incident , with mrs @entity2 falling head first on to the street below			2
an examination of the flat by a @entity38 reporter makes a mockery of police claims that mrs @entity2 stumbled from the third floor window ( left ) as there is a waist high balustrade to prevent people from falling death fall : @entity25 died four days after his wife when he fell from a second - floor balcony at a luxury hotel ‘ there had been a furious argument heard by neighbours a few minutes beforehand			1

she had no clothes on except underwear			0
‘ a few minutes later the husband appeared to check her pulse			1
he quickly made his way back up to the flat			0
’ but last night mrs @entity2 ’s brother - in - law said the couple ’s sons denied there was any argument and insisted the holiday was ‘ entirely amicable ’			0
@entity135 said : ‘ it was @entity137 so there was a great deal of noise around the building			0
someone was banging on the door downstairs			0
‘ @entity2 leaned over and told them to go away			0
there was an awning halfway down , so she had to lean quite a long way out to see over it			0
‘ as the police said , some wooden bar on the window broke and she fell			2
’ about the suggestion there had been an argument prior to her death , mr @entity135 added : ‘ these reports are utterly and totally untrue			0
they are also extremely hurtful to the family , particularly to the boys			0
