this was the tumble that shook the internet , the fall that was bigger than the £ 5 million show itself , and quite possibly the ultimate wardrobe malfunction			1
after a 20 - year absence from the @entity9 , @entity7 stooped to conquer — by falling off the stage			1
the extraordinary spectacle of the singer , worth £ 520 million , being thrown to the floor at the @entity16 music industry ’s flagship award ceremony this week will surely go down as one of the most bizarre episodes in pop history			1
she was heard landing with a deep ‘ thud ’ by all sitting near the stage			1
for a moment , as the backing track continued to play , there was stillness and silence			2
and then the @entity22 , 56 , rose , climbed the stairs again and resumed singing , completing her routine with remarkable aplomb			2
sure , there was an extra kink in those @entity49 curls , and the vocals were not perfect , but , dignity aside , she seemed essentially none the worse for wear			2
and in getting up and embodying the ‘ show must go on ’ spirit , she was instantly lionised and hailed as an ‘ icon ’ by fans across the globe			1
radio 1 breakfast dj @entity58 , a barometer of cool , tweeted : ‘ @entity7 come party with us — i ’m gon na @entity58 — you can vogue			1
do not bring the bloody cape			2
’ indeed , far from a disaster , the incident has provided a welcome burst of publicity			1
in its wake , not only has # madonnafall been trending worldwide ( bringing her to the attention of the internet generation who have not , until now , been buying her music ) , but her single living for love has shot to the top of the @entity80 chart from its previous position well outside the top 100 , while the @entity84 reported yesterday that sales of her greatest hits album , @entity87 , rocketed by 62 per cent			1
and despite presenters @entity89 joking after the show that they were sitting with the star in @entity92 , the performer herself is absolutely fine			2
actually , and this may seem curious , @entity7 made such a speedy recovery that she was well enough to plug her album , and pay thanks to her fashion designer friends , immediately after the show			1
@entity7 begins her performance , dressed as a matador and flanked by dancers 2			1
her cape is tugged backwards by a backing singer , but the star seems unperturbed 3			1
as she starts to fall , a dancer is already vaulting to the floor			2
was it all choreographed ? 4			0
as she lands , dancers are waiting crouched around the back of the podium ‘ @entity35 hooked me up ! my beautiful cape was tied too tight ! ’ she wrote on @entity116			0
‘ but nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up ! thanks for your good wishes ! i ’m fine ! # livingforlove			0
’ it ’s enough to make one suspect that perhaps , just perhaps , this was a publicity stunt			1
conspiracy theorists were yesterday pointing out a few key peculiarities			0
first , close examination of the footage shows that just before she fell she was n’t frantically trying to unclasp the cape — which , you imagine , you would surely do if you knew it was about to be whisked off			1
instead she had her hands at her waist when she fell			2
photographs also show the star looked peculiarly calm as she tumbled ; no grimaces or shrieks			0
indeed , in some images , traces of a smile seem to be playing about those tight features			0
@entity7 revealed a bare behind on the red carpet at the @entity145 earlier this month unlike her performance at the @entity148 music awards , the @entity145 , earlier this month , where she wore a buttock - baring corset , @entity7 also favoured a sensible pair of three - quarter length trousers — which will have made for a slightly more comfortable landing			1
perish the thought they were padded			0
might she , then , have planned it ? after all , the perfectionist that she is , @entity7 had spent two full days rehearsing her routine and performance at the @entity159			1
surely someone as thorough as she would have finessed the business of taking a cape off			2
intriguingly , at the very moment @entity7 toppled from the raised stage , the male dancers flanking her vaulted down , too , and artfully formed into a ring around her			1
viewed on video , they do not seem to be rushing to help her — their movements suggest a choreographed sequence			0
those whose faces are not obscured by bizarre horned masks do not appear unduly concerned			2
what ’s more , other dancers could be seen already crouching around the back of the podium before @entity7 fell , almost as if they meant to catch her			1
and what is to be made of the lyrics of the song ? as fans have noted , they seem to defy mere coincidence			1
‘ took me to heaven and let me fall down , now that it ’s over , i ’m gon na carry on , ’ she sang			0
‘ lifted me up , and watched me stumble , after the heartache , i ’m gon na carry on			0
’ showbusiness veteran @entity188 , who has spent decades covering @entity7 ’s performances , said : ‘ you would have thought it would be easier for @entity7 to just show her a * * for publicity — but she did that at the @entity145 ’s , did n’t she ? perhaps this was all that was left			1
she is such a perfectionist that you know she will have rehearsed every last second of that performance , which makes it seem even more unlikely that it could be anything but deliberate			0
’ it is a view shared by hundreds of @entity206 users			0
one wrote : ‘ who else thinks the @entity7 fall was planned ? ’ another : ‘ i think it ’s staged			1
it gets a lot of publicity and sympathy			2
’ musician @entity215 tweeted : ‘ the more i watch that video , the more i think it ’s the greatest pr stunt of all time			0
new single out & everyone talking about @entity7			1
’ but if it was a stunt — albeit one that perhaps went slightly awry , with the singer hitting the floor more heavily than planned — what did @entity7 hope to prove by it ? oops she did it again ! @entity7 's attention grabbing smooch with @entity229 in 2003 @entity7 pictured under cover - for once - in a niqab last year a flash of the old @entity7 on stage in @entity233 , also in 2014 if nothing else , observers say the brief break in her vocals showed that she was not miming — an accusation she has faced in the past — although a fairly strong backing vocal could still be heard			1
publicist @entity241 tells me : ‘ this was a massively important night for @entity7 and she had her whole international team there			1
it was a huge event , her first time at the @entity248 in 20 years			0
she will not have wanted anything to go wrong			0
there was a lot riding on this performance after @entity253 was accused of not playing her single			2
she needs to convince the @entity256 generation to buy her music			0
that was what her performance there was all about			0
’ @entity7 pictured arriving at @entity261 in @entity262 last night for @entity7 has been suffering from a brutal law of diminishing returns when it comes to recent album sales			1
her last studio album @entity267 in 2012 sold a relatively measly 1.8 million copies worldwide — even though she ’d worked with the hottest young producers and embarked on a publicity blitz			2
you have to rewind ten years to 2005 to find her last big hit album , @entity273 , which sold 12 million copies			0
the signs are that her new album @entity277 is going to continue the slide			0
no wonder she was so desperate for attention at the @entity145			0
it must be acknowledged , however , that @entity7 is the mistress of the publicity stunt over a 32 - year career			1
often hailed as the queen of reinvention , she is ruthless when it comes to scheming her next shock			2
a brief history of her greatest stunts includes countless displays of vulgar provocation , from the release of her ‘ coffee table ’ @entity295 book in 1992 to wearing a niqab in 2014 and baring her breasts again for a magazine last year			1
even in the @entity299 years — when she tried to reinvent herself as the respectable wife of a film director — she did n’t stop , kissing @entity229 on stage in 2003			2
as she has aged , she has sought to portray some of the attention - seeking as a bid to fight ageism — a sort of grey crusade with porn imagery thrown in			0
she said : ‘ they ’re judging me by my age			0
but i do n’t follow the rules			0
i never did , and i ’m not going to start			0
’ as she says in this month ’s @entity317 magazine : ‘ my nature is to provoke , that ’s true			0
i ca n’t help myself			0
but it ’s always with good intentions			0
’ her good intentions in @entity262 this week are probably best defined as intending to do herself some good			0
but the question is , was this the publicity addict ’s most desperate stunt yet ? strictly no win no fee , of course ! beware : possible publicity stunt ahead all aboard the stairlift to the stars inspired by @entity331 's film			1

@entity7 's tumble made *headlines* and she was hailed as an ' icon ' by fans
it will surely go down as one of the most bizarre episodes in pop history
but the singer has a history of bizarre and outrageous publicity stunts
some have suggested her tumble was *cynically* organised beforehand
since she fell from the stage , her flop single has rocketed up the charts
