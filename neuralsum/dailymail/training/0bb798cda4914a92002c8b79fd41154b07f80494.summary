by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:23 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 22 march 2013 families where both parents work will be given £ 1,200 a year per child from 2015 to help with nursery fees , the government confirmed in the @entity8			1
but the policy has been called ' nanny subsidies for the well - heeled ' as mothers who choose to stay at home to look after their children will receive nothing			1
the childcare tax break is only for parents who both go out to work and earn a joint income of up to £ 300,000			2
many middle - class single - earner families on £ 50,000 have already had their child benefit taken away			2
describing the scheme as ' a slap in the face for two million stay at home mothers ' @entity37 of the campaign group @entity32 said it was ' completely incongruous ' to offer tax breaks to working families on nearly £ 300,000 while taking child benefit from single - earner families on just £ 50,000			1
others expressed frustration that the @entity2 had failed to introduce a married couples ' tax break – something which was promised in the conservative manifesto			0
ministers said they hoped the new scheme would encourage low and middle income earners to work full - time			2
they claimed many women are put off going back to work after having children because of the costs of childcare			0
but campaigners have described the scheme as ' a slap in the face ' for stay at home mothers			2
the new childcare subsidies have also come under fire for delaying assistance until autumn 2015			0
@entity21 insisted the policy would help 2.5 million families , including those whose employers are not part of the existing childcare voucher scheme			1
@entity73 and @entity74 with daughter @entity75 , four months old , from @entity76 , @entity77 new parents @entity78 and his wife @entity80 have welcomed the new child care tax break			1
the benefit , worth £ 1,200 per child per year , will enable mrs @entity74 to return to work full - time rather than part - time			1
mrs @entity74 is currently on maternity leave after having @entity75 , who is four months old , but she is keen to get back to her job			0
the 34 - year - old works as a manager of a community safety team for @entity90 and earns £ 46,000 a year			2
her husband also earns £ 46,000 a year as a service manager of a sports department for @entity90			2
although the couple normally earn a combined income of nearly £ 100,000 a year , they are still entitled to receive child benefit of £ 81 a month			0
and now with the added benefit of subsidised childcare , the couple will be even better off			0
mr @entity78 says : ' one of our biggest worries is childcare so any relief is great			0
' @entity80 is currently on maternity leave , but is supposed to be going back to full - time work in november , which means she would have taken a year off if we can afford it			2
' mr @entity78 says that if the £ 1,200 a year tax break had been introduced sooner than the proposed 2015 date , his wife probably would have returned to work sooner			1
instead she will spend the next few months being a full - time mother to her young son			0
mr @entity78 said he thought the new scheme would probably encourage some people to not take their full maternity allowance on a lower pay			0
he also said it will help his wife work full - time in two years time when @entity75 is two - and - a - half and the scheme is introduced			2
he added : ' the extra money means the difference between going back part - time and going back full - time			0
' it would take the pressure off for us			0
' as public sector workers , both mr @entity78 and his wife have had a pay freeze for the last two years which is to be extended for another two years			1
the couple have savings in @entity132 with @entity133			0
' to the working parents struggling with the costs of childcare and the mother wondering whether it makes financial sense to get a job , we offer this : tax free childcare , ' mr @entity21 said			2
but others pointed out that those with children older than five , or families with stay - at - home parents , usually mothers - will miss out , meaning 860,000 families with children will not benefit			1
earlier this week a government briefing document , claiming that mothers who stayed at home did not need as much financial support as those who work , was published on the @entity155 's website			0
the document , which was later removed , fuelled claims that the new childcare scheme is discriminating against the traditional family			0
to lift @entity162 out of the economic mire , the chancellor 's @entity160 unveiled measures aimed at restoring the ‘ @entity165 ’ of the @entity166 1980s			1
they included : the most eye - catching measure was the ‘ help to buy ’ scheme for those struggling to find mortgage deposits			1
it will mean £ 3.5billion becoming available for shared equity loans worth 20 per cent of the value of a new build house worth up to £ 600,000			0
other measures included a new flat - rate state pension worth £ 144 a week and a £ 72,000 cap on elderly care bills			1
automatic pay rises for public sector workers paid simply for time served will be scrapped , with only the armed forces exempted			1
public sector workers will also have to pay more in national insurance contributions			1
@entity187 and his wife @entity188 , from @entity189 , with their two children @entity187 believes he and his wife @entity188 , a stay at home mother - of - two , have been penalised for having ' traditional @entity166 values '			1
they lost out on around £ 2,000 a year in child benefit because mr @entity187 's business was bringing him in over £ 50,000 a year			1
now they have now been left empty - handed , while parents who both go out to work are handed tax breaks worth up to £ 1,200 a year towards the cost of their childcare			1
mr @entity187 , 43 , who owns a coffee roasters called pollards in @entity189 , said : ' last year we lost child benefit and we did n't mind as we believed we are all in this together			1
' but now i 'm on £ 50,000 as the sole earner and my family get nothing back from the government , unlike two people earning who would be thousands of pounds better off			0
@entity21 said this is a budget for hard workers			0
but a stay at home mum , who i believe is doing the most important job , presumably is not classed as a hard worker			0
' it would seem we are no longer in it together			0
' mrs @entity228 , 39 , gave up her job as an assistant head teacher to look after their two children , @entity233 , six , and two - year - old @entity234 , full - time			1
yesterday the @entity235 , the think tank started by @entity236 , criticised the government for undermining the traditional family by restricting help to dual income households			0
spokesman @entity241 said : ' introducing a transferable tax allowance would have gone some way to rectifying the state 's punitive treatment of marriage and one - earner families			1
' but channelling the hard earned taxes of one - earner families into nanny subsidies for the well - heeled , politicians and their working wives that represent the @entity253 have made matters profoundly worse			0
' @entity255 , from the social charity care , said the government 's help to two - income families ' will simply exacerbate the unfairness already experienced by single - earner households within the tax system '			2
he added : ' for one - earner households earning just over the average wage it is even more critical that the government honours its commitment to support them through transferable allowances , as promised in the @entity270			0
' @entity166 mp @entity271 said : ' i can see why families with one parent who stays at home doing a really important job would be disappointed , but i hope they will take some comfort from other measures in the @entity8 to help hard - working parents			1
' he added : ' i hope with the remaining two budgets in this parliament we get to see a return to the tax system supporting transferable allowances between married couples			0
' @entity288 , director of the centre - right @entity289 think tank said : ' the new tax relief scheme will also be broadly regressive , giving more to families on higher incomes than those lower down the income distribution			1
' it will leave the distribution of government funding for childcare with a u-shape : households on low incomes will qualify for tax credits and the better - off will qualify for tax reliefs , with less going to families in the middle			2
' as part of the reforms , the government is phasing out the current childcare voucher scheme , which offers tax breaks for working parents to help with the costs of after - school care for the under - 15s .			2
