when the new parliament met in @entity29 last week , it was officially opened with a military ceremony conducted by the @entity34 - @entity33 @entity32 battle group			0

@entity37 and other @entity11 turned their back as an orchestra performed the official @entity17 national anthem in the @entity9 parliament in @entity29 on tuesday july 1 the development comes after mr @entity37 accused @entity11 of descending into ' naked militarism ' by ' goosestepping ' the @entity9 flag around @entity2 at the opening of the @entity6 earlier this week			1
the @entity21 leader said @entity17 leaders were ignoring growing euroscepticism across the continent by pushing ahead with ' ever closer union '			2
