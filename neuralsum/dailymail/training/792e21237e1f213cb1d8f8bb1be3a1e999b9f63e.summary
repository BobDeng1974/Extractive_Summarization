by @entity0 a ‘ significant ’ number of the 2.5million trees lining @entity4 ’s rail network today faced being chopped down - in an effort to stop them being blown onto tracks during severe weather and causing delays			1
some 1,500 trees or branches fell onto the 20,000 - mile network last winter , which was the stormiest period of @entity4 weather experienced for two decades , according to a @entity16 report			1
about a third of these incidents resulted in collisions , with 430 cases of trains striking trees or branches over the winter - often significantly damaging trains and disrupting services			1
danger : some 1,500 trees or branches fell onto the 20,000 - mile network last winter , according to a report			1
pictured is a tree blocking the line at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , last december @entity37 's current policy on vegetation is to clear trees and bushes to 10ft ( 3m ) to 16ft ( 5m ) from the rail depending on line speed , and 11ft 6in ( 3.5m ) from overhead power lines			2
but the report said : ‘ this policy in no way adequately addresses the risk of trees being blown onto the line in high winds , or the damage they can do to the long term stability of slopes			2
‘ it is not clear to us that there is a defined budget for vegetation management … we consider that @entity37 needs to substantially strengthen its vegetation management policy			0
’ the report recommends that @entity37 develops a ten - year strategy to ' significantly ' reduce the number of lineside trees - but also offsets the loss of vegetation by planting trees further away			1
last winter @entity4 was hit by 13 major storms , including the @entity68 on october 28 , 2013 which hit an extraordinary 99mph at @entity70 at @entity71 on the @entity72			1
clearing the line : @entity37 has been advised to develop a ten - year strategy to significantly reduce the number of lineside trees - but also offset the loss of vegetation by planting trees further away most of the damage caused by that storm was associated with falling trees , which were still in full leaf at that time of year - and the tempest was within the ten worst to affect the @entity85 in 40 years			1
' it will not be possible to make our transport systems totally resilient - the forces of nature will still on occasions prove too powerful ' @entity92 , report author @entity37 believes that 25,000 of the 2.5million lineside trees with a trunk diameter of at least 5.9in ( 15cm ) are in a risk category - based on the likelihood of them falling , their location and size			1
former @entity101 chairman @entity92 , who authored the @entity102 , said : ‘ there is no silver bullet or instant solution to make our transport systems more resilient - instead it is a task of attending to 101 details			1
‘ but by prioritising our efforts , applying already good practices much more widely and ensuring that transport operators and authorities learn continuously from other 's experience as well as their own , there is much that can be achieved			2
report : former @entity101 chairman @entity92 ( pictured ) , who authored the @entity102 , said there is ' no silver bullet or instant solution to make our transport systems more resilient ' ‘ it will not be possible to make our transport systems totally resilient - the forces of nature will still on occasions prove too powerful			1
' but where there is disruption there is more that can be done to minimise its duration and impact , and to improve how passengers and road users are communicated with			0
’ ' the damage and disruption caused by fallen trees on the railway last winter underlined the need for a more proactive approach to the way we manage what grows along the tracks ' @entity37 spokesman the report came with 60 recommendations and also looked at the highways network , proposing for example that driving theory tests should have questions on how to cope with bad weather			2
a @entity37 spokesman told @entity155 today : ‘ the damage and disruption caused by fallen trees on the railway last winter underlined the need for a more proactive approach to the way we manage what grows along the tracks			2
‘ it ’s no coincidence that @entity164 , which was built to modern engineering standards with appropriate levels of trackside vegetation , was unaffected by the extreme weather			0
‘ our new vegetation management strategy seeks to strike the right balance between encouraging biodiversity on the railway and protecting the network from fallen trees , focusing on known high - risk locations			2
‘ as part of this strategy , we will be working closely with local communities and environmental groups to discuss how best to manage any significant reduction in lineside vegetation			0
’ keeping back : @entity37 's current policy on vegetation is to clear trees and bushes to 10ft ( 3m ) to 16ft ( 5m ) from the rail depending on line speed , and 11ft 6in ( 3.5m ) from overhead power lines however , a @entity190 spokesman told the @entity191 : ‘ cutting down trees by railways can cause damage , such as where mature woodland is established			0
‘ the railway network can also be an important corridor for wildlife , and clearance of trees along it should be part of a wider conservation plan			0
but in some places removing trees could help boost wildflower grassland			0
’ ' the railway network can also be an important corridor for wildlife , and clearance of trees along it should be part of a wider conservation plan ' @entity190 spokesman and @entity211 , the head of @entity213 investigations , told @entity155 : ‘ the habitat alongside the rail network could provide one of our greatest nature reserves			0
‘ over the last three years , we have been advising @entity37 and reminding them that clearing scrub and trees during the sensitive spring and summer nesting period may not only threaten nesting birds , but is also potentially against the law			0
‘ any removal of trees and dense vegetation should be undertaken sensitively with a programme of replacement planting , habitat creation and management - this could actually create many more homes for nature			0
‘ there seems to be a great opportunity here to dramatically improve @entity37 ’s estate for the benefit of wildlife , but this work needs to be planned ahead of time , to avoid threatening nesting birds and other breeding species			0
