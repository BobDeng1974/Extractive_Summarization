@entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , 1 day ago could we please find a way to prevent those with a history of domestic violence from owning a gun , or being able to buy one ? surely the law abiding , honest , and responsible gun owners do n't think this guy had a right to bear arms ! yeah , he could have stolen a gun , or he could have used a knife , but most of these tragedies wind up as shootings , where the abuser either already owns the firearm , or legally buys it for one purpose only			1
this country also needs to do more to protect the victims of domestic violence and find better ways of dealing with the abusers			2
@entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , 1 day ago what a lowlife , may the devil take his soul and burn it in hell for eternity			2
@entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , 1 day ago he looks mean			2
@entity190 , @entity153 , 1 day ago we must be able to do more for the children victims of domestic violence , it should not be up to the mothers or the fathers at some point			1
some victim parents are just not able emotionally to stand up to the abuser there needs to be some type of emergency intervention while the abuser is in jail to speak to the victim parent and assess the safety of the children should the abuser return to the home			1
i know this borders on privacy and a persons rights but children have a right to live in a safe environment away from a parent that can not protect them and from an abuser wanting to harm them			0
someone has to speak for the children			0
every county needs to address this issue as a high priority			0
