by @entity0 last updated at 11:02 am on 14th december 2011 @entity1 told the court how mr @entity3 had come home in a ' black mood '			1
he was acquitted of assault she has starred in cult movies , @entity10 intrigues and @entity12 sitcoms			1
but for ' face of the @entity17 ' actress @entity1 , her most dramatic role yet came yesterday in the more banal surroundings of @entity19 ’ court			2
the court in @entity22 heard a complicated tale of alleged affairs , domestic violence , a relationship breakdown , and an apparent suicide attempt			2
miss @entity1 ’s long - term partner , @entity29 - nominated film composer @entity3 , was facing a charge of assault after the actress , 48 , claimed the father of her young son had punched and slapped her during an argument about an alleged affair she ’d had with one of their mutual friends			1
in emotional scenes she told the court how their nine - year relationship had broken down , and that on april 9 mr @entity3 , 54 , had come home in a ‘ black mood ’ , they had argued about the alleged affair before he pinned her on the sofa and attacked her			1
in evidence ms @entity1 , 48 , had said : ' the relationship had broken down two years earlier but we kept trying to keep things better for our son			2
' that evening i came down stairs from putting my son to bed and @entity3 was in a very black mood			1
' he was in a really really dangerous mood and it started about money and the house and how little he would give us			2
it was getting heated and i was frightened			2
' he would pick me up and throw me down to the ground			2
at this point he would leave and that would be that but he came back and sat on the sofa			2
' and foolishly maybe because i was accustomed to these activities i sat on the sofa with him			2
' she said when @entity3 attacked her he threatened to reduce the amount she would get from the joint sale of their home			1
' he then used his weight against me , screaming ' did you like it ? ' and when i would n't answer he said - ' right that 's £ 100,000 off ' - and again ' did you like it ? - ' ok that 's £ 150,000 off			2
victory : @entity3 leaves court after being found not guilty ' and then i replied : ' yes i loved it ' and he started punching and slapping me repeatedly			1
' i tried to get him off at which point he flipped me over and started dragging me and i am desperately trying to hang onto the sofa			0
' i kicked him hard but he did n't stop until my son came down saying ' stop , stop '			0
' my child has memories no child should			0
thank god he came down			0
' @entity1 pictured with her long - term partner , @entity29 - nominated film composer @entity3 at the premiere of mr @entity99 's den but then mr @entity3 gave the court an entirely different version of events that followed a row over money when the actress allegedly tried to climb out of a window of their £ 1.7million @entity22 home , in an apparent suicide attempt			1
@entity3 told the court : ' the next morning we had a heated discussion about money , it was always about money			1
' there was this house she wanted but it was going up and up - it had become too much and i wanted to discuss it with her			0
' she was angry because it was unaffordable			0
actress @entity1 : she has appeared in the @entity12 's @entity122 and @entity10 's husbands and wives ' she ran to one window in our bedroom on the top floor and she put one leg and her head outside			0
i was terrified and i pulled her back in			0
' she then ran to the window in the bathroom and did the same thing straddling the windowsill			0
i managed to drag her back in			0
' i was preventing her from committing suicide			0
she was screaming and very volatile			0
i thought she was going to jump - it was distinct possibility			0
@entity1 : her claims were dismissed ' she then grabbed a wine glass , which was on the side of the bath , smashed it and began to draw it across her wrists			0
' i said - ' for @entity145 's sake you have a son what are you doing ? ' and she threw it at me and collapsed sobbing			0
' @entity3 then claims things calmed down between them and they had even shared a ' joke about having sex ' on a trip they were to take to a film festival in @entity157			1
he said she was ' driven by insecurity and jealousy ' in bringing the assault charge to court			2
following mr @entity3 ’s evidence , miss @entity1 changed her mind on the date of the alleged incident			1
mr @entity3 ’s defence barrister then applied for the case to be dismissed and the three magistrates duly found mr @entity3 not guilty of assault			1
magistrate @entity171 , threw out the case and said : ' we would expect the crown to clarify the date prior to the trial date			0
' former model miss @entity1 , has appeared in the @entity12 ’s @entity122 and @entity10 ’s @entity177			0
mr @entity3 has been @entity29 - nominated for his film scores , worked with @entity179 and @entity180 , and the wealthy couple lived in a four - storey @entity22 townhouse in north @entity22			1
but the wheels started to come off their relationship two years ago when miss @entity1 allegedly had an affair with one of their mutual friends			0
they had tried to repair things for the sake of their seven - year - old son @entity192 , but eventually mr @entity3 had moved out to a studio flat where he did much of his composing			1
they decided to separate and sell the family home , but mr @entity3 still visited regularly to see @entity192 and read him a bedtime story			1
but things became acrimonious as they argued about how much each side would get from the proceeds of the house			0
mr @entity3 will not face any further charges following yesterday 's ruling			1
miss @entity1 was ordered to pay defence costs and was denied a restraining order against mr @entity3			1
outside court mr @entity3 gave a thumbs up sign and said : ‘ the verdict speaks for itself			1

her partner @entity3 found not guilty of assault
