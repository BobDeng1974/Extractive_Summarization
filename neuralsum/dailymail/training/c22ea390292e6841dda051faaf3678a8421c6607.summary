@entity0 has been getting used to early exits at grand slams but rated his @entity4 loss to @entity5 as the most disappointing of the lot			1
having made 36 consecutive slam quarter - finals , @entity0 has failed to reach the last eight at three of the last four tournaments			1
the sequence ended at @entity11 last summer with his stunning second - round loss to @entity13 while he was then beaten in the fourth round at the @entity15 by @entity16			1
bowing out : @entity0 fell to @entity17 's @entity5 in five sets at @entity19 giant - slayer : @entity5 claimed the biggest scalp of his career by beating @entity0 in the fourth round in @entity24 , @entity0 came out on the wrong end of a five - set battle with @entity5 in round four , losing 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) , 6 - 2 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3			1
' for every match you ca n't necessarily explain why you lost , ' said @entity0			2
' sometimes you 're more disappointed , sometimes less			0
i 'm not mad , but i 'm not happy , either			0
because i missed too many opportunities			0
i did not play like i wanted to play			0
' this time i was in good shape , and i think i could have done better			2
that 's why i 'm probably even more disappointed this time			2
' @entity5 appears to have left his playboy reputation behind him , if not his penchant for causing controversy , and is finally living up to his considerable talent			2
from outside the top 130 in the rankings at the start of last season , @entity5 has climbed to a career - high 17 and is unbeaten in @entity41 this year having won titles in @entity43 and last week in @entity44			1
he said : ' it 's probably the most important win , especially because it was five sets			0
' i beat him before , but it was a three - set match			2
so for my confidence and just for me as a tennis player , a five - set win over @entity0 , it 's really big			1
' hard yards : @entity0 during his five - set round three match against @entity5 at the @entity4 wasted talent : @entity5 , from @entity17 , admits he has n't utilised his potential yet but is starting to impress at 25 next up : @entity56 is @entity5 's last - eight opponent after the @entity57 beat @entity58 on sunday the lightbulb moment for @entity5 came at a challenger tournament in @entity61 in @entity62 in november 2012			1
' i asked for a wild card , ' he said			0
' i did n't get the wild card			0
i had to play qualifying			0
i made the final there , so it was an okay week , but it was the end of the year and in the middle of nowhere			0
' it was winter , it was really depressing , and i thought , " i start to do something or for what i do this " ? so that was one big question			0
' @entity5 probably should have won the opening set but @entity0 fought back , and the outcome might have been very different had the @entity79 taken either of two set points serving at 5 - 3 in the second			1
on the first @entity5 admitted he got lucky as @entity0 sent a smash right to him , but three points later the @entity17 had the break back and he went on to win the set on a tie - break			1
another key moment came with @entity0 leading 5 - 2 in the fourth set			1
@entity5 went off court for treatment to his back and hamstring and , although @entity0 did take the set , his momentum had gone and a service break at the start of the decider ultimately cost him the match			1
@entity0 was suspicious @entity5 may have used the break tactically , saying : ' he did n't look hurt in any way			1
but if you can use it , you might as well do it			0
' @entity5 , though , insisted that was not the case			2
feisty : @entity5 shows the remnants of his racket after smashing it on the clay at @entity19 gracious : @entity0 congratulates @entity5 as his opponent goes on to face @entity56 in the quarter - finals ' i 'm not big on medical time - outs , ' he said			1
' i do n't like to take it , but i take it when it 's really necessary			0
it probably was my third medical time - out in my life			2
' the crowd willed their favourite @entity0 on , and @entity5 admitted the hostility towards him had curbed the wilder side of his personality - not withstanding one broken racquet			1
' one is nothing for me , ' said the 25 - year - old with a grin			0
the @entity17 moves on to play sixth seed @entity56 , who continued his impressive progress through the draw with a 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 win over @entity58			1
@entity0 will have a week to spend with his family before defending his title on grass in @entity137 and then moving on to @entity11 , where he believes he is a genuine title contender			2
he said : ' mentally i have already switched to the grass			0
' i think when i 'm healthy , like i have been now for the last six to nine months , i think clearly i can decide the outcome of the matches more than i could last year			0
so i 'm very excited about my chances for @entity11 now this time			0

@entity5 fought back from a set down to beat @entity0 in five sets
it comes two days after @entity0 reached the fourth round for a record 12th time
the @entity17 takes on @entity56 in the quarter - finals at @entity19
