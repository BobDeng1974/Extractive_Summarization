the @entity1 medal awarded to marines during their daring anti-pirate missions hundreds of @entity4 who tackled gangs of gun - toting @entity8 pirates on the high seas have been barred from wearing their medals after defence chiefs ruled that their missions were not risky enough			1
the @entity4 confronted pirates armed with @entity16 assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades in a series of daring engagements , blowing up their boats and seizing lethal weapons			1
the brave squaddies spent months on patrol before returning to the @entity24 , where they received a @entity1 medal recognising the success of their counter-piracy operations			1
but top brass have ruled they can not wear the gong on their uniforms			1
when they complained , the @entity4 were shocked to learn their battles fell foul of the ‘ risk and @entity35 ’ which states the risk to life and limb should exceed what might normally be expected of @entity24 service personnel			0
last night , furious lance corporal @entity42 , of the @entity4 ’ @entity41 , said : ‘ i believe that boarding a dhow [ pirate ship ] harbouring pirates who have been seen with weapons and have refused to stop even after we ’ve fired at them constitutes a risk			0
‘ this case does not just concern me and my group of 30 [ @entity4 ] but a large number of service personnel who have worked to protect innocent people and the world ’s economy from piracy			0
' at a time when morale in the @entity60 is low and with even more cuts to come , this ruling is another instance of the efforts of our forces being overlooked and under - appreciated			0
’ more than 250 @entity4 , members of the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and the crew of the @entity70 ship @entity71 served for three months at a time on @entity72 , a multinational mission to defeat pirates sailing off @entity8			2
from 2009 to 2013 the @entity4 faced heavily armed @entity8			2
@entity24 forces captured 108 pirates and destroyed 17 vessels			2
@entity79 sailors and @entity67 troopers also secured the release of 43 seafarers taken hostage – yet they are barred from displaying the @entity1 medal they were awarded			1
the authors connected the rise of piracy and maritime violence in @entity8 to battles over fishing rights			0
pictured is a ' skiff ' , a small boat frequently used by pirates , off the @entity8 coast the @entity1 medal , cast in bronze with a blue and white ribbon and the clasp ‘ @entity100 ’ , was also awarded to troops from the @entity102 , the @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
they are entitled to wear the medal			0
an @entity109 spokesman said : ‘ it is only right the highest standards are set when medals are awarded to recognise the risk and rigour our people face on operations			0
' that the @entity1 medal has not been approved for wear does not detract from the importance of these counter-piracy operations			2
