by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 5 december 2012 @entity2 founder and ceo @entity1 : his website now has more than a billion users , who are being asked to vote on a series of changes that the internet giant insists are ' housekeeping ' ahead of new product launches @entity2 's one billion users are voting on changes to the internet giant 's policy			1
if you have n't already voted , you have until next monday evening to register your views			2
but if 30 per cent of users do n't vote , all users will lose the ability to vote on any future changes			1
of those who have already voted , most are against the proposed changes			2
@entity23 , vice-president of communications , public policy and marketing , explained in a long post what the changes would mean			0
the main changes are to the way @entity2 can share your data with its partners , including the popular picture - sharing app , @entity36			1
@entity2 bought @entity36 for about $ 1billion ( Â£ 621million ) in april			1
@entity2 wants to be able to make changes to how it stores and shares information - including likes and comments - with advertisers and anyone else it is affiliated with			1
what worries privacy campaigners is the note from @entity2 that this information can include your views on sensitive issues such as health , religion or politics			1
however , the site 's guidelines make clear that advertisers are prevented from ' running ads that assert or imply sensitive personal characteristics , such as race , ethnicity , religion , and sexual orientation '			0
@entity2 also wants to end the process by which users can vote on changes			1
that is because of the explosive growth of the social networking platform			0
when the system was launched , asking for 7,000 comments in a week on a change seemed reasonable			0
now , that threshold is easily reached , but getting 30 per cent of the users - more than 300million people - to vote is much less likely			1
on previous occasions , voter turnout among users has nowhere near reached the level required			0
in june , just 342,632 people participated in a vote on data use policy , while in april 2009 , 665,654 votes were cast on a proposal at a time when the site had around 200million users			1
that means noisy minority voices can have too much influence over @entity2 policy			1
mobile advertising is an important move for @entity2 as more users check in using their smartphones than their desktop computers @entity23 said ' our goal in modifying our site governance process is to make sure that we receive feedback from you in the best , most productive way possible			1
' @entity2 also wants to change your ability to limit who can send you private messages			2
that could mean spam from advertisers in your inbox			0
@entity2 said it could n't comment on upcoming changes to the product			2
campaigners are urging @entity2 users to vote to keep the existing documents			1
doing so would prevent the changes from going through			0
however , a @entity2 spokesman warned that many of the changes covered in the new documents come from its regulator in @entity122			2
he said : ' if those could then be vetoed by the vote			0
. where would that leave us ? in violation of data protection laws			0
' the changes are more than just a nice to have			0
' we need to make them to stay compliant			0
' after its lacklustre stock market float , @entity2 has been keen to build its mobile advertising presence			2
until recently , those viewing the site via apps on their smartphones or tablets were seeing fewer ads , despite the fact that more posts were being made via mobile apps than from desktop computers			0
the internet firm 's third - quarter earnings showed that advertising revenues grew by 36 per cent on the same time last year to reach $ 1.08billion			0
of that - $ 139million - came from adverts shown on mobile devices			0
a @entity2 spokesman stressed that the changes the internet giant wants to make are ' housekeeping ' changes to prepare the way for new products to launch .			1

30 *%* of users - more than 300 million users - must vote to have effect
most of those who have voted are against the changes
@entity2 insists that changes are ' housekeeping '
