by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 12 december 2013 shadow chancellor @entity1 claimed last week that @entity3 's families are in the grip of a crisis standards of living in @entity3 have climbed to among the best in @entity8 – despite claims by @entity10 that the @entity3 still faces a ‘ cost of living crisis ’			1
families now enjoy the sixth highest quality of life in the @entity16 due to a steadily recovering economy since @entity18 came to power , official figures showed yesterday			2
the @entity3 is now tied with @entity20 and @entity21 in the living standards league table – ahead of @entity24 and the @entity25			1
the figures , recorded by the @entity27 , fly in the face of claims by @entity10 that @entity3 ’s families are in the grip of a crisis			1
shadow chancellor @entity1 last week said that ‘ for most people there is no recovery at all ’ and accused the government of having ‘ no real action ’ to raise living standards			1
amid jeering , he said @entity3 was experiencing ‘ the slowest recovery for over 100 years ’			0
@entity38 this week accused the prime minister of being ‘ utterly complacent ’ and ‘ in denial ’ about the rising cost of living – only to be told by mr @entity18 that @entity3 now has one of the fastest rates of growth among @entity46 economies			2
and despite fears by critics that the economic recovery is not trickling down to ordinary families , @entity47 said ‘ @entity3 ’s economic plan is working ’ amid the doubling of economic growth forecasts			1
the figures , compiled by statistics agency @entity56 , show that living standards have improved since 2011			1
@entity58 , a tiny nation of only half a million people , tops the list and is followed by @entity61 , which has seen its economy and exports boosted by the single currency			0
in 2011 , when its economy was still in the doldrums , @entity3 was tied with @entity24 in seventh place , and lagging behind @entity21			1
but the @entity21 , under socialist president @entity68 , have seen their standard of living flatline – while @entity3 has climbed			1
the quality of life table compiled by the @entity27 reveals the @entity3 economy is steadily improving life in the @entity3 is now 14 per cent better than the average across the 28 @entity16 member states , according to the figures			1
the worst countries are @entity79 – where living standards are 51 per cent worse than the average – and @entity83 , where they are 50 per cent lower			2
@entity85 and @entity86 , which are not members of the @entity16 , also enjoyed living standards that were well above the @entity16 average			2
the @entity27 said : ‘ in 2012 the standard of living in the @entity3 was joint sixth highest in the @entity16 with @entity21 and @entity20 , up one place from last year			1
’ its measurements include goods and services consumed by individuals , as well as other benefits from living in the @entity3 such as free healthcare and education			2
the figures relate to 2012 , but are likely to have increased further this year as the economic recovery takes hold			0
last week the government ’s independent forecaster said the economy will grow at 1.4 per cent this year – almost twice as fast as previously expected			0
the @entity104 also upgraded the outlook for next year from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent			0
both unemployment and inflation have also dropped			0
mr @entity38 has pledged to freeze energy prices if @entity10 wins power at the next election , in a move described as ‘ economic vandalism ’ and widely derided by industry experts			0
but in last week ’s @entity115 , the chancellor said @entity10 had been proved ‘ comprehensively wrong ’ in demanding an end to austerity and said the annual deficit would be eliminated by 2018			0
n the pay gap between men and women has widened for the first time in five years , figures reveal			0
the difference in wages is now 10 per cent – up from 9.5 per cent in a year			0
full - time male workers now get an average of £ 13.60 per hour , while a woman is paid only £ 12.24 , said the @entity27 .			0

figures released by the @entity27 give *weight* to chancellor @entity47 's claim that the ' economic plan is working '
@entity3 is tied with @entity20 and @entity21 in the living standards league table
*contradicts* shadow chancellor @entity1 's claim last week that families in @entity3 are in the grip of a crisis
