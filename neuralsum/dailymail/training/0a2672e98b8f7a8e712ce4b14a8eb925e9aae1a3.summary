almost 80 members of @entity2 are asking federal regulator to keep in - flight cell phone calls banned , calling the calls an outright hazard to a the safety of everyone on board @entity25 reports that the proposal is being viewed as a way to ' lift outdated rules			1
' but congressmen opposed to the change say there 's more to consider than just the technical aspects			2
in a statement written monday to the @entity33 , @entity34 , the @entity35 , and the @entity11 , the @entity28 detailed the many ways in which in - flight phone calls could be a hazard for passengers			1
' the nature of an aircraft cabin would make it impossible for passengers to remove themselves from loud or unwanted conversations and disputes , they wrote			0
' instead of focusing on required safety - related tasks , flight attendants may be forced to intervene in or mediate disputes between passengers on appropriate content and volume of voice calls , thus distracting their attention from other passengers and job responsibilities			2
congressmen warn the calls could aggravate nearby passengers unable to keep from overhearing the conversations and exacerbate the already tense environment of a cramped airplane ' additionally , when noise and distraction levels rise because of talking passengers , the ability to hear important safety announcements , either from the cockpit or cabin , will be impaired and crucial information may be missed , ' they concluded			0
lawmakers also worry that phone calls could aggravate an already tense environment			0
' arguments in an aircraft cabin already start over mundane issues , like seat selection , reclining seats , and overhead bin space , ' they wrote			0
' and the volume and pervasiveness of voice communications would only serve to exacerbate and escalate these disputes			0

@entity11 proposal could allow in - flight calls calling bans ' outdated '
*77* congressmen have *signed* off on a statement *criticizing* the proposal saying the calls could lead to fights and *intrude* on passenger 's *limited* *personal* space
