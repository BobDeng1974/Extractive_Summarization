@entity0 is now fighting for his place as @entity3 head coach @entity2 prepares to play him on the left wing against @entity5			1
@entity0 played in his preferred position off the main striker in friday ’s 3 - 0 victory over @entity9 at @entity10 , but @entity2 is preparing another experiment in @entity13 ’s @entity12			1
@entity0 , who missed the final three games of the season with @entity16 , is determined to prove he is one of the best players in the world in @entity20 this month			2
i have picked him because he is a very good player			0
‘ i am only prepared to talk about @entity0 as one member of my squad and a player who i hope will help us have a good @entity35			0
‘ if i say yes he is exceptional or no i do n’t think he is exceptional then i ’m wrong either way			0
there is a real obsession with @entity0 which i do n’t necessarily share			0

i do n’t share the obsession that he has to play this or has to play that			0
talking a good game : @entity2 speaks with dr @entity52 and sir @entity53 at training keeping an eye on things : @entity2 takes training ahead of @entity3 's friendly with @entity5 ‘ as far as i ’m concerned i look at the players at my disposal and decide what they need and what we need			1
then i expect them do it			0
’ @entity0 is desperate to figure among the stars at this @entity35 after failing to make an impact in 2006 in @entity66 and 2010 in @entity67			2
the @entity3 forward has yet to score at the tournament and has been working hard on his fitness to make sure he is in peak condition by the time the team face @entity72 on june 14			2
