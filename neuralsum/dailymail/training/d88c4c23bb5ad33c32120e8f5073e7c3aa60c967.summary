by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 25 january 2013 dr @entity1 has been performing this operation for five years it is a sexual quixotic quest that has frustrated couples for decades			0
the illusive @entity5 has proved an enduring mystery - sparking debate among doctors , some of whom claim the idea of the @entity5 is a myth			1
but now , for those who can locate their @entity14 , help is at hand as it is revealed that the sex lives of couples worldwide could be enhanced dramatically thanks to a single jab			0
the vaginal sub mocosal hylauronic acid injection - or g - shot - claims to improve women 's sex lives by pumping filler into their @entity5			1
and now an @entity26 clinic reports a 50 per cent boom in bookings for the surgical procedure , suggesting it really works			1
the jab , which costs Â£ 550 , temporarily increases the @entity5 's size to that of a 10p coin			2
dr @entity1 , of @entity34 in @entity26			2
has been performing this operation for five years			0
in the first three years she performed approximately 60 procedures and in the last two years she has seen a 50 per cent increase , with approximately 90 cases completed			1
the g - shot has an expected longevity of six months			0
dr @entity1 said she gets inquiries from younger women who do not need the procedure and see it as a fashion trend , but she does n't perform the procedure on them , deeming it ' unnecessary '			2
her usual clientele , who do benefit from the jab , include women in the 35 - 50 age group who have either given birth , changed with age or have embarked on a new relationship , perhaps with a younger man			1
dr @entity56 says women with ' stretching and age - related changes experience less tightness and friction ' and the @entity61 can help with this to a degree			1
the g - shot involves locating the position of the @entity5 and enlarging the area using a dermal filler			1
a speculum - like the ones used during a cervical smear test - is gently inserted into the vagina to access the @entity5			1
a hyaluronic acid dermal filler is then injected into the vaginal wall			1
dr @entity1 said she gets inquiries from younger women who see it as a fashion trend the dermal filler contains a local anesthetic to keep discomfort to a minimum			0
but the clinic also warns patients of the possible risks associated with the procedure			2
these include infection , urinary retention , painful intercourse , a ' sensation of always being sexually aroused ' - or no effect at all			0
along with all those risks , though , comes the hope of increased frequency and intensity of orgasm , especially for those who have not experienced vaginal orgasm before			0
along with many risks comes the hope of increased frequency and intensity of orgasm the ' lunchtime ' procedure can be completed in just half an hour			0
it is certainly proving a hit in @entity102 where women are rushing to the @entity104 for their fix			0
now , as the procedure becomes increasingly more widespread in the @entity107 , women will not have to fly so far afield to get the boost they have always wanted			2
@entity109 yes , yes , yes ! some women report the @entity5 leads to powerful orgasms the @entity5 , often called the @entity5 , is defined as a bean - shaped area of the vagina			1
some women report that it is an erogenous zone which , when stimulated , can lead to strong sexual arousal , powerful orgasms and female ejaculation			0
the @entity5 is typically described as being located one to three inches ( 2.5 to 7.6 cm ) up the front ( anterior ) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate			2
although the @entity5 has been studied since the 1940s , disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure , definition and location			0
a 2009 @entity107 study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective , based on questionnaires and personal experience			0
other studies , using ultrasound , have found physiological evidence of the @entity5 in women who report having orgasms during intercourse			1
it is also hypothesised that the @entity5 is an extension of the clitoris and that this is the cause of vaginal orgasms			0
sexologists and other researchers are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience the @entity5 , and emphasise that it is normal not to experience it			1

procedure involves injecting hyaluronic acid into the @entity5 to ' increase friction '
@entity26 clinic has seen 50 *%* boom in last two years
treatment *suitable* for 35 - 50 age group but women in their 20s still inquire
