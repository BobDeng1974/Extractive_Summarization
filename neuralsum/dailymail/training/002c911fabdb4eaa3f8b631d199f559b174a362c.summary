@entity0 produced an astonishing second - half fightback to stun @entity2 and claim a 4 - 2 victory at @entity4			1
the @entity0 , unbeaten since their opening day defeat at @entity6 , were awful during the first half and deservedly trailed to goals from @entity9 and @entity10			1
but quickfire strikes from @entity12 and @entity13 levelled matters early in the second half , before @entity16 and substitute @entity17 finished the job			1
@entity0 's second - half fightback saw the @entity0 claw back from a two - goal deficit to win 4 - 2 four goals in @entity0 's second - half fightback saw the @entity0 win 4 - 2 against @entity2 @entity2 : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ( @entity27 46 ) , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity28 , @entity29 ( @entity30 69 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 69 ) , @entity33 subs ( not used ) : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 bookings : @entity40 goals : @entity40 ( 4 ) , @entity10 ( 22 ) @entity0 : @entity42 , @entity12 , @entity16 , @entity43 , @entity12 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity17 46 ) , @entity13 ( @entity47 84 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 88 ) , @entity50 subs ( not used ) : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , bookings : @entity46 , @entity16 goals : @entity12 ( 54 ) , @entity13 ( 58 ) , @entity16 ( 71 ) , @entity17 ( 87 ) such an outcome had looked highly unlikely as @entity2 , challenged to prove their championship title credentials by manager @entity61 , raced out of the traps			1
inside a minute @entity31 had seen his goalwards glancing header hacked clear , but there was no reprieve for @entity0 in the fourth minute			0
@entity9 seized on @entity16 's loose pass and drove beyond @entity44 to send a left - footed drive into the bottom corner			2
it was the young midfielder 's second league goal for the @entity71 , almost three years after his first			0
the visitors were all at sea although @entity46 almost levelled with a curling strike which @entity22 did well to punch away to safety			0
@entity0 fell further behind in the 22nd minute			0
@entity31 played in @entity29 down the right , and his cross was expertly tucked home by @entity10			0
having dominated the opening half an hour @entity2 sowed the seeds of their own downfall by surrendering the initiative during the final 15 minutes of the half and , aside from one excellent @entity42 stop to deny @entity33 's volley , they were not to regain it			2
@entity2 's @entity10 doubles @entity2 's lead in the first half as @entity0 struggled to get a foothold @entity2 's @entity10 runs away in celebration after doubling @entity2 's lead over a frustrated @entity0 side @entity2 's @entity10 is joined by @entity29 as the pair celebrate going 2 - 0 up @entity2 let their 2 - 0 lead from the first half slip as a disastrous second 45 minutes saw @entity0 net four times the loss of @entity26 to injury weakened the left - side of the @entity2 defence , with @entity27 on in his place , and @entity0 took full advantage			1
firstly @entity13 was given far too much room to get a ball into @entity50 in the 54th minute			0
the in - form striker could not turn @entity25 but the ball fell kindly for @entity12 to slot home from close range , on the @entity113 's return to the side after his ban for pushing referee @entity116			2
four minutes later @entity0 were level			0
@entity48 evaded @entity9 and @entity27 to deliver a pinpoint cross for @entity17 to power a header straight at @entity22 , who could do nothing as @entity13 gleefully dispatched the follow - up			1
@entity2 were rocked and they fell behind with 19 minutes to play			0
@entity44 found space down the @entity0 right and @entity12 's mis - hit shot was turned in by @entity16 as @entity22 appealed in vain for offside			1
the @entity71 responded with @entity28 twice working @entity42 , and @entity16 being fortunate to only receive a booking after bringing down @entity32 with the substitute through on goal			2
but former @entity2 striker @entity17 put the result beyond doubt three minutes from time			2
splintering the hosts ' offside trap to round @entity22 before tucking home			0
@entity133 celebrates @entity0 's 4 - 2 win at the end of the game after clawing back from 2 - 0 down at half time			1

@entity2 went in 2 - 0 up at half time through @entity9 and @entity10
four different *goalscorers* for @entity0 in second half *confirm* 4 - 2 victory
@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity16 and substitute @entity144 @entity17 all net during an *incredible* second - half fightback
