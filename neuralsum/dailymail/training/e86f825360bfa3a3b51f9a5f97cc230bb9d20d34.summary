by @entity0 for @entity1 there 's always been suspicion that police had quotas to meet when it came to speeding fines , but now there 's proof			1
emails seen by an @entity10 newspaper have revealed that @entity12 police are in fact being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks , pressured to ' hammer ' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution			1
south @entity12 police have adamantly denied the claims saying there are ' no quotas ' only a benchmark model to ensure officers always maintained the ability to apply discretion			1

south @entity12 police have denied there are quotas for traffic fines saying only a benchmark model to ensure officers always maintained the ability to apply discretion			1
the @entity37 discovered that a sergeant from the @entity40 police station told staff in february this year that he 's expecting the senior sergeant to have some words			1
the emails read , ' we fell below our expected returns for traffic contacts for the last reporting period			2
we ’ll hammer those poor people who choose to drive when we ’re night shift			0
' again another email in may , from a different sergeant , showed police still had concerns with the figures they were seeing , acknowledging he was aware of the ' high caution rate '			2
' i understand it is the officers discrepancy , but for any of the ‘ fatal five ’ ( road safety issues ) ... strict enforcement should occur			2
' ' currently , @entity63 ( local service area ) is running at over 30 per cent cautioning			0
' an email to @entity12 police officer read , ' we fell below our expected returns for traffic contacts for the last reporting period			1
we ’ll hammer those poor people who choose to drive when we ’re night shift			0
' ' there are no quotas			2
i make no secret of the fact that we have broad road safety benchmarks			2
' said @entity12 police commissioner @entity80 in response to claims that police were given quotas , @entity12 police commissioner @entity80 released a statement saying he wanted to outline the facts regarding his letter to all staff in may about his expectations for road safety			1
' i want to take the opportunity to put on the record again - very clearly - that there are no quotas			0
however , i , and the executive , make no secret of the fact that we have broad road safety benchmarks			0
' these are not quotas			0
benchmarks are allocated to an @entity63 , branch or area to ensure they achieve a set number of traffic contacts , they are not allocated to individual officers			1
' ' preventing injury and fatalities on our roads through education and enforcement is a core function for @entity115 and must be addressed by all members as seriously as the prevention of crime and other core functions			0
' the commissioner said a benchmark model was key to ensuring members always maintain the ability to apply discretion			1
' for example , a driver committing a minor traffic breach could be issued with a caution or an @entity129			0
@entity130 is acceptable and is recorded as a " contact " and counted towards the benchmarks set for your area			0
emails seen by an @entity10 newspaper have revealed that @entity12 police are being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks , pressured to ' hammer ' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution			1
' i repeat - the benchmark process was deliberately designed to allow all members to use discretion			2
' ' the most important issue is that a driver who has done the wrong thing is spoken to and dealt with in some manner - documented caution , @entity151 , report or arrest			0
' ' the benchmarks are not onerous and are regularly reviewed			0
it is particularly unhelpful when members remain misinformed or are deliberately mischievous in the public domain			0
' ' i expect every operational member to enforce laws which influence driver behaviour and reduce the trauma on our roads - and i make no apology for it			0
deputy opposition leader @entity167 told @entity37 , police minister @entity168 must confirm whether the benchmarks that police were being required to meet were actually quotas			1
' if this is the case and officers are being required to meet quotas for traffic infringements , i am sure @entity176 will be rightfully annoyed and disappointed with the @entity177 , ' she said			1
' police officers want to be out doing their job and protecting the community			2
they do n’t want to be spending time filling quotas			0

a police sergeant told staff in february that he 's expecting the senior sergeant to have some words .
' there are no quotas , ' said @entity12 police commissioner
a benchmark *system* is in place for officers to use discretion
