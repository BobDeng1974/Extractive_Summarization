@entity1 's exams watchdog has been accused of wasting public money by assessing whether the new tests to replace gcses will discriminate against @entity5 , pregnant schoolgirls or teenagers having sex changes			1
the ‘ equality analysis ’ , commissioned by @entity16 at a cost of £ 2,400 , has warned that a number of pupils in these categories could be affected by the @entity13 ’s controversial overhaul of the exams			1
mr @entity1 announced plans earlier this year to replace most of the course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertake as part of their gcses with more rigorous end - of - course exams , to be known as ‘ i - levels ’			1
mr @entity1 announced plans earlier this year to replace most of the course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertake as part of their gcses with more rigorous end - of - course exams last year prime minister @entity30 declared that equality assessments were ‘ bureaucratic nonsense ’ and civil servants should employ common sense			1
but exam regulator @entity16 said it carried out the exercise to comply with the @entity38			0
it has spent over £ 5,000 on such assessments in the past year			0
last night critics condemned the new report as a waste of time and money , only highlighting hypothetical effects on a tiny minority of the 600,000 pupils who will sit the new papers			2
@entity50 , of the @entity51 , said : ‘ this is misplaced political correctness			0
we have been coping with exams from time immemorial			2
there are always going to be exceptions , and you ca n’t avoid them			0
’ mr @entity1 said he was introducing his exam reforms to push up standards mr @entity1 said he was introducing his exam reforms to push up standards because the current ‘ dumbed - down ’ gcses had become discredited			1
but the @entity16 equality analysis , drawn up by a company called @entity65 and published this month , warns that introducing a single , final exam worth 100 per cent of the marks could have an impact on teenagers who get pregnant while studying for gcses			1
it said schoolgirls who are expecting babies could struggle if the examination season ‘ coincides with any problems in pregnancy or is near the due date ’			0
concern was also raised in the 25 - page report that pupils undergoing ‘ gender reassignment ’ may be disproportionately affected			1
the youngest person to have a sex - change operation in @entity84 is reported to have been 17 , and fewer than 90 children and adolescents nationally are thought to be referred annually to the specialised gender identity services			2
however , the report says that reassigning a person ’s sex by ‘ changing physiological or other attributes of sex can be a prolonged process , rendering the pupil unavailable at crucial times not only for lessons but for exams unless alternative arrangements are made ’			2
the third group , @entity5 pupils , who make up less than ten per cent of those taking gcses , could also be disadvantaged if they happen to be fasting for religious reasons during the exams			1
@entity16 admitted in its main consultation document that the numbers involved were often small , but said it wanted to take all potential discrimination into account to see if alternative arrangements could be made			0
@entity16 said it was important to understand ‘ the potential implications of any significant proposals we make for different groups			0
‘ doing an equality analysis like this allows us to make decisions in a fully informed way , and also to meet our legal duties under the @entity38			0

course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertaken as part of gcses will be replaced with more rigorous end - of - course exams
some students - such as pregnant girls or fasting @entity5 - may be affected by timing of exams
