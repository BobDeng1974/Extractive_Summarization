the 46 - year - old tycoon aims to start work immediately linking the 17th century house to two adjacent properties			1
his £ 10million plan to refurbish the mansion has been met with fury from neighbours who have described the proposal 's approval as ' bad news '			0
estimates put the likely date for completion of the scheme to be at least three years away , but @entity26 owner @entity1 and his family will be elsewhere in @entity28 , far from the din as well as the uprooting of many trees on what was once an estate owned by @entity34			1
after months of a bitter planning battle with locals , @entity1 — acting behind the little - known @entity37 — has been told that @entity38 has decided to grant ‘ conditional permission ’ to develop the @entity40 - listed building , once owned by the artist @entity41 and , more recently home to late @entity44 minister @entity43			1
one of the chief objectors , who fears the renovation will blot out views of the @entity9 and create a chaotic building site , has informed other disgruntled residents : ‘ it seems that basically the whole proposal will be approved			2
this is probably bad news for all of us			0
’ particularly hard - hit will be residents of nearby apartments , whose complaints about losing their views of the @entity9 were airily dismissed in the committee ’s report			1
plans submitted to @entity63 and @entity64 show the size of the planned basement - the dotted lines show the footprint of the building at ground level there will be a sub-basement ( solid line ) under part of the main basement in answer to the objectors , the planners said : ‘ there is no right to a view in planning legislation			1
‘ the proposed development would protect the appearance of the building , would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and preserve the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building			0
’ part of the building will be converted into an art studio to house artwork he has bought with his partner @entity95 one member of the residents ' committee said : ' the battle may be lost , but the war is far from over			0
we are not going to accept all this lying down and hope that some of the main preservation groups will get on side when they see how genuine protest is being ridden over roughshod			0
’ the @entity26 owner decided to make the house in @entity26 his home after failing to gain permission to build an eight - bedroom house in nearby @entity112			1
his staff said yesterday that he aims to start work on the refurbishment project immediately after winning approval from @entity38 's planning committee			1
his new home is in a street where @entity121 singer @entity120 owns a house			0
fellow band member @entity123 has also lived in the street			0
the businessman aims to excavate beneath the @entity40 - listed house , which was once home to artist @entity41 , to create a two - storey basement			2
he is also going to convert part of the building into an art studio to house his collection of valuable modern paintings that he has bought along with his 31 - year - old partner , @entity95			1
he has only won permission for the project after making a series of compromises , which were forced on him by neighbours anxious at possible loss of light and increased traffic			2
one opponent , dr @entity143 , warned the venture was ' totally out of character with the surrounding buildings on this famous historic site			0
' he added : ' it will be an unsightly fortress - like building , spoiling the outlook for neighbours			2
' the red parts of the drawing show parts of the building that will be demolished as part of the plan the view of @entity159 where mr @entity1 intends to live from across the @entity9 another neighbour @entity160 , said the scheme would ' severely damage the character and look of the house			2
' but mr @entity1 's architects promised planning officials the renovation would turn the property into ' a beautiful and meaningful contemporary home '			0
he and his wife and three - year - old son @entity171 are currently living in a @entity63 house they own			1
three years ago , the businessman bought two adjacent buildings in @entity176 , @entity28 and revealed he aimed to turn them into a single eight - bedroom home			2
but he had to abandon this venture as part of the complex was @entity182 - owned and because of time delays			0
among his neighbours is @entity120 ( left ) while late @entity44 mp @entity43 used to live in one of the houses			0

given permission to build home after three - year battle with planners
neighbours *unhappy* with the plans that will block the view of the @entity9
billionaire @entity26 owner hopes to start work on the project straight away
