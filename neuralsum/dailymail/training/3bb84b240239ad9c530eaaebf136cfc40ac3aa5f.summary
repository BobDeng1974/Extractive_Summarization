by @entity0 for @entity1 it is easy to imagine that prehistoric hunting tools did not pack much of a punch compared to modern weaponry			0
but scientists say that stone spear points used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago , are comparable to bullets that expand on impact because they create large ‘ wounds ’			1
they think that the use of stone tips had a large impact on human evolution because it allowed early humans to hunt large animals effectively			1
scientists at @entity21 fired wooden and stone - tipped spears ( pictured ) - similar to those used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago - into gelatine to examine the nature of the impact experts tested stone - tipped and sharpened wooden spears and found that both had the same penetrating power			1
however , the stone point caused far more damage and was likened to the hollow - nose or ‘ dum - dum ’ bullet that expand on impact and are more destructive than regular bullets			2
the study involved shooting six stone - tipped and six sharpened wooden spears into gelatine and examining the degree of penetration and damage they produced			0
scientists fired stone - tipped spears into gelatine and found that created a significantly larger and wider ‘ wound ’ cavity			1
the cross-bow set up is pictured top , the gelatine bottom left and the target , bottom right compared with wooden spears , the stone - tipped weapons made a large ' wound '			2

dr @entity64 said : ‘ humans with stone - tipped spears were more likely to kill the game that they targeted , and were able to secure high quality food resources more frequently and regularly			0
’ all were fired from a cross-bow with the same amount of force			0
scientists found that the stone - tipped spears created a significantly larger and wider ‘ wound ’ cavity			1
dr @entity64 , of @entity21 , said : ‘ hafting a stone point to the end of a spear was an important innovation that changed life for @entity79 humans			0
‘ humans with stone - tipped spears were more likely to kill the game that they targeted , and were able to secure high quality food resources more frequently and regularly			0
’ up - grading spears with stone tips may have had a major impact on human evolution , according to the study , published in the journal @entity88			2
the reserachers said that it took our ancestors time and effort to prepare and assemble a spear with a stone tip. while they broke more frequently than sharpened wooden points - which could be dangerous when faced with a large angry animal – early humans seemed convinced that stone - tipped spears were a good idea , the experts said			2
@entity100 said : ‘ putting a fragile stone tip on a spear is risky , but we show that there are serious rewards in terms of both the size and shape of the wound created that made this innovation extremely worthwhile during our evolution			0
’ the researchers said that the manufacture of stone - tipped spears is thought to have been passed from generation to generation			0

in the same way , hollow - nosed bullets that expand on impact ( pictured ) are more destructive than regular bullets			0
the use of stone tips had a large impact on human evolution because it allowed our ancestors to hunt large animals up to 500,000 years ago ( illustrated )			1
