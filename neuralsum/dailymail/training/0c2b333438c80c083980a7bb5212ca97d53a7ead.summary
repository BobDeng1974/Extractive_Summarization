by @entity0 an @entity2 geologist has claimed that sightings of @entity4 in the dark waters of @entity6 are the simply result of bubbles caused by geological forces			1
dr @entity10 believes that there is no shy and ancient monster residing in @entity13 's most famous @entity6			1
popular opinion is divided about whether a surviving plesiosaur lives in @entity6 or whether the modern myth of the monster is the result of a string of elaborate hoaxes			2
the geologist , from the @entity22 in @entity23 , said that historical descriptions of the monster often include details of the earth shaking			1
dr @entity10 said that historical descriptions of the monster often include details of the earth shaking			1
he claims that sightings of the monster are linked to bubbles rising from the bottom of the loch caused by seismic activity along the @entity38 fault system , which runs beneath he claims that sightings of the monster are linked to bubbles rising from the bottom of the @entity6 caused by seismic activity along the @entity38 fault system , which runs beneath			1
although people may not associate @entity13 with earthquakes , @entity10 said that the fault line is ' very large and very active '			1
the geologist told @entity2 newspaper , @entity45 : ' there are various effects on the surface of the water that can be related to the activity of the fault			1
' dr @entity10 points to an old biography about @entity53 , written by @entity54 , that says the monster appeared and disappeared when the earth shook			1
written in @entity59 , the text describes a story about the saint crossing the @entity62 when his disciple is attacked by a monster and is saved when he asks for the protection of god			0
many people have noted that the description is very vague and mentions an ' unknown beast ' with a loud roar			0
it does not support any scientific explanation as there are no bubbles or mention of an ancient monster dwelling in the loch itself			2
one theory about @entity4 is that the monster is a surviving plesiosaur			0
the long - necked reptiles were found all over the world during the @entity85 period			0
there are believed to have become extinct in the @entity88 period the description also does not make any reference to any previous monster sightings , but it is the mention of the earth shaking that interests dr @entity10			1
he said that there were a number of reported sightings of @entity4 in the 1930s that coincided with seismic activity along the @entity38 fault line			1
' i think it â€™s an obvious description of what really happened ... with increased activity of the fault , in reality people have seen the effects of the earthquakes on the water , ' he said			2
he believes that his theory can be applied to over 3,500 @entity4 sightings			0
geologists said that there have been earthquakes in the @entity6 area measuring between 3 and 4 on the @entity115			0
the largest earthquakes were recorded in 1816 , 1888 , 1890 and 1901			0
unlike dr @entity10 , some geologists have said that earthquakes did not coincide with the explosion of @entity4 sightings in the1930s			2
they have also claimed that @entity13 's most violent earthquakes were too weak to cause noticeable ripples of the surface of the loch			0
the @entity2 geologist has been careful to point out that he believes the value of his hypothesis lies in making geologists aware of the geological origin of some popular myths			2
he has also claimed that the mystery of the @entity133 is caused by sulphur gas			0
there are many theories about the existence of a @entity4 , which have spawned famous images such as the one pictured			0
one of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon , which can grow up to 12 feet long			0

@entity2 geologist dr @entity10 says monster sightings often include details such as the earth shaking
he claims sightings are linked to seismic activity along the ' very large and very active ' @entity38 fault system , which runs beneath the @entity6
fault line makes bubbles rise to surface , *suggesting* activity from beneath
