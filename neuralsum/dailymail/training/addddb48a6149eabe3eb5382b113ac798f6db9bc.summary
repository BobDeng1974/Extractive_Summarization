former @entity1 cricket star @entity0 said aid money was being used to make the wealthy wealthier @entity6 aid money is being used to line the pockets of wealthy @entity1 with links to the country 's corrupt regime , minsters have been warned			1
former cricket star @entity0 said @entity1 politicians were syphoning off cash from the multi-million pound budget handed over by the @entity14			1
mr @entity0 , head of @entity1 's @entity16 opposition party , said the cash was going to those who did not need it and ' never reaches ' deserving people			1
the remaks , to the @entity22 on sunday newspaper , come after a report revealed aid spending had done nothing to help the economic and political freedoms of people in the countries which get the cash			1
it examined the progress of 28 countries which have had a share of the aid financed by @entity6 taxpayers and found that the money ' does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries '			1
the report produced by the @entity43 found that twice as many countries lost freedoms after receiving @entity6 aid than improved the political and human rights conditions for their citizens			1
mr @entity0 's remarks are likely to further deepen suspicion of aid spending among @entity53 right - wingers who are unconvinced by @entity55 's commitment to increasing the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of gross national income			1
the pledge pushed aid spending close to £ 12billion last year and means further sharp increases over the next few years			2
the prime minister has given his personal support to a @entity65 - backed private member 's bill which would write the 0.7 per cent target into law – a decision which means mr @entity55 faces the prospect of seeing many of his backbenchers vote against him			0
@entity1 is one of the biggest recipients of @entity6 aid			1
up to £ 310million is being handed over in the next year , dwarfing last year 's £ 253million			0
but mr @entity0 warned that in @entity1 , corrupt politicians ' have made millions through kickbacks '			1
the country is rated 37th out of 174 countries on the corruption index			0
the former cricket star told the @entity22 on sunday : ' they are filling their own pockets			0
@entity14 and others have played a big role for us but the money has to be used honestly			0
the @entity6 government and other donors must have a major say in the implementation of proposed projects			2
' when i say the @entity14 money is misused , i mean our system is not using it rightly			0
the money must be used for welfare projects rather than making billionaires even more rich			0
' thousands of @entity1 took to the streets this year calling for prime minister @entity97 to step down amid anger over corruption			2
but mr @entity97 's government continues to receive millions of pounds in @entity6 aid money countries : @entity103 @entity104 @entity105 @entity106 @entity107 @entity108 @entity109 aid spend 2012/13 : £ 265million £ 218million £ 111million £ 85million £ 57million £ 5.6million £ 1.3million ( 2010/11 ) mr @entity0 added : ' this is the most corrupt government we have ever had so whatever they get from donors they will try to distribute among their family members or favourites			1
' we want more schools , hospitals , small businesses and employment opportunities			0
this government has to go if we want any change			0
' otherwise the money provided by the @entity14 and others will only help the rulers and never reach deserving people			0
they even bribe the media with this money			0
' billionaire prime minister @entity97 is facing accusations he stole from public coffers , while former president @entity133 was twice jailed for corruption — yet remains @entity1 's second - richest person			1
less than one per cent of the population pays income tax and only 30 per cent of mps contribute			0
a @entity14 spokesman said mr @entity0 's allegations were ' unfounded '			2
he said : ' strict financial checks and close monitoring mean aid money only goes to those who need it			0
' @entity6 aid is changing @entity1 for the better — for example , 400,000 girls in the @entity150 region alone can now go to school because of it			1
' ultimately , this work is in @entity6 's interest			2
a thriving , stable @entity1 will help safeguard against terrorism and be a trading partner for the future			2

@entity0 said @entity1 was abusing multi-million pound @entity6 aid budget
