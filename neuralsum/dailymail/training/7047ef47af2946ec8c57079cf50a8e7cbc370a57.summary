@entity1 ’s tenure as @entity3 manager started on a positive note as goals from @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 pushed @entity9 deeper into relegation trouble			1
the hosts had led through @entity13 ’s opener shortly before half - time , only for @entity6 to head @entity3 level almost immediately			1
having struggled to impose themselves for long spells , @entity3 slowly grew in confidence after the break with @entity21 ’s free - kick and @entity8 ’s late third putting them firmly in control			1
but they had to endure a nervy finale when @entity9 debutant @entity26 headed late on and @entity27 headed another @entity26 chance off the line and onto the bar in stoppage time to preserve the points			1
@entity3 's @entity8 fires the away sides third goal of the game against @entity9 @entity7 finds the back of the net for @entity1 's side at the @entity39 @entity7 celebrates in front of the traveling away fans following his goal against @entity9 @entity1 , who left his last job at @entity44 by mutual consent at the start of october following a lousy start to the season , was brought in to replace @entity49 in the aftermath of last weekend ’s 1 - 0 home loss to @entity52			1
he quickly ripped apart an under - performing team that had slumped dramatically from league leaders at the start of the campaign			0
five changes were made from @entity52 , incoming were @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity6 , @entity61 and @entity62			2
@entity63 , whose @entity65 side started the afternoon two points above the drop zone , replaced @entity68 with @entity70 loanee @entity69 and @entity71 with @entity72 after last weekend ’s miserable loss at @entity74			2
@entity1 enjoyed the perfect start away at @entity9 as @entity76 looks on at the @entity39 @entity3 's @entity6 leaps highest to score his teams first goal of the game with a header @entity1 , wearing a club - branded jacket and tracksuit bottoms , never sat down during the entire match , standing sentinel on the edge of his technical area and frequently bellowing instructions			1
with just a few days available on the training ground , defending set - pieces was one area clearly not yet refined			0
twice early on , @entity9 players were afforded too much space inside the penalty area but twice @entity3 survived			1
first , @entity94 headed across the goal and off target after rising completely unchecked to meet a @entity98 corner			0
@entity6 watches on as he waits for the ball to nestle in the net at @entity9 's @entity39 then , on the quarter - hour , more slack marking from a @entity98 delivery allowed dunk to leap at the back post and @entity59 had to claw it to safety at point - blank range			1
@entity9 looked much the brighter going forward , with @entity109 supporting the attack at every opportunity and @entity112 looking lively after he replaced the injured march early on			2
@entity113 fired over the bar from just inside the box after @entity116 had shifted the ball to him before a @entity98 free - kick from about 25 yards out cracked the top of the post with @entity59 well beaten by its swerve			0
@entity6 cups his ear as @entity3 turn up the pressure against @entity9 at the @entity124 @entity9 : @entity125 , @entity109 , @entity94 ( c ) , @entity13 , @entity126 , @entity98 ( @entity26 84 ) , @entity116 , @entity113 ( best 65 ) , @entity127 , march ( @entity112 18 ) , @entity69 substitutes not used : @entity128 ( gk ) , @entity129 , @entity68 , @entity131 - @entity130 scorers : dunk 42 ; @entity26 89 booked : @entity116 @entity3 : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity133 ( c ) , @entity6 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity61 , @entity8 , @entity21 ( @entity136 88 ) , @entity137 , @entity138 ( @entity139 79 ) substitutes not used : @entity140 ( gk ) , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 scorers : @entity6 43 ; @entity21 63 ; @entity8 86 referee : @entity147 ( @entity148 ) attendance : 26,267 ( 1,727 away ) the game was screaming out for a goal			1
in the event , it got two within the space of 120 seconds and both as a result of dubious goalkeeping			0
the hosts gained a deserved lead three minutes before the break			0
another set - piece wide on the left from @entity98 caused panic in @entity3 ranks and , after @entity59 came for it and missed completely , @entity13 diverted the ball home though it may have brushed @entity61 on its way in			2
the joy was short - lived			0
barely seconds from the restart , @entity3 won a set - piece of their own about 10 yards in from the touchline on the left			0
@entity8 swung it in and @entity6 met the ball with a header that crept in off the inside of the post			2
@entity178 had come out , hesitated and was left stranded as @entity6 made no mistake			0
@entity9 continued to set the pace at the beginning of the second - half and @entity59 spread himself to block @entity69 ’s effort following @entity185 ’s flick from @entity126 ’s cross			2
@entity116 ( left ) of @entity9 battles for the ball with @entity3 's @entity62 it was just after the hour mark when @entity116 , struggling to keep pace with the burly run of @entity135 , brought him down a matter of millimetres outside the box			2
this was a situation that spelt trouble and so it proved as @entity7 lashed the ball low through a crowded box and into the bottom corner			0
suddenly the game sprung into life			0
at one end , @entity62 headed over the bar			0
at the other , the dancing feet of @entity69 worked space for a shot that took a hefty deflection and crashed back off the post			0
@entity3 wrapped up victory five minutes from time when @entity8 rolled in from close range after @entity137 weaved his way between two defenders to tee him up			1
but there was still a nail - biting finish for the travelling fans after @entity26 headed in a @entity112 corner in the final minute but @entity3 clung on to ensure @entity1 ’s perfect start			1
@entity13 bundles the ball home to hand @entity9 the lead against @entity3			1

@entity13 opened the scoring for @entity9 at the @entity39
@entity3 defender @entity6 replied for the away side
@entity229 man @entity7 gave @entity3 the lead in the second half
@entity8 secured all three points for @entity1 with a third
@entity26 netted a *consolation* goal for @entity9 in injury time
