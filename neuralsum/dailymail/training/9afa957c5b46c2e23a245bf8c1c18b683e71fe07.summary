scientists have mimicked evolution in the laboratory for the first time using droplets of oil			1
the researchers behind the study claim their work proves that a non-biological system composed of chemicals can be made to evolve			1
the findings mark an important step towards creating synthetic life and may also help scientists to explain how the first biological cells appeared on @entity15 more than 3.6 billion years ago			1
scientists used a robot to find the ' fittest ' droplets in experiments by selecting desirable properties like division ( b ) , vibration ( e ) and movement ( f ) that over time led to the droplets becoming more stable evolution was long believed to be a process that only biological creatures were capable of , but recent research aimed towards creating synthetic life has begun to question that idea			1
professor @entity31 , regius chair of chemistry at the @entity33 who led the new research , used a robot to create tiny oil droplets from a mixture of four chemicals			1
each droplet was dropped into a petri dish of water and analysed for three different types of ' fitness ' over the course of a minute using video cameras			0
building an entire lifeform from scratch is a daunting task , although many scientists believe it may be possible within the next ten years			0
they believe that synthetic living systems could be made to order to solve a range of problems , from producing new drugs to creating biofuels			1
professor @entity56 is among those who have been leading the way and has already placed a basic dna set synthesised in the laboratory into a bacterial cell			0
however , while these cells could replicate they were not able to survive without crucial nutrients provided by the scientists			2
this , they insist , is an important safety measure to stop synthetic cells from escaping and replicating in the environment			0
yet synthetic life will not necessarily have to be based on the same biochemical molecules as our own			1
researchers at the @entity74 in @entity75 used an entirely synthetic form of dna , called @entity78 , to store genetic information and catalyse simple biochemical reactions			0
these could eventually be used to evolve entirely new forms of life , the scientists believe			2
if combined with the oil droplets created by the researchers at the @entity33 , it may be possible to create cells that can house the @entity78 systems and take scientists a step closer to creating entirely artificial forms of life			1
the robot then selected the droplet that performed best and the chemical composition of this was used to replicate the experiment , tweaking the mixture slightly each time			1
over the course of 21 generations , the oil droplets became more stable in the watery world in which they were being dropped			1
this , according to professor @entity104 , mimicked the process of natural selection , which @entity108 proposed for driving evolution			0
but rather than pressure from the environment and other species driving the evolution of the droplets , it was the robot			0
professor @entity104 said : ' this is the first time that an evolvable chemical system has existed outside of biology			2
' in recent years , we ’ve learned a great deal about the process of biological evolution through computer simulations			0
' however , this research provides the possibility of new ways of looking at the origins of life as well as creating new simple chemical life forms			2
' the robotic system initially created oil droplets at random using four chemicals , choosing from octanol , diethyl phthalate , pentanol and either octanoic acid or dodecane			1
the researchers selected these chemicals with the aim of producing droplets that had a wide range of motility - the ability to move spontaneously and actively - stability , the ability to divide , viscosity and density			1
in total they examined 225 unique combinations of these chemical by placing four drops of each mixture into a dish			0
the robot was programmed to look for those that moved around the dish the most , the amount they vibrated in the water and their ability to divide over the course of one minute			0
the best performing droplet was then selected and its chemical formula used as the basis of a second generation of droplets and again the ' fittest ' droplet was selected to form the basis of the next generation			1
the scientists adapted a 3d printer to create a robot that was able to mix and tweak the oil compounds before using a camera to select those that performed best in a series of tests in a @entity157 ( @entity181 arena ) full of water they found that droplets without octanoic acid were best at dividing and moving around the dish but some octanoic acid is required for the best vibration response			1
in total 21 generations of droplets were created and they became more stable , dividing into many , fast moving but distinct droplets			1
the researchers believe their set up can be used to create chemical systems that will evolve freely without the need for the robot			1
in their paper in @entity198 , they said : ' while most of the characteristics of ‘ life ’ are wholly dependent on the robot in the current system , we propose that these dependencies could be removed stepwise , in serial evolutionary experiments , to move the chemical system towards full autonomy , avoiding the all - or - nothing barrier that currently plagues the study of minimal chemical replicators			2
' it is therefore our intention to focus follow - up work towards the creation of artificial life - like assemblies , driven by a thesis that is chemically agnostic , thereby opening up investigations of new evolvable chemical systems			1
' the findings could also help to explain how complex mixtures of chemicals on the early @entity15 came together to form the oily membranes found in every living biological cell			2
scientists believe these first formed capsules inside which the first biochemical processes began to evolve			2
four droplets of each mixture were deposited by the robot ( top left ) into a @entity157 ( bottom left ) and then monitored for stability in the water and to see whether they divided ( bottom right ) , moved or vibrated ' we are interested in exploring how life started on planet earth , which was almost certainly due to a large number of high probable events , ' said professor @entity104			2
' but it probably took a long time - between 100 million and a billion years			0
so to speed up the ‘ search ’ we have used a cheap - @entity244 printer platform and turned it into a chemical robot that can automatically do precise experiments			0
' by hacking together this kit we have in effect built a highly sophisticated machine that can fully automate a life cycle in the life of a chemical proto - cell model and used the robot to explore lots of different types of ingredients to try and come up with ‘ interesting ’ recipes that show ‘ life - like ’ behaviours , which include cell - division , movement , vibration , wobbling , clustering and so on			0
' we can show that statistically , the chances of droplet evolution happening at the origin of life is higher than a complete biological cell just ‘ springing into existence ’			0
' this means that the probability of life just spontaneously forming just went up dramatically			0
it is not an impossible miracle anymore			0
' professor @entity104 added that the technique could also be adapted to help scientists develop new types of chemical compounds for use in industry and medicine			0
he said : ' biological evolution has given rise to enormously complex and sophisticated forms of life , and our robot - driven form of evolution could have the potential to do something similar for chemical systems			1
' this initial phase of research has shown that the system we ’ve designed is capable of facilitating an evolutionary process , so we could in the future create models to perform specific tasks , such as splitting , then seeking out other droplets and fusing with them			2
' we ’re also keen to explore in future experiments how the emergence of unexpected features , functions and behaviours might be selected for			0

@entity33 researchers say it is the first time a non-biological system has been shown to evolve over successive generations
robot used four chemicals to create 225 droplets and selected the ' fittest '
over 21 generations the oil droplets ' evolved ' to become more stable
scientists hope to create chemical systems that can replicate and evolve themselves which will be a first step towards creating synthetic life
findings may explain how living cells first formed billions of years ago
