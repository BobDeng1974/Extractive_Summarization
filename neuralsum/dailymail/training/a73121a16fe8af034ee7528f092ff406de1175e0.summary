it may not be a fruit that you automatically reach for in the supermarket , but the large and exotic breadfruit is being touted as a wonder food			1
known by its @entity8 name , artocarpus altilis , the fruit has lumpy green flesh and a potato - like texture so that it can be served as part of a main meal or turned into sweets			1
it was once a staple in the @entity17 diet and now experts believe it could provide food security on the island , which imports more than half of its food			1
just one breadfruit , which weighs around 7lbs ( three kgs ) , provides the carbohydrate portion of a meal for a family of five			1
the fruit can be ground into flour and used in sweet and savoury dishes , including pancakes and crisps			1
it is rich in vitamins and minerals , as well as being a high source of gluten - free carbohydrate and protein			1
the protein in the fruit has a higher proportion of aminio acids than soy			1
@entity57 of @entity59 ’s @entity58 ( @entity58 ) has been studying the plant since the 1980s , which some people say is bland and starchy			0
@entity64 , founder of the charity trees that feed , said that the high - protein fruit can be used to make pancakes			1
a third of a cup of breadfruit flour is added to the same quantity of orange juice as well as one egg , cinnamon , nutmeg and vanilla			2
the mixture is fried in a pan and this recipe makes pancakes for three people			0
@entity25 crisps and pasta are being developed so that the food can be more easily stored			1
the @entity58 said that mature breadfruit is a healthy substitute for any starchy food such as rice and potatoes if it is boiled , steamed or baked			2
small immature fruit can be boiled , pickled and marinated			0
they are said to taste like artichoke hearts			0
ripe fruits are creamy and sweet and can be eaten raw or used to make cakes and pies			2
even the flowers found on the trees can be candied and eaten as sweets			2
she has studied hundreds of varieties from 34 countries			0
together with @entity102 of @entity103 in @entity104 , she traced back the roots of the fruit using dna analysis to the breadfruit ‘ eve ’			2
most of the fruit she examined included fingerprints of a plant called the breadnut that grows in @entity115			0
the breadnut is thought to be the ancestor of the breadfruit			0
in 2003 dr @entity57 created the @entity58 ’s @entity58 , which includes an orchard on the island of @entity121			0
scientists there are working with the charity alliance to end hunger with the aim of distributing breadfruit to places without a regular supply of food across the world			1
‘ traditionally in @entity133 you would plant a breadfruit when a child was born , because that would guarantee food throughout the child ’s life ’ dr @entity102 said			2
breadfruit trees require little care and thrive in the tropics			2
now experts are investigating which varieties best suit certain environments and climates – as well as local tastes – in countries lacking food security			1
@entity25 ( pictured ) was once a staple in the diet of @entity17 and experts think it could provide food security on the island , which imports more than half of its food			1
it is viatamin and mineral rich , as well as being a high source of gluten - free carbohydrate and protein just one breadfruit , which weighs around seven lbs ( three kilograms ) provides the carbohydrate portion of a meal for a family of five			1
the fruit can be ground into flour and used in sweet and savoury dishes , including pancakes and crisps @entity25 was first bought to the @entity169 in the 18th century to feed slaves			1
lieutenant @entity171 first bought the fruit to @entity17 from @entity173			0
it is said that on the way , his crew mutinied and set him adrift , dumping the cargo of breadfruit plants overboard with him			0
on his second attempt as a captain in 1792 , he brought 2,000 of the plants to @entity17 and 678 bore fruit			0
intended as a stable and cheap food for slaves , breadfruit was not much liked and it took around 50 years for it to be incorporated willingly into local dishes			2
scientists think that the fruit 's ancestor is the breadnut , which is native to @entity115			2
@entity25 is so called because of its high carbohydrate and fibre content			1
when it is just ripe enough to eat , it is more like bread as it is starchy and dry , but when it is softer and riper it tastes sweeter and is more moist			0
they are also identifying which varieties of the fruit produce the best yields and protein content			0
they think that some of the fruit are highly tolerant to salt , which could prove important in the @entity169 as sea levels rise			0
however , some varieties of breadfruit relied upon by people in the eastern @entity212 are proving to be less robust			0
scientists are trying to use tissue culture methods to create breadfruit trees that yield more fruit sooner			1
while progress is difficult , the experts have grown disease - free trees that start bearing fruit at two years of age – three years sooner than is usual			1
from the varieties propagated , 35,000 trees have now been sent to 26 countries , including @entity17 and @entity225			0
a variety called @entity227 , which is native to @entity228 , bears fruit a different time to varieties found in the @entity169 , extending the time when the nutritious fruit is available			0
it is hoped that one day there could be forests of breadfruit trees throughout the @entity169			0
the starchy fruit can be ground into flour and used in sweet and savoury dishes , including pancakes and crisps ( pictured )			1
