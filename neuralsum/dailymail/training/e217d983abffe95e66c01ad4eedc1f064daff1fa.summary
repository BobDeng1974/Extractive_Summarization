lost : @entity2 ' founder @entity1 has lost his @entity4 bid to block extradition to @entity6 where he faces sex crime allegations			1
he is pictured arriving at the @entity4 this morning the founder of @entity2 @entity1 , centre , arrives for his extradition hearing at the @entity4 in @entity21 today , the @entity4 upheld a ruling by district judge @entity23 at @entity24 , south @entity21 , in february that the computer expert should be extradited to face investigation			2
@entity1 , whose @entity2 website published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses , denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated			2
@entity1 's supporters , including journalist @entity35 , gathered outside the @entity4 in @entity21 today awaiting his arrival			1
but , there was no sign of the celebrity circus that supported him earlier this year , including socialite @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and film - maker @entity44			1
ms @entity41 publicly contributed £ 20,000 towards @entity1 's £ 200,000 bail when he was arrested in december last year			1
celebrity support : @entity41 contributed to mr @entity1 's £ 200,000 bail and was photographed supporting him in february celebrity supporters who turned up to support @entity1 in february including left , @entity41 and @entity42 and right , @entity43 , a social and human rights advocate , but they did not show up today a supporter of the @entity2 founder holds a placard outside @entity53			1
supporters were not hopeful for good news but pledged to continue to back the @entity10 dressed in a sharp , navy blue suit and wearing a @entity60 poppy , the world 's most famous whistleblower was mobbed as he approached the court building and police had to redirect him away from the crowd			0
@entity1 nodded and smiled at his supporters , who broke into a round of applause as he passed			2
fixed to the iron railings of the court were banners reading ' @entity70 ! free @entity71 ! end the wars '			0
memoir : an unauthorised autobiography published against mr @entity1 's wishes sold less than 700 copies in its first three days on release last month however , moments later the judges ruled that the issuing of the @entity81 arrest warrant ( @entity82 ) that led to @entity1 's arrest and all subsequent proceedings to achieve extradition were ' proportionate '			1
they dismissed @entity1 's argument that the warrant was invalid because it had been issued by a prosecutor , and not a ' judicial authority '			1
the judges held the action of the prosecutor was subject to the independent scrutiny of @entity6 judges , ' which , as judges of another ( @entity97 ) member state , we must respect '			1
the court also rejected @entity1 's assertion that the descriptions of the offences were not a fair and accurate description of the conduct alleged against him			2
@entity71 is the detained @entity105 soldier alleged to have leaked hundreds of thousands of @entity105 diplomatic cables to @entity2			0
the judges said that any application by @entity1 to appeal to the @entity109 would be decided at a further hearing at a date to be fixed			1
@entity1 showed no emotion and made notes while president of the @entity115 , sir @entity116 , read out a summary of the court 's reasons for its ruling			0
the @entity1 legal challenge , which has attracted worldwide attention , centred on a @entity81 arrest warrant ( @entity82 ) issued by a @entity6 prosecutor which led to @entity1 's arrest in december last year			1
his qc , @entity127 , argued at a two - day hearing in july that the prosecutor was not a ' judicial authority ' entitled to issue the @entity82			0
the warrant had also contained ' fundamental misstatements ' of what occurred in @entity15 last august while @entity1 was in @entity6 to give a lecture , said the @entity134			1
one of @entity1 's supporters who did turn up was journalist @entity35 who is pictured talking to reporters outside the @entity4 @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 where @entity1 has been staying as part of his bail conditions			2
he has denied any wrongdoing @entity1 's encounters with the two women involved consensual sex and would not be considered crimes in @entity147 , he said			0
the @entity82 was misleading in its accusations that he had used violence or ' acted in a manner to violate sexual integrity ' , said mr @entity127			0
@entity1 burst into the public consciousness in april 2010 when @entity2 released collateral murder - video footage of a @entity105 air crew shooting @entity156 civilians in 2007			2
the whistleblower website , which claimed a database of 1.2 million documents within a year of its 2006 launch , regularly hit the headlines in 2010 with a series of leaks			0
the @entity105 @entity166 cables , @entity168 war logs and iraq war logs , which were drip - fed to the media in 2010 , helped raise the profile of @entity1			2
he recently revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds			0
the stricken website is running on cash reserves after an ' arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade ' was imposed by @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 last december , said @entity1			2
these ' mis - descriptions ' were at odds with descriptions given by the women themselves about what had occurred			0
supporters outside the court said they were ' outraged ' by the judges ' decision			2
@entity196 , 44 , held a sign asking : ' why are we persecuting the innocent ? ' the @entity10 @entity200 worker , who had come from south @entity21 with her husband to show her support , said : ' i think he 's a hero for truth and exposing corruption			0
' i think they 're out to get him - the system in general and , i think , the @entity105 and @entity10 governments			0
' he 's made a lot of enemies in high places			0
' @entity213 , 51 , said : ' we 've got to stop the war and free @entity1 and @entity71			0
' @entity1 is probably the most amazing person in recent history who 's upset so many powerful people in such a short space of time so it 's obviously not a level playing field			0
' his fans declared they would continue to give @entity1 their full support			0
still conspicuous : mr @entity1 was wearing a mask at the @entity226 demonstration earlier this month in july , the @entity4 heard how @entity1 told a woman he stands accused of raping that he wanted to impregnate her and other ‘ virgins ’ in august last year after he visited @entity6 to give a lecture			1
he is said to have told his alleged victim in @entity15 : ‘ @entity6 is a good country to have kids in			2
’ the court also heard that @entity1 had a ‘ strange ’ discussion with the museum worker and she later awoke to find him having unprotected sex with her			1
he is accused of saying he ‘ wanted to impregnate women ’ and that he ‘ preferred virgins because he would be the first to impregnate them ’			0
the former computer hacker is also accused of ‘ violently ’ forcing himself on another woman in @entity15			0
@entity1 denies the allegations and has always claimed that they were politically motivated and linked to the activities of the whistleblower website			0
a warrant was issued for his arrest in august last year , but was rescinded after a prosecutor ruled there was no evidence of rape			1
he remained in @entity6 for thirty eight days but another @entity251 was issued on november 18 2010 .			1

his *lawyers* had asked judges to rule his extradition would be ' unfair and unlawful '
no sign of his celebrity supporters including @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43
@entity1 could now appeal the decision at the @entity109
this *article* was amended on 8 march . an earlier version stated that a ‘ warrant was issued for his arrest in august last year . mr @entity1 left @entity6 eight days later after a prosecutor ruled there was no evidence of rape . but another @entity251 was issued on *september* 1 . ’ in fact , the warrant for mr @entity1 ’s arrest was rescinded after the prosecutor ruled there was no evidence of rape . mr @entity1 then remained in @entity6 for thirty eight days but another @entity251 was issued on november 18 2010 .
