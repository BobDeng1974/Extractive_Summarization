by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 26 april 2013 golf fans are used to seeing a @entity2 on the course in big @entity5 tournaments			1
but it â€™s quite another thing for an alligator to be spotted on the fairway			0
a three - legged giant reptile briefly stole the limelight when it hobbled on to the green at the @entity13 event in @entity14			1
just for good measure , the uninvited guest also checked out the bunker and the rough as golfers played on around it			2
the battle - scarred creature even decided to take a rest on the green as the golfers played on around it			1
@entity42 has the largest population of alligators in the @entity5 , with hundreds of thousands of the reptiles living in swamps across the state			1
the creatures are also found in @entity54 and in the southern parts of @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , eastern @entity61 , the southeast corner of @entity63 and the southern tip of @entity65			0
luckily for the golfers , humans are not high up the alligator 's list of favourite foods - with large fish such as gar , turtles , various mammals , particularly nutria and muskrat , as well as birds , deer and other reptiles their most commons prey			2
attacks on human are few , but not unknown , and usually occur if an alligator feels threatened			0
break : another alligator seemed unconcerned by the attention it received as it took a rest on the green capturing the moment : it takes a break on fairway as a caddie takes a picture on his phone tidy up : a course worker smooths away tracks after an alligator crossed through a sand trap			0
