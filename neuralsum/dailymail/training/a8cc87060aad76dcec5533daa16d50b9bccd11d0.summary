a second elephant was also caught stepping over a electric fence near the @entity2 in @entity3 by @entity4 published : 10:38 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 12:38 est , 5 march 2014 incredible snaps have been taken of the moment when @entity9 the elephant skillfully manages to step over a barbed wire fence put up by a farmer in @entity3			1
the four ton beast has chosen to roam across @entity3 by daintily skipping over fences instead of trampling everything in its wake			1
it elegantly lifts its front right leg over the wire , taking care not to touch it , then its left leg before repeating the process with its hind legs			1
after one final push it is free and ready to hunt for food			2
the photos show that @entity9 clearly has respect for her surroundings and does n't want to be blamed for any damage			2
elephants are known for their intelligence and ability to solve problems - @entity9 's antics confirm how true that is			2
' they will come as no surprise to scientists who have studied elephants brains , particularly when confronted with danger			2
their ability to remember means elephants can dodge not just fences but droughts too			0
the theory is that older females memorise earlier severe droughts and how the elephants at the time survived it			0
this means they know where to find distant food and water sources giving them a better chance of survival as climate change becomes a real threat to their natural habitats			0
acrobatic : the elephant makes the whole process look easy despite his size and having four legs nearly there : @entity9 proves she 's no @entity88 and is now close to escaping strolls away : the elephant successfully negotiates the fence and free is to roam but @entity9 is n't the only elephant dodging obstacles across @entity3			1
a second elephant was also caught on film skillfully having to avoid a electric fence in @entity96 , near the @entity2			1
this time the cheeky little elephant steps over the fence to grab a branch from a much - loved marula fruit tree in the back garden of a house			1
the elephant is clearly keen to avoid past experiences such as being tangled up or electrocuted by a nasty fence			1
after having his snack the young male then lifts both legs back over the fence carefully - despite no current being passed through the electric fence			1
@entity111 , the journalist who filmed the baby elephant , said : ' it was quite strange to see the elephant do this but it is marula fruit season and elephants love them			1
he remembered the fence for sure , he is a regular visitor to the area			2
it was interesting to see an animal think and plan its way around the obstacles , the owner of the property has reported him going as far as their front door , up hills and over more fences			0
quite a busy little boy he is			0
' sadly not all elephants find it so easy to adapt to their manmade surroundings and can experience horrific accidents while roaming			0
in may last year four elephants were killed after they became trapped on a railway line and were hit by a speeding train			0
the elephants were part of a herd crossing the railroad tracks in eastern @entity142 when the express passenger train ploughed into them			0
two adult female elephants and one calf were killed at the scene while another died later from its injuries			0
dozens of elephants have died in recent years in such accidents as trains run through national parks and forests			0
activists have called for trains to lower their speeds through such areas			0
strong memory : this young elephant skillfully avoids the electric fence - he 's clearly had a shocking experience before best foot forward : he 's determined to reach his favourite marula fruit tree and nothing will stand in his way one step at a time : the elephant breaches the fence and enjoys his lunch reaching out for a branch in the back garden of a house			1
