by tuesday , officers had returned to the area around @entity148 , where earlier @entity149 had said they had @entity1 contained in a five - square mile area			2
cops say @entity1 then made his getaway in a green 2001 jeep but crashed it into a swamp two miles north of the barracks			2
they say he then made his way on foot 25 miles through dense forest back to the area close to the home he shared with his parents and teenage sister			0
over the past week they have found an @entity164 that was missing from his home along with soiled diapers and a rare brand of @entity170 cigarette			0

still looking : @entity0 lt. col. @entity9 , pictured last week , says he believes the bombs were hastily discarded , suggesting that @entity1 is feeling pressure from the search ' we have found a number of locations i believe he has stayed in , there has not been a bunker per se , but partially constructed shelters such as deer blinds , ' he said			1
the search for @entity1 is about to get more complicated as bow hunting for deer in the woods is set to start on saturday			1
@entity232 spokesman @entity231 said that assuming @entity1 is not captured overnight , hunting would be closed in the area of the search , which is teeming with hundreds of heavily armed law enforcement officers			2
@entity231 said the exact perimeter of the closure has not been finalized			0
hunters have already been asked to keep an eye out for cabins or other structures that look like they 've been tampered with or used by @entity1			2

' but i do n't believe we have the authority to prohibit people			0
there is a balance that has to be struck			0
