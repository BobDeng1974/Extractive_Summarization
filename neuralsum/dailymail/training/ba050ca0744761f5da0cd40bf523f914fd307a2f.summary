by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 16:10 est , 23 january 2014 most people see maps as dry , practical objects which are only useful for motorists and ramblers			0
but one artist has discovered the hidden beauty of the atlas , turning everyday maps into eye - catching portraits			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 , uses the contours of maps as the basis for pictures of people he knows , and is now taking his works on tour to the @entity23 transformation : this portrait of a face drawn over a map of @entity28 is on of the creative works of artist @entity13 creative : a woman 's face drawn using the contours of a map of @entity34 , in @entity35 evocative : a map of @entity37 , in @entity38 , with a woman 's features drawn on his first map - based work , in september 2012 , sparked a wave of new ideas , with the artist going on to adapt maps of places such as @entity49 , @entity37 , @entity50 and @entity28			1
the 24 - year - old has now lost count of how many map portraits he has created , with each work taking between a couple of days and a month to complete			1
mr @entity13 has started making more works inspired by @entity23 , and already has paintings hanging in a gallery in @entity59 , @entity60			2
' towards the end of uni , i created a body of work based upon the structures and patterns found throughout the human figure - and , in 2012 , i began transcribing those textures onto pre-patterned surfaces , such as maps , ' he said			0
celestial : mr @entity13 is not restricted to the @entity74 - this picture is based on the zodiac @entity76 : the artist is turning his attentions to the @entity23 , such as this map of @entity60 drawing board : a nude portrait in the process of being drawn by mr @entity13 , who lives in @entity14 astonishing : the model 's flowing hair winds across the landscape of the map used to create this portrait ' they are unpredictable by nature			2
it sounds a bit dramatic , i know , but compared to handling white paper , it 's a real treat to work with an ever - changing surface			0
' i 'm inspired by many things , most of which are difficult to put into words - particular moods , colours , ideas			0
' most of the works i produce are portraits of my creative partner , @entity104 - she has a strong interest in paper sculpture and will often cut into our collaborative projects			0
eerie : a naked woman spread over the map of @entity112 drawn in vivid blue black and white : a woman casts a sideways look across the city of @entity117 creative process : mr @entity13 has been making his map - based portraits for more than a year ' if i 'm working on a commission the location is almost always important , and usually of significance to the client			1
' with the self - directed work , i produce the location is less important and i 'm more concerned with the aesthetics of the map , but sometimes by coincidence i 'll work into somewhere familiar			0
' the portraits start at £ 1,000 , with the most expensive so far selling for £ 12,000 .			1

@entity13 , 24 , adapts maps of the world into portraits of his friends
he sells the artworks for at least £ 1,000 each to eager *collectors*
