@entity0 still has the full support of his coach , team - mates and selectors and is unbeaten in four @entity5			1
but his hopes of remaining @entity8 captain in the @entity9 this summer hinge on what is going on back home			2
the opinions of @entity14 chairman - elect @entity13 , new chief executive @entity15 and the man they eventually make director of cricket matter far more than what anyone in the @entity21 thinks			0
the three half - centuries @entity0 made in his last four test innings of last summer count for little now as his battle to prove he remains the best man for the job nears crunch time			1
@entity8 captain @entity0 is not concerned about his failure to hit a test hundred since may 2013 @entity0 remains @entity8 's leading century maker despite his recent failure to score a test century @entity0 ( right , pictured with @entity34 ) and his team - mates are preparing for @entity8 's second test the second test that starts here is not exactly make or break for @entity0 but he needs runs and a victory as much as at any time in a career that has seen him score more test centuries than any other @entity44			1
the decision of @entity13 and @entity15 to sack @entity46 as managing director and announce that they are looking for a new ‘ supremo ’ to replace him has placed @entity0 and @entity50 under more pressure than ever			2
by definition , the new powers at the @entity14 can not have been happy about the big decisions @entity46 made in a traumatic 14 months and few were bigger than the move to bring back @entity50 as coach and the continued backing of @entity0			2
@entity8 could not have done much more to force victory in @entity60 on a pitch deader than @entity63 ’s parrot but their failure to beat @entity65 has made the remaining two @entity5 vital			2
@entity0 was both proactive and imaginative for much of that first test but he is a captain who leads mainly by example and simply has to break a run that now sees him without a test century for 33 innings			1
the statistics certainly make grim reading for @entity0			0
in 21 of those 33 innings he has not passed 25 and his @entity5 average of 45.65 is lower than at any time since the 2010 - 11 @entity9			1
since the last of his 25 test centuries , against @entity74 at @entity75 in may 2013 , he is averaging under 29			0
if @entity8 really do want a change at the top then it must come sooner rather than later , particularly if , as expected , they would bypass vice-captain @entity79 and go straight to the man who now seems the heir apparent , @entity80			0
the only way for @entity0 to stop the questions about his lack of a big innings is to replicate the form he has been showing in practice here with his new slightly open stance and go back to churning out the runs			1
‘ i have been working with @entity92 on a number of things , as you always do , ’ said @entity0 of his decision to work with @entity92 , his old mentor and the man he sacked as @entity8 batting coach			1
‘ you ’re always trying to tinker with your technique and might fall into certain habits at various times in your career			0
@entity80 lays on the ground to check out the pitch while @entity0 ( right ) and @entity106 ( centre ) look on @entity0 ( left ) , @entity108 ( centre ) and @entity110 ( right ) go for a gentle jog at the @entity112 ‘ but the most important thing is not to concentrate too much on technique when you are out in the middle			1
you have to concentrate on what is important — the ball coming down to you , the situation you ’re in and the conditions			0
‘ i ’m a resilient guy who tries to play each ball on its merits for as long as possible , that ’s what my success has been built on , and i remain desperate to set the tone at the top of the order with some runs			0
’ it was hoped that the pitch at a @entity132 here that was rebuilt after the devastating hurricane of 2004 would have a bit more pace than @entity60 but @entity0 expressed his ‘ surprise ’ at how wet and soft it was , at least on sunday			0
that means @entity8 will consider bringing in leg - spinner @entity110 for @entity140 , while @entity108 looks certain to return in place of @entity142 , who has been ‘ struggling ’ with a shoulder problem suffered in @entity60			2
the ‘ big two ’ of record - breaking @entity151 and @entity152 will both play despite a demanding first test while @entity145 , rightly , carries on as opener with @entity0 despite his two failures on his return to the side in @entity60			1
there is much promise in this @entity8 team , particularly in a middle order that will see one of @entity108 , @entity106 or @entity158 batting as low as eight , but questions remain about the man at the top			0
it is up to @entity0 to answer them			0
@entity0 warms up during the @entity8 nets session at the @entity112 in @entity166 @entity8 players prepare for the second test in the nets in @entity170			1

@entity0 has gone 33 test innings without hitting a century
the *30* - year - old remains @entity8 's leading century maker despite blip
@entity0 has been watching old *footage* of himself to study his technique
