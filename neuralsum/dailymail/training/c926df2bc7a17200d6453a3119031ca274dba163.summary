by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:29 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 16:12 est , 18 october 2012 the dangers of @entity4 sky lanterns are to be examined by a government study which could pave the way for them to be banned , @entity1 has learned			2
ministers are poised to launch an independent study to assess the scale of the risks posed to livestock , crops and the environment			2
the probe will look at international efforts to limit their impact and consider their value to the economy after a boom in popularity of releasing the lanterns at weddings , festivals and parties			1
a government study into the safety of sky lanterns will examine their use around the world			0
dozens are pictured being released in @entity33 the image of sky lanterns filing the sky has made them popular for weddings , parties and festivals but ahead of @entity41 , ministers are urging people to think twice about using them farming leaders have long called for a ban on the lanterns , complaining that when the wire frames fall back to earth they can be eaten by cattle			1
several cows have died as a result of choking on small pieces of wire chopped up into hay or silage when crops are harvested , according to the @entity56			1
new farming minister @entity57 , who warned of the dangers of the lanterns in opposition , is to order a study into the dangers and urged people to ‘ think carefully ’ before using them			1
he said : ‘ the government is aware of concerns about the impacts of sky lanterns on animals , crops and property and has taken steps to raise public awareness about the potential dangers sky lanterns pose , and to encourage people to think carefully before using them			0
new farming minister @entity57 said an independent study would look at the risks posed to the environment , livestock and plants ‘ we will continue to look for further opportunities to do this over the coming months , especially as we approach bonfire night			1
‘ in order to assess the extent of the dangers posed by sky lanterns and possible steps to address such dangers , @entity84 proposes to commission an independent study to examine in detail the scale of the risks associated with the use of sky lanterns , and their impact on livestock , plants and the environment			1
‘ the results of this study will help inform any future @entity64 action			0
’ before the general election mr @entity57 suggested he did not want to ban the lanterns , but there are concerns that even a move to alternatives using wicker instead of wire have failed to remove all the risks			1
in addition to the threat posed to livestock , there are also dangers that a lit flame could ignite crops or hedgerows during dry weather			0
@entity121 , rural surveyor for the @entity56 , said today : ‘ these types of lanterns may be fun and look pretty when they ’re lit but they can pose a real danger to farms and farm animals , especially livestock in fields			2
‘ cattle can eat the wire in the lantern which finds its way into the silage they are fed. the lanterns land in fields , are chopped up into small pieces when grass is gathered and made into silage			2
if swallowed , the wire can puncture the stomach lining , causing extreme pain and in some cases can be fatal			0
the @entity56 says some cows have died after choking on the wire frames of lanterns which have been chopped up into feed ‘ there ’s also a good chance that the wire part of the frame could get wrapped around an animal 's foot , become embedded in the skin and would cause extreme pain			1
‘ obviously , fire is also another major problem particularly during the summer			0
these lanterns can pose a serious risk if they land in a field of crops or straw			0
perhaps worse is if they come down near a barn or even by a thatched house which could easily catch fire			0
’ @entity165 environment secretary @entity164 , who tabled parliamentary questions about the problem , said : ' many people enjoy letting off @entity4 lanterns to celebrate special occasions , but there are complaints from farmers about the harm they can cause to farm animals and machinery			2
' we welcome this research into those issues so that the government has the full facts at its finfertips before changing the law			0
' the @entity56 has urged its members to contact any venues near their farms using lanterns to warn them of the dangers and pleasing with them not to use them			0
a @entity84 spokesman said : ‘ given the concerns and complaints that are being made about the damage sky lanterns can do , we want to find out just what effect they are having on farming and the environment			1

new farming minister @entity57 commissions an inquiry into the impact of the lanterns on the environment , livestock and plants
@entity206 welcomes the investigation , warning cows have died after choking on wire frames
lanterns have *soared* in popularity at weddings , parties and festivals
