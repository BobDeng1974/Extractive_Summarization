it all started with @entity1 creams - a multi-functional product that harnesses smart new technology so you can replace your serum , moisturiser , primer , foundation and sun block with just one product			2
the creams became one of the hottest trends in the beauty industry and are one of its fasting growing product areas with sales hitting £ 23m last year			0
clearly catching onto the alphabetization theme , then came @entity23 and even @entity25 cream , but do n't bother getting to grips with them because @entity29 creams are already hitting shelves			1
the £ 34 cream , which lands in stores on october 1 , has been designed to give wearers naturally glowing , even - toned skin			1
the product aims to help break the cycle of daily assaults and irritation that lead to hyperpigmentation and dark spots			0
understanding that discolouration is a top , universal concern for women , @entity42 scientists have been researching the day / night rhythm of pigmentation			1
they discovered that our skin becomes aggravated by uv rays and pollution in the day and dark spots , discolouration and other types of hyperpigmentation are exacerbated whilst we sleep			0
how does it work ? the product is packed with an ingredient called @entity77 , which aims to minimise the visible effects of irritation from pollution that can trigger the formation of excess pigment and dark spots they therefore developed a cream packed with an ingredient called @entity77 , which aims to minimise the visible effects of irritation from pollution that can trigger the formation of excess pigment and dark spots			0
to give skin an overall more even effect , this smooth , fluid creme includes color - correcting pigments that promise to give skin a naturally luminous finish			1
speaking about the new product , celebrity make - up artist @entity97 said : ' as a great foundation alternative this new cream is a buildable illuminating skin perfecting base			1
' it 's packed with powerful ingredients to protect and nourish your skin with long lasting results			0
as a makeup artist i was never convinced by all the @entity1 , @entity23 and now @entity29 creams but i 'm now converted and that 's down to @entity42 and @entity111 who do it best			2
' the cream gives a flawless result without looking heavy or cakey and women these days looking for more protection or skincare benefits in their makeup need look no further			0
' using colour correcting pigments and a blend of fine optics you can easily achieve a flawless complexion whilst protecting and nourishing your skin , the perfect no makeup , makeup			0
' beauty blogger @entity127 is n't as convinced : ' i think a lot of beauty brands have fallen prey to the hype surrounding the original bb cream launches here in the @entity132 – and have become slightly obsessed with being the first to release a new wonder cream that somehow conquers a new letter of the alphabet			2
‘ @entity42 is a brilliant brand and i have no doubt that this product will be really luxurious and effective , but personally i think tying it to the alphabet trend cheapens it and makes it seem more like a gimmick than a great new release			2
’ are brands going to keep making their way through the alphabet all the way to z or will we be zzzz of it all by then ? l - r : @entity152 , £ 6.99 , @entity153 , £ 6.66 , @entity154 , £ 30.00 l - r : @entity111 - @entity154 , £ 29 , @entity155 , £ 27 , @entity156 , £ 6.99 l - r : @entity157 , £ 9.99 , @entity158 with @entity159 15			1

@entity42 unveiled @entity44 even effect @entity48 30
£ 34 cream designed to give wearers naturally glowing , even - toned skin
are brands just *cashing* in on alphabetization ?
