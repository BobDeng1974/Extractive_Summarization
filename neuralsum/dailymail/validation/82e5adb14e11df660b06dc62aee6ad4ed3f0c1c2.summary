but many fans headed straight for the tunnel under the seated upper stand and leading directly to the already - packed central pens of the terrace behind the goal			1
the tunnel was not closed off by police beforehand and the numbers of fans in each pen was not restricted - with police and club officials having a policy of allowing supporters to ‘ find their own level ’ by distributing themselves along the terraces			2
in the run - up to kick - off mr @entity9 was in charge of a serial of officers inside the ground at the @entity20 end when a massive crowd built up at the turnstiles with those at the front being crushed and ‘ screaming for help ’			1
he said : ‘ i just could not understand what i was seeing because it was unprecedented			0
what i would say , i froze , in fact i was gobsmacked			0
it was an alarming situation			0
‘ one guy i remember getting hold of my anorak and saying , “ do something , people are getting crushed , open the gates ”			0

he said he ‘ assumed ’ there would be a controlled opening of the gates to allow fans to filter into the ground , but was left surprised when @entity36 was ‘ flung open wide ’ at 2.52pm			2
