the @entity44 statistical bulletin said : ‘ adverse weather ( heavy snowfalls ) experienced in the first and last quarters of 2010 but not in 2011 are likely to be a factor in the increase in serious road casualties and fatalities recorded in 2011			0
’ transport secretary @entity20 told the @entity66 : ‘ we had some exceptional weather in that period and that was one of the reasons why there was such a change			0
’ road safety minister @entity73 said @entity5 ’s roads are still among the safest in the world but was ‘ disappointed ’ at the figures , adding : ’ any road death or injury is a tragedy and i will continue to take urgent action to crack down on the most dangerous drivers while improving the training to make our roads safer for everyone			1

weather : transport secretary @entity20 cited the harsh winter as a factor they are a demonstration of the concern that all of us have expressed about the lack of leadership , priority and resources given to road safety by the current government			0

’ professor @entity136 , director of the @entity29 , said the figures were ‘ sobering ’ and questioned whether the use by pedestrians and drivers of distracting iphones , ipods and smart phones to text and surf the internet was to blame			0
professor @entity136 said : ‘ it is notable that car drivers and passengers make up less than half of those killed , with pedestrians in particular also paying a heavy price in terms of lives lost			0
‘ we need to know why this is			0
is it due to more and more people being distracted by using mobile phones and listening to music ? ’ @entity161 head of road safety @entity160 said : ‘ it may well be that the weather in 2010 did make that year ’s figures look good			2
but we also have to suspect that the price of fuel throughout 2011 is all that has prevented road casualties for 2011 being much , much higher than in 2010			0
