by @entity0 published : 21:41 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 15 october 2013 before he was admittedly trying to ' screw ' his business partners out of the company they helped found , @entity2 co-creator @entity1 had a softer side - one in which he shared his feelings of love , loss , beauty and his affinity for @entity11 in the form of poetry he posted on the @entity15			1
as @entity2 is about to become a publicly traded company - and @entity1 is poised to make hundreds of millions of dollars - his internet poetry has long been erased from his personal website			1
but his web - based musings live on through a website called @entity21			2
much of the poetry and random streams of consciousness were posted to @entity1 's site about a decade ago , just a few short years before he and @entity2 co-founders @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 launched their uber - popular social media website			1
dapper : @entity2 founder has abandoned his teenage angst for fancy clothes and ruthless business tactics sensitive artist : before ' screwing ' his co-founders , @entity1 wrote sappy poetry and posted it on his personal website sensitive : in one of @entity1 's poems , he simply writes ' give me the courage to forget my ... ' on beauty , a far - more sensitive @entity1 than the man who forced @entity28 out of @entity2 - after he was essential in bringing the site to fruition - laments , ' beautiful people , but none for me			1
i find my beauty behind broken key			0
' in a poem @entity1 entitled ' find yourself , ' the conniving entrepreneur writes of inadequacy and his dissatisfaction of everyday life			0
' find yourself amongst the train yard where the freights bring the winds brings that rapidly approaching dust storm to your eyes sitting in the forgotten lazy - boy strewn over discarded liquor bottles			0
can you please toot your horn for me ? ' he writes			0
' screwed ' : @entity1 admits that he tried to ' screw ' business partners @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 out of their share of credit for @entity2 secretary : while @entity1 is expected to make hundreds of millions of dollars when @entity2 goes public , @entity28 is expected to make ' as much as @entity1 's secretary ' the poem goes on to describe @entity1 's disconnect with a 9 - 5 lifestyle , before he concludes the piece with ' this is going nowhere and you 're smacked into 5 oclock realization that neither are you			1
' in another rather cryptically titled nugget of @entity80 wisdom entitled ' forget , ' @entity1 leaves readers guessing with a simple , seven - word vignette			0
' give me the courage to forget my ... ' he writes			0
@entity1 's sensitive side does n't appear to carry over into the business world , however , as it is being revealed that he is a ruthless corporate shark who abandoned his teenage angst and rebellious blue hair for cut - throat business dealings and @entity91 dress shirts			1
in a scathing excerpt from the upcoming book @entity2 : a @entity95 that was published in the @entity96 last week , author @entity94 tells the story of how @entity1 ' forced out the man who was arguably @entity2 ’s most influential co-founder before the site took off			2
' that man was @entity28 , whom - when @entity2 goes public - @entity101 suspects will ' make about as much as @entity1 's secretary , ' as @entity1 himself will make several hundred million dollars			1
co-founder : @entity1 admits that he may have been trying to ' screw ' over co-founder @entity27			1
@entity27 , however , still stands to make close to a billion dollars from @entity2 besides the money , @entity94 argues that @entity1 has re-written history in terms of how @entity2 was started , and who should get the credit			1
' in dozens of interviews , @entity1 completely erased @entity28 from any involvement in the genesis of the company , ' @entity94 writes			0
' he changed his biography on @entity2 to “ inventor ” ; before long , he started to exclude @entity27 and @entity29 too			0
at an event , @entity1 complained to @entity116 that he had founded @entity2 , a point she raised the next day on the view with @entity29 and @entity27			2
@entity1 told the @entity120 that “ @entity2 has been my life ’s work in many senses			2
” he also failed to credit @entity28 for the company ’s unusual name			0
' of course , @entity94 's narrative remains a far - cry from the @entity1 who - less than a decade ago - wrote a poem he entitled @entity128 , in which he wrote ' we 'll give our creation to the first street dweller we stumble upon ... remember to follow the rules			2
' unless , of course , that street dweller is @entity28 .			0

@entity1 's *collegiate* poetry has been deleted from his website , but lives on on the website @entity21
@entity1 admits he may have tried to ' screw ' his @entity2 co-founders out of the business
@entity2 is about to go public and @entity1 is expected to make hundreds of millions of dollars . one of his co-founders is expected to ' make about as much as @entity1 's secretary '
