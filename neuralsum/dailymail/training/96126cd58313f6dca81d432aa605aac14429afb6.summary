by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:46 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:39 est , 24 december 2013 councils have blown thousands of pounds recruiting @entity5 cast - offs and z - list reality television stars to switch on their @entity8 lights this winter			1

local authorities have blown taxpayers money to hire stars to turn up at cheesy staff awards ceremonies , sports centre opening ceremonies and public events			1
the figures were branded ' astonishing ' by critics as they have come at a time when budgets have been slashed			0
the total spend could be far higher as 98 out of 434 councils surveyed by the @entity41 failed to provide a response to the request			0
payday : former @entity5 winner @entity11 was paid £ 5,000 to switch on the @entity8 lights in @entity13 last month in @entity28 , z - list @entity71 ' @entity24 was given £ 7,000 plus £ 132 for flights and £ 150 for travel - all for just one hour of work			1
he turned on the @entity8 lights but decided he was too ' tired ' to meet hundreds of fans who queued outside a restaurant			1
instead , his team invited just 30 people at the front of the queue along to the three - star @entity81 in @entity28 where he spent half an hour signing autographs before swiftly flying home			1
former @entity86 star @entity85 - who was famous in the 1990s - was paid £ 2,500 by @entity87 , in @entity88 , to perform six songs and turn on the lights			1
and the crowds in @entity92 , @entity93 , could be forgiven for asking ' who ? ' when an unfamiliar face hosted a @entity96 last month			0
@entity97 , who won the @entity98 off in 2011 , was paid £ 1,500 to turn up			1
shamed broadcaster @entity99 was paid £ 4,800 to open a white water course in @entity101 , @entity102			1
the 83 - year - old , who is currently serving a 30 - month jail term for sexually abusing 13 girls over a period of nearly 20 years , was arrested months after making his appearance in march 2012			1
the @entity108 also attended the event at the queen elizabeth ii @entity110			0

they were used in a cheesy @entity134 and videos of their ' road test ' were published on @entity137			0
five councils across @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 shared the cost of the project			2
in a press release put out by @entity145 , @entity124 was quoted as saying : ' anyone can drive fast - you stick the pedal to the floor and go			2
' the skill is in stopping and your reactions to stopping and to the cars around you			0
' video : @entity123 and @entity124 are paid £ 8,500 of taxpayers ' money to promote road safety one of the biggest names to be hired was @entity161 who attended a walking festival twice - at a cost of more than £ 11,000 to @entity165			1
in 2010 , he was paid £ 5,967 including expenses to appear at the annual event - and then £ 5,500 plus £ 250 expenses to attend the same event this year , @entity170 , chief executive of the @entity171 , said that councils should stop wasting money on minor celebrities			1
he said : ' this is an astonishing bill for taxpayers to foot			0
everyone wants to enjoy @entity8 and lights in town centres are often part of the festivities , but that does n't mean hard - pressed families should have to fork out for minor celebrities to come and switch them on			1
' if businesses genuinely believe having z - listers turn on the lights helps bring shoppers to the area , perhaps they could all stick some money in the kitty themselves			2
' councils are dealing with tighter budgets and have to cut out wasteful spending like this			0
' a spokesman for @entity28 and @entity196 said that hiring @entity24 from @entity25 got more people to go shopping in the town centre			1
' the decision to pay fees to attract a top line - up of entertainment for the @entity204 has been totally vindicated by the overwhelming success of the event , ' he said			0
' around 90,000 people visited @entity28 on saturday 23 november , with 26,000 in the city centre during the peak hour of 5 - 6pm when the switch - on took place			1
' not only did we see a 73 per cent increase in footfall for the day compared to last year , but also significantly improved footfall in the days leading up to the event			0
' payday : @entity219 presenter @entity218 was paid £ 5,000 by @entity220 to talk about grassland management in 2011 payday : the @entity219 's ' voice of athletics ' @entity224 was paid £ 1,500 to interview @entity226 - while the @entity228 star gave up his time for free a @entity228 hero opened a council sports centre for free - while a @entity219 commentator was paid £ 1,500 to interview him at the event			1
@entity226 - who was one of the stars of the 2012 @entity236 games - opened the @entity237 in @entity238 , south @entity236 for free after it underwent an £ 11million refurbishment			2
but while the disabled athlete gave up his time for free , @entity224 , who is known as the @entity219 's voice of athletics , pocketed a fee to appear on stage at the event in february			1
@entity226 , who is known as the @entity246 , has won six @entity228 gold medals including four in @entity236 last summer			2
he has also won the @entity236 marathon a record - breaking six times after being born with a spinal condition that left him unable to use his legs			0
the athlete lives in @entity238 and regularly trains at the council 's facilities so was happy to give his time up for free			2
@entity224 on the other hand is a retired hammer - thrower who competed in the @entity260 in 1976 and 1980 before joining the @entity219 after his retirement			1
as well as commentating on athletics he commentated on the @entity219 's heavily - criticised coverage of the @entity264 last year			2
at one point during his commentary , he said : ' @entity267 is about as iconic as it gets '			0
mr @entity224 , mr @entity226 and town mayor @entity268 all appeared on stage together at the sports centre opening			1
a spokesman for @entity224 refused to comment			0
a spokesman for @entity274 said : ' @entity224 hosted the reopening of the @entity237 in february following a major upgrade which included new sports facilities and a new library			2
' his role included being the compere , giving a speech and interviewing @entity226			0
' this is the only time in the past three years that we have paid for a celebrity to host an event			2
' in this case , the cost was deemed worthwhile because the event promoted the new facilities to a wide audience and encouraged families to lead healthier lives as part of our @entity260 legacy ambitions			2
' a council spent nearly £ 300,000 hiring celebrities to perform at free concerts in just over three years , figures have revealed			1
@entity47 paid x-factor ' stars ' @entity301 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity11 and @entity304 to appear at the annual event			0
critics said the day - long parties are of dubious benefit to the area - at a time when other council - run services are cut back			2
' star ' : former x-factor winner @entity303 was among the actors paid to appear at an taxpayer - funded concert put on by a council at a time when other budgets are being cut the authority has axed 1,200 jobs and been forced to make £ 48million of savings since 2010 - but the taxpayer - funded knees up has escaped the chop			1
the council hosts the free @entity326 each year in an effort to boost tourism			2
free concert : @entity301 was paid to appear at the @entity330 at their free annual concert the authority refused to give a full breakdown of how much each act was paid and claimed it was ' confidential ' and ' personal data '			1
@entity41 explained to them that other councils had released the data in full and had not claimed it could be kept secret			0
@entity340 , director of the @entity341 , said : ' for a council in that part of the world to be spending that kind of money is conspicuous			0
' they may try and argue that spending that money on concerts will cheer people up			0
the key issue is accountability for spending public money			0
' the council spent £ 54,850 on hiring celebrities in 2010 , £ 48,950 in 2011 , £ 51,000 in 2012 and £ 130,800 this year			1
although they released a full list of names of everyone who was paid to show up - they did not give a breakdown of the fees			2
a spokesman for the council said : ' @entity364 stages a hugely popular summer festival , attracting around 100,000 visitors to our borough every year			0
' tourism supports thousands of jobs in @entity330 , and visitors to our seafront festival spent an estimated £ 1.3million with local businesses last year alone			1
' it would not be appropriate to publish details of the fees paid to individual performers			0
if the @entity47 published details of a commercial agreement that we have been able to secure at an exceptional rate , it will affect future negotiations and earnings elsewhere for the artists and therefore make performers in general less willing to agree to special deals			0
