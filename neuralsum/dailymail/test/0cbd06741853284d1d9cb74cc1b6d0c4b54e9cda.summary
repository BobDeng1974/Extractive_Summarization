in this day and age , everything is personalised - from alarm clocks that measure your perfect amount of sleep to fashion brands that use social media to connect with each individual customer			1
so it was only a matter of time before the make - up industry jumped on the bandwagon			0
the newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs - from bespoke mascaras and eyeliners to foundations and powders unique to you			1
at @entity38 's @entity37 in @entity24 's @entity39 , which launched earlier this month , customers can choose between dozens of brush shapes - from thick wands for a dramatic @entity42 look to skinnier ones for lengthened , separated lashes			1
the mascaras , containing natural ingredients like conditioning shea butter and hydrating keratin , are created on site and then wrapped in monogrammed packaging to complete the personalised theme			2
co-founder @entity52 said : ' it 's like the @entity54 of mascara			2
getting it right is about the combination			0
one does n’t work without the other			0
' even if you have an amazing brush for you , if it ’s put together with the wrong formula then it does n’t work			0
' foundation , too , is set to see a surge in personalisation			2
beauty brands have long promised customised foundation , but finding that perfect shade and texture is easier said than done			1
enter @entity71 ( £ 36 ) a new game - changing alternative to foundation which can transform your entire make - up collection			0
cover drops , which are based on a colour palette of neutral , pink and gold , can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturisers , oils , serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish			0
using ' @entity89 ' technology , as soon as the drops are added to a beauty product , they blend in flawlessly , leaving behind only pure pigments and instant tint			0
@entity71 ( £ 36 ) can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturizers , oils , serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish it 's not just make - up that is increasingly becoming tailored to your personal needs			1
skincare brand @entity103 offers customised moisturisers , serums , cleansers and toners made with the particular ingredients that your skin craves			0
customers who visit the @entity103 website specify their gender , age , problem areas , preferred scent and skin sensitivities , among other options			0
they are then presented with a selection of made - to - order products designed to enhance their particular skin type , with prices starting at £ 20 for a custom - made toner			0
not only are beauty brands creating more and more customised products , but shops and department stores are also taking note of the bespoke trend by launching services to help customers create their own blends			1
@entity39 ' newly - launched @entity133 ( pictured ) is a personal shopping service for make - up @entity39 ' newly - launched @entity133 , for instance , is like a personal shopping service specifically for make - up			2
customers who book a complimentary appointment meet with a @entity141 , whose mission it is to seek out your ideal lipstick , fragrance or skincare , with no bias towards particular brands			1
according to @entity152 , group beauty buying director at @entity39 , bespoke products are most certainly the future of beauty - and customisation is only going to get bigger			1
' i think the one size fits all concept just simply does n’t cater to customers ’ individual needs at all times anymore , ' she explained			1
' whilst there is still definitely a market for ready - to - wear beauty , we are seeing an increase in our customers wanting to know that the product they are using is right for them ; many do n’t want to learn this through a process of trial and error			2

@entity37 mascara and foundation are part of the newest generation of personalised beauty products
skincare brands are also increasingly tailored to specific needs
@entity39 says ' one size fits all concept simply does *n't* cater to customers ’ individual needs at all times anymore '
