by @entity1 reporter published : 01:05 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 01:06 est , 2 july 2012 the thrilling @entity3 athletic heat which ended in a tie will be re-run today to decide which runner will make it to the @entity7 in @entity8 this summer			1
the two female sprinters involved in the dead heat were offered the chance to decide their fate with the toss of a coin , but opted to rely on their athletic ability instead			1
however , @entity16 insists that the winner - take - all race - which will be held at 5pm local time at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 - is unnecessary , as she won fair and square			1
the young sprinter wants no part of a run - off with training partner @entity26 to settle the last spot for the @entity7 in the women 's 100 metres			1
too close to call : @entity16 ( bottom ) and @entity26 both cross the finish line for the @entity3 trials with a time of 11.068			1
the race is decided by when their torsos cross the line , and the picture showed a tie ' in my heart of hearts , i just feel like i earned the third spot			1
i almost feel like i was kind of robbed , ' @entity16 said			1
@entity16 was originally declared the third - place finisher of the event on june 23 , even going on a celebratory lap around the track , being presented a medal and then showing up at a news conference			1
only after her drug test did she discover the controversy - race officials had declared a dead heat			1
now , after not making the team in the 200m , @entity16 has to regroup and step up to the starting line , trying to reclaim a spot she believed rightfully belongs to her			1
battle : the track timer had initially named @entity16 , right , as the winner before officials reviewed the results ' i 'm not that excited at all			1
this decision was really hard for me to make , ' said @entity16 , who is eligible to run on the @entity3 400m relay team			1
' i was pushed into a corner			1
they said if you do n't make a decision , you give your spot up			2
i work too hard to just give my spot up			2
i had to say it was a runoff			2
' the controversy in the 100 overshadowed the entire trials simply because @entity73 had no protocol in place to deal with a dead heat			2
@entity73 officials quickly scrambled to adopt a tiebreaking procedure			2
the athletes had a choice between a runoff or a coin flip			2
they chose to settle matters on the track , not with the flip of a quarter			2
' they both feel they deserve a spot on the team and they 're willing to do it in a competitive manner and a competitive fashion , ' @entity73 president @entity86 said			2
' i think it 's good for the sport and it 's good for them to show their level of competitiveness and passion and drive for what they 've been working so hard to accomplish			2
' the bottom line is that this is , in my opinion , the best way to be able to resolve this issue			2
' disbelief : the two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women 's 100m @entity3 team the resolution was delayed for eight days because their coach , @entity114 , wanted to wait to make a decision until after 200m on saturday			0
@entity116 turned in a personal - best time of 21.69 seconds , the fourth - fastest by an @entity118			0
' i did n't get to really enjoy it , ' @entity116 said			0
' as soon as i came off , that 's the first time that i actually thought about the process			0
of course , i was n't thinking i wanted to do a coin toss , but that 's the first time i sat down and went through things in my head			0
' once this is over , i 'll be happy about it			0
' after two races and six rounds , both will be running with fatigued legs - so much so that @entity116 said she wo n't take any chances			0
if she steps into the blocks and does not feel right , she will pull out of the competition			0
' we 're both not feeling our greatest , ' @entity116 said			0
for @entity16 , there is also an emotional component			1
' i went to bed so happy and then i woke up to do something i do n't want to do at all , ' @entity16 said			1
' if it 's in the best interest of someone 's job or the sport , that 's what i 'll do			0
' support : the two women have the same trainer and contracts with @entity152 anxious : @entity116 ( right ) is keen to compete in the @entity3 100m even though her main event is 200m @entity16 's agent @entity156 was asked if there might be any sort of legal recourse should her clieent not win the race			1
' i 'll have a sidebar conversation with @entity16 and see how she wants to proceed , meaning if it 's really over with the run , ' @entity156 said			1
@entity16 indicated the matter would be concluded with the runoff			1
' i would n't want to pursue anything else , ' she said			0
' this has been a long road already			0
' as for their friendship , @entity116 said it has not been affected by the situation			0
they both train under @entity114 and were practicing starts together leading up to the 200m			0
' there 's never any question about any of that , ' @entity116 said			0
since @entity116 had already earned a spot in the 200m , there was speculation she might simply concede the 100m to @entity16			1
but @entity116 said the 100m is vital to her preparation for the 200m , where she 's a favorite to win @entity3 gold			0
' people may wonder , " what in the world ? @entity193 ( of @entity194 ) ran 10.70 and you 're nowhere close to that , " ' @entity116 said			0
' but it 's about making my 200m better and giving it my all			0
' the runoff is a boon for track and will be shown on @entity204 in conjunction with the network 's coverage of the swimming trials			0
' this will reintroduce people to the sport and showcase world - class athletes and great competition , ' newly hired ceo @entity209 said .			0

@entity26 and @entity16 will face off for a ticket to @entity217
