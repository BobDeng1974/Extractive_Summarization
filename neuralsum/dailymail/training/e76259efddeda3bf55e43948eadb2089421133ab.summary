by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 13:42 est , 18 november 2013 this is the extraordinary moment two mothers swapped their babies back again , following an appalling maternity hospital mix - up meant they took home the wrong daughters			1
the women , who are both called @entity10 and were given @entity12 operations at the same time in a @entity14 hospital , breast fed and bonded with each other 's children			1
the handover came 102 days after their births , in the same maternity clinic which had committed the blunder			2
both women described their ordeal as ' deeply traumatic '			2
@entity37 , 32 , said her marriage was almost wrecked because when a dna test showed ' her ' child did not belong to her husband , he feared she had been unfaithful and threatened divorce			1
from soon after their @entity12 operations on 6 august , both she and @entity23 , 28 , suspected they had been given the wrong daughters - @entity47 and @entity48 respectively - but their hospital in @entity50 told them such a mistake was impossible			1
even when the women paid for their own dna tests - which proved the error - the hospital kept insisting no switch had occurred , and it took a formal complaint to the police by @entity23 to force medics to accept the mothers were right			1
finally , late last week the hospital accepted its mistake , firing the staff responsible , and offering the women all possible help - starting during the weekend - in exchanging the children they have loved and cherished for more than three months , and helping each other get to know their real babies			1
@entity23 , pictured with her baby @entity47 , reported the hospital to police after they refused to admit their error @entity22 said her marriage was almost destroyed when a dna test showed her husband was not the father of the baby she took home from hospital ' @entity76 ( hello , hello ! ) ' , said @entity77 to her real baby , holding her properly for the first time			1
' she likes to sing and smile , and to chat			0
' sitting next to her , the other @entity10 was speechless , but kept one hand softly touching @entity47 , who she has raised and will now lose			1
' i realised the baby that was brought to me ... was not mine , ' said @entity23			1
' of course i feel hard about giving @entity48 away ... i was breastfeeding her			1
' but with my all heart , and with my mind , i understand that my true own baby was there and i must get her to me			2
' the women have become close as they challenged a medical establishment that for weeks refused to admit its error			1
@entity23 , said she knew with ' all her heart ' she had been given the wrong baby they realised that @entity48 looked like a ' replica ' of @entity37 's elder daughter , and @entity47 was the image of @entity23 's son			1
overwhelmed with emotion , @entity100 , sitting side by side with her fellow victim , said : ' @entity10 is more than a sister for me now , more than a relative			1
and the babies ... what can we say ? this one is my darling , my dear one - and that one is too			2
' we are helping each other now and will be raising them together			0
the only trouble is that we do not even live in the same city , and it takes time to get to each other			0
but we are now bound by a very , very special bond			0
we will always be connected			0
' earlier , @entity37 , 32 , explained how they suffered every woman 's nightmare			1
' we were operated on at the same time in the same surgical theatre			0
our kids were born within minute of each other , ' she said			1
' when i went for my scan during my pregnancy , i was told my baby should weigh 3,600 grams at birth but the child they brought me was only 2,800			1
' after being sent home with the wrong children , they kept in contact , and as their babies got bigger , they only become more certain that an appalling mistake had been committed			1
@entity37 , 32 , said : ' the dna results came back and showed that my husband @entity140 was not the father			1
of course , we argued and debated			0
there were constant scandals in our home , and it almost came to divorce			0
' the other @entity10 said she and her husband @entity148 also faced misery over the swap			1
' it is very , very heavy			0
it is really heart breaking			0
' it was clear that my daughter did not look like me or my husband			2
but the health workers did not want to admit their mistake			1
' i exchanged photos with @entity10 , and as the girls got older , it became more obvious that they were not similar to our older children			1
' i shed so many tears , and lost weight			0
' @entity23 , with husband @entity168 , said baby @entity47 was the spitting image of her son she added : ' right after the birth , i asked to see my daughter and knew immediately that something was wrong because she did not look like us			1
' i asked to show me @entity37 's child - and saw that she was a copy of my son			2
' initially the hospital claimed the dna tests did not amount to proper evidence because they were from a private clinic			2
as police probed the blunder , hospital chiefs conceded and fired the chief of delivery ward @entity185 , along with an unnamed midwife			1
the head doctor @entity188 was reprimanded			0
@entity23 said : ' i think there were two reasons for the mistake			1
first , we have the same names @entity194 , and the medical staff did not pay proper attention to our family names			0
' second , there was only a minute 's difference between the births			2
' the nurses may have been distracted and confused the babies , or perhaps it happened when they put on their tags			2
' @entity205 , chief doctor of the @entity206 in @entity50 , said the mothers ' were admitted into one spacious room , and they swapped their babies and started getting used to them			2
' psychologists are working with the mothers , and babies are under constant supervision and control			0
all our clinic 's specialists are working to make sure everything is fine with them			0
so far both babies are doing well			0
@entity23 said the trauma has cemented her friendship with @entity37 ' the mothers have found a common language , the mood is calm in their room			1
' but they all need time to get used to each other , and it was at the request of both mothers that we put them all in one room			0
' the mothers help each with everything they can , from suggesting a right lullaby to what position to hold the baby during breastfeeding , to the words the they are used to hearing in their first almost four months , such as what are their habits , likes and dislikes , and so on			0
' they will stay at the hospital for as long as they need			0
' she said the hospital was seeking a ' peace deal ' with the mothers over the scandal			0
by refusing to accept the doctors ' denials , the two mothers avoided years of agony - which still continues - for two @entity14 familes who only discovered a similar mix - up when their daughters were aged 12			0
in this case , @entity261 , 32 , found that she was raising a daughter born to another mother in the maternity hospital			2
after conducting her own detective work , she tracked down her real daughter , now being raised by the other mother 's ex-husband , who was the real father to her daughter			0
after navigating the initial trauma , the families decided they could not tear the girls away from the world 's they know - one family is @entity277 , the other @entity278			0
' we try to cope , we see each other , but it is so hard , and i feel no - one knows my agony			0
i could not give up my @entity285 , just as i can never come to terms that i will never be able to raise @entity48 , who i gave birth to , and is made from me , as my own daughter			2
' all we can do is try to make the best of it			0
' a number of similar cases have come to light in the @entity294 with experts also warning that the true number of such mix - ups will never be known .			0
