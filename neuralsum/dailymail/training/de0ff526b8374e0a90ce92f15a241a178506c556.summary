by @entity0 last updated at 9:05 am on 25th november 2011 three executives of @entity3 's @entity2 resigned today ahead of a boardroom showdown with ousted ceo @entity5 , as the @entity7 whistleblower said he would not be surprised if ‘ some criminality ’ were involved in the scandal engulfing the once - venerable firm			1

‘ i 'm immensely encouraged			0
i 've been treated with great courtesy and i 'm much more confident than i thought i would be with what i 've been told			0

do n't look for self - interest , look for the 45,000 people			0
‘ have some shame , have some dignity , that 's what i want to tell them			0
’ @entity5 later welcomed the resignations of @entity89 and the other two executives , but told an audience of business people that the entire current board should resign			1
probe : @entity5 says the @entity23 police have a big role to play in uncovering the truth ‘ if they have an iota of care for the company then they should realise what they have done and give assurances they will resign in the near future , ’ said an animated @entity5 , who also criticised @entity3 shareholders for their relative silence and @entity3 media for their slow start to covering the scandal			1
@entity2 fired @entity5 as ceo , asserting he did not understand @entity3 culture or the firm 's management style			1
