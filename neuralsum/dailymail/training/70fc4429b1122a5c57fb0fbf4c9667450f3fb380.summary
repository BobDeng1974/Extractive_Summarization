@entity0 , from @entity1 in @entity2 , had breast cancer at 40 even when it 's raining , @entity0 refuses her husband 's offer of a lift to work			1
she 'd rather take the 20 - minute walk because she is determined to stay well			2
the 45 - year - old shop assistant from @entity1 in @entity2 has n't always been so conscientious about her health			1
for years until recently she often spent her evenings on the sofa munching fatty snacks in front of the tv , even after a meal			0
by her late 30s she was 16st			2
at 5ft 10in her @entity17 was over 32 - officially obese			1
' i felt sluggish and tired , but i put it down to the fact i was getting older			0
' then when she was 40 , she noticed a lump by her right nipple			2
to her horror , tests showed it was breast cancer			1
' they told me they had caught it early , but all i could think about was my son , @entity30			0
he was only 14 , and i just kept thinking : " i 'm never going to see him grow up or have a family " , ' says @entity0 , who is married to @entity34 , 53 , a printer			1
after her diagnosis in september 2009 , @entity0 underwent a lumpectomy , chemotherapy and then , in february 2010 , radiotherapy			1
doctors gave her a good prognosis , but she was concerned that the cancer might return			2
she was told she 'd be given the drug tamoxifen and six - monthly mammograms , but she wanted more reassurance			2
then , in march 2010 , during an appointment a doctor said something that resonated			0
' she said : " you have another chance at life if you change your lifestyle			2
" it really hit home			0
' there are more cancer survivors like @entity0 than ever before - two million in the @entity57			1
forty years ago , three - quarters of people diagnosed with cancer died within ten years			1
now , according to the latest figures from @entity61 , half of all those diagnosed with cancer will be alive ten years later			2
however , people who have had cancer once are statistically more likely to get it again			2
this may be because the treatment itself , such as radiotherapy , increases the risk of another cancer , or because the lifestyle factor that contributed to their cancer in the first place is still not addressed			1
they are also more prone to other diseases such as heart disease , stroke , diabetes and osteoporosis			0
this , too , can sometimes be due to cancer treatment			0
@entity0 pictured with her mother , @entity85 , while @entity0 had cancer for example certain cancer drugs weaken bones , raising the risk of osteoporosis ; and women who have had breast cancer treatment are prone to putting on weight due to steroid or hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen , and this may increase the risk of diabetes			1
a report published last week by the charity @entity102 revealed that one in four patients faces long - term illness or disability as a result of treatment for the disease			0
now , however , scientists are starting to identify what can be done to help keep former cancer patients well and reduce their risk of cancer returning			1
' research has been accelerating rapidly , ' says dr @entity115 , an epidemiologist based at @entity116 , @entity117 , who has studied how to improve quantity and quality of life for cancer survivors			0
' whereas the @entity124 [ the global authority on cancer ] has been issuing advice on cancer prevention for years , only in the past two years have they issued advice on survivorship as they feel they finally have enough information to make recommendations			0
' these include eating a largely plant - based diet , maintaining a healthy weight and getting regular physical activity			1
following these guidelines can reduce the risk of cancer recurring two to three fold , and can reduce the risk of illness from cancer or other causes by 34 per cent , says dr @entity145 , a dietitian who has conducted cancer research and works at @entity147			1
meanwhile , a study published in the @entity149 in 2012 found that a diet with a high intake of vegetables , fruit , vegetable oil , and soups reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 29 per cent compared with a standard @entity159 diet high in red and processed meat and deep fried foods			1
now , she used every ounce of determination to slim down to 13st why is still not clear , but one emerging theory is that these foods trigger inflammation , which can boost cancer cell growth			1
but it is physical activity that provides some of the best evidence for helping cancer survivors			0
the authors of a report for @entity102 refer to it as the ' underrated wonder drug '			0
last year experts at @entity178 calculated that walking a mile a day at a steady 3mph - roughly a 30 - minute walk - could cut the risk of breast cancer recurring by 40 per cent			1
and for women actually undergoing breast cancer treatment it could cut the risk of dying from the disease by 40 per cent			1
meanwhile , a @entity188 study in the @entity189 in 2011 , which followed more than 2,000 prostate cancer survivors over 18 years , found that those who did more than three hours a week of vigorous activity such as swimming , tennis or cycling cut their risk of dying from their cancer by 61 per cent			1
bowel cancer patients who do around six hours of moderate intensity physical activity a week such as cycling , jogging or walking could help reduce their risk of dying from the disease by around 50 per cent , according to a review of 60 studies entitled @entity206 on @entity207			1
quite why exercise should be so effective at preventing cancer returning is unclear , says professor @entity210 a consultant oncologist and joint medical officer for @entity178			0
it 's not simply about keeping weight down ( being overweight is a risk factor for some cancers , including breast )			2
' physical activity has an impact as it can reduce levels of hormones such as oestrogen that are known to stimulate cancer			0
another theory is that exercise reduces inflammation and makes it harder for cancer cells to take hold and grow			0
' for dr @entity115 , ' the surprising thing is that despite this new emerging research about the benefits of lifestyle , researchers ' focus is still on drugs - unlike drugs , lifestyle options have no side - effects and the benefits are enormous '			1
indeed a healthy lifestyle can have an effect ' comparable to drugs , ' adds professor @entity245			1
' that is not to say they can replace them - but they do have a comparable effect			1
' she now encourages all but her very ill patients to stay active throughout their treatment and beyond			0
' having looked at the data i now always recommend physical activity , ' she says			0
' walking can make a big difference and it is so simple			0
you do n't have to slip into @entity261 and go to the gym every day to make this impact , any form of physical activity helps			0
' pictured with her husband @entity34 and son @entity266 while she had cancer considering the benefits from diet and exercise , experts say not enough patients are issued with this advice			0
currently , only those with certain types of cancer , for instance colon or stomach , are routinely given advice about what to eat , says dr @entity145			0
' at the moment patients often get their advice from the tv or the media or magazines , whereas it would be better if it came from health professionals			0
' and yet a survey by @entity291 health professionals , found that one in ten still believed it more important for patients to rest during treatment - when the key seems to be staying active not just after treatment but during it , too			0
only 6 per cent tell patients of the benefits of physical activity - and half admit they know little if anything about the benefits for cancer patients			1
professor @entity245 says things have improved slightly since this survey was conducted in 2011 , with more gps and oncologists now giving exercise advice , but adds : ' it is still the case that advice about exercise is not being included in information for patients			0
' the proportion of breast , prostate and skin cancer sufferers alive five years after diagnosis @entity188 research shows that support is crucial , with those given counselling about how to lose weight and get more physically active , having lower levels of an inflammatory marker linked to breast cancer , than those just given a leaflet			1
yet too often a leaflet is all that patients such as @entity0 get			2
' i did n't really know what i should or should not be eating , so looked it up in books and on the internet , ' she says			0
' before cancer , my only vegetable intake was maybe some carrots with dinner , but now half my plate is vegetables of all kinds			0
' she also started walking , aiming to take 10,000 steps a day			2
now 45 , she used every ounce of determination to slim down to 13st			1
' when i went for my five years check - up the nurse said i had done really well and that by taking the weight off , and getting more active i had substantially reduced my risk of the cancer returning			1
' if i had n't changed my lifestyle - it could have been very different			2

half her plate is vegetables and she also started walking , aiming to take 10,000 steps a day			2

@entity0 , from @entity1 in @entity2 , had breast cancer at 40
at the time she was 16st . at 5ft 10in her @entity17 was over 32 - officially obese
now 45 , she used every ounce of determination to slim down to 13st
a healthy lifestyle can have an effect ' comparable to drugs '
walking a mile a day ' could cut the risk of cancer recurring by 40 per cent '
