a @entity1 woman has spoken of her shock at discovering her mother is an influential jihadist who helps suicide bombers and is known as @entity5			1
@entity6 was stunned when police knocked on her door to tell her that @entity9 had become a pivotal member of @entity11 , the @entity13 jihadists behind the @entity15 massacre in @entity16			1
mother - of - two ms @entity6 had cut off all contact from her strict @entity20 family five years earlier and fearful for her life , had changed her number , her name and hidden her whereabouts			1
' known as @entity5 , @entity9 allegedly ran a safe house for suicide bombers and @entity40 fighters recruited into the militant @entity42 organisation			1
the police officers told ms @entity6 , 34 , to @entity46 her mother 's name if she wanted to know why she was in trouble			1
she said : ' it was not until i got to work that i could @entity46 her name			2
there were all these pictures of people injured by suicide bombs			2
' as i read about what she 'd done i felt so alone			2
i could n't just turn to my colleagues and say , " guess what ? my mum 's a wanted terrorist			2
" ' i could n't believe my own mother was involved			1
i cried non-stop for days after that			2
' loving : @entity61 , pictured left with her mother , was born in the @entity13 capital @entity65 but now lives in @entity1			1
pictured right , @entity9 , now known as @entity5 , meets a soldier in @entity68 in 1984 in the three years since that earth - shattering day in july 2012 , ms @entity6 said : ' i 've grieved for her			1
it 's brought closure to any romantic idea about one day things being better with my mum			2
' i 've accepted i 'll never see her again			2
how could she ever explain that she 'd joined @entity11 ? ' it 's too terrible			1
i fear that one day i will see her on tv or i 'll get a knock on the door to say she 's been killed			2
but despite all the terrible things she 's done , she is still my mother			1
' for her own protection , we are not disclosing the details of ms @entity6 's current location or that of her family			1
but using contacts she has from @entity13 , where she was born , she discovered her mother married one of @entity11 's leaders			1
she added : ' i do n't know about my mother 's involvement with @entity40 recruits like @entity92 but i know it 's alleged			2
i think @entity5 is a horrible name			2
' oddly , though , ms @entity6 can see how her mother might have earned the chillingly affectionate title			1
she explained : ' she could be very kind and charming			2
i can see how natural it would be for her to be that motherly figure			2
' she is utterly devoted to what she believes in and being a wife of a jihadist is a way she can help as a woman			0
' tv appearance : mother - of - two @entity6 was recently interviewed about her ordeal on @entity107 's @entity106 but the image of her mother as @entity5 is a long way from the woman of ms @entity6 's earliest memories			1
she said : ' when i was little my mum loved fashion			0
she had these fantastic hairstyles			0
her brother lived in @entity117 and she would visit him and bring back all these amazing clothes			0

she even divorced my dad because she wanted to travel			0

by then ms @entity6 's mother had become more religious and her childhood more restrictive - being forced to wear the hijab at the age of six			1
when she was ten her family fled @entity13 after being granted refugee status in @entity134			1
but any hope of a @entity40 upbringing was quashed after she was enrolled in a strict @entity42 school			1
she said : ' suddenly i was was n't allowed to play with my male cousins			0
we were n't allowed to listen to music			0
' anything that was deemed frivolous , anything that took you away from the importance of @entity144 , was forbidden			0
' when she was 15 her mother split from her latest husband and took her and her five younger siblings to live in @entity149			2
it was only when she began studying for a degree in molecular biology that a new world opened up			0
' it was a revelation , ' she said			0
' i met atheists , @entity156 , jews , @entity158 - they challenged me about my views , and i about theirs			0
it was an incredible sensation to be able to discuss ideas without fear			0
' she felt in her heart that to be true to herself she could no longer call herself a @entity20			1
recalling the day she broached the subject with her family , ms @entity6 said : ' my mum 's first words were , " you 're going to hell ! " then my uncle flew over from @entity173 and for three days i was locked in the house and forced to listen to him			1
' when she failed to change her mind , her mother cut off all contact with her			1
she even left @entity1 and took the family to @entity180			1
she explained : ' she was petrified that the rest of my siblings would leave @entity42 like i had			1
i was a sheep lost to the wolves and she had to protect the rest of the flock			0

she stopped wearing a headscarf and started listening to music			0
the last time @entity61 saw her mother was at @entity149 train station in 2005 , shortly before she left			1
she said : ' it was my dream to get out and finally i had escaped			0
' it was a haze			0
i did n't know it would be the last time i would see her			0
we hugged but she made it clear i was putting her through a lot of pain			0
she was genuinely worried for my soul			0
' at that time her younger sister @entity208 was also leading a double life			0
' she 'd had a secret part - time job as a waitress and had a wardrobe of shorts and miniskirts			0
@entity119 found them and i knew @entity208 was in trouble ' , ms @entity6 adds			1
' i panicked and emailed her , saying no matter what , she must not to go to @entity13			1
i knew she 'd never leave if she did			0
' i was told to butt out if i knew what was good for me			0
a few weeks later my mother called me to say @entity208 was getting married in two days ' time			2
' the last time ms @entity6 spoke to her mother was in 2007			1
she said : ' she was preaching to me to over the phone			0
she kept saying " are you praying ? " she could n't accept that i had left @entity42			1
' i asked where she was and she said , " i ca n't tell you , i 'm being pursued by your infidel uncle			0
" she meant a friend of my father 's who was then president of @entity13			1
i realise she must have been in the thick of @entity11 even then			1
' by then ms @entity6 had met her husband , a @entity234 lawyer , at university but she had a sense of dread			1
she explained : ' i knew they would do what they could to prevent us being together			0
' i knew i would never be safe , that i was a thorn in my family 's side			2
so i changed my number and made sure they did n't know where i was living			0
' the white widow : ms @entity6 says she is uncertain of her mother 's involvement with @entity92 , a @entity1 woman who is one of the world 's most wanted female terror suspects at their wedding in 2010 none of her family were present			1
ms @entity6 said : ' it was tinged with sadness			1
i would have loved to have seen my mother there but there was no way she would ever have approved , especially of someone @entity234			2
' since finding out about her mother @entity263 has become a member of the @entity265 of @entity1 , speaking against radical @entity42 , and of @entity266 , a campaign group			1
her life now is one that she never thought she would have as a child			0
she says : ' all my dreams have come true			0
i have a wonderful family , an incredible husband and i just feel so fortunate			2
it 's the life i never thought i 'd have			0
' but i miss my siblings , especially my sister			0
