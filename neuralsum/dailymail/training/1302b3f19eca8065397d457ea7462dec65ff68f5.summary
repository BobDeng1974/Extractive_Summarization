dr @entity0 was about to replace a woman 's breast implants at the private @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , when he took the photo without her consent , a court heard			1
the consultant , the @entity22 ’s leading specialist for female genital cosmetic and reconstructive surgery , was suspended for 18 months by the @entity24 last april , pending investigation			1
but the @entity24 has now lifted the ban on practising and allowed dr @entity0 back to the operating theatre on tight conditions , including that he works with a chaperone			1
dr @entity0 , who has carried out more than 2,000 cosmetic surgical prodedures , applied to the @entity32 to have his suspension lifted , calling it ‘ disproportionate ’			2
ruling on the case , mr @entity35 said dr @entity0 was about to operate on a woman in february last year when her genitals caught his eye through her surgical underpants			2
‘ he commented on this anatomical feature to the staff present in the theatre and stated that he intended to photograph it , ’ the judge added			0
‘ he took a single photograph of the patient 's genitals , with the surgical underpants pulled aside and her legs in a natural position , together			0
he used the camera on his @entity9			0
‘ he did not have the patient 's prior consent to take the photograph			0
’ a ward matron found out about the photo and confronted dr @entity0 , who apologised and wrote to the patient , insisting he took the picture with the best intentions regarding her ‘ care pathway ’			2
dr @entity0 said his interest was professional , adding : ‘ i am always adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective patients and i was hoping , with your consent , to do so with yours			0
incident : dr @entity0 was about to replace a woman 's breast implants at the private @entity16 ( pictured ) in @entity17 , @entity18 , when he took the photo without her consent , a court heard decision : the consultant was suspended for 18 months by the @entity24 ( headquarters in @entity79 pictured ) last april , pending investigation ' i am always adding to my portfolio of different female genitalia to show prospective patients and i was hoping , with your consent , to do so with yours			1
i would have discussed this with you and , of course , had you objected , i would have disposed of the imagery immediately ' dr @entity0 ‘ i would have discussed this with you and , of course , had you objected , i would have disposed of the imagery immediately			0
’ the hospital suspended dr @entity0 from practising there last march , finding he ‘ acted inappropriately ’ , was in breach of good medical practice in failing to respect the patient 's dignity and that his actions had the potential to bring the hospital into disrepute			1
dr @entity0 was suspended for 18 months by the @entity24 but , at the @entity32 , his lawyer , @entity100 , argued the incident was isolated and there was no evidence of any risk of harm to patients			1
mr @entity35 accepted the panel had failed to properly hold the balance between patients ' rights and the devastating impact of the suspension on dr @entity0 and , in the light of that ruling , the @entity24 has now allowed him back to work			2
the @entity116 - the @entity24 's new tribunal service for @entity22 doctors which came into force last june - replaced the interim suspension with a conditional registration order			0
he can now practise again so long as he tells the body when he accepts a job , confines himself to plastic surgery , consults with female patients in the presence of another medic and refrains from photographing female genitalia without consent .			0
