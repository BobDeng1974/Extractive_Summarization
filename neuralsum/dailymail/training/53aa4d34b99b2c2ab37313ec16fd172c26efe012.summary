by @entity0 published : 15:51 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 04:52 est , 12 march 2013 a group of scientists clad in spacesuits trudge across the bleak red terrain , occasionally pausing to take rock samples or map the landscape			0
after their mission is complete , they will return to their cramped habitation module , where they live a spartan existence with limited water , electricity , food and oxygen , a vast distance from home			1
but these amazing pictures are not from the latest sci - fi thriller set on @entity20 , but were taken in the deserts of @entity22 , in the @entity23			2
the ' astronauts ' are a group of volunteers who are helping to discover ways to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of @entity20 and use the @entity22 desert 's @entity20 - like terrain to simulate working conditions on the red planet			1
all outdoor exploration is done wearing simulated spacesuits and carrying air supply packs and crews live together in a small communication base with carefully rationed essentials - everything needed to survive must be produced , fixed and replaced on - site			0
the site , near the town of @entity63 , was chosen because the terrain is similar to the surface of @entity20			0
it is operated by the @entity67 , a non-profit organisation that advocates space travel , during the cooler winter months by rotating volunteer crews of six scientists ( geologists , biologists , engineers and more ) running simulations of how it would be to live on @entity20 and working together to develop field tactics and study the terrain			1
alien terrain : @entity79 , a geologist and volunteer from @entity81			0
she has a life - long love of space exploration and is a board member of the @entity85 explorer : @entity87 , a mapping researcher and the health and safety officer of the mission , surveys the terrain from a ledge @entity93 ( left ) , a geologist and commander of the crew , climbs a rock formation to collect samples for study alone in the cosmos : @entity100 , executive officer and habitat engineer , takes pictures of the surface of ' @entity20 ' members of crew 125 @entity106 b mission collect geologic samples from a cliff face			2
@entity22 was chosen because it is believed to be geologically and visually similar to @entity20 the @entity37 aims to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of @entity20 and uses the @entity22 desert 's @entity20 - like terrain to simulate working conditions there each crew spends between two weeks and a month living in a habitat unit , performing the kind of work astronauts will be expected to carry out on @entity20 , such as collecting rock samples from the surface and examining them back in the habitat , conducting life science experiments and studying the local geology and geomorphology			1
a statement on the @entity37 website says : ' @entity20 is the great challenge of our time			1
' a world with a surface area the size of the combined continents of the @entity136 , the @entity131 contains all the elements needed to support life			0
as such it is the @entity140 for revealing whether the phenomenon of life is something unique to the @entity136 , or prevalent in the universe			0
red dusk : the weary spacefarers trudge back to the habitat after a day of collecting geologic samples homeward bound : @entity79 makes her way back to the @entity37 , where she lives in cramped conditions with five other astronauts @entity153 : the six volunteers live together in a small communications base with limited amounts of electricity , food , oxygen and water for safety reasons , there is always one crew member in the habitat in case anything goes wrong on the ' planet 's surface ' @entity168 : a view of the night sky above the @entity37 to be as authentic as possible , everything needed to survive must be produced , fixed and replaced on site , as it would on a real expedition to @entity20 ' the exploration of @entity20 may also tell us whether life as we find it on @entity136 is the model for life elsewhere , or whether we are just a small part of a much vaster and more varied tapestry			1
' moreover , as the nearest planet with all the required resources for technological civilisation , @entity20 will be the decisive trial that will determine whether humanity can expand from its globe of origin to enjoy the open frontiers and unlimited prospects available to multi-planet spacefaring species			2
' offering profound enlightenment to our science , inspiration and purpose to our youth , and a potentially unbounded future for our posterity , the challenge of @entity20 is one that we must embrace			0
' the crew wait in an airlock in their simulated spacesuits before venturing out to explore the ' @entity20 ' surface much of the research is to examine what is required of space suits on a manned mission to @entity20 another core component is to learn about the psychological stresses that may be endured by explorers as they deal with a lack of privacy and long periods of solitude cosy : the crew prepare a meal in the habitat			1
food must be carefully rationed as the volunteers are not resupplied once they enter the @entity37 @entity222 ( facing front ) , a rover engineer , works at his computer			2
the project attracts space enthusiasts and scientists from all over the world stellar work : geologists @entity93 ( left ) and @entity79 analyse geologic samples collected from outside the @entity22 site is one of two operated by the @entity67 as part of its @entity236 ( @entity20 ) project			2
the other site is located in the @entity238 , with two more planned for the @entity240 outback and @entity241			0
these locations were chosen because some environmental conditions , geologic features or biological attributes may be similar to those thought to be encountered on @entity20			2
the @entity37 website adds : ' in addition to providing scientific insight into our neighboring world , such analog environments offer unprecedented opportunities to carry out @entity20 analog field research in a variety of key scientific and engineering disciplines that will help prepare humans for the exploration of that planet			1
such research is vitally necessary			0
@entity262 ? engineer @entity222 works on a rover , which will be used to explore the surface of @entity22 , similar to the way a robot could be used by human explorers honour roll : names of past crew members are stuck on the doors of the crew bunks crew members with expertise in mapping and geology plan their excursion to collect rock samples			0
each crew member has their national flag on their uniform although this simple rock is from @entity22 , the samples on @entity20 could help humanity unlock the secrets of the @entity286 biology : @entity87 checks on plants grown at the @entity37			1
astronauts may have to grow their own food on manned missions to @entity20 a vintage map of @entity20 hangs on the wall at the @entity37			1
the mission is only made possible thanks to volunteers and donors , including film director @entity298 ' for example , it is one thing to walk around a factory test area in a new spacesuit prototype and show that a wearer can pick up a wrench - it is entirely another to subject that same suit to two months of real field work			2
' similarly , psychological studies of human factors issues , including isolation and habitat architecture are also only useful if the crew being studied is attempting to do real work			0
' mission commander @entity93 , who led a crew of six at the @entity22 site from february 23 to march 9 , said : ' humans , we are explorers â€¦ there are a lot of obstacles but we can overcome those obstacles			0
' @entity324 : the volunteers can spend up to a month enduring the austere conditions the @entity22 site is one of two operated by the @entity67 as part of its @entity236 ( @entity20 ) project			1
the other site is located in the @entity238 , with two more planned for the @entity240 outback and @entity241			0
starry - eyed : the site 's observatory as seen from the working and living quarters the @entity37 website says : '' offering profound enlightenment to our science , inspiration and purpose to our youth , and a potentially unbounded future for our posterity , the challenge of @entity20 is one that we must embrace '			1

the @entity37 intends to *recreate* conditions on the red planet
researchers use it to explore *possibility* of a manned mission to @entity20
the volunteers must stay inside a spacesuit outside while they conduct research
engineers , geologists , biologists and more live in cramped , austere conditions for weeks
