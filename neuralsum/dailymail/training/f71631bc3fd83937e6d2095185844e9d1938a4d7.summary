@entity0 has warned the @entity1 over taking @entity2 to next summer ’s under 21 @entity3			1
the @entity5 boss has a good relationship with @entity7 under 21 head coach @entity8 but he has also outlined his concerns over whether @entity2 has reached a point where that level of football is not suitable for him			2
@entity2 has only made brief cameos for @entity7 since making his debut against @entity15 in 2013 @entity8 has been told he can have the pick of @entity7 ’s young stars for the tournament in the @entity19 next june and it is likely he will include @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 in his squad			1
there is , however , a debate on @entity2 , who has been a fixture in @entity29 ’s squads but has not yet nailed down a starting place			0
@entity5 midfielder @entity2 has just returned to action after recovering from knee injury @entity8 has never had the chance to pick the @entity5 midfielder and @entity0 is wondering how he intends to handle the gifted 20 - year - old			1
‘ we need to remember what the reason is for playing for the @entity39 , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ it is to get you ready to play for the first team			0
the moment that you feel ready to play in the first team , going back in your development , i do n’t see how that can help ... @entity2 has gone past that ( @entity49 football ) completely			0

@entity8 has been told he can have the pick of @entity7 *'s* young stars for the tournament

@entity0 says @entity2 would be taking backward step by playing at the @entity49 @entity3
