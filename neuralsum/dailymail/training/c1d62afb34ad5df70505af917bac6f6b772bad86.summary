by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 07:19 est , 25 september 2013 what do you get when you combine an @entity4 puppet , @entity5 and string theory ? @entity8 student , @entity7 , recently found out in a hilarious video that has gone viral			1
with remarkably smooth harmonies , @entity7 explains the tricky concept of string theory to the tune of @entity14 ’s most famous song			1
right from the start he poses the ultimate questions , ‘ is string theory real ? is it just fantasy ? ’ an @entity4 sock puppet joins the chorus to help explain string theory how string theory could solve one of the biggest mysteries of the universe ; how gravity and quantum physics work fit together			1
in just a couple of days , the @entity32 video racked up more than 270,000 views , and currently has over 1,400,000 views			1
in just a couple of days , the @entity32 video racked up more than 270,000 views , and currently has over 1,400,000 views video : a @entity37 at its most basic level , string theory , also known as the ‘ theory of everything , ’ proposes that all objects in our universe are composed of vibrating filaments ( strings ) and membranes of energy			1
the theory suggests that each so - called fundamental particle contains a tiny , vibrating , one - dimensional loop of string			0
the vibration of the string determines the charge and mass of the greater particle			0
string theory works in ten or eleven dimensions and we only experience four			0
scientists have theorised that the missing dimensions are curled up into a compact space			0
if the space is tiny , on the scale of the strings , then we would be unable to detect them			0
or as , @entity7 put its , ‘ to get down to 4d we compactify			2
oh , @entity68 ! manifolds must be @entity68 ! if we wan na preserve , any of our super-symmetry			0
’ scientists are hopeful that string theory will solve one of the biggest mysteries of the universe ; how gravity and quantum physics work fit together			0
23 - year - old @entity7 has completed his master 's degree at @entity8 in @entity80 , @entity81 with a thesis titled ‘ a new quantisation condition for parity - violating three - dimensional gravity			1
’ he recently told his @entity85 followed that he was putting his studies on hold for a while to focus on his music career			0
‘ i 've been in school all my life so i 'm switching gears and being a musician this year ! ’ he said			2
‘ @entity18 ’ is n’t @entity7 ’ first foray into music			1
last year , the fresh - faced student recorded ‘ @entity97 in the @entity98 , ’ a scientific riff on @entity101 ’s song			1
according to @entity7 ’ @entity103 page , these ‘ science - parody creations are 100 per cent originally recorded and made out of unaltered sounds from his mouth , throat and vocal cords			2
’ the video became popular at @entity111 , the @entity113 research facility where the @entity98 particle - which underpins the accepted standard model of the universe - was found			2
at the time , @entity7 told @entity117 : ' i 'm kind of amazed by the feedback			0
‘ one student from @entity121 told me his supervisor called my video : " the only good thing to come out of the @entity98 discovery so far "			1
' at its most basic level , string theory , also known as the ' theory of everything , ' proposes that all objects in our universe are composed of vibrating filaments ( strings ) and membranes of energy			0

@entity7 created the video with the help of an @entity4 sock puppet
it instantly went viral and currently has over 1,400,000 views on @entity32
the video follows a one by @entity7 last year called ‘ @entity97 in the @entity98 , ’ a scientific riff on @entity101 ’s song ' @entity148 '
