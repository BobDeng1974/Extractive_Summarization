your wedding is fast approaching and , as a last hurrah , you decide to celebrate in the most extravagant way possible - with a trip to ‘ @entity4 '			0
here even a ' poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero - g roulette tables '			0
that ’s the fantastic future imagined by one artist , whose awe - inspiring drawings of a next - generation space station in orbit reveal what space travel may one day look like			1
taking one of several imaginative space planes , in this future timeline you ’ll be partying to your heart ’s content in an orbital extravaganza			1
concept artist @entity21 from @entity22 has created beautiful pictures of what space travel might look like			1
he imagines a space station of tomorrow similar to @entity27 ( shown in image ) , with neon lights and plenty of attractions the images were created by concept artist @entity21 , 32 , from @entity22 in the @entity33 , who normally works on video games and movies			1
but for these drawings he decided to try his hand at imagining what the future of space travel might look like			2
a space settlement would be a large structure , comparable in size to a town or small city , built in @entity47 orbit			2
it would have similar amenities and services to towns and cities on @entity47 , and would enable people to live in space			2
the @entity55 currently houses six astronauts at a time , but a space settlement would have hundreds or thousands of people on board			0
future space settlements may also have artificial gravity by rotating around an axis			2
‘ it ’s inspired by super yachts docking at the casino marinas in @entity68 , as well as @entity69 and of course @entity27 , ’ he told @entity65			2
‘ i liked the kind of trashy , flashy future in movies like @entity74			0
‘ they ’re absolutely preposterous but also cheerful and dynamic and irreverent			2
’ in the main image of @entity4 , a fantastic array of colours and attractiosn can be seen , including a @entity80 and a lit - up cowboy			0
several spacecraft docked at the space station can also be seen , based on similar designs for space planes			1
it is located in orbit around @entity47 , allowing planes to seemingly take off from @entity47 and then return to the planet with relative ease			0
the cone - shaped space station is also shown in a state of partial completion , with space planes again making the journey from the ground			1

the cylindrical design would allow the space station to rotate and provides its inhabitants with artificial gravity and mr @entity21 has also given his take on how humans might get into orbit in the future on a variety of space planes			1
these are commonly known as single - stage - to - orbit ( @entity123 ) vehicles , as they could take off from a runway and land back on @entity47 without having to use an expendable rocket - like the @entity129 had to			0
his designs incorporate efforts from @entity132 , the @entity133 and @entity134			0
and such imaginings are n’t that far - fetched ; @entity136 recently tested its unmanned @entity138 ( @entity138 ) spacecraft			0

‘ i tend to think space stations are usually depicted in a rather austere way , like in the amazing sequences in @entity158 , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t like to second guess @entity160 , he is one of my favourite artists and a genius , but i imagine maybe space cities to be like our cities here on @entity47 ; cluttered , crowded , busy , a little dysfunctional			0
‘ i think to an extent we like our cities that way			0
@entity170 but also full of smaller , human details and regional variation			0
’ he adds that these images are n’t meant to be taken as a wholly serious look at the future of space travel , but rather ‘ a light - hearted imagining of the future where even a poor space miner can maybe strike it lucky at the zero - g roulette tables ! ’ mr @entity21 says his designs are a little different than others that have been devised , such as in 2001 : a @entity158 ( image from the movie shown )			1

concept artist @entity21 from @entity22 has created beautiful pictures of what space travel might look like
he imagines a space station of tomorrow similar to @entity27 , with neon lights and plenty of attractions
he said his designs are intended to be a bit more ' preposterous and cheerful ' than others
and he also *explores* what the space planes that take humans to orbit in future might look like
