@entity2 ceo @entity1 once tried to offer @entity3 his liver in a desperate bid to prolong his life , but his predecessor refused , a new book reveals			1
@entity3 had been suffering serious health problems as a result of his pancreatic cancer and by january 2009 - two years before his death - was in urgent need of a liver transplant			1
on learning this , @entity1 was so upset he took it upon himself to have his blood tested and found that he happened to have the same rare blood type as his good friend and mentor			1
here they are pictured together during a product question and answer session in becoming @entity3 , a new biography by technology reporter @entity29 and @entity31 executive editor @entity30 , it 's revealed that @entity1 discovered it was possible to transplant a portion of someone 's liver to a recipient			1
because it is a regenerative organ , the transplanted portion will grow to a functioning size , while the donor 's liver would also repair			2
bouyed by the findings , @entity1 visited @entity3 at his home in @entity43 to relay the good news			1
' he cut me off at the legs , almost before the words were out of my mouth , ' said @entity1 in the biography , according to @entity31			2
' " no , " he said			0
" i 'll never let you do that			0
i 'll never do that "			0
somebody that 's selfish does n’t reply like that			0
' i mean , here ’s a guy , he ’s dying , he ’s very close to death because of his liver issue and here ’s someone healthy offering a way out			2
' @entity1 insisted that he was ' perfectly healthy ' and stressed that the procedure would not put him at risk			0
but @entity3 ' popped up in bed ' and told him : ' no , i 'm not doing that			0
' @entity1 said @entity3 had very rarely ever shouted at him during the 13 years they had known each other , but ' this was one of them			1
' even though he was gravely ill , the tech guru worked on @entity2 on the last very last day of his life , phoning colleagues from the confines of his bed with new ideas			2
he died at his home on october 5 , 2011 , at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer			1
the most commonly understood type of liver transplant involves the removal of a diseased liver to be replaced with a healthy liver taken from a deceased donor			1
however , another type of transplant has emerged in recent decades with developments in technology and medical techniques - the ' living donor liver transplantation			2
' this involves removing between 50 - 70per cent of the healthy liver from a living donor which is then transplanted into the recipient			0
because of the liver 's regenerative qualities , both the donor and the recipient can live with minimal complications and can regrow fully functioning livers based on the pieces they share			0
while there are side effects for donors , such as blood clots , these are relatively easy to deal with			0
death for donors is extremely low , although it is a risk they must accept prior to surgery			0
the new biography ( pictured right ) about @entity3 ( left ) is due to be released later this month			1

new biography claims the @entity2 boss tried to save his predecessor 's life
@entity3 had been suffering serious health problems due to pancreatic cancer
two years before his death he was in urgent need of a liver transplant
@entity1 , then @entity2 's @entity129 , realized he happened to have the right blood type
but when he offered to transplant a portion of his liver , @entity3 *flatly* refused
