nearly 7,000 properties in @entity1 and @entity2 will be allowed to fall into the sea this century , it was revealed today			1
the homes and buildings - worth more than £ 1billion combined - are expected to be victims of coastal erosion because that is much cheaper than protecting them , according to experts			1
more than 800 of these properties will go in the next 20 years , and homeowners living in them now face the prospect of being forced to move to a safer area with no compensation scheme in place			1
and three local authority areas are forecast to lose more than 250 properties each when looking a century ahead - these being @entity44 ( 293 ) , @entity45 ( 280 ) and @entity40 ( 273 )			1
severe storms in december 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of @entity1 - and at @entity23 in @entity24 , cliff erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea			1
coastal community campaigners claim that the government should do more to help residents living in vulnerable areas move elsewhere , if it can not defend their properties			2
professor @entity53 , a coastal erosion expert at @entity55 , told the @entity38 : ‘ it is a very difficult issue , but we ca n’t defend everything at all costs			0
mapped out : the @entity36 figures presume that funding is maintained for ' shoreline management plans ' , which include four policies to either ' advance the line ' , ' hold the line ' , ' managed retreat ' and ' no active intervention ' on the edge : houses on the east coast close to @entity71 in @entity72 , pictured in 2007			0
nearly 7,000 properties in @entity1 and @entity2 will be allowed to fall into the sea this century , it was revealed today ‘ there are just not the resources to do it and keep on doing it			1
but it is not just about money , often people have lived in places for generations and there is a lot of history and memories			0
’ the figures from the @entity36 presume that funding is maintained for what are known as ' shoreline management plans ' , which include four policies to either ' advance the line ' , ' hold the line ' , ' managed retreat ' and ' no active intervention ' there would be more than 74,000 properties lost in the next century without this intervention			1
current guidance from the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) says more than 200 homes are at risk of being lost to coastal erosion in the next 20 years			1
but the @entity36 analysis puts this at 295 , or 430 in the case of very extreme weather			0
last year ’s tidal surge which hit the east coast was described as the ‘ most serious ’ for 60 years			2
thousands of people were forced to flee their homes as tides in the @entity113 reached higher levels than the 1953 floods , and two people died - in @entity117 and @entity118			1
falling value : this three - bedroom bungalow with views over the @entity113 in @entity122 , @entity24 , was bought for £ 20,000 in 1987 - and the @entity123 reported in 2008 how it was worth £ 1			2
the owners left in 2011 over and out : a house about to fall into the sea at @entity128 near @entity129 as part of the ' @entity132 ' cliffs , pictured in january of this year			0
it was demolished in march , as reported by @entity134 here an @entity36 spokesman told @entity134 ‘ the recent announcement of £ 2.3bn of investment over the next six years will see significant investment in coastal flood and erosion @entity140 , with 15,000 properties better protected from coastal erosion over the next six years			2
‘ the @entity36 uses a range of advanced techniques to monitor and assess the causes and impacts of coastal erosion			0
‘ we work with local authorities , which lead on shoreline management plans , to identify erosion risk management schemes , coastal erosion monitoring and further research on how we best adapt to these changes			0
’ and a @entity100 spokesman told @entity134 : ‘ we are spending more than £ 3.2billion over the course of this parliament on flood management and protection from coastal erosion - half a billion more than in the previous parliament			0
‘ our first ever long - term investment strategy for flood defences will see a further 15,000 houses better protected from coastal erosion by the end of the decade			0
‘ local authorities are best placed to manage the risks to their coastline and government help is available to assist with the costs associated with the loss of a home to erosion			0

it *'s* cheaper to allow properties to be lost to the sea than protect them
more than 800 properties will go in next 20 years , and 7,000 in 100 years
homeowners living there now face the prospect of being forced to leave
most at - risk area in next 20 years is @entity40 , with 76 homes to be lost
@entity44 and @entity45 to lose 250 *+* homes in next 100 years
