the hotly anticipated @entity8 menswear show took place in @entity10 this afternoon and it did n't disappoint			0
@entity11 showed us exactly how men should be dressing this season with silk scarves , shearling jackets and muted tones perfectly capturing the romantic elegance of @entity20 craftwork			1
in a nod to the luxury label 's @entity20 heritage , many of the pieces were emblazoned with iconic @entity4 imagery , such as the skyline and maps of city streets			1
everything is going oversized : there were geometric blanket scarves and a relaxed slouchy aesthetic to some of the outerwear cosy : @entity11 confirmed that the teddy bear coat is hot property for @entity64 and it seems the bigger the better when it comes to accessories many pieces were produced using @entity20 tie looms and the traditional horse blanket jacquard was woven in @entity70 , a place close to @entity11 's heart			2
we 've seen plenty of them on the catwalks this season and @entity11 confirmed that the teddy bear coat is hot property for @entity64			2
there were also gorgeous , chunky knits in rich navy 's and dark emerald greens , geometric blanket scarves , and a very relaxed slouchy aesthetic to some of the outerwear			0
less successful were the mesh tops			0
' string vests aside , # @entity87 # @entity8 is one of my faves , i love the arts & craft movement influences in the prints and the blanket bags , ' mused one audience member			2
the show comes hot on the heels of the brand 's unveiling of its @entity102 campaign starring a young @entity20 cast made up of the likes of actor @entity105 , musician @entity106 and model @entity107			0
under the creative direction of @entity11 , the campaign , which was shot by fashion favourite @entity112 , reflects the gentle and romantic feel of the @entity116 collection			0
taking note ? @entity118 , @entity34 , @entity119 , @entity35 and @entity120 occupied the star - studded front row dare to wear : the string vest tops were less successful and did n't go down too well with the @entity123 heritage : many pieces were produced using @entity20 tie looms and the traditional horse blanket jacquard was woven in @entity70 , a place close to @entity11 's heart ( far right ) famous faces : @entity35 , who has been the poster boy for @entity130 : men , was joined by @entity34 and model @entity132 on the front row fashion fans : @entity136 , @entity37 and model @entity36 , who is a close friend of the brand , also made an appearance			1
