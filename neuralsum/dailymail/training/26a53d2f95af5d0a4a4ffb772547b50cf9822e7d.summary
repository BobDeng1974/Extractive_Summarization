@entity1 ’s inspiration , of a sort , hid in the trees at the sun - kissed @entity5 circuit on friday			1
at the apex of the @entity8 , the acute right - hander at the end of the first sector , lies the resting place of the man regarded as the greatest motor racing driver produced in @entity15 — a double world champion cut down in the prime of his life			0
a simple memorial , encroached upon by weeds , shrouded by firs and white flowers , marks the spot at which @entity24 — or @entity25 as @entity1 recently referred to him — crashed and died during a @entity27 race in april 1968			2
the fear of death stalked the paddock in @entity24 ’s day			0
a few years later another great @entity15 champion , @entity58 , said that although people would deny it forever , they came to see someone get killed			0
up on the screens here at @entity5 they played out old rivalries , @entity66 and @entity67 among them			0
oh , they were less sanitised days			0
here the two protagonists for the world championship , @entity1 and @entity28 , were more keen to play on their friendship than play up their animosity			1
the two @entity44 men arrived for saturday ’s @entity40 @entity39 in the @entity75 woods with the comments @entity1 made about @entity28 being less than a genuine @entity77 providing the background			1
@entity1 half - joked that his old mucker was really a @entity80			1
he lives in @entity81 ( as does @entity1 ) and grew up there			1
his father , the 1982 world champion @entity83 , is @entity84			1
his mother , @entity85 , is @entity40			2
@entity86 : @entity1 trails @entity28 by four points at the top of the drivers ' standings going into @entity40 but @entity28 , who leads @entity1 at the top of the drivers ’ standings by four points , said : ‘ i really do n’t get into such things			1
everybody ’s free to have his opinions			2
i was there and it was more or less a joke , so for me it ’s not relevant			2
i have two home races			1
’ this is @entity28 all over : focused , unwilling to countenance distractions			2
the rivalry may have blown up this season at @entity81 , when @entity28 ’s diversion off the road brought about a yellow flag that blocked @entity1 ’s quest for pole			1
the @entity110 thought it deliberate ; the @entity40 said not			2
but cordiality has broken out ( even if @entity1 was not among the small group of family and friends at @entity28 ’s wedding to @entity117 last week — in @entity81 )			1
the corporate blanket has doused the fire			0
that may be something to do with the predicted attendance of 50,000 for race day , 25,000 short of capacity			0
‘ we have to analyse the phenomenon , ’ admitted @entity44 ’s commercial boss @entity125			0
the other reason for the poor crowd is that home favourite @entity129 is sadly on his back in a @entity133 hospital rather than out here racing			0
@entity28 was fastest in friday ’s first practice session ; @entity1 fastest in the second			1
@entity137 also seem to have narrowed the gap to @entity44			0
the consensus is that @entity1 ’s win at @entity141 a fortnight ago has given him extra belief , even if he won by default after @entity28 broke down			1
the other news here was that @entity146 , 32 - year - old wife of @entity147 , completed her second and final practice session for @entity149			0
she managed to get herself an £ 800 fine for speeding in the pit lane			0
apart from that it was a respectable showing but , given her age , she probably wo n’t take part in a race weekend again .			0

@entity1 trails @entity28 at top of drivers ' standings by four points going into @entity40 @entity39
@entity1 made comments about his @entity44 team - mate @entity28
@entity1 half - joked about *nationality* of @entity28 , who lives in @entity81 , has a @entity84 father and a @entity40 mother
@entity28 : ' everybody **'s** free to have his opinions . i was there and it was more or less a joke , so for me it **'s** not relevant . i have two home races '
