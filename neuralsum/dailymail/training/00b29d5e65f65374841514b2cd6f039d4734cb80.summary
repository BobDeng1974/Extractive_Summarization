following a relatively lukewarm reception to its latest handsets , and reports that the larger @entity4 bends when stored in a back pocket , @entity3 has now been forced to pull its latest software update			1
users began reporting overnight that the upgrade to @entity9 robbed them of signal , data service and the @entity13 capability			1
this is the second major issue to arise with @entity3 's newest iphone since it was launched on friday - making it the most troubled new product release since the @entity15 and ' antennagate			1
the glitch appears to affect only the newest iphones - not @entity33 or @entity34 , or older models			0
@entity3 users on networks across the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 were reporting problems via @entity43 and official support forums after updating their operating systems , @entity36 reported			1
@entity3 ’s @entity9 was designed to fix a number of glitches with the @entity49 software			1
these included a bug that meant the release of @entity54 apps were delayed , an issue with third - party keyboards , a bug that stopped some apps accessing the photo library , reliability and usability of @entity3 's @entity63 feature , an issue where ringtones were not being restored following @entity67 backups , and a problem that could cause ‘ unexpected cellular data usage when receiving @entity72 / @entity71 messages			1
’ for many , the update solved many of these issues , but in exchange , caused the @entity13 fingerprint scanner to fail , as well as create the loss of data services on networks across the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
the bug appears to only be affecting the newest iphones			0

@entity106 to install @entity20 8 on your @entity15			2

@entity3 has refused to comment on the issue this weekend , some @entity15 6 plus users reported that their devices bent after just a few hours in their pockets			1
@entity3 has declined to comment on this particular issue			2
this is not the first time @entity3 's phones have been dogged by faults			2
shortly after the @entity15 launched in 2012 , customers struggled to get signal when the phone was held on the lower left edge of the frame			1
@entity3 issued a statement advising customers should ' avoid gripping [ the phone ] in the lower left corner ' when making or receiving a call , which was met with even more complaints			1
the firm later released a software update to fix the problem , as well as offering customers free cases that @entity177 said at the time would also solve the issue			1
a small number of owners even sued the firm , and received $ 15 ( £ 9 ) settlement checks			0
the @entity184 was then dogged with battery problems , and some users reported issues with a yellow tint on the display			2
it is believed the thinner model , in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design , causes the phone to deform			0

it has already achieved more than 18.5 million views			0
