ever wondered what an active volcano actually looks like up close ? well , now you can see for yourself - without ever having to go dangerously near a lake of erupting lava			2
explorers @entity5 and @entity7 rappelled into the crater of @entity9 on @entity10 , @entity11 , getting as close as humanly possible a violently active volcano - and filming it on a @entity14 camera for all to see			1
' it is one of only five places in the world with persistent lava lakes , ' @entity7 wrote online afterwards			2
' getting to it was kind of like a reverse climbing of @entity40			1
' ' the volcano fought back at us , and we had to deal with terrible weather , tremendous heat from the lava , descending and ascending 400 meters of near vertical , loose rock face , acid rain so strong that it could have come from a car battery , and a variety of other craziness			0
' the two men used a @entity14 camera to get this incredible footage - though the heat melted part of the camera the @entity9 on @entity10 is one of only 5 places in the world with persistent lava lakes say cheese ! @entity7 posed for a photo in his heat suit in front of the boiling fire although the men were splashed by small chunks of lava , which melted a hole in @entity7 's rain jacket , they managed to get in and out unscathed			1
their camera on the other hand was n't so lucky			0
' the lava melted part of one of my cameras , ' @entity7 continued			0
' and my protective heat suit is now ruined from the intense acid rain			0

explorers repelled 1200 foot crater of @entity9 in @entity11
on a @entity14 camera , they filmed violent lava eruptions from within volcano
' it was kind of like a reverse climbing of @entity40 , ' the men wrote afterward
