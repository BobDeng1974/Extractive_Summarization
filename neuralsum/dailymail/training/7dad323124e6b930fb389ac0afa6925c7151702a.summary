@entity63 , @entity17 chief executive , said he was approached by @entity64 for a playhouse for @entity16 , but when he arrived he realised there was other work needed			1
he said : ' we were approached by @entity61			0
we have put out play areas for the children - it 's one of the things we do and @entity61 saw that and thought it would be a nice thing for @entity16 , and when i went and visited there were other bits and pieces that i thought needed doing			1
' the playroom was a bit of a mess , it needed decorating			0
so with @entity16 's birthday coming up we thought we 'd get it done in time for his birthday celebrations			2
' the renovation team then spent three 12 - hour days to get the job done as quick as possible , in time for @entity16 's fourth birthday on september 1			1
' the guys said she was thrilled			0
it 's the reaction on your children 's face that usually makes the biggest impact , and i know @entity16 was running around between his room and his playhouse			2
' for a lot of people , it takes a huge amount for a family to come forward and ask , and when you get out to a families home - we found this in @entity61 's case - she did n't want anything done for herself , she wanted the playhouse			1
the charity did the same for his widow @entity115			0
pictured is the playhouse and trampoline installed for their son forces support recently received a heartfelt thank you note from @entity115			2
although she made the first inquires about he possibility of having a playhouse made for her and @entity1 's son @entity16 , when @entity17 arrived they realised the home could do with a few extra fixes			1
eventually this ended with a makeover of their son 's indoor playroom and fixes to a few damaged parts of the home itself			2
her note read : ' i honestly can not thank you and your team enough for what you 've all done for us			0
the playroom is fantastic , and i 'm sure @entity16 will spend many hours having fun in there			0
' he 's got a lovely playhouse in the garden now and an area he can enjoy outside			2
' i do n't feel like thank you is enough for what you 've done , we now have a home we can enjoy and be proud of			0
' drummer @entity1 with his son @entity16 , who was two years old when his father was killed in @entity158 , @entity159 ' but the trampoline was set in boggy ground and the playroom walls were sort of damaged and i saw a few problems with the hall			1
' people are quite shy of coming forward , so @entity61 had initially said : " we 've seen your playhouses , @entity16 would love one of those , is it possible ? " ' families are usually consumed with grief and little bits and pieces around the home do n't seem so relevant as they would on a normal day			0
' mr @entity1 was on a @entity159 high street when he was attacked and butchered by crazed @entity178 fanatics wielding cleavers and knives			0
in broad daylight , the 25 - year - old drummer was run over then hacked to death in front of horrified onlookers			1
during : a tv crew films as the group carries out his mother 's garden makeover the team work on the playhouse they constructed for @entity1 's son , @entity16 , at his grandmother 's home pavers were also laid down to replace grass and bushes , helping reduce the garden 's maintenance workload his mother @entity201 told @entity202 her garden had become too much work to manage during the turbulent events following his murder			1
she said : ' it was my safety zone away from everybody , somewhere i could iust have a think , have a cry			0
' but it just got too overgrown we never had time to get on top of it			0
i felt like my safety net was gone			0
' the couple had been planning to renovate the back yard but this was put on hold when their son was killed and during the subsequent trial of @entity224 and @entity225			0
