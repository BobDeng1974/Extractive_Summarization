@entity0 faces a new corruption inquiry after a burglar ‘ admitted ’ carrying out 500 break - ins			0
four officers are under investigation amid fears the offender may have been encouraged to confess to crimes he did not commit , to help improve clear - up rates			1
last night the force suspended a system whereby crimes are ‘ taken into consideration ’ over concerns of widespread abuse			1
it also stripped from its system the 500 ‘ @entity17 ’ , a tacit admission the man ’s confession was not credible			2
probe : @entity0 faces a new corruption inquiry after a burglar ' admitted ' carrying out 500 break - ins the announcement of an investigation by the @entity26 ’s corruption unit is the latest blow to embattled commissioner sir @entity28			2
this week he was criticised by mps for failing to get a grip on historic corruption allegations linked to the @entity33 investigation and the mass shredding of documents			2
the @entity29 is already under scrutiny over crime recording methods after a whistleblower revealed widespread fiddling of the figures			1
last night , @entity41 , chairman of the @entity43 home affairs select committee , which has been investigating crime recording practices said : ‘ it is a concern that some crimes may have been written off as having been dealt with by those who have no responsibility for their commission			2
’ concerns : @entity41 , chairman of the @entity43 home affairs select committee @entity29 have also raised questions about whether the @entity29 is giving sufficient priority and resources to investigating internal corruption			1
there are only 36 staff probing disturbing allegations that @entity29 police officers stole and trafficked in drugs , took bribes and sold confidential intelligence to criminals			1
by contrast the @entity0 has 88 staff working on phone hacking by the media and 17 on allegations of computer hacking by journalists – a total of 105 – at a cost so far of £ 19.4million			0
a further 40 staff are investigating the historic allegations of sexual abuse by the dead dj @entity78 and others at a cost of £ 3.75million			0
@entity0 said the case of the 500 burlgaries taken into account emerged as part of a review ordered after concerns over ‘ integrity ’ in a routine sampling of cases			0
the @entity29 said the investigation covers almost all of south - east @entity92 , from @entity93 to @entity94 and @entity95 to @entity96			1
three detective constables and a sergeant are under investigation but have not been suspended			2
it is understood that , after admitting the offences , which span a nine - year period from 2004 to last year , the suspect , who has not been named , withdrew his confession			0
under the ‘ taken into consideration ’ system , criminals can admit offences which do not form part of the main charge they face in court			1
as a result they can never be prosecuted for them , but they will not face a longer punishment as a result of admitting them			0
crucially , the crimes count as solved for the purpose of clear - up rates			0
police say the system gives closure to victims , and allows offenders to ‘ wipe their slate clean ’ and move on			0
but critics say it is ripe for abuse and any admissions should result in a tougher punishment			0
explosive details of police corruption contained in files shredded by @entity0 could have been preserved by a second secret investigation into rogue officers , it has emerged			1
the @entity29 has admitted that it destroyed a number of documents relating to @entity141 – a multi-million pound inquiry examining criminal behaviour by its officers – more than a decade ago			1
but the force later launched another anti-corruption probe , codenamed @entity147 , which lasted for nine years and uncovered a network of rogue police who were working with organised criminals			0
a leaked police anti-corruption report from 2002 refers to @entity147 , stating : ‘ @entity147 is a long - term intelligence operation to assess the threat that organised criminals and their associations with serving and retired police officers pose to the @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
‘ these subjects have been undermining the mps with virtual immunity for the last ten years and were identified during the course of two previous intelligence - gathering operations , “ @entity141 ” and “ @entity162 ”			0
’ the revelation raised hopes that some of the @entity141 material , described by a former head of the @entity29 ’s anti-corruption branch as ‘ gold - dust stuff ’ , may have been saved			1
if found , it could shed light on concerns that corrupt officers undermined botched investigations into the murders of the black teenager @entity33 and private eye @entity177 .			0

four @entity29 officers are currently under investigation
offender may have been encouraged to confess to crimes he did not commit
force suspends system whereby crimes are ' taken into consideration '
