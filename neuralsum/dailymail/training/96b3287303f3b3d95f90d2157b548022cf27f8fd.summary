@entity0 has told @entity1 the title race remains on as he targets a fourth @entity5 winners ' medal and a first with @entity6			1
@entity0 , @entity1 's record goalscorer , scored the equaliser in september 's clash with the @entity9 but was unable to force a winner in the return fixture as @entity13 's men survived a @entity6 siege to draw 1 - 1 on saturday			1
@entity0 applauds both sets of fans during the game between @entity1 and @entity6 the 36 - year - old midfielder scored a club record 211 goals in 13 years at @entity1 and won three @entity5 titles , but could be a key figure in @entity6 's title defence after leaving @entity24 last may			1
the draw meant @entity6 remain five points behind @entity1 with 15 games to go			1
" you lose and it 's eight points difference and the league will become a bit more clear , " @entity0 told mcfc.com			1
" now it 's very much lots of points to play for and it 's on			2
it 's important to keep focused			0
" the draw keeps the league bubbling			2
@entity1 are obviously the favourites as they 're five points ahead			1
@entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 celebrate the @entity43 's opener against @entity1 at @entity24 " it does n't change anything and @entity1 will be happy with that but we ca n't be too upset			1
" @entity0 joined @entity6 ahead of a move to @entity49 , having previously said he would never play for another @entity5 club			1
he might have expected a muted reception from @entity9 supporters , but , bar the odd dissenting voice , he was well received from fans who held him so dear for so long			0
@entity1 stopper @entity55 makes a save to deny @entity6 a goal " i was excited but also a bit nervous to come back here , " said @entity0 , who came on as a substitute 13 minutes from time			1
" but i enjoyed it			0
i have to give my best when i come on the pitch and i was delighted with my reception			0
" @entity6 fans have been brilliant since i 've been here			1
@entity1 fans show their love for former midfielder @entity0 upon his return to west @entity67 " they might not have known what to expect from me when i came here			1
would i come here and just jolly up for five months and then go away to @entity69 ? " they can see when i play i try to give everything and then i came back here after 13 years and got a great reception at the end			0
" when you play for a long time it is nice to have that rapport and i 'm lucky to have two sets of fans that were very good			0
" i 'm pleased for that moment because i did n't get it at the end of last year			0
i 'm very thankful for that			0
" but not all @entity1 fans were pleased with the former midfielders return to @entity24 @entity6 captain @entity86 has no doubts his side can overcome the deficit , with 45 points to play for			1
@entity86 said : " that 's probably the hardest away game we 'll have this season			0
it gives us enough confidence to carry on and push for the league			2
" five points is not too much			0
experience tells us that five points is nothing so for us it 's time to start a good run again and to put everything behind and play at the level that we can again			0
" @entity1 took the lead four minutes before half - time through @entity106 , only to see @entity40 swiftly equalise			2
@entity106 was deputising for @entity107 after the @entity110 - born @entity109 striker was suspended for treading on @entity111 as @entity1 advanced to the @entity113 final at @entity115 's expense			2
@entity116 ( left ) and @entity107 were forced to miss the draw with @entity6 @entity106 replaced the suspended @entity107 and found the back of the net for @entity121 's side @entity107 will miss the matches with @entity123 and @entity124 , too , and @entity106 has been backed to fill the void created by the absence of @entity1 's top scorer			1
midfielder @entity128 told @entity129 : " @entity106 did a good job			0
he scored a goal and did exactly what the coach wanted from him			0
" he gives us more confidence now for the next game			0
i 'm very excited for the next game , how he 's going to play			0
@entity86 leaps highest following a @entity1 corner as @entity139 attempts the flick on " now people will see he 's a very good player and he 's going to be very important for us			2
" the @entity9 , who were also without @entity116 ( hamstring ) and @entity145 ( calf ) , could also be boosted by the imminent arrival of @entity148 from @entity149			0
the @entity151 forward was at @entity24 on saturday in a transfer which is likely to be financed by the sale of @entity154 to @entity155 , with @entity156 also moving on			1
meanwhile , @entity13 again opted out of media duties and could face a fine from the @entity5			2
@entity13 gestures towards the referee as @entity1 are held by the current @entity5 champions			1

@entity0 is targeting a fourth title win with @entity6
@entity0 made an emotional return to @entity24 on saturday
midfielder has already won the league three times with former club @entity1
