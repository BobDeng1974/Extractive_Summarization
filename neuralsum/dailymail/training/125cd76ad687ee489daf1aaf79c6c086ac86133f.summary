by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 11:14 est , 20 september 2012 a brave and frail - looking @entity1 has released a video from her hospital bed as she prepares to undergo a bone marrow transplant today			1
the @entity6 anchor , 51 , who was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome , or @entity8 , earlier this year - a disease which attacks blood cells and bone - has spent the past 11 days at @entity12 preparing for the procedure , undergoing eight days of intensive chemotherapy			1
the treatment appears to have taken its toll and ms @entity17 had clearly lost a significant amount of weight as she addressed the camera			1
staying strong : @entity6 anchor @entity1 looked frail as she addressed fans in a video update from her hospital bed			1
today she will undergo her bone marrow transplant cast of support : ms @entity1 gets a visit from @entity6 co-worker @entity27 , who wore a mask to protect her from germs from the outside world wearing a pink baseball cap and navy top and pants , clutching a cold drink , she said in the video on her @entity6 blog : ' this journey is as much about the mind as it is the body			1
you 've got to change the way you think in order to change the way you feel , ' she continued			2
then , repeating the words , almost as if to remind herself : ' you 've got to change the way you think in order to change the way you feel			2
' she also thanked fans for their love and support , adding : ' and let me just say this lastly , i feel the love and i thank you for it			2
' positive thinking : wearing a pink baseball cap and navy top and pants , clutching a cold drink , ms @entity1 said : ' this journey is as much about the mind as it is the body ' @entity1 's room : in another clip , she showed off her ' disco pole ' , which had been dressed with tinsel ms @entity1 , her doctors and her ' @entity73 ' have been keeping fans up - to - date on her progress and today , her oncologist , dr @entity71 , joined @entity76 on @entity6 to explain her progress so far			1
on form : the tv host pictured on @entity6 in august , before her admission to hospital explaining the difference between the therapy that ms @entity1 was having over the summer , compared with the the last week , dr @entity71 said : ' we could see in watching @entity1 over the summer that she looked fantastic , she was having an easy time with it			1
' that was really @entity8 - directed treatment			2
that was to mow the lawn , get rid of as many @entity8 cells as possible , boost the bone marrow and get ready for the transplant			2
' for the past eight days , though , ms @entity1 has been having two - and - a - half hour chemotherapy every six hours , followed by a staggering continuous 18 hours on tuesday			1
' this type of therapy over the last week has been much more intensive , ' dr @entity71 said			1
' this is n't just mowing the lawn and not getting rids of the weeds on top , it 's digging down deeper and really trying to empty out the bone marrow cells and get rid of the immune system cells so that the new ones from @entity108 can come on in			2
' unsurprisingly , the aggressive treatment , which has wiped out the television presenter 's entire immune system , has left her feeling wiped - out			2
dr @entity71 continued : ' [ @entity1 is ] a powerhouse but she feels crummy			2
she 's got a headache that wo n't quit			2
it 's hard to get up and even move around in the room			0
' this is someone who 's used to 50 hours a day and an athlete with tremendous stamina			0
it 's powerful to hear her say that reading a few emails or sitting up in bed is a lot of work			0
' wiped out : for the past eight days , ms @entity1 has been having two - and - a - half hour chemotherapy every six hours , followed by a staggering continuous 18 hours on tuesday the next few months will mark the ' rebuilding phase ' , dr @entity71 explained			1
' @entity132 is not immediate			0
it takes weeks to months â€¦ @entity108 's cells will be trying to set up shop to set up an immune system and marrow to fight off infection			0
' ms @entity1 wrote a touching message on her blog on tuesday to let people know that she 's staying positive			0
' last sunday to lift my spirits i threw a little party at my apartment for my @entity6 family , ' she wrote			1
' the next morning i walked through the hospital doors , with my guardian angels - mom & dad - back together and blazing a trail ahead of me			1
' she also described how her body was responding to the daily doses of chemotherapy			1
' the start of last week went well but the daily chemo / treatment caught up to me by the weekend , ' it read			0
the @entity6 family : ms @entity1 tweeted a photo from her send off , before her admission to hospital			1
she is seen between her co-host @entity163 ( left ) and @entity73 's senior executive producer @entity164 ( right ) ' my body is so weak but not my mind			0
you give me the courage to keep going			0
' ' so today is my last day of chemo ... wednesday is called a day of rest , yay , right ! the transplant is scheduled for thursday morning			0
' myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells			0
it affects about 18,000 people each year - but only several hundred of those are as a result of cancer treatment			0
symptoms can include shortness of breath , weakness or feeling tired , skin that is paler than usual , easy bruising or bleeding and fever or frequent infections			0
the primary approach to treating @entity8 is a bone marrow transplant			0
the more closely matched the donor and recipient are , the more likely the immune system will not reject the new marrow and treatment will be successful			0
the star will undergo the bone marrow transplant to treat a rare blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome or @entity8 - her sister @entity108 is the donor			0
the procedure is expected to last between 30 to 60 minutes , and afterwards ms @entity1 will stay in a room designed to keep the air as clean as possible in order to protect her from any germs or infections , though friends and family will still be welcome to visit			1
the disease has damaged the @entity6 host 's bone marrow , and likely arose as a result of the chemotherapy @entity1 ' underwent in 2007 to successfully treat her breast cancer , according to @entity6 's chief health and medical editor , @entity218			1
ms @entity1 is n't expected to reclaim her seat on @entity6 for several months , to allow her time to recover			1
the tv anchor suffered another emotional blow on august 30 when her beloved mother , @entity223 , passed away at home in @entity225 at the age of 88 - her father , @entity227 , died in 2004			1
' i think she misses her mom a lot and i think it 's been really hard to go through this , ' dr @entity71 revealed			0
' she said yesterday this is the first hard thing that she 's had to go through without her mom			0
so i think that 's been a real challenge but she is a trooper and fighting through it and doing very , very well			0

the @entity6 anchor , 51 , has spent the past 11 days in hospital preparing for the procedure , undergoing eight days of intensive chemotherapy
