like everyone in the boxing world i can not wait to see @entity5 fight @entity3			1
i ’m not sure yet whether i will make the trip – for travelling fans , the tickets will be like gold dust but more expensive			2
i am not part of the promotion and yet i have still had hundreds of calls from people asking for tickets			2
i have heard some interesting rumours on this one			0
some people are saying tickets could trade for as much as £ 100,000 for ringside			1
i have also heard rumours that no tickets will go on general release to the public			2
@entity5 spends his birthday watching the @entity26 basketball team @entity27 plays chess as he takes time out of his training for the @entity5 fight the @entity31 in @entity32 will host the fight and rumours are that ringside seats could cost £ 100,000 the signed contract confirming that @entity5 and @entity3 will fight on may 2 in @entity32 i desperately hope that is not the case			1
boxing needs to stay accessible even though this is an extraordinary fight with an unmatched ability to make money			0
it will generate hundreds of millions whichever way they sell it			0
on the fight itself , i think it will be compelling			0
people will say it should have happened years ago but i still think it is a great match - up			0
the general feeling is that @entity5 will win by a wide unanimous decision			1
i ’m not totally convinced by that			0
@entity5 beat @entity56 in their re-match in september and is undefeated in 47 fights @entity3 beat @entity60 in @entity61 last year and has lost five of his 57 professional fights @entity5 and @entity3 will finally get it on in the ring on may 2 in @entity32 i think @entity5 will win , but it could be close			1
the one thing that @entity5 wo n’t like is @entity3 ’s speed			1
he will put @entity69 under tremendous pressure and in those circumstances anything can happen			0
it might even lead @entity5 to let go of his punches more frequently and perhaps even force a stoppage			1
i can see that happening , though my instinct tells me he will win on points .			0
