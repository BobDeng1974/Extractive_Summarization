@entity0 is to hand over an expected £ 600million more to fight global warming in the @entity2 including cash to build sea and flood defences			2
angry mps said last night that voters would not understand why money is being sent overseas when not enough has been done to shore up flood defences here			1
earlier this year homes and fields in @entity11 were flooded as a result of the wettest winter on record			1
some local people believe the @entity17 ’s decision to stop dredging rivers was also a factor			0
days ago pictures emerged of water rising again on the @entity22			1
the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity11 , flooded 11 months ago and has already risen ( pictured ) the latest handout will be announced by @entity33 on thursday , the day of the @entity34 and @entity35 by - election			1
but many @entity38 mps believe voters are sick of seeing taxpayers ’ money sent abroad to tackle fashionable causes			1
the massive giveaway risks becoming a propaganda gift to @entity45 which is confident of winning the by - election			2
the party has exploited public scepticism about climate change and the value of foreign aid			0
some of the funding will go on flood defences amid fears that climate change will lead to more adverse weather			2
but @entity56 , @entity38 mp for @entity57 , said : ‘ at a time when we in our own country have suffered from flooding and devastation , with potentially more to come , this does n’t send out the right message			1
‘ the overwhelming mood in the country is that the first duty of government is to look after this country			0
it sends a confusing message to people affected by flooding here that we are spending so much on flood defences overseas rather than at home			1
i do n’t think this will help us win the general election			0
’ flooded fields near the village of @entity80 in @entity11 which was completely submerged last winter residents are concerned not enough is being done to prevent flooding again this year in @entity11			1
a car and caravan can be seen in a flooded field in february the donation will be handed to the new @entity88 @entity87 , which is being set up to help developing countries cut their carbon emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change			2
government sources refused to disclose the exact size of the commitment last night , but confirmed it will run into ‘ hundreds of millions of pounds ’			0
the money is likely to be taken from @entity0 ’s £ 11.5billion aid budget , part of which is earmarked for helping countries deal with climate change			1
critics claimed handing more money to foreign flood defences ' did not send out the right message ' one source indicated that @entity0 ’s contribution is unlikely to be less than the amount given by @entity108 and @entity109 who have each pledged $ 1billion ( £ 625 million )			1
the @entity112 will donate $ 3billion			0
mr @entity33 initially appeared to suggest that @entity0 would not contribute to the new fund , saying the @entity0 had ‘ more than played its part ’ in the fight against climate change			2
but , speaking at his closing press conference at the @entity120 summit in @entity121 yesterday , the prime minister confirmed a major donation would be announced this week			0
mr @entity33 insisted the cash was not ‘ new money ’ and attempted to play down the significance of the move			1
the prime minister said : ‘ @entity0 has already set aside a substantial sum for green climate funds , and all we have to do now is decide how much of that already set aside money to put into this specific fund			0
‘ as ever in these things @entity0 will play its part and play a very constant part			0
‘ it ’s been good that some other countries have been encouraged to come forward and put some money there			2
but everyone knows @entity0 will play our part because we ’ve already set aside money , so when we make an announcement it wo n’t be new money			0
’ @entity144 , conservative mp for @entity145 , said voters would not understand why their money was being ‘ wasted ’ in this way			0
‘ we have not got enough money to provide enough firefighters and police officers locally , so to spend £ 600million on what i would say is a wasted project just seems crackers , ’ he said			0
@entity157 , @entity45 ’s energy spokesman , suggested mr @entity33 was engaged in a vanity exercise to maintain his standing among world leaders			2
mr @entity157 said : ‘ @entity33 is preparing to play “ me too ” with hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money			1
money that could be better spent at home			0
