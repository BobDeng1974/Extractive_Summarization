a recent @entity1 news article showcasing a @entity3 artist who makes millions from her invisible works of art has been revealed to be a joke			1
though intended as a satire , the september piece on @entity9 about 27 - year - old @entity10 , who told the site her ' art is about imagination , ' managed to infuriate art world critics who did n't get the joke			1
now the writers and readers who cried ' the emperor has no clothes ' are the ones left with their pants down			0
who 's laughing now ? two prankster @entity1 radio hosts duped a bunch of media types with a hoax story about a @entity3 artist whose ' invisible ' works of art fetch millions of dollars guardian art blogger @entity31 wrote on tuesday that the outrage that grew out of the misunderstood joke because so many are ' shocked and repelled by the art market ' and of ' the image of rich people forking out for invisible art. ' the @entity40 article , which was penned by radio pranksters @entity42 and @entity43 , quoted @entity10 's imaginary art dealer as saying ' her invisible works can fetch upwards of a million dollars			1
' @entity31 points out just a couple of the gullible outlets who had knee - jerk reactions to the piece , including sports website barstool			0
' if you ’re some artsy fartsy idiot paying money for invisible art , you got @entity57 kill yourself , ' they wrote			0
the @entity40 report was shared and liked tens of thousands of times and the comments sections lit up after outlets reported the hoax as fact , with many readers ridiculing the fictional young woman and her nonexistent art. another piece published at @entity40 revealed the pranksters intentions with the joke			2
' in the arts , there is much room for interpretation and we thought it would be interesting to push the idea to the extreme – invisible art , ' said @entity42			0
while the audio piece posted along with the @entity40 article seems to make all but clear that there is n't actually a @entity10 , someone did to the trouble of creating a website and social media accounts for her			1
' just because you ca n’t see anything , does n’t mean i did n’t put hours of work into creating a particular piece , ' @entity10 writes on the site , where titles like ' @entity94 ' and ' @entity95 ' are posted below empty spaces			0
obviously a joke : the fictional artist , 27 - year - old @entity10 , even has a website of her ' works ' where titles like ' @entity102 ' and ' @entity95 ' accompany nothing but empty space			2

a september article by @entity40 showcased an artist named @entity10 who *claimed* her work is ' about imagination '
the article was revealed to be a joke , but not before media across @entity1 *decried* the artist as a shocking fraud
