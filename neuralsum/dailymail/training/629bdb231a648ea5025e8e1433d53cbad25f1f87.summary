what do you first notice about them ? jackets and ties , hair for the most part well - trimmed and almost all shoes respectfully shone			1
were it not for the guitar in the centre it could be any group of young @entity12 male office workers and pretty shorthand typists celebrating a collective pools win			1
but look a little closer			2
is n’t that @entity16 next to @entity17 , letting the side down with their longish hair and louche jumpers in the bottom left - hand corner ; over on the right there ’s fellow @entity26 @entity25 and dandy @entity27			1
where ’s drummer @entity29 ? oh , yes , up there in the back row , as glum as ever			2
and the girl in the leather coat who looks like the boss ’s secretary ? surprise , surprise , it ’s @entity40 — not long out of the typing pool and a star for less than six months			2
above photograph from ' @entity50 : how @entity46 music conquered the sixties , edited by @entity53 ( @entity54 ) then there ’s the young lady with the fringe on the other side of the guitar who seems to be cowering from the attentions of the three youths around her ? it ’s @entity65 , 50 years ago the dizziest , most envied , best - connected girl in @entity46 as the co-presenter of tv ’s @entity48			1
‘ the weekend starts here , ’ the show boasted , but for millions it was the @entity12 that started there on @entity70 , every friday night with its organised chaos of live music , ordinary kids dancing and the sheer essence of being young			1
it was april 1964 , and this photo captured rehearsals for the @entity78 at the @entity79			1
and , with the exception of @entity81 , who four days earlier had overwhelmed @entity83 by having the top five records there , nearly all of the beat boom stars are here , a first crop of what would soon be a golden generation of @entity46 pop stars			1
there ’s @entity93 , still with @entity94 , @entity95			1
most dominant are the @entity97 acts , like @entity40 herself , and all the others from @entity101 ’s @entity100 , the @entity102 , the aptly - named @entity103 and heartthrob @entity104 with his dakotas and the @entity106 , both of whom got @entity109 ’s cast - off songs that were n’t good enough for @entity81			1
and what a conservative - looking crowd of kids they were , or , should we say , gang of boys , because pop then was an overwhelmingly male profession			1
with the exception of @entity40 and @entity65 , the only other non-male is blonde - haired @entity120 , she of the shiny lips and tight dresses , who seems to be in conversation with @entity125 , the show ’s other presenter			1

39 @entity277 , @entity102 guitarist			0
still touring with the band			0
40 @entity279 , drummer with @entity203			2
the @entity280 : ( from left to right ) @entity127 , @entity147 , @entity282 and @entity140 @entity125 was ancient in comparison with the others			0
thirty - five , if he was a day , even older than @entity191 , the only non-white artist , who was already 26			2
the prevailing general image of the @entity12 today is a colourful time of flowing hair entwined with flowers , of bells , beads and flares and regency - styled suits			1
well , perhaps it was by 1967 , but not in 1964			2
the tab collars and tight - across - the - crutch trousers may suggest @entity296 , and the @entity298 boots , with built - up heels in @entity16 ’s case to give him an extra 2in of height , were probably @entity303 , who were the cobblers to the groovy back then			2
but there is n’t a pair of blue jeans in sight			2
showing how rich you were , how anti-establishment and intelligent by donning denim was yet to arrive			0
and now : @entity16 ( left ) pictured in concert in june this year and @entity40 ( right ) , who had a tv biopic earlier this year still going strong : the seemingly indestructible lead guitarist for the @entity26 , @entity17 , pictured performing in may this year @entity65 ( right ) , the breathless young presenter on @entity48 , with her long - term partner , singer @entity244 ( left ) @entity29 ( left ) performing at the @entity317 and @entity94 ( right ) looking slightly different from his @entity12 heydey and at least half the performers here have n’t adopted a trailblazing @entity81 moptop			1
shoulder - length hair on men was years away			2
as for moustaches and beards , they were for old men ( ok , @entity94 has a neatly - trimmed beard , but he was a reconstituted jazzer , and therefore cerebral			1
) the people in this photo might have been going to a charity mod ball , but there is n’t much that was particularly mod or even modish about them			2
casual smart was the style for stepping out in then , whether it was going to work , to the local youth club or to appear on tv			2
these guys probably would n’t have had many more ‘ best ’ clothes anyway , because what we see here , with only one or two exceptions ( yes you , @entity25 ) , is a generation of grown - up war babies			1
thrilled by their good luck , they are young and mainly working class , born in the bomb - threatened early @entity353 and brought up and educated in @entity356 austerity			2
when this photo was taken , they were mainly in their early 20s and just about to be part of an explosion of opportunities to which their talents and the times gave them a kind of life their parents ’ generation could never have imagined			1
no wonder — @entity29 aside — they looked so happy			0
and i bet even he was smiling inside .			0

the group of 40 @entity46 pop stars posed for the photo in april 1964 ahead of the ball at the @entity79
apart from @entity81 - who that week attained the top five records in @entity83 - most the beat boom stars are pictured
golden line - up *includes* @entity17 and the fellow @entity26 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity120
most dominant are the @entity384 , @entity103 and @entity385 and the @entity106
despite prevailing image from @entity12 , none of the stars have long hair , jeans , beards or an *obvious* @entity394 style
stars , mainly in early 20s , were about to be part of explosion of opportunities that their parents ’ generation could never have imagined
