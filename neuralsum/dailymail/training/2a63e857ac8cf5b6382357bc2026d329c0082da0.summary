doctors have warned that our unwavering love of bacon could be sending us to an early grave			1
figures released last week revealed that bacon sales in the @entity7 rose by nearly 10 per cent last year to an all time record of $ 4 billion			1
and research by pork supplier supplier @entity9 found that 65 per cent of @entity7 were behind the idea of making bacon the country 's ' national food '			1
figures released last week revealed that bacon sales in the @entity7 rose by nearly 10 per cent last year to an all time record of $ 4 billion			1
but doctors say unprocessed meat increases the risk of heart disease , cancer and diabetes but medical experts have repeatedly warned of the dangers of eating too much processed meat , as it has been linked to cancer , diabetes and heart disease			1
worse still , the legendary pairing of bacon and maple syrup is even more damaging , @entity31 scientists have warned			1
they say when bacon or sausages are combined with sugar , this makes our craving for the meat worse - a phenomenon known as ' food trifecta '			1
this is defined as the irresistible trio of fat , salt , and sugar , @entity44 reports			0
previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting			2
called the @entity54 reaction , it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated			0
the acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate			0
the legendary pairing of bacon and maple syrup is even more damaging , experts warn			1
they say when bacon or sausages are combined with sugar , this makes our craving for the meat worse - a phenomenon known as ' food trifecta ' another theory is that the meat has a special savoury taste called ' umami '			1
this is the @entity76 word for the fifth basic sense of taste , after bitter , salty , sour and sweet - and is the main reason why we like foods such as cheese , bacon and soy sauce			2
but experts are increasingly concerned about how much processed meat we are all eating			0
researchers from the @entity89 have found that eating processed meat , such as bacon , sausage or processed deli meats , was associated with a 42 per cent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 per cent higher risk of type 2 diabetes			1
previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting			2
called the @entity54 reaction , it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated			0
the acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate			0
@entity111 , of the @entity113 education centre in @entity114 , explained the reaction releases hundreds of smells and flavours , but it is the smell which reels in the eater			0
' if we could n't smell , then taste would n't be the same			0
' but they did not find any higher risk of heart disease or diabetes among individuals eating unprocessed red meat , such as from beef , pork , or lamb			1
researcher @entity129 said : ' when we looked at average nutrients in unprocessed red and processed meats eaten in the @entity7 , we found that they contained similar average amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol			2
' in contrast , processed meats contained , on average , four times more sodium ( salt ) and 50 per cent more nitrate preservatives			2
' this suggests that differences in salt and preservatives , rather than fats , might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats , but not with unprocessed red meats			1
' @entity151 is known to increase blood pressure , a strong risk factor for heart disease			1
in animal experiments , nitrate preservatives can promote hardening of the arteries and reduce glucose tolerance , effects which could increase risk of heart disease and diabetes			1
to lower risk of heart attacks and diabetes , people should consider which types of meats they are eating , she said			1
' processed meats - such as bacon , salami , sausages , hot dogs and processed deli meats - may be the most important to avoid			2
based on our findings , eating one serving per week or less would be associated with relatively small risk			0
' last year , a massive number - crunching exercise has revealed that dishes with bacon really do taste better - and very few taste worse			1
@entity186 magazine @entity185 teamed up with the @entity187 to analyse 50,000 recipes and 906,539 comments on them			0
last year , a massive number - crunching exercise revealed that dishes with bacon - sandwiches in particular - really do taste better explaining how the results were calculated , @entity185 writer @entity193 said : ' first , we searched out all the recipes that fit a certain description - sandwiches , for example			2
' then , we calculated the average rating for those foods if they did not include the word “ bacon			0
” ' we ran the numbers again using only recipes that did include bacon			0
of all the foods we analysed , bacon lends the most improvement to sandwiches			0
' many other dishes also got a boost when bacon was added - when the data was analysed , those with with a rasher or two included got better scores			2
there are various theories as to why - not least because of the crunch and flavour bacon adds to sandwiches			2
it 's also a good addition to salads - providing it does n't go soggy			0
recipes with spinach and asparagus were all rated better when they contained bacon , for example			0
but it was n't all good news			0
there are foods that get worse with bacon - namely pasta ( particularly in creamy sauces ) and , rather unsurprisingly , desserts .			0

@entity7 sales rose by nearly 10 *%* last year to an all - time record of $ 4 billion
but doctors say bacon raises the risk of cancer , heart disease and diabetes
this may be *due* to the salt and preservatives in it
researchers add that combining it with maple syrup makes us crave it more
