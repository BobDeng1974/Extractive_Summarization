@entity5 said she screamed in terror when she finally spotted the corn snake , named @entity8 , coiled around the tray			1
the 11 - month - old snake had been missing from neighbour @entity12 's vivarium since it escaped two months ago			1
corn snake @entity8 was missing for two months before it was found coiled around @entity5 ' dinner tray @entity5 ( right ) said she screamed in terror when she saw the snake but @entity12 ( left ) was ' ecstatic ' about finding her son @entity18 missing pet a second snake is also on the loose and mrs @entity5 , 54 , said she now fears it will also show up in her house			1
she said @entity8 blended in so well with the wooden handle of her tray that she went to put her plate down on it			1
mrs @entity5 , from @entity27 in @entity28 , said : ' i noticed this face looking at me and i just screamed			1
' my husband thought i was overreacting as he thought it was a spider			0
i just launched the tray at him and ran into the kitchen			0
' ms @entity12 , 31 , had given up all hope of finding @entity8 , one of eight snakes that she looks after with her two children , @entity38 , 13 , and @entity18 , nine			2
she was overjoyed to find out he had been found on friday , june 14			0
she said : ' i could n't believe it , i was ecstatic as i did n't think i would see him again			0
' as i have gone in i saw @entity5 in the kitchen and did n't think anything of it but looking back she did look really startled			2
' mrs @entity5 is terrified her neighbour 's other missing snake , @entity47 ( pictured ) , will also show up in her house mrs @entity5 said : ' i can laugh about it now			1
i did n't realise how big he was , if i had seen the whole length of it i would be in hospital with a heart attack			0
' she said she was in hysterics and has no idea how the snake got into her semi-detached home			0
ms @entity12 said corn snakes are known for being ' escape artists ' but her son had not shut the vivarium properly which left a small gap for him to slither out of			2
although the family are thrilled to have @entity8 home , they are still hoping daughter @entity38 's bright pink corn snake , @entity47 , may turn up - she escaped a month before @entity8			1
ms @entity12 added : ' the house literally got demolished to try and find these snakes			2
' @entity18 is pleased because at least it 's not his fault any more , but @entity38 's gutted it was n't @entity47 that was found			0
' mrs @entity5 now fears the other snake may turn up elsewhere in her home			1
she added : ' i feel a bit apprehensive now , i think the other is in here too			0
' corn snakes , which are native to @entity81 , can grow up to 6ft long and prey on rodents , killing them by constriction			0
their reluctance to bite makes them popular pets , and in captivity they can live to be up to 23 years old .			0
