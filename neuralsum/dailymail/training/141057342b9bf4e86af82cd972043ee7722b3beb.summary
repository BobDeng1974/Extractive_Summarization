' she said : ' i kept throwing up and my skin would go really red			0
in the middle of the night i would be hanging my head out of the window because i was so hot and could n’t catch my breath and i would feel really dizzy			0
' i had a sharp pain in my tummy and i had not been measured on my stomach and people were saying that i was massive and looked ready to drop			0
the following week my legs blew up			0
' she was later referred to @entity45 when she said her unborn baby was not moving			2
' i was given two blood transfusions in my womb and sent home after five days but then within two days my waters broke when i got up in the morning , ' the mother said			2
comforting : @entity7 with parents @entity6 and @entity17			1
sadly the baby girl died at just two - days - old			1

@entity6 said : ' i could tell @entity64 was terrified			1
i could see it in his face			0

today @entity6 who lives with partner @entity17 , 30 , a hairdresser said : ' @entity64 and i were devastated			1
we just wanted her to be healthy and happy but she looked like she was suffering so badly , and that ’s the most awful thing for a mum to see in their child			0
' doctors said that she only had a one per cent chance of survival			0
it was just the machines that were keeping her alive			0
' in the end i felt relief for @entity7 but it was so hard to watch her slip away			1
i did n’t realise till that moment the machine was switched off that she had been in so much pain			0

slapped cheek syndrome is a type of viral infection that is most common in children , although it can affect anyone of any age			1
it is caused by a virus called @entity10 and the most common symptom is the appearance of a distinctive bright red rash on the cheeks			2
other symptoms can include painful joints and swollen limbs			2
pregnant women who have not had the infection before have an increased risk of a miscarriage			2
in one in three cases the mother passes the virus on to the unborn child , which can then cause severe anaemia			1
this in turn can cause heart failure and an abnormal collection of fluid inside the baby ’s tissues			0
due to this risk , mothers with the virus are given regular ultrasound scans so that the health of the baby can be carefully assessed			0
if they do show signs of severe anaemia , they may be treated with a blood @entity161 risk of miscarriage is highest in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy , at around 1 in 10 , but then drops sharply as the pregnancy progresses			1
' i would urge pregnant women who have the symptoms to get themselves checked out straight away before it ’s too late - if i ’d have known , i would have gone a lot sooner			2
' @entity10 is a common childhood viral illness with about half of all adults infected when they were children			1

ms @entity6 said : ' because i ’d never had @entity72 in childhood , my body did n’t have the antibodies to fight it off and protect the baby and she became anaemic , her kidneys stopped working and her heart had also swelled			2
' i still do n’t know how or where i contracted @entity72 but people can have it and not even know			0
