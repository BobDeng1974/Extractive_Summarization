thousands of paedophiles have rushed to use a new form from @entity2 giving them the ' right to be forgotten ' which lets people apply to get themselves removed from search results			1
the changes come after a landmark ruling by the @entity9 that people have the ' right to be forgotten ' - so they can have @entity2 search results removed if they tarnish their reputation			1
over 12,000 people across @entity14 have used the form since @entity2 launched the online form yesterday morning			1
if those requests are granted , anyone searching for those people on @entity2 will not be shown the aspects of their past that they have deemed to be embarrassing or damaging - making internet searches fundamentally less useful			1
@entity2 requests : at one point , yesterday , @entity2 said it was getting 20 requests per minute from people asking for their information to be taken down at one point @entity2 said it was getting 20 requests per minute			2
but the ruling has already been criticised after early indications that around 12 per cent of applications were related to paedophilia			0
a further 30 per cent concern fraud and 20 per cent were about people 's arrests or convictions			2
along with requests from paedophiles , many other applications have come from corrupt public figures and criminals desperate to hide their past			2
an actor who had an affair with a teenager , a celebrity 's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests			0
the company has set up a team of employees to deal with requests and sift through applications from people desperate to have personal information removed from search results			2
the team will decide exactly which grievances should be honoured under the @entity14 court ruling and which should not			2
however , the company said it will not honour every application and will look at each case based on its merit			0
these include cases connected with recent criminal convictions , professional malpractice and the conduct of government officials			0
what is the link ? those seeking to have information about them removed can visit the legal section of @entity2 's website or visit the link : @entity78 on this page , a form allows users to put in a search removal request under @entity85 data @entity83 ? only @entity85 citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to have their links removed if their legal name appears			1
they will have to explain why the link should be taken @entity91 will be considered ? all requests will be considered but @entity2 , but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest , the company has said it will not remove all @entity96 i do if a case is not resolved ? in @entity100 users can contact the @entity101 or take @entity2 to court			1
however , if these types of cases can not be resolved by @entity2 they may end up being looked at by @entity100 's privacy watchdog the @entity105 or go to a higher court			0
it means that @entity2 now finds itself in the prickly position of having to balance privacy concerns against the principles of free expression and ' the right to know			0
' critics say the @entity85 ruling has already created a divide between how @entity2 generates search results about some people in @entity14 and the rest of the world			1
for now at least , @entity2 will only scrub personal information spanning 32 - nations in @entity14			1
it means that googling the same person in the @entity122 and dozens of other countries could look much different than it does from @entity14			0
and although the court ruling currently applies to 28 countries in the @entity85 , @entity2 is extending the ' right to be forgotten ' to four other countries — @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
more than 500 million people live in the area affected by @entity2 's potential purge of personal information from its @entity14 search results			1
@entity2 said it has established a seven - person advisory committee including @entity138 , @entity139 who is @entity140 's founder and @entity141 , former director of @entity143 's @entity142 to look at the issues			0
concern : co-founder and ceo @entity146 has warned that a @entity14 court ruling on ' the right to be forgotten ' will help corrupt governments around the world however , in an interview with the @entity154 , @entity2 's co-founder @entity146 warned that the new law will be used by other governments to do bad things			1
he said : ' other people are going to pile on , probably ... for reasons most @entity14 would find negative			0

search *engine* now allows people to have links about them taken down
thousands of paedophiles have made requests to remove personal data
however , @entity2 says it will balance rights of individuals with public interest
most requests received relate to paedophilia , fraud , arrests and convictions
the ruling could fundamentally change the nature of the internet in @entity14
