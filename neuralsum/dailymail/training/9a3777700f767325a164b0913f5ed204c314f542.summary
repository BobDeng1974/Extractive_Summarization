@entity1 boss @entity0 seems convinced that the @entity3 and @entity4 officials are wagering some sort of war against his team			2
in his most recent television appearance , @entity0 appeared on @entity10 ' goals on sunday to discuss the various incidents that he believes have gone unfairly against the @entity13 club this season			2
although the @entity17 boss makes a compelling argument in some cases , there have been several occasions which have seen @entity1 lucky to escape without punishment			2
here , @entity22 looks at five moments when @entity0 's @entity1 side got away with it			1
@entity0 appeared on @entity10 ' goals on sunday after @entity1 's controversial 1 - 1 draw with @entity28 @entity0 was upset with this studs - up tackle from @entity29 which went unpunished on saturday @entity31 vs @entity32 @entity1 's star full - back has been one of @entity0 's most reliable soldiers this season , fighting for the cause and often popping up with crucial goals for his team			1
the @entity41 defender took his fighting spirit slightly too far during @entity1 's 1 - 0 win against @entity32 earlier this month as he became the main aggressor when both sets of players came together in an angry confrontation			2
@entity48 was shown a red card for a late challenge on @entity51 , but @entity31 , who grabbed @entity52 around the neck before aiming a slight headbutt towards his opponent escaped without a card			2
@entity31 then played a crucial part in @entity1 's winning goal , heading the ball towards goal before a @entity62 clearance was met with a fierce finish from @entity51			0
the @entity3 also decided against handing the 31 - year - old any retrospective punishment			0
@entity31 ( centre ) puts his left arm around the neck of @entity52 @entity31 ( third right ) appears to aim a headbutt in the direction of @entity52 on wednesday the incident took place during a melee in the closing stages of @entity1 's 1 - 0 win against @entity32 @entity31 ( left ) is embraced by @entity1 manager @entity0 after the final whistle on wednesday ' @entity0 is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign , but entitled to ask questions			1
his players , fine players , are frequently under siege			0
' click here to read @entity22 's chief sports writer @entity82 on @entity0 's @entity83 on sunday appearance @entity85 vs @entity86 @entity85 was lucky to stay on the pitch during @entity1 's shock 5 - 3 defeat to @entity86 on @entity90 , after kicking out at @entity91			1
with the score at 4 - 2 the @entity93 defender was tussling for the ball with @entity86 ' two - goal hero when the striker fell to the floor			0
@entity85 , who had earlier conceded a penalty for fouling @entity91 , took a swing at the forward , clattering him in the back			0
with the ball a good yard away it is difficult to see how @entity85 could claim to have been attempting to play it , particularly with @entity91 's whole body between the defender and the ball			0
@entity85 then appeared to stamp on the prone forward 's leg , although that was at least closer to the ball , and could have been an attempt to retrieve it			0
however , referee @entity115 seems not to have seen the incident , failing to punish the centre half for the violent play			0
@entity85 appears to kick @entity86 striker @entity91 during @entity86 's 5 - 3 victory in january @entity91 reacts in obvious pain , but neither the referee or his assistant seemed to notice the offence @entity85 vs @entity124 the @entity93 vice-captain made headlines for all the wrong reasons after taking an embarrassing dive during @entity1 's 2 - 0 victory against @entity124 in december			1
the dive , which @entity124 boss @entity131 claimed would be more fitting in ' @entity132 ' , came in the 53rd - minute as he passed between @entity133 and @entity134 in the @entity124 area			2
referee @entity136 did not give a penalty but he enraged @entity124 manager @entity131 by opting against showing @entity85 a second yellow			0
@entity85 goes down theatrically in the box for @entity1 during a 2 - 0 win against @entity124 in december the @entity1 defender was also on a yellow card and risked getting sent off @entity136 ( second right ) points for a goal kick and wrongly failed to produce a second yellow for @entity85 @entity85 vs @entity145 @entity0 's side were lucky not to concede a late penalty at @entity148 in november after @entity85 seemed to block a @entity150 strike with his forearm			1
the @entity153 defender had also been in the spotlight for a block in controversial block in the first half after he put his should towards @entity159 's effort			0
the @entity17 ended up holding onto their 2 - 1 lead to earn a valuable three points after goals from @entity85 and @entity163			1
even @entity1 skipper @entity165 conceded that @entity145 should have been awarded a penalty , saying : ' we have had some not go our way , it evens itself out '			0
@entity85 was at the centre of two handball appeals - the first coming after a @entity159 strike @entity150 appeals for a penalty after @entity85 's second controversial block during @entity1 's 2 - 1 victory the @entity1 players celebrate earning a vital three points at @entity148 in november , 2014 @entity163 vs @entity177 with the 2014 - 15 @entity4 season only five weeks old , @entity163 showed @entity93 a glimmer of his fiery side after a tangle with @entity124 defender @entity181			1
the @entity183 defender was rightly shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on @entity163 , who reacted by placing his hands around @entity181 's neck for a split second			1
@entity181 's sending off came moments before @entity190 gave @entity1 the lead , with @entity163 involved in the move leading to the goal			1
however , @entity194 came off the bench to rescue a point for the 10 - man champions against his former club			0
@entity181 ( right ) was shown a second yellow card for this challenge on @entity163 the @entity1 striker reacted angrily by placing his hands around @entity181 's neck the @entity183 defender is given his marching orders by referee @entity203			1

@entity0 believes @entity1 have been unfairly treated by officials
@entity1 should have been awarded two penalties during 1 - 1 draw against @entity28 on saturday
however , the @entity17 have been lucky on several occasions this season
@entity31 went unpunished for tussle with @entity52
@entity163 got away with putting his hands around @entity181 's neck
@entity85 should have seen a second yellow card for dive against @entity124
