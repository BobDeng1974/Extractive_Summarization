the government increasingly views @entity4 organisations and individuals with ' suspicion ' , a former @entity1 chairman has said			0
@entity6 , who quit as a @entity8 minister last august , criticised what she called a policy of non-engagement with the @entity4 community			1
the first @entity4 member of the @entity14 hit out at the failure to develop a friendship with the three - million strong @entity4 community in @entity18			1
' this is to view ever - increasing numbers of @entity4 organisations or individual activists with suspicion and dangerously narrow engagement to a dozen people from a community of more than three million			2
' @entity6 warned a letter sent by communities secretary @entity48 urging @entity4 leaders to do more to root out extremism had backfired			0
the letter was condemned as ' patronising and factually incorrect ' by some @entity52 , with many saying it gave the idea th at @entity52 and @entity55 are inherently apart from @entity18 society			1
while largely supportive of the intentions behind the letter from communities secretary @entity48 , whom she describes as a friend , @entity6 said the storm of criticism it provoked from some sections of the @entity4 community was unsurprising			1
communities secretary @entity48 , at an event organised by the @entity66 last weekend , wrote a letter urging @entity4 leaders to do more to root out extremism she said there had been almost six years of non-engagement , both by the previous @entity72 and now the coalition			2
' the reaction to the @entity76 letter underlines what i consistently argued for in government - that it was important for us to engage with a broad range of groups and individuals who purported to speak for the @entity64 , while accepting that , inevitably , some did n't do it very well , ' said @entity6			2
she said there had been a failure to tackle anti-muslim sentiment , and described the current climate within the @entity4 community as one of concern , worry and fear			0
' so it 's no surprise there is a trust deficit , a questioning of motive to a letter sent with the best of intentions			0
for too many , the hand of friendship felt like an admonitory finger that was once again pointing at @entity18 's @entity52 , ' she said			1
@entity6 also said it was sad that her calls for a meeting , similar to the annual one the prime minister has with the @entity111 , with members of other major faith communities had not been answered			0
@entity115 , @entity72 's shadow justice secretary , said : ' when the most senior @entity4 is so scathing about her own party , we should all sit up and listen			0
these comments confirm that @entity119 's conservatives are out - of - touch and have nothing to offer @entity18 muslims			1
only @entity72 truly represents all of @entity18 's communities			0
