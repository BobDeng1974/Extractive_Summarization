by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 claimed it had been a ' good day ' for his @entity5 policy after former @entity7 chancellor @entity6 dramatically called for @entity8 to leave the @entity9			1
the explosive intervention threatened to destroy @entity7 unity around the prime minister 's pledge to hold an in - out referendum if he wins the 2015 general election			1
but mr @entity2 brushed aside fears the issue could hijack his next two years in power , insisting only he was willing to give voters a say on severing ties with @entity21			2
@entity2 , pictured today , insisted it had been a ' good day ' for his referendum pledge lord @entity6 , 81 , described the @entity9 as ‘ a bureaucratic monstrosity ’ and said leaving ‘ would substantially outweigh the costs ’			1
' the case for exit is clear , ' he said			1
@entity29 ’s longest - serving chancellor pledged to vote no in any referendum on membership , in a move that piles further pressure on mr @entity2 , emboldening @entity7 eurosceptics and threatening the stability of the coalition			1
but mr @entity2 played down the threat to his position			2
he told a press conference : ' i think it has been a good day for the pledge that i have made that , if re-elected , i will hold an in / out referendum so that everybody can have not just a voice about @entity8 's future in @entity5 but also have a vote about @entity8 's future in @entity5			1
' i welcome the attention that has been placed on this key pledge that i have made			0
only a @entity7 government , only the conservatives of the major parties , are making this promise			2
' i want to give people a choice not between the status quo and leaving the @entity9			1
i want to give people a choice between @entity8 remaining in a reformed @entity9 or leaving that @entity9			1
that is the choice that people want and there is only one way to get it and that is by supporting the @entity7 at the next election			2
' ' bureaucratic monstrosity ' : lord @entity6 says the @entity9 has served its purpose and @entity8 should now withdraw the prime minister will use this week 's @entity66 to react to the rise of the @entity8 @entity68 , which won more than 140 council seats in last week 's local elections			1
he had hoped the promise to renegotiate a new deal with @entity21 , followed by a referendum by 2017 , would placate @entity34 in his party			2
mr @entity2 would campaign to stay in the @entity9			1
but lord @entity6 ridiculed the plan as ' inconsequential ' , with @entity8 ' consistently outvoted ' by countries in the @entity77			1
he said the nature of the @entity9 had ' fundamentally change ' since the creation of the single currency			2
' that is why , while i voted “ in ” in 1975 , i shall be voting “ out ” in 2017 , ' he wrote in @entity84			0
while there would be ‘ some economic cost ’ from leaving the @entity9 single market , @entity6 went on , ‘ in my judgment the economic gains would substantially outweigh the costs			1
’ he called the @entity9 ‘ an institution that has achieved its historic purpose and is now past its sell - by date ’ and said @entity8 industry should focus on the developing world			1
mr @entity2 is resisting pressure to hold a referendum next spring in which voters would be asked if they supported a looser relationship with @entity21			2
in january @entity2 set out his detailed timetable for staging a historic referendum on @entity8 's membership of the @entity9			1
he received plaudits in january when he promised that if he is still prime minister after the 2015 general election , he would seek a ' fresh settlement ' with the @entity9 before putting it to the people in a referendum			1
but he made clear that he thought @entity8 was better off in the @entity9			1
lord @entity6 likened the idea of renegotiating terms with @entity21 to similar talks held by @entity113 prime minister @entity112 40 years ago			1
' the changes that @entity112 was able to negotiate were so trivial that i doubt if anyone today can remember what they were			0
but he was able to secure a 2 - 1 majority for the “ in ” vote in the 1975 referendum			0
' i have no doubt that any changes that mr @entity2 — or , for that matter , @entity125 — is able to secure will be equally inconsequential '			2
in recent weeks the rise of @entity127 has startled the political establishment , culminating in dramatic gains in last week 's council elections in which mr @entity132 's party took almost one in four votes			1
today mr @entity132 seized on @entity6 's article , saying it ' legitimises the @entity127 position and exposes serious divisions in the @entity7 '			1
but deputy prime minister @entity138 said @entity7 policy on @entity5 should not be shaped by a knee - jerk response to the threat posed by @entity127			1
' i know the @entity7 are struggling to work out how to deal with @entity127 and they keep now changing their minds : one minute they want to be in the @entity9 , now senior conservatives like @entity6 say they want to go out , ' he told @entity145 's @entity144			1
' i think we need to transform the @entity9 to make it more transparent more efficient , more democratic where we can , but not turn our backs on it because doing so would make us less safe and less prosperous			2
' @entity127 leader @entity132 said @entity6 's intervention ' legitimises ' his own calls for exit from the @entity9 while @entity152 leader @entity138 said the @entity153 were ' struggling ' to cope with the rise of @entity127 mr @entity138 warned that leaving the @entity9 ' would jeopardise up to three million jobs in this country '			1
senior @entity7 backbenchers want mr @entity2 to deliver on his hint last week that he could bring forward legislation on staging a referendum before 2015			1
@entity8 must do more to understand @entity5 , a senior @entity21 commissioner has suggested			2
trade commissioner @entity162 said @entity8 politicians did not need to ' love ' the @entity9 , but needed to get to know it better			1
' it ’s really amazing how little a lot of @entity8 politicians know about @entity5 , ' he told @entity167			0
' you need decision on the basis of facts and figures and arguments , not on the basis of myths			0
why do n’t people tell the truth about the @entity9			2
' they should get better acquainted with it			0
we do n’t want you to love @entity5 , love should be kept for personal relationships			0
but look at your own interests and ‘ de-dramatise ’ all this			0
' he warned @entity8 leaders against a ' blame game ' with @entity21 for the @entity8 's problems			2
the prime minister said : ‘ i think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum			0
‘ anything we can to do to strengthen that offer i am prepared to consider			0
’ but without the support of @entity152 in a @entity196 vote , it is almost certain to be defeated			0
former @entity7 minister sir @entity197 said mr @entity2 faces a ' big challenge '			1
' if those changes that he can secure are ‘ inconsequential ’ , in the words of @entity6 , then clearly that will leave us with only one option , which is to leave , ' he told @entity204			0
' and i think the challenge for our @entity5 partners - that ’s actually a rather bigger challenge for them than it is for us - is to come up with some substantial changes that will meet the aspirations of the @entity8 people who are becoming increasingly more eurosceptic			1
' a @entity215 spokesman said : ' the pm has always been clear : we need a @entity5 that is more open , more competitive , and more flexible ; a @entity5 that wakes up to the modern world of competition			0
in short , @entity5 has to reform			0
' but our continued membership must have the consent of the @entity8 people , which is why the @entity216 has set out a clear timetable on this issue			1
' both @entity113 and the @entity152 are opposed to mr @entity2 's idea of a referendum , arguing it would create uncertainty and risk jobs			2
but @entity113 leader @entity125 is under pressure from senior backbenchers to back the idea of giving voters a say			0
@entity233 , @entity113 chairman of the home affairs select committee , said on @entity235 : ' an in / out referendum before the next election would clear the air			0
we could actually hold it on the day of the next general election			0
' it comes as one of the euro ’s most prominent cheerleaders has called for the single currency to be scrapped			0
senior labour mp @entity233 backed the idea of an early referendum to ' clear the air ' rethink : @entity251 , who was @entity252 's finance minister when the euro was adopted has called for the currency to be broken up so that southern @entity5 can recover from economic crisis former @entity252 finance minister @entity251 warned the current course is ‘ leading to disaster ’ and the ‘ situation is worsening from month to month ’			0
he said crisis - hit countries in southern @entity5 , including @entity263 , will be ‘ forced by their current misery to fight back against @entity252 hegemony sooner or later ’			0
it marks a stunning u-turn for the left - wing politician , @entity252 ’s finance minister when the euro was launched in 1999			0
critics labelled him @entity5 ’s most dangerous man after he called for the ‘ end of the nation state ’ in favour of a ‘ united @entity5 ’ in 1998			0
but the euro crisis has caused mr @entity251 to change his tune			0
awakening : mr @entity251 said that @entity252 chancellor @entity275 would ' awake from her self - righteous slumber ' once troubled eurozone countries forced through a change in policy at @entity252 's expense the 69 - year - old former minister says the single currency must be broken up to allow bailed - out countries , including @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 , to recover			0
he said : ‘ the economic situation is worsening from month to month and unemployment has reached a level that puts democratic structures ever more in doubt			0
’ he added that chancellor @entity275 ‘ will awake from her self - righteous slumber ’ when the troubled countries unite , forcing policy changes at @entity252 ’s expense			0
in a final admission that the single currency had failed , mr @entity251 said : ‘ hopes that the creation of the euro would force rational economic behaviour on all sides were in vain			0

lord @entity6 says benefits of exit outweigh ' *marginal* ' costs
says @entity9 has served its purpose : ' the case for exit is clear '
dramatic intervention will embolden @entity153 putting pressure on @entity2
@entity127 's @entity132 says @entity6 ' exposes serious divisions ' in @entity7 party
deputy pm @entity138 warns against ' running after ' @entity127 votes
@entity7 *mps* say the @entity8 people are ' increasingly more @entity34 '
