@entity0 , the @entity1 player of the season barred by @entity3 , has again let it be known that he might try to qualify to play for @entity5 in the @entity6			1
supporters of the dynamic @entity9 flanker , last capped by @entity3 in 2010 , indicated in june that he was thinking along those lines and further reports yesterday suggest he is still considering the @entity13 option			1
a frustrated @entity0 could be playing with fire , though			2
the slightest doubt over his allegiance and any sense that he is trying to force @entity3 ’s hand will not amuse head coach @entity20 , who puts great store by old - fashioned patriotism and commitment to the squad			1
a run of injuries to the likes of @entity41 and @entity42 might be considered exceptional			0
@entity0 ’s possible entry to the @entity13 squad would come via a loophole in the @entity47 qualifying regulations for the @entity49 tournament which allows a player to play for another nation if they hold a passport for the new country and have not played international rugby for 18 months			1
if such a player appears in the forthcoming @entity56 for that new country , he would be available for selection at fifteens			0
@entity0 would have to be granted a @entity13 passport — not a given — while it is understood that the @entity62 squad , should they be minded to pick him , would require him to play in three or four of the @entity49 tournaments around the world , involving considerable time away from @entity9 during the season			1
club duty : @entity0 looks on during the @entity69 final for his club @entity9 against @entity71 in @entity72 it is also thought that @entity5 legend @entity74 , who has been drafted in to help coach @entity75 , is against overseas players qualifying for @entity5 in such a way or through the three - year residency rule in the case of uncapped players			2
meanwhile , @entity20 has confirmed he has reached agreement with the @entity83 clubs to delay the selection and announcement of his senior @entity3 and @entity87 squads until october , which will be a big help in assessing current form			2
an extended 55 - man @entity3 squad began a three - day fitness testing camp in @entity93 last night , while a review of the 3 - 0 series defeat against @entity97 in june is also planned			2
top class : the dynamic flanker won the @entity1 player of the season award but is not in the @entity3 frame among the notable inclusions were loose - head prop @entity104 and back row @entity105 , both of whom have returned to the national set - up after lengthy spells out with knee injuries			0
sale fly - half @entity112 kept his place after returning to the @entity3 fold on the summer tour to @entity97 , while @entity119 back row @entity117 is a new name			0
@entity20 said : ‘ this camp will give us a chance to get the wider squad together and an opportunity to review the @entity97 tour			0
it will be an important few days			0
the next time we meet will be two weeks before we play @entity97 in the @entity128 , so this time together is vital			0
’ loophole : @entity0 could qualify for @entity5 through a loophole that would involve the @entity49 @entity130 revoir imminent for @entity131			1

@entity0 has let it be known he might try to qualify for @entity5
he was last capped by @entity3 in 2010 and is now considering a swap
@entity20 is not likely to be *impressed* by his @entity13 flirting
@entity0 could qualify through a loophole involving the @entity49
