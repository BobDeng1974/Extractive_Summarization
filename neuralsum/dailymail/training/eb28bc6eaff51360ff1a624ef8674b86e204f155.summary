@entity0 is still searching for a number of players to improve @entity4 's chances of @entity6 survival but insists keeping @entity7 would feel like a new signing			1
signed from @entity9 in january 2013 , @entity7 proved an instant hit with the club 's fans but could not prevent the @entity4 from slipping to relegation			1
having spent last season on loan at @entity17 while @entity4 battled back into the top flight through the play - offs , @entity7 's long - term future appeared to be away from @entity20 , but a summer move to @entity22 collapsed			1
now the @entity24 forward is preparing to start the new campaign at @entity26 , with @entity0 impressed by his application since rejoining his team - mates			2
transfer : @entity0 said persuading @entity7 to stay at @entity4 would be like a new signing second spell : @entity7 was a hit at @entity4 when he first signed for the club , but could n't stop them going down ' i 'm hoping @entity7 stays , ' the 67 - year - old said in his @entity38 blog			1
' it will be like a new signing if he does			2
his attitude has been fantastic since he has come back , so we will have no problem welcoming him back into the side			0
' if he is going to go , we need to know as soon as we can so we can get a replacement in			0
' so far @entity0 has looked to add experience and competition to his defensive ranks with @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 all coming in , the latter on loan from @entity54 , with midfielder @entity55 also signed from @entity56			1
although the former @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 boss is keen to add numbers to his squad before the transfer window closes , @entity0 knows there are limitations on what the club can spend			2
money : the @entity4 manager said he wants to sing more players but understands the financial contraints ' we 're still short , certainly need another three or four players , ' he said			2
' the chairman ( @entity74 ) is working hard at getting the right players in , but these things take time			0
we can only spend what we can spend , so it 's certainly not easy			0
' @entity0 confirmed @entity79 is likely to depart in the coming weeks , with @entity81 international midfied duo @entity80 and @entity82 linked with moves to the west @entity85 club			1
after replacing @entity86 at @entity4 in november 2012 , @entity0 was unable to keep the @entity87 's in the @entity6 but , with a much - changed squad , that is his main goal this time around			1
signing : @entity49 has joined @entity4 from @entity90 and could partner @entity50 in defence ' if we can stay - up i 'd be delighted , ' he added			1
' if you offered me fourth from bottom now , i 'd bite your hand off			0
i could talk cobblers and say we want to finish in the top half			0
' but just to stay in the @entity6 would be great for us - consolidate and keep building			0
we have been a yo - yo club for too long , we just need to become an established @entity6 club			0
