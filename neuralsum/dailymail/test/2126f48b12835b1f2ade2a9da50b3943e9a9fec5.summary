@entity1 , 62 , slept in a cardboard box in @entity4 for three years
he applied for homeless housing , but struggled as he had no identification
it had all been stolen years earlier - *virtually* forcing him onto the streets
a case *worker* and a cop looked into his past and *uncovered* his records
@entity64 then went into a @entity50 bank and discovered a lost account
enough money and social security was in there for him to buy a house
