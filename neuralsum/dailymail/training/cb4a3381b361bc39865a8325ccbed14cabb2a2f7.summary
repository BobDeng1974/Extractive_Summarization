he was signed up for his local blood donation program at the age of one and has been ever present since			2
bloodhound : @entity5 , pictured with veterinary nurse @entity16 , is thought to be one of the leading blood donor dogs in the @entity8 lifesaver : the crossbreed has helped save the live of hundreds of dogs by donating blood over the past seven years regular donor : the loveable pet donates every six weeks - the recommended time frame by vets - meaning he has donated the maximum amount of blood possible and saved more than 200 dogs ' lives the dog donates every six weeks - the recommended time frame by vets - meaning he has donated the maximum amount of blood possible and saved more than 200 dogs ' lives			1
with @entity8 's canine blood banks currently experiencing a shortage in supplies , more dogs like @entity5 are desperately needed , especially as he is close to retirement			1
dogs will usually donate between 230cc and 430cc of blood , which , if they donate as regularly possible for the seven year donation period , means they can save between 112 and 224 lives			2
given @entity5 's age , size and the frequency of his visits , it is believed he is one of the most prolific blood donating dogs in the country , with the biggest donor unknown			1
helping hand : donor handler @entity57 holds @entity5 down as a veterinary nurse prepares to take blood from the dog happy donor : @entity5 remains calm as the nurse begins to extract some of his blood result : the canine blood is stored in a freezer carton ready to be donated to a dog in need @entity67 , from the @entity68 in @entity69 , where @entity5 's blood is sent , estimates he has saved around 224 lives and counting			2
his owner , @entity72 , 33 , from @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity8 , said : ' the first visit he spent in my lap - he was just a little unsure about what was going on and they just took a small sample for testing			0
' ever since then he has been fine and happily follows the vet out to the room			0
' when he thinks we 're going to donate he starts barking in the car close to the vet office in excitement			0
' he actually pulls me into the donation room and jumps right up on the table			0
if he has to wait for another dog to finish , he 'll bark to let them know he 's ready for his turn			0
devoted : owner @entity72 , pictured here with @entity5 , has been donating blood since he was one she added : ' we think @entity5 can donate for another year - probably until he turns 9			1
we 're so proud to think of all the other dogs he has been able to give a longer life to			0
' dogs can replenish their blood in about three weeks so vet @entity67 has dogs donate once every five to seven weeks to make it convenient for their owners			2
she said : ' our schedule changes - sometimes it 's seasonal , sometimes it relates to nationwide disasters			0
' we travel to up to seven donor sites a week and try to schedule between 15 - 20 dogs per site but most often we end up with less			2
close to retirement : @entity5 has a well - earned rest after donating blood hero : @entity67 , from the @entity68 in @entity69 , where @entity5 's blood is sent , estimates he has saved around 224 lives and counting ' there is no way to predict what we will need or what we will collect which is why it 's important to have committed donors and their owners like @entity5 and @entity72 in our program			1
' a dog like @entity5 who has been an awesome donor for seven years and given at the consistent frequency of every six weeks could have saved between 112 - 224 dogs had all of their components been used already			1
' some of the components have a longer shelf life so the plasma could potentially be sitting in a vet 's freezer waiting for a potential emergency			0
' all of the red cells must be used within a 42 day period so those would have been used already			0

the eight - year - old crossbreed has been donating blood since he was one
the dog donates every six weeks but is now close to retirement age
vets are looking for more dogs like @entity5 with blood in short supply
