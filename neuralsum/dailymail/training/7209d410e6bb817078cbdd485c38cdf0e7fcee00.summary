yesterday i witnessed the extraordinary sight of hordes of suicide bombers , dressed in black and brandishing @entity4 , marching through the slums of @entity6			1
grouped into makeshift platoons – some wearing white shrouds to denote their readiness to die – they demonstrated their deadly skills in an astonishing display by ‘ detonating ’ the bombs they carried			1
they were part of the private army of powerful cleric @entity18 , an enemy of @entity19 and the @entity20 who inflicted terrible damage on @entity23 troops after the 2003 @entity20 - led invasion of @entity25			1
the @entity40 – which has vowed to protect @entity6 and its holy shrines to the death – is now battling alongside government troops to defend an @entity25 on the verge of collapse against advancing @entity47 militants			1
their march came on yet another day of fighting and bloodshed as : the reappearance of the @entity40 comes a few months after @entity18 announced his withdrawal from politics citing disillusionment with the corruption of prime minister @entity57 ’s government			1
but it has taken less than two weeks for him to mobilise his private army again in response to the @entity29 attacks in the north			1
@entity63 himself headed up a military show of strength in @entity68 city , his headquarters , while i and thousands watched a fighting force of men , women and young boys in combat gear and balaclavas brandished rifles , rocket - propelled grenades and truckloads of ground - to - air missiles march through the heart of @entity6 for several hours			2
display of strength : @entity85 fighters , loyal to the @entity86 cleric @entity18 , take part in a military parade on the streets of @entity6 they closed off the highways as they made their way through @entity92 , a slum area home to more than a million @entity86			1
the platoons assembled according to their city districts			0
many were from @entity92 , which has become a no - go zone due to roadside bombs and tension between the poor militant @entity86 population there and displaced @entity47 , many of whom feel excluded from the government			1
as the sheikhs on the podium recited the @entity107 , i saw fighters fall to their knees in prayer			0
it was a day when almost everyone had come out to fight , the aggressive platoons , boasting of their engineering , bomb - making skills			2
the suicide - bomb brigade broke ranks as it passed the podium			2
at a sign from the sheikhs , the men in balaclavas and ammo - vests went into operational mode , staking out a target , crouching low on the ground and ‘ detonating ’ their charges with bravado			0
the message over loudspeakers all along the route was threefold : ‘ @entity134 ( @entity29 ) militants see our power today ; let prime minister @entity57 see we are stronger than his government and his army ; and tell the @entity25 people not to be afraid , we will win this war for you			1
’ the clerics boomed out encouragement : ‘ to all those willing to die for @entity25 , your souls will go to heaven			2
we will pray for you			0
’ not a shot was fired during this showy parade			0
but later yesterday , four people were killed by four roadside bombs in @entity6 , two of them in @entity92			2
it was twice the daily average for this volatile city			0
@entity63 ’s powerful display in @entity6 came as @entity29 militants claimed to control 75 per cent of the crucial @entity156 oil refinery in the north - east , flying its signature black flag over the installation			1
weaponry : thousands of @entity86 militiamen marched through the slums as the @entity29 surge continued in parts of @entity25 it boasted of trapping 270 @entity25 soldiers inside and threatened to starve them into surrender			1
@entity168 workers there were evacuated before the attack , but @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 employees are believed to be hostages			0
the effect on oil prices has been instantaneous with @entity178 rising to a nine - month high of $ 115.06 a barrel by friday			0
meanwhile , around 400 troops were flown to @entity182 and @entity183 to fight the militants now running both cities , extorting money from local firms , and raiding shops and banks			0
@entity25 ’s army , stretched to the limit in fierce battles in cities and surrounding towns , and at @entity196 airport , has been forced to work with former foes such as the vicious @entity198 – the @entity199 , and other free - ranging @entity86 militias			1
@entity6 itself , the seat of government and the last bastion standing against @entity29 , which has total control of @entity206 to the west and is winning the battle for important towns in @entity210 to the north - east , was yesterday in lockdown			1
parade : they have signalled their readiness to take on the @entity47 militants			2
however some have questioned the army 's ability to take on @entity29 hundreds of new checkpoints , both police and military , have appeared over the past few days			2
traffic comes to a standstill as documents , vehicles , drivers and passengers are thoroughly and laboriously checked			0
in the siege mentality which prevails , many are determined to sit it out come what may			0
despite reports of people fleeing , there are seats on most flights out and no flood of traffic away from the city centre			0
at @entity6 ’s only @entity243 church , @entity241 ’s , yesterday father @entity240 said : ‘ i am staying here and my congregation is staying here			2
if necessary i will die with my people			0
‘ we have our communion services and our youth meetings and our mothers ’ @entity248			0
we pray for peace all the time of course , now more than ever , but we also take food rations to the soldiers at the checkpoint outside and we encourage our @entity260 friends to join us when they can			0
‘ we have heard it all for many years and still we are finding the strength to go on			0
we pray for peace all the time of course , now more than ever			0
against all odds we have a good relationship with peace - loving @entity86			0
we hope for a miracle , to see @entity6 free again one day			2
’ @entity269 : @entity18 , a powerful figure in @entity25 since the fall of @entity272 the man leading the @entity86 show of strength against @entity29 is @entity18 , a powerful figure in @entity25 since the fall of @entity272			1
after the toppling of the dictator in 2003 , the radical cleric called for a national rebellion against @entity23 troops , sending out his @entity40 militiamen to confront the @entity19 and @entity20 ‘ invaders ’			1
his followers patrolled the streets of @entity6 ’s @entity86 suburbs , taking on many functions of local government and renaming the @entity92 area to @entity92 , which became a no - go area for coalition forces			1
last year , he said he was laying down his arms			0
but now he is allying his forces with the @entity25 troops defending @entity6 from @entity29 ’s @entity47 extremists			1
last night , a @entity86 cleric loyal to @entity18 said their anti-western views remained and that the 300 @entity20 military advisers en route to @entity25 would be attacked .			1

hordes of suicide bombers , holding *kalashnikovs* , paraded the streets
some were wearing white shrouds to denote their readiness to die
they were part of the private army of powerful cleric @entity18
officials admitted that @entity29 – the @entity29 – has seized a *strategically* important border *crossing* to @entity315 , near the town of @entity317 , killing 30 troops after a day - long battle ;
about 270 @entity25 troops remained trapped inside the @entity156 oil refinery as they struggled to defend it ;
@entity325 denied that @entity20 ’s *failure* to send arms and *equipment* to rebels in @entity315 had left a power vacuum in @entity25 , which has aided the rise of @entity29 ;
there was *constant* *skirmishing* 40 miles from @entity6 , with militant @entity47 rebels apparently preparing for a thrust from the west .
