half of all cancer cases are spotted at a late stage when treatment is less likely to be successful , experts have warned			1
they calculate that more than 52,000 patients a year are having their odds of survival cut because the disease is not being caught quickly enough			2
the shocking figure is based on huge variations in diagnosis around @entity12 , with some cancers almost five times as likely to be diagnosed late in some parts of the country as others			1
lung cancer is the most likely to be spotted late – with fewer than one in four cases caught early			1
late diagnosis is blamed on factors from a ‘ stiff upper lip ’ to gps under pressure not to refer patients for costly tests			2
@entity27 , which commissioned the analysis of @entity30 data , said that early diagnosis is ‘ crucial to give patients the best chance of survival ’			0
delays in treatment can not only be deadly , but can also mean patients are subjected to much more aggressive treatments than would have been necessary earlier in the disease ’s progress			0
for instance , a woman with breast cancer might only have surgery if the tumour is spotted early			1
but if the disease has spread , she may face rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well			0
overall , 46 per cent of cancer in @entity12 are diagnosed at an advanced stage – when they have spread to other parts of the body , making them harder to treat			1
the figure rises to 77 per cent for lung cancer , @entity59 ’s biggest cancer killer			1
when it is diagnosed early , seven in ten patients will live at least a year – compared to around one in four when found late			1
@entity27 ’s chief executive @entity63 said : ‘ not to invest in earlier diagnosis is to fail cancer patients ' if every part of the country did as well as the best , the ‘ survival prospects ’ of more than 52,000 patients a year would be improved , the @entity67 report estimates			0
this does not mean all would be cured – some would simply live longer or be spared gruelling treatments			0
but 5,000 more patients would be alive five years after diagnosis			0
the added cost of treating advanced cancer means that catching the disease early would also save the @entity30 an estimated £ 210million a year			1
@entity27 ’s chief executive @entity63 said : ‘ not to invest in earlier diagnosis is to fail cancer patients			0
‘ earlier diagnosis saves lives and it could save critical @entity30 funds - and in the face of an overstretched @entity30 and a projected growing number of cancers diagnosed in the years ahead , we need to do everything we can to ensure that all patients have access to the best treatment as early as possible			2
’ @entity12 said it is working to improve outcomes for patients though earlier diagnosis			2
it added that survival rates have ‘ never been higher ’ .			0

lung cancer is most likely to be spotted late – with fewer than 1 in 4 cases caught early
46 *%* of cancers in @entity12 are diagnosed at an advanced stage
