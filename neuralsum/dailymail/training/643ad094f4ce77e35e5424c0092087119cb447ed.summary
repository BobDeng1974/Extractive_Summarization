' it does n't make any sense ' : @entity5 mom @entity14 was aghast when her son 's report card said ' good job ' and won him a spot on the honor roll despite his getting a c and a d @entity14 ’s son had several a grades in addition to his two less than stellar marks			1
‘ i immediately assumed it 's a mistake , ’ @entity14 told @entity32			0
the a grades managed to offset the @entity26 and @entity27 in the point system used to determine who makes it to the honor roll			2
by the @entity43 system , even students with an ‘ f ’ can get onto the honor roll so long as they get enough a ’s as well			2
broken system ? @entity46 principal @entity45 says that honor roll is awarded based on a point system and even students who get fs are still eligible ' it makes my job at home so difficult ' : @entity54 said the @entity5 school 's policy sets a bad example for the kids and complained to administrators ‘ the bottom line is , there is nothing honorable about making a @entity63 , ’ @entity14 said			1

@entity46 principal @entity45 said the **messages** were common on report cards , but agreed that the honor roll system may have a few kinks
