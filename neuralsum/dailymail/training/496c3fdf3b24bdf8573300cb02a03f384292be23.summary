by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 at this most democratic of @entity6 , the warm connection between @entity3 and the fans is quite something to see			1
‘ all right there @entity3 , lad , ’ was one greeting shouted from @entity10 ’s bulging galleries on friday morning as his lolloping stride came down the sixth fairway in his stellar grouping that also featured @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity3 is from southern @entity17 but has sufficient understanding of the @entity20 accent to recognise cordiality when he hears it , and responded with a smile and a ‘ how ya doin ? ’ upbeat : @entity3 played with the purpose that suggests he believes he is capable of repeating 2013 triumph in many sports , defending champions are less preferred than underdogs but not the 44 - year - old @entity29 , whose general willingness to engage adds to the perception that with the advent of middle age he has matured into a good egg			1
he has a man - of - the - people quality that particularly resonates in an area where golf has a strong blue - collar following			2
the @entity44 story of local qualifier @entity45 being a factory worker has attracted worldwide attention , but there are plenty of men on the shopfloor who enjoy the sport in these parts			0
@entity3 got huge support from the bumper crowds , but then he hardly failed to entertain , mixing dazzling mastery of the gusty winds with the odd basic error that showed that he is human like the rest of us			1
while @entity14 laboured and @entity15 spent much of the time with a quizzical look on his face , @entity3 played with the purpose that suggests he believes he is capable of repeating his triumph of @entity67 2013			1
focused : @entity15 and @entity3 tee off on the fifth during the second round on friday his morale going into the weekend was lifted by draining a 10 - foot putt for birdie on the 18th			1
of rediscovering his best form , he said : ‘ it ’s really close to being good			0
i ’m striking it so good			0
and if i putt the way i putted the last nine holes then this weekend i ’m going to have a good chance			2
if the wind stays up then i absolutely have a chance			0
’ @entity3 hit a miraculous second shot to within an inch on the fourth , but his mood had darkened after the seventh , where he missed a birdie putt , and he was still spewing on the next hole , which led him to make a hash of a chip that also cost him			1
consequently there was not much banter around the turn , especially after he lost his ball off the tee on the 10th , @entity10 ’s best birdie chance			2
amends were made when he made an eagle from his provisional , thus saving his par. he carded a two - under 70 , leaving him level par after the first two rounds			1
the years , the victories and the vagaries of life outside golf have , he said afterwards , made it easier to come to terms with not getting the better of the draw			0
‘ you accept that as part of the tournament			0
the conditions i had did n’t allow for it and , rather than force it , i have to play as well as i can with the conditions			0
‘ i might be seven or eight back but if i try to force it then i ’m going to be missing the cut			0
’ that was the fate of @entity14 , whose @entity6 looked ill - fated from the moment on thursday ’s opening hole when he struck an elderly spectator			2
trying to come to terms with the switch back to an orthodox putter from the ghastly broomhandle is not proving easy , and the previous evening he did not leave the putting green until 7.30pm , long after his finish			0
struggle : @entity14 and @entity15 failed to make the cut after two disappointing rounds his drive off the fifth could have caused a similar accident to day one , because it was so far left it only just cleared the stand for the seventh green before landing in the gorse , sending him back to try again			1
before the tournament @entity14 was effusive about his love for @entity138 , a place where he won as a junior , but he skulked off last night without explaining himself , having scored a 73 for a two - round eight - over 152			2
@entity15 rarely got out his pink driver and a bogey on the last was likely to mean him missing the cut , despite being level for the day and four over for the tournament			1
he pledged to go back to his digs and commiserate with housemate @entity147 , another early departure			0
‘ i ca n’t wait to get back home to see my wife and child , ’ he said			0
unlike @entity3 , who prepared at last week ’s @entity6 , @entity15 has been out of @entity29 for all of seven days			1
that is clearly more than enough .			0

@entity3 drained a 10 - foot putt for birdie on the 18th
the @entity29 finished on level par , *12* shots off leader @entity159
@entity15 and @entity14 failed to make the cut at @entity10
