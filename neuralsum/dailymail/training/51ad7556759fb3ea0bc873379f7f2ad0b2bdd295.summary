when @entity1 had a quiet word in @entity4 's ear earlier this summer , not even the @entity0 could have known the impact it would have			1
new managerial appointments often breed apprehension among players			0
am i in the team ? am i out ? will he keep me ? will i be sold ? @entity4 was no different			2
that was until a conversation with his new manager during pre-season			0
@entity4 scored the winning goal against @entity19 in the @entity20 on tuesday night @entity4 's effort rocketed in from 30 yards as @entity22 stunned the @entity23 the @entity22 defender has shown he is among the most consistent defenders in the league @entity4 is congratulated by @entity22 team - mate @entity27 after their 2 - 1 away win at the @entity23 the defender was told in no uncertain terms by his new boss that he would be the club 's first choice right back this season			1
it was music to @entity4 's ears ; with the seeds from that discussion now bearing fruit			1
his performances so far this season have been excellent			0
so good in fact that there 's now a growing clamour for him to be given @entity47 recognition			0
more performances like his against @entity19 on tuesday night then surely @entity48 will have to sit up and take notice			1
' yes , i think he is ready for @entity47 , ' said @entity1			0
' he has a lot of experience			0
he is playing very well from the beginning of the season and scored a great goal and his performance is very good and he is an option for the national coach			0
' but i ’m very happy to have him in our team because he brings a lot of quality and experience			0
it is very important for the team			0
' so it raises the question , have @entity68 bought the wrong @entity22 full back ? @entity71 's talent is undoubted , and if all goes according to plan , will become one of the world 's elite left backs			1
@entity68 splashed out £ 30million on @entity22 's former left back @entity71 @entity77 also decided to bring in @entity79 's left - sided defender @entity78 from @entity80 but the capture of @entity78 , who can play at left back or centre back , has raised doubts over @entity71 's place in @entity77 's plans			1
as did comments from former @entity68 coach and @entity89 's countryman @entity88 , who claimed the @entity91 manager does n't rate @entity71			1
@entity89 also has problems on the other side of his defence			0
@entity95 currently occupies the right - back spot , despite the fact the @entity0 was open to selling him in the summer transfer window			2
perhaps a look at the other side of @entity22 's defence last season would have been more beneficial for @entity68			2
@entity89 was willing to sell @entity95 , pictured with @entity103 and @entity104 , during the summer @entity4 's rise to prominence has been steady			1
@entity110 , during his first stint in charge at @entity109 , plucked the unknown @entity4 from the club 's academy and straight into his first team in 2008			1
all the hype at the time centred on @entity116 and @entity117			0
very little had been mentioned about @entity4 - who was just 17 at the time			2
but it did n't take long for the youngster to establish himself as the club 's first - choice right back ahead of the experienced @entity122			2
@entity4 was attracting attention from @entity68 and @entity19 during his time at @entity109 it did n't take long for @entity127 scouts to take notice , either			1
@entity19 and @entity68 were regulars at @entity130 to keep tabs on @entity4			1
however , it was @entity133 who put their money where their mouths were in 2010 , as they saw a bid for @entity4 accepted only for the defender to turn down a move to @entity140			0
two years later , however , @entity4 got his switch to the @entity127 , with newly - promoted @entity22 signing the defender on a four - year deal			2
more performances like tuesday night 's and @entity4 could be on the move again before too long .			1
