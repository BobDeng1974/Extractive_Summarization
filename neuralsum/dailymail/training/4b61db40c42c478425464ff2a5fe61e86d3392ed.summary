a group campaigning for justice for honeymoon murder victim @entity2 is calling for the judge presiding over the @entity10 businessman 's trial to be dismissed over claims she has shown ' bias ' in her handling of the case the judge presiding over the @entity17 murder trial has been accused by an international criminal lawyer of demonstrating ' bias ' and legal ' failures ' in her handling of the case			1
the allegations are said to form part of a dossier prepared by a group campaigning on behalf of @entity2 's dead wife @entity26 that is being delivered to @entity29 's minister of justice , @entity30 can reveal			1
the group , called @entity32 , has compiled a growing petition calling for judge @entity34 - one of the country 's most senior jurists - to be dismissed and @entity2 re-tried fairly			1
the urgent intervention was announced amid predictions the judge appeared increasingly likely to clear the wealthy care home owner of all five charges relating to the murder of his new bride on their honeymoon four years ago			2
campaigners for the group , which is acting independently from mrs @entity2 's family , said they were ' in it for the long haul '			1
a spokesman , who did not wish to be identified as he attends court to report anonymously on behalf of the group , told @entity30 : ' we will continue the campaign and explore all possibilities - further criminal and civil routes are being explored			0
' we have secured the services of an international criminal lawyer			0
it is the judge 's entire demeanour that we believe to show bias – her inappropriate interjections , her disrespectful attitude towards the prosecution and no regard to the victim or her family			1
' the judge , who sits without a jury but with two assessors who have no influence over whether the case should be thrown out at this stage , has also been criticised by the lawyer working for the campaign , who has not been named , for her ' failures and bias ' , the group said			1
the @entity85 family , who relocated to @entity86 to attend the trial , have also indicated that they will brief the media next week ahead of the judge 's ruling on december 8 despite previously saying they would not comment until proceedings had concluded			2
they fear that if the case is dismissed they would never hear @entity2 ’s evidence tested in court			1
but by the end of a highly - charged court session on tuesday , during which the prosecution argued against @entity2 's application to have the case against him thrown out , the grief - stricken family of his dead wife appeared extremely downcast			1
@entity85 ( above ) , mrs @entity2 's uncle , said the family were now ' exploring every option ' available to them as it dawned on them that @entity2 could likely be leaving @entity29 a free man within days @entity2 's father @entity114 arrives at the @entity115 in @entity86 where @entity17 's lawyers have appealed to the judge to dismiss the murder charges against him in stark contrast , @entity2 , his brother , @entity120 and sister @entity121 , appeared more relaxed than at any point since the trial began last month			1
mrs @entity2 was found dead after the taxi she was travelling in with her husband of two weeks was carjacked in a township on the outskirts of @entity86			0
@entity2 and the driver , @entity129 , were freed unharmed , while the 28 - year - old bride was found the following morning with a single gunshot wound to her neck			0
@entity129 later confessed to organising hitmen to kill the @entity135 engineer , but claimed @entity2 offered him money to do so			0
@entity85 , mrs @entity2 's uncle , said the family were now ' exploring every option ' available to them as it dawned on them that @entity2 was likely to be leaving @entity29 a free man within days			1
if the judge does dismiss charges against @entity2 , the state have no leave to appeal the decision			0
according to legal experts , the only viable avenue left to the family would be to consider a civil action so they could hear him give his evidence			0
@entity2 's brother , @entity152 ( above ) , appeared more relaxed than at any point since the trial began when the judge earlier this week said she would consider an application to dismiss the case against the businessman ' the moment we have been waiting for was to hear from @entity5 himself , ' mr @entity85 told @entity30 in a phone call from his home in @entity135			1
' we are still hoping that he will honour that promise – to tell us what happened , to speak the truth , under oath			0
' that 's what all of us who loved @entity26 have been waiting for over the last four years			0
and now it may not happen			0
' it seems increasingly likely that @entity173 will grant the defence 's application to have the case against @entity2 dismissed			2
legal experts have suggested that if the judge was going to rule against @entity2 , and continue with the trial , she would have done so within hours or days			0
the fact that she requested almost two weeks indicates that she requires time to write a lengthy ruling to justify her decision			0
although applications to have charges dismissed – under section 174 of @entity29 's @entity187 - are not unusual , they are rarely granted			0
and since the pursuit of @entity2 by @entity29 's @entity190 has been long , expensive and controversial , the judge will need to show that she has thought long and hard about discharging the charges out even before @entity2 had to launch a defence of them			2
the campaign , which was launched on social media in the weeks after mrs @entity2 's death , has attracted 23,000 followers			2
it has published regular updates of the case against @entity2 , who emerged as a suspect in his wife 's murder soon after he had returned to @entity10 with her remains			2
the self - funded campaign , staffed by anonymous volunteers , has posted legal documents , medical records , cctv stills , photographs and key questions about @entity2 's alleged suspicious comments and behaviour which , they say , he needs to answer before he can ever be free from suspicion			2
since the trial began , the judge 's demeanour towards the state prosecutors and rulings which have dealt major blows to the case against @entity2 , particularly in relation to his sexuality , have attracted widespread comment in the @entity29 media .			1
