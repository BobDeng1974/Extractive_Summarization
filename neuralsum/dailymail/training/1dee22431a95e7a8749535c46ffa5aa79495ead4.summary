by @entity0 published : 17:04 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 23 october 2013 protect your best assets : look after your cleavage and it could stay as perky as @entity5 's earlier this week it was reported that breast tissue ages around three years faster than any other part of the body			1
while there 's not a lot you can do about this internal ageing , there is something you can do about outer signs such as crepey skin , sun spots , sagging and wrinkles			1
so , what are the best ways to halt - or even reverse - these visible signs , and make sure your best assets grow old as gracefully as the rest of you ? would you spend £ 75 on a cleavage facial ? no , this is not a joke : at @entity31 ’s @entity30 ( arkskincare.com ) you can have a @entity32 that combines exfoliation and oils with masks and massage to firm , hydrate and nourish the skin			1
if you would rather pamper yourself in private , you could even invest in 24k gold collagen breast masks ( £ 52 , jamelaskincare.co.uk )			1
they come in a pack of ten and look rather like golden flowers with the centre cut out			1
simply slip them into place and , claim the manufacturers , the combination of gold and plant collagen will help to increase cellular metabolism and tighten the skin , making it feel smoother and firmer			1
cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity53 recommends rather more conventional treatments , but she agrees that the skin of the decollete tends to be mistreated			1
' the skin here is thin , often exposed to sunlight , but frequently forgotten about when it comes to daily protection from uv rays , ' she says			1
' the result is blotchy pigmentation , crepey texture due to loss of elasticity and broken capillaries			1
' smoking can also take its toll on your decolletage , with some experts claiming that you can tell whether a woman is a smoker simply by the wrinkles on her chest			1
dr @entity53 recommends using the same products that you 'd use to rejuvenate your face to anti-age the skin below your neck			1
@entity84 wonders ? collagen breast masks ' i tell my patients they should be applying their skincare right down to their chest - and that means using a broad - spectrum sunscreen every single day , not just on holiday			2
' if the damage is already done , forget cleavage facials and masks , there are three key ingredients you should be keeping an eye out for : ' @entity99 is a fantastic ingredient for the decollete as it builds collagen [ which plumps the skin ] and helps prevent and treat pigmentation , ' says dr @entity53			1
find it in @entity108 's @entity107 ( £ 45 , nubobeauty.com )			2
@entity109 ( or niacinamide ) , as found in dr @entity111 @entity112 ( £ 29.99 , boots.com ) , is also valuable			2
finally , vitamin a ( retinol and retinaldehyde ) will help repair the sun damage			2
but beware , dr @entity53 warns it can be an irritant , so start with a low concentration product such as @entity119 and @entity120 ( £ 15.95 , nurtureskincare.co.uk )			2
the position you sleep in could age your breasts ' your sleeping position can predispose you to wrinkling on the chest , ' says dr @entity53			2
' lying on your side can cause vertical lines in the cleavage , particularly in those who have larger breasts - and if the skin becomes sun - damaged , the creases may become fixed			2
' according to the experts , anything comfortable enough to snooze in is unlikely to be supportive enough to stop gravity taking a visible toll : ' the only bra that we 'd recommend you sleep in would be a soft cup bra , but that would n't separate the breasts , ' says @entity144 of lingerie experts , @entity146			1
sleeping on your back will help to avoid wrinkling the delicate skin between your breasts , but if you find yourself waking up on your side , despite your best efforts , a @entity149 ( £ 29.99 , thekushcompany.com ) might be the answer			2
an anatomically - countoured , non-slip cylinder , it sits between the breasts at night so they stay separated when you 're on your side			2
the idea is that it works like a small cushion , preventing the upper breast from sinking in to the lower breast and stretching the skin with it			0
working along similar lines is the @entity163 ( £ 42.95 , decollette.co.uk ) which looks like no bra you 've ever seen			1
rather than having cups that cover the breasts , it just has a cushioned section that sits in between them			0
research shows that this unconventional underwear could decrease the appearance of ' cleavage crinkle ' after just one night 's use			0
' the problem with breasts is that while they 're subject to the same anti-agers as the rest of your body - such as sunlight and smoking - unlike anywhere else in the body , they are effectively two weights that are supported only by skin , ' says @entity188 of the @entity189			0
gravity can be tough enough on your decolletage when you 're just out and about - research from the @entity194 shows that even when you 're walking , breasts move around up to 33 per cent from their standing position - but when you run , it ’s another story altogether			0
' wearing a specific bra for exercise is crucial , ' says @entity144 of @entity146			1
' breast movement during sporting activity can definitely contribute to loss of tone , sagging and stretch marks			0
but a good sports bra can restrict up to 80 per cent of that movement			1
' although all the exercise in the world wo n't increase your cup size , working the pectoral muscles that support the chest can make things look an awful lot perkier			1
do n't bother with any @entity217 - style arm flinging - instead , try press - ups or , if you 're in the gym , chest presses			0
support : wearing a good sports bra when exercising will prevent breast tissue from stretching and sagging ' women come into my office and tell me that their children have ruined their bodies			1
unfortunately , they ’re right , ' says plastic surgeon @entity230 who is co-author of @entity231			0
' the high levels of oestrogen produced towards the end of pregnancy causes the ligaments to stretch , ' he explains			0
' although they will shrink back , they wo n't go back to where they were before and there 's not much you can do about that - except surgery			0
' you do n't have to go under the scalpel , however			0
there is a wide range of pretty effective options that rely on syringes and lasers to get rid of sagging , wrinkles and age spots			0
' many of the treatments that have been successfully used to rejuvenate the face can also be used effectively on the decollete , ' says @entity258 , editor of consulting room.com , a website that provides independent information about aesthetic treatments			0
' laser treatment ( from £ 100 ) remains a good option for zapping the dark spots that are the legacy of sun worshipping , and chemical peels can also work well			0
' @entity269 ( from about £ 350 ) - also known as @entity270 or @entity271 because it involves drawing blood from the patient , separating out the platelets and reinjecting them into the skin - has become a popular form of skin rejuvenation and has been used successfully on the decollete , as well as the face			0
one of the latest treatments - fat nanografting - involves harvesting fat from the patient , usually from their buttocks or stomach , then breaking it down into tiny particles that can be injected into the face or decollete			0
' it 's not simply about adding volume : when you inject fat , lines are smoothed and you get a glow that was n't there before , ' says plastic surgeon , @entity188			0
' we think that ’s down to the stem cells you find in it - it gives skin its sparkle back			0

@entity32 ' facials ' are available
anti-ageing creams can help
