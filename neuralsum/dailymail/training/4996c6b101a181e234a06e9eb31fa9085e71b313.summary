when i went back to the car to get it , it was gone			2
the memory card was in my purse			1
' devastated mother @entity8 begged thieves to return a memory card containing photos of her deceased infant son @entity25 said losing the images was like losing her son , @entity27 , all over again inside that purse was a memory card containing the pictures she had of her son , @entity32 , who was born on dec. 10 and died on feb. 22 of sudden infant death syndrome			1
those 500 images were the only copies @entity25 had			1
' it 's like i 'm losing him all over again , ' she described the feeling later			0
' i want them back			0
' she and fiance @entity42 , 30 , immediately began taping up fliers around the neighborhood with a picture of @entity27 begging for the return of the memory card			1
@entity25 and fiance @entity42 put notices all over the neighborhood hoping for the image 's safe return ' and then i just lost it			0
i wrote a note with black crayon that said ' keep the tablet and phone but please return the memory card			1
it has pictures of my son			2
he died on february 22			1
he was two and a half months old , ' she told local 21 news			0
she even left her car door unlocked in the hopes that whoever took the purse would return the photos			2
as she waited , her story made the rounds online , being shard more than 500 times on @entity73 to sympathetic readers who wanted to see the photos returned as much as @entity25 did			1
