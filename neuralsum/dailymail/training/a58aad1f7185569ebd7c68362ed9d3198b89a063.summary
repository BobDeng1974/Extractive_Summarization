by @entity0 former referee @entity1 has lifted the lid on sir @entity4 's intimidation tactics			1
and , with figures showing ' @entity7 ' has been slashed since the @entity9 's departure , the official has revealed the pressure referees were under during @entity12 home matches			0
@entity1 recalls one particular episode when @entity12 were chasing the title in 1997 - which they duly won - and welcomed @entity15 to a sodden @entity16			1
raging : sir @entity4 gained a reputation for leaning on referees during his @entity12 reign revealing : @entity20 ( left ) claims @entity4 ( right ) asked him to call a game off as a favour ' it was chucking it down with rain and @entity4 pulled me aside and said “ do me a favour , call the game off ’ , " @entity1 told @entity23			1
' i asked why and he said “ there ’s nowhere else to fit this game in and the @entity31 will have to extend the season			1
we ’ll have a better chance of winning the match and we ’ll win the league at @entity16 ”			0
' at half time @entity12 were losing 3 - 1 and the pitch was like a swimming pool			0
as we came off he said “ i know we ’re 3 - 1 down but please call it off , we could do with a hand here ”			2
' they managed to pull it back to 3 - 3 and in the last minute @entity44 ran into the box and went down in front of the @entity47 and i only gave a goal kick			0
' at full - time @entity4 sprinted across the pitch and shouted at me furiously			1
my wife said , “ @entity4 had a right go at you about that penalty did n’t he ”			1
call it off ? @entity4 wanted the game to be postponed while @entity12 were 3 - 1 down against @entity15 in 1997 one up : @entity56 ( left ) puts @entity15 in the lead but the @entity59 side were unable to win ' i told her he had n’t mentioned the penalty			1
she asked why he came tearing across the pitch at me then			2
the truth is he ran over and asked me if i was going out to dinner that night			2
i said “ no ” and he asked “ why are we leaving so early then ? ”			0
' indeed , @entity4 's ability to squeeze every last second out of officials when his side were losing has since been highlighted			2
with @entity12 trailing at @entity16 under their former boss , an average of 79 seconds extra was played in added time			0
retired : but @entity1 has lifted the lid on @entity4 's hairdryer fury : @entity4 blasts @entity76 during a clash with @entity78 on @entity79 last season however , this compares to just 40 seconds extra under his successor @entity82			1
@entity1 went on to reveal the anxiety caused by not awarding key decisions to @entity12			2
' years and years ago one of the referees had a heart monitor on during a match at @entity16 , ' he explained			0
' they were assessing it and suddenly it jumped and went through the roof			0
they looked at the dvd and he ’d just turned down a penalty in front of the @entity47			0

@entity1 claims sir @entity4 asked him to call game off against @entity15 in 1997
former ref says @entity102 boss wanted *fixture* *replayed* to help with title bid
