the downpours in the @entity6 mean many of the million apple trees planted across the country in the past ten years will be lost			1

warning : a small orchard in @entity18 which was swamped by the flooding event at the beginning of 2014 @entity21 , one of @entity18 's most famous growers , said it was hard to remain upbeat and described his 170 acres as ' @entity24 '			1
' we 've had an appalling late december , january and february - trees over the whole of the @entity29 have taken a hammering , ' @entity21 , from @entity25 , @entity18 , said			1
' there 's certainly a big worry about waterlogged trees - there will be a considerable number dying			2
