by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 19:52 est , 29 december 2012 thousands of the most seriously ill emergency patients are being forced to travel further to hospital in ambulances following a swathe of @entity6 closures and downgrades			1
figures obtained by @entity9 show that the number of patients with life - threatening conditions taking longer than 30 minutes to reach @entity6 has rocketed by an average of 37 per cent in two years			1
most of these people will be transported by ‘ blue light ’ ambulance – so the extra journey time means they are being transported further than ever to access emergency care			0
there has been a huge rise in the number of patients taking 30 minutes or more to get to @entity6			1
patient groups blame cost cutting figures from ambulance trusts across @entity27 show a rise of up to 63 per cent in just two years in the number of priority @entity30 patients spending 30 minutes or more on the road after being collected by paramedics			1
such patients are so ill that trusts have a legal requirement to get paramedics to 95 per cent of cases within eight minutes			2
but there is no upper limit on the time it takes to get them to hospital			0
the shocking rise in journey times has been attributed to the closure and downgrading of @entity6 departments , with some operating limited opening hours			2
but it also shows the effect of the government ’s policy to introduce major trauma networks , which means some of the most seriously ill patients go to specialist centres rather than the closest local casualty department			2
while paramedics are highly trained and can perform life - saving techniques , the disclosure still raises fears that patients are being put at risk by such policies			2
@entity65 , of trade union @entity66 , which represents ambulance workers , said : ‘ alarm bells should be ringing in the government and the @entity70 about this shocking rise in the time it takes seriously ill people to get to hospital			0
concerned : public services trade union @entity66 , pictured here at a previous picket , said ' alarm bells should be ringing ' in the government over the revelations ‘ patients need fast , efficient treatment without having to wait in pain			2
the financial straitjacket on the @entity83 is leading to @entity6 units up and down the country closing or reducing their hours to daytime only			1
the government must see that its policies are damaging the ability of the @entity83 to care properly for patients			1
’ a mail on sunday investigation uncovered 33 hospital emergency departments which have either already been closed or downgraded , or are under threat of closure			0
senior @entity83 executive @entity95 this week warned that the public must accept the closures if the health service is to survive and called on politicians to back the changes			1
but many mps are preparing to join campaigns and protest marches in their constituencies against the unpopular moves			0
doctors are still largely divided on the issue			0
while some claim the changes will improve patient care and mortality rates , others insist it puts patients at risk and dismantles the @entity83			1
shadow health minister @entity116 said : ‘ @entity117 promised to put doctors in control , but he has allowed @entity6 closures to be driven through even where they do n’t have clinical support			1
ministers must take urgent action to ensure patients do n’t pay the price for his broken promises on the @entity83			1
’ this newspaper revealed in september that @entity30 patients in @entity131 , @entity132 – where the @entity6 department closed last year – took an average of 90 minutes to reach an alternative casualty department after the initial 999 call			2
the latest figures , obtained after a @entity139 request , illustrate the national picture for the first time , covering eight out of 11 ambulance trusts in @entity27			0
senior @entity83 executive @entity95 has warned the public must accept cost cutting measures if the service is to survive in the area covered by @entity147 , the number of @entity30 patients taking longer than 30 minutes to reach @entity6 increased by 63 per cent between 2009 - 10 and 2011 - 12 – representing an additional 2,000 patients waiting longer before being seen in hospital			1
the picture was similar in the @entity153 – where @entity6 units in @entity155 and @entity156 have closed in the last few years – with an additional 1,500 patients facing a 30 - minute transit compared with two years ago , a rise of 62 per cent			2
in this area , patients with a certain type of heart attack or suffering major trauma are now taken to specialist units rather than district hospitals			0
in @entity167 , 17,305 seriously ill patients spent 30 minutes in transit compared with just over 11,000 in 2009 – an increase of more than 50 per cent			0
several a&es in @entity167 have closed or have been downgraded and others have limited opening hours			0
the numbers in the area covered by @entity175 represent a rise of 37 per cent in two years , and in the @entity178 there were 23 per cent more journeys taking longer than half an hour in just 12 months			0
in the @entity180 the numbers rose by 27 per cent			0
the exceptions to the national picture were in the @entity183 , where there was a rise of less than one per cent , and in @entity186 , where the number of journeys taking longer than half an hour fell by around a third			0
@entity190 , of campaign group @entity191 , said : ‘ we ’re getting close to crunch time when we find out who was right – the medics who tell people they are more likely to survive if they travel to a specialist unit , or those who said patients would be arriving at @entity6 in a box			1

patient groups up in arms and blame figures on cuts
@entity9 has led campaign to stop @entity6 closures and cost cutting
but @entity83 says patients must accept shut downs to ensure service *'s* survival
