by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:59 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 02:18 est , 5 august 2013 it is no secret that the @entity4 and @entity5 share a love of @entity7 : prince @entity8 first visited the country during his gap year and the couple got engaged on a safari holiday in @entity13			1
so what better gift to mark the birth of their son , @entity17 , than a sterling silver figurine of an @entity7 animal ? the @entity21 has discovered that @entity8 and @entity5 ’s closest friends have bought presents for the baby from upmarket designer @entity25 , who has shops in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
jewel in the crown : the @entity4 and @entity5 have been receiving gifts from friends made by their favourite jeweller animal magic : jeweller @entity25 first started drawing birds of prey after he contracted polio in his native @entity37			1
he later started making jewellery based on his designs			1
left , a meercat , right , a baboon and baby @entity43 has long been a fan of @entity25 – she discovered him when she was designing jewellery at @entity45 and bought £ 70 crocodile stud earrings , £ 150 @entity48 drop earrings and a £ 250 @entity50 elephant pendant – and has taken her mother and sister to the @entity54 shop			1
now she has introduced prince @entity8 and prince @entity55 to the designer , and she and @entity8 are believed to be collecting the firm ’s miniatures to decorate their apartment in @entity60			1
the miniatures range from a £ 110 warthog scratching to an elephant cow and four calves at £ 4,700			1
the @entity65 are in good company – author @entity67 bought a silver @entity69 dodo , inspired by the island of @entity29 , where the extinct birds lived , and prince @entity73 of @entity74 asked @entity25 to customise the gearstick of his @entity77 car with a gold pangolin , which is similar to an anteater			2
little gem : the sterling silver @entity7 animals make the perfect gift for the baby @entity73			1
his parents got engaged during a visit to @entity13 , in the @entity86 of the continent last night @entity25 ’s son @entity88 , 33 , who runs the @entity90 shop , refused to comment on the gifts			0
‘ we are lucky to have some great customers and we are always grateful for the support we have received from them , ’ he said			0
his father was equally reticent about discussing the royal couple			1
‘ i have never been to the homes of the @entity99 so i do n’t know what they have got , ’ he said			0
‘ i think it is remarkable how discreet their friends are			0
’ miniatures : @entity25 's designs range from £ 110 for a warthog to £ 4,700 for an elephant and her calves with his untamed hair , bushy beard and piercing eyes , @entity37 jeweller @entity25 , 60 , is not an obvious figure to be attracting such an elevated clientele			1
but he has gained a cult following among the @entity65			2
he began drawing birds of prey at the age of five in his native @entity120 , in the western province of @entity37 , after he contracted polio and was unable to walk for a year			0
but it was not until later in life that he began making jewellery – he trained as a baker and served as a soldier in the @entity129 wars before making a pair of rosebud earrings out of ivory for his wife @entity133 , 57			2
‘ the local hairdresser liked them so i gave a pair to her and the business grew from there , ’ he laughed			0
he studied lost - wax casting , where a mould is used only once to make the piece original , working in silver			2
his business has been so successful that his four sons have followed him into the profession : @entity88 runs the @entity27 store ; @entity147 , 32 , designs jewellery in @entity29 ; and @entity149 , 28 , and @entity150 , 25 , are based in @entity28			1
‘ i try to take stories from our tribal customs and put them together in such a way that the stories are interesting , ’ @entity25 said			0
‘ if a couple get married , the most appropriate gift to give them would be a @entity159 , a couple of small antelope , who are the closest couple in the animal kingdom			2
‘ but for a couple with a new baby ? i imagine there would be a whole host of animals protective of their babies			2
cult following : @entity25 with his wife wife @entity133 , whom he made his first piece of jewellery for , a pair or rosebud earrings from ivory			1
@entity67 ( right ) is also a fan of his work ' but what i think would be the most appropriate gift would be a young elephant calf walking under the belly of its mother while a bull stands by			0
after all , it could become a herd one day			0
’ the @entity65 couple have received many presents for their son , despite their suggestion that wellwishers give money to charity instead			0
prince @entity196 and the @entity197 bought cashmere blankets , cardigans and hats from @entity203 warrant - holder @entity201 of @entity204			0
@entity206 sent a set of @entity209 books , @entity205 gave an apple tree and @entity211 sent a bag of coffee and a cot cover and sheet embroidered by @entity74 nuns in his wife @entity217 ’s home village			0
@entity220 : no river on the continent is said to be really wild unless it is inhabited by crocodiles , the most successful ancestor of the dinosaurs			0
this silver specimen would set you back £ 3,200			2

*unusual* @entity7 animal jewellery is a big hit with the royal couple
the designs , made of sterling silver , cost up to £ 4,700 *apiece*
@entity8 and @entity5 are decorating @entity60 with the *delicate* items
the *eccentric* designer behind the craft has built up a cult following
