‘ i now say that @entity6 and dr @entity69 saved my life			1
’ mrs @entity1 , 47 , had ignored her symptoms for months until she watched the @entity79 show that morning last autumn , in which @entity6 , 53 - who has long supported cancer charities - urged viewers to check themselves for abnormalities			1
as part of a ‘ breast awareness week ’ , the show discussed hidden symptoms - such as women suddenly developing an inverted nipple , dimpling around the nipple and unusual pain in the breasts or armpits			1

‘ at that time they were doing a breast awareness week and dr @entity69 was being interviewed and explained the symptoms and warning signs			1
‘ i knew myself there was something wrong but had tried to ignore it up until that point - i did n’t have any lumps so i thought it could n’t be cancer			0
‘ but they started talking about three different symptoms and i realised that i ticked two on the list			2
’ she added ‘ @entity6 and dr @entity69 gave me the nudge i needed			1
i said to my husband : “ i need to get this looked at ”			0

mrs @entity1 is going to appear on @entity6 next week to thank the presenter and dr @entity69 for saving her life ‘ luckily my body responded really well to the treatment and i only had to have a lumpectomy rather than a breast removal which was a huge relief			1
