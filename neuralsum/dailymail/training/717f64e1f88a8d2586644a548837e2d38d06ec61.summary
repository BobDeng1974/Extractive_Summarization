@entity2 sheriff 's deputies checking on @entity3 weeks before he killed six college students were aware of but did n't view disturbing videos that prompted calls about his well - being			1
the sheriff 's office says thursday that four deputies , a police officer and a dispatcher in training were sent to @entity3 's apartment april 30 after being informed by the county 's mental health hotline that @entity3 's therapist and mother were concerned about videos he posted online			1
they questioned him for 10 minutes and then briefed @entity3 's mother by telephone before having him speak to her directly			1
he told them he was having trouble fitting in socially in @entity32 and the videos were a way to express himself			0
he reposted some of the videos before friday 's rampage			2
on monday , sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity38 declined to discuss that visit in greater detail , pending an internal investigation , but said that deputies in general were barred from entering a residence without a warrant			1
' an exception would be if deputies felt that a person was a harm to themselves or others or there was an immediate threat , ' @entity46 said			2
' in this case , we would have had to determine that @entity3 or his roommates were in immediate danger			2
' @entity3 wrote in his manifesto that he manipulated the officers to get them out of his hair			1
@entity3 killed six and injured 13 in his friday rampage			2
above , his @entity62 pictured at the crime scene ' i tactfully told them that it was all a misunderstanding , and they finally left			0
if they had demanded to search my room â€¦ that would have ended everything , ' he said in his manifesto			0
authorities say @entity3 fatally stabbed three roommates in his apartment before shooting three students to death near the @entity78 at @entity2			1
the two women and four men who were killed were aged 19 to 22 and students at the school			0
thirteen people were wounded , including eight shot by @entity3 as he sped through town in his black @entity62 , exchanging fire with police , authorities said			2
' he was just very quiet ' officers found @entity3 dead in his car with three legally purchased pistols and more than 400 rounds of ammunition			1
@entity93 , who lived in the same building as @entity3 and knew him before the attacks , told @entity96 in an interview that the videos that had concerned his mother should have been red flags for the sheriff 's department			1
sheriff @entity103 has ordered an internal investigation of how his deputies handled their interaction with @entity3 ' when it got to the point that the parents called the police , it makes me wonder if the police even looked at the videos , ' @entity93 , 22 , said			1
his suspicions turned out to be correct			0
' if they 'd looked at the videos , they could 've done some sort of court order to do a search warrant			0
' but the young man conceded that deputies would have needed legal grounds to search @entity3 or his home and may not have found that justification during their visit to his apartment			1
' when you looked at him , there was no reason to get concerned			0
he did n't seem like a threatening or intimidating guy			0
he was just very quiet , ' @entity93 said			0
@entity132 , a former deputy chief of police in @entity133 , @entity134 , said the deputies could have obtained a warrant if the video explicitly threatened violence			0
' if the caller said they feared he was going to harm somebody or himself based upon @entity144 postings , i would say the deputies did not go far enough in their investigation , ' @entity132 said			0
he said that deputies could also have run @entity3 through their system to learn he had guns registered in his name .			2
