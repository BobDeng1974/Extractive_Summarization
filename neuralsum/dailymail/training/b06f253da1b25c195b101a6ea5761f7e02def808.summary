during january and february , a geomagnetic storm hit parts of the @entity2 and treated residents to a rare and extremely beautiful @entity5 light display			1
a photographer from @entity7 took to the hills and lakes of @entity10 to capture more than 2,000 pictures of this event - usually only seen in more northern regions - and created a stunning time - lapse video being hailed as evidence of the best @entity5 display the @entity2 has seen for over 12 years			1
@entity17 photographer @entity16 spent days putting together the video , which he says was the highest point in this solar maximum cycle			1
this time - lapse video of the @entity5 as they travelled over @entity7 in february , video grab pictured , was created using more than 2,000 pictures			1
it is being hailed as evidence of the best @entity5 display the @entity2 has seen for more than 12 years there are two types of @entity27 - @entity5 , which means ‘ dawn of the north ’ , and @entity30 ’ , known as ‘ dawn of the south			1
’ they are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the @entity37 ’s atmosphere			1
these so - called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the @entity37 ’s magnetic field			1
usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the @entity37 ’s magnetic field , but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles			1
as a result , @entity27 is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution			2
over the course of january and february , this geomagnetic storm and shock wave from the solar wind was so strong and significant , it travelled further south over the @entity2 and could be seen in areas with little cloud cover			1
auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common			0
shades of red , yellow , green , blue , and violet have also been reported			0
the common , greenish - yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles ( 96km ) above @entity37			1
rare , red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up , at around 200 miles ( 321km )			0
nitrogen produces blue or purplish - red aurora			0
a cycle is 11 years of the of the sun 's activity , which creates the dancing colours that were observed by lucky @entity2 as far south as @entity78 a fortnight ago			2
@entity16 said : ' it was for sure the best light show in this solar cycle , even this millennium			2
i 've never seen anything quite as spectacular			0
' due to the fact there is less light pollution in @entity7 , the breathtaking sight could be witnessed in all its glory			2
' @entity16 focused on landmarks , cliffs and castles in @entity10 while tracking the wild night sky overhead			2
the 41 - year - old astronomy enthusiast only took up photography two years ago , after years of putting his passion to one side			0
since then he has quickly become one of the country 's highest regarded time - lapse photographers			1
while these shots were taken in the @entity102 's @entity101 of @entity10 , @entity16 has also photographed other locations in @entity7 , including 4,000 year - old tombs near @entity105 , @entity106 more and @entity107			1
@entity16 said : ' i came to @entity10 because of a job			2
i had no idea the area would be a place where i could witness such events			0
it is the perfect place and has allowed me to revive my hobby			0
' the main theme of the video is to show the beauty of the night sky and remind people what they are missing by staying at home and watching tv			0
' i wanted to squeeze in as many aurora shots as possible as these are often colourful displays , which appeal to people and grab their attention			0
' @entity128 , director of the @entity27 section of the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) , added : ' @entity16 's video is of such great quality it can be scientifically analysed and will be used as evidence to show the peak of this solar maximum cycle			1
' there is normally one peak to a solar cycle , where we see the strongest aurora			0
we believed it to be in 2008 however the display witnessed a fortnight ago was stronger leading us to believe this cycle had two peaks and is now in decline			0
' in the video you can see rare sub storms , which is a sudden connection of the sun and the earth 's magnetic fields which allow the charged particles to flow to the polar regions			1
' @entity17 photographer @entity16 focused on landmarks , cliffs and castles in @entity10 , including the @entity159 pictured , for his video , while tracking the night sky overhead			1

the video , grab pictured , was posted to @entity176 this week and has quickly gained more than 15,000 views from stargazers around the world the video was posted to @entity176 this week and has quickly gained over 15,000 views from stargazers around the world			0

@entity5 was *visible* over the @entity2 due to a geomagnetic storm that occurred above the country in february
@entity17 photographer @entity16 , from @entity10 in @entity7 created the time - lapse using 2,000 photos
@entity27 is caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the @entity37 ’s atmosphere
these so - called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind field hits the @entity37 ’s magnetic field
the charged particles collide with gas molecules and these collisions emit variations of light
