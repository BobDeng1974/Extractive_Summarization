@entity0 and @entity1 have been using a legal but dodgy tax loophole to evade the so - called ' death tax ' that they both worked to raise , according to news reports published on tuesday			1
despite @entity1 's frequent insistence that she has middle - class roots and identifies with ordinary @entity11 , she and her husband the former president have amassed a fortune likely valued in the tens of millions of dollars			1
in order to shield that wealth from the federal government 's rapacious tax collectors at the @entity19 , they are using a financial planning strategy to shift ownership of their houses to a private trust , and then to their daughter @entity27			1
this leaves the power couple free to reap the tax advantage of making such a generous gift before they die , while they rent the property back from her at a bargain price			2
it will also exclude most of the homes ' values from the @entity19 's calculation that will determine how much of their estates is taxable			1
@entity67 examined the @entity69 ' financial disclosure statements and reported tuesday that the couple made the move in 2010			1
in their political lives , both @entity69 have advocated for narrowing the loophole that they are now leveraging			0
in august 2000 , shortly before he left office , @entity75 vetoed a congressional bill that would have eliminated the estate tax			1
he insisted that @entity79 should ' proceed on grounds of fiscal responsibility and fairness ' instead			0
@entity1 has been more direct , arguing during the 2008 presidential campaign season for a change in federal law that would expose more of wealthy @entity11 ' estates to the tax man			2
@entity89 's @entity88 rapped the quasi-populist @entity69 on tuesday â€“ not for dodging taxes , but for being tone deaf to the image it projects to ordinary @entity11			2
' voters may have a problem with a potential presidential candidate who spends a lot of time talking about the problems of the middle class while hobnobbing with the " rich and privileged " , ' @entity88 said			0
' it 's part of a larger problem that i think she has			0
... i do n't think there 's any ethical problem here			0
i think the optics are terrible , though			0
' ' i think once you put that together with @entity1 giving speeches for $ 200,000 to @entity110 , people start to say , " wait a minute : is she one of us or not ? " ' beneficiary : @entity113 and her children will become ultra-wealthy and pay little in estate tax when her parents are deceased , thanks to a loophole that @entity0 and @entity1 fought to eliminate man of the people : former president @entity75 and his wife are worth between $ 5 and $ 50 million -- the exact amount is unclear because the federal government allows politicians to disclose their finances in broad ranges of dollar amounts federal estate taxes currently apply only to amounts over $ 5.34 million			1
mrs. @entity1 proposed lowering that cap to $ 3.5 million			2
she also argued that the top tax rate , paid only by the super-wealthy , should increase from 40 to 45 per cent			0
president @entity133 has acquiesced to @entity79 , however , increasing the exemption amount to its current level and leaving rates alone			0
@entity1 's 2007 position , that a high estate tax keeps @entity11 from becoming ' dominated by inherited wealth , ' is ringing hollow in 2014 , however			1
after a guffaw - inducing gaffe in which she claimed she and president @entity75 were ' dead broke ' when they left the @entity143 , her finances have been thrust into the national spotlight			2
they both have raked in $ 200,000 or more per paid speech , and @entity1 received a reported $ 14 million book - advance deal for her recent tome ' @entity41 , ' which has sold poorly			1
the power couple have a net worth between $ 5 and $ 50 million			0
the exact amount is unclear because the federal government allows politicians to disclose their finances in broad ranges of dollar amounts			0
the @entity157 is running a 30 - second ad tuesday on @entity159 during a broadcast town hall with @entity1			1
the ad focuses on her wealth .			0

the @entity75 employed a common tax - avoidance strategy in 2010 to shield their homes from the @entity19 when they die
shifting ownership of real estate to ' residence trusts ' excludes them from the calculations that determine how much estate tax @entity27 must pay
@entity1 and @entity0 have both argued for higher estate taxes , and fought @entity157 ' attempts to eliminate entirely what they call the ' death tax '
a @entity67 commentator said tuesday that the move is legal and passes the ethics smell - test , but will be terrible optics for @entity1 in 2016
she and @entity0 , the former president , rake in $ 200,000 or more for every public speech they give
