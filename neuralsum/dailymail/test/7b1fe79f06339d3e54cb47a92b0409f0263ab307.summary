’ @entity0 hits a tee shot on the fourth hole during the second day of the masters on friday meth on the rise headline writers everywhere will be keeping fingers crossed that golf continues to prove an addiction for the highly rated @entity21 champion @entity20 , who opened with a 74 on his @entity23 debut			1
