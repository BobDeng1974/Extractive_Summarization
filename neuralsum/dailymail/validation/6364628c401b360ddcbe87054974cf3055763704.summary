they are known as some of nature 's most reclusive predators , and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the @entity9			1
peeking out from behind a tree , the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer @entity13 as he tried to capture it on film			1
the amusing game of @entity17 took place in @entity19 , a small village in the country 's hilly east , while the seven - year - old male owl was out hunting			2
surprise : a great grey owl pokes it head out from behind a tree as @entity13 , 34 , a senior engineer and photographer , captures the bird of prey on film playing games : mr @entity13 , who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one , said he was n't sure what the bird was doing , but it appeared to be playing a game with him mr @entity13 , 34 , of @entity37 , @entity9 , said : ' i was n't sure what this mischievous owl was doing , however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me			1

now you see me : the great grey owl is the largest species of owl , measuring up to two and a half feet in length			1
despite the animal 's reputation for being nocturnal , this species often hunts during the day youngster : mr @entity13 believes the owl was a male , and was around seven years old , making it relatively young			2
captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old their large face , and two disc - shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes , act as satellite dishes , filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers			0
their hearing is so acute that , during the winter months , the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts , listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath			2
their large , soft feathers and slow , deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move , so as not to scare their prey away			0
once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow , they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out			0
while the birds are not migratory , they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce .			0
