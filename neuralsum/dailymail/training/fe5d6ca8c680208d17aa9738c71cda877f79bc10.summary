by @entity0 for @entity1 scientists have been left shocked by the surprising appearance of hundreds of methane vents off the @entity6 @entity5			1
more than 500 vents have been found where methane is seeping into the ocean			1
and there is concern that these increased amounts of gas could be caused by global warming			1
a large number of methane vents have been found off the @entity6 @entity5			1
the findings suggest such leakage is far more widespread in the @entity20 than thought			1
here methane is seen streaming from the seafloor at a depth of about 1,400 feet ( 425 metres ) offshore from @entity25 the study published in @entity27 was carried out by researchers from @entity29 , the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and other institutions			0
a cold seep or cold vent is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulphide , methane and other hydrocarbon - rich fluid seepage occurs			1
despite the term , the temperature of a seepage is not lower than surrounding sea water - in many cases the temperature is slightly higher			2
cold seeps develop over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity			0
oil and methane seep out of those fissures and emerge over an area several hundred metres wide			2
entire ecosystems can develop around the unique make - up of a cold seep			0
the research suggests that natural methane leakage from the seafloor is far more widespread in the @entity6 @entity20 than previously thought			1
in total more than 570 seafloor cold seeps were observed between @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , @entity63			0
cold seeps are areas where gases and fluids leak into the surrounding water from sediments on the seafloor			0
the seeps were found on the outer continental shelf and the continental slope of the eastern @entity6			1
previously , only three seep areas had been identified in this area - making the findings a dramatic increase on what was known before			2
‘ widespread seepage had not been expected on the @entity20 margin , ’ said @entity78 , the study ’s lead author and a professor at @entity29			1
‘ it is not near a plate tectonic boundary like the @entity6 @entity86 coast , nor associated with a petroleum basin like the northern @entity88			0
’ in total more than 570 seafloor cold seeps were seen between @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , @entity63 ( shown in this map )			0
the study , published in @entity91 , was carried out by researchers from @entity29 , the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and other institutions the seeps were found on the outer continental shelf and the continental slope of the eastern @entity6 ( illustration shown )			2
previously , only three seep areas had been identified in this area - making the findings a dramatic increase on what was known before the location of the seeps and knowledge of the underlying geology suggests the leaking methane is being produced by microbial processes in shallow sediments			1
at depths of more than 2,000 feet ( 600 metres ) in some places , the seeps are too deep to release methane directly into the atmosphere			0
however , there is the danger that if the methane stays in the water , it could oxidise into carbon dioxide			0
this can increase the acidity of ocean waters and reduce oxygen levels , which can be harmful to marine life			2
while not directly pointing a finger at climate change , the researchers indicate that global warming could be the cause of the problem			1
‘ warming of ocean temperatures on seasonal , decadal or much longer time scales can cause gas hydrate to release its methane , which may then be emitted at seep sites , ’ said dr @entity127 , study co-author and chief of the @entity129			2
‘ such continental slope seeps have previously been recognised in the @entity137 , but not at mid-latitudes			0
so this is a first			0
’ in this image push cores are used to collect samples of the sediment found near a seep site , allowing investigation into the biological , chemical and physical make up of the bottom during the @entity148 , from which some of the findings were made			0

a large number of methane vents have been found off the @entity6 @entity5
suggests such leakage is far more widespread in the @entity20 than thought
previously only three seepage areas had been known of in this area
increased levels of methane can make water more acidic and *deadly* to life
the vents could be caused by a warming ocean linked to climate change
