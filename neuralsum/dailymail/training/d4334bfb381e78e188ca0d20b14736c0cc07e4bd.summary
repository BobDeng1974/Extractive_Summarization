by @entity0 for @entity1 an @entity3 radical has branded @entity5 authorities ' the real terrorists ' , accusing them of plotting to destroy the religion , while an outspoken @entity9 firebrand declared today 's anti-terror raids were a ' bogus ' stunt to justify new terror laws			1
off the back of the largest terror raids in the nation 's history , controversial @entity14 preacher @entity13 wrote on @entity19 : ' the @entity20 with its authorities are clearly attacking islam and muslims ! ! ( sic ) '			1
he said the @entity5 government wants to ' destroy @entity3 by any means ... closing down @entity3 centres , raiding @entity28 houses , arresting active @entity28 youth and preachers , intimidating @entity28 cancelling their passports ... and creating a vibe of fear within the @entity5 community to make them afraid of @entity28 '			1
at the same time , in remarks labelled ' inflammatory ' by one moderate @entity28 leader , @entity37 , the spokesman for the @entity39 group , said the mass police raids in @entity41 and @entity42 were ' just in time to justify the bogus terror threat level rise '			1
as members of the @entity3 community organised a protest in @entity42 tonight claiming brutality against @entity28 , community leader dr @entity44 issued a call for calm , asking members of the community , politicians and the media ' not to inflame the situation by throwing oil in the fire '			1
remarks : mr @entity37 made his statement after news of the terror raids this morning			1
@entity68 released these images of arrests that were made in @entity42 this morning			0
fifteen people were detained in @entity72			1
come with us : this arrest , from today 's raid , was made in @entity76 , south of @entity41			0
mr @entity37 ( pictured ) made the remarks on his @entity19 page this morning			2
dr @entity44 , who hosted a succesful ' muslims for @entity5 ' barbeque , at the weekend , said : ' we all have to invest together fighting anyone who is going to affect the safety and security of all @entity5			2
' both @entity13 and @entity37 today linked the raids to the @entity88 government 's proposed terror laws			1
@entity13 said the government would use ' the excuse of " terrorism " to launch a crazy indiscriminating assault against harmless youth who have done nothing wrong '			0
@entity37 said : ' as last as last week the @entity96 and @entity97 head were telling us that there was no intelligence of any plans for attacks in @entity5 '			1
' few days later we wake up to yet more dawn " terror " raids with hundreds of police raiding @entity28 homes in @entity42 and @entity41			1
' ' just in time to justify the bogus terror threat level rise and the ' anti-terror ' laws which will be tabled to @entity110 next week			2
' ' once again , we wake up to the sad news of our innocent @entity28 brothers being arrested by the @entity5 authorities , their families being terrorized , their houses being raided , their freedoms being confiscated , their rights abused ... this is becoming more than what a sane person can bare			1
' ' the @entity5 government want to destroy @entity3 by any means , and they know that they ca n't do so by attacking it directly , so they resort to closing down @entity3 centres , raiding @entity28 houses , arresting active @entity28 youth and preachers , intimidating @entity28 , cancelling their passports , restricting their freedom , enforcing policies that aim to dividing the @entity28 community , and creating a vibe of fear within the @entity5 community to make them afraid of @entity28 , and therefore , they will face no opposition when it comes to passing these new terror laws or arresting innocent @entity28 ... ' the @entity5 government is practising institutional terrorism			1
its authorities are the real terrorists			1
' we ask @entity144 to destroy those who plot against us , and to keep their harm away from us			0
@entity144 look after your obedient servants and protect them from the harm of this government			0
@entity144 this government and its authorities have felt safe from your punishment and therefore unleashed their wrath against the innocent harmless @entity28 , @entity152 so please deal with them according to your justice , and substitute them with others who are less harmful to your religion and its followers			2
' he continued by saying it was the ' same thing ( former prime minister ) @entity165 did ' in 2005 when terror raids also took place			1
nine men were arrested as part of @entity170 in 2005 , which found @entity5 jihadist cells were amassing equipment to use in a terrorist attack on @entity5			2
muslim leader dr @entity44 told @entity1 those remarks were ' inflammatory ' and ' totally premature ' given those arrested have not faced court			0
dr @entity44 said : ' @entity180 terror raids are really serious matters , and i believe in the professionalism of our security agencies			2
' such a raid should n't be taken lightly and i have no doubt that if there is n't enough sufficient evidence , arrest warrants would not be given for such raids			0
' he said those arrested were entitled to the presumption of innocence and a fair hearing in a court of law			0
' any arrest will be tested in the court of law and we have full confidence in the judiciary systems			0
' ' we are lucky to be living in the country where the judicial arm will not be influenced by the executive arm of the government - and we ( should ) just have to wait before making such inflammatory remarks			0
' @entity37 said in his post that it would be a ' tough week ' for the @entity211 but agreed that the presumption of innocence needed to be upheld			0
' it 's the government that needs to be interrogated here to prove its claims , not those being made examples of , ' he said			0
he issued a follow up statement this morning labelling the timing of the raids as ' suspect '			0
' the timing of these raids is suspect indeed			0
with the " anti-terror " laws , which hit a wall in the community , to be tabled to @entity110 next week and with " military intervention " imminent in @entity230 , these raids are very timely for the government and its propaganda campaign for the same			0
' today 's raids , which occurred at dawn in suburbs in @entity42 and @entity41 , involved 800 police in @entity72 alone			2
prime minister @entity237 and outgoing @entity97 chief @entity238 announced @entity5 's terror alert level would be raised to ' high ' - meaning an attack is likely - last friday			2
