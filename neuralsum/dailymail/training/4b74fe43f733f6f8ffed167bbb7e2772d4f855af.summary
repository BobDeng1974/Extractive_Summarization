by @entity0 for the @entity1 ' unpredictable threats ' : defence secretary @entity3 urged increased defence spending to ward off countries like @entity6 @entity7 is under pressure to extend a commitment to spend at least 2 per cent of national income on defence as it demands @entity13 allies boost their investment			1
defence secretary @entity3 said every member should increase military spending to deal with ‘ unpredictable and uncertain threats ’ , particularly from @entity6			1
the prime minister said @entity7 was showing leadership by being one of only four of the 28 @entity13 states to meet the alliance ’s spending target			1
but critics , including senior @entity25 , pointed out that the government has only pledged to maintain that level until the current spending round ends in april 2016			0
pressure is growing on @entity30 to enshrine the commitment in legislation for good			0
@entity7 and the @entity33 will also use the @entity13 summit in @entity35 to push for a new rapid response force comprising of between 3,000 and 5,000 international troops , which could be deployed within two days if member states face military aggression			1
the organisation is proposing to beef up its presence in eastern @entity43 following @entity45 ’s annexation of @entity46 and attempts to destabilise more of @entity48			0
it is also proposing military exercises alongside @entity48 forces as a warning to @entity53			0
@entity54 was last night shamed into cancelling plans to sell a multi-billion pound warship to @entity6 following protests from the @entity33 and the @entity7			1
mr @entity3 insisted @entity13 must ‘ toughen up ’ to deal with the new threats facing the @entity59			1
he said the alliance must sharpen its activities to contend with crises , including ‘ almost daily atrocities ’ in the @entity64			0
the defence secretary said the @entity59 could either ‘ enfeeble ’ the transatlantic alliance by allowing defence spending to fall , or ‘ revive its spirit ’ by boosting investment			2
‘ let me be very clear about the @entity7 ’s position , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s time now to toughen up so that @entity13 can deal with the aggression and the threats that we face			2
commitment : mr @entity3 spoke out ahead of a meeting of @entity13 powers in @entity79 , @entity35 ( pictured ) ‘ that means rapid reaction forces that are worthy of the name , that means better sharing of capability , and it means the first ever public commitment to increase defence spending			1
‘ that will demonstrate to all those who threaten us that the state of our transatlantic bond is strong			0
‘ @entity13 was formed on the basis that @entity43 would pay her way			2
‘ like any insurance policy , defence only pays out when you pay in			0
’ colonel @entity99 , a @entity99 mp who was the commander of @entity13 forces in @entity101 , said mr @entity30 should put the two per cent spending commitment into law - rather than a separate pledge to legislate for 0.7 per cent of national income going on foreign aid			2
increased presence : @entity13 is planning to beef up its forces in war - torn @entity48 @entity111 mp @entity110 added : ‘ it ’s typical of the @entity25 that they are lecturing our @entity43 partners about defence when they wo n’t commit to adequately funding our troops beyond the next financial year			1
‘ @entity3 should be getting his own house in order before trying to tell voters what to do			0
’ the government will seek to demonstrate its commitment to defence spending by unveiling a £ 3.5billion deal for nearly 600 new armoured vehicles , the @entity130 ’s largest single order for armoured vehicles for more than 30 years			0
mr @entity30 said the @entity7 had the second largest defence budget in @entity13 and was providing ‘ leadership ’ on spending within the alliance			1
other countries , including @entity136 , have fiercely resisted calls to increase defence spending above two per cent of gdp .			0

defence secretary @entity3 said @entity13 members should increase funds
extra cash could be used to combat ' unpredictable ' threats - like @entity6
@entity7 and the @entity33 will use @entity13 meeting in @entity35 to push for new troops
