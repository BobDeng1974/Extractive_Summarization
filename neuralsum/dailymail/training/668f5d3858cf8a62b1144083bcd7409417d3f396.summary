by @entity0 published : 04:13 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 07:30 est , 19 october 2012 the ' @entity2 ' sessions have been added to the timetable at a @entity5 fitness studio , alongside ' @entity6 ' and ' babes on @entity9 ' classes			1
instructor @entity10 has insisted the classes are focused on fitness and that children are not taught any ' sexual moves ' , but a child psychologist has warned that parents should be conscious of pole dancing 's association with stripping and the sex industry			1
girls and boys aged between five and 12 have already been enrolled in the controversial classes at the @entity24 and fitness studio in @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity27 , a certified fitness and aerobics instructor , said she introduced the classes in response to demand from her adult clients			1
' my existing students were asking about it for their children , ' she told the @entity37			0
' they were saying : " my daughter plays on my pole at home all the time			0
i 'd love her to actually learn how to do things properly and not hurt herself			0
" ' they have no association with it or think there is anything wrong or bad about it			0
that 's an adult putting that on them , ' she said			0
the instructor said the classes were focused on the gymnastic and circus acrobatic elements of pole dancing , and that girls and boys attending the sessions were not taught ' adult ' moves			2
' i treat it just like gymnastic classes , ' she said , adding : ' this is strictly about fitness			2
' but child psychologist @entity62 told @entity63 he feared introducing young girls to pole dancing could make them more likely to join the sex industry in later life			1
' there would be that potential and that is something of concern because we know that people in the adult industry are out recruiting in colleges and universities , as well as attempting to recruit in high schools			0
' that temptation would certainly be there , and for someone who already has those skills it would be an easy transition , ' he said			1
a fitness studio in @entity82 provoked an outcry last year after introducing pole dancing lessons for children and then posting pictures of the classes on @entity88			2
parents and councillors who deemed the junior sessions at @entity92 inappropriate raised concerns over the images being published online , with one mother claiming it would encourage child grooming			0
but instructor @entity98 said photographs were only put on the website with parents ' consent , and that there was ' nothing inappropriate ' about the pole dancing classes .			2
