by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 03:11 est , 14 august 2012 if they awarded @entity4 golds for ‘ heaviest bags under the eyes ’ , there would have been many contenders			1
but aside from trying to stay awake after the greatest time of their lives , the international athletes heading home from @entity10 yesterday faced few of the wearisome obstacles found in airports			1
granted , some 6ft 8in - plus members of @entity19 ’s men ’s volleyball team were forced to stoop their way through the scanners ; and those proudly wearing their medals were politely asked to take them off and place them in the plastic trays along with the rest of their belongings to be security checked			2
home time : members of the @entity33 arrive with their luggage at @entity10 in @entity35 - ready to fly home at the end of the @entity4 smile ! : @entity40 's @entity39 , left , pictured with a team mate and @entity43 boxing coach @entity42 , right , pose up for photos at the @entity45 at @entity10 before heading home @entity46 send off : athletes and coaches from @entity40 in the @entity49 , complete with fake grass and deer , at @entity10 but otherwise , the temporary @entity45 ( basically a huge tent the size of three @entity4 swimming pools ) meant it was a day for ‘ personal bests ’ all round in the departure dash			1
and there was no need to test your endurance in that traditional @entity63 event – the marathon queue			0
for the athletes , leaving @entity35 was a walk in the park ( almost literally , given the terminal ’s decor )			1
if anyone ’s spirits did flag , there were guardsmen in bearskins ever ready to lift them again			0
‘ hello , @entity81 ! ’ bellowed one from a sentry box , as some of that country ’s divers strolled in			0
cue plenty of photos for the scrapbook as they each posed with the ‘ soldier ’ ( actually , like the others , an actor )			0
onward to security , where the conveyor belts through the scanners were decorated to look like brick walls and adorned with iconic @entity35 street signs			0
farewell : a specially - constructed @entity4 terminal at @entity10 was in full operation today a lot of kit to carry : @entity4 athletes departed from a specially built terminal at @entity10 to help cope during the busy period a job well done : @entity101 volunteers walk out of the departure lounge at @entity10 's @entity103 after seeing off athletes and @entity4 officials faux neo-classical columns arched the athletes ’ route through to an astro - turfed lounge decked out to look like a park ( complete with more staff dressed as park wardens )			1
no need , of course , for 4ft 11in @entity114 , from @entity81 ’s 3m springboard diving team , to duck			0
then off she went for more photos , this time with another two ‘ guardsmen ’ who were pretending to ride on two model stags			0
‘ they are so cute , ’ said the 22 - year - old			2
‘ the @entity4 here has been so fine			1
' i did n’t make it into the semi-finals but i had a great time , walking around @entity35 and shopping			2
i bought all sorts of souvenirs			0
’ new look : athletes began to arrive to leave @entity35 at the temporary @entity45 at @entity10 is that an airport ? to see the athletes off from @entity10 , the airport set up a make - shift @entity4 terminal memories : a member of the @entity143 contingent takes a picture of a tree with @entity4 moments hung on its branches nearby , a couple of @entity150 athletes were delighted by the near life - size cardboard cutout of the back of a double - decker @entity153 ( @entity155 : 2012 ; destination : @entity35 ) and snapped away on their cameras as they took it in turns to pretend boarding it			1
in here , you rub shoulders with champions too			0
yesterday , @entity167 ’s gold medal - winning boxer @entity165 was boarding a flight back to @entity169			1
the softly spoken 26 - year - old she was looking forward to going home after the ‘ most incredible two weeks of my life ’			1
‘ it ’s going to be a bit mad , so i ’m a bit nervous , ’ she said at the prospect of the almighty craic set to erupt on her return to the @entity167 , adding with a smile : ‘ i ’m quite gentle out of the ring			2
’ time to go : the @entity19 rhythmic gymnastics team arrived in @entity10 before they left the capital @entity184 arrived at @entity10 ( left ) while @entity186 's @entity185 waved the flag at @entity188 relaxing : @entity184 reclines as he waits for his flight back to the @entity190 procession : actors lead a member of the @entity195 team through @entity10 kicking back : @entity190 swimmer @entity196 tweeted : ' it 's been fun @entity35 but now it 's time to get back to the good ole @entity190 -- lunch anyone ? ? ' she could not wait to see her family , especially her grandmother @entity204 , who has just turned 80			1
‘ she ’s always been supportive of me and has been living for this moment , ’ @entity165 said			0
‘ it ’s been an incredible games and i have been privileged to be part of it			2
’ the feel - good factor was everywhere			2
@entity210 , 23 , of the @entity190 ’s gold medal - winning water polo team , said : ‘ @entity213 were awesome			2
the people were so good to us			0
finally home : @entity167 's @entity218 winners , from left to right , @entity219 , @entity221 @entity220 , @entity222 and @entity165 arrive with the rest of the @entity167 team at @entity225 , left , and @entity167 boxer @entity165 holding her olympic gold medal with a flag out of the cockpit of the plane , right @entity231 judo bronze medalist @entity230 at @entity188 in @entity35 ready to jump on the @entity233 home waiting game : @entity43 's @entity235 , gold medal winner in the men 's discus , waits for his baggage at @entity10 after his plane was canceled due to a technical failure farewell @entity35 ! the @entity243 team gathered at @entity188 as they waited for the @entity233 out on a high : members of the @entity243 ' women 's hockey team brandished their gold medals at @entity188 before they departed how many ? @entity249 shows her two gold and one silver swimming medals one last time in the @entity63 ' all the volunteers were so friendly and gave us a lot of support			1
i have to say to @entity63 – you guys did a great job			0
’ @entity19 ’s @entity260 , 27 , who won gold in the 800m , said : ‘ it ’s the best @entity4 , i like @entity35			2
yesterday i went to @entity263 – so beautiful			0
’ not so upbeat ? members of the @entity186 team seemed to be sleeping off the closing ceremony at @entity188 busy day : more than 100,000 people are attempting to leave the capital today join the queue : passengers wait in line to catch the @entity233 as the exodus begins that 's more like it ! @entity186 athletes got in the spirit of things at @entity188 before departing there were long queues at @entity188 for the @entity233 , but the @entity243 team ( right ) did n't seem to mind too much about 6,000 athletes and a further 9,000 @entity4 coaches and officials were expected through the @entity4 terminal yesterday , its busiest day			1
it will also be in use today and tomorrow			0
no aircraft depart from it			0
instead athletes take an airside coach to their final departure point where they can mingle with regular passengers as they wait for their flight			0
the athletes are then clapped into each terminal by a ‘ guard of honour ’ of @entity10 volunteers to wish them luck in their future sporting endeavours in one last golden goodbye from @entity35			1
golden girl : @entity167 @entity302 medallist @entity165 seemed to be enjoying the new terminal magical moment : @entity165 's father , @entity305 , left a touching message in the @entity4 terminal before flying back to @entity167 long time ago : it has been just three weeks since thousands of athletes landed at @entity10 for the @entity4 on monday they will head home			1
pictured the famous rings above the arrivals board ghost town : @entity315 looks like a different place as there is n't a soul in sight not over yet ? the @entity320 will take place in the @entity315 over the coming weeks video : @entity4 terminal " just like an @entity325 garden "			1

about 6,000 athletes left @entity10 yesterday through a temporary terminal as big as three @entity4 swimming pools
athletes clapped into each terminal by a guard of honour made up of @entity10 volunteers
make - shift games terminal set up in honour of departing stars .
not everyone is flying home , as @entity243 athletes gather to get the @entity233 at @entity188
