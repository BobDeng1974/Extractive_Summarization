@entity8 @entity7 , 26 , came back to to his home in @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 on monday lunchtime to find two computers , an @entity15 , an @entity16 and a gold watch had been stolen , while the stairs had been daubed with spray paint			1
but the misery for he and his girlfriend , @entity21 , was made all the worse when they realised the burglars had also taken their four - month - old pedigree dachshund , @entity25			1
the emotional couple have now made an heart - felt plea to the thieves to return @entity25 - as they continue to walk the streets looking for him			1
mr @entity7 blasted the criminals as ' sick ' , adding : ' it ’s like taking a child because he ’s been a massive part of the family for the last four months and now he ’s gone			2
' i do n’t mind the other things being taken , but not my dog			2
i ’m seething with anger , but that ’s not getting me anywhere			0
' we ’d been talking about getting a dog for a long time and we thought long and hard about getting one			0
' he was beautiful when i first saw him and we are devastated			0
i just hope we get some justice and they go to prison because that ’s what they deserve			0
' the couple say @entity25 , who was a @entity34 present for @entity35 , would have been petrified of any intruders mr @entity7 and @entity35 have been walking the streets looking for @entity25 and have put up posters in @entity10 , @entity12 @entity25 is kept in the conservatory during the day and would have been unable to get out without someone opening the door			1
the front door was also closed when mr @entity7 came home , meaning @entity25 could n’t have escaped of his own accord			1
miss @entity21 , 24 , a beauty manager at @entity72 , says the couple have notified the @entity74 and local dog kennels , are now depserately looking for @entity25 in places where they usually walk him			1
she added : ' it ’s the worst possible thing imaginable			0
' you would think someone coming into your house is bad enough , but nothing compares to them taking your dog			0
' he ’s small and is nervous around people anyway , so he would ’ve been scared and tried to hide behind the couch to get away			0
' we ’ve been everywhere we can think of and it 's just a complete worry			0
' @entity12 @entity91 have appealed for anyone in the area with information to call 101 .			2
