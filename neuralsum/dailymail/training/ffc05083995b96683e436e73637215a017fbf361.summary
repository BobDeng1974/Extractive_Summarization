by @entity1 reporter published : 22:23 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 03:30 est , 4 december 2013 they introduced a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the @entity6 and now @entity7 has been granted the rights for an even more advanced means of security - the face			2
the tech giant was yesterday awarded @entity14 patent no. 8,600,120 , which is a ' personal computing device control using face detection and recognition '			1
in addition to using face recognition for unlocking an @entity21 , it could also be used for unlocking specific features on the phone , according to @entity24			2
for instance , an incoming call or text could only be unlocked by the person who is registered with the facial recognition security			0
interfacing : the future of @entity7 products looks to involve facial recognition in the security process of devices , such as unlocking phones , after the tech giant acquired a new patent on tuesday @entity7 on tuesday was granted a patent - seen here - that uses facial recognition technology to control a computing device , like an @entity21 , @entity43 or @entity44 , allowing for a more secure and productive operating environment the patent 's documents note that face detection and recognition are two different processes			1
detection involves locating faces within an image , while recognition goes deeper by pairing those faces with a particular person or user it joins another patent @entity7 landed two years ago for facial recognition technology , around the time some @entity63 phones began letting users unlock their devices with their faces			1
@entity68 devices already use facial recognition to unlock the phones			0
while experts say the move is likely part of a plan for the @entity21 , just like many other patents the company have acquired , the technology may never acutally be put into play			1
@entity79 reports the patent consists of three systems : a face detection application , which lets it distinguish faces from their surroundings ; a face recognition application , which identifies individual faces ; and an input / output application , which will let @entity89 € ™ s devices act on all the facial data			1
the @entity91 and @entity92 also utilize face recognition for easy logins			0
computers are expected to be the next device to actively use facial recognition			2
if facial recognition systems were to be rolled out , all a device would need to operate it is a computer that faces the user when it comes to computers , the patent says that so long as an image of the person using the device can be seen over a period of time , it could unlock features within the computer exclusive to that user the technology just requires a camera facing the user , making it easy to implement			0
@entity7 also recently completed its acquisition of @entity116 sensing firm @entity115 , an @entity117 firm that helped create the original @entity119 's motion sensing capabilities it has been rumored that @entity7 is working on a 4.8 - inch edge - to - edge display with sapphire glass			0
it has also been rumored that the next - generation @entity21 will have @entity122			0
the next @entity21 is expected to be released in spring 2014 .			1

on tuesday apple were granted the rights to a ' personal computing device control using face detection and recognition '
the technology is expected to be used in both phones and computers and would allow only users to accept calls and texts
experts say it could be developed as part of the @entity21 , rumored to be released in spring 2014
