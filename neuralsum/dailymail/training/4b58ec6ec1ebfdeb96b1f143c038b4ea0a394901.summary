by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 09:59 est , 17 april 2012 when 19 - stone rugby player @entity3 suffered a stroke during a freak accident , his life was transformed - but not in a way that anyone could have predicted			1
when he regained consciousness , the 26 - year - old – who was engaged to his girlfriend at the time – found his sexuality had completely altered			0
' the @entity3 i knew had gone and a new @entity3 sort of came along			1
i came to the realisation that the stroke had turned me gay , ' he said			2
he is now the subject of a @entity19 documentary , chronicling his attempt over the past few months to make sense of his new identity			0
transformed : mr @entity3 has also altered his appearance since the stroke			1
shedding weight and dying his hair @entity3 was a 19st beer - swilling rugby fan before his accident ( left )			1
a stroke radically altered his personality and he swapped banking for hairdressing ( right ) @entity3 had been attempting a forward roll down a hill in 2011 when the blood supply to his brain was cut off causing a stroke			1
during a stroke the areas starved of oxygen , brain cells die and this can cause damage			0
however , the brain can make new neural connections and find different pathways to achieve the same thing			0
some scientists believe it is possible that during this recovery process a patient could discover a new skill , accent or even a new sexuality			0
however , personality changes following a stroke are rare and there have been no documented cases of a stroke changing a person 's sexuality			2
@entity3 points to the hill where he had his stroke but mr @entity3 , for one , is convinced			1
within a year of his stroke he had quit his job at a bank and become a hairdresser , moved out of his family home in the @entity68 valleys and started meeting men			0
' it was a weird experience , ' he told the film crew			2
' you walk into somewhere and you go from liking that girl to liking that boy			1
' he found the changes traumatic and admitted it was a ' lonely time ' when he was afraid to tell anybody about his new sense of self			0
' it was quite a scary process			0
being with the first guy was a very odd experience			0
i did n't know what i was doing , ' he said			2
@entity3 has been putting together a memory box of anything that jogs vague recollections from his past life , such as photos from his school it includes a photo from his school prom and a badge from the @entity96			1
' this jogs something in me , ' he said , holding a pin badge from a trip to see the @entity96			0
' @entity3 likes motorbikes , i really do n't care anymore			1
' he has also developed some old films from a holiday taken just before his accident and was n't best pleased with the results			2
' i look awful , ' he said			0
' it sums old @entity3 up , my @entity107 i looked chavvy ! it feels like looking at somebody else but with my face			1
' new life : @entity3 with his fiance @entity112 the change has put a huge strain on his family and he has lost several close friendships			1
he has also had to deal with negative reactions from strangers after telling his story to the media			0
in a documentary airing tonight , mr @entity3 is seen trying to rebuild his relationship with his mother			1
the 27 - year - old said when he was ill his mother took him back and forth to the doctors and was very protective			2
now he goes to the hospital appointments alone and barely speaks to her			0
' it would be nice if my mother played more of a role in my life , because i always seem happy in the photos that she is in , ' he said , referring to his old albums			2
however , he said he understood how difficult his radical change in personality must be for her			1
' it 's a unique bond so when it 's altered or changed i think there is a bereavement , ' he said			0
despite all the difficulties @entity3 said he has no regrets over how his life has turned out			1
within a few months of moving out from home he met his then boyfriend and now fiance @entity112			2
mr @entity112 has his own theory that @entity3 has always been gay and the accident just helped him to realise it			1
' people grow up not knowing they are gay and have families and then they realise they are gay , but they do n't have a stroke to realise it , ' mr @entity112 said			1
' i think eventually if you had n't had the stroke it would have happened anyway , ' he said			0
but mr @entity3 is not convinced saying he has memories and photos that prove he was definitely straight before the stroke			1
' if i read about it i would n't have believed it , ' he admitted			0
' but here i am			0
' as part of the documentary mr @entity3 visited dr @entity162 of @entity163 in @entity164 who is an expert in human sexual orientation			2
dr @entity162 has tested hundreds of gay and straight volunteers and discovered key neurological patterns that he believes reveal if a person might have been born gay or straight			2
mr @entity3 took part in the computer - based tests to see if it suggested he had actually been ' born gay			1
' they revealed on half of the test @entity3 performed in the ' expected direction ' for a gay man but the other half suggested a straight man			1
dr @entity162 suggested his homosexual feelings may have lain dormant but been brought to the surface by the stroke			0
dr @entity162 said : ' the bulk of the evidence in the biological sciences , in genetics and psychology suggest that sexuality is something you are born with and develops later on through life			0
' either way mr @entity3 said he would n't want to alter back again			1
' i 'm happier now that i ever have been , why would i want to change ? ' he asked .			0

' it was weird , you walk into somewhere and you go from liking that girl to liking that boy '
@entity3 is trying to rebuild his relationship with his mother who has *struggled* with his personality change
@entity3 ' boyfriend believes @entity3 had always been gay but had n't realised
