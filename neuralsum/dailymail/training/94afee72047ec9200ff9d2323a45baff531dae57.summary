by @entity0 published : 21:46 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 06:05 est , 23 january 2014 the @entity2 has refused to punish one of its members for assisting in the torture of a 9/11 terrorist suspect at @entity7			1
leaked documents show that dr @entity9 , now a retired @entity11 reserves , instructed prison staff on ways to obtain intelligence from detainees including @entity16 , the twentieth 9/11 hijacking suspect			1
the methods were so severe even @entity19 officials called them ' torture '			1
methods included forcibly hydrating @entity16 though ivs and then not letting him use the bathroom			0
they also subjected him to loud music , made him bark like a dog and deprived him of sleeping saying he can go to bed ' when he tells the truth '			0
but in an @entity2 letter obtained by the @entity34 from december 31 , they decided they ' can not proceed with formal charges in this matter			2
consequently the complaint against dr @entity9 has been closed '			1
fact : leaked documents prove that dr @entity9 aided in the torture of a suspected terrorist at @entity7 the @entity2 does n't deny that dr @entity9 took part in the torture , but says his actions did n't meet the burden of ' direct unethical conduct ' since he was a noted critic of the military 's intelligence gathering approach			1
@entity9 and colleague major @entity50 were the authors of an interrogation handbook of sorts - a memorandum called ' @entity55 which advised on how to best get information from prisoners			2
' all aspects of the [ detention ] environment should enhance capture shock , dislocate expectation , and support exploitation to the fullest extent possible , ' one section read			0
@entity66 : but the @entity2 ruled last month that they will not carry out charges against @entity9 , one of their members			1
on the left , @entity16 , the terrorist suspect he helped torture			0
on the right , a detainee being interrogated at @entity75 but @entity9 and @entity50 distanced themselves from the document during a @entity79 panel in 2007 , saying they were ' not comfortable with the memo they were asked to produce '			2
prior to that , just a month before logs show he aided in the interrogation of @entity16 , @entity9 was in a @entity7 meeting in which he said that detainee abuse may not prove fruitful			1
' force is risky , and may be ineffective due to the detainees ' frame of reference , ' he said in october 2002			0
' they are used to seeing much more barbaric treatment			0
' these occasions of noted discomfort are what the @entity2 are using to defend their move in exonerating @entity97			0
' available evidence in the public domain also includes that , in the face of pressure from the highest levels of the @entity104 administration which strongly supported ‘ enhanced ’ interrogation tactics , the respondent sought consultation and argued against such approaches and in favor of rapport - building approach , ' wrote @entity111 , the deputy director of the @entity2 ’s ethics office , in the december 31 letter			2
the @entity2 's decision has not been popular among other psychologists who believe this breaks their ' do no harm ' rule			0
@entity119 is the @entity120 psychologist who complained about @entity9 's work at @entity7 to the @entity2 and said their decision sends the message that ' psychologists are free to violate our ethical code , perhaps , in certain situations ' .			1

dr @entity9 consulted on the interrogation methods at @entity7
the methods were so severe that even @entity19 officials called them ' torture '
the @entity2 decided last month not to punish him
they cite *instances* where he spoke about being *uncomfortable* with detainee abuse
