@entity2 's @entity1 series @entity3 has become a huge hit for its portrayal of @entity7 millenials			1
but , a new infographic shows , the numbers do n't quite add up when it comes to @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 's financials			1
the research , by @entity16 , finds that the average pre-tax income for the characters ' respective jobs would n't always cover living expenses and typical rent for the apartments in which they live			1
@entity15 would be the most deeply in debt - largely because she is a student at @entity26 for the first three seasons			1
tuition fees of $ 3,847.50 per month , share of an apartment in @entity32 's trendy @entity31 ( $ 1,275 per month ) and living expenses of $ 1,327.04 per month , add up to a hefty $ 6,449.54			1
by this point , @entity11 is working as a copywriter for @entity46 and can more than afford her $ 1,450 - per - month share of rent while we can assume that @entity15 's parents pick up that tab , the same is not true of @entity11 , who struggled in season one when her parents cut her off			1
though she managed to find a job in @entity35 , her monthly income of $ 1,512 barely covers her share of rent on the @entity55 , @entity56 , apartment she shares with @entity12 ( $ 1,450 ) , let alone living expenses of $ 1,509.18 each month			1
this adds up to a monthly loss of $ 1,447.18			0
@entity11 's finances look healthier by season two thanks to her budding career as a writer			2
@entity16 calculates that she would have been earning $ 35,000 a year ( $ 2,916.67 per month ) , narrowing her loss to $ 42.51 per month			0
and by season three , her job as a copywriter for @entity46 ( @entity66 's @entity65 famously made a cameo as her boss ) meant that she was well and truly in the black , making $ 2,436.65 a month after paying her rent and living expenses			1
at least until she quits			0
@entity32 lifestyle : @entity15 , a student at @entity26 in seasons one , two and three , spends $ 1,275 per month on her share of a @entity31 apartment - luckily her parents pick up the tab for rent , tuition and living expenses falling apart : @entity13 's finances are the healthiest of all the girls until she enters rehab			1
she would still be contributing $ 1,450 a month rent in @entity55 , but without an income , plus living expenses , she would be losing $ 2,959.18 per month in contrast , @entity12 's finances worsen as the seasons progress			1
the art gallery assistant and aspiring singer is found to be making a small loss in season one of just $ 48.60 per month , but by season two ( in which she moves in with @entity15 and must work as a nightclub hostess ) this escalates to a monthly loss of $ 268.71			2
her situation does n't even improve when she finds a new gallery job - it only pays $ 34,927 per year ( $ 2,910.58 per month ) - but by this time she is renting an apartment in @entity32 , costing her $ 2,000 per month , pushing up her monthly loss to $ 1,171.05			0
for such a troubled character , @entity13 manages to keep herself afloat for more of the first three seasons than any of the other characters			0
her job as a nanny in season one brings in $ 673 per week , while her share of @entity110 's apartment costs just $ 1,275 per month			0
things fall apart in season two when she enters rehab though			0
@entity16 calculates that she would be contributing $ 1,450 a month rent in @entity55 , but without an income , plus living expenses , she would be losing $ 2,959.18 per month			1
the cost of rehab is picked up by her grandmother			0
in debt : @entity12 finds a new job as a gallery assistant in season three , but it only pays $ 34,927 per year - and by this time she is renting a $ 2,000 - per - month apartment in @entity32 , pushing up her monthly loss to $ 1,171.05 @entity16 calculated the figures in the infographic by using real - world averages and online postings			2
' for as close a comparison as possible , we used average residential area rent as a basis , ' the site explains			0
' in @entity7 , rent can exhaust roughly 49per cent of a person 's living expenses			1
we did the math from there , selecting one profession ( pre-tax ) and apartment per season for each character			2
' how each character will fare in season four remains to be seen			2
last night 's premier saw @entity11 depart for @entity147 and @entity110 graduate from @entity26			0
@entity12 's attempts at a singing career are poorly received by diners at a ( jazz - free ) jazz brunch and @entity13 is left crushed when her role as carer to @entity155 is snatched away after attempting to help the elderly photographer commit suicide			0
fact meets fiction : the figures in the infographic were calculated using real - world averages and online postings			0
they show that @entity13 would have been the only character actually making money in season one broke : by season two , all of the @entity3 girls would be deeply in debt by real world standards , though @entity11 's monthly loss is down to just $ 42.51 ups and downs : season three sees @entity11 get a well - paid job as a @entity46 copywriter , but @entity12 falls deeper into the red after moving in to a $ 2,000 - a - month apartment			2

a new infographic calculates how much each character might earn and spend on rent and living expenses
@entity15 would be the most deeply in debt if her parents were n't paying her bills
