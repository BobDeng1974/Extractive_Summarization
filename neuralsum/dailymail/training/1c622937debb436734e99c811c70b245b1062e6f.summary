@entity0 is a major injury doubt ahead of @entity3 ’s opening group game against @entity4 after limping out of training on tuesday			1
@entity0 pulled up midway through the 90 minute session based on team shape ahead of saturday ’s clash with @entity10 ’s side			1
the @entity3 winger , who is a firm selection favourite with @entity3 head coach @entity13 , appears to have a hamstring strain			2
blow : @entity0 could miss @entity3 's first game against @entity4 after limping out of training with an injury tanning : @entity0 , @entity19 and @entity20 mobbed on the beach in @entity22 he left the training ground with blue tape on the inside of his thigh after undergoing treatment with @entity3 head physio @entity28			1
@entity13 also revealed that the players have started practising penalties and they were taken without a keeper during yesterday ’s session			0
@entity3 ’s players were asked to nominate a spot in the goal and had to shoot through hoops as part of the drill which is believed to have involved every squad member			2
@entity0 ’s chances of starting against @entity4 in @entity41 appear to rest on whether the @entity43 forward can train fully in the next two days			1
@entity13 worked on @entity3 ’s attacking play during the session and trialled @entity46 in the @entity48 role behind @entity49 for much of it			1
the @entity52 flyer also played right and left as @entity13 tinkered with his team shape in training			1
@entity55 and now @entity56 are also in the hunt to play alongside @entity58 and @entity49 in an attacking @entity3 formation			2
@entity13 is clearly tempted to start @entity46 against @entity4 on saturday and insists it would n’t be a risk to play him			1
he has played just 39 minutes of football in the last five weeks and was sent off during @entity3 ’s friendly with @entity63 during the team ’s stopover in @entity66			1
mover : @entity0 finds himself getting involved with some @entity69 dancers on monday @entity70 ! @entity0 and @entity49 with @entity72 dancers in @entity22 @entity13 added : ‘ he ’s as fit as a flea and i ’m pretty certain that he has n’t forgotten how to play matches either			2
‘ it was unfortunate that he could n’t play the game , but i can tell you that @entity46 is very much in the group of players i ’m considering			1
‘ if i select him , it wo n’t be in my opinion a risk that he has n’t played so many minutes			0
‘ and if i do n’t select him , it certainly wo n’t be because he has only played 39 minutes			0
‘ it will be because i prefer someone else			0
that ’s all i can tell you			0
’ @entity13 also revealed that @entity88 is making progress and should be fit for @entity3 ’s second group game against @entity91 on june 19 in @entity92			1
yesterday the @entity3 forward trained without a knee brace but is not yet able to take part in contact practice matches			2
@entity13 added : ‘ it looks very unlikely that we ’ll replace him			0
i do n’t think that will be the case			0
i ’m not a doctor i ca n’t give you real up to date or detailed information about where it is			0
‘ he has got a strained ( right ) medial ligament , that we do know			0
but he is certainly working very hard and i do n’t think he could be further forward in terms of his progression than he is now			0
he ’s well up there			0
’ on the return : @entity88 is working his way back to full fitness relaxed : @entity13 is relatively calm as @entity3 's build - up to their first game gathers pace @entity3 ’s players and staff have also started taking a course of anti-malaria tablets as they prepare to fly to @entity41 on thursday			1
@entity13 , who decided not take the tablets when he flew to the jungle region in december , said : ‘ as far as i ’m concerned , i ’ve got to go with medical opinion			0
‘ if the doctors are telling me that when we go to @entity41 , the players must take malaria tablets , whether it has side - effects or not , what do i do ? ‘ i ca n’t turn around and say “ we will not take malaria tablets ” , because the bottom line is better stomach cramps or whatever it is for one player in ten than have someone contract malaria because that would be unthinkable			2
