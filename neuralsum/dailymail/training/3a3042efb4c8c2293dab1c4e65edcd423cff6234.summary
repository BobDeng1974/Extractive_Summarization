flicking the screen opens the lighter and produces an image of a flame on the screen			0
the 69p hold on ! game ( pictured right ) asks users to compete to see how long they can press the onscreen button			1
it also adds multiplayer elements , over @entity78 ‘ traditional paranormal equipment can be easily fooled when simple mundane bursts of normal energy occur			2
to be accepted onto the @entity83 , apps must be functional in that they must not crash , include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised			0
they must also have a user function and developers ca n't charge for app that does n't do anything			0

the developers caveat these claims by adding it ’s not a medical device			2
the free @entity146 app helps users sleep in the office by creating random common office sounds to convince colleagues they 're working			2
