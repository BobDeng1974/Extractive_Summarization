by @entity0 published : 14:50 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 15:57 est , 21 may 2012 failed by police : no - one has ever been convicted of murdering @entity3 , who was found dead in a pub car park in @entity5 , south @entity6 , in 1987 bungling police and prosecutors caused the collapse of a multi-million pound murder prosecution by losing four crates of evidence , a damning new review has found			1
five inquiries failed to find @entity3 ’s murderer after he was killed in a @entity5 pub car park in 1987 , and the case has become one of @entity20 's most notorious unsolved murders			1
mr @entity3 was found with an axe embedded in his head , and his family have always believed he was killed because he was about to unveil a web of corruption involving his business partner @entity26 , an @entity28 police detective friend named @entity29 , and a string of police officers			1
defence lawyers acting in the case asked for access to particular documents just a month before the last murder trial collapsed at the @entity37 last year			2
it then emerged that four whole boxes of evidence had been left in storage instead of being handed over , and that three were relevant to the trial proceedings			2
as a result , mr @entity26 and his brothers - in - law @entity43 and @entity45 were cleared of any involvement in the killing			0
the report said : ' the police team were unable , in respect of four of the boxes , to locate them ...			1
these latest developments proved to be the final undoing and the cumulative weight against the @entity58 's position became untenable			2
' the review was jointly produced by the police and @entity61 , and while it found that the loss of the boxes was the case 's ' final undoing ' , it also criticised the ' unreliability of critical witnesses '			1
the three witnesses in question were ' assisting offenders ' - commonly known as ' supergrasses ' - whose handling is covered by the @entity72 of 2005 ( @entity72 )			2
they were undermined by what the report called ' factors that adversely affected their credibility ' , and this led to the collapse of the case against two other defendants - @entity82 , accused of murder , and former detective sergeant @entity29 , charged with perverting the course of justice			1
the costs of the five police inquiries and an inquest , as well as three years of legal hearings , are unofficially estimated at £ 30 million			1
the report found : ' this was a truly exceptional case in terms of a combination of factors , namely its age ; the size and the number of linked operations ; the enormous volume of material generated , particularly unused , and the fact that all three of the @entity72 witnesses were undermined , post charge , by factors that adversely affected their credibility			1
in addition there was a lack of scientific evidence			0
' a total of 17 points of ' good practice ' were included in the review			2
the guidance relating to supergrasses states that a ' thorough investigation addressing the credibility of the witness ' is vital whenever they are used			0
cleared : @entity29 ( left ) was cleared of perverting the course of justice , while @entity26 ( right ) was acquitted when the murder case against him collapsed there should also be a ' full and auditable record of all police contact regarding the management of any @entity72 witness ' and ' consideration needs to be given at the outset to the types of unused material that could reasonably be expected to be encountered in a particular prosecution , and its anticipated location '			2
the good practice guidance adds : ' consideration must be given to the size and complexity of the disclosure task from the outset			0
' scene of the crime : the @entity140 in @entity5 , where private eye @entity3 was found axed to death in the car park assistant commissioner @entity144 and @entity145 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity6 , issued a joint statement today			1
it said : ' this case , as the trial judge said , was of an exceptional scale and complexity , with over three quarters of a million documents gathered over 20 years being examined			2
' the issues around the disclosure exercise were such that we could not guarantee that all relevant material had been identified , considered and disclosed so as to ensure a fair trial			0
a further factor related to the unreliability of critical witnesses			0
' to this end , the purpose of the review was to identify potential good practice and learning for both police and prosecutors for future cases			0
' what the review was not was an investigation into allegations of corruption ; nor was it intended to serve the purpose of an investigation for police disciplinary purposes			0
' those recommendations identified within the review will now be implemented by both agencies			0
' @entity179 mp @entity178 has accused the @entity180 of collaborating with suspects in the @entity3 murder case back in march , @entity179 mp @entity178 accused the @entity180 of collaborating with suspects in the @entity3 murder case by placing a senior detective under surveillance on the pretence that he was having an affair			1
speaking during an adjournment debate ahead of the 25th anniversary of mr @entity3 ’s death , he said @entity180 crime journalist @entity190 was a close associate of mr @entity3 's business partner mr @entity26 - who became a main suspect in his murder - and regularly paid his company @entity194 for information			1
‘ @entity26 and @entity29 were at the corrupt nexus of private investigators , police officers and journalists at the @entity180 , ' he said			0
‘ @entity201 was the hub of police and media contacts involving the illegal theft and disclosure of information obtained through @entity26 and @entity209 ’s corrupt contacts			0
’ when detective chief inspector @entity211 started to investigate the murder , at a time when mr @entity26 was still a suspect , it is alleged mr @entity190 placed the police officer under surveillance			0
mr @entity26 was accused of mr @entity3 's murder in 2008 but the case collapsed in 2010			1
@entity219 mp mr @entity178 told the adjournment debate : ‘ the person who was investigating a murder was put under close surveillance by a close business associate of the man he was investigating			0
‘ a journalist tried to undermine a murder investigation			0
’ he added : ‘ i think @entity228 owes the @entity3 family an apology			1
i also do n’t think he has made his last apology to the grieving parents of dead children			0
’ mr @entity190 has previously denied having any contact with @entity3 , and all allegations of wrongdoing .			1

five inquiries failed to find @entity3 ’s murderer after he was killed in a @entity5 pub car park in 1987
total cost of the failed prosecutions is believed to be £ *30m*
damning report finds that the lost boxes and *mishandling* of ' supergrass ' witnesses caused the case 's collapse
