the woman was adopted and raised by a different family			0
she had spent 20 years searching for her biological parents , but without much success			2
about three years into her quest , @entity1 got a first clue about her brother , but initially misinterpreted it , reported @entity38			1
one day at work , the woman and her colleagues were comparing their baby pictures when a friend remarked that @entity1 bore strong resemblance to her husband			2

it was not until 17 years later that she got an unexpected call from her half - sister revealing to her that @entity2 was actually her brother			1
the shocking discovery was compounded by the fact that @entity2 was suffering from a life - threatening medical condition and was in need of a kidney transplant			2
together again : @entity2 and @entity1 learned they were biological siblings in october 2013 @entity1 has known since age 8 that she had been adopted , 8 , but her brother had thought that the people who raised him were his biological parents the 53 - year - old @entity9 man has been on daily dialysis since 2012 when he experienced kidney failure due to diabetes			1

first clue : nearly two decades ago , @entity1 first realized she may be related to @entity2 when her co-worker saw her baby picture and told her that she looked just like her husband @entity1 and @entity2 's story has the makings of a telenovela script , complete two adopted babies , roiling family drama and swirling rumors about siblings separated at birth			1
@entity1 learned she was adopted at age 8			0
after doing some digging , she found out that the names of her birth parents were @entity98 and @entity99			0
as she was searching for her birth parents , @entity1 heard whispers that her parents also had a son who had been adopted out like her			0
when in 1996 her friend and co-worker pointed out that in her childhood picture @entity1 looked just like her husband , the two concluded that @entity2 must be her cousin because everyone thought at the time that @entity1 's birth father - was @entity2 's uncle			1
as it emerged later on , the @entity109 , @entity2 's adoptive parents , were unable to conceive , and so when @entity112 ’s birth mother - became pregnant with a boy , @entity99 made the decision to give the newborn to his sister and her husband			1

@entity2 remembered that his wife had mentioned to him once that her co-worker was @entity99 's biological daughter , and so he took it upon himself to arrange a meeting between @entity1 and her half - siblings			1
last october , @entity1 and her husband invited @entity2 and his wife to dinner			1
in the course of the evening , the two discovered they had a strong , inexplicable connection			0
