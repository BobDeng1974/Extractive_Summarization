by @entity0 for @entity1 historian @entity2 believes that @entity4 spy chief @entity3 , pictured , wanted the @entity6 invasion to fail @entity4 sent 12 @entity4 spies to @entity8 in september 1940 to gather information ahead of @entity11 's planned invasion			1
but most of the agents who arrived as part of @entity15 were arrested without having come close to completing their mission ' because of their own stupidity ' , according to official records			1
one was arrested when he tried to order cider at 10am - not knowing that he could not be served before lunchtime during the war - while another two were spotted cycling on the wrong side of the road			0
their cover was blown when police officers discovered @entity30 hand cream and @entity6 sausages in their bags			0
the reason why @entity4 , known for meticulously - prepared spies , sent such incompetent agents on one of the most important missions of the second world war has remained a mystery			2
now historian @entity2 suggests that the botched mission , part of @entity42 - the code name given to @entity4 's plan to invade - was not a sign of @entity6 ineptness but an act of sabotage by @entity49 officials			1
in her book @entity42 : resistance inside the @entity52 , published this summer , @entity2 traces the mission to a circle of people around @entity3 , the officer in charge of the @entity58 intelligence unit - one of @entity4 's top secret service posts			1
@entity3 had close ties to spy chief @entity61 and to the @entity62 which planned to assassinate @entity11 in july 1944			0
@entity63 described @entity3 and his group as ' good @entity6 , but bad @entity65 '			0
@entity2 told the @entity66 that she believes the spy chief had deliberately sent the agents - many of whom were not fluent in @entity69 - because he feared that @entity42 was badly planned and that it could cost @entity6 lives and resources			2
@entity6 amphibious tanks are prepared for @entity42 , the 1940 plan to invade @entity8 that @entity2 believes was deliberately sabotaged amphibious tanks are prepared for @entity42			1
historian @entity2 argues that @entity3 thought that the mission was badly planned the reason why @entity4 , known for meticulously - prepared spies , sent such incompetent agents on one of the most important missions of the second world war has remained a mystery he also feared that an attack on @entity69 would lead to a full world war			2
to avoid the devastation @entity3 sent citizens with low levels of intelligence and a resounding enthusiasm for @entity88			0
many of them were petty criminals and members of far - right organisations in the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 .			0

@entity4 sent 12 @entity4 spies to @entity8 as part of @entity15 in 1940
many of them were caught ' because of their own stupidity '
historian believes they were sent to sabotage @entity4 's plans to invade
