@entity0 of @entity1 will not travel to @entity2 this weekend for her first official solo overseas royal visit because she continues to suffer with extreme morning sickness			1
@entity5 , 32 , who is around eight weeks pregnant with her second child with husband , prince @entity7 , has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition			1
the illness saw @entity5 hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby , @entity13 , now one			1
@entity0 had been due to represent the @entity22 on a two - day visit to the @entity25 island as @entity2 celebrates the 50th anniversary of its independence from @entity28			1
however , the palace confirmed today that prince @entity7 would instead take her place			0
in a statement , the palace said : ' @entity0 of @entity1 will no longer visit @entity2 this weekend			1
the @entity1 will undertake the visit instead			2
' @entity34 continues to suffer from the effects of hyperemesis gravidarum			1
the decision not to travel was taken by the @entity1 and @entity0 on the advice of the @entity39 's doctors			2
' @entity40 is honoured to represent her majesty the queen on the visit , which commemorates the 50th anniversary of @entity2 's independence			2
' the visit itinerary remains unchanged			0
' @entity5 , 32 , who is around eight weeks pregnant , suffered the same illness throughout her first pregnancy with @entity13			1
she had been due to represent the @entity22 on a two - day visit to the @entity25 island royal sources earlier told the @entity51 that the @entity0 wanted to wait until the last possible minute to decide whether she was medically fit to go			1
her decision came after a consultation with doctors last night			0
despite being ' desperate ' to attend her first royal overseas appointment , the @entity0 reluctantly agreed to cancel after meeting with @entity56 , surgeon - gynaecologist to the @entity58 , and her obstetrician @entity59 at @entity18			2
her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12 - week stage but there is speculation that the royal couple 's second child could be due in april			1
the trip to @entity2 was to be one of the first solo trips on behalf of the @entity22 for the @entity5 the @entity22 's surgeon - gynaecologist @entity56 ( pictured ) is part of the @entity39 's medical team @entity71 affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies			1
the condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘ pregnancy hormone ’ @entity76 , or human chorionic gonadotropin , which increases after conception			2
it causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration , weight loss and a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine , called ketosis			1
it is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers			0
the severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day , with exhausting and hazardous consequences			2
they can not eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week			0
it can trigger a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food			0
hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux , where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat			0
hospital treatment for these women is essential , as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated			0
treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration , as well as supplementation of vitamin b , one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition			0
an intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice			0
the condition can also affect the baby ’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight			0
in severe cases , the sickness can trigger a miscarriage			0
the foreign trip had been seen as being a sign of @entity5 's growing royal role , not least because the island holds such a special place in the @entity22 's heart			1
the monarch spent many happy months there before she acceded to the throne when her husband , prince @entity155 was stationed there with the @entity157			0
highlights of the eagerly anticipated trip were a visit to the national library to see letters from past @entity28 monarchs @entity164 and @entity165 , @entity167 celebrations and a number of walkabouts .			2
