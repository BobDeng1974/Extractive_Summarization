by @entity0 @entity2 footage has emerged of a ' @entity4 ' group of thrill seekers who jump on moving trains and scale the roof tops of high rise buildings			1
the trio call themselves @entity12 and in an 11 - minute video they show off ways to experience unrivalled views of @entity17 by scaling buildings and trains			1
in the footage , they are seen using hidden or restricted staircases to gain access to the rooftops of the city 's high rises - including the @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 - as well as one of @entity32 's largest construction sites , the 72 - storey @entity33			2
but what has alarmed @entity56 the most are the group 's train - surfing antics , where they are seen jumping off station platforms and latching themselves onto the outside of moving trains as well as breaking into the train driver 's compartment			1
the footage - which has so far garnered more than 8,000 views - emerged just days after the body of a naked 25 - year - old man was retrieved by police in a stunt gone wrong			1
it is thought the man was electrocuted by power lines after he climbed to the roof of a moving train while it was pulling into @entity78 station , near @entity79 , in @entity17 's south - east			1
in the footage , you can see them scale buildings as well as trains in @entity17 @entity56 said they are now investigating the alarming footage the group have also filmed themselves breaking into the train driver 's compartment victoria police inspector @entity88 said the kind of videos released by @entity12 was ' glamourising ' risky - and sometimes life - threatening - behaviour			1
' i consider this [ behaviour ] as very , very risk , quite silly in many ways , ' he said			0
' i think it 's becoming more and more public			0
online creates an audience [ where ] you 've got access to tens of thousands of people instantaneously			0
' sometimes it 's the motivation for these individuals ... to increase their profile			0
' police say most of this behaviour was graffiti - related they have warned people against putting themselves in such risky situations police say the online culture gives them access to a wider audience which is a possible motivator for this behaviour insp @entity88 also shed some light on how they were gaining access to areas that are not open to the public			2
' some of these people are quite sophisticated , they operate in crews , ' he said			0
' they have got a different range of techniques - [ including ] access keys			0
we 've seen in the past they tended to be @entity129 [ train operator ] workers			0
' insp @entity88 confirmed police would be investigating the video to catch offenders			2
he said a lot of the behaviour seen in the video was graffiti related and there were teams dedicated to investigating these crimes			0
the release of the footage comes just days after a 25 - year - old died in a stunt gone wrong where he climbed on top of a @entity17 train police say groups like @entity12 use many different techniques to gain access to restricted areas - in the past , some have found to be @entity129 train staff their behaviour has been labelled as ' risky and dangerous ' by police			1
