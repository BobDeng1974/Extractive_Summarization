by @entity0 it was the policy announcement that really ruffled feathers among @entity5 ’s 47,000 @entity4 followers			1
after a prankster managed to hack into the party press team ’s @entity4 account yesterday , it seemed that @entity10 had come up with his most revolutionary policy so far			1
‘ everybody should have his own owl , ’ said the tweet that quickly took flight on social media			2
@entity17 - owl @entity18 : @entity10 in a mock picture on @entity4 yesterday @entity20 ; s your sandwhich : a @entity4 used the now renowned photo of the @entity5 leader eating a bacon sandwhich last month the @entity26 was left bemused after its @entity4 accounts accidentally sent a message declaring that ' everybody should have his own owl ' the offer was quickly dubbed @entity10 's ' @entity31 ' , with many @entity33 insiders joking that it was his most popular idea yet former deputy leader @entity35 was quick to reply			1
‘ i ’ve always been @entity5 , ’ he declared			2
the political blogger @entity36 tweeted : ‘ for more information about the @entity5 owl policy , contact their press office on 28 28 20			1
’ one tweeter said : ‘ we had hoped our compulsory owl guarantee would be a head turning policy , but sadly it ’s no longer going to take flight			0
another , @entity49 , said : ‘ you know ... i think a free owl would actually genuinely make me vote @entity5			0
’ other internet posters put up mock images of mr @entity10 with owls , including one that was pasted on to the picture of him struggling with a bacon sandwich last month			0
more serious - minded observers pointed out that it would be a policy unlikely to find support at the @entity63 , as baby barn owls cost around £ 80 each			0
to provide one for all 63million people in the country would cost a barnstorming £ 5billion a year , or around 5 per cent of the entire budget for the @entity68			0
what a wise owl would think of @entity5 ’s chances of winning the general election next year is another matter			0
the party deleted the message but not before it sparked an internet craze			2
@entity5 's press @entity4 account sent a message later trying to make light of the gaffe @entity82 's manifesto in 2010 pledged a ' future fair for all '			1
internet spoofs quickly emerged today claiming @entity10 would go into the 2015 general election promising a ' future owl for all ' owls , like these at the @entity88 , can cost hundreds of pounds each on bird trader websites @entity92 famously had a pet owl named @entity94 which died in 1854			1
the nurse and her pet are seen here in a drawing by her sister @entity99 , later to become @entity100			0

party accidentally *unveils* new ' @entity104 policy ' in @entity4 message
@entity5 quickly deleted the tweet , but not before it was *spotted* *online*
