the @entity0 want @entity2 owner @entity1 to name the two influential people at the top of their organisation who told him ‘ nothing would come ’ from the ongoing investigation of new club manager @entity9			1
@entity1 made the claim in between crass and offensive remarks about @entity12 and @entity14 people while defending his decision to appoint @entity9			1
the @entity0 are already investigating @entity9 , who is accused of sending racist , sexist and homophobic texts			1
there is considerable annoyance at @entity19 about @entity1 ’s alleged knowledge about the outcome of that inquiry , especially as none of the executive team , nor @entity0 board members , is said to have spoken with @entity2 ’s owner			1
the @entity0 want @entity2 owner @entity1 to name the two people who told him about the ongoing investigation read @entity29 on why @entity1 is a man stuck in the past on the issue of race several senior @entity0 officials , including @entity34 , the independent director and @entity0 inclusion board chair , have been pushing for @entity9 to be charged			1
@entity37 , the @entity0 ’s director of football services , is leading the @entity9 investigation , which has been complicated by the issue of whether the texts were private or not			1
there is no question @entity1 ’s comments are public but @entity9 ’s remarks emerged from a private text exchange with his @entity47 director of football @entity48 , as were @entity51 chief executive @entity50 ‘ s sexist exchanges with @entity51 lawyer @entity53			1
and @entity50 escaped @entity0 censure			1
neither @entity2 nor @entity1 would comment about the ‘ @entity0 assurances ’ but club insiders say 77 - year - old @entity1 is prone to forgetfulness			1
he has until wednesday to respond to a ‘ very concerned ’ @entity0			2
@entity9 was appointed @entity2 manager this week , despite the text and email scandal we revealed @entity51 official @entity62 has quit as head of @entity65 ’s referee academy in protest at the county @entity0 taking no action against vice-president @entity69			1
@entity69 was banned for four months by the @entity0 for his comment that a ‘ woman ’s place is in the kitchen and all the time i ’m alive a woman will never referee in my league ’			2
four other county officials have also stepped down after the secret ballot verdict that no further local disciplinary measures needed to be taken against @entity69			2
he made his remarks to referee development officer @entity81 , @entity62 ’s partner			2
@entity51 official @entity62 has quit as head of @entity65 's referee academy in protest such was the surprise at world dressage champion @entity87 being voted @entity90 / @entity89 sportswoman of the year that some believed there had been a mix - up during the awards ceremony			2
many assumed @entity96 , who won the @entity97 10,000 metres at the age of 41 , would finish first rather than third			2
if not , then runner - up @entity101 , the @entity103 skeleton champion , rather than @entity87 , whose sport receives little attention outside the @entity103			0
@entity87 won the panel vote easily with @entity90 chief @entity108 pushing her case			0
@entity96 was named @entity110 ’ female athlete of the year on friday			0
@entity87 was named as @entity112 for 2014 after her dressage exploits @entity87 won two gold medals aboard @entity115 at the @entity116 former sports journalist @entity117 , the most unlikely hack ever to cross the @entity119 into public relations when close friend @entity121 took him to @entity122 , will cause surprise again with @entity124 making him their new head of media			0
the difficulty @entity128 2015 faces trying to shift tickets for eight @entity130 matches at the @entity131 is highlighted by the option to buy as many as 15 when online sales resume on monday			0
tickets are still available for five games in @entity47 , including @entity137 ’s group matches against @entity138 and @entity139			0
worryingly for @entity142 and @entity143 rugby , there were 17,000 empty seats for their autumn international against @entity145			0
@entity146 also has 15 - tickets - per - customer availability for all three of their group games			0
they might have sold better if the matches were at @entity146 ’ @entity152 rather than @entity154 ’s @entity153 , which has better facilities			0
tickets are still available for five games in @entity47 , including @entity137 ’s group matches against @entity138 and @entity139 even @entity159 , with their global fan base , now have to advertise ticket availability			0
@entity161 were used to publicise unsold corporate packages for the @entity164 game on december 14 with the hospitality at @entity169 cricket ’s @entity167 ground			0

the @entity0 are investigating new @entity2 manager @entity9 , who is accused of sending racist , sexist and homophobic texts
@entity2 owner @entity1 has been defending his appointment of @entity9
the @entity0 want @entity1 to tell them who the two influential people are that *reportedly* told him ' nothing would come ' of the investigation
