whenever an endangered animal dies at the @entity2 , researchers race out , regardless of the hour , to remove its sperm or eggs , maybe a bit of ear or eyeball , and carefully freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen			1
today , the survival of the northern white rhinoceros and dozens of other species could hinge on the collection amassed over nearly 40 years that has become the largest gene bank of its kind : the @entity16			1
the icy vials may someday even be used in experiments to resurrect recently extinct animals , like the @entity21 bird			2
the stainless steel tanks hold the genetic material of more than 10,000 individual animals from more than 1,000 species and subspecies			1
scientists are racing against the clock to find the best way to utilize the bank 's frozen sperm to produce another one before the northern white goes extinct , which could happen within a decade			2
critics question whether it 's worth spending millions of dollars on species that are down to so few			2
the bank is valued as a genetic archive that has helped advance artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , cloning and stem cell technology			2
but debate is stirring over how far such research should go			0
' the frozen zoo is basically re-arranging the deck chairs on the @entity69 , ' said @entity70 , a senior fellow at the @entity71 at @entity72			0
he noted the world needs to address the problem 's root causes , such as population growth and climate change			0
process : @entity35 submerges a tray holding vials of cells into liquid nitrogen - the bank is valued as a genetic archive that has helped advance artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , cloning and stem cell technology preservation : a small vial containing frozen animal cells is shown to the camera ' screwing around with science to save a white rhino might be fun and i would like to see it preserved and am all for biodiversity , but it 's so far down the list of things we should be doing first , ' he said			1
with species going extinct at a faster rate , zoos are taking on greater conservation roles and facing deciding which animals are worth focusing efforts on saving			1
some may be extinct by the time another one is reproduced and possibly never live in the wild			0
the northern white 's natural habitat is in war - torn countries like @entity113 and @entity114 , which have been unable to stop poachers			0
the horn is coveted in @entity117 as an aphrodisiac , creating a market that threatens all rhino species			2
there 's also the hurdle of producing enough offspring to avoid inbreeding			0
' we can do all kinds of razzle dazzle things but it 's one thing to make another animal or two or three , but it 's quite another to make a sustainable population from a genetic standpoint , ' said @entity133 , a @entity134 professor who has written about resurrecting the woolly mammoth			1
the challenges , however , are not insurmountable for critically endangered species or possibly recently extinct species , said @entity139 , director of reproductive physiology at the @entity31 , which houses the @entity16			1
' we 're not so much interested in bringing back dinosaurs or mammoths , ' she said			0
' there 's really no place for them now			0
' the @entity16 holds the cell cultures from 12 northern white rhinos - more than the living population : ' there have been other species that have come back from numbers that small so we think there is good reason we can do this with the northern white rhino , ' she said			1
sperm from the @entity16 has been used in artificial insemination to reproduce endangered animals from the giant panda to the @entity162 monal pheasant			1
its frozen cells also were used to clone two endangered types of cattle			1
on the brink of extinction : the northern white 's natural habitat is in war - torn countries like @entity113 and @entity114 , which have been unable to stop poachers in high demand : the rhino 's horn is also coveted in @entity117 as an aphrodisiac ( above , the only northern white left in the @entity178 , 40 - year - old @entity179 at the @entity2 ) the gaur lived only a few days while the banteng survived for seven years before being put down after breaking a leg			1
both animals , however , had genetic defects			1
the northern white rhino and the drill monkey were the first endangered animals to have their cells transformed into stem cells and stored at the @entity16			1
theoretically stem cells can produce any body tissue			0
that means thawed stem cells from a male rhino could produce both sperm and egg in the lab , but the method has been done only once - in a mouse			2
artificial insemination has seen success in producing other rhino species			0
northern white rhino semen could be used to impregnate the closely related southern white to make a hybrid			0
scientists are also looking at in vitro fertilization but that technique has never been done on any rhino species			0
on a recent day , the only northern white left in the @entity178 , 40 - year - old @entity179 , munched on apples at the @entity44			0
when she dies , there is talk of placing her in the @entity216 so future generations can see a northern white rhino .			0
