@entity0 deserved to be sent off , irrespective of the @entity3 players ' appeals for handball just prior to their captain 's mindless act of aggression			1
@entity9 ’s @entity8 was breaking after a @entity3 attack , but he was still well inside his own half with plenty of opponents to beat , so any thought that this was a red card for the denial of an obvious goal scoring were well wide of the mark			0
@entity0 ’s act was a wild , violent kick at his opponent which deserves the three - match ban it carries			2
@entity3 captain @entity0 chops down @entity9 's @entity8 from behind the @entity24 10 ( centre ) was rightly shown a straight red card by referee @entity27 after his kick @entity0 trudges off the field after his wild act of aggression that left his team hanging on for their 2 - 1 win while both managers made claims of refereeing errors i could see nothing wrong with @entity9 ’s goal , other than a goalkeeping error by @entity42			1
and at the other end , assistant referee @entity43 was absolutely correct to signal that @entity45 was in an offside position before he ‘ scored ’ @entity9 ’s late equaliser			0
referee @entity27 was correct in ruling out @entity9 's equaliser from @entity45 ( centre ) for offside replays clearly showed that @entity45 's head was closer to the @entity3 goal line than the @entity3 defenders only showing @entity55 ( centre ) a yellow card for tripping @entity58 ( second from right ) was also correct replays showing that his head was closer to the goal line than the defenders proving the decision , while close , was accurate			1
finally , there was the unedifying sight of @entity3 players trying to pressurise referee @entity27 to dismiss @entity55 when he tripped @entity58			2
it was a clear yellow card offence and a demonstration to @entity70 ’s captain of how to stop a break away without getting sent off			0

@entity77 captain @entity0 deserved to be sent off for his wild kick at @entity8
it was a mindless act of aggression that *fully* *justifies* a three - match ban
if @entity0 *wanted* to stop a break away without getting sent off , he should have tripped his opponent in the manner that @entity55 took out @entity58
@entity27 was correct in ruling out @entity45 's ' equaliser ' as the @entity9 player 's head was closer to the goal line than the @entity3 defenders
the only error in @entity9 's goal was made by @entity42
