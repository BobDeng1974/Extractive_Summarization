tragic death : eight - week - old @entity11 , whose father allegedly either kicked or stamped on the back of her head , or may have crushed her skull by pressing it against a hard surface such as a floor ‘ there is no doubt that he did cause those injuries in a deliberate and unlawful assault upon his daughter , ’ @entity31 , prosecuting , told @entity32 today			1
‘ when he inflicted these injuries , he can only have intended to cause her really serious bodily harm and therefore the prosecution alleges he is guilty of her murder			0
’ he said the incident happened ‘ during a short period of time when he was in sole charge of @entity11 while her mother @entity49 was out of the house ’			1
there were no concerns about @entity11 ’s care during her short life , and the family home @entity8 shared with @entity57 , his partner since 2006 , was ‘ spotless ’ , the prosecution said			1
but @entity8 had a drink problem which he hid from @entity60 - and before attacking @entity11 he drank at least four miniature bottles of whisky , two vodka miniatures and two beers , the court was told			2
he filmed himself in his bathroom drinking two whiskies that lunchtime , saying ‘ @entity68 strong is that ’ before belching			0
after the attack he bought two more miniatures and did n’t ring 999 , the jury heard			0

the family home they shared was ' spotless ' , the prosecution said , and there were no concerns about @entity11 's care during her short life mr @entity79 said drink ‘ certainly played a part ’ in the murder and the amount he had consumed was ‘ worrying ’ if he was caring for an eight - week - old baby			1
ms @entity57 was away for 20 minutes while driving her mother @entity85 home			0
when she got back , @entity8 called out to her to say he clashed heads with @entity11 after she was sick while he fed her			2
' he did cause those injuries in a deliberate and unlawful assault upon his daughter			0
when he inflicted these injuries , he can only have intended to cause her really serious bodily harm ' @entity31 , prosecuting an ambulance took her to @entity95 , and after doctors became suspicious , the father was arrested and later bailed			0
after she died he was re-arrested on suspicion of murder but before detectives spoke to him , he told his father @entity100 : ‘ i ’ve fallen on her , dad			0
’ he maintained they banged heads and that he then fell on the baby			1
he cut his wrist with a razor and later told a forensic nurse it was ‘ an accident , i did n’t mean to do it ’ , the jury heard			0
mr @entity79 said @entity8 will maintain it was an accident , but a pathologist ’s view was that a simple fall would not have been forceful enough to cause the severe skull fracturing			2
