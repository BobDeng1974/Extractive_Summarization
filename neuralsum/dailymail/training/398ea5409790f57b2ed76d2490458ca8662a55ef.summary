by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 14:19 est , 14 october 2012 a nine - year - old girl suffering from an extremely rare liver condition which turns her skin and eyes yellow has to spend up to 12 hours every day under bright blue ultraviolet lights to stay healthy			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , spends each night tucked up in bed beneath the lights she needs to help battle the serious disease , which can sometimes lead to brain damage			1
her skin and eyes turn yellow whenever she has a sudden change in mood caused by illness , injury , stress , being bullied at school or even arguing with her six - year - old brother			1
condition : @entity7 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , spends each night tucked up in bed beneath the lights she needs to help battle @entity27 , which can sometimes lead to brain damage @entity7 suffers from @entity27 , meaning she has dangerously high levels of bilirubin , a naturally occurring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver			1
she has to sleep under a 4ft bank of phototherapy lights over her bed - but as she gets older it is likely she will need a liver transplant , which can cause complications			2
the uv rays from the blue light affect the bilirubin in her system when they come into contact with her red blood cells and skin tissue			1
by helping to manage bilirubin levels in her body and keep them at an acceptable level , @entity7 is saved from any long term damage			1
her father @entity52 , 29 , said : ‘ her bilirubin levels were considerably high , right up in the high twenties for the first month or so after being born			1
family : @entity7 ( front ) , lives with her father @entity58 , 29 , ( right ) mother @entity59 , 28 , ( left ) and brother @entity58 , six ( centre ) in @entity8 , @entity9 - near @entity62 ‘ we were told soon after the diagnosis that she was only the 52nd person in the country ( the @entity66 ) to have the disorder and just the 212th in the world			1
' we were told after the diagnosis that she was only the 52nd person in the country ( the @entity66 ) to have the disorder and just the 212th in the world ' @entity52 , father ‘ in the past three or four years her body has maintained a much more steady level of around 10 - 15 - the average person has a level of around 0.5 so it 's still very high			2
‘ she was started on @entity78 immediately , and used what was called a “ bili blanket ” , which is a small phototherapy blanket until she grew out of it			0
‘ whenever she is unwell and believe it or not whenever she has a sudden change in her mood such as getting upset at her brother or if she gets bullied then her skin tone changes drastically to a much more visible “ yellow ” until she calms herself back down			2
‘ she also sleeps under a 4ft long bank of phototherapy lights every single night , for at least nine hours a night which typically keeps her skin tone fairly ' normal '			1
brave girl : @entity7 suffers from @entity27 , meaning she has dangerously high levels of bilirubin , a naturally occurring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver ‘ the only thing you can really see is her yellow eyes			1
people ask us all the time : “ why are your daughter 's eyes yellow ” ? ’ ' the only thing you can really see is her yellow eyes			1
people ask us all the time : " why are your daughter 's eyes yellow " ? ' mr @entity52 after being born @entity7 underwent tests and was constantly in and out of the hospital for two weeks before finally being transferred to the @entity114 in @entity9			1
she was eventually diagnosed with @entity27 at two - and - a - half weeks old and spent the best part of a month in hospital before being released			2
phototherapy has helped bubbly @entity7 , but the treatment becomes less successful as she grows up - so her dosage of phenobarbital must increase			2
@entity122 medication helps jump start her liver but whenever the dosage is increased she feels lethargic for weeks and constantly falls asleep at home and school - as well as feeling depressed			0
helping hand : the uv rays from the blue light affect the bilirubin in her system when they come into contact with her red blood cells and skin tissue mr @entity52 added : ‘ it 's difficult for her social life - having sleepovers at home is hard due to her lights and we have not allowed her stay at her friend ’s house due to not having the lights			1
' it 's difficult for her social life - having sleepovers at home is hard due to her lights and we have not allowed her stay at her friend ’s house due to not having the lights ' mr @entity52 ‘ during the winter months it 's even harder since we do n’t have the bright sun to use to our advantage as the uv rays also act as a natural phototherapy light			0
‘ long term effects of the lights include having gallstones , so normally a @entity158 - @entity157 patient eventually has their gallbladder taken out			0
‘ the lights are also very bright and will likely affect her eyes			2
the medication she takes is a barbiturate so taking it for the rest of her life is also going to cause problems			0
‘ her disorder will never go away , with the exception of getting a liver transplant			0
there have been talks of an experimental process called gene therapy , but it has been in the testing phase for years due to the lack of funds for research			0
hopes : she has n't let her illness stop her from aiming high - and hopes to become a famous tv star one day ‘ while we were in the @entity114 after she was born , my wife and i were both tested for compatibility , and it was determined that i would be a good donor			0
' @entity7 loves to sing , play guitar and draw and has also been in multiple plays and dance performances for school - she is the typical " artsy " type of young girl ' mr @entity52 ‘ the process would take a portion of my liver and have it implanted into her body , which will than grow into her			2
‘ the problem with the transplant is that she will still be taking anti-rejection pills the rest of her life and there are many risks in the transplant			0
‘ we know families who have had the transplant , and in return , have had many problems and complications afterwards			0
we have been told that we would need to make a decision on the transplant by her pre-teens			0
’ @entity7 , who also lives with her mother @entity59 , 28 , and brother @entity58 , six , has n't let her illness stop her from aiming high - and she one day hopes to become a famous tv star			2
still smiling : after being born @entity7 underwent tests and was constantly in and out of the hospital for two weeks before finally being transferred to the @entity114 in @entity9 mr @entity52 said : ‘ @entity7 loves to sing , play guitar and draw and has also been in multiple plays and dance performances for school - she is the typical " artsy " type of young girl			1
‘ on top of her creative mind she also likes playing softball and riding bikes			0
she asked us if we could put her in a six - week modelling and acting class that she saw on television			0
‘ since the day she graduated she talks everyday about becoming famous and one day having her picture in a magazine or being on a hit @entity238 show			0
‘ although we have n't yet heard anything from the agent 's office i tell her each day to never give up faith that maybe one day she 'll get her big break			0
