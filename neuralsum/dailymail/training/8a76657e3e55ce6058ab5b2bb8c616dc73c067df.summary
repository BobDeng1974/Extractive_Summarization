@entity0 continue to look in to the viability of signing @entity2			1
last week @entity4 boss @entity3 said the @entity5 could not sign the @entity6 because of the @entity8 restraints			0
a £ 200m transfer fee plus a gross package nearing £ 500,000 a week is obviously a massive obstacle			0
but @entity0 ’s money men are still looking into how a deal could be calibrated , especially in the knowledge that tax implications could yet force @entity2 to leave @entity16			1
@entity0 are still interested in a deal to sign four - time @entity18 winner @entity2 ( second left ) @entity19 is the next @entity20 manager who faces the axe			1
in a shock development it is understood @entity19 is suddenly under immense pressure at @entity25 in the wake of @entity28 ’s dismissal at @entity29			1
the 66 - year - old @entity30 became the first @entity20 managerial casualty of the season on saturday			2
the man who is being lined to replace @entity19 as new @entity35 boss is former @entity37 manager @entity36 , currently in charge at @entity39			1
@entity19 is under mounting pressure at @entity35 after the @entity42 defeat by @entity43 referee @entity45 books @entity25 and @entity46 forward @entity47 during the 1 - 0 defeat at the start of the season @entity19 seemed fireproof			1
such was the @entity52 ’s reputation that he was spoken of as potential successor to @entity54 at @entity55 or even a future @entity37 manager			2
but @entity25 have underperformed this season and @entity59 sources tell us that @entity19 ’s job is now on the line			1
derby manager @entity36 ( right ) could be the man to replace @entity19 should he be sacked @entity63 has emerged as a leading candidate to become the new @entity29 manager after the dismissal of @entity28			1
@entity63 is a former @entity29 player and currently boss of @entity68 in his native @entity69			1
as soon as @entity28 was dismissed the names of @entity72 , @entity70 were bandied about			0
so to @entity73 ( @entity75 coach now at @entity76 ) and strangely @entity78 @entity77			2
but @entity63 could prove to be a shock appointment			2
former @entity29 defender and assistant manager @entity63 watches his @entity68 side in the @entity82 in @entity83 last week @entity85 to @entity76 stories are now in over drive			1
this column revealed that @entity88 ’s @entity85 will be @entity76 ’s ' @entity89 ' signing next summer a month ago			1
but that does not necessarily mean @entity91 will leave @entity76 for @entity92 at the end of the season because of @entity85 ’s arrival as has been predicted in some quarters			1
yes , @entity92 want @entity91			0
they are prepared to pay a £ 120million transfer fee and give the player at least £ 350,000 a week wages			0
but we are told ideally @entity91 wants to negotiate a new contract and stay in @entity16			0
@entity88 and @entity102 winger @entity85 celebrates scoring against @entity103 back in november i am hearing : such is the vanity of top flight footballers that at @entity4 ’s @entity109 training ground there is now a ' resident ' teeth - whitening dentist			1
i am also hearing : if @entity114 and @entity115 part company at the end of the season then @entity112 is a leading candidate to replace him			1
i bet : @entity114 are 25 - 1 with @entity118 to beat @entity55 on sunday			0
that ’s got to be worth the cost of a skinny latte for the potential return of a bulls eye			0
btw : i ’m still baffled why the @entity20 felt it appropriate to stage a minute 's applause ahead of @entity42 matches in memory of the so called @entity127 which allegedly happened at the first @entity128 of the @entity129 can anyone actually provide proof such a game occurred ? actually , i understand it could have been there were several impromptu ' kickabouts ' on several fronts from @entity138 to @entity139			2
@entity114 players line up for a minute 's applause ahead of their @entity42 defeat at @entity4 but in essence it ’s one of the myths that have run out of control			2
moreover why does the corporate football machine of the @entity20 think they can ' own ' this story in a manner where it seems they say : ' we unite the world '			0
it is estimated around 15million people died as a consequence of the 1914 - 18 conflict			0
i ca n’t see any reason to clap about that			0
certainly not for reflected glory			0
@entity161 : it had been the longest time from the start of a @entity20 season for a manager to be sacked since 1996 , when @entity167 was ousted by @entity168			1
but on saturday the seal was finally broken as @entity28 was shown the door by @entity29			2
now @entity28 is not everyone ’s cup of tea			0
indeed i know of some people in the game who would happily punch him on the nose			0
@entity29 sacked manager @entity28 ( centre ) after the 3 - 1 @entity42 defeat by @entity180 but to be axed so soon after being appointed at the start of the season after @entity182 parted company with the club having ' fallen out ' with supremo @entity185 before a ball had been kicked ? seems rash			1
yes , @entity188 will point to the fact that last season getting rid of @entity191 and appointing @entity182 in the autumn saved the club ’s @entity20 bacon			2
he might be proved correct again			0
on the other hand , if the now parted @entity28 was such a mistake one has to wonder at the rationale of recruitment at @entity29			2
@entity29 co-chairman @entity185 ( right ) has seen two managers come and go since august but of course the trend in the modern game is for boardroom chiefs to sack the manager the moment the natives get restless on the basis of acting before the natives turn on , well , them			1
looking back the often maligned @entity211 arguably did the best bit of service for @entity92 from @entity214 to @entity215 when he stood by @entity216 when it seemed after nearly four years - not six months - the wheels appeared to be falling off			0
and the rest , as they say ... if @entity28 is the wrong man now then he was the wrong man in august			0
parish has done a good job in helping turn @entity29 around			1
but if he is not careful he will put the club back into a tail - spin again .			0

@entity0 still *exploring* *possibility* of signing @entity2
@entity19 under pressure at @entity25 after poor start to the season
@entity39 manager @entity36 being lined up to replace @entity19
@entity63 a leading contender for @entity29 manager 's job
@entity85 likely to join @entity76 from @entity88 in the summer
