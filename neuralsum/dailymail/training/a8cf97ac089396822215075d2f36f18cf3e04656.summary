as any parent will tell you , teenagers and their phones are not easily parted			2
take 16 - year - old @entity4 , who dropped her new @entity5 down a drain while walking her dog			1
determined to retrieve it , she climbed into the drain – only to find that she could n’t get out			1
an amused crowd , including her own mother , gathered to watch her struggle before she was eventually freed by firemen			2
the teenager became caught in the storm drain in an attempt to retrieve her phone - the part of the storm drain she picked up apparently weighed 22 kg firefighters rescued the girl from the drain near her home less than 10 minutes after receiving the call after unsuccessful attempts from friends and family , as well as many , many cameraphone pictures , firefighters were eventually called to hoist her out @entity31 shortly after regaining her freedom			1
the teenager is completely unhurt but the phone is ruined emergency services had to be called and , luckily , it was a quick rescue			1
@entity38 received the call at 7.17pm and by 7.26pm , miss @entity37 was free			1
these photographs , taken by an eye witness , show two firefighters grabbing her arms and hauling her to safety while another watches on			1
the girl 's mother , @entity37 , 36 , dashed to the scene and then dialled 999 and three firefighters turned up to gently pull the red - faced schoolgirl free			1
miss @entity37 , a gcse student at @entity51 , had only had bought the phone two weeks ago on a contract			1
she said : ' i was talking to somebody and i went to put my phone in my pocket and it fell down the drain			1
' i thought to myself ' i 'm not leaving this ' and i jumped down to get it			2
' i was n't really even stuck , i just need somebody to help lift me out but my mum got all panicky			1
' when they pulled me out i ran straight home and jumped in the bath			0
i think it was just water but i was n't taking any chances			0
@entity4 - @entity69 , 16 , managed to squeeze down the small drain on her street in @entity72 , @entity38 ' i was just laughing the whole time , i have seen the funny side of it			1
you just have to laugh along with it			0
' there have been a few nasty comments about me being fat which is n't nice but i 'm trying not to take it to heart			0
' taxi operative @entity37 , who also has an eight - year - old son @entity83 , said : ' i was really worried			1
my face went white and i was in a panic			0
@entity31 had to hoist off the heavy drain cover to climb down , she said even at the time she saw the funny side ' i was scared she might sink			1
' i ran out the house , turned the corner - but as soon as i saw her i burst out laughing			1
' i thought ' we are never going to get her out of there ' so i called the fire service who got there pretty quickly			1
' we are going to have to replace the phone but i 'm not too angry			1
worst case scenario is she ends up with an old @entity101			0
' she is never going to live this down now			0
we will be bringing it out at her 18th birthday and her wedding			0
' but worse things can happen then getting stuck in a drain			1
' a firefighter from @entity72 fire station said : ' she was trying to retrieve her @entity5 that she dropped down there			1
it 's very unusual ! i hear a few people have taken pictures			1
' the drain cover and a pair of red wellies and a towel , understood to belong to the teenager , were next to the drain			1
the photos of the incident have been posted on @entity122 and @entity123 and have since gone viral on the social networking sites			0
the girl was not injured but a friend posted on @entity122 that the phone was ' ruined '			2
the unlucky teen is not the first person to become stuck somewhere most people would n't dare tread			2
pushing the bounds of ingenuity , people are getting themselves jammed in ever more elaborate places			0
1 ) who can forget @entity137 on the zip wire ? at an event in @entity140 's @entity142 back in august 2012 , the mayor of @entity140 was whizzing along the contraption in a bid to promote the @entity145			1
however , his best laid plans went awry when he became stranded halfway along the 1,000ft wire			0
embracing the homour of the situation , @entity137 meekly waved two @entity150 while waiting for a ladder to inelegantly help him back to the ground			2
commenting on the incident at the time , @entity153 said : ' if any other politician anywhere in the world was stuck on a zip - wire it would be a disaster			1
for @entity137 , it ’s an absolute triumph			0
' 2 ) @entity163 arcade machines are notoriously difficult to win a prize from			0
however , while most children simply accept their frustration , three - year - old @entity165 decided to take matters into his own hands while on a family holiday to @entity171 in 2008			1
@entity165 was having no luck snagging a teddy with the machine 's mechanical arm but , in the spirit of holiday , his mother went to change a £ 20 note so her son could try again			2
but , while her back was turned , @entity165 managed to wriggle his way into the machine through the prize flap and get his hands on the bear			2
his joy was short - lived , however , as he quickly realised that getting out would n't be so easy			1
to make matters worse , the arcade owner could n't find his keys and it was half an hour before he managed to free to boy			0
at least @entity165 was able to hold onto the bear			0
3 ) one prankster in @entity195 , @entity196 , saw his joke get out of hand in june 2013 , when he managed to squeeze himself inside a traffic bollard in a bid to make his friends laugh			0
unable to squirm out in the same way , he wandered along the high street for two hours before police turned up and managed to yank him free			0
unable to hide his relief , the man said ' thank you so much ' to the officers who finally rescued him			0
speaking at the time , an eyewitness said : ' it was very random , it ’s not the usual thing you see in the middle of @entity195 on a sunday lunchtime			0
i came out of @entity218 and this man had the bollard stuck on his head			2
' i had seen him walking with it on top of his head five minutes earlier , but now it was pulled right down			0
' no - one was helping him because they thought he was just messing around			2
' 4 ) many a person has found themselves caught up while trying to untangle a washing line but it 's a more select group who can do the same with a clothes horse			2
student @entity234 , 18 , became so caught up in hers , however , she was forced to call out the fire brigade to rescue her			0
the student at the @entity238 admitted she was playing around just before the incident occurred in november 2011			0
she accidentally knocked over the clothes horse and it collapsed onto her , trapping her head and shoulders between its joints			0
posting on @entity122 after the drama was all over , miss @entity234 wrote : ' having four hunky firemen and two paramedics come to my rescue ! what a way to spend a sunday night			0
i feel like i ’ve been stuck in a clothes horse for an hour ! '			2
