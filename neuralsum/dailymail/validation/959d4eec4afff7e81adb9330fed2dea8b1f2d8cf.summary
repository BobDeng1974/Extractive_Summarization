families face a raft of price hikes from this week , with increases due in council tax , water bills , vehicle exise duty , @entity20 charges , stamps and even @entity23 television packages ( picture posed by model ) inflation is currently 0 per cent and is predicted to show a minus figure for march and april			1
the collapse in the cost of oil and petrol in the past year by around 50 per cent has had a dramatic impact on living standards - with prime minister @entity42 saying it has given families an extra £ 20 per week - while a supermarket price war has delivered savings on food			1
but many people have reason to dread the rising bills that will be arriving on their doormats and email inboxes over the coming weeks , many of which are being hiked by government departments and agencies			1
@entity56 , editor in chief of advice website money.co.uk , said : ‘ whilst we ca n’t ignore the fact that some of our living costs are going down , such as food and mortgage rates , others are still going up			0
‘ it really worries me that so much talk of 0 per cent inflation will make consumers sit on their hands in the false sense of security that prices for everything will remain static			1
‘ regardless of the economic terminology , consumers still need to save money wherever they can to accommodate rising costs in some areas of their finances			0
’ the average council tax bill for a @entity83 property will go up by £ 16 a year to £ 1,484 from tomorrow , yet local authorities are still warning of massive cuts to services			1
funding for arts , museums and libraries is on the chopping block , while support for home care for the elderly is also being squeezed			0
the @entity20 dental charge payable for a band one course of treatment , something like a filling , will increase by 30p from £ 18.50 to £ 18.80 ( picture posed by models ) for those who live in particularly valuable homes , new property taxes could be a sign of things to come with @entity108 and the @entity109 going into the @entity110 with proposals to hit owners of expensive homes			2
the @entity109 want a new annual ‘ mansion tax ’ on homes worth more than £ 2million , while @entity108 has proposed something similar in a policy that has angered some within the party , ranging from @entity118 to mp @entity119			2
@entity122 are angry at the prospect of money being raised from families in the @entity126 through the new property tax to subsidise services , such as the @entity20 , in @entity129			1
water bills will go up by an average of £ 5 a year to £ 401 for the average household from tomorrow as privatised firms continue to soak customers while paying millions to their , mostly foreign , shareholders			2
also going up tomorrow is car tax , with @entity137 ( @entity137 ) set to increase by up to £ 10 for some categories of vehicles , particularly larger cars with big engines and higher carbon emissions			2
for example , the first year @entity137 rate for a band l car , such as an @entity145 or @entity146 , will go up from £ 860 to £ 870			0

band 2 treatment goes up by 80p to £ 51.30 and band 3 by £ 3.50 to £ 222.50			0

yesterday , the cost of a simple first class stamp went up by a penny to 64p and second class rose by 1p to 54p			0
for larger items , the price of a large letter first class stamp up to 100g rose by 2p to 95p and the price of a large letter second class stamp up to 100g increased by 1p to 74p			0
and this is not the end of the pain			0
