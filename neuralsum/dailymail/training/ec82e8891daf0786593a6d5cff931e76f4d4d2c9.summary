three years ago to the day , i crashed to the ground with severe acute pancreatitis			1
to mark a diagnosis of diabetes , and being in @entity6 for the holidays , i drank several beakers of single malt , plus a few bottles of burgundy , and the next thing i remember a student nurse was inserting a catheter the size of a hosepipe up what in a @entity19 dictionary would be called my ‘ organ of generation ’			1
i was in the hospital ’s high dependency unit for three weeks and received a ‘ get well ’ card from film director @entity25 and his actress wife @entity26			1
they ’d mistaken @entity28 for @entity29			1
suffice it to say , i have been teetotal since december 2011			1
i ’ve got used to it – i have reverted to my ancestral roots and become a frowning and disapproving @entity35 puritan			2
@entity36 : @entity28 meets actress @entity37 during his stint in panto one thing i no longer do , come @entity41 , is go to parties			1
what you realise , being on the water - wagon , is how boring other people become when they are drunk or getting drunk			2
by staying at home i also deny journalist @entity48 the chance to turn her back on me – she really did that after i was rude about her in a review			2
silly me , i thought she ’d have been used to it			2
despite the boozelessness , i adore @entity41 more than ever			1
as with supermarkets , which start playing @entity58 and @entity59 carols , it begins for me in november , my first mince pie going down the hatch round about @entity62			2
i love the nights drawing in , the cold			2
except it seldom is cold			2
more of a muggy drizzle			2
i live in @entity67 , @entity68 , which is pretty much unchanged since @entity70 ’s day – an attractively seedy town with spooky cobbled alleys and yellow fogs coming off the @entity74			2
we have poulterers and muffin men			2
as there ’s never real snow , however , machines spray the crowds with flecks of foam			0
the townsfolk ca n’t wait to get into their mr @entity86 costumes and walk up and down selling chestnuts and mulled wine			0
tickets for the cathedral ’s carol services have been sold out for months			0
i ’ve never had any luck finding a white @entity41 , sad to report			1
i went to @entity93 and it rained			0
i went to the @entity95 @entity94 and there was a heatwave			0
i watched @entity41 yet again last week – and there ’s no snow in that either , until the very end , when it is plainly a @entity102 studio set			1
what this indicates is what a massive fabrication the whole glittery season is – a big cynical excuse for a commercial orgy , an eating orgy , but probably not an orgy orgy as everyone is too stupefied to want to be bothered with any of that and too pie - eyed to know whom to address scented thank - you notelets to afterwards			0
nonetheless , i am a sucker for the theatricality ( ie the kitsch ) of @entity41			1
not only are my halls decked with boughs of holly , my tree is a death - trap			0
i ’ve never mastered the art of getting it to remain vertical so it tilts alarmingly , the coloured lights popping and fizzing on their frayed cord			0
i send out more than a hundred cards			0
i get about 20 back , mostly from school pals i have not clapped eyes on for 40 years who insist on enclosing their boastful round - robins : ‘ i was invited by @entity135 , ’ said one , ‘ to the @entity137 at @entity138 , @entity139			1
’ my social highlight in 2014 was seeing @entity141 in the gents at the @entity143			0
in little women , one of the monstrous moppets says that @entity41 would n’t be @entity41 without any presents			1
for me , @entity41 would n’t be @entity41 without the telly			1
for weeks now i have been munching @entity150 chocolate reindeers as i watch absolutely terrible seasonal films on @entity152			0
there are heaps of them – all the same : @entity156 and mrs @entity157 incognito in an old folk ’s home ; single mums finding romance over the eggnog ; hedge - fund bankers mending their @entity165 - like ways ; divorcees in novelty knitwear getting reconciled			0
on some cable channel or other , @entity169 has been stuffing his birds for ages , @entity168 is licking her beaters endlessly , and over at @entity178 ‘ sprouts are given a new lease of life by @entity177 ’			0
since going teetotal @entity28 enjoys @entity41 ' more than ever ' it is not that programmes are recycled – they are in a loop			1
@entity37 and @entity183 , the original goggleboxers , are always swearing and being coarse ; @entity185 and @entity186 , the @entity187 @entity188 , are forever eating @entity41 dinner , as is @entity191 ’s vicar of @entity192			1
@entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 have a never - ending series of cases to crack			0
@entity200 to all the actors who are raking in the repeat fees ! it ’s easy enough to sneer at @entity41 and be curmudgeonly , but i was n’t impressed when a friend in @entity206 , a genuine @entity165 who keeps unused boiled water in a flask next to the kettle , told me he and his wife liked nothing more than to go for a walk on christmas day , staring in through people ’s windows at families falling out			1
for there are good things to be had at @entity41 – love , warmth , nostalgia – not just the chance to be superior by observing greed or mocking sentimental claptrap			1
for example , this year there will be a round - up of my children , who , when they were n’t being told by the doctors in @entity6 that ‘ there ’s a chance that your father may still be with us at @entity41 ’ , have been abroad in more recent years , breaking down in a @entity236 camper van in @entity237 , for example , or earning a crust in a travelling circus			1
my son the clown , by the way , has been doing a stint in a red suit as @entity156 this past month in a garden centre near @entity247 , @entity248			0
he gets seven minutes off each hour when the elf does a magic show			0
actually , one of the reasons my sons will be descending is that they have been dumped by their girlfriends , so @entity255 and @entity256 will foot the bill for the sad loners ’ wassailing			0
now i do n’t drink , what i do to create that special atmosphere of well - being is eat , so i am happy to be in charge of the feasts			0
the smell of cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg and candied peel will waft about like nobody ’s business			0
on the menu will be carp or pike simmered in beer and gingerbread , small parcels of pasta containing chopped pork marinated in marsala , venison served with juniper berries and poached pears , plus the traditional free - range turkey and the @entity41 pudding from @entity285 ’s			1
if i run out of brandy butter , i ’ve always wanted to try to replicate @entity288 ’s invention of vodka margarine – though saying this , it suddenly occurs to me that the alcohol in all these recipes may very well kill me			0
what a way to go			0
l @entity28 ’s book @entity296 is being adapted for the screen by @entity298 .			1

he has been teetotal since december 2011 and no longer goes to parties
