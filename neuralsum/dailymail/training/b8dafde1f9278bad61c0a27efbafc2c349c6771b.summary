victim : @entity7 ( laying down in front ) was unable to work for eight weeks after the attack on him in a @entity5 park in a statement he said : ‘ as someone who has worked in pretty rough schools teaching dance i feel for them and i hope they can get themselves sorted out			1
i do n’t have any feelings of revenge			2
‘ i ’m just pleased there ’s no lasting effects and i ’m back at work			1
it was a sickening attack and i ’m thrilled it ’s all over			2
it saved a lot of trouble and heartache for everyone that they all pleaded guilty			2
that was a big comfort			2
‘ everything happened so fast so it ’s really lucky there were witnesses			0
it was half way over before i knew what was going on so i would not have been much of a help			0
my daughter is 15 and she was very upset to see my injuries and what happened			0
@entity16 ( looking at camera ) outside @entity12 where he was jailed for two years @entity16 ( left ) shows respect for the law by turning up in a grey tracksuit at @entity12 where he was jailed for two years for a vicious mugging ‘ we ’re just relieved it ’s over and we can move on with our lives			1
it was a traumatic experience			0
it has taken me a long time to feel comfortable on the streets again			0
i was a bit afraid of even a pigeon flying nearby			0
it does feel like i can close the book on it			0
‘ it was the frustration at having to see them unzip my suitcase and go through it			2
my front teeth were badly damaged and i am still receiving treatment with an estimated cost of £ 900			0
‘ i have a scratch to the left cornea which has meant five different hospital visits			0
that ’s had the most impact on my daily life as i have been unable to work for 7 to 8 weeks and had to wear an eye patch and dark glasses			1
even now i ’m quite nervous when out and it ’s difficult because i ’m usually a confident guy			0
’ within minutes the three muggers had struck again , this time attacking @entity121 , 52 , a postman on his delivery round			1
one of the three shouted : ‘ let ’s do him			0
lads ! ’ and he was then subjected to a ‘ frenzied ’ attack , being kicked and punched while curled up in a ball before his attackers left with his postbag			2
mr @entity121 , a postman for 11 years , has felt unable to go out on rounds again following the attack , suffers anxiety attacks and his victim impact statement said that the robbery had a ‘ massive effect ’ on his personality			1

@entity16 , a father - of - two , had numerous previous convictions , as did @entity17 , including a conviction aged 13 for a robbery involving a knife			2
@entity18 had never been in trouble before			0
the court heard all three had been drinking and taking cocaine at an all - night party and could remember little if anything of the robberies			1
@entity8 where mr @entity7 was attacked jailing @entity16 and @entity17 , recorder @entity160 told them : ‘ this is not just a tragedy for you but a tragedy for your family and friends and it is one you have brought upon them			1
my judgement is that each of these offences was very if not the most serious of robberies - made the more serious by the fact there were two robberies on two victims within a few minutes of each other			2
‘ i have no doubt drink and drugs played a part in what you did but the fact of the matter is it does n’t matter to him whether you were drunk or had been taking cocaine or anything else			1
‘ what matters to him is that he was set upon and violently assaulted			0
i think that this is not a tragedy for you but it is a tragedy for your family and friends and one that you have brought on them and i hope you all finally see sense			0
’ defending father - of - two @entity16 , @entity199 said : ‘ he has not drunk alcohol since the offences			2
no real forethought went into this			0
’ for @entity17 , @entity215 : ‘ his memory of the incident is non-existent			2
it was a brave thing to enter his plea			0
a guilty plea is the ultimate expression of remorse			0
he has gcses and has qualified in football coaching			0
a hooded top is the uniform of youth not a form of disguise			0
