@entity0 said consent must be considered in rape cases even if given when ' blind drunk ' a senior barrister has caused outrage after saying that men should be cleared of rape if a female victim claimed to be too drunk to consent to sex			1
in a blog entitled she was gagging for it , @entity0 , 71 , condemned new @entity14 guidelines which put the onus on men to seek explicit consent from drunken partners			1
the married father - of - four made a point of referring to women in rape cases as ‘ complainants ’ rather than victims , and said the guidelines could result in ‘ everything possible in the trial process ’ being ‘ bent towards the conviction of the accused ’			1
mr @entity0 wrote : ‘ consent is consent , blind drunk or otherwise , and regret after the event can not make it rape			1
i have a simple solution			0
‘ if the complainant ( i do not refer to her as the victim ) was under the influence of alcohol or drugs , or both , when she was “ raped ” , this provides the accused with a complete defence			2
end of story and a victory for fairness , moderation and common sense ! ’ ‘ my considerable experience tells me that there are basically two defences to an allegation of rape : either “ it was n’t me gov ” , or “ she was gagging for it ”			2
’ the blog has prompted a furious response from victims ’ organisations and rape victims			1
his remarks were also condemned as ‘ simply wrong ’ by the leading barrister in the area where mr @entity0 operates			1
in media interviews over the weekend mr @entity0 said rape statistics would fall if women who ‘ trollop around with their t * ts out ’ stopped getting ‘ legless ’ and ‘ covered up ’			1
he claimed women who dress provocatively ‘ send out certain signals ’ and give ‘ lads the opportunity to think , “ she looks like a goer ”			2
’ mr @entity0 made the controversial comments in a blog post titled ' she was gagging for it ' on his website yesterday mr @entity0 told the @entity81 he believed the ‘ government and prosecution service are going too far the other way ’			1
speaking at the large bungalow he shares with wife @entity86 , 63 , in @entity87 , @entity88 , he added : ‘ it does happen where the girl says she ’s up for it – she wants a quickie – and then it is unpleasant and torrid and terrible			0
‘ there are no violins playing , it ’s round the back of the community centre			0
the next morning she wakes up and feels ashamed			0
it ’s very easy for her to convince herself that she did not actually consent			0
’ last month , the @entity14 announced that new guidance on rape cases and the issue of consent would be issued to police forces			2
@entity107 , the @entity108 , said : ‘ consent to sexual activity is not a grey area – in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely			2
‘ we want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue – how did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly ? ’ but mr @entity0 – nicknamed the barrister @entity121 after once delivering his final speech to a trial jury entirely in verse – said : ‘ my experience says that the jury gives the evidence the attention it requires and if they are sure then they convict			1
we do n’t need to manipulate the system for rape witnesses			0
’ @entity107 , the @entity108 , said sexual consent was not a ' grey area ' mr @entity0 worked as a criminal defence barrister for almost 40 years and was last involved in a rape trial three years ago			1
he is a member of the @entity138 of barristers and now concentrates on civil law			0
his blog has been roundly condemned			0
@entity142 , director of @entity143 , said : ‘ i find it hard to believe this is not a sick joke			0
he is suggesting the opposite of the law			0
’ @entity150 , of campaign group @entity151 , said : ‘ he is saying that men are incapable of controlling their own urges when they see a woman in a short skirt			2
’ @entity156 , leader of the @entity138 , said : ‘ i have spoken to @entity0 and told him that i consider his blog to be offensive			1
‘ most of what he says is simply wrong			1
the views he articulates are not remotely representative of barristers who prosecute and defend these cases in practice			0
’ one victim , a 45 - year - old female jogger who was abducted and repeatedly raped at knife - point by a career criminal out on licence from prison , said : ‘ rape is rape , when a woman or a man does not give consent for sex to occur despite the fact that drugs or alcohol have been consumed			1
‘ if a man or woman takes advantage of the opposite sex in this reduced state of awareness , it is a predatory action			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s blog is written under the masthead ‘ witty , incisive comment on the law today ’			2
last night he planned to republish an edited version of the controversial blog entry – after being warned by the circuit that the original piece may be considered to bring the profession into disrepute if it remained online			0
a @entity194 spokesman declined to comment .			0
