by @entity0 @entity1 scored the goal that won @entity3 the 2010 @entity7 but @entity8 was just as important in that victory over @entity10 , particularly the one - on - one save he made from @entity4 that the winger recently admitted still gives him nightmares			1
it ’s safe to say @entity4 achieved at least a little redemption as @entity3 collapsed in @entity13 , the fleet of foot @entity15 starring in a four - goal second - half blitz			1
for @entity8 though , it was just the latest instalment in a tragedy that has seen him lose the no 1 spot at his beloved @entity23 and teeter on the brink of doing so at international level			1
for so long @entity8 has been the bedrock of the @entity3 national side			2
now he looks like a weak link			0
the night could have gone so differently for a man once referred to as ‘ @entity8 ’ back home in @entity23			2
after keeping four consecutive clean sheets in the knockout stages of @entity3 ’s successful @entity7 campaign in 2010 , before kick - off against @entity55 was 85 minutes from breaking the all - time record for most consecutive minutes without conceding at @entity57			1
as it happened he got to within 41 minutes of passing @entity61 ’s 1990 milestone of 517 – before another @entity43 player , @entity62 , shattered his dream with an outrageous lobbed header right before the break to cancel out @entity67 ’s earlier penalty			0
legend : @entity8 was close to setting a record for longest time without conceding at a @entity7 next generation : but now his future is in doubt with @entity42 waiting in the wings to replace him there was nothing @entity8 could do about that unique finish from @entity78 , but it was a completely different story in the second - half			1
@entity4 ’s goal early in the second - half , @entity10 ’s second of the evening , took a slight deflection off @entity3 centre - back @entity84 but @entity8 was well - positioned to stop the strike			1
the ball looped over his legs and @entity10 were ahead			0
then in the 64th minute @entity8 was at fault for the third @entity15 goal , making a mess of a free - kick from the left by parrying the ball on to @entity93 who bundled home from a yard or so out			2
and @entity10 ’s fourth was all @entity8 ’ making			2
@entity84 slipped a straightforward backpass to him inside the @entity3 box but his first touch was woeful , allowing @entity78 to nick the ball away and prod it over the line			0
ten minutes from the end it was time for @entity4 ’s revenge			0
the sight of @entity8 , on his 154th international appearance , scrambling to stop the former @entity108 attacker after he jinked past him will linger in the memory			0
@entity4 easily evaded @entity8 , who lost his footing as he tried to change direction , before the flying @entity15 set himself and fired past the recovering @entity3 defence			1
the worrying thing for @entity3 is that this flapping , uncertain @entity8 is not a new development			2
dropped : @entity8 lost his place at @entity23 under @entity117 continuation : @entity119 only played @entity8 in cup games in favour : @entity122 was the man to replace @entity8 between the sticks at the @entity124 but for @entity84 ’ game - saving header deep into injury time at the end of the @entity129 final , @entity23 would have lost to city rivals @entity131 and @entity8 would have been to blame			1
his decision to sprint from his line and try to gather @entity135 ’s looping header was a colossal error of judgement , as the ball bounced over him and over the line to give @entity131 a surprise lead			0
@entity28 , in contrast , was a rare ray of light in an otherwise bleak season for @entity43			0
he made very few mistakes over the course of an ill - fated campaign , as many around him struggled for form			0
after rising through the ranks at @entity8 ’ club enemies @entity131 and captaining the @entity3 under - 21 side @entity28 made the switch to @entity153 in 2011			1
and despite a rocky start to life in the @entity156 he has since established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the country , if not @entity160			0
it has been a tough 18 months for @entity8			0
dropped by former real manager @entity117 in favour of @entity122 , the 33 - year - old has flittered in and out of the team since			1
he played in most of the cup fixtures under @entity119 this season , but featured just twice in @entity167			0
with only nine international minutes under his belt – he made his debut in a @entity7 warm - up friendly against @entity13 on june 8 – it would be a gamble to start @entity28 , but in the wake of @entity8 ’ latest error - strewn display it could just be one that would pay off for @entity3 boss @entity38 .			1

@entity8 looked shaky as @entity3 lost 5 - 1 to @entity10 in @entity7
@entity8 lost his starting spot at @entity23 under @entity117
@entity119 continued to favour @entity122 in goal this season
@entity8 captained @entity3 to @entity7 glory in @entity34 four years ago
@entity43 goalkeeper @entity42 could replace @entity8
