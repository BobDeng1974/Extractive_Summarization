@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and sir @entity3 at the @entity5 party say what you like about sir @entity3 , but he certainly knows how to throw a party			1
for years , his annual @entity10 and @entity11 ball — held at his opulent @entity5 mansion in @entity13 , to raise money for his @entity15 — has been one of the social events of the season			1
now , having apparently been scrapped because of an influx of ‘ @entity21 ’ , the event was reborn on thursday night as the @entity22			2
@entity23 was there , along with an eclectic selection of sir @entity3 and @entity0 ’s chums , including comedian @entity28 , actor sir @entity29 and designer @entity30			1
so what went on in @entity13 ? who is the millionaire who paid £ 50,000 to kiss @entity23 ? and why was @entity0 the big talking point of the night ? here come the d - @entity35 not everyone who came to the £ 3,000 - a - ticket event in the grounds of sir @entity3 ’s lavish home was in the superstar bracket			1
male model @entity41 — who turns up at parties all over town — was there , as was socialite @entity45 , who pronounced herself knocked out by the ‘ festival vibe ’ of the party			2
@entity49 actor @entity48 also scored an invite , as did @entity51 , the daughter of crooner @entity52 , who is known mainly for winning @entity53 way back in 2003			2
higher up the celebrity food chain , sir @entity3 played host to @entity28 and his supermodel wife , @entity56 , and also comedian @entity58 and his girlfriend @entity57			1
@entity59 was in attendance , too			2
in previous years , sir @entity3 has welcomed such luminaries as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 as well as former @entity66 president @entity65 and the @entity67			1
the lack of big - hitters this year , it seems , was mainly down to timing			0
at this point in the calendar , the @entity73 crowd are in @entity76 for the film festival , while the fashionistas are in the @entity79 for @entity80			0
the venue sir @entity3 bought @entity5 in 1975 and his staff have been known to mutter that it ’s bigger than nearby @entity84 , with eight bedrooms , a billiards room , 30 acres and a squash court			1
as @entity3 himself shrugs : ‘ one queen living next door to another			1
’ the spectacular estate boasts a @entity94 terrace , @entity96 gardens , a secret garden and a white scented garden			0
indeed , the gardens are so big that guests were offered a tour by rickshaw			0
there were some grumbles that there were n’t quite enough rickshaws to go around , though , and there were also long queues for the lavatories			0
at the start of the evening , sir @entity3 and @entity28 came out to mingle with their two sons , born to a surrogate mother			1
@entity1 , nearly four , and @entity2 , 20 months , are regulars at their fathers parties @entity116 , @entity58 , @entity0 , @entity56 , sir @entity3 and @entity28 at the party the small talk at the start of the evening , sir @entity3 and @entity28 came out to mingle with their two sons , born to a surrogate mother			1
@entity1 , nearly four , and @entity2 , 20 months , are regulars at their fathers ’ parties and have also been wheeled out at sir @entity3 ’s @entity125 bash			1
they were wearing matching £ 95 canvas shoes in the classic @entity129 check and little @entity2 kept a tight grasp of his @entity132 toy throughout			1
a guest says they stayed at the event for around an hour before being taken off to bed at 8.30pm			0
apparently they are sir @entity3 ’s only topic of conversation now , and he chatted about them to all the guests all night , from potty training to his choice of schools			1
very un-rock ’ n ’ roll			0
@entity146 @entity0 ’s muscular physique was the talk of the party			2
he posted pictures to his @entity152 account recently showing some impressive muscles , a result of serious iron pumping			0
he has also allowed his hair to go grey			0
he was very much the social powerhouse at the party and circulated with a determination to speak to every guest			2
@entity3 , known for being a little reticent on social occasions , was said to be ‘ a bit quiet , but @entity28 was on fine form ’ , said a guest			1
bow ties were banned at the event attended by @entity169 ( next to @entity0 , left ) , @entity41 @entity23 , @entity170 and @entity171 the @entity172 no more white tie — the dress code this year was ‘ summer chic ’			1
this translated as the usual red - carpet dresses for the ladies , and lounge suits for the men			0
@entity28 channelled the @entity180 look in a pink jacket			1
@entity3 donned a midnight - blue tuxedo with a long platinum chain , and — ever flamboyant — some hand - made sparkly shoes , thought to be by @entity66 husband - and - wife designers @entity186 and @entity187 , and costing an eye - watering £ 10,000 a pair			1
the @entity190 sir @entity3 remained true to his favourite florist @entity193 , who favours gigantic displays of spectacular and immaculate flowers			1
@entity193 knows sir @entity3 will not tolerate chrysanthemums , carnations or lilies at any price			1
he has been decorating sir @entity3 ’s parties for decades and did the flowers for his civil partnership to @entity0 in 2005			1
he garlanded the statues in the garden with stunning displays of roses and hydrangeas			0
@entity208 and @entity209 there were masses of champagne and @entity214 vodka cocktails , while staff seemed to have been told to refill glasses after three sips			0
they also offered to mix any drinks that were requested			0
dinner was a rather unadventurous affair of smoked salmon , followed by chicken with grilled vegetables and then fruit tart			0
the costly kiss @entity23 kisses @entity226 after he paid £ 50,000 to the @entity227 in an auction during the @entity229 to kiss the actress for 10 seconds @entity226 is a 27 - year - old investment banker and son of @entity232 , who founded the @entity234 and @entity235 investment bank after dinner , the serious business of fundraising got under way			2
@entity23 , who has attended every @entity3 summer party since 2001 , flew in from @entity241 , where she has been filming , to support him			1
she is best friends with both @entity3 , 67 , and @entity0 , 51 , a film - maker — @entity3 gave her away at her wedding to @entity244 and the pair are godparents to her son , @entity247			1
@entity226 , a 27 - year - old investment banker , won the lot of a kiss with @entity23 , paying a staggering £ 50,000 for his ten - second grapple			2
those who were there contend that the actress was very game about it , but kept her teeth firmly clenched just in case			0
@entity258 is the son of @entity232 , who founded the @entity234 and @entity235 investment bank			0
he is the @entity261 of the @entity262 and lives in @entity263 with his wife , @entity265 , and their three children			2
to give some idea of his wealth , he bought a $ 5.5 million holiday home in @entity271 , which he spent $ 3 million renovating , but is selling it again because it ’s too much effort to visit it			0
he told me : ‘ my father and i were kindly invited by the amazing people at @entity276 , so i would extend a special thanks to them if given the opportunity			0
‘ and the kiss — well , i have had a crush on @entity23 since i was about eight years old , and we noticed they were trying to get people excited to donate			0
i joked to my father that it would be funny if i made a big donation in exchange for a kiss with @entity23			2
‘ and , before i knew it , @entity290 had whisked me over to her asking if she would be cool with that , which she kindly was , and all of a sudden i was standing on the stage with @entity3 who was announcing the contribution and kiss			2
the entire thing was a unique “ once - in - a - lifetime ” experience for me — and , of course , the kiss was amazing ! ‘ i would like to thank @entity23 for being a good trouper			0
as a very happily married man , i would also add that my wife , who is back in @entity263 , loved the entire story			0
’ singing for supper entertainment was provided by @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity170			0
afterwards , celebrity dj @entity311 opened a pop - up nightclub with dancers and a spectacular light show until 1am			0
@entity3 is not one for dancing , but his partner was on the dance floor with @entity309 until the bitter end .			2

annual party previously known as @entity10 and @entity321 made a *comeback*
*reinvented* as @entity324 with summer chic *dresscode*
sir @entity3 and @entity28 came out to mingle with sons @entity1 , 4 , and @entity2
the children wore matching £ 95 canvas shoes in classic @entity129 check
