laughing and joking : @entity13 ( c ) , 26 , walks with her lawyers to the immigration hearing in @entity29 today but miss @entity13 was really targeted because she had ‘ many similarities ’ with @entity2 , a deportation tribunal heard			1
this is because both @entity8 were ‘ young , attractive and adept networkers ’			0
miss @entity13 admits having an affair with @entity35 , 65 , the mp for @entity37 and a then member of the commons defence select committee			1

as well as having an affair with mr @entity35 , miss @entity13 admits being sexually involved with an unnamed @entity53 official			1
@entity54 , for @entity55 , said these two affairs were ‘ the crux of the security services case against her ’			0

spy links : miss @entity13 was compared to her compatriot @entity2 , and it was said that it would not be obvious that either worked for @entity8 intelligence similarities : @entity2 was likened to @entity55 because they were both ' young and adept networkers ' @entity47 said she was familiar with the @entity2 case in the @entity4 she said : ‘ the security services case is there are similarities but not by any means the same			1

’ mr @entity101 said : ‘ the difference is the @entity77 has got some evidence			0
yes ? ’ the @entity6 officer replied : ‘ i ’m unable to disclose what is in the closed case , but there is a closed case			0
