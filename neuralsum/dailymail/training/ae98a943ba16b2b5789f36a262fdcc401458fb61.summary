' in an interview the woman said : ' he grabbed the back of my head by the hair and pushed my face in his private parts and started moving			1
i could n't get up			2
' i was probably only down there a couple of seconds but it felt a lot longer			1
i was angry and embarrassed and ashamed			2
he 'd done it front of people , and just the fact he thought it was alright to do that			2
i remember being angry at myself for being upset			2
' prosecutor @entity56 told the court how the trouble started on a night out in july 2013 when @entity0 got drunk and picked on the woman at @entity60 while waiting to get a train home			1
he said : ' at some point the defendant appears to have indicated a ticket on the floor			2
he invited her to pick it up			0

' she describes it as humiliating and degrading			0
there was another incident a short while he put his hand behind her			0
he accepts there was some boisterous horseplay and the first incident was a laddish prank			0
' describing the second attack the woman said : ' i remember he did it with a lot of force and that it was painful			1
it sounds really stupid , but he did it quite fast and in exactly the right place - i remember thinking , how did he know it was there ? ' i was blaming myself for being stupid and decided to get really , really drunk , and it was more or less the day after i was just , really , really upset			2

' they say whatever you are accused of does n't fit the man they know			0
all these people say what you were accused of is out of character			0
but as we do now know : there is another side to @entity0 , which they have not born witness to			1
' i ca n't emphasise enough that when people like you indulge in such conduct , even if you regard it as mild or funny , it is up to the recipient to decide whether that conduct is acceptable or not			0
the problem is that in this situation it is often the recipient that feels they are in the wrong if they are made to feel uncomfortable			0
' they have to think , ' am i making a fuss about nothing ? ' they are made to feel it is their fault because they are lacking a sense of humour and failing to see the funny side			0
' when i came to this courtroom i came ready and prepared to send you to prison			0
i can do so without losing one minute 's sleep as a result			2
' although i think you probably deserve a prison sentence i 'm going to err on the side of hopefully instilling some rehabilitation			0
i think this has really hit you hard , because you are egotistical			0
i think you need to show you are a worthy man and you are not			0
you have escaped prison by a whisker			1
' @entity0 had called character witnesses including a @entity179 pilot , research scientist and a teacher to testify he was a ' pillar of their community ' and a ' really decent man '			1
in court the father - of - two showed jurors the ' forward thrusting motion ' he used to play his prank			2
but he insisted : ' it was a stupid , laddish , impulsive thing - i went ' wahey ' and i may well have put my hand on her head or her neck , i certainly did n't grab her hair			1
i lurched forward towards her face			0
' it was not meant in any way as a sexual assault - i would never do that			1
it was meant as a stupid prank with someone i thought would have just laughed it off			0
i bitterly regret what i did			0
i 'm sorry for what i did and i 'm sorry that i have caused my poor wife to suffer			0
