by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 11 september 2013 burglars should be given longer prison sentences because ' numerous ' criminals just re-offend while on parole , one of @entity3 's top judges said today			1
@entity8 said offenders were being granted parole well before they served half of their sentences and used that time to commit further crimes			1
the outspoken senior judge , who sits at @entity14 , said multiple offenders should be treated in the same way as sex offenders and violent criminals			1
his honour judge @entity8 believes multiple offenders like @entity20 , left , should be treated in the same way as sex offenders and violent criminals he is now demanding the courts are given the option of handing out extended sentences - which currently only apply to serious crimes - to repeat burglars			1
judge @entity8 called for guidelines to be altered to give him powers to jail criminals for longer if they had more than five or six burglaries on their record			2
he said : ' dwelling house burglaries are always serious , especially when the offence is committed at night when the householder is asleep in bed			0
' in such cases there is always the risk of confrontation taking place			0
' in my experience , offenders who commit such offences not infrequently continue to offend after being released from prison			1
@entity46 , where outspoken senior judge @entity47 sits ' i have seen numerous cases of defendants with five , six or seven previous convictions for dwelling house burglary			1
' it is a matter of concern that there have been occasions when such individuals have been granted temporary parole from prison , well before they have served even one half of their sentences , and use that period of release to commit further burglaries			2
' the @entity64 introduced a ' three strikes and you 're out ' policy on domestic burglary with mandatory three - year custodial sentences on the third conviction			0
but sentences are often reduced if the defendant pleads guilty and often they are released after serving just half their sentence			2
judge @entity8 , the @entity75 ' most senior member of the judiciary , is calling for multiple offenders to be forced to apply for parole before being released			1
his comments come after @entity20 , 33 , who had 46 previous convictions burgled a house after leaving prison			1
@entity20 , of no fixed address , was released on parole just 13 months into a four - year sentence but committed several serious burglaries and failed to return to prison			2
he was finally jailed for five years on june 25 this year to run consecutively to the four - year sentence originally imposed in 2012			0
@entity89 inspector @entity88 said he believes burglars should serve more of their first sentence to act as a deterrent			0
he said : ' it 's difficult to say whether releasing a repeat burglar will result in a spike in burglaries			0
' we have an integrated offender management team that manage repeat offenders so the possibility of re-offending is something we are aware of but we do manage it and it has proved successful			0
' however , i would like to see harsher sentencing			0
' if people are committing that many times then that 's five or six different victims and burglars should be given the appropriate sentence to reflect that level of impact			0
' * in 2009 judge @entity8 slammed the @entity114 for taking too long to bring juvenile offenders before the courts .			2

judge @entity118 says multiple offenders should be dealt with in the same way a violent criminals
he claims releasing prisoners half way through their sentences just gives them time to commit further offences
his comments come after the case of @entity20 , 33 , who had 46 previous convictions and burgled another house after leaving prison
