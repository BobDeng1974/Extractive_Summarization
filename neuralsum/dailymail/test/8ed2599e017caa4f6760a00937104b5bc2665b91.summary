what would high fashion adverts look like if the designers used real women , rather than teenage models or celebrity faces , to showcase their latest clothing and beauty lines ? photo stylist @entity8 , from @entity9 , has recreated a series of glossy commercials for her project @entity13			1
the exhibition includes parodies of ads from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
in the images @entity8 has recreated the adverts completely , from the clothes the model wears , to the poses , make - up , hair colour and surroundings			1
' i had the idea in october and we worked on it for two months			2
i have worked in the fashion business as a photo stylist for magazines and advertising for 25 years			2
' so i am the person who has ideas for ad campaigns			0
it was a strange idea for for me to be on the other side of the camera ! ' during the course of her career @entity8 has worked with over 200 different photographers on various campaigns			2
@entity59 : in this image a smiling @entity8 emulates the pose @entity62 adopted for the @entity64 brand @entity19 : the series of pictures took two months to create and @entity8 said it was interesting to be on the other side of the camera @entity8 said that the project helped her to understand her job on a deeper level : ' by changing role i discovered my craft from another angle			1
' she said that she hoped the humour in the images would provide people with the opportunity for , ' laughter and reflection			0
' she told @entity81 : ' i do n’t really see myself			0
you know , like how you do n’t recognize your voice in a telephone message ? ' @entity87 : just like the real life adverts @entity8 's pictures were retouched , for example her eye colour was changed to blue for this @entity87 - inspired shoot @entity20 : @entity8 copied the hair , make - up and poses from the original shots she continued : ' i feel people need a more spiritual approach to life , and good fun			1
i ’m happy to give them that , even if i ’m just making fun of myself			0
' @entity104 the photographer who shot the images said : ' most of the time we look at advertising images without analysis , without fully perceiving the extent that they have been worked on			1
' changed clothes and accessories , digital retouching , skin cleansed , faked decor , body stretched ; it is only when we take a closer look at these images that we get the full measure			0
their apparent simplicity is the result of a huge job			0
' @entity127 : for this shoot only @entity8 's boots were different from those worn by @entity131 in the real thing the brazilian supermodel posed on the floor in this black and white @entity127 advert for the project @entity8 had her hair and make - up professionally styled so that her look completely resembled that of the famous models in the advertising images			2
her make - up was done by @entity143 whilst @entity144 styled her hair			0
and just like the real adverts the images were retouched by @entity147 and worked on by @entity148			0
@entity149 : @entity8 recreates this shot with a similar looking background to the one used in the original @entity153 : @entity8 says that she hopes that her pictures will make people laugh and reflect			1
