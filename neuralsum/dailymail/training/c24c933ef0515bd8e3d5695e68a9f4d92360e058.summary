by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 4 september 2013 sunny - side up ? @entity0 uses the glare coming off the building to cook an egg welcome to the second @entity5			1
just around the corner from here , in @entity9 , in this very week in 1666 , an absent - minded baker , @entity6 , left his buns in the oven for too long — leading to the greatest conflagration the capital has ever seen			2
this time , it ’s absent - minded property developers — @entity16 and @entity17 — whose 525 ft high , 37 - floor building at 20 @entity20 is unintentionally acting as a giant death ray			1
indeed , the laser beam that nearly bisected @entity23 in @entity24 has nothing on this			0
every day over the past week , for two hours from around midday to 2pm , the bright light reflection of the sun has moved slowly across a stretch of pavement in eastcheap — just by the @entity31 , the massive column that marks the spot where the @entity5 began			1
even on a relatively cloudy day like yesterday , it was possible to fry an egg on the pavement where the glare lands			1
i know because i tried it			0
every day , @entity40 hedgefunders race along the pavement to avoid being toasted			1
the problem is that the whole of the sun - facing side of the curved building — known as the @entity48 because its distinctive shape resembles an old - fashioned mobile phone — acts as a mirror as the concave surface focuses all light on a single spot on the ground			1
in the neighbouring @entity57 , they hardly need bother turning on their cookers to heat up their pho noodles			0
in @entity63 ’s grooming , the glare is so intense that it ’s burnt a black disc the size of a saucer into the welcome mat. and anyone unlucky enough to park their car in the bays opposite the building — dubbed the @entity73 by some wags — is in trouble			2
last week , @entity76 , the director of a tiling company , left his @entity78 on eastcheap for just an hour , only to return to find it melted by the heat			0
the panels and wing mirror were buckled , and there was a smell of burning plastic			2
@entity86 , a heating engineer , suffered a similar fate with his @entity89			0
he said : ‘ the van looks a total mess			0
every bit of plastic on the left - hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted , including a bottle of @entity98			1
’ the parking bays have now been suspended by the @entity40 authorities while the developers try to solve the problem			1
particularly in @entity40 in september , when what you ’re expecting is the beginning of soft autumnal light			1
elsewhere in the capital , temperatures are a pleasant enough but unremarkable 25 degrees centigrade in the shade			0
but as i move into the focus of the death ray , i instantly start sweating as my thermometer hurtles through 38 degrees @entity134 — hotter than most places on the @entity136 it is like suddenly being on a massive sunbed			0
stay here any longer and i ’ll be thoroughly tangoed			0
television reporters have rushed here from the hottest parts of the globe — @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 — to cover the phenomenon			0
@entity40 at @entity149 levels of heat ? impossible , surely ! when i leave the thermometer on the shopfront of the @entity155 for a few seconds , the temperature rockets up to the maximum possible , 42 degrees centigrade			1
blinding : the phenomenon takes place in the afternoon on bright days in the @entity40 up close : a camera man films broken slates outside a cafe in @entity40			1
it was reported the tiles had shattered from sunlight reflected by the @entity48 tower a block of butter melts in minutes ; my notebook is too hot to handle ; our photographer ’s flash overheats ; an egg sizzles away in the frying pan i ’ve brought with me			1
the @entity48 is one of the @entity40 ’s most prestigious new developments — one in a series of skyscrapers rising up alongside the @entity179 and the @entity180 on @entity40 ’s sprouting @entity182 cost £ 200 million and is due to be finished next spring			1
before then , though , the developers and @entity185 - born architect @entity184 will have to decommission the death ray			2
‘ we are taking the issue of light reflecting seriously and are looking into the matter as a priority , ’ said a spokesman for @entity17 and @entity188 , who formed a 50:50 joint venture to develop 20 @entity20			2
my eyes ! city workers out for a cigarette pull amusing expressions as they see the light even the fruit suffered : a damaged lemon is seen in the window of a barbers shop in the @entity40 ‘ the phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky			1
it lasts for approximately two hours per day , with initial modelling suggesting that it will be present for approximately two to three weeks			2
‘ we are consulting with local businesses and the @entity40 to address the issue in the short term , while also evaluating longer - term solutions to ensure the issue can not recur in future			1
’ the problem is that they have accidentally designed an incredibly effective heat reflector			0
the building , with its huge bank of windows , does n’t just act like a solar reflector : because that bank of windows is concave on its south - facing facade , it also gathers together the sun ’s rays , bounces them back and concentrates them on a focal point — which happens to be that stretch of pavement on eastcheap			1
dr @entity231 , a solar physicist at @entity233 , says : ‘ people have known about the phenomenon for thousands of years			0
blinding : @entity76 with his @entity78 , which was damaged by bright light reflected down from the tower melted : the wing mirror after it was warped by the extreme heat on a road in the @entity40 damage : the building 's unusual shape is reflecting ultra bright light onto eastcheap in the @entity40 ‘ in the same way that a satellite dish works , the building is a parabolic reflector , collecting solar energy over a vast area and focusing it on a point — and , as a result , you ’re getting massive heat levels			1
’ dr @entity231 has visited the site to assess the issue for himself			0
‘ @entity257 on the shops is being burnt , and i could feel myself boiling , ’ he says			0
‘ the developers might well have considered it but thought it was unlikely to be this bad			0
’ he says the same principle is used to light the @entity265 flame : you take a curved silver surface and the sun heats up the torch to burning point			1
dr @entity231 has been recording temperatures and has registered a high of 92.6 degrees @entity134 , only a few degrees short of water ’s boiling point			0
‘ any hotter and things could be set on fire , ’ says dr @entity231			0
‘ there wo n’t be another @entity5 , but you might well get a small one			0
’ unusual scene : city workers walking on eastcheap feel the heat from the @entity48 building illuminating : a runner jogs past a patch of intense light on the road in the @entity40 as i stand in the direct glare , the heat is agonising			1
remember , too , that the building still has n’t been finished : there ’s a big chunk of windows yet to be installed			2
stare for a second at the gleaming facade and you risk being blinded			0
as the sun moves westward , so the hotspot moves along the eastcheap pavement , scorching a new batch of @entity40 bankers on their way to grab their takeaway lunch			1
how on earth can you stop this mammoth microwave from cooking up more lunchtime workers ? ‘ it is nothing to do with the summer heat , ’ says dr @entity231			0
‘ you could get the same effect in winter			0
‘ it ’s related to the height of the sun , which varies throughout the year , and the moment the sunlight hits the building at the right point			1
’ he says that the answer is to paint the windows with a non-reflective matte surface that absorbs the sun ’s rays			2
or to cover them with slightly speckled material that scatters the solar radiation and does n’t produce a focus			0
alternatively , the whole shape of the building could be redesigned — but that remedy would cost a fortune			2
meanwhile , the developers have announced they will be erecting a temporary scaffold screen at street level to block out the sun ’s rays while they seek a longer - term solution			2
behind the screen , the second @entity5 will continue until the sun stops shining or highly - paid architects start to get a bit smarter about learning their solar physics .			2

even on a relatively cloudy day it was possible to fry an egg on the pavement underneath the @entity48
the sun - facing side of the building acts as a mirror as the concave surface focuses all light on a single spot on the ground
