the @entity0 have chosen a former radical @entity1 to fight for a marginal parliamentary seat			2
@entity3 spent 13 years inside @entity4 ( @entity5 ) , the global @entity1 organisation that first spawned @entity7 , the banned @entity1 terrorist organisation founded by @entity8 and @entity9			1
but he renounced his past and called for a ' secular @entity11 ' six years ago , after serving time in an @entity13 prison			1
@entity3 : the quid pro quo is that when everyone else in society is expected to identify themselves , a @entity16 woman wearing a niqab should not be exempted @entity3 , who was convicted of ' membership of a banned organisation ' and sentenced to serve five years in @entity23 , in @entity13 , has now set up the @entity24 , a counter-extremism think - tank			1
and clearly he has won over the coalition party , who have selected him to contest the north @entity29 constituency of @entity30 and @entity31			2
it is a three - way marginal currently held by @entity34 's @entity33 - who has a slight majority of just 42			2
@entity3 , who gained a law and @entity38 degree from @entity39 and a masters in political theory from the @entity42 , told @entity43 : ' i am looking forward to running for public office			1
the north @entity29 seat is currently held by @entity34 's @entity33 - who has a slight majority of just 42 ' @entity24 will remain a priority for me because its values shape my beliefs and outlook			2
' he wants to run for @entity55 so he can ' practise what he preaches ' the @entity53 reported			0
' i though the time was right to continue the journey and become a manifestation of exactly what @entity60 is arguing - that you can find people who are angry , who oppose many things in the world , but here is no substitute for democratic engagement , ' he said to the newspaper			0
the law graduate was raised in @entity72 in what he described as ' an educated , middle - class and well integrated family '			0
but after experiencing severe and violent racism as a teenager and feeling cut off from mainstream society , the think - tank founder says he was sold @entity1 in the name of @entity11 by a @entity5 preacher , and sucked into a group that encouraged him to ' spout hate '			0
after reflecting on his membership during his imprisonment , the 35 - year - old renounced the group			2
he says that : ' @entity1 uses political grievances to alienate and then provide an alternative sense of belonging to vulnerable young @entity16 '			0
in a recent interview he said : ' preying on the grievances of disaffected young men is the bedrock of @entity1			0
' since renouncing the extreme group , he says the only way to try and prevent radicalisation is to give angry young @entity16 another outlet			0
he founded a youth movement called @entity100 , in @entity101 , which tries to counter extremist ideology through discussion and debate			0
he has called for a similar operation to be set up in @entity106 , to try and pull disaffected muslims from being sucked into extreme organisations			0
a spokesman for mr @entity3 said : my client was imprisoned in @entity13 for a political offence under the former @entity114 government , having been tried by an exceptional court , established under @entity116 that suspended the constitution			1
' moreover , @entity114 â€™s regime and his treatment of political prisoners have since been indisputably condemned by all @entity122 governments and press			1
' because of the circumstances under which he was imprisoned , mr @entity3 was adopted by @entity125 as a prisoner of conscience			1
' finally , mr @entity3 is now one of the fiercest critics of @entity1 in general , and of his former group @entity4 in particular			1

@entity3 was convicted by ' the now *disgraced* @entity114 regime '
@entity3 insists he renounced extremism six years ago and was *supported* by @entity125 when in prison
