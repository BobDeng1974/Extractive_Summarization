these cards were usually printed out from vending machines at amusement arcades but the battalion of females were not living , breathing , flash and blood			0
instead they were pin - ups that bolstered the morale of @entity45 troops wrenched from their homes and sent to barrack rooms to tackle the enemy			1
the most famous was ' @entity49 ' , the cartoon heroine who boosted morale during the @entity51 and other troubled times by removing her clothes			0
the blonde bombshell , who was drawn in the @entity55 , became a national treasure and was reputedly painted on the first @entity45 armored vehicle ashore on @entity58 in june 1944			0
