by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 14 february 2013 a drunk prankster has been caught on video going for a swim - in a hotel 's tropical fish tank			1
the intoxicated guest was caught on film in the upmarket hotel lobby climbing fully - clothed into the 12,000 - litre glass tank filled with exotic sealife			1
he then swims and paddles around - as his friends film him on a phone and can be heard laughing and giggling in the background at the @entity15 hotel in @entity16			2
but it seems not everyone was as amused by the gag and the fun was soon brought to an member of hotel staff who can be heard shouting : ' what are you f * * * ing doing ? ' as the joker finally clambers out of the tank , dripping wet , the furious male employee frogmarches him towards the exit , as his friends urge him : ' quick go '			1
bosses at the waterfront @entity54 hotel , in @entity16 - where rooms cost up to Â£ 184 a night - are now reviewing security measures following the prank at 10.30pm last saturday			2
@entity58 , director of sales and marketing , said the fish were all unharmed			0
she added : ' it was a careless act and dangerous for all involved , including the fish			0
' footage of the incident has been posted on @entity65 where it has been viewed more than 10,000 times			0
but @entity65 users were equally unimpressed after the video was posted online , with one commenting : ' did you check to see if they had a pool ? ' another web user who came across the 44 - second clip wrote : ' maybe try filling the tank with piranha fish			0
