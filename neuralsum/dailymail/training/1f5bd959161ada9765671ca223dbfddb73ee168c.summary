by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:07 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 18 october 2012 criticism : mr @entity3 said @entity5 ’s attempts to use human rights legislation to prevent @entity8 ministers from removing him to @entity9 for a third time were ' breathtaking ' an exasperated judge yesterday attacked a failed asylum seeker 's bid to use human rights law to stay in @entity15 as ' breathtaking '			1
@entity9 @entity16 has already cost the taxpayer more than £ 100,000 after being kicked out of the country twice , only to re-enter @entity15 within months			2
but in an astonishing example of the immigration @entity21 , his lawyers went to court yesterday to argue he should be allowed to stay here – this time because he said he was in a relationship with a @entity27 woman			2
as a result , they claimed , sending mr sunday home would breach his right to a private and family life under @entity33 of the @entity34			1
the application for judicial review was dismissed out of hand by @entity38 , who said the applicant 's attempt to use human rights laws to prevent him from being flown back to @entity9 for a third time was ' breathtaking '			1
' this is an incredible case , ' said the judge , at a @entity47 hearing in @entity48			1
' this is a case where the claimant has not been removed once but twice			1
this is the third time			2
what on earth is going on ? ' why should the court waste any more public money ? ' he added : ' this case is so ... utterly without merit that no further public money should be wasted in dealing with it			1
' mr sunday , 38 , first came to the notice of immigration officials in 2004 when he applied for indefinite leave to remain in @entity15			1
this was refused the following year and he was served with illegal entry papers telling him he would be sent home			2
he then launched an asylum application , but withdrew it within a year			2
in 2005 , he was put on a plane to @entity9 by the @entity8 and told he would not be allowed back in			1
however by 2006 he had returned to the @entity15 and made a second asylum application			2
the same year he was put on a plane and sent home			0
despite twice having been removed , he was able to return to the @entity15 within a year in november 2006			0
in 2007 , he was arrested when he tried to open a bank account with a forged passport			0
mr @entity3 said the case was ' incredible ' and ' breath - taking ' at the @entity47 in @entity48 again he was served with illegal entry papers and told he would be kicked out			1
but instead of being put in detention he was granted bail and went on the run			0
he lived freely in the @entity15 until this year when he was arrested by chance during a raid by immigration officers			0
he was set to be deported for the third time in may , but launched yet another appeal just weeks before his flight date			0
he claimed he had started a relationship with a woman from @entity27			0
marriage to an @entity90 national can confer rights to live in @entity15			1
but this appeal was rejected by officials because they found no evidence of any relationship			0
his lawyers then applied for a judicial review in june , which was refused , but mr sunday applied again in july and the case finally came before a judge yesterday			1
last year nearly 3,200 migrants were given the right to stay in @entity15 as a result of @entity107 rulings			0
home secretary @entity108 has made changes to immigration rules which will make it harder for migrants to use @entity33 8 as a reason to remain in @entity15			0
a @entity115 spokesman said : ' this demonstrates why we 're determined to deal with these cases more quickly			0
our tough new immigration rules will prevent individuals from abusing the legal process with frivolous claims			1
we are pursuing his removal as a matter of urgency			0

@entity128 said @entity5 's attempts to use human rights legislation to prevent @entity8 from removing him were ' breath - taking '
the judge dismissed mr sunday ’s attempt to launch a ' judicial review ' and said no more public money should be wasted on the case
