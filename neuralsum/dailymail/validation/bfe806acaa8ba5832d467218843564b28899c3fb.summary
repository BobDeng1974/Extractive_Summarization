even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to @entity6 's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers , the prospect of @entity1 being involved with the national team is an enticing one			1
nothing is certain at this stage , but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly - half will agree to give his input as @entity18 's squad prepare for the @entity19			1
if the 35 - year - old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts — and that would appear to be a big if — it would n't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy , certainly not on a regular basis			1
@entity1 could lend his expertise to @entity6 's @entity31 preperations @entity1 , who was a fly - half , kicked the winning drop goal to lead @entity6 to @entity19 glory in 2003 @entity1 has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid @entity6 's @entity19 preparations @entity6 coach @entity18 would not ignore the opportunity to use @entity1 's know - how but most @entity6 supporters would settle for @entity1 popping into the hq in @entity41 on his way to the supermarket , if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner 's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015			1
it is all about the aura			0
here is a man who was once the nation 's sporting darling , while in rugby circles he is treated with a mixture of respect and awe			2
in the south of @entity62 , where he worked wonders for @entity65 in the closing years of his career , he is adored			2
when false rumours surfaced at the start of the year that he was destined for a knighthood , they were assumed to be correct			0
such an honour would have surprised no one			0
the current generation of @entity6 players grew up admiring his epic deeds			2
the fly - halves in particular — @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 — could learn so much from the maestro			2
@entity18 has an established coaching group and there are no plans to expand it , for now			0
at present , @entity87 works with the kickers in camp , while another @entity91 coach , @entity90 , has also spent time with them , though less so recently			2
@entity93 has private sessions with @entity1 's kicking mentor , the renowned @entity95 , who has not had a role in the national set - up since the last @entity19			1
but any chance to tap into the know - how of one of the country 's all - time greats , with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach , would not be casually ignored by @entity105			1
@entity1 has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor , and has done so part - time with @entity65 this season			1
@entity1 ( centre ) is revered in @entity65 , where he spent the final years of his career as a player @entity105 already has one 2003 @entity19 winner in his coaching ranks in @entity87 ( centre ) @entity1 's input could help @entity6 's current fly - halfs such as @entity79 @entity81 ( left ) and @entity80 are @entity6 's other alternatives at fly - half for all his personal accomplishments , he is wise enough to accept that playing pedigree does not necessarily translate into coaching credentials			1
talking last autumn , after being invited into @entity6 's camp , he said : ' if there is anything i can add , then we can have a little chat , but more importantly i need to learn my trade			1
i was a player , but just because i knew how to play does n't mean i 've earned the right to tell other people how to do it			0
' i 'm coaching one week every month in @entity65 , learning my way around it			1
i 'm coaching individual skills , mentoring some of the young guys on how to cope with the emotional and mental side of things			0
i 'm really enjoying it , but the biggest mistake you can make is thinking just because you played the game , you already know it			0
' as a recent retiree who keeps himself supremely fit , @entity1 could comfortably take on an active role , demonstrating the points he makes			2
in fact , it would not be a leap of the mind to imagine him matching @entity6 's current kickers shot for shot in extended practice sessions			1
while there is scope to improve the kicking game , both at goal and tactical , @entity1 is a big admirer of the men currently country 's vying for his old shirt			1
@entity1 ( left ) acknowledges that success as a player offers no guarantees to becoming a skilled coach @entity18 ( left ) and his @entity6 side narrowly missed out on @entity168 glory on saturday @entity1 speaks highly of the abilities of @entity6 's current fly - halfs , especially @entity93 and @entity80 ' @entity79 is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is an absolute natural in the way he reads the game , ' he said			1
' he works hard , wants to improve and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it			0
that makes him a great person to have in that position			0
' @entity80 is immensely mentally tough and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years			0
as a young guy , he has said , ' here is pressure , i will deal with it			0
not only that , i will kick your goals for you and stand up in defence and bring this team together '			0
' that talented pair would speak highly of their acclaimed predecessor too			0
it could be a perfect fit			0
@entity6 have the biggest representation on a 12 - strong list for the @entity168 player of the tournament			1
@entity204 , @entity79 , @entity205 and @entity206 feature alongside @entity208 's @entity207 , @entity209 and @entity210 , @entity212 @entity211 and @entity213 , @entity215 @entity214 and @entity216 , and @entity218 captain @entity217 .			2

@entity1 could help @entity6 's @entity31 preparations
@entity1 has been learning to coach part - time with @entity65 this season
@entity1 was a @entity19 winner with @entity6 in 2003
