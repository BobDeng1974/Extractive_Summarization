the extent of the married grandmother ’s thieving came to light when her employers , an estate agency , carried out an audit earlier this year			1
they discovered @entity26 had transferred a total of £ 390,550 into her personal bank accounts over seven years , concealing the payments as tenant deposit returns			1
she made 390 transactions into four accounts , and then covered up the payments by editing the company ’s accounts system to make them look legitimate			1
