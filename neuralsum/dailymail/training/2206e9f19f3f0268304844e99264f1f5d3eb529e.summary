banish the bucket , sponge and hose			0
@entity4 giant @entity3 has developed the world ’s first ‘ self - cleaning car ’ which it predicts will make car - washing ‘ obsolete			1
’ its @entity8 engineers are testing innovative ‘ nano - paint technology ’ which repels dirt before it gets a chance to take hold on the paintwork			2
here you can see the split on the car , with the nanopaint being used on the right but not on the left , showing how it stopped dirt sticking for drivers who would rather run a mile than wipe down their dirty vehicles with a sponge or wince at the high cost of a car - wash , it means salvation may soon be at hand			2
it is set to be an option on future models but is being tested in @entity8 on the new @entity35 - built @entity36 which went on sale in october priced from £ 12,100 to £ 17,100			2
no price has yet been set but it is likely to be around £ 450 ( $ 750 ) – or similar to a metallic paint option			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity36 is first car to trial paint which could make car washes obsolete			1
‘ washing a car can be a chore - and a costly one at that			0
in response , @entity3 has begun tests on innovative paint technology that repels mud , rain and everyday dirt , meaning drivers may never have to clean their car again			1
’ scientists have developed ‘ super-hydrophobic ’ and ‘ oleophobic ’ paint , which repels water and oils			1
it has been applied to the all - new @entity36 supermini to create what it calls ‘ the world 's first self - cleaning car ’			2
@entity3 says it is the first to apply the trade - marked technology called @entity67 on automotive bodywork a @entity3 spokesman said : ' by creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment , it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car 's surface ' @entity3 says it is the first carmaker to apply the trade - marked technology called @entity80 on automotive bodywork and will be testing it ‘ in the real world ’ over the coming months at its @entity82 at @entity83 in @entity84			1
explaining how the dirt - repellent coating works , a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ by creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment , it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car 's surface			1
’ the note already features a ‘ wash and blow dry ' function on its rear view camera			0
this uses water and compressed air to automatically keep the lens free of dirt and ensure the @entity102 ' safety sensors work in all conditions			0
a spokesman said : ‘ so far , the coating has responded well to common use cases including rain , spray , frost , sleet and standing water			0
’ chief marketing manager @entity112 said ; ‘ the @entity36 has been carefully engineered to take the stress out of customer driving and @entity3 's engineers are constantly thinking of new ways to make families ' lives easier			1
‘ we are committed to addressing everyday problems our customers face and will always consider testing exciting , cutting edge technology like this incredible coating application			0
’ @entity3 employs 8,500 people in @entity8 , including 7,300 at the @entity35 factory , 950 at the @entity126 and 50 at @entity3 ’s @entity128 design centre at @entity129 in @entity130			0
so far the coating has responded well to common use cases including rain , spray and standing water			0

@entity3 has *unveiled* its nanopaint technology that stops a car getting dirty
first car to trial the paint , which costs £ 450 ( $ 750 ) , will be the @entity36
the ' super-hydrophobic ' and ' oleophobic ' paint repels water and oils
@entity3 says the technology ' could make car washes obsolete '
