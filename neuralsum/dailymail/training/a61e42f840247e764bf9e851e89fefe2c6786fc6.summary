finishing a project early and handing it in before it ’s due might seem like a good idea , but a study claims there ’s no benefit to doing so			1
in fact , researchers say that people do n’t care if you finish scheduled work before a deadline - but they do care if it ’s late			1
in the research they found that while breaking a promise was costly , exceeding it was not worth the additional effort			1
researchers at the @entity18 and @entity19 say breaking promises is more important than working hard and exceeding them ( stock image shown )			1
in research they found people were not impressed by overachievers			1
and they were very annoyed when a promise was not kept to the study was carried out by dr @entity29 from the @entity30 and dr @entity31 from the @entity19			1
having plants in your office can make staff happier and more productive , researchers have claimed			0
they said a bit of greenery can boost productivity by 15 % researchers say their study is the first to examine the effects of ' green ' vs ' lean ' or minimalist offices with little furniture			0
they studied the effects of greenery on staff 's perceptions of air quality , concentration , and workplace satisfaction , and monitored productivity levels over subsequent months in two large commercial offices in the @entity54 and @entity55			0
lead researcher @entity56 , from @entity58 's @entity57 , said : ' our research suggests that investing in landscaping the office with plants will pay off through an increase in office workers quality of life and productivity			2
' ' simply enriching a previously @entity69 space with plants served to increase productivity by 15 % - a figure that aligns closely with findings in previously conducted laboratory studies			0
they examined people ’s responses to a promise being broken , kept and exceeded			2
and they say this is due to people overvaluing kept promises , which suggests ‘ a general tendency in social systems to discourage selfishness and reward cooperation , ’ they write			2
in one of several experiments carried out by the researchers they paired up participants and tasked one with solving 40 puzzles			0
for each puzzle solved , they would receive a monetary reward			0
however the other in the pair , the ‘ promise - maker ’ , was tasked to offer their help in solving ten of them			0
when the promise - maker exceeded their task by solving 15 puzzles , the promise - receivers did not value that much more than when they stuck to the original ten			0
however , when help was only offered on five puzzles , the promise - receiver viewed their partner much more negatively			0
a similar study , which gave participants better or worse seats to a concert , elicited similar responses			0
‘ breaking one ’s promise is costly , but exceeding it does not appear worth the effort , ’ the researchers conclude			1
the study suggests that finishing a project early does not earn you much praise			1
but failing to stick to a deadline can prove to be much more costly			1
in one experiment people were not particularly impressed when concert tickets were upgraded , but were annoyed if they were downgraded ( stock image shown )			2
