this river in northern @entity1 has become an isolated sanctuary teeming with wildlife thanks to centuries of urban legend , tragedies and bandits who terrified locals with horrendous acts of violence - but it may be undone in just a matter of years			1
nearby villagers had long believed that the @entity13 , and the infertile soil surrounding it , was cursed or too dangerous to traverse , making it largely a no - go zone			1
their fears allowed the area to become a haven for crocodiles , jackals , river dolphins and endangered birds , which lay small speckled eggs in the sand			1
@entity1 's @entity13 is teeming with wildlife , including crocodiles , but it is facing growing environmental threats from humans @entity31 villagers cross the @entity13 on a packed ferry near @entity34 village in the northern @entity31 state of @entity36 a man drinks straight from the @entity13 as villagers wade through the shallow waters after crossing on a ferry chicks and speckled eggs of the endangered @entity31 skimmer rest in a pit nest in a sandbar on the banks of the river what makes the @entity13 so remarkable is that it thrived and remained essentially wild while the rest of the region developed into a deeply - polluted industrial belt			1
the stench of industrial fumes fills the air in towns and tons of raw sewage is dumped every day into many rivers			0
but the @entity13 itself is now facing threats from humans like never before , raising fears about the fate of its creatures , including several varieties of birds and rare crocodile - like gharials , which can be found nowhere else on the planet			2
garbage is piling up , plastic bags blow through the ravines , increased farming has led to fertiliser and pesticide runoff , and factories , construction projects and stone quarries are dumping pollutants straight into the river or its tributaries			0
an @entity31 villager follows a camel , carrying a load of firewood , as they cross the @entity13 near @entity34 village the @entity13 region is home to rare crocodile - like gharials , which can be found nowhere else on the planet hundreds of storks , geese , babblers , larks and other birds nest along the river , which is facing an uncertain future dr @entity99 , a scientist with the @entity1 - based @entity100 , told the @entity101 : ‘ in the old days , there were n't many people here to interfere with the river			1
‘ but with the bandits gone , the pressure on the river is now just too much			0
’ beliefs that the river was unholy have faded and the last of the famed outlaws was killed by police in 2005 after their political patrons were driven out of office			0
@entity31 villagers alight from a ferry after crossing the @entity13 near @entity34 village in the northern @entity31 state of @entity36 development along the river is booming after the last of the bandits , who had enormous power in the region , were killed or driven away for hundreds of years , bandits , who wielded enormous power , ruled the labyrinth of scrub - filled ravines and tiny villages along the river deep pits are visible near the bank of the @entity13 after they were dug out by illegal sand miners near @entity132 the bandits held enormous power in the poverty - stricken and lawless region			2
now that they are gone , villagers regularly traverse the river with camels or boats ferrying people from one side to the other			2
yet the river is facing many environmental threats even though a 250 - mile stretch was declared an official sanctuary nearly 40 years ago			0
as people take advantage of cheap land and untapped resources , today ’s biggest concerns include corruption , which is leading to deforestation and illegal sand mining for concrete production , and @entity1 ’s undertrained and underfunded wildlife agencies			1
for years villagers were afraid to venture near the river because of the presence of bandits and the belief that it was unholy labourers who are paid $ 15 a day load sand onto tractor trolleys at an illegal sand mine on the banks of the @entity13 villagers prepare for the cremation of an elderly woman on the banks of the @entity13 near @entity34 village in @entity36 flames rise from the cremation pyre of an elderly woman along the banks of the river , which is under threat from pollution and corruption one of the illegal sand mines can be found near the village of @entity34 , where men can earn an attractive $ 15 a day ( just under £ 10 ) to shovel sand for bosses who they claim have paid off local officials			1
one of the labourers , @entity185 , told the @entity101 : ' what is a sanctuary ? what is a mammal ? what is a bird ? i do n't have time to worry about these things			0
' @entity195 , an aristocrat with a crumbling family fort overlooking the river from @entity198 , has watched the transformation as dirt paths became paved roads , making villages easily accessible from the outside world			0
he worries about the future of the region as corruption takes hold and people ignore the environment , adding : ‘ we were so isolated for so long			0
