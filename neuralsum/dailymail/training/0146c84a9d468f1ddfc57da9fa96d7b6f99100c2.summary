by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 13:48 est , 20 june 2013 women who are pregnant are receiving less protection at work than those who are injured			1
under the @entity5 , companies are required to provide injured employees with ' reasonable accommodation '			1
for example , if someone who regularly lifts heavy objects at work injures their back , the employer is required to modify their job duties			1
discrimination : pregnant woman - especially working class ones in physically demanding jobs - receive no guaranteed protection from losing their jobs , unlike injured empoyees but even though pregnant women are often advised by doctors not carry out physically demanding activities , there is currently no law that protects them from losing their jobs if they can not perform certain tasks			1
indeed @entity29 , co-founder of @entity31 nonprofit @entity30 , explains that the unbalanced law has a particularly significant impact on low - wage women in physically demanding jobs			2
' women do n't have a clear legal right , ' she told @entity37			2
' and yet disabled workers			0
a man could come back from a ski accident and it 's like , " let me get you an ergonomically designed chair			0
" ' the reasonable accommodations that would benefit pregnant women would be relatively minimal and cheap , such as more bathroom breaks , a stool to sit on or permission to carry a water bottle			1
but under the law , only expectant women suffering from severe pregnancy - related conditions like preeclampsia - which can develop into life - threatening seizures - are entitled to reasonable accommodation			1
for otherwise healthy pregnant women , having a baby bump can be seen as a hindrance to many employers , whose attitude is : ' if you ca n't do this job , you go			2
' that was the case for one woman named @entity66 , who was forced to quit her grocery store job after her boss told her there were ' no jobs ' that did n't require lifting heavy objects or pushing heavy bakery carts			2
these were tasks her doctor had specifically asked her not to do , since a series of miscarriages had left her with a blood clotting disorder			0
even though @entity66 offered to do work at the cash register or in the office instead , she says her boss refused			0
' pregnant women do n't have a clear legal right , yet disabled workers do ' the most unfair aspect of this , she says , is that injured employees are treated completely differently			1
' one woman , she hurt her shoulder , ' she recounted			0
' they gave her a job re-shelving lighter items			0
pregnant women are supposed to be protected under the @entity93 , which states : ' if an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job because of her pregnancy , the employer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled employee			2
' but @entity100 , policy counsel at the @entity101 , says this is rarely enforced			0
' there 's a gap in protection under the law , ' she said			0
' courts have not interpreted the federal @entity93 to require employers to provide reasonable accommodations			1
' in @entity31 , women can opt to file a charge with the @entity112 , but this often takes months to accomplish , time which many pregnant women simply do not have			0
later this month , though , this all may change if @entity117 passes the proposed @entity118			0
according to @entity37 , the law would require employers to provide reasonable accommodation for any pregnancy - related condition , ' unless doing so would cause an undue hardship on the employer			1

under the @entity5 , companies are required to modify the job duties of injured employees
currently , only women suffering from severe pregnancy - related conditions are entitled to such ' reasonable accommodations '
