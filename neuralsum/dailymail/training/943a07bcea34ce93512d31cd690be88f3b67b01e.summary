by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 19 july 2013 in her chic black quilted leather skirt and neon collared t - shirt , princess @entity1 cut a stylish figure as she enjoyed a night out with friends at @entity9 's @entity8 nightclub			1
but while the ensemble looked good , was it so good that the princess chose to wear the exact same outfit for a second time 24 hours later ? the all - black outfit made its first appearance on wednesday night when princess @entity1 sported it during a night out with a group of friends			2
hope you 've got some @entity19 ! the ensemble appears on wednesday night ( left ) and yesterday ( right )			0
only the shoes had been changed - from high black heels to zebra ballet flats social life : like her mother @entity25 , princess @entity1 appears to have a penchant for partying teamed with a chic sparkling pink @entity29 clutch and a classic pair of black patent court shoes , the skirt and t - shirt combined to create the perfect party look			1
and the princess clearly was n't the only one to think so			0
during her time at the racy night spot , she was the recipient of numerous admiring male glances and was photographed enveloped in the arms of an enthusiastic male friend at the end of the night , who planted a kiss on the smiling princess 's head			0
boyfriend @entity45 , meanwhile , was nowhere to be seen thanks to the pressures of his work at @entity50 's space travel company , @entity49			0
the next evening , the outfit was back for an evening with princess @entity52 and the @entity25 , although the princess had found time to exchange her court shoes for pretty zebra print pumps			1
smiling broadly as she left members - only club @entity59 's , princess @entity1 looked remarkably fresh for a girl on a two - day party mission - even if her outfit was not			1
love : the sisters and their mother were joined by @entity52 's 27 - year - old boyfriend , @entity65 mystery man : glamorous @entity1 was seen cuddling up to a male friend outside @entity8 on wednesday not around : princess @entity1 's boyfriend @entity68 was nowhere to be seen during the @entity8 du @entity8 visit although it is not known whether @entity1 made it home between her nights out - whether or not she did is likely to remain a mystery - sister @entity52 did n't appear to be concerned as she sauntered out of the club on the arm of boyfriend , @entity65			1
their mother , the former @entity25 , did n't seem to mind either and looked elegant in a monochrome ensemble			0
@entity59 's is a favourite @entity82 hangout and is owned by @entity84 - oldest son of @entity85 and half - brother to @entity88 mp @entity87			2
as well as the @entity91 sisters , @entity89 is regularly spotted drinking at the private establishment , and the @entity94 and prince @entity95 were often seen leaving the club before a certain @entity82 baby put paid to their socialising .			0

@entity1 was joined at @entity59 's by her mother and sister on day two
