but the way in which our appearance changes as we grow older is clear to see in a thought - provoking video produced by a @entity11 filmmaker			1
@entity12 found 100 people , ranging in age from nought to 100 , and persuaded them to reveal on camera how old they were			1
he then put all the clips together to make a poignant video showing the volunteers counting to 100 - revealing how the ageing process alters how we look as we continue on life 's journey			1
he admitted that his collection was not completely representative of the population of @entity38 , where the project was filmed , as representatives of some minorities were more reluctant to appear on camera than others			1
mr @entity12 said : ' in october 2011 i started documenting people in the city of @entity38 , approaching them in the street and asking them to say their age in front of the camera			1
' my aim was to " collect " a group of 100 people , from age 0 to 100			2
a one - year - old child a two - year - old boy a girl aged three a 13 - year - old boy a girl aged 14 this boy says ' 15 ' ' 18 ' ' 21 ' ' 30 ' ' 40 ' ' 45 ' ' 50 ' ' at first my collection grew fast but slowed down when it got down to the very young and very old			0
the young because of sensivity around filming or photographing children and the very old because they do n't get out of the house much			0
' i found my very old " models " in care homes and it was a privilege to document these - often vulnerable - people for this project			0
' i had particular problems finding a 99 year - old			0
( apparently 100 year - olds enjoy notoriety , but a 99 year - old is a rare species ... ) ' and when i finally did find one , she refused to state her age			2
' she simply denied being 99 years old ! but finally , some four months after i recorded my first " age " , i was able to capture the " missing link " and conclude this project			0
' ' 54 ' ' 55 ' ' 56 ' ' 60 ' ' 65 ' ' 70 ' ' 75 ' ' 76 ' ' 77 ' ' 83 ' ' 84 ' ' 85 ' ' 90 ' ' 91 ' ' 92 ' ' 98 ' ' 99 ' ' 100 ' now watch the video ...			2

@entity11 filmmaker @entity12 asked 100 volunteers from @entity38 to reveal their age on camera
the *resulting* video shows how our appearance changes as we grow older
