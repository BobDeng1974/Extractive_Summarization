it took 12 minutes before a section of @entity3 ’s fans started their weekly invitation to @entity6 to seek alternative employment			1
how much leeway , if any , can be bought with a point at the @entity10 remains to be seen			1
certainly , the prognosis looks better , a draw coming against a backdrop of 19 points taken from the previous 26 games			0
more than that , there was the evidence here of a fighting spirit , manifested in the goals of @entity23 ’s @entity22 , who twice pulled @entity3 level in a game they often looked like losing but , ultimately , might have won			1
booked : @entity38 manager : @entity28 6 @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity52 7.5 ; @entity53 5.5 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 5.5 , @entity56 5 ; @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 68 , 6 ) , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 5 , @entity62 5 ( @entity63 58 , 6.5 ) ; @entity22 8 ( @entity64 85 ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			1
booked : @entity54 , @entity61 , @entity53 manager : @entity6 6 referee : @entity72 6 att : 20,622 @entity73 : @entity22 so that is progress and , most likely , a stay of execution for a manager who could desperately use some popularity points			1
not that you would know it , with his frostiness towards elements of the media continuing after the game			0
‘ the players will be more confident coming out of the game than they were coming in , ’ @entity6 said , with extra praise reserved for recalled striker @entity22 , who had his first start of the season and took his tally to four goals			1
‘ @entity22 had a tough season [ in 2013 - 14 ] with a lot of injuries and @entity97 took his place			1
he looks like the rest has done him good			0
the first finish was brilliant and the second was instinct			0
he is in a good place at the moment			0
’ not everyone at the club , particularly @entity6 , can say that			2
@entity31 manager @entity28 has certainly been in a better mood than he was after this match			1
his side gave away the lead on two occasions , after @entity113 and @entity114 had scored			1
he was also unhappy with the refereeing of @entity72			0
he said : ‘ it is two points dropped for us			0
the goals we conceded were poor			0
a lack of concentration really has cost us dearly			0
‘ after the second goal , possession became too easy for @entity3			2
in those situations you have to learn to keep your concentration , do n’t get sloppy			0
we should have won by a couple of goals			0
’ the refereeing , in particular , agitated him , coming days after he complained that sides are allowed to get away with too much by disrupting his passing side with fouls			0
‘ i do n’t know what else i can say , ’ @entity28 said			0
‘ it has gone unheard			0
they had 10 , 13 , 14 fouls before anything [ a yellow card ] happened			0
’ for @entity6 , there was the vindication of a brave selection succeeding			2
he dropped two summer signings in @entity143 and @entity59 , who cost a combined £ 18 million and have , as yet , failed to deliver			0
@entity144 came @entity60 and @entity22 and they played well for the team			2
for a time , theirs was the only contribution worth cheering			0
indeed , the game was less than 10 minutes old when owner @entity148 was the subject of frustrated fans ’ attention with a chant of ‘ you fat @entity154 b * * * * * * , get out of our club ’			1
supporters then dished out similar treatment to @entity6 a couple of minutes later			1
by then , @entity57 had already played a pass straight into touch			0
@entity113 puts away the opener from inside the penalty area to give @entity31 the lead over @entity3 @entity44 slots his shot passed @entity52 in the @entity3 goal to take the lead for the high - flying @entity168 @entity169 striker @entity113 celebrates his goal with team - mate @entity39 ( right ) @entity22 points to @entity6 after scoring the equaliser for @entity3 after getting a chance to start up front by the manager under fire @entity3 manager @entity6 smiles and gives @entity22 the thumbs up after the goal that made the score 1 - 1 mins @entity179 @entity31 total 108.9 67.7 @entity37 90 11.9 7.4 @entity180 86 11.3 7.0 @entity38 90 11.0 6.8 @entity3 total 113.5 70.5 @entity61 90 11.3 7.0 @entity57 90 11.2 7.0 @entity56 90 10.9 6.8 data courtesy of the @entity182 , the @entity183 of the @entity184 ‘ @entity6 for @entity186 , ’ sang the @entity31 fans			1
it can be a cruel game sometimes			0
for @entity6 , that extended to going one down just moments after @entity3 ’s first promising attack			1
@entity60 had fired wide in the 17th minute following some impressive pressing , but in the very next phase @entity31 were ahead after a white blur of one - touch passing			1
@entity194 played through the middle , @entity113 laid off for @entity180 and the @entity198 forward ’s pass was perfect			2
@entity113 went through and scored his first of the season , a staggering statistic in light of his 25 goals last time round			1
@entity3 would have been two down in the 38th minute had it not been for goalkeeper @entity52 ’s agility			1
@entity114 had out - paced @entity53 on the left and play switched to @entity39 on the right			1
there was a solid argument to be made for either of @entity31 ’s wingers to get an @entity186 call earlier in the week and @entity39 strengthened it by darting past @entity56			2
@entity39 ’s low cross was met on the volley by @entity44 , but @entity52 reacted swiftly to tip the shot wide			0
against such @entity31 momentum , @entity3 levelled two minutes before half - time			1
poetically , it was the two men @entity6 drafted in who did the damage			2
@entity60 found space on the right and hit a low cross to the near post			0
@entity22 got away from @entity35 and glanced a finish across keeper @entity32			2
it was @entity3 ’s first away goal in 763 minutes			2
@entity114 beats @entity52 to reclaim the lead for @entity31 at the @entity10 @entity22 scores is second equaliser of the match to bring @entity3 level at 2 - 2 did it inspire a significant improvement ? @entity58 kicked straight into touch from the kick - off and within five minutes @entity31 were ahead again			1
@entity38 , who has been called up by @entity186 , took possession on the left and squared to @entity180			0
the forward held off a weak challenge from @entity61 and slotted a pass to @entity114 , whose chipped goal was delightful			2
@entity52 then denied @entity113 , his save perhaps even better than that in the first half , and once more it was followed by a @entity22 equaliser			1
@entity63 , on as a substitute , made it with a 75th - minute cross from the right and @entity22 found space between @entity33 and @entity35 to poke the ball over the line			1
it was a poor goal to concede , but it was a blessing for @entity6			2
@entity22 got on the end of @entity63 's cross and squeezes his shot under keeper @entity32 @entity32 is helpless as @entity22 's 75th - minute finish finds the net from close range @entity3 manager @entity6 shows what @entity22 's second goal means as his team picks up a huge away point @entity22 celebrates his second after he was recalled by @entity6 , who dropped summer signings @entity143 and @entity59 @entity3 fans before the match calling for the head of their manager with ' @entity274 ' posters @entity22 gets an enthusiastic high 10 from his boss @entity6 after he his substituted shortly before full - time @entity3 owner @entity148 ( right ) after the final whistle is blown in his side 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity31			1

@entity3 salvaged a huge away point against @entity31 at the @entity10
@entity113 opened the scoring for @entity31 after 17 minutes
@entity22 found the equaliser for @entity3 just before half - time
@entity114 scored in the 50th minute to reclaim the lead for the @entity168
@entity22 found his second in the 75th minute to bring @entity3 back level
@entity3 fans called for owner @entity148 to sack @entity6 throughout the match
