by @entity0 intruder : @entity2 was found sleeping in a child 's bedroom			1
this photograph was taken minutes later a couple were left traumatised after they found an intruder high on drugs in their sleeping four - year - old son ’s bedroom			1
but another shock was to follow when police said they would not prosecute the man , even though he had confessed			2
@entity16 found the man asleep on the floor when she went to wake her son @entity19			1
her screams disturbed him and he fled , but not before her partner @entity21 took a picture of the 6ft bearded stranger			1
he was arrested and admitted he had been in the boy ’s room			0
but to the astonishment of mr @entity21 and @entity28 , police dropped all the charges and let him go			1
officers told the couple that @entity2 had been cautioned for drug offences but otherwise had not broken the law – as he had gained access to the house through the back door , which had been left unlocked			1
the only action that could be taken was for trespass – which is a civil matter , not a criminal offence			1
that would mean the couple taking out their own court case against the unemployed 24 - year - old			1
‘ i ca n’t believe the police have dropped the charges and are refusing to prosecute him , ’ said mr @entity21 , 31 , who even tracked @entity2 down to confront him over what he had done			1
‘ he has admitted he was there			0
but still the police wo n’t do anything about it			2
’ miss @entity16 told of her horror when she discovered @entity2 in @entity19 ’s room when she went to wake her son up one morning last month at their home in @entity58 , @entity59			1
the stranger was lying on the floor			2
she kicked him awake and yelled for mr @entity21 to call the police			1
‘ i could n’t believe it – there was this man in @entity19 ’s room , ’ she said			0
‘ i kicked him and shouted at him			0
he came around and started mumbling			0
soon he was up on his feet and telling me everything was ok			0
@entity21 was on the phone to the police and we chased him out of the house			1
terrified : @entity16 ( left ) found @entity2 asleep on the floor when she went to wake her sons ( pictured )			1
her partner @entity21 ( centre ) was able to take a photograph of the 6ft bearded stranger ‘ police found him down the road shortly afterwards and arrested him			1
‘ @entity19 assures us that the man did n’t touch him or do anything horrible to him but i still worry what might have happened			0
‘ surely it must be against the law for a stranger to go into a little boy ’s bedroom without his parents ’ consent			2
’ the couple , who have another son @entity92 , four months , have since decided to move , she added			2
‘ i could n’t stay in that house after that			2
i just did n’t feel safe			0
we ’ve had to move to another property which is more expensive but what else could we do ? ’ @entity2 , of @entity98 , @entity59 , is believed to have got in through the back door , which had been unlocked to let the family dog out earlier that morning			1
police told the couple he could not be pursued for burglary or breaking and entering as he had entered via an unsecured door			1
frustrated by the lack of police action , mr @entity21 traced @entity2 , who asked for forgiveness			1
‘ he admitted he was the intruder and said he was sorry , ’ said mr @entity21 , who works at @entity108 in @entity109			1
‘ a child ’s bedroom should be somewhere where they feel happy to play and are safe			0
this could easily have made @entity19 afraid of being on his own			0
luckily he has coped really well			0
’ @entity2 admitted to the @entity115 yesterday that he was the intruder – but he insisted @entity19 was never in danger			2
he said he had lived at the property himself about two years ago and had thought he was returning home			2
‘ i had taken some drugs and i did n’t know where i was			0
it was n’t medication , it was recreational , i wanted to get high , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve got children myself so there was never any reason for that boy ’s parents to worry			0
i ’ve spoken to them and told them i ’m sorry so i do n’t know why they keeping going on about this			0
‘ i was arrested and charged with causing criminal damage and possession of drugs but the police dropped all the charges			2
@entity135 said : ‘ a man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drugs offences			0
he was released with no further action in respect of criminal damage and was given a formal caution for drugs offences			0
‘ no other criminal offences were identified by our officers			0
