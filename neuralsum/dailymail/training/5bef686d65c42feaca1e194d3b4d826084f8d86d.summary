by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:21 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 11:49 est , 12 january 2014 he was once the toast of high society and no champagne - fuelled party was complete without him			0
@entity8 was a fixture in the gossip columns , had homes in @entity12 and @entity13 , and boasted that he could date any woman in the world			1
but today the disgraced tycoon , dubbed ‘ @entity18 ’ by friends , cuts a pitiful figure – handcuffed to a prison guard in hospital after undergoing a second kidney transplant			1
the self - styled ‘ lord ’ – jailed for his role in a multi-million pound fraud – is trying to stay positive despite his condition but admits : ‘ i know i ’m fighting a death sentence			1
’ handcuffed : @entity8 is chained up in his treatment room at @entity31 , @entity12 in an exclusive interview with @entity33 from his bed at @entity31 in @entity12 , @entity8 , 47 , says : ‘ i was diagnosed with a defective kidney when i was about 15 and had my first transplant about 15 years ago			1
‘ i never told anyone about it as it did n’t really fit in with my image			0
but over the past few years it became apparent that that kidney was not working any more			1
i was in prison and feeling ill. ‘ i ’d been on the @entity44 donor list for another transplant for ages and then my name up just before @entity48 – i think somebody had a tragic accident and lost their life			1
before that i was travelling to @entity31 ’s , chained up with three prison officers , three times a week for dialysis			1
it was an ordeal for them and me			0
’ thin and grey - faced , @entity8 has been shaken by his stint in hospital			1
he also needed a vital second operation after his transplant , to treat an aneurysm – a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall			2
‘ my life hung in the balance			0
it was touch - and - go , ’ @entity8 admits			1
certainly his situation today is a far cry from the image he cultivated when he burst on to the @entity12 party scene in the 1980s			1
his black - tie @entity77 , aimed at wealthy public school teenagers , quickly became synonymous with drunkenness and debauchery			0
socialising : ' @entity18 ' with socialite @entity81 at a party in 1994 life of luxury : the fraudster owned many properties in @entity12 and lived in the @entity88 hotel in @entity89 the business made him a fortune but it crashed when he was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to nine months in jail			1
despite the setback , @entity8 never lost his love of taking risks – even though it repeatedly landed him in trouble			2
in 1998 , he and two other men were charged with running up an £ 18,000 bill at the luxury @entity101 in @entity102 during a five - day @entity104 party while posing as aristocrats			2
they denied the claims and charges were later dropped			0
a year later , he bought the lease of the @entity111 high commission building in @entity112 for just £ 50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war			2
the property – now his home – is said to be worth £ 30 million and was used to film scenes for the @entity119 - winning movie @entity120			2
in may 2011 , @entity8 was given eight years for his part in a £ 4 million fraud			1
the judge described him as the ‘ ringmaster ’ who was careful not to leave ‘ footprints in the snow			0
’ after his health deteriorated , @entity8 ’s lawyer @entity128 lodged an application to have him released on the grounds of ill - health			2
she hopes to secure a hearing as early as next month			0
police escort : he was travelling with prison guards to @entity31 ; s @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity12 , three times a week for dialysis ‘ i feel like an old man shuffling around , chained to a prison officer even when i want to go to the bathroom , ’ says @entity8			1
‘ after the operation i was given a cocktail of drugs which gave me hallucinations			0
’ ironically , he says , he got a better night ’s sleep while held in @entity149			0
‘ i was in a cell on my own there and got a decent night ’s rest			0
in this renal unit there is a lot going on day and night			0
’ the only ‘ highlight ’ of his hospital stay has been the fact that his elderly mother @entity157 was allowed to visit on @entity48 – something that would not have happened had he been in jail			2
@entity8 concedes he sometimes finds it difficult to accept how much his life has changed : ‘ i ca n’t even wear my own silk pyjamas – i have to wear the hospital ones			1
the truth is i feel shaky			0
i know i ’m at death ’s door			0
