as ever , @entity4 will contribute more than their share of manpower to the country ’s cause as @entity3 prepare to face @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 in the @entity6 series , and @entity0 claimed that he and his fellow @entity36 will start the international window in good heart			2
@entity0 carries for @entity4 as they continued their excellent start to the season on both fronts @entity21 plucks a line - out from the air as @entity4 's @entity3 stars impressed again asked about the @entity11 challenge , he said : ‘ it ’s not dead , is it ? it ’s not dead			1
‘ we ’re sitting at the top of the @entity49 , which is nice , and our @entity11 campaign is still alive			1
we ’ve got two weeks of @entity51 now and we ’ve got some boys champing at the bit ; some young players ready for a game			0
we ’re in a good place			0
‘ i feel pretty good but @entity21 ’s nose looks pretty messed up ! other than that all the ( @entity3 ) boys are in good nick and we ’re excited — it ’s a big series coming up and a huge game to start			2
’ @entity19 has earned an @entity3 recall with his prodigious form and he was a forceful presence again in this demolition of the @entity66 , who were previously unbeaten this season			1
the blindside was particularly effective at the breakdown and @entity0 offered an endorsement of his credentials for national service			0
@entity0 and @entity19 combine to bring down @entity74 as @entity4 halted the @entity66 @entity16 , whose injury is a worry for @entity3 , offloads to @entity19 as @entity4 dominated ‘ he ’s a grafter , ’ said his captain			1
‘ he ’s on the ball , on the floor , working hard , making tackles , covering metres			0
you want someone like that in your team			0
’ @entity0 admitted he was ‘ worried ’ before the hosts clinched the bonus point courtesy of @entity90 ’s fourth try			0
‘ @entity12 saved the day , ’ he said , while director of rugby , @entity91 , added : ‘ he showed what a talented all - round player he is because he came into the centre tonight and did so well			1
it was a tremendous performance			0
’ four - try @entity12 , who was simply superb for @entity4 , ' saved the day ' according to his captain @entity18 last night called up nine players to @entity3 ’s training squad with uncapped @entity103 centre @entity101 in for the first time and clubmate @entity105 recalled			1
@entity101 is one of three @entity107 players called up by @entity18 to cover for injuries another uncapped @entity103 star , @entity109 , completes the trio named as injury cover for @entity112 ( concussion ) , @entity16 ( hand ) and @entity115 ( virus )			2
@entity117 lost 15 - 3 in @entity118 as the @entity119 showed their opportunistic streak in @entity121			2

@entity131 dives over to score despite the tackle of @entity139 , following an interception @entity141 struck five penalties to maintain @entity144 ’s sensational start in @entity145 as they beat @entity147 15 - 13 at @entity148			0
@entity141 was the star for @entity144 , scoring all their points in a 15 - 13 win over @entity147 in @entity152 the @entity154 ’s goal - kicking meant a late penalty try for the @entity152 side could not prevent a famous victory for @entity159 ’s men			1
they top the table , after starting with a 37 - 10 home win over @entity163 .			1

@entity19 , @entity21 and @entity165 impress against @entity66
