by @entity1 reporter acquitted : @entity2 , 22 , has been found not guilty of assaulting a drunk classmate in 2012 a @entity6 @entity5 football player has been found not guilty of sexual assaulting a drunk classmate at an off - campus party			1
@entity2 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , had been accused of having sex with the woman at a party in 2012 even though she claimed she was too drunk to consent to having sex with him			1
following a three - day trial on thursday , military judge col. @entity16 acquitted @entity18 , 22 , of aggravated sexual assault , saying prosecutors had not proved their case beyond reasonable doubt			1
one of @entity18 's attorneys , @entity24 , said his client 's reaction to the decision was ' one of great relief ' and called him a ' good young man '			2
but an attorney for the woman said in a telephone interview after the judge 's verdict that ' deeply disappointed does n't adequately describe ' his client 's reaction to the case 's outcome			1
@entity40 said his client was ' appalled by the lack of accountability ' and said the case 's outcome was a result of a ' flawed military system ' and a failed investigation			0
the woman , who testified for more than five hours , said she drank heavily before and during the ' @entity50 ' party , which was held off - campus near the school in @entity52 , @entity53			2
she said she could n't remember having sex with @entity18 - but when she found an open condom wrapper and began hearing rumors about her having sex with multiple people at the party , she asked him			1
scene : the party was held at a house near the @entity5 in @entity52 , @entity53 , pictured			0
the woman said she was so drunk that she could not have consented to sex with @entity18 ' what you do n't remember ? ' he said , she claimed			1
' i 'm going to have to refresh your memory			0
' initially , she did not cooperate with investigators and held back information because she wanted the case to go away and did not want to disappoint her mother , she said			0
but after the investigation was closed , she had a change of heart and it was reopened			0
prosecutors had tried to show that the alleged victim was too drunk to consent to sexual activity - and was so drunk she could not walk , talk or make decisions clearly			1
but two men who had been initially accused in the case denied that she had been that drunk			2
one of the men , @entity85 from @entity86 , @entity87 , told the court that the woman had also performed oral sex on him in a car at the party			2
during the incident , which occurred after she had allegedly had sex with @entity18 in the car , the woman also asked @entity85 to have sex , he claimed			1
he added that the woman did not appear ' dangerously intoxicated ' and was in control of her body			0
teammate : football players @entity102 , left , and @entity85 , right , were also initially accused of sexual assault after @entity102 had sex with the woman in a bathroom and @entity85 received oral sex from her another football player who was also initially accused , @entity102 from @entity108 , @entity109 , agreed that she was ' in control of her movements and her speech '			1
the couple , who had recently ended a casual relationship , had also had sex that night			2
the morning after the party , she woke up on a couch with an aching back and asked another @entity5 football player to feel the knots in her back			0
about 45 minutes later , she and the player had consensual sex			0
afterwards , he suggested they take a ride back to the @entity5 with his friends and when she climbed in the car , she recognized it from the night before - and saw an opened condom wrapper			2
when she returned to campus , she confronted @entity18 , who admitted they had had sex			1
@entity102 and @entity85 were also initially accused of sexually assaulting the woman but @entity18 was the only student ultimately brought to court - martial , the military 's equivalent of a trial			1
the military held an @entity138 , which resembles a preliminary hearing in civilian court , in august and september of 2013			0
not charged : @entity102 and @entity85 , pictured , denied that the woman was ' too intoxicated ' to consent following that hearing , the academy 's head , vice admiral @entity143 , decided not to pursue charges against @entity102 , saying there were no ' reasonable grounds ' to believe he committed a crime			1
charges against @entity85 were dropped in january , which prosecutors had recommended after a military judge said statements he made during an investigation would not be admissible during a military trial			0
just hours before the verdict on thursday , a separate court - martial unfolding in @entity157 , @entity158 also ended in favor of the defense			2
gen. @entity163 was reprimanded and docked four months ' pay but avoided prison time for carrying on a three - year affair with a captain who later claimed she had been sexually assaulted			0
the two cases underscore the military 's attempts to grapple with sexual misconduct within its ranks			0
a @entity174 report released last year estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted in the prior year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward out of fear their careers might be derailed .			0

@entity2 was acquitted of aggravated sexual assault on thursday
he had sex with a woman at a party in 2012 - but she claimed she was so drunk that she could not remember it and had been unable to consent
she only found out the next day when she confronted @entity18 after hearing rumors about her having sex with multiple people that night
his friends - including 2 who also had sexual contact with her that night - denied that she had been too drunk to consent
she is ' appalled and disappointed ' by the verdict , her lawyer said
