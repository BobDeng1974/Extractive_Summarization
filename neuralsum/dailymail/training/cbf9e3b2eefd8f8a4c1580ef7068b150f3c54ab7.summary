@entity1 @entity0 wore the referee 's kit , but he was n't in charge for this quarter final in @entity6			1
the refereeing at this @entity8 has been consistently lenient			1
teams will have noted that and now know that they have a licence to foul , particularly gifted opponents like @entity13			2
time and time again the dangerous @entity13 was blocked , tripped and body checked			2
yet , @entity15 and his @entity17 team - mates escaped sanction			1
what the @entity20 man has to do to get a yellow card at this tournament i do not know			0
a caution for the defender and a retake was the correct decision			0
with the hosts a goal up but facing a determined @entity46 side they elected to ignore the beautiful game and resort to foul tactics to progress to the semi-final			0
the second half of a promising game deteriorated into a petty ugly affair in which @entity54 was happy to award free - kicks but nothing else – until it was too late			0
frustratingly when @entity13 committed a minor foul , he was cautioned adding fuel to the fire that @entity17 are enjoying every perceived advantage of being a home team			1
if this continues they must surely lift their sixth @entity8			2
that @entity65 scored the winner from the free - kick added insult to injury			0
finally : @entity70 and @entity71 were booked as the referee eventually got tough with hosts @entity17 paying the price : @entity13 fouled @entity75 for the free kick that led to @entity65 's goal in the book : @entity13 was also booked as @entity29 were sent crashing out by the hosts on friday while @entity54 did nothing to impress his assistant worked well and rightly flagged for offside to disallow @entity84 effort			1
it is hard to give @entity54 any credit for finally giving a decision against @entity17 when @entity70 hacked @entity88 down			0
@entity0 made his name in @entity90 for being a strict disciplinarian but @entity93 instructions have clearly affected a number of referees in this tournament and it is highly unlikely that will change in the remaining six games			0
the question now is whether the referee for @entity17 ’s semi-final will be strong enough to ensure fair play – and that referee could well be @entity104 .			1
