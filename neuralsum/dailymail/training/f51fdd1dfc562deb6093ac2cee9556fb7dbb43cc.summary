shoppers can buy the likes of muesli , rice and pasta by directly helping themselves from the large store containers , filling their own boxes before getting them weighed at the till			2
for beer and red wine , it 's the same thing - ' bring - your - own ' bottles are just fine , while vodka is even stored in a big demijohn from which customers can buy a few shots , or more			2
when customers are done , they bring their containers of food up to the tills to be weighed the forward - thinking shop has a very ' old school ' feel , but is very much a progressive initiative an assortment of jams and spreads at the store , which has gone down well with @entity29 locals the store also sells washing up liquid and toiletries in bulk , with shoppers helping themselves to shampoo using the tap on a 10 - litre ( 2.6 - gallon ) tin , while toothpaste comes in tablet form			1
the shop 's lay - out and decor make you almost expect an old - fashioned storekeeper in a striped apron and with a pencil behind his ear to appear			0
but its mission is all about forward thinking , by encouraging ' precycling ' , a preventive form of environmentalism , as opposed to just recycling already used packaging , @entity34 , 31 , the other co-founder , said			0
shampoo comes in huge vats , which can then be siphoned into smaller containers by customers toothpaste is even bought in tablets , so that there is none wasted and no packaging to throw away @entity22 throw away an average of 16 million tonnes of rubbish a year , the @entity118 says @entity22 throw away 16 million tonnes on average of rubbish a year , according to the @entity118			1

customers seemed taken with the @entity29 store			2
' our society worries far too little about the problem of plastics , ' complained @entity136 , a shopper in her 40s , who said she planned to get her groceries at the new shop ' from time to time '			0
