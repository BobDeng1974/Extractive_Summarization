@entity1 's new team played its first ever match against @entity3 with their big - name signing 45 miles away in @entity6			1
the @entity8 legend was supposed to join @entity9 last month ahead of their inaugural @entity11 season			1
but while @entity14 's @entity13 franchise made their debut in a friendly with the buddies at the parent club 's @entity18 , @entity1 was relaxing an hour away down the @entity20 in a hotel as @entity23 's men look to get their season back on track at the @entity26			2
@entity27 impressed as he scored on his debut for his new club since joining on a free transfer the @entity32 winner leads his side out for @entity9 's first ever game as a professional club @entity14 have faced the music for keeping @entity1 for the rest of the season as they look to retain their @entity40 title but officials put a brave face on his absence from last night 's inaugural gig for the @entity13 offshoot			1
they were keen to point out that @entity1 has been to a number of training sessions as his new pals made the most of @entity14 's Â£ 200m facilities and added that he had even enjoyed a couple of getting - to - know - you beers			2
one man who did make his debut on a chilly night in @entity56 was former @entity57 striker @entity27			0
@entity58 ( centre ) breaks the deadlock with a clincial finish against @entity62 side @entity3 the twinkle - toed 33 - year - old has graced some of the world 's biggest stages but this was a low key introduction in front of around 2,000 supporters on the site of an old dyeworks who , given @entity14 's difficulties in front of goal , may have wished he was plying his trade across the road			1
there was an air of inevitability that @entity58 would break the deadlock and he got his chance on 27 minutes when two buddies defenders made a hash of clearing a cross from the left			0
@entity58 , with the freedom of @entity56 , span on the ball before clinically side footing past @entity92			2
@entity9 celebrated their first ever victory , even with a missing @entity1 , with a good performance the @entity96 and @entity97 man has @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity32 winners medals in his collection and he will now go down in history as the man who scored the @entity105 's first ever goal thanks to a gift from the @entity107			1
but @entity27 was given a reminder that the @entity109 were not here just to make friends moments later when he nutmegged battle - hardened midfielder @entity112 only for the @entity113 to return the favour and happily point out that the scores between the pair were now level			0
@entity58 exited at the break , one of nine changes while @entity121 came off for the designated visitors			0
@entity123 ( left ) holds off @entity9 's @entity124 at the @entity125 despite the mass substitutions the @entity11 side found another gear and deservedly doubled their lead when @entity130 nipped in behind the @entity109 defence to emphatically volley a second			1
that was that and the players exited to the strains of @entity137 's @entity136			0
elephant in the room aside , officials will have been pleased with a winning debut			0
@entity130 ( right ) fires home to seal the win for @entity9 in @entity56 in front of an intrigued crowd this was not @entity146 this was @entity56 but @entity149 's men made themselves at home and appeared well - drilled for a hastily put together team			2
they will be back at the @entity153 to take on @entity155 outfit @entity156 before kicking off their season against fellow new boys @entity159			0
coach @entity149 believes @entity1 's expected arrival , in june or july , will give his men a shot in the arm as they look to make the play - offs in their debut season			1
on the evidence of this knockabout , he might be right			0
@entity58 ( right ) battles with @entity112 as he proved that he still has plenty to offer the @entity11 newcomers			1

@entity58 scored for @entity9 as they beat @entity3 at the @entity125
@entity1 's new side comfortably beat the @entity175 outfit
@entity1 is expected to arrive in june or july to boost the new @entity11 side
