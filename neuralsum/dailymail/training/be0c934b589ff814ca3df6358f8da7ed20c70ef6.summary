by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:17 pm on 22nd july 2011 the @entity3 's biggest rooftop solar plant - the size of two - and - a - half football pitches - has been unveiled			1
costing £ 4million , the 7,000 panels have been installed at the @entity8 plastics plant near @entity9 , @entity10			1
with a capacity of @entity13 , the panels produce enough energy to power 480 homes			1
harvester : the @entity3 's biggest rooftop solar plant - the size of 2.5 football pitches - at the @entity8 plastics plant near @entity9 , @entity10 the @entity3 's largest solar roof installation went live in time to beat a @entity21 deadline next week to withdraw feed - in tariff funding for larger sized schemes			1
@entity25 , engineering manager at @entity8 , said : ' this is really another step along the path of commitment to reduce our impact on the environment and this is the most significant step @entity32 has done in the last 12 months			2
' almost all of the power produced from the sun 's energy falling on the plant roof will be used on - site , with any surplus feeding into the national grid			2
the scheme was paid for by hundreds of small investors from across the @entity3 who contributed sums starting at £ 3,000			1
they were brought together by fund manager @entity45 to cash in on a government subsidised scheme , that has now had its rules changed to allow individual households to benefit			2
the installation was developed by @entity53 , a renewable energy installer and operator , and built by @entity56 , a @entity58 engineering and architectural consultancy which specialises in green power generation			2
blue - sky thinking : the @entity3 's biggest roof - top solar plant in @entity9 , @entity10 @entity63 , chief executive of @entity53 , said : ' this roof - top solar plant highlights the important role solar generation has to play in our future energy mix , particularly when the energy it produces is used at source , removing the need for wasteful distribution networks			0
' ' getting this site online before the august deadline was a considerable achievement and it is a real credit to @entity56 , for their speed and coordination during design and construction , and to @entity8 as a company for their commitment to the project and a willingness to do what was needed to get it completed			0
' @entity88 , managing director of @entity89 said : ' the @entity8 installation is n’t just a great achievement in its own right , but also a validation that @entity89 can deliver to its investors what we said we would			0
given the tight deadline set by the government , we were one of very few investment houses able to provide funding for solar projects such as this one			0
' however , none of it could have been done without the support from our investors , who recognised that solar offers a unique opportunity to benefit from @entity21 - approved incentives by investing as little as £ 3,000			1
' it is the largest initiative of its kind to date and changes to @entity21 subsidies are expected to limit future developments on this scale			0
ministers were becoming concerned that solar farm developers would drain the limited funds that are primarily intended for domestic rooftop installations			0
the government has dramatically reduced the subsidies available for any solar scheme over @entity124 coming online after august 1 , so it is likely that this will be the @entity3 ’s largest roof - top installation ever .			0

the size of 2.5 football pitches
it cost £ 4million , and is made up of 7,000 panels
it has a generating capacity of @entity13
