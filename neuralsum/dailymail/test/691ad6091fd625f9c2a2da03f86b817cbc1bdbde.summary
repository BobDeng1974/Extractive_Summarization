a father who walked out of a secretive @entity2 commune where everyone wears blue uniforms and birth control is non-existent said living in the community was like being in a scary thriller movie			1
@entity8 , 26 , left @entity9 , a town of about 500 on @entity12 's west coast , with his wife , @entity14 , 29 , and their children in late march 2013			1
shortly following their departure , the family watched the 2004 psychological thriller @entity20 , by @entity22			1
mr @entity8 said the film - where residents of a pretend 19th century town fear the ' wicked ' outside world - was a ' good comparison with our community ' , especially in their views of the greater world			1
' ( in the film ) , all the kids have grown up and been told the outside is unsafe			0
they even make their own scare tactics to scare people from going outside the wee village , ' he said			2
' it 's kind of the same thing here			0
you 're told if you leave @entity9 you 're lost , you lose your @entity40			1
' life in @entity9 : wearing their customary blue uniforms , @entity8 , now 26 , wife @entity14 , now 29 and two of the three children they left with are photographed inside the commune @entity9 baby : daughter honour is pictured decked out in her @entity50 uniform young love : in @entity9 blue , @entity8 and @entity14 are pictured mucking around			1
@entity9 , a secretive @entity2 commune , is nestled on the banks of @entity55 on @entity12 's west coast living in the now : the @entity57 have lived outside @entity9 for two years sharing candid photographs of his family 's time in @entity9 with @entity62 , mr @entity8 said he had been told there was ' a lot of sin ' and ' bad things ' in the greater world			1
' you almost only get to know about the evil while you 're there			2
' that 's all you know to be outside @entity9 , is a lot of evil and that sort of thing			1
' but following their departure , the family were ' blown away ' by the kindness and support shown to them by @entity12 churches in @entity84 and @entity85			1
the latter town , some 300kms south of @entity9 , has become home to several former members of the sect recently following a virtual exodus			1
according to sunday @entity12 program , 22 residents have left in the past two months			1
among them includes the @entity96 family of 14 , who famously walked out this march			1
' when we left we received so much help and gifts from people especially churches at @entity84 and then at @entity85 , ' mr @entity8 told @entity62			1
' people ( were ) just helping us out giving us clothing , kitchen gear - heaps of stuff - and we were quite shocked with that			2
' we 've been blown away by how much love we 've received outside of there			0
even from people who are n't @entity110 , as well			2
' there 's a lot of really kind , caring people who want to help you			1
i mean , even in our district , you meet someone new and they just want to help			0
the family have faced two particular challenges leaving @entity9			1
the most devastating is that the couple are mostly unable to contact their large extended family inside the commune			1
' not being able to talk to them and see them is definitely the worst thing , ' said mr @entity8 , who is now managing a dairy farm and living in @entity85			1
' everyone can adapt into a different lifestyle			0
but you ca n't adapt from leaving your family			1
' a scene from the 2004 @entity22 film , @entity20			1
in the film , residents believed they were living in a 19th century village - but in reality the village had been founded in the 1970s in an interview , mr @entity8 compared the views residents in @entity50 had of the outside world with those held in the psychological thriller @entity20 ( above ) l love in @entity146 : @entity8 is pictured here with @entity14 in scenic @entity9 one of the @entity149 's little boys , @entity150 , is pictured at @entity9 love in @entity146 : @entity14 is photographed here with three children , @entity150 ( left ) , @entity153 the deeply religious family were also forced to grapple with their views about @entity157			1
they were particularly afraid that , by walking out of @entity9 they may have lost their ' @entity40 ' with @entity160			2
' i guess the biggest thing , other than leaving family , was feeling like our salvation was lost			2
' for us , we felt that was the worst thing			0
especially my wife really struggled with that			2
' it was n't until we got good teaching from the pastor at our church and he taught us through the @entity173 really well so we could be confident that @entity9 was wrong and that we were actually free to go wherever we like ... ' that really gave us a lot of security in what we 've done			1
what we 've been told was n't true ... you still have to tell yourself that			0
' nestled on the banks of the picturesque @entity181 on @entity12 's rugged @entity182 , @entity9 is a @entity2 community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the @entity186			1
the community , which isolates itself from the outside world , was founded by @entity189 , a @entity190 evangelist			0
@entity189 moved across the @entity191 in 1969 with his wife , @entity192 , and their ten children to found a @entity2 community			1
as its membership swelled , in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off			0
mr @entity189 - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to ' @entity2 '			2
@entity205 , the author of the @entity9 book @entity207 , said the most striking thing about @entity9 was the ' control those in power ' - a group of elders - ' had over the ordinary people			1
'' ' the women , particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in @entity9 , ' ms @entity205 told @entity62			2
' @entity160 wants you to get married and have as many children as you can			0
that 's why they have big families			0
' residents are required to wear a uniform			0
women generally frock up in long , blue dresses - ' every single day ' , a former resident named @entity225 told @entity62			0
meanwhile , men wear neckties , dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt			0
and while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among ' ordinary people ' , ms @entity205 said the community was ' very innovative ' , with extensive commercial operations			0
residents do not take any wages , but work hard for the community 's dairy and deer farms.the community consists of more than 80 families , according to @entity9 's official website , and they live together in large , communal hostels			2
@entity248 , pictured , grew up in @entity9 and can be seen wearing her miniature blue uniform known by the name ' @entity2 ' , @entity189 ( pictured ) was convicted of sex abuse and spent 11 months in prison in 1995 mr @entity8 was initially kicked out of the @entity9 for five weeks around christmas 2012 after ' asking too many questions ' of the @entity255 , who rule the sect			1
among the matters he asked about was the history of founder @entity189 , who was convicted and spent nearly a year imprisoned on sex abuse charges in 1995 ' i do n't know what really turned the corner with them			0
' i guess the main thing is i even had the guts or whatever it was to ask them , to question it			0
' it might seem strange looking in from out there			0
( but ) growing up there you 're real scared of them ( the @entity255 ) , scared of getting in trouble with them			0
' it was quite a courageous move to ask questions of them			0
' after five weeks of ' hell ' separated from his family , mr @entity8 ' repented ' for his sins and returned home to @entity9			1
but the family soon decided to pick up and leave			0
in @entity9 , women are required to wear a blue , full - length robe ( pictured in a documentary above ) @entity9 families live together in large , communal hostels one of the reasons the @entity57 decided to leave @entity9 was to spend more time with their children , rather than them being ' raised as a part of a system ' mr @entity8 , who had worked outside @entity9 , particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up			1
' i worked outside @entity9 , " sharemilking " on a neighbour 's farm for the community			2
it was kind of then i thought i 'd like my own house and things			0
' and i 'd like to look after my kids personally			0
there ( in @entity9 ) your kids are raised by the system i guess			2
' school , pre-school children go to pre-school - you do n't really get a whole lot of time with them			0
' with a farming lifestyle , you get to spend a bit more time with your children			0
you have a bigger input in their lives			0
mr @entity8 , who had worked outside @entity9 , particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up @entity9 is located on @entity55 , on the west coast of @entity12 's @entity323			1
many families have left for @entity85 , around 300kms south he told @entity62 one of his ' biggest issues ' with @entity9 is how they separate dissenters from their families			1
' that 's the biggest thing i want to see stopped			0
i had a guy working for me for a while - he 's got back in now			0
' he was out for six months , away from his wife and family			2
he had three little children			0
' it 's that sort of behaviour i want to see stopped			0
' mr @entity8 now manages a dairy farm with more than 700 cows			2
he said the family , who now have two more children , had ' definitely ' adjusted to life in @entity85			1
' we 've been doing well			0
' @entity62 approached @entity9 for comment but did not receive a response			2
the ' @entity96 ' family of fourteen , pictured , left @entity9 for @entity85 in march 2015			1
@entity62 understands they have settled in well			0

@entity8 and his wife @entity14 walked out of @entity9
it is a secretive @entity2 commune on the @entity12 @entity182
he said @entity22 movie @entity20 is a ' good comparison '
' all you know to be outside @entity9 is a lot of evil '
he was initially kicked out for ' asking too many questions '
after leaving @entity9 , family grappled with religious fears
people opened their homes , hearts and *wallets* to the @entity50 *refugees*
a @entity85 church has been *instrumental* in settling the family
there has recently been an exodus from @entity9
