gut bacteria may be responsible for thousands of heart attacks - particularly in people who have no obvious risk factors for heart disease , such as high cholesterol			1
scientists have discovered that certain gut flora turn a nutrient found in egg yolks , liver , beef , pork , pork and wheatgerm into the compound @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
@entity16 makes blood cholesterol build up on artery walls , causing hardening of the arteries			1
if this buildup breaks away and blocks an artery , it usually results in a stroke or heart attack			0
the study found that organisms in our gut may be responsible for converting some foods into toxic chemicals the new study built on a 2011 research on lab mice			1
carried out by the @entity36 's @entity35 , scientists asked 40 healthy adults to eat two hard - boiled eggs , which are rich in a fatty substance called lecithin			0
after eating the eggs , the blood levels of @entity16 became raised			0
but if participants took antibiotics - which kill bacteria in the gut - before eating the eggs , their tmao levels were suppressed , the researchers found			1
‘ this showed that intestinal bacteria are essential for forming @entity16 , ’ dr. @entity48 , a cardiologist at the @entity36 , told @entity49			1
next , to see whether @entity16 predicts cardiovascular events , the researchers measured its levels in 4,007 heart patients			0
after taking age and a past heart attacks into account , they found that high levels of @entity16 were predictive of heart attack , stroke and death over the three years that the patients were followed			1
participants who had a heart attack , stroke or died during the study had higher than average @entity16 levels than those who did n't			2
in fact , those who possessed the highest tmao levels had more than twice the risk of a heart attack or stroke compared to people in the bottom quartile			0
the study asked volunteers to eat eggs , which contain high levels of lethicin , a precursor to harmful @entity16 and even people with high @entity16 levels and no cardiovascular risk factors were 1.8 times more likely to experience a cardiovascular event than those with low levels			1
the findings suggest @entity16 could serve as a marker for predicting heart disease although more studies are required to confirm the link , said the paper published in the @entity91			0
if the findings are confirmed , it is hoped that researchers will be able to develop a drug that blocks the production of @entity16			0
earlier this month , the same researchers published a study that found a link between consumption of a chemical called carnitine , which is found in red meat , and a risk of heart disease			2
carnitine is also converted by bacteria to @entity16			2
the study joins a growing list of findings that link microbes in the gut , nose and genital tract , and on the skin to health and disease			2
research has shown that certain species of gut bacteria protect against asthma while others affect the risk of obesity			0
last week scientists reported that circumcision alters bacteria in the penis , and that this helps protect men from sexually transmitted disease .			0

study has found that bugs in gut are responsible for converting food into harmful compound called @entity16
@entity16 is a compound responsible for cholesterol building up on artery walls and hardening the arteries
adds to research that bacteria , both on and inside the body , play vital role in our health
