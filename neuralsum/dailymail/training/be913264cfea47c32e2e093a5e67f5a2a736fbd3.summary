by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:17 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 13 march 2013 under - 30s are to be offered more help to buy their first home , @entity2 suggested today as he sought to revive @entity7 as a ‘ property owning democracy ’			2
the prime minister used a major speech on the economy to warn the average first - time buyer is now 33 years old if they are unable to draw on financial help from their parents			1
with less than two weeks before the @entity17 , mr @entity2 vowed he was ‘ determined to tackle ’ the housing crisis and suggested a fresh package of help could is being drawn up by ministers			0
@entity2 used a speech in @entity23 , @entity24 to rule out a shift in economic strategy , but hinted at more help for first - time buyers speaking in @entity24 , mr @entity2 said there was no ‘ magic money tree ’ that allowed the government to spend and borrow more			1
he rejected calls both from @entity34 mps for unfunded tax cuts and from @entity37 minister @entity36 for more borrowing , warning any move to abandon the austerity programme would mean ‘ interest rates will rise , homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust ’			1
he added : ‘ even just a one per cent rise in mortgage interest rates would cost the average family £ 1,000 in extra debt service payments			1
’ the prime minister warned the dream of home ownership was no beyond too many people , despite a raft of government schemes to help people on to the housing ladder			1
the prime minister warned abandoning @entity60 would mean interest rates will rise , homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust ‘ we do n’t want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and encouraging people to take on borrowing that they ca n’t afford			1
‘ but it is important that people who work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that the average age for someone buying their first home today , without any help from their parents is 33 years old			1
and we are determined to tackle that			0
’ since 2005 , the average age for all first - time buyers has remained almost unchanged at 29			1
but for those buying without any financial help , it has risen ‘ sharply ’ from 30 in early 2008 to 33 , the @entity85 found			2
the government last year launched its funding for lending scheme , which aimed to encourage banks to lend more money to both individuals and businesses			0
mr @entity2 claimed that as a result , the cost of a two - year fixed rate £ 100,000 mortgage with a 10 per cent deposit is now £ 1,000 cheaper than when the scheme was launched			2
the @entity100 added : ‘ it is now possible to buy a new home anywhere in the country with only a 5 % deposit , and at very low interest rates			1
’ mortgage lending will rise this year by £ 10 billion for the first time since the financial crisis , according to industry predictions			2
while the average age of all first - time buyers has remained stable at around 29 , for those without financial help it has risen sharply to 33 ‘ and as we look ahead to the @entity17 we will consider whether there is more we can do to build on this success , ’ mr @entity2 added , in the strongest hint yet of a new package of help for first - time buyers			1
he also hailed the @entity121 scheme which helps people with smaller deposits to buy a newly built home and the @entity125 is offering offered guarantees for more housing and infrastructure			2
however , @entity130 's shadow chancellor @entity129 said : ' families , pensioners and businesses across @entity7 will wonder what planet @entity2 is on			0
' he claims the economy is getting better and his plan is working , but everyone else knows that the economy is flatlining , living standards are falling and the deficit is rising to pay for the costs of economic failure			1
' speaking at precision grinding engineers @entity145 , mr @entity2 said there were ' signs that our plan is beginning to work ' , with jobs being created and the economy rebalancing mr @entity2 used his pre-budget speech to warn @entity7 must stick to its deficit reduction programme or risk being plunged ‘ back into the abyss ’			2
' there are some people who think we do n't have to take all these tough decisions to deal with our debts , ' he said			0
' they say that our focus on deficit reduction is damaging growth			0
and what we need to do is to spend more and borrow more			0
' it 's as if they think there 's some magic money tree			0
well , let me tell you a plain truth : there is n't			0
' @entity174 understood that a tax cut paid for by borrowed money is no tax cut at all when she said : " i ’ve not been prepared , ever , to go on with tax reductions if it meant unsound finance "			0
' mr @entity2 added : ' so yes , we are doing a great deal to help hard working families			0
but all of these changes have to be paid for – and they have been paid for			0
' the remarks will be seen as a sharp rebuttal to the calls from both @entity188 and @entity37 for a change of direction			1
business secretary @entity36 used a magazine article to suggest extra borrowing could be used to fund news infrastructure projects right wing conservatives have demanded a raft of tax cuts designed to stimulate the economy , argue the @entity125 would recoup the money as firms hired more people			1
and on the other side of the argument , business secretary @entity36 has broken ranks to suggest capital spending , funded by borrowing , may be needed to kick - start growth			1
he told the @entity207 that the government ’s decision to stick to @entity130 ’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘ economic consequences ’			1
mr @entity36 said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the government should ‘ borrow more , at very low interest rates , in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges , small road and rail projects , more prudential borrowing by councils for house building			1
’ he told the magazine that the strategy ‘ does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit , and may assist it by reviving growth ’			0
mr @entity2 was later asked about mr @entity36 's intervention			2
the prime minister said : ' the article he wrote in the @entity207 was cleared and approved by the @entity125			1
' he backs the measures we are taking on dealing with the budget deficit and also he is playing a very key role in making sure we deliver this agenda of backing the fastest growing areas of our economy that have real potential for the future			0
i work very closely with him in doing that			0
' earlier , mr @entity36 also played down the idea that his comments represented a shift in policy , telling the @entity249 : ' we just need to pursue what i 've often called @entity252			2
that is financial discipline and getting down the deficit and at the same time pursuing growth			0
that 's what we are doing and will continue to do			0
