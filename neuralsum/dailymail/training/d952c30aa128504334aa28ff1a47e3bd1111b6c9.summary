by @entity0 the @entity3 martial arts instructor who tried to frame an @entity4 of sending ricin - laced letters to the president has tried to change his original guilty plea by saying that he wants a chance to prove his innocence			1
@entity10 pleaded guilty in january to sending the tainted letters to @entity12 as well as @entity13 senator @entity13 and @entity3 judge @entity14			1
he was set to be sentenced tuesday in @entity15 , @entity3 but when he was in court , he told @entity18 district judge @entity17 that he is innocent and wanted a chance to prove it			0

@entity10 said he was making a harmless organic fertilizer not poisonous ricin			1
he was so confident that the substance was harmless that he offered prosecutors a ' free shot ' by letting him eat the remaining substance that 's in evidence			1
' i will dump the contents of the two remaining letters on a peanut butter sandwich and eat it and wash it down with a glass of chocolate milk , ' @entity10 said			1
@entity46 , the chief federal prosecution in the case , said there was not perjury			0
' the defendant is simply mistaken , ' mr @entity46 told @entity52			0
hoping for freedom : @entity10 originally entered a guilty plea for sending ricin - laced letters to the president and other officials but said in his sentencing on tuesday that he wants to change that ( pictured in april 2013 ) ' the mask he threw in the coffee grinder box was the mask that tested positive			1

rivals : @entity10 , a martial arts instructor ( left ) , tried framing his longtime enemy @entity86 ( right ) , an @entity4 , of sending the letters last spring prosecutors in that case said @entity10 was trying to frame @entity86 , a longtime enemy and @entity4 , who was briefly jailed before @entity10 was jailed in his place			1

today 's court appearance and his attempt to change his plea in connection to the ricin plot is not expected to have an effect on his admission of guilt for fondling three girls , who were 8 - to 10 - years - old when the incidents occurred from 2007 to 2013 .			2
