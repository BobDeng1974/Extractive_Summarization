@entity9 said schools had been ‘ surprised ’ after ‘ two decades of grade inflation ’ were finally brought under control			0

heads and teachers denounced the report as a ‘ whitewash ’ and renewed threats of legal action against exam boards			2

' grade robbers ' : headteachers today warned they could still mount a legal challenge over gcse @entity15 as @entity9 said that this summer 's results will not be re-graded under pressure : education secretary @entity23 ( pictured ) has been called on to make a statement to @entity58 on monday about how the government intends to address concerns about gcse @entity15 @entity62 , now that @entity9 has published its findings , is that the end of the matter , then ? no. the unions are generally unhappy about @entity9 's stance			1
the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) maintains that there has been a ' systemic failure ' in the awarding of gcse @entity15 grades			1
they are most concerned that thousands of students who should have got a c in their @entity76 instead got a @entity77 , generally considered a fail , even though officially it is a pass , and that it could affect their chances of getting into the sixth - form college , or gaining an apprenticeship			0
q. what do the unions want to happen ? there have been calls for results to be re-graded and @entity9 to reconsider its findings			0
they say it is ' wholly unacceptable to leave the students and their teachers to pick up the pieces of a problem they did not cause ' and that ' it is not acceptable or practicable to make the students resit examinations '			1
they also say that the grade boundaries should have not have been moved during the academic year amid fears that too many children were going to get a @entity103 q. what will happen now ? @entity9 says it will continue to go through any further evidence with unions and talk to them about wider issues around exams and gradings , as well as information and advice to teachers and schools			2

each exam board set standards for the qualifications in the manner expected			0
’ in a concession , @entity9 said it would allow pupils , as a one - off , an extra , earlier resit opportunity in november			2
but this will come as little comfort to those who were supposed to be starting sixth - form or college courses on monday and missed the c grades they needed to confirm places			0

headache : teachers claim the grade boundary changes during the year have disadvantaged certain groups of students concern focused on @entity15 after the @entity167 pass mark dropped 1.5 points – from 65.4 to 63.9 per cent			1
c grades in the subject are demanded by many employers and universities while schools risk closure or being taken over if they persistently fail to bring enough pupils up to the standard			0
@entity9 said : ‘ we know that schools and colleges will be disappointed with our conclusions			0
‘ many will have been hoping that we would conclude that the june grade boundaries were too harsh , and that we should return to the january boundaries			1
' doing so would undermine standards and damage confidence			0
’ but @entity186 of the @entity67 , said : ‘ there has been a systemic failure over the awarding of @entity6 grades			2
