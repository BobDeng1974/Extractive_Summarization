by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:06 pm on 3rd october 2011 veteran broadcaster and @entity4 's leading grumpy old man @entity3 delivered his final weekly essay on sunday after 33 years of appearances on the @entity7 show 60 minutes			1
he began his weekly show ' a few minutes with @entity3 ' in 1978 at the age of 59 after years working behind the scenes as a writer for tv and radio			1
in his 1097th and final essay he described himself not as a ' television personality , ' but as ' a writer who reads what he 's written			1
' i wish i could do this forever			1
but i 'm not retiring			1
writers do n't retire , and i 'll always be a writer			1
' a writer 's job is to tell the truth			1
i know i 've been terribly wrong sometimes , but i think i 've been right more than i 've been wrong			2
' @entity28 said he has lived a lucky life , luckier than most			2
but befitting his trademark crotchety nature , he voiced one parting complaint : he does n't like being famous , nor does he like being bothered by fans			2
' i spent my first 50 years trying to become well known as a writer , and the next 30 trying to avoid being famous , ' he said			1
' i walk down the street now or go to a football game and people shout , " hey , @entity3 ! " and i hate that			2
' so if you see him in a restaurant , @entity28 said as he signed off , ' please , just let me eat my dinner			2
' @entity45 chairman @entity44 paid tribute to his long career saying : ' there 's nobody like @entity3 , and there never will be			2
he 'll hate hearing this , but he 's an @entity4 original			0
' @entity28 had been a contributor to 60 minutes since the show 's debut			0
during its first season in 1968 he appeared a few times in silhouette with @entity61 , 60 minutes senior producer , in a short - lived segment called @entity63 and @entity64			0
he joined @entity7 in 1949 as a writer for @entity67 's @entity66 , a hit show of that day and also wrote for the @entity69 ( 1959 - 65 ) , a popular variety show			1
impressive : @entity28 's career as a writer for @entity7 began in 1949 at the same time , he was writing for @entity45 public - affairs broadcasts such as the @entity75 and @entity76			1
his skills as a writer and producer , not as the talking head he famously became later in life , were the roles he said he always valued most			0
' i obviously have a knack for getting on paper what a lot of people have thought and did n't realize they thought , ' he reflected during an interview in 1998			0
' and they say , " hey , yeah ! " and they like that			0
' before @entity28 delivered his final essay , @entity94 - himself an 89 - year - old journalist and a @entity97 staple since 1970 - interviewed @entity28 about his personal and professional life			1
@entity28 admitted that he does n't sign autographs and rarely responds to fan mail , telling @entity101 he did n't ' want to answer an idiot who would have the bad sense to write me a letter			0
' @entity28 has also engendered controversy , such as his weeks - long suspension in 1990 for remarks that offended some gay viewers			0
long time coming : @entity28 delivered his first essay on 60 minutes in 1978 at the age of 59 but he 's better known for his sharp commentaries and public persona as someone fed up with everything from desk clutter to chocolate chip cookies to door knobs			1
in his time at 60 minutes , @entity28 has also contributed many deeper pieces in the wake of events like the 1986 space shuttle challenger explosion , the 1995 @entity128 bombing and the shock and awe campaign to start the @entity130 -- a phrase he scathingly said ' makes us look like foolish braggarts '			0
@entity101 described his longtime colleague as ' @entity4 's favorite grouch - in - chief ' , saying @entity28 used his ' loud whiny voice ... speaking up for citizens fed up with everything '			0
' there have been many curmudgeons on television over its long history , ' @entity101 said affectionately			0
' none has been so long serving in that role as mr. @entity3			0
