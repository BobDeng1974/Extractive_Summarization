senior nationalists have drawn up plans to demand a £ 30billion ' divorce settlement ' from the @entity3 if @entity5 votes yes to independence			1
they want talks to begin ' within days ' of a @entity9 vote , expecting @entity10 to agree to what would be the most expensive break - up of any country in the history of international relations			1
the @entity0 will demand a share of every single asset owned by the @entity3 , from the @entity18 to the military bases in the @entity20			1
@entity5 has one - twelfth of the @entity3 's population , which the @entity40 believes would entitle @entity5 to claim a share worth just under £ 30billion			1
if @entity5 do vote @entity9 on thursday , @entity24 will immediately start demanding that @entity5 gets its share of these assets - even before the celebrations of his fellow @entity0 have died down			1
it is understood that senior nationalists expect the process to start as early as next monday - four days after the referendum			2
the @entity40 would then get its negotiating team in place , ready to start the preliminary talks on the break - up of the @entity3 - and they would expect the @entity3 government to do the same			0
claim : the @entity55 has been valued at more than £ 200million according to an official document dispute : the @entity18 is one of the @entity3 assets which the @entity5 nationalists believe they have a part - share in a senior figure in the @entity40 said yesterday : ' we are ready to go			1
we know who will be in our team			0
' @entity24 's senior aides have also been studying a little - known list of all the buildings , assets and equipment owned by the @entity30 at home and abroad			1
as a result , they believe they know exactly what is owned by the @entity30 and will submit a list of what they want to come to @entity5 on @entity77			2
' everything is in there , ' said an @entity40 insider			0
' the only thing is that the asset register has not been updated for a few years , so it is conceivable that many things in there will actually be worth more than the stated value in the document			0
' the items they believe they should get a share of include the @entity18 , the @entity91 in @entity92 and even @entity93			1
the @entity0 have warned they will walk away from the liabilities of the @entity3 - including its mountainous debt - unless they get thier way on a share of the assets			2
headquarters : 10 @entity93 , which this week flew the saltire flag , the assets of the @entity30 include every piece of military equipment as well as works of art on display at @entity3 bases around the world - and the @entity40 wants @entity5 to get its population share of each one			1
the list includes : the @entity113 made it clear before the campaign started that this would be the approach taken by @entity117 in any post-referendum negotiations			0
base : the @entity3 's military facilities on the @entity20 are also included in the list of assets a spokesman declared : ' @entity5 and @entity5 taxpayers have contributed to funding all the assets owned by the @entity3 state over many years			1
it is only fair and reasonable that @entity5 should receive a fair share of the value of these assets on independence			0
' indeed , the @entity40 asset - grabbing approach was laid out in its @entity133 on @entity134 , published last november			0
this made it clear that ministers would expect to get a population share of @entity3 assets and , while it would be impossible to give @entity5 an actual cut of every asset , @entity5 would expect at least the financial value of the country 's share of the @entity3 's assets			1
the @entity30 has refused to even admit that independence might cause the break - up of the @entity3 state and @entity3 governments has , at least publicly , refused to put contingency plans in place			2
but it is understood that @entity3 ministers now realise the scale of the negotiations they might have to enter into if @entity5 vote yes this week			2
some of the negotiations over the sharing out of the @entity3 's assets will be relatively straightforward			0
there are already many @entity3 government buildings in @entity5 which would immediately transfer over to the @entity113 after independence			0
but even if every building , every piece of equipment , artwork and asset in @entity5 was added up , it would still leave the @entity113 claiming a multi-billion share of the rest of the @entity3 's assets			1
nationalist negotiators expect their @entity3 counterparts to give @entity5 the cash value			0
but a @entity3 @entity30 spokesman did not accept that @entity5 would be given everything the @entity40 is demanding if @entity5 do leave the @entity3			2
he said : ' a vote to leave the @entity3 is a vote to leave its institutions			0
the division of assets and liabilities would be a matter for negotiation between the continuing @entity3 and an independent @entity5			0
