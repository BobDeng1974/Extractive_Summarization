there would have been no mercy in the dressing room			2
nothing is sacred in the team			2
when @entity6 first turned up at the @entity7 this week someone would have said : ‘ mind that locker , @entity9			1
’ it was here , of course , that @entity6 broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the @entity21 team			1
@entity6 has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the @entity21 cricket team @entity6 ( left ) clashed with @entity25 during the second test between @entity27 and @entity21 but @entity6 ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to @entity21 coach @entity29 only a slight niggle in his back might stop @entity32 playing here in @entity34 and i am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs			1
i like @entity32 and i like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who can not capture the imagination			0
he has something about him , as he showed when he was in @entity49 ’s face during the @entity51 series			0
he was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return			0
but i do believe he will need careful man - managing			0
@entity29 , @entity21 ’s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with @entity25 in the second test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right			1
the way he approached the @entity62 after that third - day salute was spot on			0
@entity21 must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on			1
it will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad			0
what @entity6 must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon - holed			1
he can be feisty and fiery as long as it ’s natural but his aggression has to be controlled			2
you want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets			0
@entity6 ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the @entity21 team @entity6 ( left ) congratulates @entity21 captain @entity85 after the side won the second test @entity21 want to have @entity6 in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally			1
there is an argument here to play the second spinner in @entity95 and if @entity21 went down that route in @entity97 the place of @entity6 or @entity99 would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible			1
this summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so @entity21 want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game			2
they can only get better and that ’s an exciting prospect .			0

@entity6 returns to the ground where he broke his wrist hitting a locker
he clashed with @entity27 *batsman* @entity112 in the second test
but his aggression , when controlled , is *important* to @entity21
