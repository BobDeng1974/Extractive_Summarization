@entity0 was not the only big winner following monday 's @entity3 championship game			1
in an upset even more surprising than the @entity8 victory over the slightly favored @entity9 , @entity4 , a 12 - year - old sixth grader from @entity5 , @entity6 , beat out 11.5million entries to win the annual @entity11			1
and for this impressive feat , @entity4 gets bragging rights and an amazing sense of accomplishment			0
but not the actual grand prize of a $ 20,000 @entity18 gift card and an all - inclusive trip for two to the @entity21 college basketball tournament in @entity22 this november			1
for that prize , valued at $ 30,000 , @entity4 would have to legally be an adult as contest rules state individuals must be at least 18 - years - old to qualify			1
' i was just talking to @entity11 and they said that i ’m underage and ca n’t get any of the prize and they ’re going to send some goodies even though i entered under my dad ’s consent , which i ’m pretty irritated about			2
' that being said , like any enterprising child , @entity4 does have an idea for the folks at @entity11 as it pertains to compensation for his historic fete			1
' for @entity11 , i came in first and this was a rare thing that you can rarely get and i still do n’t get anything and i think i deserve something out of it , ' @entity4 said			2
' even if i just get an xbox or something			0
' @entity4 's plan may not work however , as it would have taken a second amazing feat for him to actually win the prize , with the top 1percent of entries being entered for a random drawing , which in this case would put his odds at roughly 1 in 115,000			1
as for his strategy , @entity4 seemed to adopt a seldom seen cool and relaxed approach when it came to making his picks , and says he was barely even aware how well he was doing			0
' i did n’t really pay attention to my bracket until the @entity68 when i went on my phone and realized , " woah , i ’m in sixth place , " ' said @entity4			2
' then i zoned into those games and realized , " hey , i have a chance here			0
" ' @entity4 should now be eligible for the $ 30,000 grand prize of a $ 20,000 @entity18 gift card and an all - inclusive trip to @entity22 this november , but is too young he 's got it : with a few minor exceptions , @entity4 picked a remarkably accurate bracket who was , including 100percent correct from the @entity81 onward			1
he only had two teams wrong in the @entity83 @entity4 is not the only winner going home empty handed either , as under @entity3 guidelines college athletes can not accept any forms of payment or gifts , which means the boys from @entity0 also head home with no prize money or @entity92			1
though , to put things in perspective , @entity4 had to deal with approximately 11,499,936 more competitors than any of the teams in the tournament			0
@entity4 is also helping out all those adults who obsessed over their brackets and then became irrationally angry as their teams lost by offering some helpful tips to make next year better			2
' just pick the team that you like and pick whoever you want , ' he said			0
' you never know what ’s going to happen in @entity106 so just pick teams that you really like			0
' @entity11 might be smart to give the level - headed kid who knows his college basketball a job as a commentator at next year 's tournament instead of that xbox			0
assuming he is old enough .			0

@entity4 beat out 11.5million entries to win the @entity11 on monday
this as he selected @entity0 to win the @entity3 title game , which they did by overcoming the @entity9 68 - 63
@entity4 should now be eligible for the $ 30,000 grand prize of a $ 20,000 @entity18 gift card and an all - inclusive trip to @entity22 this november
@entity4 , 12 , is not eligible however because age *restrictions* state that entrants must be 18 years old
@entity4 says he does not mind *missing* the prize , and though he is a little ' irritated ' he thinks the best idea if for @entity11 to *reward* him with an @entity113
the sixth grader also shared one of his bracket tips ; ' just pick the team that you like and pick whoever you want '
