by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the @entity3 players liked @entity4 , but knew results were n't good enough			1
there was a feeling among some members of the squad that a change was needed			0
but when it came , they did n't expect @entity13 , a man who had no senior football management experience , to be @entity4 's replacement			1
needless to say , the change has n't worked and @entity3 now face a summer of transition			1
@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 are among those who want to leave this summer			1
let 's go back to @entity4 's sacking on april 6			2
it 's funny how words can come back to bite you on the backside			0
' we will stay up - but we 've made this change with that in mind , ' said @entity3 chief executive @entity46 in explaining his decision to sack @entity4 and replace him with rookie boss @entity13			1
only a miracle can save the @entity3 from returning to the championship now			1
they have to beat @entity51 on sunday , hope @entity52 defeat @entity53 at the @entity54 - and then hope for a 17 goal swing			0
for all intents and purposes , @entity3 are relegated			1
but who is to blame ? @entity4 can take a share , as should the players			2
but @entity46 's contribution should n't be under estimated			0
the man to come back ? @entity63 are interesting in buying back striker @entity21 from the @entity3 wanting out : @entity64 ( left ) and @entity20 also want to leave @entity65 this summer and the players know it , too			1
certain members of the @entity3 squad have been left bewildered at the utter indecision from @entity46 over the past 12 months and believe he has contributed significantly to their downfall			2
the first real doubts over @entity4 's reign emerged towards the end of last season			2
despite leading @entity3 to an excellent 11th place in their second season back in the top - flight , the @entity3 board were not happy			2
a lack of goals and what was perceived as a negative style of play were causes for concern despite their healthy league position			0
@entity46 even canvassed opinion from the playing squad about @entity4 's reign last april - with the majority of them providing a healthy reference of their manager			2
nevertheless , since then @entity4 had been fire fighting ; keeping the wolves from his door at a game at a time			0
the club were privately planning for life without @entity4			1
@entity3 legend @entity104 - who was manager at @entity105 at the time - was a favourite among the @entity3 hierarchy			0
if there had been a realistic chance of luring him away from @entity110 , then @entity46 would have jumped at it			0
@entity112 day : @entity46 made the decision to get rid of @entity4 so late in the doomed season it was hoped the signings of attacking talent such as @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity21 would help @entity4 build a more expansive and attacking team			1
but their fears over negative tactics re-surfaced again following a disappointing start to the season that saw them score just six goals in their opening nine @entity130 games			0
@entity46 was ready to pull the trigger , but a 3 - 1 win over @entity133 in november saved hughton.another dreadful run of one win and just five goals in 11 matches put @entity4 's job on the line once again in february			0
but this time the club 's doubts over @entity4 were laid bare for all to see following @entity46 's now infamous @entity143 interview where he admitted a plan was already in place should the club decide to sack their manager			1
out of his depth ? @entity13 was handed an unenviable task of taking over from @entity4 last month another win , this time over @entity151 yet again saved @entity4 's job - but just one win in the next six games was enough for @entity46 , as he finally wielded the axe			1
but the question is : why did it take a year for the club to bite the bullet and sack the former @entity160 boss ? the board were obviously unconvinced , as were supporters who gradually started to turn on @entity4			2
in confirming @entity4 's sacking in in april , @entity46 said : ' if we go down will i resign ? that would be a matter for me to discuss with the board			0
i 'm aware of my responsibilities			0
' indeed , you are partly responsible for taking @entity3 down .			0

@entity21 , @entity20 and @entity64 keen to leave @entity3
canaries are all but relegated from the @entity130
@entity4 was sacked by the club last month
@entity13 has n't been able to arrest the slide to the championship
