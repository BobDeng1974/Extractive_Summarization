in the final column of the season , the @entity0 hands out its annual awards for the good , the bad and the ridiculous ... best newcomer a difficult category with @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 all highly commended but it has to be @entity10			1
it was @entity12 who first enthusiastically advocated him but early evidence in @entity15 left the jury out			0
then @entity17 decided , surprisingly , that he should bat at three for the first test of the summer and the rest … an average of 60 after his first eight tests , the first five of them without a victory , with three hundreds and another three half centuries is bradmanesque and the biggest tribute you can pay to @entity30 is that @entity31 has not been missed			1
just has to make sure he leaves his shirt on when visiting @entity36 bars			0
fitting in seamlessly : @entity10 celebrates one of his three hundreds this summer , against @entity39 put your shirt on him : @entity30 has been superb at @entity42 - now he just has to watch himself in nightclubs best performer in a leading role no problem for the judges this time			1
what a season for a man who became man of the series against @entity39 despite not being at his very best and ending it in tears after just failing to hang on for a draw at @entity57			2
life was just as eventful for @entity49 against @entity59 , first when he batted for nearly four hours at @entity60 , clashed with @entity61 , wasted perfect conditions at @entity63 and then gloriously set new standards in the last three @entity22			1
he stands just three wickets away from sir @entity67 ’s test record and is a national treasure			1
master of his art : @entity49 set new standards with his seam bowling against @entity59 @entity72 and @entity49 thrilled with win most ill - advised judgment call @entity76 ’s obsession with getting @entity49 banned for whatever happened away from the public eye in the @entity60 pavilion			1
the @entity81 captain ’s arrogant assumption that he can do what he wants was embarrassingly rejected by judge @entity83 who threw out the serious @entity86 charge in just 10 minutes , with around £ 200,000 wasted on lawyers			0
think what good that could have done in grass - roots cricket			2
meanwhile , @entity59 seemed to lose all focus while concentrating on @entity76 ’s righteous indignation and were a rabble by @entity93			1
most ill - judged on - field incident has to be the ‘ @entity95 ’ of @entity8 by @entity96 at @entity97 in an attempt to avenge what @entity39 saw as an @entity101 conspiracy to report his bowling action			1
forget all this business about it being in the rules			0
it was a crass piece of cricket which spoilt the otherwise highly impressive impression that @entity110 made as a young and ultimately triumphant captain			0
@entity110 , who led his side to victory in all three formats , was definitely both the overseas player and captain of the season			0
ill - judged : @entity96 ' @entity117 ' @entity8 , which sparked a row between @entity119 and @entity39 hidden gem of the season of the many huge decisions that @entity123 had to make in his first couple of months as managing director one of the best and least heralded was persuading @entity126 to swap the head coach ’s job with @entity39 to become @entity17 ' assistant in a new coaching line - up			1
the former @entity132 director of cricket is the perfect foil for @entity17 and has quickly become a significant figure in the @entity119 set - up			1
has a great perspective on the ups and downs of cricketing life , too , after being caught up in the terrorist attack on the @entity143 team in @entity144 five years ago			0
went to meet him in a @entity149 school in may and was immediately impressed by his character			0
in desperate times in the @entity154 , @entity152 can be such a positive role model for @entity155 in this country as well as an inspiration for all @entity158			1
he does not push his religion down anyone ’s throats either , as some have suggested , but he is very much a proud , modern @entity163			0
he can bat and bowl , too			0
modern @entity163 : @entity7 is a positive role model for @entity158 ... and a good all - rounder , too most significant innings @entity8 ’s incredible 121 off 74 balls in a losing cause against @entity39 at @entity63 was a game changer in so many ways			1
before then @entity172 was in line to keep wicket in this season ’s @entity22 should @entity176 not recover full fitness			0
@entity119 understandably gave prior another chance as part of their senior spine but he was never fully fit and the introduction of @entity8 to @entity22 at @entity182 was a highly significant moment			2
he has proved since he can build an innings as well as explode out of the blocks while , with the exception of @entity188 , his keeping has been outstanding			0
he really can become @entity119 ’s answer to @entity190			2
game changer : @entity8 's explosive odi innings at @entity63 paved the way for his test debut prospective most exciting newcomer @entity196 has the potential to do for @entity119 what @entity198 did for @entity15 , progress from a @entity202 specialist all the way to dynamic test opener			1
but first he will have to prove he can do it in 50 - over cricket against @entity59 , @entity39 and then the @entity207			1
five centuries for @entity209 in all competitions this season show @entity196 is ready for promotion and he seems to have matured as a character which was necessary when a lack of self - discipline threatened to stall his progress			2
most unlucky cricketer not to be called up has to be @entity196 ' @entity209 colleague @entity219			1
when he smashed an unbeaten hundred against @entity221 off 55 balls last week in front of not one selector but two in @entity226 and @entity227 his return to the one - day squad seemed assured			0
but no. there appears to be a theory that he only produces the goods in tv matches			0
well , all international games are on the telly			0
highly commended in this category is @entity238 – still astonished that he has lost his one - day place			0
contrasting fortunes : @entity196 ( left ) was finally being selected for @entity119 's 50 - over squad but his county colleague @entity219 ( right , celebrating a ton for the @entity244 ) was unlucky not to be called up most impressive county @entity246			1
they are setting the standards for everyone else to match , not just in leading the way in the county championship but the way they are developing so many players for the @entity119 team , including one in @entity256 who seemed to be going nowhere at @entity258			1
there are more to come too			0
@entity260 is high on @entity119 ’s agenda while @entity262 is back on their radar			2
a strong @entity246 makes for a strong @entity119 ? it is as true today as ever			2
the last laugh award few @entity119 captains have had to cope with as much opprobrium as @entity268 , not only from irrelevant nasty voices on @entity270 but also when as many as six former @entity119 captains said he should quit after the low point of @entity275 ’s defeat by @entity59			1
he may have considered packing it all in but he battled on , maintaining his dignity throughout , and what the bulk of @entity119 cricket followers rather than the loud mouthed minority thought of him became clear in the enthusiastic support he received from @entity22 crowds everywhere , particularly @entity182			2
needless to say , i had the last laugh : @entity268 was heavily criticised by most following the series defeat by @entity39 and a 10 - test winless run but ended up captaining @entity119 to a series victory over @entity59 the @entity119 team are in a position to grow now in a positive healthy environment created by @entity268 , @entity17 and @entity126			1
it had to be done after @entity15 and thankfully @entity268 is still at the helm to carry it through			2
@entity298 ’s final word the schedules facing @entity119 over the next 18 months are madness , as we have highlighted in these pages , and there was a strong case for @entity268 and @entity49 to be rested for the five - match one - day international series against @entity59			1
clearly , this is the start of the build - up to the @entity207 but the pair could have come back refreshed either in @entity39 in november or the new year in the triangular series against @entity15 and @entity59			1
they need to be looked after , as @entity310 must be when he returns after knee surgery			0
otherwise our best players will be finished by early 2016			0
the good - @entity119 eventually re-engaged with the public			1
it took a while but there was a massive response from the senior players while the many emerging younger ones delivered immediately			0
@entity268 won the day and proved emphatically that behind every good man is a woman – or a farmer ’s wife in @entity325 ’s case			2
sounds like the @entity327 should be in @entity328 ! the bad - the continued hike of test match prices which is the single most emotive topic on my @entity270 timeline			0
the bidding system to stage @entity22 is flawed and it is an absolute disgrace that there will be no @entity335 next summer in the north of @entity119			2
and a consequence of the system is that there seems to be a total disregard for the wishes of the @entity119 team when it comes to preparing @entity335 pitches			0
sort it out , @entity347 .			0

@entity30 is the best newcomer to the @entity119 side , averaging 60 at @entity42
@entity49 had a glorious summer and is now a national treasure
@entity76 's obsession with trying to get @entity49 banned cost @entity59
@entity39 's ' @entity95 ' of @entity8 was ill - advised
@entity126 has been the perfect foil for @entity17
@entity7 is a role model , an inspiration and a good all - rounder
@entity8 's odi innings at @entity63 changed the course of his summer
@entity196 can be explosive - but @entity219 is unlucky to miss out
@entity246 are setting the standards in county cricket
@entity268 kept his dignity under fire and now @entity119 can grow
