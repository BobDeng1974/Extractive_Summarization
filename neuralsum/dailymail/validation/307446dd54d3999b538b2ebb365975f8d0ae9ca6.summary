a niece of one of the victims of the @entity4 crash is haunted by the ' atrocious ' thought that her uncle spent the last eight minutes of his life knowing he was going to die			1
@entity7 , niece of 59 - year - old @entity9 father and grandfather @entity8 , said that the thought was ' very hard '			1
' my uncle certainly knew that he was living his last moments and it 's very hard to hear that the descent of the aircraft lasted eight minute , ' she told @entity19 newspaper			1
he was killed when the @entity23 crashed in the @entity24 on tuesday happy : although @entity8 ' niece said she was haunted by the idea that he knew he was going to die for eight minutes while the plane was descending , an aviation expert has said that it is more likely that the passengers and crew were calm and did not realise that they were in mortal danger ' for eight long minutes , he was dying			1
this is atrocious ! i dare not imagine the horror of parents who tried to protect their babies in this airplane			2
' but a veteran @entity23 pilot has said that the passengers would have been unlikely to know that they were going to die			1
if anything , he said , the plane would have been filled with ' eerie silence '			1
' it is likely that there was a problem with the pilots , as they put the plane into descent but failed to control it , ' said @entity51 , who is also an examiner for @entity53 's @entity52			1
' the aircraft descended at fairly normal rate , in a fairly normal way			0
it was steep , but i have used steeper descents on a regular basis			0
it was well within the everyday operation and not in any way terrifying			0
' it is likely the oxygen masks were released , he said , and if passengers did not put them on quickly enough they may have lost consciousness			2
there also may have been ' unpleasant noises and wind effects ' , which may have caused some alarm			0
but the plane was not ' tumbling out of the sky in a screaming dive '			2
' the crew was probably sitting there waiting for the pilot to complete the descent , ' he said			0
' there was probably no indication to passengers of what the end was going to be			2
' there may have been some panic when they saw the mountains coming up through the windows , but it would have been brief			0
' either way , in my experience , passengers tend to stay absolutely silent during an emergency			2
' it 's not a @entity99 panic , it 's an eerie silence			1
' mr @entity8 , born in @entity101 , had returned to @entity9 in 1960 and lived in @entity102 and @entity103			1
after meeting his @entity106 born wife , @entity105 , the couple settled down in @entity107 , 25 km from @entity108			0
they had three sons aged 17 to 31 , and three grandchildren			0
' he was a wonderful man who loved his family above all , ' said ms @entity7			1
' for more than 30 years he travelled almost weekly in his job			0
but in this family we 're birds			0
drissens are globe - trotters who love to travel			0

@entity7 , niece of 59 - year - old @entity9 father and grandfather @entity121 , said the thought is ' very hard '

but a @entity53 aviation expert said it is unlikely passengers knew they were going to die
instead , he said , the plane would have been filled with ' eerie silence '
