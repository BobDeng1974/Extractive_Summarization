by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:03 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 9 june 2013 celebrity fan : model @entity3 wore the squeeze this t - shirt featuring a picture of @entity9 's bottom this week pop diva @entity9 could be heading for another legal showdown with @entity11 – after @entity12 discovered the high street chain has been selling a t - shirt featuring a photograph of her much - exposed backside			1
the singer is currently embroiled in a legal battle with sir @entity20 ’s company over another design that bears an unauthorised – and unflattering – image of her face			1
she is said to be seeking £ 3.5 million in that case , but is apparently either unaware or unconcerned that an image of her grabbing her own bottom has been emblazoned on to another t - shirt – along with the slogan : ‘ squeeze this ! ’ – which is available from the store			1
the picture was taken by photographer @entity34 while she was on stage in denim hot pants and fishnet tights at the @entity38 in @entity39 in 2011			1
it was printed on to t - shirts by the design label @entity43 and sold on the website of @entity11 ’s menswear section @entity46 for £ 28			2
however , it was removed from sale on thursday , hours after @entity12 asked the company about the design			2
the company then released a statement saying : ‘ we can confirm that the t - shirt in question is from a concession brand and is not a @entity46 t - shirt			2
’ intriguingly , @entity9 ’s friend @entity3 wore the shirt at @entity58 on tuesday night			1
the supermodel happily posed for cameras on the red carpet of the star - studded event wearing the design tucked into black pencil trousers , and even posted on @entity65 a picture of herself pretending to squeeze the bottom on the t - shirt			1
@entity9 , who has her own fashion line with @entity11 rivals @entity70 , has filed legal papers over the first t - shirt , describing it as a ‘ low - quality image and product that would not have been authorised ’			0
the 25 - year - old star is said to be annoyed that , legally , the photographer , rather than the subject of the image owns the rights to the shot			0
sir @entity20 is believed to have offered the singer £ 3,500 in compensation for using the image , but she refused			0
she is said to be determined to take the case through the courts on principle , and has already spent more than £ 600,000 of her own money on legal fees			0
legal battle : @entity9 is suing @entity11 for using her image on this t - shirt ( left )			2
it is not yet known how she will react to the news the store has been selling a shirt featuring a picture of her bottom ( right ) singer : @entity9 has been touring in @entity103 while the legal case against @entity11 continues a source told reporters : ‘ she believes they are taking advantage of artists , that it ’s just exploitation and what they are doing is wrong			1
’ @entity9 was once a close family friend of sir @entity20 and his daughter @entity113			0
she sang at sir @entity20 ’s 60th birthday in @entity115 last year and she spent @entity116 with the @entity20 family in 2010			0
however , in recent weeks , 22 - year - old @entity113 has been pictured cuddling up to @entity9 ’s ex-boyfriend @entity118 , which is said to have enraged the singer			0
@entity9 last month tweeted a racy close - up of her backside in very skimpy denim shorts in an apparent bid to make @entity118 jealous .			0

@entity102 is already suing clothing chain for selling top featuring her face
store has also been selling top with picture of her bottom on it
the new top was worn by @entity3 earlier this week
