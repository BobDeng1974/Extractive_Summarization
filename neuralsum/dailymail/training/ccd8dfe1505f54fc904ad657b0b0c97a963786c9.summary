by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 11 march 2013 a back garden inventor has published details on how an old - style big screen television can be converted into a solar - powered death ray that burns at @entity5			2
@entity6 , the self - styled king of @entity7 , has made two @entity9 videos which show how the screens of old rear - projection tvs can be used to condense sunlight into point capable of melting coins			1
the incredible films show him using such a screen mounted on to a wooden frame to burns holes through concrete , boil water in seconds and incinerate planks of wood			2
solar powered death ray : this image shows how coins can easily be melted with a lens harvested from an old television and used to focus the @entity31 's rays hot : the beam of concentrated solar power is so strong it can not only boil water in seconds but also burn its way through the glass bottle in which the liquid is contained mr @entity6 scoured the ' free ' section of local classified ads to find an old rear - projection television with the right kind of screen to hack out for his project			1
prior to the roll out of large led and plasma displays , cathode ray tube rear - projection tvs were the first to exceed 40in screen size			1
they used three @entity52 - one red , one green and one blue - aligned so the colours mix correctly on to a screen incorporating a @entity55 - the same type of lens used in lighthouses			2
although they once commanded retail prices of many thousands of pounds , such ageing television sets are now easy to get hold of because they cost more to fix than they can be sold for			0
hack job : @entity6 harvested the lens from an old - style rear - projection television set ... ... and mounted it in this homemade frame having got hold of such a television , mr @entity6 dismantled the set to separate the four foot - wide acrylic lens , then mounted it into a wooden frame built for the purpose			1
' these lenses are found in " rear - projection " televisions and not all are the same , ' mr @entity6 said			1
' some are discolored , and some concentrate to a beam rather than a point			0
' the particular screen i found was a crystal clear acrylic lens that focused to a point			0
' it may have been luck that i found it on my first try , because 3 tv 's after that all had lesser grade lenses , but still produced enough heat to melt zinc			0
' in his @entity9 films , mr @entity6 shows how the lens is powerful to melt or burn a range of different objects , including @entity101 pennies , glass beer bottles and even concrete			1
sounding a note of caution , he added : ' this project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training			0
misuse , or careless use , of tools or projects may result in serious injury or death			0
' @entity114 generated from a @entity55 can exceed @entity115 and cause serious damage to persons or property			0

inventor publishes @entity9 videos showing how to build the *contraption*
it uses a lens from a rear - projection tv to harvest the power of the @entity31
using it he is able to burn through coins , bottles and wood in seconds
