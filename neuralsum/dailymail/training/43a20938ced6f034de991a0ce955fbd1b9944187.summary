@entity2 's key @entity1 qualifying tie against @entity3 descended into farce last night as heavy rain left the pitch unplayable - after officials ignored the weather forecasts and refused to close the stadium 's retractable roof			1
thousands of fans who had travelled to eastern @entity12 for the game against @entity3 were left infuriated as officials stood and watched as a torrential downpour struck in @entity16			1
heavy rain had been falling in the @entity3 capital for most of the day but still the roof of the £ 400million state - of - the - art stadium stayed open and gradually the playing surface disappeared under pools of water			2
the match was eventually called off - but only after fans , and millions watching on television at home , were left waiting 45 minutes for the decision to be made			1
game over : @entity2 had been due to take on @entity3 in a @entity1 qualifier in @entity16 , but the match was called off due to a waterlogged pitch soggy : @entity2 's match in @entity3 was called off after heavy rain made the pitch unplayable open goal : heavy rain falls on the pitch , leaving some fans wondering why the stadium roof was not closed @entity40 referee @entity39 inspected the pitch at 8pm , when the match was due to start			1
there was little prospect of play , but football 's governing body @entity46 was so desperate for the game to go ahead that the final decision was not made until 8.45pm			1
@entity50 continued to fall and there was no chance of the match being played properly			1
it was the first time that an @entity2 match had been called off due to the weather since 1979			1
the @entity57 said the game would be played at 4pm on wednesday instead			1
the decision was greeted with derision by the fans who travelled to the game at @entity16 's @entity63			1
it also called into question the @entity3 authorities ' decision not to close the stadium roof during the downpour			2
officials are reported to have claimed that the roof could not be closed because the wind and rain was too intense			2
@entity74 , wet , wet : @entity2 goalkeeper @entity75 ( left ) and coach @entity76 ( right ) tried to carry on with their normal pre-match routines , but the rain made play impossible making a splash : @entity2 boss @entity76 tries to kick a football on the sodden pitch before the scheduled kick - off belting down : the massive downpour left standing water all across the pitch in @entity16 @entity2 coach @entity76 claimed the pitch would take plenty of work to be playable tomorrow			1
he said on @entity91 : ' i 'm rather hoping there 'll get it ( the roof ) closed now as quickly as possible and start to do some work on the pitch because at moment the pitch is in very poor condition			2
' water is lying on the surface			2
it 's going to need a lot of attention if it 's going to be playable tomorrow afternoon			2
' the @entity2 boss said he was happy with the rescheduled time			1
' i think it was the only decision that could be made , ' he said			0
' there 're no other possibilities			0
you ca n't find dates at international level			0
' the dates that are available are all taken up so you ca n't just suddenly decide we 'll play it another time			0
' damp squib : @entity2 fans were given little information as to what was going on as the rain fell joker : a @entity3 fan manages to see the funny side after getting on to the waterlogged pitch dive : another @entity3 supporter slides on the waterlogged pitch			1
the conditions meant the match was unable to go ahead giving him the slip : a @entity3 fan evades a steward as supporters took to amusing themselves ' what you have to do is to try to organise to get the game played as quickly as possible			1
we 'll have to go back to the hotel			0
' we prepared well for this start tonight as no doubt the @entity3 have too , but now we 've got to do it all over again and hopefully we 'll be as prepared tomorrow as we were tonight			0
' @entity2 fans booked on to flights home were understandably angry because most of them will now miss the match			1
a lack of communication added to their annoyance as news finally filtered through that the game had been postponed for 20 hours because of a severely waterlogged pitch			2
former @entity2 manager @entity152 , in @entity16 working for the @entity153 , said : ' this is @entity154			1
both sets of supporters are being treated disgracefully			0
if i was a fan i ’d be booing			0
' i thought this was a prime example of how supporters are treated with such disrespect			0
' what i mean by that is that it was pretty obvious from the moment the ref came on the pitch for the very first time that this pitch was not playable			0
' you could see that , yet it was two and a quarter hours later before supporters were actually told it was n't on			0
the 2,000 travelling @entity2 fans were also left disappointed that @entity76 and his players did not come out to see them in @entity16			1
failing to acknowledge supporters is one of the details contained in @entity2 's new code of conduct but the players were changed and on their bus by the time the game was called off			1
supporters were left to find out details about the game via friends at home watching on television			1
@entity189 and @entity190 , both in the @entity191 and based at @entity192 in @entity193 , are just back from @entity194			0
mr @entity189 said : ' the @entity57 advised fans to pack for rain on our fans ' website so no - one can say that they were n't expecting rain			1
' we had to take two different flights			0
we 're working - class lads , this is a treat for us			0
' mr @entity190 said : ' what disappointed me most was the players could not be bothered to come out and see the fans			2
' own goal : the rain had begun to gather in pools on the pitch from the afternoon - yet officials did nothing water wings : the area in front of the dugouts was covered with pools of rainwater @entity222 travelled from @entity223 with his father , also @entity222 , and @entity225 , flying from @entity226 to @entity227 and then more than six hours on a minibus by road to @entity16			0
' the fact that we were getting our information from friends at home was a disgrace , ' said @entity236			0
' there was only one announcement in @entity239 all night			0
' why did n't they shut the roof ? we knew it would rain			0
' the @entity57 's @entity243 said compensation is ' something we are looking into , but i ca n't give any final decision on that '			1
according to @entity3 journalists , home manager @entity249 had asked for the roof to be left open on monday because he thought the forecast rain would be a leveller against @entity2			1
unfortunately the rain was much heavier than expected , leaving @entity2 without the majority of their travelling fans and @entity259 clubs furious that their players will return from international duty a day late			1
the problems were partly caused by the elaborate but severely flawed design of the stadium , and the fact that the roof can not be closed when it is raining			0
in the dry it takes just 15 minutes			0
when asked why the roof was n’t used , @entity76 said : ‘ i ca n’t answer that			0
it was pretty obvious early on that the game was not going to be played			2
for the @entity3 federation , it ’s a disaster			0
they had a big crowd so there ’s a problem in rearranging tickets for a match tomorrow			2
’ desperate measures : stadium workers tried to clear the pitch of water , but their efforts did not stop the referee calling the game off miserable : @entity40 referee @entity39 ( right ) kicks a football as he inspects the pitch what they should have done : the @entity63 in @entity16 , @entity3 - with the roof closed			2

millions of @entity294 had been due to watch the game on television
first @entity2 match to be called off due to weather since 1979
match will go ahead at 4pm on wednesday weather *permitting* , @entity57 confirms
the @entity57 ' is looking into compensating fans '
