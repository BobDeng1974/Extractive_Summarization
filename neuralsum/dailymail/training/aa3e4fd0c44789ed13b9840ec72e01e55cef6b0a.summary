@entity0 , a 46 - year - old clerical assistant from @entity1 , has n’t been able to kiss her children for over five years			1
a constant burning pain in her chin and the right side of her face means the devoted mother has had to avoid any kind of close physical contact with her loved ones			2
what compounds @entity0 ’s distress is that it was a routine operation to extract a wisdom tooth that left her in this state			1
@entity0 , 46 , from @entity1 , was left with permanent nerve damage after several operations on her wisdom teeth that left her in agony for six years			1
she has since received compensation from @entity21 during the procedure six years ago , the dentist damaged the inferior dental nerve , which provides sensation to the lip and chin			2
‘ it has been an absolutely horrendous time , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i ’m in pain all the time			2
i find eating really difficult and the worst thing is that i ca n’t bear contact anywhere near my face including hugging and kissing			2
’ that means her daughter @entity34 , 27 , son @entity35 , 24 , and her partner , @entity36 , ca n’t go near her			2
she says : ‘ i ’ve been on ever - increasing doses of painkillers and none has worked			0
the only way i get any temporary relief is with a pain patch on my chin			2
’ this contains drugs that seep into the skin and block pain			2
‘ but it has to stay on at least 12 hours a day to have any effect			0
’ the problem is that wisdom teeth can lie very close to the inferior dental nerve , explains @entity53 , professor of medicine in dentistry at the @entity56			1
he says damage can be avoided if ‘ a decent enough x-ray is given before the procedure goes ahead ’			2
he points out : ‘ it ’s not enough for a dentist to give an internal x-ray in the mouth as that only shows a small area — it needs to be a good panoramic one			0
even then , if the dentist is even slightly unsure of where this nerve lies , they need to refer the patient to a specialised dental surgeon who should take a ct scan before going ahead			2
’ wisdom teeth , found at the back of the mouth , are the last four teeth to come through — usually in our late teens or early 20s			1
there is n’t always room for them to grow , so they can emerge at an angle or only partially break through - when they are described as ‘ impacted ’			0
food and bacteria can become trapped around the tooth , causing a build - up of plaque , and decay and infection			2
problems can occur years after the teeth have erupted			2
wisdom teeth extraction is one of the most common procedures carried out in the @entity98			1
in @entity99 alone , 63,000 are extracted each year in @entity101 hospitals wisdom tooth extraction is one of the most common procedures carried out in the @entity98 - in @entity99 alone , 63,000 are extracted each year in @entity101 hospitals			1
yet it is a potentially complex operation , carrying the risk of nerve damage , infection and bleeding			1
under guidelines from the @entity116 , ‘ only patients who have diseased wisdom teeth , or other problems with their mouth , should have their wisdom teeth removed ’			1
dentists do n’t need specialist training to perform an extraction but some prefer to refer patients to a specialist oral or dental surgeon			2
@entity0 ’s problems began after she suffered several minor infections in her lower right jaw over a two - and - a - half year period			1
her dentist suggested a wisdom tooth was the cause and referred her to a hospital dental surgeon in october 2008			1
an x-ray confirmed the problem and the following month the tooth was removed			1
but almost immediately afterwards , it was clear something was very wrong			0
‘ for three days my face was a balloon , and i had this terrible pressure , ’ @entity0 recalls			1
while the swelling subsided , ‘ as the days went by i felt this throbbing pain building in my face and chin ’			2
despite repeated visits to the hospital over the next few months , @entity0 was told her symptoms were normal — and was given increasing doses of pain relief			1
‘ it was getting impossible to do anything normal and i begged for help			0
i could even feel pain if i brushed cotton wool against my face			2
yet all the time i was told things would be fine			0
’ finally , in may 2009 , she had surgery for what she was told was a damaged nerve			2
it left her in agony for three weeks , with a bruised and battered - looking face			0
‘ it was the most awful time , i could n’t work and lived on painkillers , ’ she says			0
then in may 2010 , nearly 18 months after the extraction , @entity0 had an operation to remove scar tissue , which was thought to be compounding the pain			1
but this made no difference , and she was told the nerve damage was permanent			1
@entity0 , pictured here , has received £ 15,000 from @entity21 but she says she would give it all back to be rid of the pain she still suffers ‘ i was devastated			1
i just could n’t believe all this was happening to me , ’ she says			0
she went back to her dentist , who referred her to a different @entity101 surgeon — he said she should have had a ct scan at the start ; this would have revealed how close the teeth were to the nerve , and a different procedure could have been offered			1
it ’s a depressingly familiar scenario , says @entity182 , a consultant oral surgeon at @entity183 and the @entity184			0
‘ if the nerve is too close then the patient should have a coronectomy — where we remove the crown , but leave the root , preventing damage to associated nerves			1
’ there is also a question of whether extraction is advisable , especially as we age			0
as dr @entity201 , of @entity202 in @entity203 , says : ‘ if a patient has them taken out in their late teens then the jawbones are still quite flexible , which makes extraction easier			0
' but by their 30s or 40s , the jawbone has matured so it ’s a lot more difficult			0
’ @entity207 found this out in january , when her dentist yanked out her wisdom tooth			1
the mother - of - three from @entity211 , @entity212 , had been told she needed the procedure because her wisdom tooth was impacted , and had probably caused a couple of minor infections			1
‘ i was given a local anaesthetic , but the dentist just could n’t seem to get the tooth out			0
he was pulling and tugging and i could feel the most intense pressure			0
‘ in the end he had to chisel into the bone			0
my head felt like it was going to explode and the nurse had to hold me still			0
’ once the tooth was out , over the next few days @entity207 , 40 , was in so much pain she ended up in @entity226			1
she was diagnosed with dry socket , where a blood clot fails to develop in the tooth socket — which affects 5 to 10 per cent of patients			0
this exposes the nerve , causing unbearable pain			1
‘ there was nothing that could be done other than let the tissue heal over the nerve , ’ recalls @entity207			0
‘ i lived on painkillers for three months			0
' my children are only one , four and seven and it was so hard to do anything			0
i could n’t sleep because of the pain			0
‘ yet no one told me it could be like this , or set out the pros and cons before the procedure			0
i ’d been made to feel wisdom teeth were a breeze			1
’ it ’s important to make sure you need the operation , stresses mr @entity182			0
‘ with problems such as repeated infections , it may well be that removing them is necessary			0
wisdom teeth , found at the back of the mouth , are the last four teeth to come through ¿ usually in our late teens or early 20s			1
there is n't always room for them to grow , so they can emerge at an angle or only partially break through - when they are described as ' impacted ' ' however , sometimes they are blamed unnecessarily when the teeth start to overlap at the front			1
some dentists believe it ’s because they ’re being pushed by wisdom teeth — even if the teeth are deeply buried and there ’s no sign of decay			1
it ’s far more likely that this overlapping is caused by “ anterior drift ” , a movement of the teeth which is simply part of the ageing process			0
’ mr @entity182 also says you need to ask how many of these extractions your dentist does a month			0
‘ i do ten a week and have done for 20 years			0
it needs to be done by someone with experience			0
and do n’t be afraid to ask the dentist how long they take — even a complex tooth should n’t take more than 20 minutes — and how near to the nerve the wisdom tooth lies			1
’ @entity0 has since has received £ 15,000 from @entity21 after the @entity297 negotiated an out - of - court settlement			1
yet she says she would give it all back to be rid of the pain she still suffers			0
‘ i just wish i ’d never had my wisdom teeth out			1
whatever they were trying to resolve is nothing like the complications i have now			0

without proper scans of teeth , there is a danger of permanent nerve damage
@entity0 , 46 , from @entity1 , ca n't even kiss her children
her wisdom tooth was removed in 2008 but several operations could n't stop the pain
