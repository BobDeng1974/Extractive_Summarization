once , he was the epitome of decadence			1
a mischievous charmer i last saw resplendent in a maroon crushed - velvet smoking jacket and @entity6 slippers			1
now , the self - styled ‘ lord ’ @entity7 sits on the ‘ wrong ’ side of the table in a prison visiting hall , a uniformed guard behind him			1
@entity7 ’s perma - tan has faded to a pallid grey			1
his hair and figure are thinner , the dancing blue eyes are now rheumy and bloodshot			1
the socialite charm has been replaced by wariness – his gaze darts around the room to point out murderers , armed robbers and rapists			1
his only thought is to survive one of @entity29 ’s toughest jails unscathed			2
' @entity30 ' : @entity7 pictured with his @entity32 girlfriend @entity31 - @entity33 the man who was one of @entity36 ’s most colourful men - about - town is now known simply as @entity40 prisoner number @entity38			1
twelve months into an eight - year sentence for his part in a multi-million - pound fraud , 46 - year - old @entity7 says he deeply regrets causing so much pain to his mother and his girlfriend			1
but there appears to be little remorse for those who lost their homes and livelihoods			2
in an exclusive interview inside the prison , @entity7 accepts what he did was wrong but tells me he is planning an appeal against his conviction – and claims he is a poor businessman rather than a crook			1
those he stole from might think of him less charitably			2
‘ yes , i did receive £ 773,000 as the courts say and i accept what i did was wrong , ’ he says			2
‘ but it is such a waste of time and public money for me to be in here			2
it would have been far more beneficial for all concerned if i had been made to repay the money			2
’ for two decades , @entity7 – the ‘ lord ’ refers to a manorial title he bought – was a central figure in @entity36 ’s most hedonistic circles			1
in the @entity72 , his black - tie ‘ @entity71 ’ became notorious for the drunken debauchery of public school - educated teens before they were brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of tax fraud			1
undeterred by spending nine days in @entity78 before his sentence was suspended , @entity7 bought the @entity80 in @entity81 in 1999 for £ 50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war			1
today , it is said to be worth £ 30 million			2
@entity7 bought the @entity80 in 1999 for £ 50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war the magnificent historic house is familiar to millions as the set of the @entity90 - winning film @entity89			1
@entity7 ’s parties there proved hugely successful			1
the most notorious events were sex parties where @entity95 and condoms were freely available			2
he admits he regularly participated in orgies			2
‘ @entity30 ’ was soon a fixture in gossip columns , with homes in @entity36 and @entity101 , a wardrobe full of @entity104 suits , a fleet of exotic cars , and a host of celebrity acquaintances			2
but his glamorous lifestyle disintegrated when he was accused of fleecing businessmen crippled by the credit crunch			2
@entity7 and his co-defendants , @entity113 and @entity114 , were last year convicted of advance - fee fraud at @entity116			1
the men formed a company , @entity118 ( whose name bore a remarkable resemblance to an unconnected @entity122 firm of 50 years standing ) and offered loans to companies desperate for finance			2
more than 100 clients were asked to pay non-returnable ‘ due diligence fees ’ for loans that never materialised			2
altogether , @entity118 charged fees of more than £ 4 million – of which @entity7 personally received £ 773,000			1
the judge claimed @entity7 was the ‘ ringmaster ’ who was careful not to leave ‘ footprints in the snow ’			1
@entity7 , meanwhile , continues to stretch credulity by claiming he was a dupe who was unaware of the bigger deals his partners were negotiating abroad			1
‘ i ’m keeping my head down pending my appeal , ’ he said			1
‘ prison can be a dangerous place			2
i want to just get on with it , though having been institutionalised in boarding school helps			2
’ he has witnessed a fellow prisoner running around naked covered in blue paint , and another attempting suicide by slashing his wrists			2
he says : ‘ i was thrown in the deep end from the start when i had to share a cell with a heroin addict			0
he managed to get hold of drugs in prison and he kept trying to pick a fight with me			0
’ his cellmate ’s possession of drugs cost him his prison privileges			0
@entity7 says : ‘ i had to give back my laptop			1
but the worst thing was that when my mother came to visit , i had to talk with her from behind glass			0
i could see she was upset			0
’ he smiles admiringly as he recalls the way @entity167 , 78 , coped with the indignity of a body search			0
‘ she shouted , “ do you really think a woman like me is smuggling drugs in here ? ” ’ another regular visitor is @entity7 ’s @entity32 girlfriend of eight years , nightclub promoter @entity175 , 28			1
‘ he is putting a brave face on it , ’ she says			0
‘ sometimes he gets a bit jealous because he knows i ’m having a good time outside			0
whether we get married , i do n’t know			0
like @entity30 , i take each day as it comes			0
nothing has changed the way i feel about him			0
’ jail time : @entity7 has swapped his @entity81 mansion for the confines of @entity187 as a low - risk , category - c prisoner , @entity7 is able to wear his own clothes – a @entity192 ensemble of @entity194 shirt , @entity196 jeans and @entity6 loafers – under prison outerwear , today a luminous overall			1
and his good behaviour means he now has his own cell with a television ( his favourite shows are made in @entity204 and the new @entity205 ) , a lavatory and a supply of tinned groceries			0
‘ one thing about being in here is that i ’ve realised how lucky i am , ’ he says			0
‘ i was loved and well brought - up			1
’ ' i was thrown in at the deep end from the start when i had to share a cell with a heroin addict ' however , the root of his craving for company and attention may stem from his comfortable upbringing in @entity36			0
an only child , @entity7 ’s late father , @entity221 , was a restaurateur who ran a fashionable @entity204 bistro in the @entity223			1
‘ i was left to my own devices a lot as my parents always seemed to be working			0
’ he was sent to fee - paying @entity227 in @entity228 , chosen because it had a lively drama department			1
‘ my dream then was to be an actor , but i realised i was n’t any good			0
i under - achieved because i was dyslexic			1
maybe that ’s why i always want to prove myself			0
’ he left school with a single o - level in law			1
he knew from his experience as a boarder that privately educated teenagers were desperate to meet the opposite sex			0
his riotous @entity240 became an overnight sensation , making him a millionaire before the taxman caught up with him			0
yet by far @entity7 ’s biggest coup was buying the 24 - bedroom @entity81 property , complete with billiard room , ballroom and @entity248			1
he put the house to lucrative work as a set for fashion and film shoots and , unrelated to his sex parties , it was the venue for glitzy events attended by @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259			0
lucrative : @entity7 's riotous @entity240 became an overnight sensation and made him a millionaire @entity7 has never been able to resist a get - rich - quick scheme , a weakness that has twice put him behind bars			1
‘ i can assure you that being locked up is no holiday camp , it ’s hell , ’ he says			0
‘ the prison is often short - staffed , which means we can be banged up in our cells for long stretches			1
’ he is studying information technology and @entity274			0
‘ i like to think it makes me a better person			0
when i get out of here , i will be a more responsible businessman			0
‘ i have n’t given up yet			0
i am banned from being a company director for ten years , but i will start all over again somehow , probably by organising parties			0
‘ i miss the fun			0
not being able to be with a woman is also hard – all the guys feel it			0
they all want to know about the orgies			0
they were classy and sensual , with masks , candles , velvet cushions			0
outside , i mixed with everybody from @entity290 to @entity291 of @entity101 , in here i ’m just one of the lads			0
@entity295 ’s next challenge is his appeal next month			1
‘ i am mentally prepared to pay up , ’ he says			0
‘ my appeal gives me hope that there may be light at the end of the tunnel			1
that and the dream that one day i will be back in @entity81 having fabulous parties			0
