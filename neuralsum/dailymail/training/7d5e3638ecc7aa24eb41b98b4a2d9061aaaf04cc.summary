by @entity0 published : 15:21 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 16:20 est , 18 october 2013 when 22 - year - old @entity3 was found hanging from a dog leash in her @entity6 hotel room on @entity7 , @entity2 police ruled it a suicide			1
but that 's something @entity10 's mother @entity10 could never accept			1
in the five years since her daughter 's death , @entity10 has been relentless in championing her daughter 's case - insisting that investigators take a look at evidence that could lead to charges against @entity10 's then 48 - year - old boyfriend @entity19			1
with officials close to making a decision on whether to classify @entity10 's death as a homicide , her mother 's fight will be featured tonight in an hour - long episode of @entity27 's 20/20			1
mystery : 22 - year - old @entity3 ( above ) was discovered hanging in her hotel room on @entity7 2009 , but her mother has been fighting for the last five years to get her case reclassified as a homicide searching for the truth : @entity34 's mother @entity10 ( pictured left with her daughter ) has always believed that her daughter 's then 48 - year - old boyfriend @entity19 ( right ) had something to do with her death in the special , ms @entity10 explains all of the different factors that led her to believe her daughter did n't commit suicide			1
shortly before her death , @entity10 renewed a magazine subscription , wrote a rent check and renewed her aaa membership for the year			2
@entity10 was in @entity2 to spend @entity45 with her fiance , @entity19			2
that night they went to dinner at a restaurant across the street and then returned to their room at the @entity53 on @entity54			0
ringing in the @entity45 : @entity10 and her boyfriend had dinner on @entity45 before returning to their room at the @entity53 on @entity54 where neighbors later reported hearing them fighting love / hate : a friend described both @entity10 and @entity19 as stubborn , and said they would often butt heads then after midnight , guests in an adjacent room called 911 after hearing a fight in the couple 's suite			1
' she was n't the type of person to back down , ' friend @entity69 said			0
' he clearly was n't the type of person to back down , so they butt heads more often than not			0
' when police arrived , they passed @entity19 on his way out			2
@entity10 was in the room with her two dogs but did n't give any details about the fight			0
according to the account on the family 's website , @entity85 , @entity10 called the police department close to her home in @entity88 at 2am because she wanted officers to check it over			2
in a taped recording , the young woman 's voice can he heard saying he was ' going to ruin her apartment because she ruined his life '			0
the @entity97 site also has pictures she took on @entity7 after their fight , recording her injuries			0
evidence : pictures posted on the @entity97 page show images of her injuries she documented after their @entity7 2009 fight the next day ms @entity10 got a call from @entity19 who told her about the fight and how he was having a hard time reaching her			1
some 13 hours after @entity10 's 911 call , police entered the hotel room and found her hanging from one of her dog 's leashes in the bathroom			1
' getting a notification like that is ... physically and mentally , the worst , most horrifying event you could have in your life , ' ms @entity10 said about learning of her daughter 's death			1
from the beginning ms @entity10 suspected that @entity19 had something to do with @entity10 's death because he lied to her the fist time they met			1
when he introduced himself , he said he was 35 when he was really 42			0
seeds of distrust : when @entity10 first introduced her 42 - year - old boyfriend to her mother , @entity19 lied and said he was 35 three days after @entity10 's death , ms @entity10 met with @entity133 alone in her garage and warned him that she would find out the truth			1
' this is n't over , ' she said			0
' @entity10 did n't commit suicide			2
you can make this as easy or as hard on me , and yourself , as you would like			0
' ms @entity10 has kept true to that promise			2
over the last five years she has put her real estate career on the back burner while focusing all of her spare time on @entity10 ' case - collecting police reports , 911 call transcripts , autopsy reports and crime scene photos			1
how did she get there ? one crime expert noted that there was sand caked on @entity10 's feet at the scene , but no traces of the sand anywhere on the ground in the bathroom or just outside the bathroom she 's also studied other suicides , looking for patterns such as the presence of drugs and alcohol in the system			1
@entity10 tested below the legal limit for alcohol			0
there 's one thing that really stands our to her about the picture of @entity10 taken at the crime scene			2
' @entity10 , we wore the same mascara			0
i knew that ... if you cry with this mascara on , that mascara just clumps up , your eyelashes are all clumped up and ... hers were perfect			0
' crime experts have spotted some other holes in the case			0
veteran crime reporter @entity181 pointed out that there 's sand caked on @entity10 's feet but no traces of sand in the shower , on the bathroom floor or on the floor outside the bathroom			2
holes in his story : @entity19 claimed to return to his apartment in @entity194 after the fight , but his toll pass has no record of being charged for a return trip ' @entity199 was carried in there , postmortem and hung , or she somehow levitated into that room , ' mr @entity181 said			0
and then there 's the case of @entity133 who apparently returned to his apartment in @entity194 that night			0
he gave investigators his toll pass but there was never any record of it being charged on the return trip - leading ms @entity10 to believe he never left			2
initially @entity19 was n't named as a person of interest because @entity216 , a tenant at his apartment , had seen him returning home that night			0
' i have people that saw me that night , ' @entity19 said			0
' what would be my motive ? ' ' i 'm being victimized because i cared for someone , ' he added			0
history repeating ? a photo posted in june 2011 no the @entity97 page shows @entity19 in another hotel , with a new woman but in april 2012 mr @entity216 revised his statement , saying he could n't be sure when he saw @entity19 coming home because he had been drinking on @entity45			0
lately , ms @entity10 's hard work is finally starting to pay off			1
after asking three independent forensics experts to review her daughter 's case , they all agreed that it was not a suicide			1
she brought those three affidavits to the medical examiner who reclassified the death as ' undetermined pending further investigation '			1
justice : recently , ms @entity10 's hard work has paid off and she got the medical examiner to reclassify her daughter 's death from suicide to ' undetermined pending further investigation ' a year ago , the @entity249 decided that the case should be reopened			1
the case into @entity10 ' death is ongoing but a decision is expected soon from the @entity2 police on whether to keep the suicide ruling , or reclassify the death as homicide and press charges against a suspect the 20/20 story on @entity10 airs tonight at 10pm .			1

@entity3 , 22 , was discovered hanging in her hotel bathroom on @entity7 2009
initially her death was reported a suicide , but her mother @entity10 always believed it was a homicide
ms @entity10 has worked hard for the last five years to find the real truth behind her daughter 's death
she believes that her daughter 's fiance @entity19 is *responsible*
last year she *convinced* the @entity249 to reopen the case
after *enlisting* three independent forensics experts to review the case , their affidavits caused the medical examiner to reclassify @entity10 's death from suicide to ' undetermined pending further investigation '
a decision from police officials on whether to reclassify @entity10 's case as a homicide and press charges on a suspect is expected soon
