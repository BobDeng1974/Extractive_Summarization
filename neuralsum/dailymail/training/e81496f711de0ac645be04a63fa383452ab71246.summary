police have found no human remains in a suburban garden where it was claimed a war veteran was involved in the killing of a woman more than 50 years ago			1
forensic teams descended on the former home of @entity10 @entity9 navigator @entity8 yesterday after one of his nine children claimed a woman called @entity15 had been buried there in the late 1950s			1
but relatives of mr @entity8 insisted yesterday that the tip - off was a mistake and that police were wasting their time			1
this morning police confirmed no human remains had been found and said they believed the information was genuine			2
' i would very much like to thank the local residents from @entity35 and the surrounding area , for their co-operation and patience while we carried out this essential investigative work			0
' mr @entity8 , who worked as a bus driver after the war , lived in the semi-detached house in @entity47 , @entity32 , until he died aged 60 in 1981			0
the house has changed hands several times since			0
moved out : the family currently living at the property had to abandon their home during the search which ended today one of mr @entity8 ’s children , @entity57 , 58 , told the @entity58 last night that her sister @entity59 , 66 , went to the police claiming that her father and a group of friends had been involved in the death of a young woman named only as @entity15			1
but mrs @entity57 and another sibling insisted their sister was mistaken			0
mrs @entity57 , of @entity69 , @entity32 , said : ‘ my dad was quite a soft man			0
i can only remember him smacking me once			0
’ her brother @entity71 , 50 , who lives opposite the house that was searched , said yesterday : ‘ the police are wasting their time			1
’ the force would not reveal how much the operation cost but said costs were kept to a minimum			0
a spokesman said the investigation had now been closed added : ' the information we received was credible and corroborated by a number of people and we had a very specific location			0
' before the search was concluded a @entity32 source said : ‘ clearly we would not take such a drastic step as this type of search unless we believed the information was credible			0
’ the family currently living at the house have had to abandon their home for the duration of the search			1
major investigation : the current residents have no connection to the investigation and are not suspects police yesterday stressed the current residents have no connection to the investigation and are not suspected of committing any crime as the property has changed hands several times since the 1950s			1
officers were in the adjoining house 's garden as they hunted for the body			0
detectives were secretive about the source of the tip - off but a spokesman for @entity32 confirmed it does not relate to any other past or current cases			1
however , paperwork dating back to the period when the woman died was said to be well below today 's high standards making work difficult for anyone trying to trace missing person records			2
the excavation work follows a tip - off suggesting a body has been buried at the three - bedroom , semi-detached home on this quiet suburban street since the 1950s two large white tents filled the triangular garden of the house where police believed the human remains had sat below the soil for around 60 years			1
inside a forensic science team spent the day carrying out careful excavation - work , digging through the soil looking for bones			1
officers in white overalls , lilac gloves and hairnets worked busily in an area up several wooden stairs at the end of the garden , behind a brick , tiled - roof shed			2
however , the white and blue tarpaulin , pulled tight around the grassy area , hid their painstaking work from neighbours in the surrounding tree - lined gardens			2
@entity158 removed from the yard was packed into black dustbins stored alongside the two tents , during the meticulously - planned operation			2
eighteen police vehicles were also parked outside and uniformed officers kept a constant presence in the suburban street			2
a mobile police station parked further down the hill was set up to allow anyone with information access to officers .			0
