forget everything you 've ever heard about @entity3 's housing market , because the bubble surrounding the nation 's greatest property myths is about to be burst			1
national real estate analysts @entity8 have broken down the 20 greatest myths you 're ever likely to hear from real estate agents , developers and other property gurus spinning tales about panic in @entity3 's residential market			1
from ' the shortage bandwagon ' to inflated statistics about increased house prices across the country , @entity18 managing director @entity17 dispels it all			1
' he said research or evidence suggesting the shortage theory has never be proven , but it is nevertheless accepted by most people as accurate			0
' the shortage myth has been generated by organisations which represent developers and builders , ' he writes			0
' they 've achieved this by pumping out a stream of press releases over many years , each of them blaming all the problems in the residential market on a shortage of houses			1
' he draws on research from the @entity27 to refute suggestions that @entity3 has had a nationwide increase of 10 per cent over the last year			1
' but @entity3 house prices have not risen 10 %			1
' he said growth of that magnitude has occurred only in one city , @entity65			1
@entity65 house prices have increased 16 - 17 per cent in the pas 12 months far and away more than other capital city but despite the boom , @entity65 is not in the grip of a housing bubble according to mr @entity17 @entity32 is not the best time to buy and sell : this home will go to auction on november 6 in the season most auctions there is no shortage of land to build : ' there are many dozens of options ' mr @entity17 said prices on average have increased 16 - 17 per cent and that has inflated the overall city average			1
no other city has had double - digit price growth			2
' ' there is no @entity3 property boom			1
there has been , so far , a @entity65 property boom			1
' but does @entity65 's high prices constitute a bubble ? ' no. ' ' this is the first major growth in @entity65 prices in 10 years			1
' he writes despite the growth of the past 18 months , the average annual rise in house prices in most @entity65 suburbs has been three per cent to four per cent in the past decade			1
' prices have barely kept pace with inflation			2
even with the most vivid imagination , it is impossible to construct a bubble from those facts			2
' and when it comes to believing the myth that there 's an under - supply of land , my @entity17 writes there 's plenty around but all the ' major land developers are sitting ' on them			1
' they drip - feed to the market to suit their own agendas			2
' ' if you want to buy a housing allotment in @entity123 and @entity124 , there are many dozens of options			2
' he quotes no less than five major developers who have big titles of new housing estates going up in south east @entity124 alone			2
' if you want to buy a housing allotment in @entity123 and @entity124 , there are many dozens of options			2
' ' @entity133 is currently marketing five estates in the region			0
@entity136 has four estates in the market			2
@entity139 has five communities under development			0
' there are many others			0
' spring auctions are not always the best time to buy and sell homes , according to @entity18 @entity149 chair @entity148 says it ’s important for aspiring buyers to keep a cool head and steer clear of property spruikers there is no shortage of land across @entity3 , particularly in south east @entity124 were there are ' dozens ' of options property agents have been spruiking @entity3 's housing bubble despite research suggesting otherwise hotspotting also cracks the con that ' @entity32 is the selling season			1
' mr @entity17 says it ’s lavishly promoted by marketing agents and by media as the best time to sell homes – and also the best time to buy , but it ca n't be both			1
' there ’s no evidence that selling in @entity32 gets better prices and it ’s difficult to imagine how it can be the best time to act for both buyers and sellers			2
it ’s a hype-fest , basically			0
' @entity179 of @entity3 has developed a spring buying checklist to help investors and home - buyers make good decisions			1
@entity149 chair @entity148 says it ’s important for aspiring buyers to keep a cool head and steer clear of property spruikers			0
' unscrupulous operators have been quick to eye opportunity in the market			2
' ' steer clear of any so - called property investment experts who wo n’t disclose how they earn their income or push you towards one - size - fits - all property strategies that do n’t consider your own circumstances			0
' 1 a serious housing shortage - vested interests like the @entity199 and @entity200 claim a shortage but never produce evidence – because most of the data disproves the claim			2
2 the affordability crisis - affordability is the best it 's been in 10 years but the industry keeps stating as a fact that young people ca n't afford to buy			2
3 the ' national property market ' - @entity213 chatter about ' the property market ' but there are many thousands of independent local markets all doing their own thing			2
4 the national property boom - it 's amazing how many ' analysts ' look at average growth figures and declare a national boom			1
only @entity65 has boom conditions			1
5 @entity229 prices are soaring - media reports ' spiralling ' prices , when only @entity65 has recorded double - digit growth			1
most cities have only moderate growth rates			0
6 rising prices are a bad thing - media tends to portray rising home values as a problem			0
but for most households , and for the nation , it 's a major positive			0
7 it 's all about interest rates - @entity213 think interest rates are the key factor in price trends , but if that were so all of @entity3 would have booming prices			1
8 the @entity249 is dead - first - home buyers are active but many are not being counted in the stats because grants are no longer available for established homes			0
9 faster approvals is the answer - developers claim easier approvals will make housing affordable			0
it will make developers wealthier			0
10 the inner - city grows fastest - the research contradicts the claim that the so - called prime inner - city suburbs show the best capital growth over time			0
11 distant suburbs do n't grow - in most capital cities , the best long - term capital growth rates happen in affordable suburbs a long way from the cbd			0
12 master - planned is best - in most cities , suburbs created by master - planned developments show inferior capital growth to older , cheaper suburbs nearby			0
13 houses grow faster than units - the dominant paradigm in property , that land content drives value , needs to re-visited			0
more and more are choosing to live in units			0
14 @entity32 best time to sell and buy - the ' spring selling season ' is one of real estate 's biggest cons. it 's marketed as the best time to sell – and buy			1
it ca n't be both			0
15 negative gearing is for rich folk media has created the false notion that negative gearing is a tax break for rich people			0
70 % of claimants earn less than $ 80,000			0
16 negative geared investors drive prices - investors are a minority presence in the market			1
prices are driven by home buyers ( other than first - timers ) who dominate the market			1
17 @entity308 grants drive prices - some economists claim grants hurt first - timers because they push up prices			0
they never produce any evidence to support the claim			0
18 foreign investors are to blame - @entity318 buyers especially are blamed for pricing out young @entity3 buyers , but their price impact in @entity308 areas is close to zero			1
19 economists know real estate - media is obsessed with the real estate views of economists			1
it 's like asking a chess expert to provide expert commentary on football			0
20 economists know anything at all - when their data forecasts are wrong , which is often , economists express shock and amazement , and denounce the official data .			0
