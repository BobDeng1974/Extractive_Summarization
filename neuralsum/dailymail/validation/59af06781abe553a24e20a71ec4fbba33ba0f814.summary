lost : @entity0 disappeared in @entity1 eight years ago police chiefs have been urged to wind up the hunt for @entity0 as detectives battle the terror threat and a spate of murders			1
a team of 31 @entity10 detectives are working exclusively to find the girl , who vanished from her parents ’ holiday apartment in @entity1 eight years ago			1
the @entity14 was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to @entity19 in 2011			1
yet despite costing the taxpayer £ 10million and dozens of trips by officers to the @entity24 , the inquiry – codenamed @entity25 – has not led to a single arrest			1
now a senior police union leader has called for the probe to be axed and the detectives reassigned to other investigations in the @entity10			2
he says officers in @entity32 are bemused why they are working round - the - clock fighting the threat from @entity36 - inspired jihadists and solve at least 14 murders since @entity38 while the @entity25 detectives are barred from helping			2
@entity41 chairman @entity40 said : ‘ it is time to re-focus on what we need to do to keep @entity32 safe			0
we no longer have the resources to conduct specialist inquiries all over the world which have nothing to do with @entity32			0
’ the @entity14 has long been seen as the last resort for investigations others have struggled with elsewhere			2
‘ it is surprising to see an inquiry like the @entity60 investigation ring - fenced			0
i have heard a few rumblings of discontent about it from lots of sources			0
‘ when the force is facing a spike in murder investigations it is not surprising there is resentment of significant resources diverted to a case that has no apparent connection with @entity32			0
’ even though @entity73 ’s parents @entity71 , 47 , and @entity74 , 46 , live in @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity70 was handed the investigation because of its expertise in investigating complex murder case			0
police chiefs ‘ ring - fenced ’ the inquiry to prevent officers working on other case , even though the force has been forced to make £ 600million in cuts over four years			2
@entity25 was set up to review the original @entity1 police probe into the disappearance of @entity73 , then three , from the family ’s holiday apartment in @entity91 on may 3 , 2007			1
the @entity14 launched an investigation into @entity94 's disappearance after her parents , pictured above , made a personal plea to pm @entity19 in 2011 after the @entity1 inquiry was shelved as ‘ unsolved ’ , the @entity98 , who remain convinced their daughter is alive , appealed to mr @entity19 for assistance			1
since the girl , who would now be 11 , vanished , every possible theory has been explored , including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile , killed during a botched burglary and her body dumped , snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident			0
however , not one shred of proof of what happened to @entity73 has been uncovered			0
detective chief inspector @entity116 , who took over @entity25 in december , and her team ravelled to @entity1 to interview seven suspects and four witnesses , but have not released any information about what they discovered			1
a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ there are 31 officers working on @entity25			1
their sole investigation is the disappearance of @entity0			0
