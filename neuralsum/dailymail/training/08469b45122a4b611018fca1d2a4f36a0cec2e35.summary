former virginia governor @entity1 will remain free while he appeals his corruption convictions , a federal court ruled monday			1
' i plan to spend time with my new granddaughter who was born this month , attend my sons ' graduation ceremonies , and embrace family time with my daughters , ' @entity1 said in a statement			1
his wife @entity11 , meanwhile , is still set to be sentenced to prison next month			1
the 4th @entity14 @entity13 in @entity15 said @entity1 's appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact that ' if decided in favor of the accused ' is ' important enough ' to warrant reversal or a new trial			2
disgraced @entity23 governor @entity1 will be allowed to remain free while his appeal winds it way through the @entity14 federal court system the court also said @entity1 is n't a flight risk or a danger to others and that the appeal is n't just a delay tactic			0
it ordered that briefs in the case be filed by march 2 and set a may 12 hearing			0
@entity1 's two - year prison term was set to begin february 9 after a jury last year found @entity1 and his wife , @entity11 , guilty of illegally accepting more than $ 165,000 in gifts including a @entity42 watch , designer clothing , vacations and loans from wealthy vitamin entrepreneur @entity46 in exchange for promoting his products			1
@entity46 testified under immunity as the prosecution 's star witness in a case that exposed the details of the @entity56 ' shaky finances and troubled marriage			0

the @entity66 's appeal is based on the definition of ' official action			0
' he argues - as he has all along - that he did not steer any state money toward @entity46 ' company and did nothing for the firm he would n't have done for any other employer in the state			0
@entity1 was convicted last year of 11 counts of corruption - despite attempts to blame the bribery scandal on his wife @entity80 , who was convicted in the same federal corruption investigation , faces sentencing on february 20 and has not been granted leave from prison pending her appeal prosecutors originally sought a sentence of more than 10 years for @entity1 , whose lawyers recommended three years of community service			1
@entity1 's attorneys asked the court to allow him to remain free on bail while he appeals , arguing that the appeal could take almost as long as the sentence itself and would raise substantial questions , including whether the government 's interpretation of an ' official act ' is correct			1
federal prosecutors opposed the request , saying the appeal is n't strong and that @entity1 's claim that the judge defined an ' official act ' too broadly is n't likely to result in a reversal of his convictions			2
