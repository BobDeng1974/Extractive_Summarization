from the planting and growing to the tending and picking , @entity15 had unparalleled access in shooting many of these never before seen workplaces			1
all access : anonymous photographer @entity15 spent four years photographing marijuana farms in @entity12 , @entity13 stunning photos : grassland is a sweeping look at the very private world of marijuana growing protecting the farms : @entity15 told growers she would never use her real name if she published her photographs in the beginning : smaller plants starting to grow the result is a stunning and sweeping look at a very hidden industry			1
so hidden , in fact , most authorities in the sate of @entity13 can not find these farms			1
@entity15 spent six years in @entity12 before she began taking these photographs in 2010 , right around the time @entity45			1
19 appeared on the ballot in @entity13 , which would have legalized marijuana in the state had it passed			2
and while she did not live there full - time , she still considered it a ' home ' by her own admission			0
these six years not only allowed her to get to know everything about the marijuana growing industry , but also to gain the trust of her subjects , who eventually let her turn the camera on their world			2
' i promised the growers and those i photographed that i would use a pseudonym if the work ever got published , ' she said in an interview , via email of course , with @entity68			2
' as i had spent a lot of time there , i imagined that people would feel more safe if my real name was n’t linked to the project			0

media of any kind was n’t too popular up in the hills			0
' shockingly , she said many growers were happy when @entity45			0
19 did not pass , as they were afraid government regulations might ultimately drive down their profits once the drug was legalized			0
times are changing : @entity15 feels there has been a major shift in how the public feels about marijuana in just the past four years home : @entity15 spent six years in @entity12 before she started taking photographs small groups : many farms only had a few people around , unless it was time for picking she also noted that there has been a major shift in the public 's attitude towards marijuana in just the past four years			1
' i started the @entity131 project when prop			0
