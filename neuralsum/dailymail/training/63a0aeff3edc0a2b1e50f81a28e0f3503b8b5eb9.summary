by @entity0 most in - demand celebrity attributes can either be yours forever ; a nose job , for example , or very temporarily ; the smoky eye look , say			2
the former is a drastic gamble , and the latter is a cheap thrill			2
so when @entity11 noticed the rising trend for eyebrow tattoos that eventually fade - a process which involves filling in your brows with micro-fine ' hairs ' that are inked onto the skin - we jumped at the chance to try it			1
lasting for between 14 months and two years , and costing in the region of $ 700 - $ 1,000 ; semi-permanent eyebrow tattoos promise to bestow you with @entity25 worthy power - brows for a good while , but not forever			1
when i was younger , they were so bushy that i once let a friend - with particularity strong feelings against their bushiness - go absolutely mad on them with tweezers			2
they never fully grew back			0
i was left with brows that are bold in some places , and randomly sparse in others			1
so , like many women , i 've taken to filling in the odd gaps - crudely and unevenly i might add - with my @entity62 brow pencil			0
eager to try out this much - hyped , longer - lasting solution , i enlisted the services of @entity66 ; a @entity68 salon which has seen a sharp increase in demand for their $ 925 ' @entity72 ' service , among models and mortals alike			1
@entity66 has perfected what they describe as ' an advanced brow embroidery technique ' which involves tattooing onto the skin with exceptionally detailed and natural strokes			1
gearing up : to lessen the pain - but not entirely diminish it as i would later discover - i had numbing cream applied to my brows prior to the treatment , held in place for 15 minutes using @entity86 wrap ( pictured ) tools of the trade : the assortment of dyes and the dreaded scalpel instrument ( left ) and me doing my best impression of someone who is not freaking out , as the sharp blade is dragged across my brows ( right ) entering with more than a little trepidation - a semi-permanent tattoo is still an un-hidable addition to your face , let 's not forget - i was first treated to a consultation with the salon 's senior brow specialist , @entity101			2
after discussing my options , i opted to go for the natural look , and @entity101 carefully worked on my patchy brows with a dark pencil to get the shape right ; essentially lengthening them and filling in the gaps , so as to more closely resemble their shape before the tweezers - attack incident			1
after plucking away a few stray hairs , and then letting a numbing gel sit on my brows for 15 minutes , it was time to get started			1
stretched out under a stark lamp on what closely resembled a dentist 's chair , panic set in when @entity101 calmly lifted a glinting , scalpel - like instrument from the tray to my left			0
inking away : the process takes about an hour and a half from start to finish , and the experience feels not unlike going to the dentist my initial reaction : upon first inspection , i was pretty traumatized by my new brows , which i worried were far too dark and blockish , more @entity134 from @entity135 than @entity25 success : a week on from my treatment ( pictured ) , and my brows have settled into normality			1
gone are the sparse patches , and i 'm really pleased with how natural the results are i was told this would n't hurt much , but unsurprisingly , as she took the blade to my brows and started intricately scratching away at my skin , it became less and less comfortable - despite the numbing cream			1
@entity101 carefully etched the brown ink back and forth across my brow - line with what i hoped were realistic strokes for about half an hour ; pausing periodically to check the symmetry and admire her work			0
once she was done , i crossed my fingers and braved the handheld mirror			0
my knee - jerk response : @entity157 help me , i look like @entity134 from @entity135			0
' @entity101 carefully etched the brown ink back and forth across my brow - line with what i hoped were realistic strokes ' in my typically over-polite fashion , i thanked @entity101 profusely and left like a deer in the headlights , scattering back to the office with my very dark , very bold power - brows in tow			2
' they are definitely not too dark , i would tell you if they were , ' my editor assured me , in her equally over-polite manner			0
i could tell she was fibbing			0
one week , and several showers later , however , i 'm pleased to report a total turn around			0
the color has faded and they look much less aggressive			0
queen of the brows : @entity25 ( pictured ) exploded onto the scene in 2011 , rising fast to supermodel stardom and sporting bold eyebrows which have since amassed a cult following hot on her heels : @entity186 model @entity185 's dark brows stand out against her blonde hair ( left ) while @entity188 ( center ) and @entity190 ( right ) have strong brows that closer match their hair color the brow brigade : @entity194 ( left ) is blessed with chunky eyebrows , as is @entity196 ( center ) and @entity198 was the star to bring bushy brows into style for her generation in the 80s browhaus tell me the intensity will continue to fade as they heal , for about six to 10 days , and my editor concedes that the color is perfect , honestly this time			2
' for just shy of $ 1,000 and a manageable level of pain , i am proud to be sporting strong , natural - looking brows ' for just shy of $ 1,000 , a manageable level of pain , and only a short - lived period of panic , i am proud to be sporting strong , natural - looking brows which i do n't have to draw on every morning			1
although i regret to report that i still look nothing like @entity216 , i 'm a total convert to the movement of the semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo .			0

the @entity72 process costs $ *920* , and lasts for between 14 months and two years
