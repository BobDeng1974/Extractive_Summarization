' @entity4 struck after eight minutes to give @entity3 the lead but they were blitzed by @entity5 in a 4 - 2 loss despite @entity0 's gloating , the defeat for @entity3 is actually more beneficial to his @entity8 side while @entity5 's blitz of @entity3 went on to leave the @entity29 red - faced anyway , the fact that a defeat for the champions was beneficial for his current club will not have gone unnoticed either			1
instead , @entity0 seemed to throw his weight behind his former employers rather than clinging on to @entity8 's slim hopes of @entity39 qualification that look like they will only open up if @entity3 's slump continues			0

the 24 - year - old has had his run - ins with the red half of @entity21 before , famously celebrating a goal with his ' why always me ' shirt at @entity11 in 2011 and clashing with @entity70 after a win over @entity5 at @entity72 in the same year .			0
