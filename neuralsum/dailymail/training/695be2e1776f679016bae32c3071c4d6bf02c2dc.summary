when @entity1 started classes at the @entity3 in 1999 , she envisaged that her experience would be centered on the football field as the first female kicker for the @entity7			1
but in 2000 while she was hanging out with a teammate in his appearance , she claims that he raped her			1
the talented athlete revealed her story four years later but the attack was never proven			1
instead of people coming to her support , she was branded a liar and had every inch of her livelihood criticized including her sexual history - even though she was a virgin			1
now 33 years old , she claims that the @entity20 article about ' @entity21 ' has done a ' huge disservice ' to rape victims and that there is a ' major problem ' on college campuses			0
her coach allegedly told her she was a terrible kicker and the scrutiny led to her transferring to the @entity46			1
there should would become the first female player to score in a @entity34 game			1
since the attack almost 15 years ago some of the after effects have warn off , but miss @entity1 says there is still a stigma that follows her around			1
she told @entity53 of the @entity54 : ' to this day , people call me a liar			2
' sometimes i wish they could be there when i get so nauseous and sick that i 'm throwing up and nights i ca n't sleep and when i got into a depressive funk			0
' those times are rare now – it does get better , i want people to know that — but they are still around because it never truly goes away			0
' ' i did n't expect such disregard for my life			0
i was a virgin when this happened and incredibly naive			0
i thought coming forward would force the university to acknowledge it had problems and make changes			2
' there is a definite fear for your safety knowing that someone who is capable of doing something as horrible as raping you is still out there			0
she said the idea of one of her former teammates being falsely accused would kill her			0
however she says that fabricated accounts are rare , but the impact is harrowing			0
she revealed her story in 2004 and was met with intense scrutiny and criticism			1
her accused never went to jail , but since she has spoken to people all over the country about preventing violence ' the attention you get as a rape victim is not fun , it 's awful			0
' miss @entity1 went to the district attorney a short time after the alleged attack took place			1
she did not report it straight away , but insists it is rare for women to react so quickly by telling the authorities			2
she said the hardest thing to hear was the warning that her suspected rapist would probably never be jailed			0
almost 15 years on from the incident , miss @entity1 is now doing speeches about her experiences and she works with numerous organizations dedicated to preventing violence against women			1
she said the magazine had a responsibility to ' her [ @entity21 ] and to the public to make sure they were presenting a story that had been thoroughly researched and vetted and their failure to do that did a huge disservice to all rape victims			2
' i can tell you we do n't have a giant problem with women lying about rape in our society			0
we do have a major problem with women being raped , especially on college campuses .			2
