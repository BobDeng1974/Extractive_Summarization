it 's bound to happen is n't it ? @entity3 's defeat against @entity4 here in the @entity6 saw @entity8 's side relinquish top spot in @entity10 , meaning the @entity11 could now face a much trickier last 32 clash			1
among the sides @entity3 could draw are @entity13 , who are managed by ... @entity15			1
it would be the @entity79 's first return to the club since his unceremonious sacking last december			0
he 'll undoubtedly have something to prove			0
@entity85 , the return of @entity15 would have been the final thing on @entity8 's mind as he watched his side throw away top spot - and the prospect of an easier draw			1
@entity4 were forced to put on two sound and light parties to keep supporters entertained during two floodlight failures			1
@entity8 wo n't be in a party mood as he makes his way back to @entity95 , though			0
the big team news was the return of @entity51 following a nine month lay - off due to a troublesome abdominal injury			2
@entity3 just needed a point to prevent @entity4 from leapfrogging them into top spot			1
@entity8 was adamant ahead of kick - off that finishing top of their pool remained a priority for him and his side			1
he still , though , played a raft of his fringe stars in an attempt to keep his squad fresh ahead of the hectic festive period			0
and the visitors made a bright start , @entity61 just failing to get a head on @entity117 's dangerous cross from the left in the sixth minute before the first blackout two minutes later			2
the home support did their best to brighten up proceedings as thousands of camera phones lit up the pitch black stadium			0
and to their credit , the blackout did n't dampen the noise coming from the small but vociferous home support			0
likewise , club officials were determined not to let the floodlight failure ruin proceedings , blaring some rather questionable @entity131 disco music over the @entity133 system you could forgive the handful of @entity3 fans who made the trip to @entity138 for thinking they were in some dodgy nightclub in @entity140 rather than a football match			1
@entity3 's @entity10 encounter against @entity4 had to be suspended for 13 minutes after the lights went out in the stadium supporters of both sides flashed lights on their personal devices after the floodlights went out in the eighth minute @entity3 playmaker @entity117 evades @entity40 during the encounter at @entity151 finally , after a 15 minute delay the players re-emerged from the tunnel as the lights came back on			1
and the intermission slowed the early momentum @entity3 had started to gather as @entity4 shifted up a gear			1
the hosts were chasing and throwing themselves into tackles like qualification into the next round depended on it			0
perhaps it was the sight of manager @entity24 - in a suit and beanie hat - geeing them up at every opportunity in his technical area			2
however , @entity61 missed an excellent chance in the 16th minute to take the lead , failing to capitalise on @entity58 's clever flick deep inside the penalty area			2
@entity175 had the ball in the net in the 26th minute following @entity57 's through ball - but his well - executed chipped finish was ruled out for offside			1
@entity42 then went close , firing a curling right - foot strike narrowly wide of @entity27 's far post four minutes later , before @entity61 chose to cross instead of shoot in a good position after @entity175 's clever reverse pass			2
despite both sides having already qualified for the next round , there was no hint of anyone taking their foot off the gas - particularly not the hosts			0
there was , though , a distinct lack of goalmouth action as the first half ended goalless			0
even referee @entity69 seemed bored - blowing the half - time whistle four seconds before the 45th minute			0
@entity8 would have been content , if not happy , with his side 's opening 45 minutes			0
they were comfortable if not dominant against a side who were clearly pumped up for the occasion			0
@entity32 sent a long - range effort narrowly over the bar as the second half got underway , before @entity208 saw his cross-cum - shot palmed away by @entity31 in the 55th minute			0
@entity3 stars @entity61 , @entity58 and @entity57 look dejected after conceding a goal against @entity4 @entity3 right back @entity51 made his first appearance for nine months after recovering from an abdominal injury @entity4 forward @entity18 then went agonisingly close to opening the scoring in the 58th minute , smashing a 25 - yard half - volley on to the crossbar after skipper @entity53 had sloppily lost possession			1
but the hosts did n't have to wait much longer to take a deserved lead thanks to @entity18 , who finished from close range after excellent combination play between @entity38 and @entity42			2
and the @entity131 should have doubled their lead in the 68th minute but @entity34 wasted a brilliant opportunity after a defence - splitting one - two with @entity41			0
spurs were on the ropes as @entity8 watched his side lose their grip on top spot in the group , and he introduced @entity62 and @entity59 in search of an equaliser that would keep them in pole position			1
but it was @entity4 who continued to look most likely , @entity41 wasting another chance from deep inside the area in the 75th minute			2
spurs were toiling , and looked void of attacking ideas as the second of the evening 's blackouts occurred in injury time			0
by that time @entity3 's hopes of finishing top were already extinguished			1
@entity51 goes for a run down the right - hand side as he started his first game for nine months @entity3 midfielder @entity57 takes on @entity43 during the @entity251 match @entity3 and @entity4 players talk to the referee after the floodlights failed again in @entity138 fans at the @entity151 had to use their phones after the lights went out to suspend play the @entity151 descended into darkness as the fans used their phones to light up the stands the players and officials were taken off the pitch after the floodlights failed again in the 91st minute the relatively empty @entity151 was reduced to darkness after a floodlight failure @entity8 brought on @entity59 to try and inject some life into @entity3 's side @entity8 included the likes of @entity61 , @entity53 and @entity175 in his starting line - up @entity3 boss @entity8 will have been disappointed with his side 's performance in @entity138 former @entity274 defender @entity24 has helped his side progress to the next stage of the @entity10 as group winners @entity4 ' players celebrate after their 1 - 0 win against @entity3 ensures they finish top of @entity10			1

@entity3 finished second in @entity10 after losing to @entity10 rivals @entity4
@entity18 scored the only goal of the match in the 59th minute to help his side claim top spot
the @entity10 match had to be suspended twice due to floodlight failure in the eighth and 91st minute
spurs could face former manager @entity15 ' @entity13 in @entity294 's second - tier *competition*
