by @entity0 remember those black fridays from not so long ago where @entity1 would turn up with his b game , shoot 40 or so for nine holes and blow his chances of winning ? if truth be told , he had another ordinary friday here at the 96th @entity8 , hitting just eight fairways and 11 greens in regulation			1
how terrifying for the opposition , therefore , that the newly - refocused @entity1 still shot a four under par 67 to add to his opening 66 to lead the season ’s final major at the halfway stage			1
if @entity1 is now able to hit the front playing average , what on earth is going to happen when he showcases his a game ? @entity1 leads by a shot on a good - looking leaderboard from dangerous @entity24 @entity23 and veteran @entity26 @entity25 , with fellow countrymen @entity27 and @entity29 two shots adrift			1
still on top : @entity1 was n't at his brilliant best on friday , but he still takes a one - shot lead into the third round in the swing : the @entity36 is playing as close to perfect as you can get in the majors at the moment then comes @entity40 after a spectacular eagle three at the last and @entity43 @entity42 , with two @entity45 big hitters – @entity46 and @entity47 – four shots behind			1
@entity47 slipped back after his marvellous first round 65 but is still in contention to win his first major after a 73			2
@entity51 was another to regress with a 73			2
@entity52 ? thank goodness he has now gone home after missing the halfway cut by a comfortable margin following a second round 74 because this was painful to watch			1
difficult @entity52 : it was a sad sight to see the 14 - time major champion struggle with injury and form whatever happened to the 14 - time major champion who only ever played to win ? here , he limped around both physically and metaphorically to raise the question again : what on earth was he doing here ? let ’s hope we do n’t see him again until he is healthy - however long it takes			1
as for @entity1 , add these two rounds to the four he played at @entity73 at @entity74 and the 72 holes at @entity76 last week , and that makes him 41 under par for the duration , with only one round in the seventies			1
it ’s worth spelling them out : 66,66,68,71,69,64,66,66,66 and 67			2
if that is not the perfect ten rounds , it must be as close as damn it			2
@entity1 was asked for the umpteenth time why it has all gone right but this time gave a particularly candid answer			1
he did not say or mean it unkindly , but he did pinpoint the moment he ditched his tennis - playing fiancé , @entity94 , at the end of may			1
problems : @entity98 failed to find his best form , and later had to apologise for his behaviour on the course ‘ i think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i ’ve put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me			0
i mean , what else do i have to do now ? ' i go to the golf course , to the gym and it ’s just my life at the minute			0
i worked pretty hard before but the past couple of months i ’ve really just buried myself in my game			0
it obviously works pretty well , so i am going to keep doing it			0
’ a deluge created fresh water hazards in the middle of fairways and caused a 50 minute suspension early on			0
the day called for the steadfast rather than the spectacular , but trust @entity1 to come up with a mixture of both			1
starting from the 10th , he had one eagle three at the 18th and should have had another at the 7th where he missed from 8ft			0
but this was a round where he also showed off some of the overlooked qualities of his game , including his new - found resolve to grind out a score			1
a perfect day : the @entity24 @entity23 is @entity1 's closest competitor after reaching eight under par @entity1 missed his first four fairways plus five greens in regulation in a row at one point , but saved par expertly on several occasions with a few adept up and downs			1
‘ i think when you ’re 100 per cent confident as i am now you know you ’re going to get opportunities to put it right , so i know i am not going to go on one of those runs where i shoot a 42 for nine holes , ’ he said			0
‘ mentally , i am just in a far better place			0
’ @entity1 vowed to keep playing the same brand of smart but aggressive golf that won him @entity74			1
‘ i think the only time i ’ve ever tried to protect a lead was the final round of the 2011 masters and that did n’t work out so well ( he lost a four shot lead ) , ’ he said			1
‘ it took me a couple of years to learn to be comfortable with a lead but what works for me is to try to get four ahead if i am three ahead , and so on			2
do i expect to win ? i would n’t say that			0
but if i execute my game plan , there ’s a good chance			0
’ is there anything that can distract @entity1 from his mission ? there was a fresh obstacle on friday in the form of an insufferable example of self - pity from playing partner , @entity98			1
on the charge : @entity27 picked up eight birdies , more than making up for his three bogeys are n’t devout @entity180 supposed to be able to put things in perspective ? not this one on this day			0
he whined incessantly as his ball flew off in all directions except straight			0
the @entity26 ’s woes were just one more bit of good news for @entity26 @entity190 captain @entity189 , then , but @entity1 donned cloth ears to drown out the constant moans			2
@entity98 at least had the grace to apologise for his behaviour on @entity195 afterwards			0
‘ sorry for my actions today			0
just trying to get better as a person , ’ he wrote			0
while @entity1 was unaffected , @entity199 champion @entity198 – the third member of the group - stumbled to a 74			1
still in contention : an eagle at the last put @entity40 within three shots of the lead at the half - way stage he was a typically class act afterwards , preferring to praise one of his playing partners rather than attack the other			2
‘ when @entity1 hits his driver that long and that straight and his short game is incredible , it is very difficult to beat him , ’ he said			1
‘ you just have to respect how good he plays			0
he ’s definitely the best player in the world			0
’ now , in his 25th major , @entity220 has the chance to make it two wins in two months and make it four majors claimed at the age of just 25			0
anyone out there still doubt the @entity1 era has begun ?			2
