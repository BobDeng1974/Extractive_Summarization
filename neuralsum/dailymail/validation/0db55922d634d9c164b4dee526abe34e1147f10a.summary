with five minutes gone @entity0 embarked on one of his thrilling mazy runs deep into @entity4 territory only to be flattened on the edge of the area			1
if @entity8 was watching , he may well have given a knowing nod			0
the former @entity11 star spoke at length in the build up to this match about how @entity15 are unbalanced in a 4 - 4 - 2 when they play @entity0 , @entity7 and @entity16			1
@entity15 striker @entity0 cuts a frustrated figure during wednesday 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity4 @entity7 jumps for joy and punches the air after giving @entity15 the lead at the @entity22 @entity7 proved his point - literally - sending the @entity24 tumbling to the floor before many had even taken their seats			1
@entity8 's wider point was that the trio - breathtaking when on the front foot but seemingly out of breath when asked to defend - are a luxury @entity33 can ill afford when up against the cream of @entity35			2
with all due respect to @entity4 they are not the cream of @entity35 , rather the dregs of the @entity39 , but they proved his point more than once at a pancake - flat @entity22			2
from the kick - off @entity16 wandered into the visitors ' half			1
it was where he would spend most of the match			0
the @entity48 's lack of an appetite for hard work did not go unnoticed among the blue - collar faithful			2
after one run , in which he was felled on the edge of the box but failed to win a free - kick , he stayed down for what seemed like an eternity			1
@entity15 midfielder @entity16 appeared to go down for what seemed an eternity during the match @entity0 is surrounded by the @entity4 defence as the @entity15 frontman bids to make an opening by the time he got up , @entity4 were on the attack in the @entity15 half			1
it was all too much for one punter in front of the press box who wasted no time in getting to his feet			0
' get up you lazy g * * ' was his frustrated shout			0
nobody told him to shut up			0
against cellar dweller opponents who have four wins from 26 attempts it was unimpressive stuff and perhaps an indication of why , before this encounter , @entity15 had just nine points from a possible 21 in the @entity39			2
it would be remiss , however , to deny that when it works ( and it has won them two titles ) it works well			0
for the opener , @entity16 's surging run ended with a pass to @entity7 in space			1
his flick found an overlapping @entity97 and after some ping pong in the @entity4 box @entity7 prodded home			1
@entity7 prods the ball home past a sprawling @entity103 to give @entity15 the lead in first half injury time @entity16 gestures in the direction of midfielder @entity107 during wednesday 's victory at the @entity22 @entity7 also lofted two delightful balls over the visitors ' defence , one for a misfiring @entity112 and one for @entity0			1
both strikers put their efforts over the bar but it would be very difficult for any manager to drop the graceful @entity118			0
@entity8 's point , however , was reaffirmed on 74 minutes			0
at 1 - 0 , @entity121 's plucky visitors should not have been in with a sniff			2
but in the midst of host of missed opportunities for the home side @entity123 hit a post			0
had that gone in it could have been title race over			0
as it turned out , sub @entity131 made it 2 - 0 after @entity7 had been replaced by @entity134			1
better opposition , however , would have reinforced @entity8 's point even further .			0

@entity15 defeated @entity4 2 - 0 on wednesday night
@entity0 and @entity7 *crashed* into each other during early play
@entity16 spent an eternity on the floor after failing to win a free - kick
