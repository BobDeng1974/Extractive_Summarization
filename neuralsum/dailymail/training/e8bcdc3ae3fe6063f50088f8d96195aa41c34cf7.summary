video : scroll down to watch @entity28 's @entity27 preview of the @entity30 derby this weekend @entity0 appeared in relaxed fashion during @entity5 's training session on friday @entity17 was joined at training by @entity34 , @entity21 , @entity20 , @entity35 and @entity18 ( left to right ) @entity36 is looking to win a place back in @entity14 's starting xi on sunday after serving a three - game suspension in the league @entity5 boss @entity41 was all smiles during the session as he embarks on his first @entity30 derby on sunday @entity21 ( centre ) is in contention to play his first game of the season for @entity5 after recovering from an ankle injury @entity36 looked in a particular determined mood as he aims to fire @entity5 to victory against their bitter rivals following a three - match ban for kicking out at @entity55 's @entity54 during september 's @entity27 encounter			1
the 29 - year - old has scored more @entity30 derby goals than anyone else , having found the net 11 times in 22 appearances so far			1
the @entity62 is a particularly happy hunting ground for the @entity65 striker with seven of his derby goals coming there – including his last five			1
former @entity5 great @entity69 expects @entity36 to take out his pent - up frustration on @entity72 's side after missing the last three league matches			1
the return of @entity36 ( left ) to the starting line - up is likely to mean midfielder @entity34 will be dropped to the bench against @entity7 ' he has got to be raring to go , ' @entity69 said			2
' he is a professional footballer			0
when you miss games through injury or illness or suspension , you are going to be disappointed			0
' i have no doubt he will be chomping at the bit now and ready to go having missed three games			0
' it 's going to be a massive boost to have a player of his quality back			0
hopefully we can go to @entity7 and get a positive result			2
' @entity36 's experience of @entity30 derbies will be vital in helping the club 's new faces know what awaits them at the @entity62			2
@entity100 ( left ) will be hoping to earn the praise of @entity41 after being criticised for his defending in their recent fixtures @entity41 , who is also facing @entity7 for the first time , could field up to six players who have not played in a @entity30 skirmish before			0
but @entity69 is sure the likes of @entity17 , @entity108 and @entity35 will not freeze under pressure against a @entity7 team that will be itching to take all the points following a three - match winless streak			2
' they are professional footballers			0
they have nothing to be scared of , ' added @entity69 , who also spent a year at @entity7 before he retired			2
' they are playing in front of 70,000 every other weekend and those players have played in big games like @entity121 matches and internationals before			0
' they will not be thinking , " i am going to be worried about playing in the @entity30 derby			0
" they will appreciate it			0
' @entity126 ( left ) and @entity127 could be two of many @entity128 involved at the @entity62 on sunday @entity129 , 18 , is unlikely to be involved in the @entity5 squad despite @entity41 's trust in giving young players a chance @entity134 star @entity129 happy at @entity5			1
