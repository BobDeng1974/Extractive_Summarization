@entity4 boss @entity3 was happy to shed his dignity for an office exercise campaign video , swapping his suit and tie for a @entity10 costume			1
but his good intentions backfired when footage showing him warming to his new role was leaked on to the internet			0
the three - minute video , described by @entity4 staff as ' patronising ' and ' embarrassing ' , was intended only for the trust 's employees , but the film was uploaded to @entity45			2

the video begins with a ' stressed ' mr @entity3 at his desk , wearing a shirt and tie , trying to answer several phones at once			1
after taking a call on a mobile phone bearing the @entity56 ' , he spins around in his chair and turns into an overweight version of the comic book hero			0
he starts to sing and wave his arms to the @entity61 hit and leads smiling staff in a dance down the office corridors and stairs			2

comments included : ' what an idiot ! is this what our taxes are being used for ? ' another said : ' there 's something seriously wrong with this man … being paid £ 100k and more to be an idiot			0
' one disgruntled @entity4 employee wrote : ' can not believe he thought this was a good idea , staff morale at its lowest , people having to reapply for jobs , understaffed wards , need i go on			2
