by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 09:51 est , 2 may 2013 a @entity2 call centre has hit upon a novel solution to the problem of providing around - the - clock service - it has sent its staff to @entity7			1
workers there man the phones in the daytime , which is night in the @entity2 , meaning they are fresh and alert at all times			2
telephone - answering company @entity13 cooked up the plan after managers realised that their employees would rather leave the country than work night shifts			1
headquarters : telephone - answering firm @entity13 , pictured , is based in @entity22 , @entity23 contrast : the company has opened a new office in @entity27 , a suburb of @entity28 , to cover the night shift lucky : @entity30 , 24 , has been moved to @entity7 by the company when workers at its base in @entity22 leave the office at 8pm , they hand over to their colleagues in @entity27 , a suburb of @entity28 , where it is then 8am			1
and when the @entity2 staff get back in the next morning , they take over from the ' night shift ' workers , who are free to enjoy their evening			0
@entity30 , 24 , one of four workers who have relocated from @entity44 , said : ' it is a fantastic opportunity - i 'm loving it			1
' it was a bit strange to start with but it works very well - we go to work in the morning just as the staff in @entity22 are going home for the day			1
' i am getting to see places i probably never would have the chance to see otherwise			0
' i have visited @entity55 and both the @entity56 of @entity7 and generally thrown myself into the experience			0
' the staff are living together in a rented house , and work on a cycle of four days on , four days off to enable them to travel around their temporary home			0
they are scheduled to return home soon , when they will be replaced by another set of four employees			0

when customers asked for a 24 - hour service , the firm asked its employees to work nights but nearly all proved reluctant			1
out of 280 staff members , only four said they be willing to work after hours - but 40 were prepared to relocate abroad			2
bosses also realised that having all employees work in the daytime meant they would stay healthy and have a better attitude to work , meaning they would serve clients better			1
@entity98 founder @entity97 said : ' we had looked at hiring staff to work overnight at our offices in @entity22			0
' but we were n't confident service levels could be maintained so would have never taken that risk			0
' by working on the other side of the world we 're now able to offer a truly 24 - hour first - rate service , with bright , chirpy and wide - awake people			0

employees of @entity44 phone - answering company *refuse* to work nights
so firm moves workers to @entity28 so they can work in the daytime
bosses say staff are more *productive* as they work around the clock
