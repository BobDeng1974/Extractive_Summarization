in an interview with @entity45 , he said : ' it is quite a sexist place			1
you do n't hear it on the tv , but some of the comments made in the chamber when some of the women get up and speak … ' and sometimes there have been instances when – i think it 's happened to female colleagues – they have been sitting behind the front bench and wearing a slightly low - cut top , and the whole of @entity63 has gone mad about it , which is quite insulting			1
