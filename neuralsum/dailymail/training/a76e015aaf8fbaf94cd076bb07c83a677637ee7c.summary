prince @entity1 ’s private office came out fighting yesterday after a controversial biography claimed he is riven by insecurities and undermined by his aides ’ feuds			1
officials reacted angrily to the heir ’s portrayal as a man ‘ driven by guilt ’ who flies into fits of ‘ royal rage ’ but can not control his courtiers ’ internal squabbles			1
@entity16 insisted the book by @entity18 – called @entity1 : the @entity19 of a @entity20 – was in no way authorised by the palace			1
officials reacted angrily to prince @entity1 ' portrayal in a new biography as a man ‘ driven by guilt ’ who flies into fits of ‘ royal rage ’ royal aides said the book 's author @entity18 ( pictured ) did not have ' exclusive access ' to the heir to the throne attempting to refocus attention on the @entity1 ’s extensive charity work , aides last night described him as a man who ‘ cares deeply ’ about his country and has frequently been ‘ ahead of his time ’			1
@entity1 is at the heart of a massive international charity empire that in recent years has helped raise more than £ 100million a year for his good causes – which range from rescuing historic buildings to helping young people get a start in life			2
a @entity16 spokesman said @entity1 had devoted most of his working life to ‘ helping individual and organisations make a difference for the better – and not for personal gain ’			1
she added : ‘ he takes an active interest in the issues and challenges facing the @entity56 and around the world through his own work and that of his charities			0
‘ over the past 40 years in his role as heir to the throne , the @entity1 has visited countless places and met numerous people from every walk of life			2
he carries out over 600 engagements a year			0
‘ this gives him a unique perspective which has often led to him identifying issues before others which might otherwise be overlooked			0
@entity16 insisted the book by @entity18 – called @entity1 : the @entity19 of a @entity20 – was in no way authorised by the palace ‘ he is often described as being ahead of his time and the evidence for this has been well documented – and includes leading the work on corporate social responsibility from as early as the 1980s , demonstrating the benefits of organic farming , as well as finding ways to help young people who are not in employment , education or training through his @entity88			1
’ journalist @entity90 , editor at large for @entity91 , claims in her biography that she was given ‘ remarkable access ’ to the @entity1 and achieved ‘ exclusive interviews ’ with his inner circle			1
she was afforded a rare interview with @entity1 for an article published in 2013 and attended a private dinner at @entity99 – the @entity101 stately home @entity1 helped save for the nation – where she was given a tour of the estate by the heir			2
it is also clear she was given access to a number of @entity1 ’s friends , including actress @entity110 , and senior aides past and present			1
some very close to him – such as former foreign advisor @entity112 and long - serving private secretary @entity113 – allowed their comments to be reported on the record , which would never have happened without royal approval			0
but @entity16 stressed the biography was not an ‘ official ’ one and miss @entity18 had no ‘ exclusive ’ access			1
the @entity1 ’s spokesman said : ‘ @entity18 was only given access to the @entity1 briefly for the writing of a @entity91 feature over a year ago			1
‘ she is often allowed to attend events , as part of the rota like any other member of the media			0
’ the book , extracts of which are being serialised in @entity133 , says @entity1 feels compelled to get involved in national affairs because of the ‘ guilty ’ privilege of his birth			2
it also describes him as the ‘ @entity138 ’ with a short fuse and compares his household to @entity141 – a reference to the treacherous world of @entity145 ’s court as evoked in @entity147 ’s novel			0
the @entity1 ’s spokesman added : ‘ @entity16 employs over 100 hardworking professionals , many of whom have been there for decades and whose work and dedication is appreciated by @entity154			1
’ the @entity155 and @entity156 are planning to hire a live - in maternity nurse to help them care for their second child , it was claimed yesterday			0
the couple already have a nanny for 18 - month - old @entity161 but are thought to be looking for an extra set of hands to help with their second child , who is due in april , including looking after night feeds			0
royal aides have apparently been in contact with the @entity169 and @entity170 in @entity171 to find a suitable candidate to work for at least the first three months			2
it is thought the @entity155 is hoping for a swift return to her charity work after giving birth			2
in a break from royal tradition , the couple did not hire a maternity nurse for @entity182			0
instead , @entity156 , 33 , spent almost a month at her parents ’ @entity185 home			0
a source told @entity187 : ‘ @entity156 and @entity188 loved the early weeks with @entity161 but it was hard work and the sleepless nights took their toll			0
’ last night a spokesman for @entity188 and @entity156 declined to comment .			0
