women are ' hardest hit by dementia ' : actress @entity2 was last year revealed to have been diagnosed with ' mild @entity3 ’s ' women are hardest hit by dementia , say experts			1
they can spend years caring for loved ones with the illness only to fall victim to it themselves			0
a report by the charity @entity12 warns that dementia is leaving women ‘ marginalised ’ both as carers and later as patients			1
it states that women are two and a half times more likely to look after someone with dementia , most often their husbands			1
and they are also more at risk of developing the condition themselves , with around 500,000 women having it compared to 350,000 men			1
@entity28 , director of external affairs at the research charity , said women suffer a ‘ triple whammy ’ – as carers , living with the effects of dementia and then dying from it			1
she added : ‘ women are carrying the responsibility of care for their loved ones , only later to be living with the condition			1
‘ women are dying from dementia but not before it has taken a considerable toll on minds and bodies			1
in the @entity48 , dementia hits women the hardest			1
’ ‘ dementia is a life - shattering condition and represents a triple whammy for women			1
more women are dying of dementia , more women are having to bear the burden of care			1
‘ the experiences of these women underlines the urgent need to tackle the diseases that cause this life - shattering condition			2
' in recent decades we ’ve seen increased investment in areas like cancer have a real impact , and we need to emulate that success for dementia			2
‘ only through research can we find ways to treat and prevent dementia , and transform the lives of the hundreds of thousands affected			2
’ an estimated 830,000 people in @entity48 have dementia , a syndrome characterised by a gradual loss of brain functions such as memory and mental agility			0
the numbers with dementia are predicted to rise to 2 million by 2051			0
the illness is becoming increasingly common as more of us live to an age when it is more prevalent			0
it is partly thanks to medical advances in the treatment for heart disease and cancer , which had previously claimed more lives earlier on			0
women ’s life expectancies also are longer than men , meaning they are more likely to get the illness			2
dementia is now the leading cause of death in women having overtaken heart disease and stroke			2
but in men it is third , after heart disease and lung cancer			0
the report , which will be published next month , warns that women over 60 are twice as likely to get dementia as breast cancer			1
it will call for far more funding to be put into research to develop effective treatments			0
plan : prime minister @entity114 ( pictured in @entity115 last thursday ) pledged to make dementia a ' national priority ' in 2013 and increase the amount of government funding for research despite the increasing prevalence of the illness and its toll on society , there is no cure and there are only a limited number of drugs – which can only temporarily halt its progression			0
prime minister @entity114 pledged to make dementia a ‘ national priority ’ in 2013 and increase the amount of government funding for research			0
but charities say it is still too little when compared to the investment into new treatment for cancer			0
in 2013 , £ 503million from charities and the government went to research for cancer compared to £ 73.8million for dementia			2
the report will conclude that the toll of dementia on society in @entity48 will get worse unless it is properly addressed by the government			0
‘ the @entity48 already has a larger proportion of people over 65 than the @entity150 average , and as the number of older people rises steeply , the need for carers will continue to increase , ’ it will conclude .			0
