@entity9 , as she ’s known in her well - to - do circle , has been dating prince @entity10 , 29 , for the past two years			1
she made the brave fashion choice of double denim for her outing and of course , the young fashionista pulled it off in style			2
in her usual low - key bohemian style , the 25 - year - old completed the look with a pair of classic chunky black @entity25 boots , bright red nails and minimal make - up			1
however , while she may look causal , the socialite ’s ensemble is far from economy , with the multi-tone patchwork @entity47 from @entity48 alone retailing at a hefty £ 112			0
she looked liked she might have bought herself something nice as she carried a bag from high - end boutique @entity51 and seemed to be in a world of her own			0
@entity18 seemed to be in a world of her own as she walked carrying a bag from high end boutique @entity51 rumours has reached fever pitch over whether @entity10 , who has been dating @entity18 for two years , is about to pop the question her distracted demeanor might be explained by the swirling rumours that @entity10 is imminently about to ask to marry her			2
however despite growing ever closer to the prince , @entity18 , 25 , has told friends she has no plans of becoming a @entity68 bride within the next 12 months			0
