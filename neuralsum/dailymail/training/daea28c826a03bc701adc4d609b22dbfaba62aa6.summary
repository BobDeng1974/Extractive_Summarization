a student has produced a series of vivid photographs that reveal what the networks that keep us connected to the web look like			2
the images , created by @entity8 from @entity9 , show spectres of @entity11 sweeping and swirling around in bright beams			1
they were produced as part of @entity8 's @entity16 project , which aims to bring the invisible world around us to life			2
@entity9 student @entity8 produced these photographs of the invisible wireless networks as part of his studies			1
@entity8 , who is studying for a phd in @entity25 and @entity26 , used self - designed equipment to create the images student @entity8 created the photographs using a custom - made instrument designed to reveal them			1
it scans continuously for wireless networks , and transforms the signal strength to colour leds			1
the results are multi-coloured streaks of light which twirl and wrap in spaces , showing how they surround objects and people			0
@entity8 has also created an app which can be downloaded for free , for @entity46 devices called @entity47 , which allows people to see the strength of @entity11 around them			1
@entity8 , who is studying for a phd in @entity25 and @entity51 , said he is fascinated with the idea of being able to see the hidden wireless networks which surround us			1
' i call the images " spectres " because wireless networks remind me of ghosts , ' he said			2
' they are there but you ca n't see them with the human eye			0
' the fact we are becoming increasingly reliant on something that we ca n't see intrigues me			0
i wanted to find a way to show the wireless which is around us and also to show how it changes			0
' it is an impossibly fragile and volatile infrastructure that holds our digital technologies together , and shapes the way in which we interact with the digital world			0
' something as seemingly inconsequential as walking around the house will interfere with and reshape their propagation and strength field			0
' close the wrong door , and the bedroom becomes a dead spot for wireless			0
' @entity8 captured the images using a piece of self - designed equipment that converts signal strength into colour images			1
he also has an app available on @entity46 called @entity47 that enables people to measure the strength of @entity11 around them for themselves the images show how @entity11 signals of different strengths surround objects and people			1
they were created using a programme that changes colour depending on the strength of a signal - blue is strongest , ranging to red at the other end of the scale @entity8 created the photographs using a custom - made instrument designed to reveal them			1
it scans continuously for wireless networks , and transforms the signal strength to colour leds			2
the results are multi-coloured streaks of light which twirl and wrap in spaces , showing how they surround objects and people			0
the left - hand image shows how @entity11 signals around a ladder may appear , while the image on the right reveals how @entity11 signals surround people when using their phones @entity8 has also created an app which can be downloaded for free , for @entity46 devices called @entity47 , which allows people to see the strength of @entity11 around them			1
he said : ' i would love other people to get involved and to create their own images using the app. ' i used it as part of an exhibition of my work , where we hung mobile phones from the ceiling and it showed how signal strength was varying as people moved around the room			0
' an @entity143 artist created his own colourful representations showing what @entity11 waves , peaks and pulses would look like if we could see them			0
@entity150 worked with former @entity152 astrobiologist @entity151 last year to learn how the networks move and based the designs on coverage data taken from around the @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity158			0
his results show the shape of the @entity11 signals , and different colours were used to distinguish the different sub channels .			2

a student from @entity9 has made images that ' show ' @entity11
@entity8 made a programme that can measure @entity11 strength
he then took long - exposure photography to expose wireless networks
the results are *stunning* *arrays* of colour in *fantastic* shapes
he has also released an app so can take other similar images themselves
