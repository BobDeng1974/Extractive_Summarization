a migration brain drain has left @entity2 with a workforce in which millions can not understand arithmetic , a study found			1
nearly 700,000 highly numerate @entity2 have left the country for a life abroad since the mid- 1960s , figures published yesterday show			1
meanwhile , almost two - and - a - half million people arrived in the @entity2 with few skills and low levels of numeracy			1
the large number of low - skilled arrivals – compared to a far smaller group of highly numerate immigrants – has brought down the average skill level of @entity2 ’s workforce , a new study shows			1
pictured are migrants in @entity21 the large number of low - skilled arrivals – compared to a far smaller group of highly numerate immigrants – has brought down the average skill level of @entity2 ’s workforce , the @entity22 found			1
its report said that as a result of the population changes , one in four of the adults in @entity2 that do not fully understand numbers are immigrants			2
the findings undermine claims that mass immigration has brought in much - needed skilled professionals to help the economy			0
instead , a large proportion of incoming migrants have been people more likely to take low - paid jobs			0
many of the low - skilled migrants have come from @entity42 and @entity43 , while highly educated arrivals predominantly come from @entity42 and @entity45 , the report said			0

its research covered 166,000 people – nearly 9,000 of them living in @entity2			0
in a numeracy test , emigrants from @entity2 scored 268 points , while people who moved neither out of nor into the country scored just lower – 267			2
however , immigrants into @entity2 scored an average of 234			0
the @entity22 found that between the mid- 1960s and 2011 there were 684,000 highly numerate @entity2 who left the country			1
an almost equal number of mathematically skilled immigrants arrived in @entity2 – but a further 2.4million came with poor numeracy skills			2
study author dr @entity69 said : ‘ immigrants account for one in four of the 9.6million working - age adults living in the @entity2 with low - level numeracy skills			1
immigration has therefore had its biggest impact upon the bottom end of the numeracy skill distribution ; it has led to a significant increase in the supply of low - skilled workers			0
’ the study found skilled @entity2 workers often found better paid jobs abroad			0
those who left for the @entity83 and @entity84 were earning on average £ 2,580 a month in 2011 – roughly £ 500 more than their counterparts in @entity2 .			2
