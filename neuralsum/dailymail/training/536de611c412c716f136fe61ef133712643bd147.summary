by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 24 april 2013 a vibrating belt could help eliminate lumbago or lower back pain the @entity5 belt aims to remedy lumbago and , in particular , to prevent the need for surgery			1
@entity9 is thought to affect 80 per cent of people at some point in their life			1
in many cases no cause can be found for the pain , but age , arthritis , spinal damage and particularly poor posture are usually to blame			2
according to @entity28 , lower back pain costs the @entity29 £ 12 billion each year			1
usually the discomfort is across the lower part of the back and sometimes radiates into the buttocks , the back of the thigh or to the groin			1
the pain is usually worse on movement and sometimes it is accompanied by sciatica ( nerving tingling or numbness down one leg )			0
@entity9 affects 80 per cent of people treatment typically involves painkillers and rest but in severe cases surgery to correct a spinal problem may be needed			1
in extreme cases bladder and bowel function can be affected with limbs becoming very weak			0
this is an emergency and usually means that spinal damage may be causing compression of the spinal cord and nerves			0
early treatment is essential to prevent permanent damage			0
the new @entity61 uses a sensor to detect when a sufferer 's posture is poor			2
in these cases , the belt vibrates to remind the patient that they must change @entity69 the same time the sensor emits all the information it gathers to a computer so a therapist can help monitor the patient ’s posture behaviour			0
by understanding when the patient tends to sit or stand poorly , relevant therapies and exercises can be prescribed			0
it is hoped the new technology will be on the market in 2014			2
‘ for perfect posture and to reduce back pain , interlink your fingers from each hand behind your back , just like prince @entity89 does , ’ advises physiotherapist @entity82			1
‘ this will open up your chest and get your shoulders back and down , reversing the slumping posture many people have while sitting			2
’ and to prevent slumping , the mantra is @entity98 — bum in the back of the chair — she adds			0
poor posture will throw the body out of its correct alignment , so certain muscles become overworked , while others , such as the stomach muscles , start to weaken through lack of use			0
this can cause undue stress and strain , especially on the lower back .			1

@entity9 or lower back pain affects 80 *%* of people
new @entity61 works to stop sufferers slouching
hoped it will be available across @entity121 by in 2014
