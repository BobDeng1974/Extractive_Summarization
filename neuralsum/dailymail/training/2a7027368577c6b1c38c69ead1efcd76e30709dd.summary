militants working for @entity2 ' all - female police force in @entity3 have released a manifesto on the role of women - claiming children as young as nine should be encouraged to get married and condemning beauty parlours as the work of the devil			1
the chilling document , titled ' women in the @entity14 ' , demands women live a completely ' sedentary ' lifestyle and that their role in life should be primarily to remain ' hidden and veiled ' and at the service of men , who are described as their masters			2
the manifesto urges ' pure ' females to ensure they are married by 16 , ' while they are still young and active ' , but insists that children as young as nine can ' legitimately ' marry adult men			1
it goes on to state that beauty parlours and shops selling fashionable clothes must not be tolerated as they are both instruments of the devil designed to encourage women to spend vast amounts of money to change @entity36 's design			1
the document is the first of its kind to be released by @entity2 ' all - female @entity40 and while it claims not to have been written or approved by @entity2 ' leadership , it provides a disturbing look at the way women living under the terror group 's barbaric regime can expect to be viewed and treated			1
to avoid the crucial information being lost to @entity65 terror experts , the counter-extremism think tank @entity66 has now fully translated the manifesto and released its own analysis of its contents			0
in stark contradiction to the way life under the rule of @entity2 is portrayed on social media , the document explains that the primary duty of @entity78 women who join the terror group is to marry a jihadi , then spend their life cooking , cleaning and raising a family			1
it suggests that young @entity78 women who spend their time online boasting of leading an exciting and fulfilling lifestyle under the rule of @entity2 are lying , possibly under pressure from the group 's leadership who want to encourage a greater number of women to travel to @entity3 and marry fighters			1
the document describes how women in the once relatively westernised @entity3 city of @entity95 are now ' liberated ' by laws demanding they are fully covered in public , as it prevents their ' humiliation '			0
despite talk of mass hunger , struggling hospitals , electricity blackouts and a near collapse of the local economy , the @entity54 writer insists that @entity2 has eradicated poverty in the areas under its control and that hospitals are full of ' modern medical technology that could treat all those suffering from chronic diseases , including cancer '			1
' women benefit from a substantial amount of these services , for example the maternity hospital , which provides specialist care for mother and son who are examined by pediatricians who give them the cures they need , the document says			0
@entity125 brides : @entity126 and @entity127 , 17 , left their home in @entity129 , @entity130 , and joined the @entity131 in @entity3 in june last year after becoming radicalised online in training : earlier this week one of the @entity127 twins tweeted this picture , captioned : ' fun day training for self defence in the @entity14 with humble sisters ' in stark contradiction to the way life under the rule of @entity2 is portrayed on social media , the document explains that the primary duty of @entity78 women who join the terror group is to marry a jihadi , then spend their life cooking , cleaning and raising a family the manifesto begins with a lengthy rejection of @entity78 values , including financial systems and scientific research			1
the author attacks studying ' the brain cells of crows , grains of sand and fish arteries ' as a distraction from the fundamental purpose of humanity , to worship @entity36			0
in one of many moments of hypocrisy in the document however , the @entity54 writer states that certain scientific research ' that help facilitate the lives of @entity170 and their affairs are permissible ' , outlining such necessities as including medicine , agriculture and architecture			2
the bulk of the manifesto focuses on the role of women , slamming feminism as contrary to @entity36 's plan and insisting that the roles of men and women have become confused as women no longer fully submit to their master husband			1
this , the author claims , is largely the fault of men , who have allowed their ' @entity36 - given right ' for dominance over women to dwindle , ' forcing women away from their true role ' and leaving them ' confused and complacent ' within the home			2
' because men are serving women like themselves , men can not distinguish themselves from them ... if men were men then women would be women , ' the author states			2
the implication is those fighting for @entity2 are ' real men ' , whereas men living in the @entity204 have become weak and submissive			1
this is something the @entity54 believes angers a @entity36 who made women ' from @entity207 and for @entity207 '			2
shocking : earlier this year @entity209 @entity54 member @entity208 posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a @entity3 man executed for criminal acts in @entity3			0
she was standing alongside young children at the time inside the @entity14 : the leader of @entity40 is believed to be a six foot tall woman named @entity217 , who carries a gun , electric cattle - prod and daggers beneath her religious gowns describing everyday life in @entity95 , the manifesto says that the city has become the primary destination for all foreigners looking to join the @entity14			2
' it is a haven for them to flee with their religion from the oppression of tyrants in the east and west and place in which they are privileged with elegant homes that harbour friends of @entity36 , ' it says			0
' the way of life for women in @entity95 does not differ from that in @entity240			0
security , justice , fairness , healthy living , education and healthcare are all of equal importance in the @entity249 , ' it adds			0
the document paints life in the city as extremely multicultural , with the author listing her immediate neighbours as an @entity255 , a @entity256 and a @entity257			0
' there is no difference between @entity255 and @entity260 , blacks or whites			0
all are under the rule of @entity265			0
it is not possible to live in this @entity265 way in any place ruled by tyrants , who implement nationalism over religion and patriotism over @entity274 , ' the document states			0
' tribes are merged and races join under the banner of monotheism , resulting in new generations within which are gathered the cultures of many different peoples , one a beautiful meeting , and harmonious alliance , ' it adds			0
everyday life : describing everyday life in @entity2 ' @entity95 , the manifesto says that the city has become the primary destination for all foreigners looking to join the @entity14 guns and children : last september a @entity3 woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in @entity95			1
her footage shows several gun - wielding @entity300 women who had left their home country to join @entity2 @entity303 is known about @entity2 ' @entity54 , although they are thought to act as a kind of all - female police force inside @entity95 and in the @entity307 city of @entity240			1
dozens of young @entity209 women have used social media to boast of joining the force – claiming to be doling out savage beatings , punishment lashings , ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of @entity317 sex slaves are imprisoned and raped daily after being sold for as little as £ 27			2
britons including privately - educated @entity319 , 20 , and @entity321 - born @entity320 , 22 , are understood to have joined the @entity54 in @entity95 , helping to patrol the city with guns and daggers hidden beneath their religious robes			2
other @entity326 believed to have been joined the @entity131 include the @entity130 - born ' terror twins ' @entity126 and @entity127 , who have 28 @entity328 's between them			0
the group , which is largely made - up of educated @entity78 women , operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in the city - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that are n't black , or those wearing veils made from the wrong material			1
thanks to the head - to - toe niqabs all women living in @entity2 - held territory are forced to wear , the @entity54 also acts as a @entity346 secret police force - with members covertly spying on men suspected of wrongdoing , before reporting them to @entity2 ' feared @entity351 religious authority			1
although the figures are impossible to independently verify , the @entity352 ( @entity353 ) believes as many as 60 @entity209 nationals are currently members of @entity40 .			0

@entity2 report *details* life of extreme oppression faced by women joining @entity2
women are forced into life of cooking , cleaning and *childbearing* for jihadis
all - female police force said it is fine for adult men to marry girls aged nine
@entity54 insists that all ' pure ' females should be married by 16
