by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 2 october 2012 a @entity2 high school principal has been forced to apologize for an outdated dress code policy that left several young ladies weeping in tulle			1
half the girls who arrived to attend the @entity8 homecoming dance were barred from entering because their hemlines showed an inch of thigh - a length deemed dangerous because it revealed the girls ' knees			1
but the school dress code states that teens could wear dresses that ' at or near knee length ' causing confusion and shattered dreams on an evening that was supposed to celebrate the beginning of the school year			1
all but one of the girls pictured were turned away from the dance scandal : half the girls that arrived to attend the @entity8 homecoming dance were barred from entering because their hemlines showed an inch of thigh - a length deemed dangerous because it revealed the girls ' scandalous knees			1
both these young ladies were turned away at the dance knees : but the school dress code states that teens could wear dresses that ' at or near knee length ' causing confusion and shattered dreams on an evening that was supposed to celebrate the beginning of the school year students believed they were following the dress code when they spent hundreds of dollars on their festive wear , but one by one , were turned away			1
as many as half the students were rejected at the door			2
' it was just utter shock at first , ' said @entity57 to @entity58			0
' here we are spending all this time and everything and then we get there and they just turn us away			0
it 's just kind of depressing			2
' parents who were dropping their children off , after first taking memorable snapshots of their teens , were also flabbergasted at the melee			1
' if you 're going to arbitrarily paint scarlet letters all over children , then something has to change , ' @entity70 , @entity57 's mother , said			2
many parents and students shared their frustration on a @entity79 page titled ' @entity80			2
' more than 3,300 people liked it by this morning			0
tears : students believed they were following the dress code when they spent hundreds of dollars on their festive wear , but one by one , were turned away , including these two girls policy police : as many as half the students were rejected at the door , including these two girls poise : some girls were told that they could come back into the dance if they purchased opaque tights on the site , mothers and daughters posted photographs of their dresses and smiles before the dance , explaining how many of them paid to get hemlines taken out and shoulder straps extended to make the look more modest - to no avail			1

' they told me that it was showing my knees so therefore it was too short , and in order to get into the dance i needed to put on leggings , ' @entity138 said			2
' so i did and i got back in the dance , but that was before i realized that this thing was going to turn into such a big issue			0
' the principal insisted that the dress code was posted before the dance , but that the vague rule that ' dresses should be at or near knee length ' had disastrous consequences			1
' it 's been our dress standard in our previous handbooks but the vagueness seemed to come to the surface this time and , again , it needs to be addressed and we 'll get it fixed , ' principal @entity151 said to @entity58			1

he promised to host a replacement dance at a future date			1
this silly photo was taken before the dance and the heatbreak ' i apologized that we had those who came thinking they were meeting the standard and doing what they were supposed to who still got turned away , and it being a very disheartening , sorrowful night of sadness and frustration			1
' ' if you 're going to arbitrarily paint scarlet letters all over children , then something has to change			0
' mother , @entity70 he said it was n't his administrations intention for the evening of fun to leave students ' heartbroken and disgruntled and confused			0
' students say the apology is n't good enough			0
many of the girls felt the school had publicly shamed them , their dates , as well as their bodies			0
' other than the fact that it is ridiculous that we spend time and money to get dresses and then do n't even get to wear them for what they were purchased for , do the school officials know that it is also embarrassing to be told that you are immodest in front of your date ? does n't part of our school motto have something to do with empowering the students of @entity240 ? ' @entity234 said			0
' because this sure was n't empowering to me			0
