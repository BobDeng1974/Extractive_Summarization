you may be mystified as to why your phone ’s battery can drain in a matter of hours			0
and while mobiles have a large number of adjustable settings which can be tweaked to prolong battery life , they are often tricky to understand			0
now there ’s a free app that offers users personalised advice about how to boost their phone ’s battery life			1
a free @entity15 and @entity17 app called @entity18 offers frustrated smartphone users personalised advice to boost their phone 's battery life			1
a screenshot showing distribution information is shown left , and a @entity23 , which indicates how a device ’s battery life compares with others running @entity18 , is shown right called @entity18 , it uses crowdsourced measurements to work out how much of an impact certain settings and apps are having on a specific battery , before advising users what to do			1
after using their phone normally for around a week , people who download the app will start to receive personalised recommendations for improving battery life			2
this is because the app intermittently takes measurements about the device and how it is being used			0
these measurements are sent to @entity18 ’s servers and ‘ thrown into a statistical stew ’ so that the measurements can be used as a benchmark to compare how power - hungry a certain device is			1
@entity18 uses crowd - sourced measurements ( illustrated ) to work out how much of an impact certain settings are having on the battery and what users can do about it			1
users who download the app can use their phone normally , and after a week , will start to receive personalised recommendations for improving their battery life @entity18 analyses a specific phone 's energy use , drawing upon crowd sourced information			1
it offers users recommendations on how to boost the battery life of their device			0
for example , it might point out that @entity70 is using an unusually large amount of power compared to on other phones , indicating that either an individual is hooked on the social media app , or that it could contain an energy - sapping bug			1
an ‘ action list ’ is shown on the main screen of the app , with instructions such as ‘ @entity80 ’ or ‘ @entity81 ’ along with an estimate of how much battery life will improve if a user takes the recommendation			0
a j - score is also given that indicates how a device 's battery life compares with other @entity18 users ' devices			1
a @entity93 section advises which apps to close , while a @entity95 section points out those that are in a bad state			0
non-identifiable information from phones is collected to build up the main database used as a benchmark for energy consumption			1
the results of the analysis are then sent back to the app , in order to give users instructions on what to do to improve the life of their phone			2

‘ the information displayed by @entity18 changes over time as it learns - the longer you use it , the better the results get , ’ according to the researchers behind the app. users will also see a ‘ @entity87 , ’ which indicates how a device ’s battery life compares with others running @entity18			1
it 's expressed as a percentage , so a j - score of 75 means a device has a better battery life than three out of four smartphones - and users can get a score for a comparable model too			2
apps listed under the title of ‘ @entity93 ’ are shown to be energy - hungry and closing them could result in battery life			2
similarly , @entity18 lists some apps under ‘ @entity95 , ’ which are associated with increased energy use on an individual user ’s phone			1
‘ in other words , it may be that your instance of the app is caught in a bad state or has a bad configuration , ’ the researchers behind the app wrote			0
apps and settings listed under the title of ‘ @entity93 ’ ( shown left ) are shown to be energy - hungry and closing such apps could result in battery life			2
the confidence level ( shown right ) indicates how likely it is that closing an app will make a difference to battery life ‘ restarting the app may help if it 's a transient problem , but , if not , you may need to close and avoid the app. ’ as well as being a tool for consumers , @entity18 is a research project run by computer scientists at the @entity177 and @entity178			1
‘ we want to know whether it is possible to take sparse , incomplete measurements from a large community of mobile devices and figure out which apps are abusing the battery , ’ they said			2
‘ we want to find bugs and simultaneously help users mitigate their ill effects and help developers fix them			0
while it 's relatively easy to find a link between energy consumption and screen brightness and connectivity , the experts are unravelling the energy impact of the combination of roaming , high operating temperature , and bad signal strength , for example			1
recommendations could lead to less charging ( stock image ) while it is relatively straight forward to find a link between energy consumption and screen brightness and connectivity , the experts are unravelling the energy impact of the combination of roaming , high operating temperature , and bad signal strength , for example			1
the researches have so far found that @entity214 signal strength dropping one bar can cause 13 per cent battery loss , and high temperature can cause 50 per cent battery life loss , even if the heat does n’t come from the cpu inside a smartphone or tablet			0
automatic screen brightness is in most cases better than the manual setting and together , battery temperature and distance travelled ,			0
offer a good predictor of battery lifetime			0
‘ we believe that , as our dependence on mobile devices increases , energy bugs will rise to prominence , and we want to begin developing tools and techniques for detecting and fixing them			2
’ their research is based on a large dataset that currently consists of device usage data gathered from more than 150,000 smartphones and tablets			2
it covers life daily usage patterns and , together with laboratory based specific high precision measurements , serves as the basis for the research work			0

@entity18 app , for @entity15 and @entity17 devices , was produced by @entity276 and @entity178 , @entity278 computer scientists
uses crowdsourced data to *investigate* a phones ' energy consumption
*monitors* phone usage over a week , feeding data to a central server
information is analysed and personal power - *saving* tips given to users
**suggestions** *include* shutting certain apps down or *upgrading* *software*
the longer the app is used , the more *tailored* the **suggestions** become
