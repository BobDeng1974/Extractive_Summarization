workers punching in for the graveyard shift should avoid steak and spinach , as new research shows eating foods high in iron disrupts the body clock			2
the body 's circadian clocks regulate sleeping , waking and digesting food over a 24 hour period			0
these cycles activate processes in all the cells in the human body , affecting the release of hormones controlling metabolism and other functions			0
shift workers should avoid eating foods rich in iron - such as steak - late at night , as it disrupts the body clock and could increase the risk of obesity , diabetes , stroke and cancer the brain is the body 's ' master ' circadian clock , ensuring all the other body clocks are in sync			1
it is set by light , telling us to wake up in the morning and sleep when it 's dark			0
night shifts disrupt this natural cycle , and it is known that people who work these have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes , obesity and cancer			1
researchers have now discovered that eating iron - rich foods disrupts the circadian clock in the liver , which helps maintain constant blood sugar levels to give body cells enough energy			1
normally the liver 's circadian clock maintains a constant blood sugar level when a person is asleep			1
the level then spikes just before they wake up			0
@entity58 acts like a cog in the liver 's circadian clock , prompting the liver to go into overdrive , strictly controlling blood sugar levels , preventing the spike			1
this would be healthy when it occurs in the liver 's natural clock cycle			1
but if it happens at a time that is out of sync , such as during a night shift , it could result in abnormal blood sugar levels			1
for night shift workers , the circadian clock of the liver is already out of sync with the brain 's circadian clock , and eating iron could exacerbate that lack of synchronisation			1
this could lead to diseases like obesity , diabetes , and stroke , the researchers said			0
iron - rich foods include : as part of the study researchers fed iron to mice as part of their natural eating cycle			1
they found that iron in the diet increases the concentration of heme , an oxygen - carrying compound found in haemoglobin , in cells			0
when heme binds to a circadian protein , the protein 's activity increases			0
this causes the liver to increase its activity of controlling blood sugar levels			2
therefore , eating iron - rich foods caused the liver to increase its activity in regulating blood sugar			1
this interferes with the normal fluctuations associated with a healthy metabolic system and leads to diseases like obesity , cancer , diabetes and stroke			2
the study 's lead author @entity123 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity125 said : ' @entity58 is like the dial that sets the timing of the clock			0
' discovering a factor , such as iron , that sets the circadian rhythm of the liver may have broad implications for people who do shift work			2
' another of the study 's authors professor @entity137 , also of the @entity125 , added : ' when a shift worker eats foods high in iron at night it could exacerbate the lack of synchronsation between the clock in the liver and the main one in the brain			2
' by tending to flatten the circadian variation of metabolism , high iron in tissues may also interfere with the normal day to night fluctuations associated with a healthy metabolic system			0
' the study appeared online in the journal @entity154			0
previous studies have found that shift workers experience higher incidences of obesity , diabetes and other metabolic disorders due to disruptions to their circadian clocks			0

eating iron - rich foods disrupts the circadian clock in the liver
liver 's circadian clock normally regulates blood sugar levels
@entity58 causes the liver to control blood sugar more strictly
this would be healthy if it happened in the liver 's natural cycle
but for people who work night shifts , it puts the liver 's clock out of sync
leads to increased levels of obesity , diabetes , stroke and cancer
