by @entity0 published : 02:48 est , 2 april 2014 updated : 06:34 est , 2 april 2014 a @entity3 - born man living in @entity4 has won the right to be legally recognised as neither a man or a woman			1
' @entity8 ' , who only goes by their first name , underwent surgery to become a woman but has won the right to be considered ' gender neutral ' in a case that could have repercussions around the world			1
the @entity18 had gender reassignment surgery in 1989 but stopped taking hormones and now sees their sex as ' non-specific '			1
the decision is a first and has similarities to cases before the courts in the @entity33 after a grueling @entity37 hearing , a panel of judges agreed			0
the case was referred to the highest court in the country by the @entity41 of @entity42 after @entity8 applied for a name change and attempted to register as having no gender			2
the registrar first granted @entity8 's wishes but later reneged			2
@entity8 challenged the decision and eventually the @entity48 found the registrar was legally able to recognise genders other than male and female			0
@entity8 wanted to be known as neither male or female - and an @entity4 court agreed that a person should have the right to consider themselves ' gender neutral ' in a landmark case worldwide that finding was challenged by the registrar and the case moved to the @entity37 in november last year			1
a full bench of the court released its historic findings on wednesday			0
' not all human beings can be classified by sex as either male or female , ' the finding reads			0
' the question in this appeal is whether it was within the registrar 's power to record in the @entity73 that the sex of the respondent , @entity8 , was , as she said in her application , " non-specific "			2
that question should be answered in the affirmative			0
' the court ordered the state pay @entity8 's appeal costs			1
' not all human beings can be classified by sex as either male or female , ' the court found the court also found that the @entity86 ' recognises that a person 's sex may be indeterminate '			0
they dismissed the appeal of the @entity89 , ordered them to reconsider @entity8 's application ' in accordance with these reasons ' and ordered @entity8 's costs of appeal to be paid by the registrar			1
it is expected the finding will pave the way for people in @entity102 and @entity4 to register as gender neutral			1
landmark : @entity8 's lawyers expect the finding will apply to other @entity4 states with similar legislation ' many other people let me know they wanted to ( identify as non-specific ) in @entity4 and indeed around the world , ' @entity8 told reporters in @entity18			1
' maybe people will understand there 's more options than the binary			0
' as the decision was made in @entity4 's highest court , it is expected to be binding on other @entity4 states - such as @entity121 and @entity122 - with similar legislation			2
the @entity3 - born @entity8 underwent sex - change surgery in 1989 but decided to stop taking hormones the case has similarities with that of @entity128 , currently before @entity33 courts			1
@entity130 is suing former employee @entity131 , an @entity133 catering company , for $ 518,000			0
@entity130 alleges in a lawsuit that coworkers commonly used female terms when referring to them despite them identifying as gender neutral , @entity134 reports			0
the lawsuit claims @entity139 ' cried regularly at work and at home during this time '			0
in a similar case in the @entity33 , @entity143 lawyer @entity142 ( pictured ) is currently representing an @entity133 person who identifies as gender neutral			2
