by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's not a secret that labour can turn a woman into someone they never even knew existed ... whether you 're cursing at your husband , your doctors or just to yourself , the experience of giving birth is something every mother can relate to			1
now @entity19 has asked doctors and nurses to share their most memorable child birth experiences , ' doctors , nurses who deliver babies , what are some strange or funny things people have screamed while giving birth ? , ' ask @entity19 wrote			1
from gas induced delirium , to pain wrenching abuse , these @entity19 users have seen it all			1
' when my brother was born , they had to use forceps to get him out			1
my mom saw them and screamed " those are @entity48 ! you are not putting any @entity50 in there ! " ' ' my mothers labour was extremely short , i was born within an hour			1
so that means that she went from experiencing minimal pain , to extreme pain with little time to adjust			2
when my dad was driving her to the hospital , he unfortunately had to stop for gas			2
he went into pay , and just then an elderly man in a wheelchair stopped him , asking him to buy cigarettes for him as the store was not wheelchair accessible			2
my mom then proceeded to lean out the window , yelling " dont help the cripple			2
" ' ' my mum apparently said , upon viewing my brother whose head and face had become rather misshapen during his protracted journey down the birth canel			1
" noooo ! put it back in ! " ' even one mother in labour tried setting up her baby 's daddy with one of the doctors who assisted in the delivery			1
' so while this woman is pushing out her baby she begins to half tell / half scream that my roommate should date her ex / the baby daddy			2
the conversation went something like this : @entity93 : you should really ...			0
( screams in pain ) ...			0

he 's really @entity97 : i would n't mind some drinks sometime , what are you doing this evening ? ' something to keep in mind before falling pregnant , once you are pregnant there is no way going around giving birth ; ' patient fully dialated , started pushing , then changed her mind			1
" i do n't wan na do this , i 'm going the f * * k home			0
" and then tried to get off the table			0
' ' my wife told me , in a satanic voice , to " get better ice chips , these suck ! "			0
i am not sure what the quality issue was , but i ran and got her a different cup full			0
' but thankfully there are pain killers to help numb the pain for some women			0
' i was high on meds at the time , i was begging for bbq ribs in between contractions			0
" c'mon , honey ! the nurses will never know ! " they were standing right there			1
' ' anesthesiologists are angels straight from heaven			0
' ' my husband told me when i was breathing the laughing gas i screamed " i 'm lady @entity136 ! " as i was pushing			1
then i asked the doctor if he felt my tonsils when he has his arm up there			1
' ' my mum said , " what did i have ? " and the nurse said , " you have n't had anything yet , dear			0
