@entity0 says she earns the equivalent of £ 70,000 a year in benefits because she wo n't go to work for a low salary a mother - of - three says she is caught in a ' benefits package trap ' equal to a salary of £ 70,000 a year			1
@entity7 says she can not afford to work – because it would leave her worse off and her children would no longer qualify for free university places			0
ms @entity0 , 49 and her three children aged 19 , 18 and 14 live in a spacious semi-detached three - bedroom with its own drive and 80ft garden in up - market @entity16 , @entity18			1
she drives a four - wheel @entity19 and her 26 ft lounge boasts a 42 inch flatscreen tv			1
instead of going out to work , she spends her days writing novels – as yet unpublished – and walking her two pedigree white @entity25 dogs			0
her life is funded by the taxpayer , yet privately educated ms @entity0 – who before her divorce lived in a £ 1.6million seven - bedroom house complete with housekeeper – claims every day is a struggle			1
' people might call me a scrounger but i do n’t like living like this , ' she said			0
' so my children do n’t have to share a bedroom , i ’m forced to sleep in the lounge			0
and having lived in a house with five bathrooms , it ’s hard fighting over the one bathroom that we all have to share			1
' then whereas once i thought nothing of spending £ 230 on the weekly supermarket shop at @entity47 and @entity48 now i find myself having to choose between petrol and food from @entity51 and @entity52 on the table			1
' but she blames the government for creating a benefits ‘ trap ’ that means she can never earn so much money as she gets in handouts			2
ms @entity0 , who recently turned down two jobs because they did n’t pay enough , says : ' it ’s not that i ca n’t find a job – i went for two last week and was offered both of them - but myself and the children would be worse off			1
' we could n’t afford the rent on the house			2
and the children would have to take out student loans to fund their university fees			0
that means they would start their working lives in debt , something i would n’t want			2
' a former chartered accountant , ms @entity0 once earned £ 120,000 working in the @entity79			1
but 18 years ago , after her second child was born she gave it all up to be a stay - at - home mother			1
her ex-husband worked as a financial advisor and the couple had no money worries			2
' five of the bedrooms had their own ensuite bathrooms			0
we had a holiday home in @entity102			0
the children went to private schools and i drove a £ 35,000 @entity106 car			2
' domestic chores were left to a live - in housekeeper , leaving ms @entity0 , who worked part - time for her husband , free to lunch with friends and go horse - riding every day			1
ms @entity0 's financial ' woes ' started after she divorced her husband but after growing apart , in november 2007 the couple split and have since divorced			1
it was then ms @entity0 ’s financial nightmares began			1
' by the time we ’d paid back our borrowings and debts , i was left with virtually nothing , ' she says			0
' my ex now claims he ’s only able to pay me £ 13 a week maintenance for the children			2
' ms @entity0 intended going back to work as an accountant but could n’t afford the £ 5,000 plus fees necessary to retrain after such a long break , leaving her with the only option of claiming benefits			1
she now receives £ 32,800 in benefits – which per month includes £ 1,400 housing benefit , £ 152 in council tax payments , £ 403 tax credit , £ 394 in employment and support allowance , £ 84 for free school meals and £ 180 for travel to school			1
child allowance adds a further £ 130 a month			2
on top of that , because she is on benefits , her eldest child qualifies for a grant , which pays for the £ 3,500 a year fees			1
there is also an £ 800 a year bursary towards buying books			1
her second child , who is off to university in october , will also have the £ 9,000 a year fees paid by the taxpayer and will qualify for help towards books			1
ms @entity0 said : ' i always wanted to be able to put the children through university			1
i never wanted them to graduate with debts			0
if i get a job , my children will be forced to take out crippling student loans			2
' she added : ' because i ’m on benefits the whole family qualifies for free dental care , free eye care and free school trips , which would cost extra £ 200 a month			1
i have totted up our benefits package and i would have to earn around £ 70,000 before tax to be able to live as we do now			1
' just to earn the basic £ 32,800 we receive in benefits , i would have to get a job paying over £ 44,000 a year			1
' pictured during happier times with her family on holiday at @entity176			0
ms @entity0 drives a 4x4 and lives in a semi-detached home in @entity179 however , ms @entity0 says even a salary of £ 40,000 a year might not be enough to force her off benefits – because by the time she is taxed she could be left with less than she gets on the dole			1
' i already struggle to feed us all and pay the bills			0
luckily my retired parents – who are not rich by any means – help as much as they can			0
' i ’m sure people might say " oh , what a sponger she is " but although i do n’t feel guilty for claiming benefits because for years i was a high rate tax payer , i 'd much rather go out to work and earn that money with a proper job			1
' i feel ashamed telling people i ’m on benefits			2
however , i have to put my kids first			0
it ’s no good me going out to work if i ca n’t afford the roof over their heads , food on the table and they have to go into debt if they go to university			0
' she admits some people have suggested she save money by getting rid of her beloved dogs , ' but although they do cost around £ 40 a month to feed and i recently had to pay a vet ’s bill for £ 300 , they are elderly and have health problems			2
i do n’t think anyone else would take them on			0
' she also defends her decision to drive her seven year - old @entity219			2
' we live in a rural part of @entity16 and need a car			0
following an accident a few years ago , i ’m visually impaired in my left eye			2
so i need a car that is higher up so i can see the road properly			0
' and she is unable to move to a cheaper property			0
' @entity229 here are expensive			0
although the house has been extended downstairs the bedrooms are really quite tiny			2
after living in such a big house , we could n’t imagine being in something even smaller			2
' ms @entity0 used to live in a £ 1.6million house			1
she now rents a property for £ 1,400 a month ms @entity0 says it is also not worth her working part time			1
' i can work up to 16 hours a week and still claim but when i looked into it , i would lose so much in benefits , i would end up working for free			2
' last week she went for two job interviews – and was offered both jobs			0
' one was promoting a gym and the other was selling expensive wines			0
but the first one paid only £ 6.35 an hour and although the second said they expected me to earn over £ 25,000 a year , there was no guarantee			1
so i was forced to turn both down			0
' a year ago ms @entity0 tried to set up her own party events business			1
' i ’d got as far as putting up a website when i was hauled into the benefits office and accused of fraud			0
after three months investigating they realised i had n’t made a penny but it was a horrible experience			0
' ms @entity0 believes the government should allow people to get a job or set up a business and still pay benefits , gradually reducing the amount as they earn more			1
' that way i could have taken the job selling wines			0
or seen if i could make a go of my business idea			0
' she would also like to see more done for women like her returning to work after bringing up kids			0
' there should be more financial help for women to retrain			0
' ms @entity0 , who hopes publishing a novel will eventually get her off benefits , added : ' i am sure people will think , how outrageous it is that i get all these benefits			1
i bet this makes hard working people very angry			0
' but anyone can fall on hard times and i ’m just telling it as it is			0
i do n’t like the benefits trap i find myself in any more than anyone else			1

@entity0 , 49 , says she can not find a job that pays the same as benefits
lives in a semi-detached house , drives a 4x4 and has a 42 " flatscreen tv
was qualified accountant on £ 120,000 a year but has not worked for 18 years
benefits she receives are equivalent to earning £ 70,000 a year before tax
