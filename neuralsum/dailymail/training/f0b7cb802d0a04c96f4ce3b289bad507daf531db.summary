speaking at @entity28 before the team flew out , assistant manager @entity27 said : ' @entity0 has been left behind			1
he is on a booking so we will rest him and i think he deserves a little rest			0
' @entity1 stayed at home , he will be ready for the weekend			2
' but we will approach it the same as every other game , the exact same preparation			0

@entity18 's side have won their last three matches in all competitions heading in to thursday 's tie ' the lads have done terrifically well in qualifying			2
' it is a nice position to be in but ultimately we want a result and we want a performance			0
' we can go and enjoy the game but you only enjoy it if you play well and get a result			0
' there is a chance there will be one or two changes but not too many changes , that is always dangerous			0
