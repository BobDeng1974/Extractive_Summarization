by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity4 judo silver medallist @entity2 admits it will be somewhat surreal fighting for gold at the @entity7 in @entity8 on the same day as her husband @entity9 - but intends to ensure bragging rights for @entity11 when they get back home			1
@entity2 ' emotional semi-final victory at @entity14 , when she paid tribute to her late mother , was one of the most memorable moments of @entity19			1
however , the 27 - year - old - who suffered a broken thumb en route to her @entity4 success - has only recently returned to the @entity24 following a terrible run of fitness problems which included a fractured wrist , shoulder reconstruction surgery and ankle issues			2
silver lining : @entity2 kisses her medal after winning it at @entity19 rivals : @entity34 will be competing for @entity11 , whilst husband @entity9 will represent @entity35 in @entity8 after being drafted into a 14 - strong @entity11 squad following injury to another @entity8 hopeful , @entity36 - based @entity2 is determined to make the most of her opportunity to show her true talents once again			1
@entity2 and @entity9 - one of @entity35 's leading medal hopes after deciding to take up a place at under - 100kgs in the team he helps coach - are both set to fight on the final day of competition at the @entity49 next weekend , with judo back in the @entity7 for the first time since @entity52 2002			1
' i have never competed for @entity11 before , it has always been @entity54 , and that is the same for @entity9 , and we are set to compete on the same day			1
' it will be strange , but also quite cool because i do n't think there are many other athletes out there that get to say they are competing in a @entity7 with their husband , but for different teams , ' she said			1
' even though i am competing for @entity11 , i live in @entity35 now and train up there full - time as well , so it will feel like a home games for me			1
' @entity2 added : ' i had not competed on the international stage in about nine months , and as any athlete knows , if you have had that amount of time off , then it takes another good couple of months to get your fitness back , especially with a sport like judo , which is so technical			0
' you just have to keep going through the injuries , getting back on the mat and turning up for training			0
it is more the stuff like the rehab which takes it out of you mentally			0
' but i fully believe i am the best player in that weight category and believe i can win			0
' i am going for the gold , nothing else is going to be good enough for me , that is my goal			2
' emotion : @entity2 crying after she guarantees herself a medal during 2012 victory @entity90 : the moment she defeated @entity92 's @entity91 to secure silver @entity9 , born in @entity94 , @entity95 , but raised in @entity36 , endured starkly different emotions at the @entity19 , following a bitterly disappointing first - round exit when he had targeted a place on the podium			1
the 35 - year - old , once ranked in the top four at half - middleweight and a twice former world championship bronze medallist , opted to fill a vacant slot on the @entity106 squad for @entity8 at under - 100kgs - which comes with its own hazards			2
' he stepped up from under - 81kgs , but at under - 90kgs , @entity35 have a lot of good fighters			2
however , at the weight above , they have only got one and you can take two in each weight , ' @entity2 explained			0
' as @entity9 is a coach at @entity106 now , he was like " there is no way i can actually take someone 's spot			2
i do n't feel comfortable with that " - so now he is fighting some monsters			0
' when he was at a tournament in @entity126 , he was in the final against a big @entity128 and got thrown so hard on the back of his head he was knocked out , but he is big guy and can look after himself			0
' i am not worried because we both know what judo is like and you very rarely get serious injuries and is a sport we both love doing			0
' he will be fine - i just have to stuff him full of burgers to get his weight up before fights			0
