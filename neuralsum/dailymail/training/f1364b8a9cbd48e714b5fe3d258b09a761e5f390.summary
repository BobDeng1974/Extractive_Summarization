by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 6 august 2013 @entity2 scientists have recreated the world 's most famous painting on the world 's smallest canvas , which measures just 30 microns in width			1
the @entity8 , originally painted by @entity9 , has now been ' painted ' on a substrate measuring one third of the width of a human hair , using tiny chemical reactions			1
the scientists believe ' @entity16 ' demonstrates a technique that could potentially be used to achieve nanomanufacturing of devices as they were able to vary the surface concentration of molecules on such short - length scales			1
researchers from the @entity24 have created the ' @entity25 ' on a substrate surface approximately 30 microns in width			1
the image demonstrates a technique that could potentially be used to achieve nano - manufacturing of devices the @entity8 by @entity9 , which is the best known and most parodied painting in the world the famous image was re-created with an atomic force microscope and a process called @entity37 ( @entity38 )			2
going pixel by pixel , scientists at the @entity24 positioned a heated cantilever at the substrate surface to create a series of confined nanoscale chemical reactions			1
by varying only the heat at each location , phd candidate @entity46 controlled the number of new molecules that were created - the greater the heat , the greater the local concentration			1
more heat produced the lighter shades of grey , as seen on the @entity25 's forehead and hands			1
less heat produced the darker shades in her dress and hair , which can be seen when the molecular canvas is visualised using fluorescent dye			0
each pixel is spaced by 125 nanometers			0
@entity66 , an associate professor in the @entity67 and lead author of the study that was published in journal @entity71 , said : ' by tuning the temperature , our team manipulated chemical reactions to yield variations in the molecular concentrations on the nanoscale			2
' the spatial confinement of these reactions provides the precision required to generate complex chemical images like the @entity25			2
' the famous image was re-created with an atomic force microscope ( pictured ) and a process called @entity37 ( @entity38 )			0
going pixel by pixel , scientists positioned a heated cantilever at the substrate surface to create a series of confined nanoscale chemical reactions production of chemical concentration gradients and variations on the sub-micrometre scale are difficult to achieve with other techniques			1
the scientists produced chemical gradients of amine groups , but expect the process could be extended for use with other materials			0
professor @entity104 said : " we envision @entity38 will be capable of patterning gradients of other physical or chemical properties , such as conductivity of graphene			0
professor @entity104 ( pictured ) said technique should enable a wide range of previously inaccessible experiments and applications in fields as diverse as nanoelectronics , optoelectronics and bioengineering ' this technique should enable a wide range of previously inaccessible experiments and applications in fields as diverse as nanoelectronics , optoelectronics and bioengineering			0
' she said another advantage is that atomic force microscopes are fairly common and the thermal control is relatively straightforward , making the approach accessible to both academic and industrial laboratories			0
to facilitate their vision of nano - manufacturing devices with @entity38 , the @entity24 team has recently integrated nanoarrays of five thermal cantilevers to accelerate the pace of production			2
because the technique provides high spatial resolutions at a speed faster than other existing methods , even with a single cantilever , professor @entity104 is hopeful that @entity38 will provide the option of nanoscale printing integrated with the fabrication of large quantities of surfaces and everyday materials , whose dimensions are more than one billion times larger than the @entity38 features themselves .			0
