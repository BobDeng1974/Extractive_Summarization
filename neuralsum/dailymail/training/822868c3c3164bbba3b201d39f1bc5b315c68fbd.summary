by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 08:47 est , 25 january 2014 @entity2 are considering a £ 23million offer for @entity5 left - back @entity4 following the completion of @entity8 's £ 37m move from @entity9			1
a bid is set to go in over the weekend as @entity2 look to beat @entity9 to the 18 - year - old 's signature			1
the deal for @entity8 is set to break their record transfer fee , £ 30.75million paid for @entity16 in 2008 , but @entity17 is hungry for more before the window shuts on january 31			2
bidding wars : @entity4 is being targeted by a number of top clubs , but @entity2 may move first operator : @entity17 is moving quickly to turn around what has been a miserable campaign so far @entity2 are stepping up their efforts for @entity4 as they foresee @entity9 making an offer for the @entity5 man in the summer			1
@entity4 has played 44 times in the @entity29 for @entity5 , and is yet to be capped by @entity30 due to competition from @entity32 and @entity33 left - back @entity34			1
both @entity2 and @entity9 need long - term options at left - back , with some questions over the future of the @entity40 ' @entity39 , 31 , and @entity30 international @entity32 , 33			1
@entity39 is in the final five months of his contract , and @entity17 is already looking ahead for his replacement sooner rather than later			0
substitution : @entity39 's contract runs out in five months , but @entity17 may look to get in a replacement now @entity46 has come ? it is thought @entity9 are also looking to replace left - back @entity32 ( right ) in the long - term meanwhile , @entity32 is under pressure and has a fight on his hands to keep his starting place for @entity9 and @entity30 , but the man who is notorious for shunning interviews got his point across in a @entity57 ad last month			2
@entity32 said in the ad : ‘ who you calling done ? you think i ’m done ? i ’m not done			0
‘ i ’ve won seven @entity60 , three @entity29 titles , 105 caps			0
after 13 years at the top , i should be done			0
but i ’m not done			0
@entity64 would most likely use @entity4 straight away in his plans , rather than keep him on the sidelines before @entity39 leaves			0
still young : @entity4 has played 44 times in the @entity29 for @entity68 's @entity5			2

@entity9 have long been linked with a move for @entity4
but @entity2 are preparing to bid for @entity5 *youngster* over the weekend
attention will turn to @entity4 capture after @entity8 completes £ 37m move
