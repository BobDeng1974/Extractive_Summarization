by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 10:26 est , 24 february 2013 tax probe : @entity2 started his first practice session with @entity4 on wednesday amid a media frenzy @entity7 's tax authorities are probing the multi-million pounds deal which brought @entity2 to @entity4 – less than a month after his arrival			1
it comes as the 37 - year - old former @entity12 football captain finally prepares to make his debut against @entity14 today			1
@entity15 , managing director of the richest club in the world , admitted that a ' formal discussion ' was already taking place with @entity7 's ' fiscal administration '			1
this is despite the fact that @entity2 only signed for @entity4 at the end of january , and has barely spent a night in @entity24 since then			1
he has strictly limited his contract to five months , kept his family based in @entity27 , and – most crucially of all – said that he will pay his nominal salary to charity			0
all of this enables both @entity2 and @entity4 to concentrate on making millions from the player 's image rights and other commercial activities , while paying far smaller taxes abroad			1
mr @entity15 said that ' we have already received a lot of requests ' for @entity2 's salary , and that ' we want to cause as little disappointment as possible			0
' he also admitted that @entity4 wanted to keep government charges to a minimum , claiming that ' the largest possible amount ' would go to a children 's charity			0
it was all part of a ' formal discussion that has started with the fiscal authorities ' , said mr @entity15 , who made his comments about @entity2 as he discussed @entity4 's marketing strategy last week			1
it is almost unheard of for the @entity7 treasury to start discussing tax obligations with a foreign national so soon after his arrival			0
' @entity2 : @entity4 talk to the @entity55 , ' was the headline in saturday 's @entity24 newspaper , and others have already expressed anger at what is going on			2
@entity7 's @entity62 government is introducing a top income tax rate of 75 per cent for multi-millionaires , and many believe @entity2 should pay it if he is playing his football in @entity24			1
@entity7 conservative mp @entity68 mocked @entity2 's ' charity ' salary , saying : ' he will be paid less than my parliamentary assistant ! ' be serious ! ' mr @entity68 added : ' i 'd rather receive 50 per cent of a lot than 75 per cent of nothing ! ' @entity4 , and not @entity2 , will eventually pay the £ 700,000 estimated ' wages ' direct to a selected charity			1
both @entity4 and @entity2 are already promoting club shirts , with an adult top featuring the player 's name and number costing almost £ 100			2
@entity2 and his family were given an escort of 20 policemen and 12 plain clothes security men when they finally arrived in @entity24 last week , with the player taking up residence in £ 14,500 - a - night hotel suite close to the @entity106			0
wife @entity81 and their three sons and daughter all spent a week in the 3,475 sq ft @entity110 at the @entity111			0
yet @entity81 and the children were all pictured returning to @entity27 on friday – meaning they will not be in @entity24 if @entity2 makes an appearance for his new team against arch rivals @entity14 in the @entity7 capital tonight			2
@entity4 is ultimately bank - rolled by oil rich @entity117 , which is due to host the @entity120 finals in 2022			0
a spokesman for the @entity7 @entity122 said ' we can not discuss individual cases ' , but confirmed that all ' high - worth ' individuals working in @entity7 would be ' scrutinised '			0
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' @entity2 has given any income he would have earned from @entity4 to charity			2
we have nothing to hide			0

' formal discussion ' has taken place with @entity7 's ' fiscal administration '
