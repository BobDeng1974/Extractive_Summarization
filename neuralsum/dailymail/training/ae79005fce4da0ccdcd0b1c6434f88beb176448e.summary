spectators and photographers heard @entity1 unleash remarks towards the players ' box as last year 's @entity3 champion suffered a mini-meltdown on @entity14 during his straight sets loss			1
the @entity17 no 1 barked ' shut the f * * * up ' and ' five minutes before the f * * * * * * match ' in their direction , and @entity4 claims he sensed all was not right with @entity1 before the game even began			1
@entity1 , watched from the @entity46 by the @entity47 and @entity48 , said in his @entity50 blog that the run - up to the match was as normal as ever			2
' there was nothing different in the build - up and no reason to expect that kind of performance , ' insisted @entity1			2
' the timings changed a bit because we played the quarter - final pretty early compared with some of my other matches , but my routine was the same and i practised with @entity66 both days			1
' i was nervous , i felt the butterflies and was excited about the match , but that 's perfectly normal			0
' i did n't feel overcome by the moment , but i certainly was n't very good when i got out on court			0
' @entity4 , though , had an inkling that @entity1 was in a strange place ahead of the match : ' as soon as we started to warm up i sensed that his game was not at the highest level			1
' the 23 - year - old @entity28 , asked why he felt that way , said : ' it 's just a feeling			0
i have practised quite a few times with him and i know how he is striking the ball when he is at his best			0
' i know how he is playing when he is not at his best			0
i felt something was a little different , and i just had to go with the flow			0
