you might think the origin of the world ’s largest river would be easy to find			0
but scientists have debated where the mighty @entity6 river begins for at least four centuries			2
the confusion has meant that at least five @entity11 rivers have been crowned as the source at some point since the 1600s			0
the @entity15 is a long river running through the central region of @entity11 and marked in red			1
its name means ' great river '			0
scientists now believe this is the source of the @entity6 river now a new study by the @entity24 , argues for yet another origin , according to a report by @entity27 in @entity28			2
using gps tracking data and satellite imagery , researcher @entity29 and his team discovered that the @entity15 is about 10 per cent longer than the @entity33			2
@entity15 , which translates to ‘ great river ’ , runs from northeast to southeast through the @entity34 in the central region of @entity11			1
the researchers , who results have been published in @entity37 , claim that the @entity33 ( pictured ) has wrongly been attributed as its source since 1971 throughout the 1700s , the @entity39 in northern @entity11 was thought to be the @entity6 's source			1
this is because the @entity39 held the largest volume of flowing water compared to other tributaries flowing into the @entity6			0
the @entity45 — a lower extension of the @entity33 — took the crown for a while as it had the longest tributary into the @entity6			2
a @entity28 team established @entity51 as the river 's source in 1971 , the in 2000 , a follow - up @entity28 expedition confirmed @entity56 at the base of @entity51 as the headwaters and the @entity33 as the longest upstream extension of the @entity6			1
the latest study suggests that the @entity15 in @entity11 is the source			1
the researchers , whose results have been published in @entity37 , claim that the @entity33 has wrongly been attributed as its source since 1971			1
if they 're right , the discovery would add 47 to 57 miles ( 75 to 92km ) to the length of the @entity6 , which currently measures 4,000 miles ( 6,437km )			1
but whether scientists accept their results will be based on their definition of a river ’s source			0
the source of the @entity6 could be defined as the most distant point in the drainage basin from which surface water ran year round			0
but it could also be the furthest point from which water could possibly flow to the @entity77			0
some geologists argue that the @entity15 ca n’t be the @entity6 ’s source as it runs dry for five months of the year			1
flowing water is the important in determining the true source of a river , said @entity81 , the geographer at @entity28			0
scientists have debated where the mighty @entity6 begins for at least four centuries			0
the confusion has meant that at least five @entity11 rivers have been crowned as the source at some point since the 1600s throughout the 1700s , the @entity39 in northern @entity11 was thought to be the @entity6 's source			1
this is because the @entity39 held the largest volume of flowing water compared to other tributaries flowing into the @entity6			0
the @entity45 — a lower extension of the @entity33 — took the crown for a while too s it had the longest tributary into the @entity6			2
a @entity28 team established @entity51 as the river 's source in 1971 , then in 2000 , a follow - up @entity28 expedition confirmed @entity56 at the base of @entity51 as the headwaters and the @entity33 as the longest upstream extension of the @entity6			1
so while the latest study can provide a new angle , the mystery about the source of the @entity6 remains far from decided			0
in 2000 , a follow - up @entity28 expedition confirmed @entity56 ( pictured ) at the base of @entity51 as the headwaters and the @entity33 as the longest upstream extension of the @entity6			2

scientists believe source is the @entity15 , which runs through @entity11
if they 're right , it could between 75km to 92km to the length of the @entity6
the researchers , who results have been published in @entity37 , claim that the @entity33 has wrongly been attributed as its source since 1971
