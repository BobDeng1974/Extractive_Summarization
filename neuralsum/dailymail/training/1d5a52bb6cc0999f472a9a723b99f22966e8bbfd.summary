@entity0 cancelled her bridal shower at the hotel last month , after the @entity3 introduced @entity5 law calling for gays to be stoned now , she joins the likes of @entity8 and @entity9 hitting out at the @entity11 boycott of the revered 102 - year - old retreat reality star claims the loss of business ' does n't even make a dent in the @entity18 's fortunes ' refuses to punish ' hard - working ' staff that she has known since she was a little girl @entity0 has become the latest celebrity to speak out against the @entity11 boycott that has crippled the business of the @entity26			1
the hotel is said to have been almost empty in recent months after its owner , the @entity3 @entity29 , introduced @entity5 law in the @entity32 state , which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death			1
in a lengthy post on her website , @entity0 , 33 , has confessed that after originally supporting the protest - including cancelling her planned bridal shower at the hotel last month - she has now had a change of heart			1
' for a sultan that has 20 billion dollars , this loss of business does n’t even make a dent in his fortunes , ' @entity0 writes , in a blog most titled ' my thoughts '			1
' but the hotel staff are being negatively affected every day with the boycott that has gone on for weeks now			2
' boycott : the hotel is said to have been almost empty in recent weeks after its owner , the @entity3 , introduced @entity5 law in his country , which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death joining forces : @entity8 has also spoken out against the ban she added : ' we should n’t punish the amazing hard - working people who have been so good to us for years ! when i was a little girl , i would ride my bike to the @entity26 on the weekends to eat downstairs in the coffee shop with my dad ( her lawyer father , @entity88 ) '			1
@entity0 even revealed that during her pregnancy with daughter @entity91 , she had befriended a waitress at the hotel who was also with child , and were both due just a few weeks apart			2
' we would always share our pregnancy stories with each other			0
i know for a fact she has a new baby at home that she has to feed , so this boycott is affecting her tremendously , ' she remembered			2
@entity0 had been part of a growing number of stars , including @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 who have boycotted the @entity111 hotels - including the revered 102 - year - old retreat - in protest at the law			1
now , the reality star has joined the likes of @entity8 and @entity9 who have hit back at the ban by celebrities			1
last month , @entity8 wrote on @entity119 that did n't agree with the boycott as it hits hard - working staff he considers his ' friends '			1
still showing support : @entity0 , pictured today in @entity125 , has revealed that she no longer supports the @entity11 ban of the @entity26 anti-protest : charmed actress @entity9 pictured last month , hosting a reception ' take back the @entity128 ' in support of the hotel 's staff meanwhile , @entity132 actress @entity9 decided to hold a ' gay - in ' cocktail party at the hotel , rather than boycott it			1
she wrote : ' i want to assemble a group of men and women ( and hopefully some adulteresses , ) that would be stoned in @entity3 but that will be welcome at the @entity141 , ' @entity0 also made clear in her post that the ' unjust treatment and violation of rights of the lgbt community around the world is never justified and i will continue to proudly support the lgbt community in every way imaginable			1
' meanwhile , the hotel is said to have promised to guarantee the jobs , income , gratuities , and benefits of all of its employees following the international backlash against the @entity3 ’s horrific new laws			2
my thoughts my best friend @entity161 and i wanted to take our babies out to lunch a few days ago after our baby class but there were so many paparazzi swarming us , it would have really scared them			0
instead we had to feed them at her place and put them down for a nap			0
we were planning on taking them to the @entity26 , which is where we always go because they respect not having any paparazzi drive onto their property , but i reminded @entity161 that my bridal shower was moved from that hotel due to the actions of the @entity3			1
@entity161 shared with me her view on the situation and we 100 % agree that the actions and law enforcements of the @entity18 are completely against everything we believe @entity186 , i started to realize that maybe boycotting the hotel is n’t the best solution either			2
for a sultan that has 20 billion dollars , this loss of business does n’t even make a dent in his fortunes			2
but the hotel staff are being negatively affected every day with the boycott that has gone on for weeks now … we should n’t punish the amazing hard - working people who have been so good to us for years ! when i was a little girl , i would ride my bike to the @entity26 on the weekends to eat downstairs in the coffee shop with my dad , and some of the same people still work there ! it ’s sad to see them suffering from this @entity205 must be other ways to express our views without punishing the workers , some who i know personally have families at home and depend on the city ’s business and tips to survive			1
when i was pregnant , the hotel was my safe haven			0
there ’s one waitress that works downstairs who was also pregnant at the same time as me and due just a few weeks apart			0
we would always share our pregnancy stories with each other			0
i know for a fact she has a new baby at home that she has to feed , so this boycott is affecting her tremendously			0
the hotel is a piece of @entity232 ’s history as well as many of our own personal @entity234 support @entity9 and @entity8 ’s takes on this matter			2
the unjust treatment and violation of rights of the lgbt community around the world is never justified and i will continue to proudly support the lgbt community in every way imaginable			0
i do believe though that instead of this boycott , there has to be another solution			0
i ’m glad to hear that industry executives like @entity247 and @entity248 are reaching out to leaders of the hotel chain to discuss a way to potentially end the protest			0
i hope we can come together and stand up for our beliefs while still making sure good people are n’t wrongfully hurt in the process			0
boycotting the hotel wo n’t affect the sultan , just our dear friends who work there			0
for every warm smile when they greet us and for all the dedication they put in to make our experiences more enjoyable , i hope we can return the same love and compassion to make sure they ’re not forgotten during this protest			0
