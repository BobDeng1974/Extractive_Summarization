a minuscule apartment , only 86 foot square , may not sound like an enticing place to live , but this particular teeny weeny flat in @entity4 has been transformed into an enchanting foldaway living space			1
hidden behind the cupboard doors is a secret bed , wardrobe , table and chairs , bookcase , bathroom and kitchen			1
the flat at the top of one of @entity4 's @entity18 buildings was historically a maid 's quarters but was more recently used as a storage room			1
to create the transformation , they enlisted the help of architects @entity48 and @entity50 from @entity52 architectural firm			1
' despite the small area , the space had to be functional in order to sleep , and also to cook , eat , wash , work and store a maximum of items , ' said @entity48			2
the firm came up with the concept of a room that works like a @entity25 knife			2

hidden within the compact space is a bed , a table , a wardrobe , a staircase , a micro fridge , microwave , a toilet , shower , bookcase , hidden sink and removable cooking plate			1
all the amenities are fully integrated and can be closed away when no longer in use			0
once all the elements are folded and stored , it frees up half of the area of the room			0

the kitchen sink can be covered and the apartment also has a mini fridge , microwave and removable cooking plate the architects were also inspired by @entity119 apartment design			1
' it 's really efficient in small spaces , ' @entity50 explains			0
' the biggest challenge was first to fit a full - size bed in such a small room - then finding the correct position for it			0
fitting a bathroom with all the necessary amenities was also quite a challenge			0
after that , all the other parts of the design started to be obvious			0
' but despite those challenges , @entity48 says the hardest part of the project was convincing the clients to go ahead with it			2
' the space was hard to understand on the 3d images , ' she admits			0
once the work was finished , the wall stickers helped transform the space from a utilitarian cupboard into something a little more enchanting .			0
