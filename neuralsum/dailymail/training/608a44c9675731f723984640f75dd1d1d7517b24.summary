it was the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle and a home to raise their young son that led @entity6 and @entity7 from @entity8 to @entity9 at the turn of the millennium			1
and when they set eyes on @entity15 – with its sweeping tree - lined approach , castle - like entrance and magnificent halls – they knew immediately they ’d found the perfect place for them			1
the house is set in 100 acres of deer , fox and pheasant - laden woods near the town of @entity28 – and has access to an abundance of sea trout and salmon in the @entity33			1
captivating gome : @entity6 and @entity7 transformed former prison @entity15 near @entity28 in @entity9 into a £ 2.62million pound estate with 13 bedrooms and five cottages but the tranquil estate also has an intriguing past : one of its former uses was as an open prison			1
in the early 1950s the @entity44 bought @entity45			1
it could hold 85 prisoners and many of them would work on the estate and in its garden centre , which was open to the public and sold local produce			1
some of the inmates , who were considered no danger to the public , travelled outside for work as part of their rehabilitation			0
but by the late 1990s the prison was operating well below capacity , and it closed due to budget cuts in 2000			1
when the @entity64 took it over , they turned much of the estate into a different kind of rehabilitation centre – a retreat offering a variety of courses to improve people ’s emotional and physical health			0
@entity6 , who started his own building company when he was just 18 , previously ran two restaurants and an alternative health clinic in @entity8			1
as well as the health retreat and a cooking school , @entity6 and @entity7 have turned @entity15 into a sumptuous family home			1
away from the main house , the property also includes cottages and stables and there is planning permission for a pool and leisure complex			0
@entity45 ’s history goes right to the heart of @entity9 ’s heraldic ancestry			1
the land ownership can be traced back to the monarchic @entity94 dynasty , through the tumultuous period of @entity96 and the reign of @entity98 , and into the industrial age and beyond			0
transformation : as a jail , @entity45 could hold 85 prisoners and many of them would work on the estate and in its garden centre , but closed due to budget cuts in 2000 , when the @entity64 's bought it the striking @entity107 facade , built in 1869 , melds into a property dating from the early @entity109 which was once owned by the @entity111 ’s family			1
the last @entity111 to own the estate was @entity94 , the 7th @entity111 , who was a @entity113 to @entity114 in 1825 it was bought by @entity117 mp @entity116 , who made his fortune from plantations in the @entity120			1
at its largest , the @entity121 comprised 37,000 acres , with 40 farms and 30 full - time staff			0
the house , which is 46 miles from @entity125 and 76 from @entity126 , was used as a hospital during the @entity128 , after which it returned to use as a private home			0
in the early 1920s , when it was the home of mill owner @entity133 , the estate was recorded as covering 18,000 acres			2
@entity6 ’s knowledge of the history of the building was added to by a real - life account of the @entity133 era , after an elderly former servant asked to visit			2
@entity141 owner : portrait of @entity94 , 7th @entity111 , the last of his line to own @entity15 @entity6 says : ‘ the lady worked as a housemaid and remembered fondly the large parties and dinners during that period , and that @entity133 dressed formally each evening and ate in the large dining room			1
’ the renovation work was a labour of love			0
@entity6 says : ‘ the oak staircase and all of the imported pitch pine floors were stripped back and oiled			2
each of the 88 windows was given individual attention			0
' we invested in a new heating system and did major work on the electrics and even added a gym studio			0
’ the house now has grandiose formal rooms adorned with a spectacular array of fine art , collectable antiques and wood - burning fireplaces			0
the couple also installed a contemporary kitchen and living area they call @entity174 , which is inspired by @entity7 ’s roots			2
and they obviously run deep : the couple are selling because they are moving to @entity174 to be closer to her family			0
‘ the house has served us well , ’ says @entity6			2
‘ when we came to @entity45 we were given a very good welcome to the area by the neighbours and people in the community			0
’ he does not fish , shoot or hunt ; however , he says @entity45 is perfect for those with a passion for the great outdoors			0
another draw is @entity45 ’s proximity to some of the world ’s best golf courses , such as @entity199 and @entity200			0
at the front of the property there is a helipad that doubles as a bowling green – and @entity6 says : ‘ we ’ve had friends who ’ve flown to @entity8 by helicopter			2
’ as well as 13 bedrooms , the house comes with ten bathrooms and five reception rooms			1
the official valuation of the property – which @entity9 law insists upon – has set the minimum price for offers for the house alone at £ 1.5 million			1
five other properties on the estate are for sale , with minimum prices ranging from £ 220,000 to £ 350,000			2
for the whole estate , offers over £ 2.62 million will be considered			0
