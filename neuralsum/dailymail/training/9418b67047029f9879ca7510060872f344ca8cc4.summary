@entity0 , 35 , from @entity1 in @entity12 , was tucking into a large @entity3 pizza from the takeaway when he felt something hard dig into his gum			1
he claims that to his disgust he pulled out an inch - long grisly black claw from his mouth			1
bosses at the popular pizza takeaway franchise have said they are investigating the incident			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i initially thought it was a burnt piece			1
it stuck into my gum			2
' when i pulled it out i saw it and it was this claw with gristle around the knuckle			2
' i initially wanted to throw up			0
it was the last piece of that half of the pizza			2
' it was not really solid because it had been baked			0
it could have hooked into someone 's throat			2
it could quite easily have been swallowed and got jammed			0
' he said that he and his wife ordered two large pizzas , garlic bread , potato wedges and a bottle of @entity46 from their local @entity4 's branch in @entity48 , costing Â£ 22.99			1
after finding the claw mr @entity0 said he immediately rang the local branch , who he has ordered from many times the past , to complain			1
he said : ' i got straight on the phone to the @entity54			0
their immediate response was to say they were sorry and that they would send another pizza			2
' i said " no i do not want another pizza			2
" at that point i was still in shock			0
' the branch told mr @entity0 they would send a driver over to collect the offending claw and the remaining uneaten pizza			1
after being ignored for an hour and a half , mr @entity0 said he called the branch back at 9pm to find out what was happening			1
mr @entity0 said : ' an hour and a half later there was still no driver			1
i phoned back to ask what was going on and said i want a refund			0
the mystery claw mr @entity0 claims to have found in his @entity4 's pizza - he says he could have choked bosses at the popular pizza takeaway have said they have launched an investigation into the incident ' i got on the phone with a girl called @entity82 and i was chatting to her and she said they would give us a refund and that they would send out the van			1
' but after the van not turning up and initially receiving no response to his complaint from the pizza company he resorted to posting a rant on the @entity97 @entity96 facebook page			2
it read : ' the pizza arrived promptly , but whilst eating i experienced a sharp pain and found myself half choking whilst chewing a mouthful of pizza that had chicken tikka on it			1
' i continued to pull a solid chunk out of my mouth and to my horror found i 'd been chewing on a chicken claw ! ? ! ? ' ' with something as serious as this i was amazed that it was n't dealt with as a priority , it appears that your company prefers to continue sending out drivers for more profit than worrying about sharp objects being put in your pizzas ! ' i was promised there would be a driver sent out immediately and would be with us within 10 minutes			1
' mr @entity0 added : ' when the driver turned up he said " that 's not nice "			1
' i said " i was chewing on that mate			0
" it was n't his fault though			0
he took it away and that was the end of it			0

' mr @entity0 and his wife had ordered the pizza from their local @entity4 's in @entity48 ( pictured ) as the couple had paid for their @entity4 's takeout meal on january 16 through @entity138 the branch said they would receive a refund in the next 3 - 5 working days			1
however the following thursday they had still received no refund and the manager of the @entity142 's called mr @entity0 up to tell him they could not give him the refund and he would have to email the head office			1
having not received any email back from @entity4 's head office , @entity0 took matters into his own hands and took to @entity149 again to share his nightmare takeout			1
it read : ' why could n't your own staff contact you themselves and get this sorted ! ? and even worse , having emailed that address with my complaint on thursday , it is now the following monday and still nobody has got back to me ? ! ? ! ! ' since posting the rant on @entity4 's @entity96 facebook page the disturbing picture of the claw has been shared nearly 400 times			1
mr @entity0 said he has contacted @entity166 about the claw to see if they could help mr @entity0 said today : ' i stuck it on @entity149 to see if i got any response			1
i got one response from them asking if i had a reference number			0
' ' i replied that i had been fobbed off by the branch to email them			2
someone must know about it but i have n't heard anything back since			0
' mr @entity0 said he has contacted @entity166 to see what they could do to help			1
he said : ' the girl i spoke to was horrified herself			0
she did say it was hard to tell from pictures what it is			2
' she said it is hard to tell if it is a chicken claw although a couple of people on facebook were saying it could be a dog claw			1
' it is very difficult for them to do anything without the claw itself to analyse			2
' she is going to try to get hold of the area manager to see if there has been any investigation or record into it			2
' he added : ' @entity200 knows how it got in there			0
possible someone was just trying to pump the pizzas out without looking			0
' but how it got in the pizza i do n't know			2
the environmental health lady said it could be from the supplier but how did the claw get there is beyond me			0
' the whole thing is ridiculous			0
i will never eat there again , that 's for sure			0
' in a statement a spokesperson for @entity97 said : ' the safety of our food is of upmost priority for @entity4 's and we have strict processes and procedures in place for handling all ingredients and pizzas			1

' just two days ago @entity233 reported how a disgusted university student was left with a foul taste in her mouth after taking a bite into her @entity4 's pepperoni pizza and finding a fingernail			1
@entity240 , 20 , was having a night in with her housemates enjoying films and a takeaway when she heard a crunch and realised she had bit into the yellowed nail , which was baked into the crust			0
the third year @entity249 student offered the rest of the slice to a friend who was more than happy to finish it and the unfazed miss @entity240 continued to eat the remainder			0
