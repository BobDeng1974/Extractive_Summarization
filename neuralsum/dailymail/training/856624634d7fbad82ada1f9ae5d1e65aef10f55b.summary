we were appalled to be told our children could n’t take in packed lunches and further incensed with how the school have dealt with the situation			1
' we like our kids to have a packed lunch because , not only does it save us money , but it also allows you to let your children eat what they like			1

@entity6 in @entity34 wrote to parents with policy
rules championed by @entity183 now force schools to provide meals
*father* @entity20 , 31 , has *unsuccessfully* protested over the move
he has taken three children out of school and moved them elsewhere
claims packed lunches allow parents to ' let children eat what they like '
other parents say £ 1.75 - a - day charge is ' awful lot of money ' over a year
@entity6 says its helping ' healthy eating ' and 97 *%* of parents are in favour
but six children from three families have now been removed from school
