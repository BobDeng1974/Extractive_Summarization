@entity0 spins daily rhetoric about helping the job market recover from the recession , but now he 's come up with a rather more practical approach to helping one woman 's husband get work			1
the president last night asked a video chat questioner to send him her husband 's cv , insisting he wanted to find out why the man has been out of work despite his skills as a semiconductor engineer			1
he told mother - of - two @entity17 , 29 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , that he believed such high - tech fields are in great demand and her 40 - year - old husband ‘ should be able to find something right away ’			1
but mrs @entity17 told president @entity0 that despite what he said , her husband had been out of work for three years			1
she wanted to know why foreign workers were getting visas for high - skilled work			2
@entity17 describes herself as a ' good @entity46 ' and revealed she did n't vote for president @entity0 four years ago			1
but she has been ' so disappointed ' with the latest race for the @entity48 that she does n't expect to back the @entity46 this time			0
' i have n't seen anybody who would have been a good replacement , ' she told the @entity52			0
' i know how @entity0 is now			1
i know how he rolls			0
so i 'd probably vote him back in			0
' mrs @entity17 works in insurance for @entity54			1
her husband meanwhile was employed by @entity55 for seven years until he lost his job			1
the exchange came as the president appeared in a live video chat room known as a ‘ hangout ’ , part of @entity63 's social networking site @entity33			1
he was answering questions submitted via @entity65 , as well as interacting live with mrs @entity17 and four others			1
the post-state of the @entity69 session was part of the @entity48 focus on social media			0
in past such events - with @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity65 sessions following previous @entity79 addresses - president @entity0 answered questions submitted via online networks			2
but monday 's event allowed him to interact with a selection of his questioners , leading to more substantive exchanges as they pushed him on his stances			2
query : he told @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 , pictured , that what he was hearing from industry suggested high - tech fields are in great demand and her husband ' should be able to find something right away ' family : mrs @entity17 , left , is pictured in her @entity33 profile photo with her unemployed husband , right mrs @entity17 's insistence that the president 's claims about the demand for high - skilled workers were n't being born out for her husband led to the offer to take a look at his resume			1
‘ i 'll have to take you up on that , ’ she told him			0
and president @entity0 came back to it after covering a range of issues in the 45 - minute session , telling her : ‘ remember to send me that information ! ’ ' i meant what i said , if you send me your husband 's resume , i 'd be interested in finding out exactly what 's happening right there ' president @entity0 on resumes president @entity0 got a variety of questions on the economy and his policies on innovation and small businesses			1
an unemployed occupy protester sent a video asking him : ‘ i need help			2
what am i going to do ? ’ ‘ the most important thing i can do for folks who are out of work right now is grow the economy , ’ president @entity0 responded in part			1
he also said unmanned drone strikes were being used justly			0
‘ i think that there 's a perception somehow that we 're just sending in a whole bunch of strikes willy - nilly , ’ he said			2
‘ this is a targeted , focussed effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists			0
’ he was also asked about online piracy			0
@entity147 recently delayed action on legislation cracking down on online piracy after opposition from internet companies including @entity63			0
contenders : the exchanges came a day ahead of the key @entity46 primary in @entity156 today , as @entity46 presidential hopefuls - especially @entity158 , left and @entity159 , right - attack president @entity0 daily president @entity0 said he thought it was possible to protect intellectual property that creates jobs in the @entity164 , while still respecting the integrity of the internet as an open system			2
the exchanges came a day ahead of the key @entity46 primary in @entity156 today , as @entity46 presidential hopefuls - especially @entity158 and @entity159 - attack president @entity0 daily			2
' the most important thing i can do for folks who are out of work right now is grow the economy ' president @entity0 on jobs but none of the questions put to him were about the presidential race			1
they were about the @entity79 and people 's lives now			2
there were also light moments , as mrs @entity17 asked president @entity0 if he would show off his dance moves			1
he refused and said his wife , first lady @entity183 , mocks his dancing			0
another questioner asked how they plan to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary in autumn			0
but as it 's shortly before the election , president @entity0 said he was n't sure how romantic it would be			1
more than 133,000 questions were submitted and voted on by @entity65 users			0
@entity63 officials selected the questions to ask based in part on those results			0
some 1,630,870 votes were cast			0
although many of the questions that appeared online were about @entity0 's stance on legalising marijuana - something he has said he opposes when asked in the past - that did not come up			1
interest : the number one voted question was about the potential extradition to the @entity164 of @entity206 , a young @entity208 student accused of breaking copyright laws			2
he is pictured with his mother @entity211 this month organisers said the number one voted question was about the potential extradition to the @entity164 of @entity206 , a young @entity208 student accused of breaking online copyright laws			0
the 23 - year - old is accused of creating a website from his university bedroom in @entity219 , @entity220 , which listed sites where films could be downloaded in infringement of copyright			0
' i think that there 's a perception somehow that we 're just sending in a whole bunch of strikes willy - nilly			0
this is a targeted , focussed effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists ' president @entity0 on drones his lawyers say this in itself is not an offence under @entity208 law but earlier this month a court cleared him for extradition to the @entity164 , where he could face ten years in a high - security prison			1
president @entity0 said he was n't personally involved in the case but the administration wanted to ensure that intellectual property is protected ‘ in a way that 's consistent with internet freedom ’			1
the student ’s mother @entity250 said the @entity164 has ‘ excessive use of the extradition laws between our countries ’ and the ‘ @entity208 government ’s passive acceptance ’ of this is ‘ shameful ’			0
‘ it ’s up to mr @entity0 to put a stop to the ridiculous and appallingly harsh attempts to extradite @entity206 and others facing similarly unnecessary treatment , ’ ms @entity250 added			2
the @entity250 case has chilling similarities to that of @entity270 ’s sufferer @entity268 , who hacked into @entity272 computers from his @entity274 bedroom while searching for evidence of aliens			0

@entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 , posed question on live video chat
