by @entity0 cancer patients are being forced to wait too long for urgent treatment because the @entity3 is under ‘ huge strain ’ , warn campaigners			1
official figures show that waiting - time targets have been missed for the first time since they were introduced five years ago			1
the targets state that patients with cancer must not wait longer than two months from when their gp refers them urgently to a specialist to the start of their treatment			1
' huge strain ' on the @entity3 means that cancer patients are having to wait too long for urgent treatments , campaigners have warned for the first time since 2009 the overall target of 85 per cent of patients starting treatment within the 62 days has not been met			1
@entity23 figures show that in some hospitals only six in ten patients were seen within 62 days in the period from january to march			1
sixty of approximately 180 hospital trusts in @entity29 failed to hit the 85 per cent target in the final quarter of 2013/14			2
the average slipped to 84.4 per cent during the period january to march , down from 85.8 per cent during the previous quarter			0
figures were worse for patients with lung cancer , urological cancers and gastrointestinal cancers than for those with breast cancer or skin cancer			2
@entity41 , director of policy and research at the charity @entity44 , said : ‘ it is of great concern that the number of trusts missing this target has doubled over the last year			0
around one in four of the trusts that were hitting the target at the start of 2013/14 are now missing the target			0
‘ this is the first breach of any cancer waiting time in @entity29 since 2009 and is a clear warning sign that the @entity3 is under huge strain			1
‘ the @entity60 already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in @entity62			0
more patients are now facing delays , which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk			0
we ’re very worried that the co-ordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new @entity3			2
the missed - target figures are worse for patients with lung cancer , urological cancers and gastrointestinal cancers than for those with breast cancer ( pictured ) or skin cancer ‘ the number of cancer patients is set to increase from two to three million by 2020			1
we ca n’t afford to see more and more people waiting longer			0
’ @entity82 , national clinical director for @entity84 for @entity29 , said work must be done to make sure standards are met			0
‘ latest figures show nationally the @entity3 has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards , ’ he said			1
‘ but there is variation in meeting the challenging standards , and national performance against one of the targets has dipped			0
commissioners are working with local providers where the standard is not being met to identify the issues to ensure patients are treated in a timely way			0
’ the @entity23 said : ‘ the @entity3 is treating more cancer patients than ever			1
since 2009 , we ’ve seen the number rise by 15 per cent			0
‘ we want the @entity3 to have the very best cancer services in the world , and are investing £ 750 million to support early diagnosis and access to treatment			2

@entity3 must treat 85 **%** of cancer patients within 62 days of referral by @entity112
but new figures show these waiting time targets are now being missed
in some hospitals only 60 **%** of patients are seen within the *timeframe*
