virtual reality , drones and data centers are behind a massive hiring spree at @entity4 set to swell its ranks as much as 14 per cent , according to a review of job listings on the company 's website			1
the social networking company aims to add nearly 1,200 new employees , the outgrowth of aggressive investments that executives have said will define the coming year			2
@entity15 , the maker of virtual reality headsets that @entity4 acquired in a $ 2billion deal last year , is among the key areas slated for growth , with 54 jobs listed on its website			1
coo @entity27 , right , said the hiring spree is because of ' ambitious ' ceo @entity29 @entity4 had 8,348 full - time employees at the end of september , far fewer than @entity33 's roughly 55,000 employees or @entity34 's roughly 127,000 ( @entity34 announced in the summer that it plans to cut 18,000 jobs )			1
at the same time , @entity4 gets more out of each employee , according to calculations using company revenue figures			2

that efficiency has helped @entity4 enjoy rich profit margins			2
among the roles that @entity4 needs to fill for the @entity46 business are managers to oversee logistics , procurement and global supply chain planning - a sign , some analysts say , that the product is nearing its commercial release			1
the hiring spree is likely to bring with it bumper salaries - it was recently revealed that even entry - level engineers at the company earn $ 106,000			0
the market for virtual reality headsets is still nascent			0
but if virtual reality takes off for entertainment , gaming , communications or computing , @entity4 could be at the center of the new platform with @entity46			2

' our users are growing and our business is growing and we want to support that , ' she said , noting that @entity4 's business is much more expansive today than a few years ago , with offices throughout the world			0
the jobs run a gamut from sales people to software engineers for @entity4 's 1.35 - billion - member social network			0

that efficiency has helped @entity4 enjoy rich profit margins			0
and the company 's relatively small headcount provides an important talking point in the battle to attract the most talented computer programmers			0
@entity4 has long touted to potential recruits their ability to work directly on products used by hundreds of millions of people , a marked contrast to some larger tech companies			0
' we 're growing as fast as we can , where the " can " part is really a factor of how many people we can absorb while maintaining a strong culture , ' @entity143 , an engineering manager who runs @entity4 's @entity145 office , told @entity152 at one of the company 's famed ' @entity155 ' events last week			1

@entity4 currently has more than 400 employees in @entity145 , and is looking for a larger site close to the center of the city that could hold as many as 2,000 people , according to a person familiar with the matter			2

@entity180 , the online advertising technology that @entity4 acquired in 2013 , is another big area of hiring , with more than 20 open positions listed			2
