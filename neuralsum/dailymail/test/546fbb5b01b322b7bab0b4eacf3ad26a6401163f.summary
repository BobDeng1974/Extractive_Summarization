@entity0 will take on @entity2 knockout artist @entity1 for the interim @entity4 world title after @entity5 pulled out of their april 18 date			1
@entity5 has been elevated to ‘ champion in recess ’ with @entity8 declared the full champion of the lightweight division			2
@entity5 was initially forced to withdraw from his title defence against @entity0 in march after coming down with dengue fever from a mosquito bite and he withdrew again this week as he is still reeling from the after - effects of the virus that has left him unable to train			1
@entity18 's @entity0 ( left ) will go head - to - head with @entity1 for the interim @entity4 world title @entity20 was set to fight @entity21 @entity4 champion @entity5 but will instead face @entity1 on the april 18 date @entity0 expressed his disappointment at losing out on a title shot with @entity5 , who was twice forced to withdraw through illness @entity25 , a frightening puncher from @entity26 , has recorded 16 knockouts from 17 wins in his 19 fights ( two draws ) , with 11 quick wins coming inside the first three rounds			1
although @entity18 ace @entity0 is disappointed that he wo n't be facing the champion @entity5 for the belt , the main consolation for him is that he will still challenge for a version of the world title			1
and @entity0 believes that his higher level of experience : 48 fights over 15 years ; 18 championship title fights ; 264 career rounds and 20 knockouts from 37 wins , vastly outweighs @entity1 ’s and will give him the vital edge over the @entity46 hitman			1
‘ it ’s unfortunate that @entity5 ’s pulled out again , but things in life happen for a reason and i ’m delighted to still be fighting for a version of the @entity4 world title and i ’m headlining the @entity53 in front of my home fans , ’ he said			1
in his absence @entity4 lightweight champion @entity5 ( right ) has been elevated to ‘ champion in recess ’ ‘ i ’ve seen some footage of him , he ’s strong , with big right hands and left hooks and and can take you clean out , but i ’m not going to be in a position to let him do that to me			2
‘ @entity1 ’s a very dangerous fighter and a massive , massive , puncher			0
just look at his record , he ’s banging people out left , right and centre and it makes frightening reading , but when i saw it i said straight away i ’ll have this guy because i know that i can beat him			0
‘ i ’ve been in this sport for over ten years ; i ’ve had more knockouts than he ’s had fights ; twice as many fights as him , and three times as many championship fights , in terms of experience he ’s not on my level and i can use all of my experience to my advantage			0
‘ even with the change of opponent at this stage , plus the change from @entity5 ’s orthodox style to @entity90 ’s southpaw style , we still have some time to study him and my trainer @entity91 is confident we can come up with the plan to beat him			2
i ’ll beat anyone at the moment with the way i ’m feeling			0
‘ i ’m in with a massive puncher , but i can punch a bit myself so the crowd will be in for an exciting fight and i can see me flattening him			0
if the opportunity comes to take him out early i ’ll take it , but i know i ’ve got to be smart in there			0
