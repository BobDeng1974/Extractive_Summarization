from lovely lace at @entity3 to dripping diamonds at @entity5 , the @entity1 haute couture shows are the stuff of fashion dreams			1
the garments , some of which require 300 hours of work , are crafted with the red carpet in mind and are so bespoke that they do n't even come with a price tag because if you 're lucky enough to snap one up , budget is of no relevance			0
the @entity19 haute couture catwalks served up the boldest and most forward - thinking designs the city has seen in a good few years ; haute is all about making a statement after all ( even if no one buys the clothes )			1
@entity26 rounds up the most glamorous moments the week had to offer			1
@entity26 rounds up the most lavish moments of @entity1 haute couture week , starting with @entity3 's runway , which was transformed into a paper jungle and watched by the likes of @entity33 and @entity34 it makes sense to start with @entity3 , which has become one of the most talked - about , anticipated and well - attended shows in haute couture history			1
watched from the front row by @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity43 , @entity41 sent his models - including @entity45 - down the beautifully ornate runway in tulle , thousand - colour boucle and crystal flower embellished everything			1
clearly a key theme in the paper jungle show , flowers featured prominently and hair maestro @entity53 's hair decorations , which hung from each girl 's low plait , trended on social media			0
@entity41 - the @entity57 of couture - unveiled crop tops and lavish skirts embellished with thousands of ornate floral sequins and tulle , as modelled by his new muse , @entity45 , right giving the @entity3 showspace a run for its money was @entity65 's haute couture show , which was held across two levels			1
adding to the drama , the upper deck was supported by white scaffolding so that the clatter of the models ' shoes added to the general ambiance of the show			0
there were printed catsuits , ballerina dresses and plenty of sequins , as well as knitted minidresses , crop tops and stripes in abundance			0
perhaps the most talked - about item on the catwalk was the latex legging boots in bold , primary colours and ankle boots with @entity91 heels			2
over at @entity93 was a whole different story			0
the @entity97 - based @entity96 fashion designer , who is loved by @entity98 and @entity99 , sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns			2
the ethereal gowns , which were decorated with blush pink rosebuds and smatterings of sparkle , will no doubt be gracing the @entity108 red carpet next year			0
the ornate gowns were sometimes slashed from the chest to the naval , but the long sleeves and floor - length hemlines kept a certain conservatism about them			2
@entity65 's haute couture show in @entity1 was held across two levels to add to the drama the most talked - about item on the catwalk was the latex legging boots with clattering metal heels @entity93 , a @entity97 - based @entity96 fashion designer , who is loved by @entity98 and @entity99 , sent models down the runway in beautifully embellished floral tulle gowns the @entity125 runway was a similar story			1
watched from the front row by @entity98 and her husband , the designers aimed to capture the @entity130 with a majestic collection that they say symbolised nature ’s regenerative powers			0
for @entity136 , the @entity125 muse is an ' exultant deity , whose gifts lend themselves to delight ' , they say			0
acclaimed for its excellence in craftsmanship , the @entity141 aims to inspire with eye - catching embellishment , such as petal appliqué and pearl embroidery ; the devil really is in the detail			2
the colour palette - crisp and most sophisticated - was full of pomegranate pinks , soft mints and cornflower blues			2
the collection , above all , aims to flatter the female form thanks to sheaths of organza , which promise to hug the figure in all the right places			0
the show saw the models metamorphose into fairies and nymphs , gracefully collecting blossoms in their structured collars or scattering buds into the folds of their gowns - and mrs @entity170 seemed most impressed			2
the designers at @entity125 were inspired by the ' goddess of spring ' with detail such as blue and white petal appliqué and pearl embroidery sewn to @entity178 - style dresses and flirty tulle - lined strapless dresses a model wears the bridal gown closing the @entity125 show in dramatic fashion @entity184 walked the @entity186 runway show in a dungaree style gown teamed with some interesting headgear @entity186 's show opened with the silhouette of a bride in a cloud of dry ice to the beats of @entity196 's @entity195			1
each model that followed rocked a look as flamboyant as the one before it from a red snakeskin blinged up trench - dress to a modern take on @entity204 ’s famous conical bra			2
@entity184 walked the runway show in a dungaree style gown teamed with a beekeeper-esque hat and @entity208 drew loud cheers as she closed the show looking as youthful as she did when she stepped out for the designer twenty years ago			0
@entity212 , a label coveted by the a-list , served up romantic skirts , dresses and coats printed with poetic embellishment			1
the brand 's creative directors , @entity221 and @entity222 , were inspired by ' love in its purest form ' and @entity19 was a story of billowing velvet dresses and hand - embroidered sheepskin coats			1
the duo 's main source of inspiration came from the work of @entity232 , the @entity234 - @entity233 artist who travelled between @entity235 and @entity1 before @entity236			0
the @entity19 pieces took cue from @entity232 ’s romantic and modernist interpretation of different cultures			1
there was plenty of white tulle hand - painted in grey and embroidered with pearls and delicate flowers			0
one dress , which was splashed with the moon and smatterings of stars , took a staggering 3,000 hours to embroider on hand painted linen			0
@entity212 served up romantic dresses and coats printed with poetic embellishment and hand - stitched motifs the brand 's creative directors were inspired by ' love in its purest form ' and the work of @entity232 fashion designer @entity186 and model @entity208 walk the runway at the end of the @entity186 show as part of @entity264 week			1
