that feeling of elation when handing over money at the till as the shop assistant puts your new dress into a bag , followed by that sinking feeling when you next look at your bank balance - millions of us have been there			2
but new research has shown the situation may be worse than previously thought - one in four women have admitted to being addicted to shopping and say they lie about how much they spend			1
but is it any surprise when it gives ladies such a rush ? the new study into 2,000 ladies found a third were at their happiest when spending money on new clothes			1
a new study shows a quarter of @entity29 women are addicted to shopping ( picture posed by model ) the addiction is n't purely about the clothes though , it 's also down to the effect it has on the body			1
45 per cent of those questioned get a genuine rush of excitement when they purchase new clothes , shoes and accessories			1
and while many credit having children , a rewarding career or being in love as making them truly happy , a third of women claim that nothing beats the buzz of strutting out of a shop swinging a bag full of new purchases			1
it seems we ca n't switch off from thinking about items we want in our wardrobe either once catching sight of something online or in a store			2
the longest the average woman avoids buying new clothes is two and a half months ( picture posed by model ) over half of @entity29 women said when they see something they like either on a website or in a shop they ca n’t stop thinking about it and 17 per cent revealed they even dream about clothes they are coveting			1
the poll by @entity76 - a shopping site that monitors items on all the top retailer websites in the @entity29 and alerts you when they drop in price - found the typical female ‘ watches ’ an item of clothing for at least seven days before buying			1
more than one in twenty even print out a picture of the must have item and pin it up at home or at work			2
if it ’s replacing something that i have worn to death i should replace it 2			2
if i can buy it outright and not go in to debt to buy it - i should have it 3			2
if it goes down in price i must have it 4			0
i will only purchase a luxury item if it was on offer 5			0

if i still want it after a week i should have it 7			0
if i have been thinking of it constantly i should have it 8			0
if i still want it after a month i should have it 9			0
if i have been good in other areas of my life ( like dieting ) then i should have it 10			0
if i have had a bad week or bad news i should buy it as a pick me up @entity117 , founder of @entity118 , said : ' most women will be able to relate to this research to some degree and there is obviously some truth in the phrase ‘ retail therapy ’			1
' when you see something you like and are still thinking about it a good while after , it ’s probably a sign you should buy it			0
' the study also found that the longest amount of time the average woman has gone without buying a new item of clothing is only two and half months			1
and then 40 per cent said they celebrate their abstinence with a big , spending blow - out			0
