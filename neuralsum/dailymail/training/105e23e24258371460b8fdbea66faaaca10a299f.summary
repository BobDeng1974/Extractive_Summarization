by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 09:47 est , 18 september 2012 police have dropped an investigation into a stolen mobile phone even though the female victim tracked down the thief , giving police a dossier of evidence including the suspect ’s photo			1
@entity11 , 68 , was ‘ furious ’ when police told her they were dropping the case despite the fact that she had traced the suspect to various addresses using a tracking device on her phone			1
her phone , a @entity20 worth £ 500 , was stolen from a west @entity22 cafe but ms @entity11 was able to trace it to addresses in @entity26 , north - west @entity22 and various addresses in central @entity22 using a tracking ‘ find my phone ’ app which was installed on the mobile			1
' on a plate ' : @entity11 gave evidence to police , including a photo of the suspect and various addresses , to catch the thief who stole her phone from a cafe ( in the background ) but police have dropped the case police responded to one call after the phone was traced to a central @entity22 pub but were unable to make an arrest because there were too many people in the building			1
monitored by her son @entity51 , an it developer , he noticed that the suspect had returned to the same cafe where the phone was taken and ms @entity11 went there with a friend and noticed a man sitting alone who she says was acting suspiciously			1
she took a picture of her friend with the man in the background and as the suspect left , ms @entity11 followed him to his car and recorded his registration details			1
she then gave this information to police			2
ms @entity11 said she contacted police numerous times after first reporting the crime in june before they closed the case last week , telling her they did not have the resources to follow it up			1
suspect photographed : after tracing her mobile back to the cafe where her phone was stolen using a tracking app on her phone , ms @entity11 took this photo of her friend , with the man she believes stole her phone sitting behind him ( to the right ) she said : ‘ i had given him to them on a plate and in the same cafe - all they had to do was check it out			1
‘ they just told me it was n’t a priority and then said they would n’t be pursuing it any further			0
' gave them everything ' : ms @entity11 says she contacted police on several occasions but was left ' staggered by their attitude and frustrated that they would n't take any action ' ‘ i told police all of this , gave them addresses , the photo and car registration			1
all in all i must have spoken to them seven or eight times and wrote several letters			0
i was staggered by their attitude and frustrated that they would n’t take any action			0
‘ i am so angry			0
i feel like i have been fobbed off			0
how much help do the police want ? i gave them everything			2
' all they had to do was make some routine inquiries but they ’ve just dropped it			2
‘ the police say they want help from the public to stop crime but my experience was the exact opposite			0
’ a police spokeswoman said : ‘ the victim initially reported her phone as a theft on 5 july after she had left it in a cafe			1
‘ she did not recheck the tracker until over a month later on 15 august			2
it was reclassified as a theft - related crime on august 16 and the investigation was given to an officer to review the crime			0
‘ there was no evidence this “ suspect ” did have her phone , delay between original report of loss and tracking info given to police , more than a month , meant he could easily have obtained it innocently			1
most robbers pass on within 24 hours			0
’ the case comes after a @entity143 reporter tracked down a robber who mugged him at knife point using a tracker app last week			2
following the incident , police said they had ‘ had some real successes using tracker technology to trace stolen phones and computers ’ , urging members of the public to ‘ help us to help you ’			2
ms @entity11 added : ‘ i know it ’s only a phone but if they ca n’t get the little things right how are they going to get the public to help on bigger crimes			1
‘ for all i know this person could be a serial thief			0
all it would take is one junior officer to look into it , run the number plate through the system , that sort of thing			0
‘ my son wanted to go round to the address but i ’m scared he will put himself in danger			0
we really should n’t have to do that			0
