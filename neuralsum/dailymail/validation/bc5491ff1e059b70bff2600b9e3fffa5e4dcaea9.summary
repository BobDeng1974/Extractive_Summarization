as @entity0 joined hands with his allies to give a triumphant salute on the steps of @entity5 , a great roar emerged from those @entity8 fans who had patiently waited to greet the new regime			1
the noise was more than three years in the making			0
after so many bitter disappointments , and so much anger directed at so many characters in this sorry saga , here was genuine belief that they finally had their club back			1
@entity0 , @entity20 and @entity21 were all elected as directors with around 85 per cent of the vote at friday 's general meeting			1
the same overwhelming number turfed @entity26 and @entity27 , @entity29 ’s two associates , out of the @entity30			1
a despised board was routed			0
@entity0 ( centre ) received almost 86 per cent of the votes from @entity8 shareholders for power at @entity36 the incoming directors have a resounding mandate for change but a mammoth task lies ahead			1
@entity8 , in many ways , is unrecognisable to what it once was			1
as both @entity0 and @entity20 have said , their job is to fix a club that is broken			1
to find the glue that sticks the pieces back together again , the @entity47 - based businessman believes they have to look back in time			2
not just in terms restoring financial strength and success on the field , but also in the image and values the club projects			2
‘ as a day in @entity8 ’ history , it ’s got the potential to be a watershed event , ’ insisted @entity0			1
‘ if you were to ask me sitting here today then i ’m confident it will turn out to be that			0
‘ people ask when will we take the club forward – in actual fact we are taking the club forward to the past			2
‘ we want to restore the qualities of this club and that is part of the challenge we face here , in trying to build a competitive football team and living up to what the fans expect			1
@entity8 supporters show their pleasure at the news that @entity0 at the decision of the shareholders vote ‘ there is a value system attached to @entity8 and this has been lost over the past few years			1
‘ @entity8 has been a club with traditional values			1
it ’s had generational support and a pass - on from father to son			2
there ’s been a consistency , an integrity and a loyalty			2
‘ @entity20 has referred to the fact the club has only had 13 managers in its history and that tells you there is a stickability about this club			1
‘ what we have seen over the last few years has been turbulence , change , lack of loyalty , lack of integrity			2
what has happened is the exact opposite to the values i associate with my club			2
’ @entity0 , @entity20 and @entity21 addressed staff inside @entity36 prior to holding a media conference , then travelled to @entity120 to speak with those on the footballing side of the business			1
in recent times , @entity8 has been a place where employees have lived in fear of redundancy			1
whole departments have pretty much disappeared			0
@entity130 has lurked somewhere south of dismal			0
a @entity8 fan holds up a sign in protest against @entity29 , @entity26 and @entity27 ‘ they very first priority is to get our arms around the club , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you have the unusual situation of one board en masse going out and another coming in			0
normally , there is a process of transition			0
‘ much of what we know about the state of the club has been gleaned from newspaper reports			2
the club is broken , it ’s broken in many areas			1
‘ there are footballing issues , infrastructure issues and scouting issues			0
information gathering will be a big part of our immediate job			0
’ a new manager will also be considered but @entity0 stressed that the importance of getting the right man means it will not be rushed			1
it could well be that @entity164 , the reluctant caretaker , still has a few games in charge beyond today ’ s trip to @entity168			0
@entity8 will have to come through the play - offs to reach the @entity171 next season , but @entity0 is adamant failure to win promotion would not derail plans to radically strengthen the squad			1
‘ promotion is going to be challenging and there is a possibility it wo n’t happen this year , ’ he admitted			0
‘ we hope that with a full resumption of attendance and energy from the fans that it might give the team a pick - up for the rest of the season			2
we chatted to the fans outside and we are really optimistic we will see full houses for the rest of the season to help the team kick on			2
‘ i hope they can still get across the line , but with improved cashflow we will get up the following season			0
i would expect a huge improvement in terms of quality on the field next season , whatever league we are playing in			0
800 @entity8 shareholders turned up to show their support to @entity0 at @entity36 on friday ‘ in terms of the manager , i have said before that we need more of a coach			1
we need someone with a different set of skills who is going to build , develop and bring youngsters through			0
we have to be very careful			0
’ @entity0 has already stated around £ 20million will be required in the short to medium term to get @entity8 back on their feet			1
he intends to provide half of what is needed			0
the remainder will come from other wealthy fans , including @entity223 – one of the @entity225 consortium - who was added to the board in the wake of friday 's result			2
asked how much of the total sum would be used on the playing squad , @entity0 replied : ‘ i have included other development issues such as a whole scouting network and maintenance of buildings			1
if you are asking for a rough figure , i would have to say it has to be more than 50 per cent			2
’ just 15 per cent of the club 's shareholders voted to keep @entity240 ( pictured ) and @entity27 in terms of the boardroom make - up , @entity0 insisted the fan groups deserved to be rewarded for their role in the revolution with representation			1
@entity26 and @entity27 have gone but are still nominally chief executive and finance director			1
asked if they would be sacked , @entity0 responded : ‘ i would n’t think so			1
’ have they a future ? ‘ i would n’t think so			0
’ take from that what you will			0
@entity29 still has the right to appoint two directors via the terms of the £ 10m loan facility the old board agreed with @entity260 in january , although @entity0 stated the funds are in place to repay that debt if preferable			1
@entity26 and @entity27 began the process of trying to draw down the second £ 5m tranche earlier this week			1
‘ if it is drawn down , i do n’t think it would be a bad thing , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it would nice to go in and find this £ 5m in the bank			0
i do n’t think it is likely to happen now			0
for it to happen , it would have to happen through engaging with the board			0
’ @entity273 abstained from using his voting block – now reduced to around 20 per cent – at the general meeting			2
yet that stance is unlikely to lead to an unexpected truce			0
‘ my personal view is that would be challenging , ’ said @entity0 when quizzed on whether he would work with current chairman of the football board			1
@entity0 ( centre ) will be joined by @entity21 ( left ) and @entity20 in running of the @entity284 club @entity0 has postponed his own instalment as plc chairman until he has satisfied the financial authorities and the @entity288 that he is a ‘ fit and proper ’ person			1
the @entity290 - born businessman remains adamant his 41 tax convictions in @entity47 should not be a barrier to a return to the @entity36 boardroom			0
he will ‘ formally engage ’ with a new nominated advisor ( @entity296 ) - to replace @entity297 – on monday			0
‘ either i am fit and proper or i am not , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i would n’t have started this process if i did n’t think i was fit and proper			0
‘ i ’ve had no discussions with @entity296 or other regulators that suggests there are concerns			0
‘ the only concerns that were aired came from the other side , who felt the need to flag this			0
‘ it was a mechanism to deflect away from their own failings			0
they had very little real arguments as to why there should n’t be a regime change			2
‘ if i was a concern then the nomad would not have engaged			0
the fact they are working with us tells you all you need to know			0
me sitting on the board is not critical , but i do n’t think it will be an issue			0
’ @entity0 will now start the process of rebuilding @entity8 which has been beset in turmoil for the past four years			1

around 85 per cent of shareholders backed @entity0 ’s push for change
electing him as a director *alongside* allies @entity20 and @entity21
he also gave @entity26 and @entity27 the boot from @entity8
now @entity8 fans believe their club is finally back in the right hands
