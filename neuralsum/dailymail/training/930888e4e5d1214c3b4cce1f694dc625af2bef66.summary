singles looking for a little affection on @entity2 can get some much - needed physical contact at this year 's first annual @entity4			2
but do n't get any bright ideas because the event is strictly non-sexual			2
@entity7 will happen on saturday at several locations in @entity9 , @entity10 and feature several workshops , classes and speakers			1
but the highlight will be an afternoon ' snuggle party ' expected to be attended by about 100			1

ground rules : @entity34 says those who attend the convention 's cuddle party must go through a 30 - minute consent class where they will be briefed on appropriate touching ' it has rules - it 's touch that would be appropriate to do in front of children , basically , ' @entity34 told the @entity45			1
' the space is big enough for about 100 people at a time			2

' there will probably also be some people just chatting in the corner , too			0
it 's not all cuddling			0
' the idea for @entity7 came about two years ago , when @entity34 had just finished going through a trying divorce and saw a man advertising free hugs on @entity64			2
at the time she thought she would definitely pay someone money just for a hug			0
that led her to start her own business , cuddle me up , where she provides platonic cuddles to clients			0
