police are using a database of up to 18million mugshots to identify suspects despite no proper legal framework being in place			1
forces across @entity7 and @entity8 have begun setting up the huge library of images without telling the @entity11 or watchdogs			1
many on the database would have been pictured on arrest but then not charged with any crime			1
however , their pictures remain on file indefinitely			1
forces have begun setting up the huge library of images without telling the @entity11 or watchdogs police can search the photo library for suspects using facial recognition technology			1
but biometrics commissioner @entity25 said last night that he was concerned about the implications of ' hundreds of thousands ' of innocent people being in the system			2
he told @entity29 that he was also worried about the risk of ' dangerous ' false matches as there had not been enough rigorous testing of facial recognition systems			1
mr @entity25 was appointed as the government 's first biometrics commissioner in march 2013 with the task of scrutinising official use of dna and fingerprint profiles			0
he said : ' my concern is not simply that important privacy and civil liberties issues have not been addressed			0
' although the technology could be ' tremendously useful ' in fighting crime , he was concerned at the public 's attitude			2
' its value will be very significantly undermined if the public can not have confidence in it and can not feel there are proper controls , ' he warned			0
mr @entity25 said the @entity56 had told police in 2012 to put rules in place about the proper use of mugshots but they had not done so			2
' there is always a danger that if you can do something then you will do it , the technology takes over ... without giving the attention to the other issues that arise , ' he said			2
mr @entity25 was also concerned about the reliability of the technology as a false match could ' easily send an investigation off into the completely wrong direction '			2
@entity74 said : ' you can not treat innocent people the same way you treat guilty people			0
you should not misuse the data in this way			0
no facial recognition software is 100 per cent reliable ' chief constable @entity81 , the national police lead on facial recognition , said the database was playing a valuable role but admitted it had ' no legislative framework '			1
@entity88 said the facial recognition system it began using last year had proved invaluable			1
a spokesman said the force has 100,000 photos and the software was 100 per cent reliable if there were clear images			0
but @entity74 , former @entity96 shadow home secretary , said : ' you can not treat innocent people the same way you treat guilty people			0
you should not misuse the data in this way			0
no facial recognition software is 100 per cent reliable			1
' @entity99 cabinet office minister @entity99 has demanded urgent action to regulate the use of the database , @entity29 reported			0
the @entity11 said it was reviewing the legal framework for the use of these images .			0
