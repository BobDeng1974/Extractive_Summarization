these dramatic photographs show the streets of modern - day @entity2 torn apart by the after - effects of a violent earthquake			0
buildings are reduced to rubble , huge craters have opened in the debris - strewn roads and uncontrollable fires have ripped through homes			2
fortunately , these pictures are a clever amalgamation of images of the city today and after the devastating quake of 1906			2
trip back in time : a women opens the door to her mercedes on @entity22 while horses killed by falling rubble lie in the street wonders of the modern world : a crowd from 1906 stare out over the burning city - and a 21st century bus foundations : shoppers blithely cross the street while workers begin the monumental task of rebuilding a destroyed @entity2 breathtaking : mr @entity36 returned almost 20 times to get the exact position and light right for this picture of the fallen @entity41 they were created by photographer @entity36 , a @entity2 resident who wanted to reimagine the traditional ' then - and - now ' concept			1
mr @entity36 first selects a catalogue of historical photos and then takes new ones from the same spot , which he softly blends with the old			1
once he has usable images , he has to recreate the exact conditions in which the original was taken - from where the photographer was positioned to where the sun is in the sky			1
i found that many of the original photos i planned to use were in fact unusable because the photographer was situated in a place where a building stands today , ' he writes on his blog			1
' others now have trees blocking the view			0
' my goal is to stand in the exact spot where the original photographer stood , ' he adds			1
' doing this needs to take into account equivalent focal length , how the lens was shifted , light conditions , etc. ghostly echoes : @entity76 at @entity77 and @entity78 is surrounded by the shells of wrecked buildings from the past trash to tourism : passing cable cars offer a view of the destruction of @entity85			1
cable cars at the time were crushed by rubble evocative : fire fills the streets around @entity91 - but does not quite reach the sunlit future - in one of @entity36 's mesmerising pictures broken windows : cars park in front of the brand new @entity99 , which survived the quake almost intact ' i take plenty of shots , each nudged around a bit at each location			1
just moving one foot to the left changes everything			0
he added : ' i kept running into delays			0
in the case of the @entity41 , i had to return to the scene on @entity113 between 18th and 19th four times before i managed to get it right			0
there ’s quite a bit of conflicting information of exactly where this building once stood			0
' and just when i was about to wrap things up , my dad announced that he had unearthed a local magazine published in late 1906 loaded with earthquake - aftermath photos that i had never seen in any library or online collection			2
' photography was a common hobby by 1906 and thousands of photos have survived to this day			0
one photographer even flew his £ 46 camera on a kite to get aerial shots of the aftermath			0
some colour photographs have even been found			0
strange visions : modern day business people and a child from 1906 face the camera while fire consumes a building on the corner of @entity144 and @entity145 fade out : cheerful tourists pass by the @entity147 , which still stands , but is destroyed inside from the fires always prepared : men pose in a tent city to house displaced residents while an armoured car turns left a corner in ruins : buildings fell , sinkholes in the streets opened up , railroad tracks bent , and collapsing bricks crushed cable cars during the disaster the 42 seconds of intense shaking made building collapse , sinkholes in the streets open up , railroad tracks bend , and collapsing bricks crush cable cars			1
four - day - long fires were responsible for 90 per cent of the destruction , with more than 30 , caused by ruptured gas mains , destroying around 25,000 buildings on 490 city blocks			1
many were started when firefighters untrained in the use of dynamite attempted to demolish buildings to create firebreaks , and the dynamited buildings themselves caught fire			1
mayor @entity179 put out an authorization for the federal troops and police to shoot and kill looters			0
thousands of tents and temporary relief houses went up to house 20,000 displaced people			0
mr @entity36 has spent more than two years recreating the chaos in 1906 + 2010 : the @entity188			2
ode to @entity2 : a tourist takes a photo of a cable car heading towards the @entity193 incline - if only he could see the aimless people of the past masterpiece : two girls stand before the partially destroyed @entity197 in @entity198 while students work on their art projects inside underground artwork : a woman walks dangerously close to a pit of rubble on 5th @entity144 by the @entity205 standing tall : pedestrians cross @entity207 towards a pile of rubble on @entity210 and the gutted @entity211			2

photographer @entity36 finds the exact spot each photo was taken and waits for the right light conditions
he studied *archives* of old photos taken at the time of the disaster
around 25,000 buildings were destroyed by fire that raged for four days after the quake
