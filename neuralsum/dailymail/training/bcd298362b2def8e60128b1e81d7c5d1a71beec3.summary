the @entity9 club 's annual accounts have been lodged at @entity10 and reveal that @entity0 's wage bill for the 2013/14 season was £ 190.5million , up eight per cent from £ 176m			1
@entity13 are currently the biggest payers in @entity16 football , shelling out a total £ 214.8m on salaries while @entity19 's wage bill dropped last season to £ 205m			1

@entity0 's accounts confirm the club 's announcement in november that they made a £ 18.4m profit last season - but shows this was helped by a £ 65m profit in player trading thanks to the sales of @entity27 to @entity13 , @entity32 to @entity33 and @entity60 to @entity61			2
