by @entity0 ' a full frontal assault on poor value for money ' : how pensions minister @entity3 dubbed the move to cap charges at 0.75 per cent rip - off charges which can wipe out more than a third of the value of a worker ’s pension pot will be banned next year			1
pensions minister @entity3 described the crackdown in which charges will be capped at 0.75 per cent as ‘ a full frontal assault on poor value for money ’			2
over the next ten years , workers who diligently save into a pension will be around £ 200million better off as a result of yesterday ’s announcement			1
this is because the money will go into their pension pots , rather than being siphoned off in high charges by well - paid fund managers			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ pension savers have paid too much for too long			1
it is time to put the saver first			0
we are going to put charges in a vice , and we will tighten the pressure , year after year			0

@entity41 ’s @entity40 on @entity42 campaign has been calling for lower annual fees on people ’s life savings , highlighting how they could strip tens of thousands of pounds from even a modest retirement pot. @entity41 editor @entity48 said : ‘ these types of charges are iniquitous because savers never realise the damage that ’s being done to their nest egg			1
‘ this charge cap is a major step forward and now needs to be applied to older types of pension as well as new ones			0
’ pension charges – an issue which few understand or can decipher on their annual pension statement – are levied each year as a percentage of the value of the pot during an employee ’s working life			2
their impact can be devastating			0
take the example of a £ 700,000 pension pot. if the annual charge is 1.5 per cent , it eats up £ 236,000 of the total value of the pension pot. if the charge is 0.75 per cent – the level at which the cap will be introduced next april – charges wipe out only £ 132,300			1
the 0.75 per cent cap will cover all pension schemes into which around 11million workers are being ‘ automatically enrolled ’ by their boss			2
since october 2012 , bosses must pay into pensions for their workers			0
an independent review , due to report at the end of the year , is deciding whether a crackdown on older company pension schemes is also necessary			0
the cap does not apply to non-workplace private pensions			0

in last week ’s budget , chancellor @entity116 scrapped the rule that forces workers to buy an annuity , an income for life , from an insurer when they retire			0
