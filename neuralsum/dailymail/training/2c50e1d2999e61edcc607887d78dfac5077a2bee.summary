@entity2 , 21 , lost control of her @entity4 when she drove over newly laid chippings after enjoying a meal with her twin sister @entity7			1
the fashion store manageress , from @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , was partially thrown out of the shattered driver 's window , suffering the injury that led to her death			1
ruling that the death was accidental , coroner @entity21 said that had she been wearing a seat belt @entity24 would not have suffered the injuries that led to her death			1
he took the chance to reiterate the importance of wearing a seat belt , adding ' seat belts do save lives '			1
he said : ' if i look at the last twelve months i have had four or five road traffic cases that were entirely survivable if the people concerned had been wearing seat belts			1
' after the hearing , miss @entity2 's father @entity36 said : ' she was responsible , independent and ambitious			1
she was a high achiever			0
' following her death , he described how his life had been ' ripped apart '			0
he said : ' she was 21 - years - old and achieving all she had set out to succeed in			2
' she was a highly social , well - loved girl who seemed to know everybody			0
her popularity is evident when you see the @entity46 tributes posted - and the lovely , kind words written			0
' the hearing also heard that there was no alcohol found in miss @entity2 's blood			2
the coroner said that before the incident in august 2011 , the 21 - year - old would have seen a warning sign advising motorists of a loose surface and recommending a 10mph maximum speed			2
the coroner said : ' at what speed she approached the bend the evidence i have heard does n't say but my impression is she went into that bend at a speed in excess of 10mph			2
friends : @entity2 ( right ) pictured with her twin sister @entity7 ( left ) , who she had enjoyed dinner with before the incident in august 2011 ' having gone around the bend the car went out of control			1
he added : ' there would have been a thickness of chippings			2
it could be that the nearside wheels went on to that area of thicker loose chippings			0
' the evidence is n't clear but that would possibly explain why the car went out of control			0
' ' the underlying cause of all this is she went in the right - hand bend at a speed that was , with the benefit of hindsight , higher than prudent for the conditions			0
that made the car go out of control			0
' senior gwynedd council engineer @entity96 said the road had not yet been swept when the accident happened .			0
