they might have thousands of pounds to spend on the best products and make - up artists at their beck and call but sometimes celebrities still slip up when it comes to their slap			1
this week @entity7 showed up to a @entity9 and @entity10 event sporting a two - toned chest , which appeared to be the result of badly applied contouring bronzer , leaving her with an unfortunate tide mark around her breasts			1
but the 17 - year - old is not alone as stars like @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 have all had very public make - up mishaps			1
she happily posed away while photographers snapped the bronzing boo - boo , yet the youngest of the @entity20 clan is not the first celeb to fail prey to a make - up malfunction			1
in fact her sister @entity20 , the ultimate queen of contouring , recently had a bit of a fail herself			2
while @entity20 showcased her dramatic new platinum ' do in @entity45 during @entity46 , she had paid less attention to her make - up and stepped out with a brown line running down her nose which had n't been blended properly			1
darkening the centre of the nose and highlighting the sides is a make - up artist 's trick for making the feature look thin and straight			1
the 34 - year - old is well known for her love of highlighter and deep contouring which excentuates her cheekbones			2
whilst out and about for @entity62 , who usually has perfect make - up , was spotted with a dodgy looking brown stripe going down her nose other stars such as @entity18 have also previously had maquillage ' mares			1
the actress was photographed at the premiere of @entity71 , to support husband @entity72 who produced the flick , with pale white powder in patches on her face			0
experts guessed that her make - up artist had been liberal with the translucent powder which mattifies skin without adding colour to it			1
however the product - which works well in photoshoots when the light can be controlled - is less forgiving on the red carpet			0
with so many flashbulbs going off , the light reflects off one of main ingredients in the powder , silica			0
@entity18 is one of the most famous stars to have suffered for a make up malfunction , she was once seen covered in white powder that had n't been rubbed in properly clearly @entity18 's husband @entity72 did not see fit to tell @entity18 that she was suffering from a make up malfunction as the pair attended a screening of @entity71 but @entity18 is far from the only celebrity to be coated in the face powder only to find it looks like she 's been flour - bombed in photos			1
at the 2003 premiere of @entity105 , @entity19 looked as though she was trying a geisha - inspired avant garde look			2
the former child star had so much white powder around her eyes she seemed to be wearing a white mask			0
@entity19 looked a fright at the 2003 @entity113 premiere of @entity105 : @entity114 @entity115 sported white powder on her nose and under her eyes , possibly a result of using powder intended for @entity121 film , not a camera flash at the @entity124 film premiere in @entity125 in 2009 and the usually pristine - looking @entity115 experienced a similar problem at the 2009 premiere of @entity124 in @entity125			1
the @entity129 star had white patches beneath her eyes and a smear on the end of her nose that looked as though she 'd just done some rather messy baking			0
@entity135 revealed her own penchant for translucent powder on a night out with entourage actor @entity138 in 2011			0
while her bronzed cheeks glowed , beneath her perfectly applied smoky eyes , the @entity140 star sported a thick line of white powder , making her look like @entity144			0
@entity135 displayed white powder under her eyes as she left a sushi restaurant in @entity146 with @entity138 in 2011 @entity147 sported a touch of white powder on her nose at a film premiere in @entity125 in 2010 @entity151 sported a huge white smear across her forehead and chalky remnants around her eyes and nostrils at a film premiere in @entity158 in november 2013 actress @entity159 is n't immune from a bad make - up job , pictured in @entity125 in 2011 meanwhile , it 's not just @entity163 celebs who seem to put their make - up on in the dark			1
tv presenter @entity166 fell prey to an attack of the eyeliner at the @entity170 awards in 2013 when her smudged look went really wrong			0
the @entity173 star is known for her distinctive @entity175 - inspired style with a heavy blunt fringe , strong eyeliner , bronzed skin and pale lips			0
however , at the event it looked as though she 'd applied her eye make - up in the car on the way to the show with liner so smeared it was streaked well below her lash line			1
@entity188 wisely sticks to natural make - up to enhance her year - round tan , piercing blue eyes and tawny long , layered hair			2
but at a screening of @entity194 in @entity158 in 2013 , she was left with marks from a cupping treatment , which she attempted to disguise with liberal applications of powder			0
the result was that rather than a series of marks from the treatment that uses suction cups on the skin , there were discs of bronzer all over her back instead			0
at the @entity209 in 2013 @entity166 turned heads for all the wrong reasons with her bizarre smokey eyed make up @entity188 tried to use make - up to cover - up the remnants of a cupping treatment , but the foundation only made the circles look worse at the @entity158 screening of @entity218 in 2013 but for every unintentional make - up mishap celebrities have worn perfectly - applied - but badly judged - lipstick , powder and paint			1
gossip girl @entity222 stepped out looking vampish in purple eyeshadow that had been painted around her eye sockets , and almost into her hairline			0
while @entity227 judge @entity226 is famous for inventing the ' smize ' ( smiling with your eyes ) at a @entity125 party in 2012 she took it too far - liberally painting black shadow across both lids			0
her garish pink lips did nothing to improve the look either			0
while many everyday women admit to applying their make - up on the move , it seems celebrities are guilty of the same grooming crime			2
@entity222 wore garish purple eyeshadow made worse with red lips at a @entity125 event in 2009 @entity226 looked like she had done her make - up in the dark with her thick black eyeshadow and neon pink lips at a ball in @entity125 in 2012			2

@entity7 was recently spotted with a bronzer tide - line on her breasts
the young tv stars ' contouring make - up had n't been blended properly
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity115 had powder fails too
