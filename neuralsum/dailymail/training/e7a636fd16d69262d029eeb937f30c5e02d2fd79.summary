by @entity0 published : 22:37 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 12:06 est , 2 august 2012 one of the disgraced badminton players disqualified from the @entity2 for deliberately throwing a match has revealed she is quitting the sport			1
@entity7 player @entity6 was top seed in the women 's doubles with her partner @entity11			1
today it was reported she announced her retirement on her micro-blog , bidding ' farewell ' to the sport			2
@entity7 officials had told their @entity2 badminton team leader and shamed players to make a public apology following the scandal , and chief coach @entity24 has since taken responsibility for @entity7 's part in the scandal			1
scroll down to hear the apology farce : @entity7 's @entity11 and @entity6 play against @entity31 's @entity30 and @entity32 - na @entity33 : kim ha - na ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) eventually won , despite their best efforts quiet word : tournament referee @entity37 was forced to intervene after all four players began missing routine shots the other women 's doubles players implicated were @entity31 pairs @entity30 and @entity32 - na , and @entity43 and @entity44 , plus @entity45 and @entity46 of @entity47			1
' the delegation has already severely criticised and educated the responsible badminton leaders , team and relevant players and demanded they profoundly recognise the seriousness and the harmfulness of this matter , reflect deeply on it , publicly apologise and resolutely prevent such incidents from happening again , ' the @entity7 news agency @entity48 quoted an unnamed spokesman as saying			1
@entity59 doubles champions @entity6 ( front ) and @entity11 , of @entity7 , watch as the shuttlecock yet again lands int he net @entity24 , chief coach of the @entity7 badminton team , said the poor behaviour of his players reflected the shortcomings of new rules in the sport			1
' i feel that no matter whether it is the rules or something else , that 's no excuse , ' said @entity24			2
' the key point is we did not behave professionally as athletes and did not treat each match seriously			0
' we did n't strive with all our might in the @entity2 way			0
from that point of view we really did n't grasp this point thoroughly ... as chief coach i really feel i must say sorry to fans and viewers nationwide , ' @entity24 told @entity48			1
the eight players were thrown out of the @entity2 for throwing matches in a bid to secure more favourable draws later in the tournament			2
the players had all qualified for the quarter - finals of the women ’s doubles and were accused of trying to manipulate the draw by losing so they would be matched with easier opposition in the next round or avoid playing their teammates			1
amid shameful and embarrassing scenes , players were deliberately serving into the net or hitting the shuttlecock over the court ’s lines			2
the longest rally in one set lasted just four shots			0
as a furious backlash grew , @entity112 , head of @entity113 , described the players ’ actions as ‘ depressing ' and ' unacceptable ’			2
the spotlight will be on the @entity7 , who dominate world badminton but have been accused of manipulation before			1
@entity121 , a @entity122 player who was on an adjacent court at the time of the first match , said @entity7 players routinely tried to avoid playing each other			1

i do n’t know who controlled the match to lose but if it is @entity7 again , they did it so many times last year – they did n’t play against each other in 20 matches			1
they do what they want			0
’ the @entity152 fiasco began when @entity7 top seeds @entity11 and @entity6 started to show little interest in beating @entity155 and @entity44 to finish top of @entity157 coming second would have meant avoiding compatriots and second seeds @entity161 and @entity162 until the final			1
the @entity164 responded to @entity7 ’s antics by copying them			1
referee @entity37 warned all the players and produced a black card , meaning they would be disqualified			2
after protests , this was rescinded			0
the match restarted and the @entity164 went on to win 21 - 14 , 21 - 11			0
the matter did not end there as a second @entity31 pair , third seeds @entity43 and @entity44 , attempted to engineer defeat in their match against @entity47 ’s @entity46 and @entity45			0
their motive was apparent retaliation to avoid @entity183 and @entity6 in the quarter - finals , an outcome they failed to achieve as they won 18 - 21 , 21 - 14 , 21 - 12			1
the @entity47 were not bystanders in the affair as they responded to the @entity164 by trying to lose themselves			0

at a press conference after tuesday 's match , @entity195 said the draw had been an ideal @entity209 would have topped their group with a win , but the draw meant they finished second			2
consequently , their quarter - final against @entity217 on friday will be played in @entity204			0
' it was a different way of playing compared to the usual game , but the players were on the same page as me , ' @entity195 said through a translator			2
' i feel sorry we could n't show a respectable game , but it 's my responsibility , not the players , why the game was like that			2
' it was important for us not to move to @entity202			0

’ miss @entity256 said the potential for match - fixing was raised in a managers ’ meeting on monday but the referee had dismissed concerns			0
she added : ‘ all the managers got together with the referee and said , “ look , this has happened ; in @entity272 you will find some very dodgy matches going on in the evening because of it ” and the referee laughed and said “ do n’t be silly ”			0
‘ the managers said “ we know the game , we know the players and we know the teams and we know this is going to happen ”			0
’ @entity31 ’s coach @entity279 laid the blame squarely at the feet of @entity7			1

they did n’t want to meet each other in the semi-final			0

chief executive @entity300 said : ‘ you get in to all sorts of strange precedents if people are n’t satisfied with what they see – it is very grey and dangerous territory			0
’ @entity309 secretary - general @entity308 said : ' the regulations clearly state you have to win every match and you can not throw some matches to win other matches			0
' there 's no two ways about that and that is what the disciplinary committee found in the principles of the @entity2 spirit			0
' the disqualification is from this event and there are no further punishments from now on			0
