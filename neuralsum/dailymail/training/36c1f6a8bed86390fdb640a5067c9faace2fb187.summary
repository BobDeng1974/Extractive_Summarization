@entity86 said trying to work with the parents was ' futile '			0
he wrote : ' this court has considered granting conditional custody to @entity7 's parents			1
unfortunately , there has not been any progress by the parents			0

' the judge also blamed the @entity101 for repeatedly declining to take the case from @entity1			2
devastated : mrs @entity7 , pictured with her daughter @entity103 , left , was taken away by @entity104 after she collapsed inside a courthouse in february			0
