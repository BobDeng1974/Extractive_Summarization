@entity0 and @entity2 's pet cat , @entity3 , survived six weeks trapped in a chimney at their @entity6 home a homesick cat used up at least one of its nine lives after surviving for six weeks stuck inside a chimney			1
the moggy , named @entity3 , endured a 20ft plunge before going weeks without food and water behind the sealed up fireplace			1
the stricken pet had been trying to get back into her home while her owners @entity21 and @entity2 were on holiday			1
she was pulled , barely alive from the shaft , six weeks later when the couple returned home and heard her cries coming through the walls			1
the couple had arranged with a neighbour to look after @entity3 in their absence , feeding her twice a day and letting her inside at night			1
but the homesick cat decided to try and break in to the house on december 6 - two days after the @entity35 arrived in @entity36 for a six week trip to see their son , @entity38			1
their neighbours spent a week searching for @entity3 but to no avail			1
mrs @entity43 even emailed them a photo of the seven - year - old cat from 10,000 miles away to be used on ' missing ' posters			1
then the day after the couple returned home they heard a pathetic meowing from behind the sealed up fireplace in an upstairs bedroom			0
mr @entity2 , 74 , used a knife to cut a hole through the sealant and found a skeletal - looking @entity3 barely alive			1
the white and ginger cat was rushed to a vets where she was found to have lost more than half her body weight and was given a 50/50 chance of survival			1
she was put on a drip and fed small amounts of food to help her build her strength up and is now well enough to be allowed home			1
mrs @entity43 , a retired schoolteacher from @entity69 , near @entity70 , @entity6 , said : ' it is almost unbelievable that a cat could survive without any food or water and in a tiny space of about one foot square for six weeks			1
' she was covered in cement dust from where she had desperately tried to claw her way into the room			0
i would think she has used up about eight of her nine lives in one go			0
' the couple left for their trip to @entity36 and @entity95 on december 4			0
two weeks before their other pet cat honey was sadly run over and killed in an accident			2
vets found @entity3 lost half her body weight during the ordeal neighbour @entity102 , who happens to be a veterinary nurse , kindly agreed to let @entity3 in and out of the house and feed her twice a day			1
mrs @entity43 said : ' the last time @entity3 was seen was on the roof on december 6			2
she would n't have fallen down the chimney by accident because she is so sure - footed			2
' she must have climbed down it as a way of getting into the house			0
' our neighbours were marvelous			0
they looked everywhere for her ; combed farm fields , spoke to people in the village with sheds and garages and printed posters with a photo i emailed them from @entity36			0
' they did their very best to find her			0
' we got back last saturday and the next morning i was in the spare bedroom on my own and heard a pathetic meow			0
i thought i was going mad			0
then i heard it again and thought it must be @entity3 but had no idea where she was so called my husband up			2
' we tracked it down to the fireplace and @entity2 cut a hole in the cardboard and pulled @entity3 out by the scruff of her neck , headfirst			2
' she was half - dead ; emaciated and could n't see anything as her eyes were opaque			2
we put her down but she could n't stand up by herself			0
' @entity139 rushed the severely malnourished and dehydrated cat to her work at @entity142 in @entity143 where she was given emergency treatment that saved her			0
vet @entity145 said : ' it is extraordinary			0
she seems to have recovered very quickly and has bounced back			0
