by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 07:47 est , 30 october 2012 @entity2 has revealed a new version of its mobile phone software in a bid to take on @entity6 and @entity7			1
the firm hopes that by making its software more similar to the new @entity11 software it launched last week , it can attract more users			1
at an event in @entity16 last night , @entity14 joined @entity2 bosses on stage for the unveiling , where the firm pledged to bring more apps to the platform			1
@entity2 corporate vice president @entity23 , ceo @entity24 and actress @entity14 hold @entity25 during its unveiling in @entity16 @entity2 ceo @entity24 with the handsets that will run @entity25 @entity2 has tweaked the software to look like @entity11			1
it has live tiles showing information directly on the start screen , such as offers or pictures			0
there is also a ' kid 's corner ' which allowing parents to give their children a phone ' locked ' to games or other apps			1
the company also promised to address one of the chief shortcomings with @entity25 : the dearth of third - party applications relative to offerings for @entity6 's @entity49 and devices running @entity52 's @entity7 system			1
@entity25 is the successor to @entity54 , which launched two years ago but has had little traction in the market			1
the new software will run on more powerful phones with flagship models coming from @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
together , they will launch eight @entity25 smartphones before the year is out , starting this weekend overseas and later in november in the @entity65 ' people all over the world are about to fall in love with @entity69 , ' @entity2 ceo @entity24 said at the event			1
@entity2 said it will also catch up in offering third - party apps			2
there are 120,000 applications available for @entity25 , but some apps that are popular on other systems are notably missing from @entity25 because it can be hard to get developers interested in writing programs for a small number of smartphones			1
@entity6 and @entity52 , by comparison , say their app stores both have 700,000 apps for phones			2
@entity2 ceo @entity24 with a @entity85 smartphone at the @entity16 launch of the new software however , the firm claimed it is patching some of those holes soon : @entity2 vice president @entity90 said internet radio service @entity91 is coming to @entity25 , along with games such as ' where 's my water ? ' soon , he said , 46 of the 50 most popular smartphone apps will be available			1
the company is also releasing an app for @entity99 , the internet calling service it owns			0
the @entity99 app available for @entity54 was an unfinished , or ' beta ' version , the firm claimed			2
the new @entity99 app will run in the background , listening for incoming calls without placing any drain on the battery , @entity90 said			0
actress @entity14 smiles on stage during the @entity112 event at @entity113 on october 29 the firm has signed up major operators around the world for the handsets			2
@entity119 executives in the @entity65 have said that they want to see a viable ' third ecosystem ' alongside @entity6 's @entity49 and @entity52 's @entity7			0
having more potential partners to work with provides the carriers with more leverage against each one and would make them less dependent on the whims of @entity6 and @entity52			0
@entity2 released @entity126 8 for desktops , laptops and tablets last week			0
that event was devoid of surprises , as @entity2 needed to work with hundreds of partners such as computer makers ahead of time			0
with smartphone software , the number of partners is much smaller , so @entity2 was able to save some details for monday 's launch event			2
for example , @entity90 revealed that @entity25 will come with a ' @entity142 ' feature			1
if enabled , kids will be able to start up the phone from the lock screen , gaining access to apps and games that the phone 's owner has designated as safe for them			1
@entity90 brought his three children on stage to demonstrate the feature			0
actress @entity14 lent star power to the event , endorsing @entity142 as a ' busy mom			0
' owners will also be able link apps to their lock screen , giving them at - a - glance information such as sports scores			2
windows 8 for computers has borrowed its look from @entity54 , presenting applications not as icons but as ' @entity168 , ' which can be animated with data from the application			0
for instance , the ' pictures ' tile shows a slideshow			0
@entity14 talks about how she uses the new features on the new windows phone 8 as a working mother and business owner the live tiles and the distinctive user interface remain @entity2 's biggest selling points for @entity25			1
in terms of third - party applications and the features of the phones , it 's mostly playing catch - up to the @entity49 and @entity7			0
@entity2 will be emphasizing the consistent look across devices in a massive advertising campaign that will talk not just about its new software , but its venture in hardware manufacturing			0
on friday , @entity2 released its first tablet computer , the @entity194			0
' between @entity11 , @entity194 or @entity25 , you wo n't be able to turn on the tv or open a magazine without seeing a @entity126 ad , ' @entity24 said .			2
