i may have looked like a petrified pterodactyl , but inside i felt like a fledgling sea eagle finding her wings			0
i was taking a turn at simulated skydiving on the new cruise ship @entity8 - and it was n't just the most exhilarating thing by far that i have ever done on a ship , it was the most extraordinary experience of my life			1
i 've often wished i could fly like a bird - but i would n't dream of jumping out of a plane , so i never expected to feel the sensation of soaring and swooping through the air in a vertical wind tunnel with no strings attached			1
taking flight : @entity19 does her best ' petrified pterodactyl ' impersonation on the @entity8 and the thrills kept on coming			1
inside @entity23 , a glass pod on a long arm , i was raised upwards and outwards over the side of the ship , 300ft above the waves			2
swaying in the wind , the pod rotated to show me people moving like ants around the blue postage stamp of the swimming pool on the deck far below			2
@entity36 was a spin in the bumper cars , racing around the ship 's huge @entity40 indoor arena until i was giddy			2
none of these exciting activities has been offered on a cruise ship before and i was among the first to have a go on a pre-inaugural mini-cruise aboard @entity46 , which has just started her winter season of @entity49 cruises			0
good news for @entity52 holidaymakers is that identical sister ship @entity8 , with all the same wow factors , will be based in @entity55 from next spring			1
shades of the future : @entity8 is being marketed as the world 's first ' smartship ' @entity8 makes the most of new technology			1
a few taps on a tablet computer and my order for a cocktail was being mixed by one of two robots with bionic arms			0
they could n't be trusted with real glasses , though , nor were they able to pop in a paper parasol , so my ungarnished drink slid towards me in a plastic cup			0
i saw a mesmerising show in the @entity77 lounge , which has floor - to - ceiling panoramic windows by day that turn into a curved screen 100ft wide and 20ft high , creating an eye - popping backdrop for singers and acrobats			0
even the musical in the main theatre was highly sophisticated by cruise - ship standards : a live orchestra in the pit accompanied the cast in a full - length version of @entity91 hit @entity92 ! another ' screentastic ' treat is in store for occupants of inside cabins			1
they get virtual balconies that have a vast screen showing the real - time view from the side of the ship			2
among the score of restaurants is the first at sea for @entity107			0
no need to leave a tip with this barman : robotic arms are on hand to dole out cocktails of your choice @entity107 's @entity116 offers the home - away - from - home comfort of the same menu as his chain on dry land			0
another celebrity chef , @entity122 @entity121 , author of @entity123 , has created the @entity126 restaurant , serving ' healthy yet indulgent ' dishes that are far less calorific than they appear			0
speed , efficiency and the end of queuing for the 4,900 passengers are promised thanks to online check - in , an app for everything , waiters taking orders on tablets , smart wristbands that do away with signing for all those extras , and the ship 's own satellite providing internet connection that 's as fast as broadband at home			2
@entity148 ( www.royalcaribbean.co.uk , 0844 493 2061 ) offers an eight - night cruise to the @entity150 on @entity8 from Â£ 1,499 per person			1
this includes return flights from @entity154 , one - night hotel stay , transfers and full - board cruise departing on march 13 , 2015 from @entity158 ( @entity159 )			0
@entity8 will start no - fly cruises from @entity55 in spring 2015 .			1
