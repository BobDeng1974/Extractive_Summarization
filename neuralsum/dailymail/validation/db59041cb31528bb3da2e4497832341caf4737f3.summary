atheists are the latest group that controversial @entity2 patriarch @entity1 has decided to train in his cross hairs			1
at a @entity6 prayer meeting last week , the 68 - year - old used a very graphic and brutal story about murder , castration and child rape to explain the inherent problems with non-believers			1
in his lucrative second career as a @entity15 speaker , @entity1 used the hypothetical situation to illustrate whether or those who do n't believe in @entity18 can know right from wrong			1
scroll down to listen controversial : @entity1 has developed a second career speaking at christian events ( seen here at one prior to his speech in @entity6 on friday ) the story begins with @entity1 challenging his audience to make a bet with him : ' two guys break into an atheist 's home			1
he has a little atheist wife and two little atheist daughters			0
two guys break into his home and tie him up in a chair and gag him			0
' with the unsettling scene set , @entity1 carried on with his morality tale			0
' then they take his two daughters in front of him and rape both of them and then shoot them , and they take his wife and then decapitate her head off in front of him and then they can look at him and say , ' is n't it great that i do n't have to worry about being judged ? is n't it great that there 's nothing wrong with this ? '' @entity1 said			1
' there 's no right or wrong , now , is it dude ? '' to finish off his point and leave his audience in no doubt about his point , @entity1 then took relish in describing a castration			2
' then you take a sharp knife and take his manhood and hold it in front of him and say , ' would n't it be something if there was something wrong with this ? but you 're the one who says there is no @entity18 , there 's no right , there 's no wrong , so we 're just having fun			2
we 're sick in the head , have a nice day			0
' outspoken : @entity2 's @entity1 ( pictured here in @entity73 in february ) made another controversial speech in @entity6 on friday to finish off his modern - day parable , @entity1 then said , ' if it happened to them , they probably would say , ' something about this just ai n't right			1
' this of course is just the latest in a long ling of controversial comments the @entity2 star has made			2
in 2013 during a @entity88 interview he likened homosexuality to bestiality and adultery and also said that black people were happier before the civil rights movement			0
in response to the speech , the @entity95 blog said that @entity1 probably does n't know any atheists and therefore is unqualified to make his damning assessment			0
' i do n't know a single atheist or agnostic who thinks that terrorizing , raping , torturing , mutilating , and killing people is remotely ok , and i frankly think that @entity1 does n't either , ' wrote the blog .			0
