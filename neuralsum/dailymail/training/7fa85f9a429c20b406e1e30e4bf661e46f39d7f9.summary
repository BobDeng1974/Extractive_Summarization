by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 5 january 2013 a body recovered from the sea off north @entity3 30 years ago will be exhumed this month in the hope it can be identified and returned to his family			1
the exhumation , from an unmarked grave on @entity10 near @entity11 , is part of an attempt by police forces around @entity15 to put names to more than 1,100 bodies found since the 1950s			1
it follows the launch of a website that posts pictures of unidentified dead bodies for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones			1
a body found in the sea off north @entity3 is to be exhumed from a cemetery near the @entity11 ( pictured ) found : the family of @entity32 were able to hold a memorial service for him late last year , 23 years after his body washed up on a north @entity35 beach in november , the @entity36 revealed it was launching a new website dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals			1
it features pictures of bodies , but any images deemed to be distressing are marked with a warning and require confirmation before viewing			1
they include a photograph of the arm of one body found collapsed in @entity49 , north @entity50 in 2007 , easily recognisable by the distinctive tattoos of panther and @entity53 on his right forearm			1
another case is that of an infant known as the @entity60 baby , a boy of around 34 weeks ' gestation who was found wrapped in plastic bags at @entity63 in @entity64 in january 2001			2
forensic tests established he had died two years earlier , but despite extensive inquiries his parents have not been traced			0
many of the bodies have washed up on beaches , unrecognisable as a result of being exposed to the elements , or have been discovered on railway lines			1
unidentified : the man on the left died after he was hit by a train in @entity78 in 1995			0
this man , right , was found lying in a makeshift tent adjacent to the @entity81 in @entity82 in 1997			0
both have never been identified tragic : pictures of unidentified dead bodies will be posted online for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones			1
this picture shows the tattoos on the arm of a man found collapsed in a north @entity50 street in 2007 unidentified : this computer - generated image is of a man found floating in the @entity96 , near @entity97 , while the man on the left was found washed up on a riverbank on the @entity100 some 250 people die on the @entity15 's railways every year , most as a result of suicide , according to @entity15 transport police , and a significant number of these bodies are never identified			1
there are hopes that in the coming weeks the man buried in @entity10 will join that list after contact was made with the family of a missing @entity115 seaman			1
the evidence was strong enough for the north - west @entity3 coroner to sign an exhumation certificate , and later this month the operation , involving police and forensic experts , will take place			1
detective constable @entity123 , who is running the investigation , said it was a ' rare and sometimes sensitive process '			0
' the circumstances surrounding this man 's death are not suspicious â€“ we are merely attempting to identify him for his family 's sake , ' he said			0
' that process will involve carefully obtaining dna samples and comparing them against the dna from individuals we have identified as possible family members			0
' search : the bureau has launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals			0
this shoe belonged to a man who was found in 2003 in the sea , near @entity145 , @entity3 the site : the bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals help needed : this clothing belonged to an oriental man found in the @entity153 near @entity154 in 1989 trying to find matches for the corpses against the list of the missing is also very time - consuming			1
by law , local councils must cremate or bury unidentified corpses , to avoid the risk of disease			0
this makes identification far more difficult : cremation destroys dna , while to exhume a buried body , police must seek the approval of a coroner before any further investigation can be carried out			1
the graves are often marked with wooden plaques stating ' unknown male ' or ' unknown female '			0
the @entity36 published a report on the number of missing persons and unidentified bodies in @entity15 based on figures provided by forces across the country on the number of missing person incidents reported in 2010/11			1
in @entity35 , the family of @entity32 were able to hold a memorial service for him late last year , 23 years after his body washed up on a north @entity35 beach			2
when an investigation failed to identify him , villagers in @entity191 held a funeral service and buried him in the churchyard			0
but detectives took a fresh look at the case as part of their review of unidentified bodies in @entity35 and @entity202 , and exhumed the body to retrieve a dna profile			1
crosschecked against the missing persons database , the profile matched that of @entity32			2
his sister @entity208 , from @entity209 , travelled to @entity35 last november with other members of the family for a long - delayed dedication			0
the bureau are a total of 1,029 cases of men and women who remain unidentified and 105 babies			0
just six per cent of those involve living people , most of whom have been found without identification and suffer from a form of memory loss or dementia			0
the vast majority of cases - 83 per cent - the bureau is desperate to solve involve dead bodies while there are still more than 100 unidentified body parts ( 11 per cent ) sitting in police morgues across @entity15 waiting to be identified			1
with a small number of body parts ( 11 per cent ) and unidentified alive people ( 6 per cent ) also still awaiting identification			2
@entity237 , from the @entity36 , told @entity238 : ' for us it is about asking how we can be in such a developed society and yet have such a large collection of unidentified people , when it is actually quite difficult to disappear nowadays			0
' so how is it we have n't been able to recognise these people ? there will be a family that is missing someone and it is right they know where their loved ones are			2
' members of the public are now able to search the cases and provide information online			0
any relevant details will then be passed to the police or the coroner in charge of the case			2
the bureau was unable to give any details of individual cases - other that the ones highlighted here - but a spokesperson said the website had already been significantly slowed due to the amount of traffic it has already received			0
the @entity15 @entity36 continually work with police forces and the public to try to put a name to these individuals , to enable them to be put at rest and to provide closure for their family and friends			2
the @entity36 is also running a special project , called @entity281 , providing resources to assist police forces to identify their outstanding unidentified people , bodies and body part cases			1
similar websites have been set up in certain states in the @entity289 , and by police in @entity291 and @entity292			0
the @entity36 is part of the @entity294			2
