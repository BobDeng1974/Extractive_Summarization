by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 11:13 est , 29 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:13 est , 29 december 2013 one in four university students now lives at home with their parents , heralding the end of an era for a generation of school leavers who once dreamed of independence			1
in the last decade the number of undergraduates choosing to stay with mum and dad has risen by 50 per cent			0
soaring living costs and a trebling of tuition fees are forcing growing numbers of students to abandon hopes of moving out			1
@entity23 : the proportion of students living with their parents has gone from 20 per cent to 25 per cent in a decade the cost of being a student has soared in recent years , and can easily top £ 22,000 including course charges , living costs , rent , food and travel			1
the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) says accommodation costs have doubled in the last 10 years , while the coalition has increased tuition fees from £ 3,000 to up to £ 9,000 - a - year			1
the rush in recent years for half of all young people to go to university has increased the pressure , but many find they can not afford to live away from home			2
it suggests some students are being forced to choose to study at universities closer to where they grew up , even if they do not offer their preferred courses			0
the increase in tuition fees to up to £ 9,000 - a - year has added to the cost of being a student latest figures show that 237,000 undergraduates were living with their parents in 2011 - 12 , compared to 672,000 living away from home			2
a similar ratio applies to older students and post-graduates , according to figures published by universities minister @entity60			0
in 2002 - 03 , fewer than 20 per cent of students lived at home			1
@entity63 , @entity33 vice president ( welfare ) , said : ‘ more research needs to be done to understand this increase			0
some students are choosing different routes into higher education , such as further education colleges , but a rise would not be surprising considering that accommodation costs have doubled in the last decade , and , aside from tuition fees , which have now tripled at many universities , students are also expected to pay out for extra academic expenses			2
former universities secretary @entity77 said more students should live at home , to save them and the taxpayer money ‘ many students at university are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials			1
‘ students should n’t be put in a position where they feel they need to sacrifice going to their ideal university by choosing an institution that is close to home so they can save on their living costs			1
’ however , it has been claimed that if the expansion of degrees is to continue more students will have to choose to study close to their parents ’ home			2
@entity77 , who was universities secretary in @entity105 ’s @entity104 , said more should be spent on higher education but studying close to home was not necessarily a bad thing			0
mr @entity77 , who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions , said : ‘ the overwhelming expansion in student numbers has been in students living away from home , which is much more expensive for the taxpayer and more expensive for the student			1
i think the interesting question this raises is whether we should n’t be trying to look at enabling more students to get a high quality education closer to home			0
‘ many students feel they have to make themselves financially worse off in order to do the course that they want to do			0
‘ i think as a country we actually need to spend more of our national wealth and private wealth on higher education than we do at the moment			0

237,000 university students living at home with parents , up 50 ***%*** in 10 years
