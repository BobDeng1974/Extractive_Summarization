by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:41 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 9 february 2013 @entity2 today announced the cabinet minister overseeing the ' shocking ' horsemeat scandal has been summoned to return to @entity5 to get a grip on the crisis and reassure the public			1
after a day of confusion surrounding the whereabouts of environment secretary @entity12 , it emerged he has spent the day dealing with the scandal over the telephone from his @entity16 constituency			1
the prime minister used a press conference in @entity19 to announce ' the secretary of state for agriculture is returning to @entity5 ' after the government admitted it can not guarantee that food being served in schools and hospitals today does not contain horsemeat			1
he added : ' this is n't really about food safety			0
it 's about effective food labelling , it 's about proper retail practice , and people will be very angry to find out they have been eating horse when they thought they were eating beef			1
' i know there is great public concern about this issue , ' he said during a press conference in @entity19			1
in the wake of fresh revelations that @entity52 beef lasagnes contained 100 per cent horse meat since last summer , police forces across @entity48 are now investigating ‘ criminal acts ’ , @entity27 said			1
this morning a spokesman for the prime minister told journalists mr @entity12 was working on the crisis from the department in central @entity5			1
but it has now been confirmed that he was in fact in @entity16 , but has been in regular contact with officials , retailers and inspectors from the @entity66			1
mr @entity12 has been accused of ‘ pretending this is n’t happening ’ amid growing calls for ministers to convene an emergency cross-government summit to get a grip on the crisis			2
it is understood he will now chair an emergency summit with retailers , suppliers and @entity66 officials tomorrow morning , amid concern in government that mr @entity12 has not been visible to reassure the public			1
environment secretary @entity12 is coming under pressure to prove the government has a grip on the crisis the government has stressed that the responsibility for knowing what is in food lies with retailers , but held out the prospect of a wide - rangng review of food standards laws to prevent a collapse in public confidence in the security of the supply chain			1
but both @entity96 and the @entity97 refused to say what checks were being carried out by the government on beef products being served and sold to schoolchildren , hospital patients and prisoners			1
and the @entity105 sought to absolve itself of responsibility			1
a spokesman said : ' a @entity110 spokesman said : ' it is not a @entity113 issue – every hospital sources its own food , it would be a case of speaking to every hospital			2
it is all locally sourced			0
' the @entity120 union said hospitals , schools and meals - on - wheels services should check they are not serving horsemeat			1
@entity125 said : ' hospitals , schools and council care services provide millions of meals with meat products every week to the young , the elderly and the sick			2
' with rising public alarm over the prevalent use of horse meat in retail food products and possible health issues , the government must require all public services that feed vulnerable members of society to verify that they have not used horse meat			1
' mr @entity141 , the @entity142 junior farming minister , was asked to reassure parents and patients that horsemeat was not being served in schools and hospitals			1
but he told @entity148 : ' you are asking me to give an assurance on behalf of a great number of different purchasing agencies , lots of different people who make their own decisions about what is appropriate			0
' we have given advice we hope people will follow			0
there is no danger to health but we are very concerned about the contamination of one species to another			0
' he confirmed that the cases were being investigated by the police who are ' looking at whether there has been criminal behaviour in this country and abroad , we ’re involving all the relevant police authorities along with the food standards agencies to make sure that if there is evidence of criminality that we identify it , and we deal with it '			2
a spokesman for the prime minister said : ' our advice is to follow the advice of the @entity66 and retailers about the products they have bought			1
' ‘ [ the pm ] is aware of the very distasteful issues which has come to light			0
distasteful though this is , there is nothing to suggest any health risk , ’ she added			0
the scandal broke on january 16 , when the @entity195 revealed beefburgers contatined equine dna , including @entity199 beefburgers which were 29 per cent @entity200 than 10million burgers were stripped from shelves , including @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0
last night , the @entity206 ( @entity66 ) finally acted in the growing crisis and demanded a massive sweep of all beef products for the presence of horse meat			1
fresh revelations : @entity52 confirmed last night that it has been selling packs of its frozen lasagne that contained 100 per cent horse meat @entity217 ’s @entity216 , the shadow environment secretary , said : ‘ i ’m waiting for the government , the experts , for the scientists to issue proper clear advice for consumers			1
‘ it ’s simply not good enough for ministers to sit at their desks and pretend this is n’t happening			0
’ she said ministers had ‘ pooh - poohed ’ her concerns about horses being slaughtered in the @entity230 , in abattoirs and testing positive for banned veterinary medicine @entity232			0
‘ it transpired in answers to my parliamentary questions that six animals had actually entered the human food chain – five in @entity239 and one in the @entity230			0
and two animals have still not been traced by the @entity66			2
’ asked if customers should eat beef which they have previously bought and are keeping in their fridge or freezer , miss @entity216 replied : ' i certainly would n't , but i 'm waiting for the government , the experts , the scientists , to tell us and issue proper clear advice for consumers			1
conservative mp @entity252 , chair of the @entity254 select committee , echoed miss @entity216 's sentiments as she insisted that she would no longer eat processed beef until the scandal was over			0
@entity27 has tried to distance itself from the horsemeat scandal , insisting it was the responsibility fo the @entity66			1
a @entity96 spokesman added : ‘ they are working with the authorities and police in this country as well as other countries			0
‘ at the moment we are looking at two incidents that have come to light which at the heart are acts of criminality which seem to raise an issue that happened overseas with regard to what food has been imported into @entity230			2
‘ we want people to be reassured that what people see on the label is what they see on the package			0
it is legal to slaughter and sell horsemeat in the @entity230 provided it is from an approved abattoir			0
‘ but no - one wants to take away from the fact that these cases are distasteful			0
we are very concerned about the issues that have been brought to light and that is why there are investigations ongoing			0
’ the @entity52 lasagne packs were made by a @entity239 company , @entity296 , at a plant in @entity298			2
@entity296 also makes beef products for @entity199 and @entity203			0
both supermarket chains have now withdrawn potentially affected lines from their shelves as a precautionary measure			0
today mp @entity304 claimed to have evidence that the company was told that it had inadvertently been selling impure meat as early as last saturday , and that the violations dated back to august last year			0
mr @entity304 , @entity217 's outspoken deputy chairman , wrote on his blog today that he had obtained a letter sent by @entity52 to its wholesale customers warning them that their products did not conform to regulations			2
the letter read in part : ' investigations have led one of our suppliers based in @entity239 to inform us in writing on 2nd february 2013 that the raw materials delivered since 1st august 2012 are likely to be non-conform and consequently the labelling on finished products is incorrect			0
the supplier has asked us to withdraw the raw material batches			0
' @entity52 could not be reached for comment on mr @entity304 's claim			2
@entity52 had asked retailers to remove three sizes of beef lasagne packets – 320g , 360g and 500g – from shelves on monday , citing what it called a ‘ labelling issue ’			1
but it has now emerged the products contained horse meat , which constitutes a crime under consumer labelling laws .			2
