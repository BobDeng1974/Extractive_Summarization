by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 19:45 est , 23 october 2013 all babies and young children should be given free vitamins on the @entity4 to combat rising cases of bone disease , according to @entity8 ’s chief medical officer			1
renewed fears about rickets caused by lack of vitamin d have prompted professor dame @entity13 to call for a review of current policy , which distributes free vitamins only to low - income families			1
rickets , a scourge of @entity20 , was virtually eradicated after the @entity21 but is returning in children due partly to lack of outdoor play and to poor diets low in vitamin d - rich foods such as oily fish , eggs and liver			1
professor dame @entity13 said all babies and young children should be given free vitamins on the @entity4 during the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil , but this practice stopped in the 1950s			1
in a report , professor @entity33 also warns children ’s health in the @entity36 is slipping behind other major @entity39 countries			2
a spoonful of cod liver oil used to be a daily routine for millions of children			2
the practice began during the @entity21 amid concerns that rationing might deprive children of vital nutrients			0
the strong - tasting oil comes from the liver of cod fish , and because of its high levels of vitamins a and @entity12 it was intended to prevent diseases such as rickets			1
its high content of omega - 3 fatty acids – which some research suggests boost brain power in children – may have been a beneficial side effect			2
other studies show it works as an anti-inflammatory for adults with rheumatoid arthritis and may help alleviate joint stiffness in osteoarthritis			0
modern cod liver oil has a higher vitamin a content compared with decades ago			1
five extra children die a day from potentially avoidable causes in the @entity36 compared with @entity73 , mostly during the first year of life , she said			0
giving vitamins could help reverse the trend , she claims			2
‘ we know that many children , not just those in vulnerable groups , have vitamin deficiency , ’ she added			2
she has asked the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) to examine whether it would be cost - effective for all children to receive daily drops or tablets containing vitamins a , @entity88 and @entity89 the @entity4 already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins , but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the @entity4 ’s means - tested @entity95 scheme			1
professor @entity33 said the @entity36 ’s record on children ’s health used to be ‘ one of the best but we are now the worst ’			2
possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking , and poor care in infancy			0
@entity106 is on the rise due partly to a lack of outdoor play and poor diets low in vitamin d - rich foods she singled out rickets , saying it was making a comeback , with about 800 cases a year			1
‘ it ’s appalling , ’ professor @entity33 said			0
an estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin d levels below the recommended amount			0
the vitamin helps the body absorb calcium , essential for healthy bones and teeth			0
meanwhile vitamin a strengthens children ’s immune systems and eyesight and maintains healthy skin			0
@entity131 is important for general health and helps the body absorb iron			0
‘ we are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take - up is low , but many children not in these communities need them too , ’ professor @entity33 said			1
she said a scheme in @entity143 to offer vitamin d supplements to all children means one in five now take them – halving the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems			0
there is evidence lack of vitamin d might contribute to longer term health problems involving the immune system , she said			1
@entity156 , editor of the report , said : ‘ we do know from studies that making vitamins available to all can lead to a boost in families taking up the offer			1
’ other recommendations include assigning a named gp to every child with long - term conditions and a regular survey on children ’s mental health			0
the report also says reducing obesity by one percentage point in children could save the @entity4 £ 1billion a year			0
professor @entity33 said 12.5 per cent of toddlers are obese , as are 17 per cent of boys and 16 per cent of girls aged up to 15 , adding that the ‘ long - term consequences are massive ’			1
rickets , or soft and deformed bones , was first noted by physicians in ancient @entity182 but was not linked with lack of vitamin d until the start of the 20th century			1
it was common in @entity188 times because of lack of access to sunlight – which the body needs to make vitamin d – and poor diets			1
it mostly disappeared in the @entity196 during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine , and children were also routinely given cod liver oil			2
@entity106 is still a major problem in third - world countries			0
however , @entity36 cases have been rising in the past 15 years , from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011			0
experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past			2
they also blame extensive use of sunscreen , and children spending more time indoors .			0

professor dame @entity13 has called for a review of current policy
at the moment free vitamins are only given to low - income families
disease is on the rise because of a lack of outdoor play and poor diets low in vitamin d - rich foods such as oily fish , eggs and liver
