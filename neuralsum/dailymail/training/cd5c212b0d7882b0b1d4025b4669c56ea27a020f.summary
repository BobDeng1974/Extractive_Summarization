@entity1 businessman @entity0 will seek to have his disqualification from owning @entity3 overturned at an appeal hearing on thursday			1
@entity0 was barred by the @entity6 's board from being owner and a director of @entity3 in december after it ruled his conviction for tax evasion was a ' dishonest act '			1
@entity0 's appeal will be heard by a three - person professional conduct committee , chaired by @entity14			2
the outcome is likely to be known next week			0
@entity0 will appeal against the @entity6 's decision to disqualify him from owning @entity3 if the @entity6 's disqualification is upheld , it will mean 58 - year - old @entity0 will have to step down as a director - but only until march , when his conviction becomes spent under @entity22 law			1
@entity0 was fined 600,000 euros ( Â£ 465,000 ) by a court in @entity24 last march after being found guilty of failing to pay import duty on his yacht , the @entity27			2
@entity28 was also the person who allowed @entity0 's original appeal back in april on the basis that there were no written reasons available from the court case which would determine whether it was a dishonest act or not			0
@entity0 was disqualified in december after he was convicted of tax evasion in @entity1 last year however , the @entity36 stated in his decision allowing that appeal : ' if the reasoned ruling of the court in @entity41 discloses the conduct of mr @entity0 was such it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest , he would be [ disqualified ]			1
' the @entity6 then applied to the court in @entity41 for those written reasons , and once it had received them its board took the view that the conviction did constitute a dishonest act and announced he was to be disqualified			2
@entity0 may try to claim that under @entity1 law he is still presumed innocent because the appeals process has not been exhausted			1
the issue with that , however , is it means he would then be gaining an advantage on any club director dealt with under @entity22 law where they are viewed as being guilty after the initial conviction			1
if upheld the disqualification will end in march because conviction becomes spent after one year under @entity22 law the @entity6 originally said @entity0 had to resign as a director of @entity3 by december 29 but agreed to defer that deadline until two days after the final decision by the professional conduct committee			1
a statement from the league last month said : ' as a consequence , the parties have agreed that if mr @entity0 is unsuccessful in his appeal , any disqualification period will be extended by an amount equivalent to the length of time between december 29 and the deferred deadline			2
' @entity0 took over @entity3 towards the end of last season and has already fired two managers - @entity79 and @entity80 - during this campaign			0
q : what is happening with @entity0 ? a : he is appealing against the @entity6 's board decision to disqualify him from being owner and a director of @entity3 in december on the basis that his conviction in @entity1 for tax evasion was a ' dishonest act '			1
q : what was his offence ? a : an @entity1 court ruled he had deliberately evaded import tax on his yacht , the @entity27 , when he brought it to @entity41 in @entity24			2
q : what will happen if he loses his appeal ? a : he will have to resign as a director of @entity3 and have no involvement in ownership or executive decisions			0
q : how long will the disqualification last for ? a : only until march			0
q : that does not seem to be long at all - why such a short time ? a : the @entity22 government changed the law last year so that anyone who was only fined for an offence would have their conviction regarded as being spent after only a year			1
previously it had been five years before convictions became spent			0
q : who is hearing the appeal ? a : the professional conduct committee - a three - strong panel chaired by @entity14			0
q : anything interesting about @entity28 ? a : he pronounces his surname ' car '			0
he has often sat as an arbiter on international and domestic sports disputes and disciplinary issues			0
according to his @entity129 biography , he is a keen @entity130 fan and has run four marathons and speaks @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 - but not @entity1 .			0
