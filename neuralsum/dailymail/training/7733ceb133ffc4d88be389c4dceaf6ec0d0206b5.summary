the former @entity1 police chief who led the investigation into the murder of six - year - old beauty queen @entity4 has admitted that officers botched the initial handling of the crime scene			1
@entity8 , former chief of the @entity9 , gave his most extensive comments on the case to date in an ' @entity13 ' session on @entity13 on saturday			1
but he has since said that he had no idea he was speaking on a public forum , and that he regretted his ' naivete '			1
' i talked to the organizer , and my impression was that this was a members - only type group that talked about unsolved mysteries all around the world , ' @entity8 , 59 , told the @entity24			1
@entity27 was found dead in the basement of her family 's home on december 26 , 1996 , hours after her mother , @entity25 , called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note demanding $ 118,000 had been found			1
speaking out : @entity8 , former chief of the @entity9 , gave his most extensive comments on the @entity4 case to date in an ' @entity13 ' session on @entity13 on saturday although no one has ever been charged , suspicion has long fallen on her parents , @entity37 and @entity38 , but there was not enough evidence to bring charges against them and they were ultimately cleared			1
on the @entity13 forum , @entity8 , who joined the investigation nine months after @entity4 's death , said on the day @entity4 's body was found , police should have separated the couple to get full statements from them			1
the case was initially mishandled due to a ' perfect storm type scenario ' , he wrote			2
' it was the @entity55 holiday and we were short staffed , we faced a situation as i said earlier that no one in the country had ever seen before or since , and there was confusion at the scene as people were arriving before we had enough personnel on the scene , ' he wrote online			2
' i wish we would have done a much better job of securing and controlling the crime scene on day one			2
we also should have separated @entity38 and @entity37 and gotten full statements from them that day			0
' letting them go was a big mistake , as they soon lawyered up and we did not get to formally interview them again until may of 1997 , five months after their daughter was murdered			2
' investigation : @entity8 , pictured in december 1997 , joined the investigation into @entity4 's murder nine months after the little girl , pictured right , was found murdered in her family 's basement in 1996 questions : @entity8 said he wishes police had interviewed @entity38 and @entity25 , pictured in may 1997 , immediately after the body was found			1
he said officers found it bizarre that the couple was barely speaking on the botched case : ' it was the @entity55 holiday and we were short staffed , we faced a situation as i said earlier that no one in the country had ever seen before or since , and there was confusion at the scene as people were arriving before we had enough personnel on the scene			1
' on the @entity101 : ' we also should have separated @entity38 and @entity37 and gotten full statements from them that day			0
letting them go was a big mistake ... the officers also noticed the how distant @entity38 and @entity37 seemed to be toward each other			0
' on her brother , @entity108 : ' after a short initial interview that day ... @entity108 was only interviewed one more time and that was by a social services worker			2
we of course had many other questions we wanted to ask him as the investigation wore on , but were never given an opportunity to interview him again			0
' on a possible intruder : ' most investigators do not believe there was a legitimate point of entry			0
it is unknown how an intruder may have gotten in			0
' on a motive : ' neither the pd or the @entity129 believe this was ever a kidnapping			0
it was a murder that someone tried to stage as a kidnapping			2
' on prior sexual abuse : ' evidence was found that would indicate she was sexually assaulted some time prior to the day of her death			0
' on the singularity of the case : ' the @entity129 told us they 'd never seen a 2.5 page ransom note ... ours was and to my knowledge still is the only case in history where a body was found in the same house as a ransom note demanding money			1
' on who he thinks is responsible : ' i have avoided saying who i believe is responsible and let the facts speak for themselves			0
there are several viable theories			0
' for the full @entity13 thread , see here			2
no one has ever been prosecuted in the case , and @entity8 said he doubted anyone ever would be			1
' [ @entity166 ] do not believe anyone will ever be convicted in the @entity27 case , ' he told @entity13 users			1
court documents released in 2013 showed that a grand jury recommended indictments against the @entity101 , contrary to the long - held perception that the secret panel ended their work in 1999 without deciding to charge anyone			0
the documents revealed that the parents had been indicted for felony child abuse resulting in death and accessory to the crimes of first - degree murder and child abuse resulting in death - but that then - district attorney @entity186 had refused to sign the indictments			2
at the time , @entity186 did n't mention an indictment , saying only that there was n't enough evidence to warrant charges against the @entity101 , who had long maintained their innocence			0
on the forum , @entity8 touched upon the trouble his department had experienced with the @entity198 's office under @entity186			1
' da involvement in this case was inappropriate , ' he said			0
' they interfered in the investigation by being roadblocks to getting things done			0
' @entity37 passed away from cancer in 2006 , and two years later , former district attorney @entity206 cleared the @entity101 of any role in their daughter 's death , based on dna evidence that pointed to the involvement of a third party			0
@entity8 would not say who he believed might be responsible for the killing - ' there are several viable theories ' - but he did say that investigators did not believe there was a ' legitimate point of entry ' for an intruder to get into the house that night			2
he said that the girl was hit hard across the head and then , after it was clear that she had not died , she was strangled between 45 minutes and two hours later , based on her brain swelling			0
' the rest of the scene we believe was staged , including the vaginal trauma , to make it look like a kidnapping / assault gone bad , ' he said			2
no role ? the @entity101 , pictured in 2000 , were cleared in 2008 of any role in her death based on dna evidence that pointed to another person			0
it later emerged that a grand jury had wanted to indict them red herring : in 2006 , the @entity244 ordered the arrest of @entity4 , who appeared to have incriminated himself in the case , but he was promptly cleared by the police department			1
@entity8 called it ' embarrassing ' he added that they came across evidence that would indicate the girl had suffered prior sexual abuse			1
after an apparent sexual abuse the night of the murder , the killer then dressed her - which caused one @entity258 to note : ' i guess there was n't a time problem for the killer '			1
@entity8 added : ' the killer also took the time to find a pad and sharpie pen , write a 2.5 page ransom note , fashion a garrote and choke her with it , then wrap her in a blanket with one of her favorite nightgowns and place her in a storage room in the basement			1
he / she / they then neatly put the pad and pen away and escaped without leaving much evidence			0
' he added that the @entity129 told the police they had never known of a 2.5 - page note and had never had a case where the body was found in the same place as a ransom note			1
when police turned up at the home , they found mrs @entity4 's tone with them ' very strange '			2
' the officers also noticed the how distant @entity38 and @entity37 seemed to be toward each other , ' he said			0
@entity8 , who was named police chief of @entity295 in 1998 before retiring in april last year , is now teaching several law enforcement classes online through @entity297 in @entity298 , and said he would consider writing an autobiography about his career			1
questions : @entity8 said the girl was knocked across the head and then strangled inside the family 's @entity295 home ( pictured ) before a ransom note was written - but that investigators believed an intruder was unlikely despite his misgivings about speaking out on @entity13 , he said he believed he had spoken honestly and fairly to readers , the @entity24 reported			1
' i think the only thing i would emphasize is that the unknown dna ( from @entity4 's clothing ) is very important , ' he told the newspaper			0
' and i 'm not involved any more , but that has got to be the focus of the investigation			0
in my opinion , at this point , that 's your suspect			0
' current @entity295 police chief @entity323 told the @entity24 that he did not know @entity8 was going to discuss the case online			1
' i learned about it by seeing it posted online , ' @entity326 said			0
' i did n't read it line for line , but @entity8 understands the nature of that investigation , and certainly would n't do anything to compromise it			1
' he added that the investigation remains open and whenever they receive new tips in the case , they are investigated .			2

@entity8 , the former chief of the @entity9 , took part in an ' @entity13 ' session on @entity13 on saturday
he has since said he did n't know he was speaking on a public forum but had tried to be honest ; the current police chief has not taken issue with it
@entity8 , 59 , joined the @entity27 case nine months after she was found killed in her parents ' basement *alongside* a ransom note in 1996
he said the case was mishandled because of a lack of staff over @entity55 ; he added that the parents should have been interviewed immediately
he also described the *peculiarities* of the case , such as how the murder was staged as a kidnapping , and how the @entity244 made their job even harder
