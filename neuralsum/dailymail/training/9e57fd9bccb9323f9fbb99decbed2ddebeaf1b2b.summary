by @entity0 rusty the red panda 's escape from a @entity4 zoo last month has prompted a new plan to inspect trees , bushes and other vegetation around every exhibit at the @entity10			1
an investigation determined @entity12 likely climbed out through the trees in his exhibit			1
now the limbs have been cut back , and the zoo has two cameras aimed at the red panda yard around the clock			1
walkabout : @entity12 the red panda , pictured , went missing from the zoo in @entity4 in june according to a zoo report on the escape obtained by @entity0 following a public records request , the zoo has been investigating and observing @entity12 ever since he was found in a nearby @entity4 neighborhood june 24			1
the report was filed with the @entity29 , an accrediting body			0
the zoo 's investigation found @entity12 likely escaped late june 23 or early june 24 through tree limbs hanging low in his exhibit after a rain			1
no red panda tracks were found outside the exhibit , the report noted , so the exact route of his escape could n't be determined			1
animal keepers have kept watch on @entity12 's activity by day and night as an extra precaution			1
he returned to his public exhibit july 9 and spent the night outside for the first time monday night with two keepers on duty to observe his behavior			2
home : @entity12 , pictured , returned from his trip to the @entity51 neighborhood and went back to his enclosure ( pictured getting a check up in june ) nothing seemed out of the ordinary , a spokeswoman said			1
' we identified and solved the problem that allowed @entity12 to get out , ' the report noted			2
as of july 1 , ' we are confident that the exhibit can contain him			2
' the incident prompted the zoo to begin regular checks of all vegetation around enclosures to ensure animal containment is secure			2
there has been increased trimming throughout the zoo , said spokeswoman @entity71			0
the @entity73 @entity72 sent an inspector to the zoo following the escape , and a copy of the brief inspection report was provided to the @entity0 on june 27 , veterinarian @entity79 found ' an appropriate corrective action plan ' had been developed following the escape			1
@entity12 was born in july 2012 at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 found : @entity85 took this picture of @entity12 scurrying in the bushes and tweeted it to the zoo with a note saying ' red panda in our neighborhood			1
please come save him ! ' he was transferred to the @entity10 in april under breeding recommendations from the zoos association			2
he was moved into his exhibit in june after time in quarantine			2
less than a month later , the young , curious male was found exploring his new city in the @entity51 neighborhood			0
residents snapped pictures of him along sidewalks and homes before zoo keepers cornered him in a tree and snagged him a net nearly ¾ of a mile from the zoo			0
following the escape , the zoo has removed bamboo — a favorite food for red pandas — around the red panda exhibit			1
the plants had grown high and likely helped create a ' vegetative bridge ' out of the enclosure			0
the idea of a snack may have drawn @entity12 out for a treat , the report noted			2
' horticulture staff regularly trim vegetation in animal habitats to make sure containment is not compromised , ' said @entity71 , the zoo 's spokeswoman			1
' in this case , zoo staff underestimated the growth brought about by perfect weather conditions ( weeks of consistent rain )			0
' @entity133 : officials at the zoo , pictured , sounded the ' @entity137 ' alert for an escaped animal when they noticed @entity12 missing in june @entity140 lines that carry an electric current in the enclosure also were assessed and upgraded			1
a new visitor wall was added to create more tree - free space			0
according to the @entity29 guidelines for red pandas , enclosures must be created with the species ' mobility in mind			0
' red pandas are excellent climbers , but poor jumpers , so dry - moated enclosures contain them well , ' according to an excerpt from the association 's manual in the zoo 's report			1
' do not let the branches of climbing trees overhang the boundary fence			0
' it has n't been determined if hotwire is an effective barrier , but it is sometimes used to keep wildlife from entering the exhibit			0
@entity140 should be considered a secondary barrier , according to the zoo association			0
the @entity10 uses hotwire throughout the zoo as a deterrent in conjunction with walls , fences or other barriers , @entity71 said			2
unlike giant pandas , red pandas are not members of the bear family			0
they are slightly larger than a domestic cat and look similar to a raccoon			0
red pandas are vulnerable in the wild and are native to @entity186			0
scientists believe about 10,000 of them remain .			0
