by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 11 july 2012 a schoolgirl was left with a badly swollen face after suffering a terrifying allergic reaction to her sunglasses on holiday			1
@entity7 ’s head , eyes and nose ballooned in size , leaving her features so distorted that even her parents did n’t recognise her			1
doctors said she - and her friend , who was also wearing a pair of similar glasses - had both suffered severe allergic reactions and confirmed plastic in the sunglasses was the most likely cause			1
before and after : the teenager , pictured left , enjoying her holiday in @entity24 , unaware of the damage to her face caused by the sunglasses , right after seeking urgent medical treatment in @entity31 , the distraught teenager 's parents booked their daughter on the next flight back to the @entity34 for further hospital treatment			1
now she wants to warn other holidaymakers about the perils of buying and wearing cheap sunglasses			1
@entity7 , from @entity40 , @entity39 said : ‘ it was supposed to be a holiday to celebrate finishing our a levels			1
it was the first time we ’d ever been abroad without our parents but it was totally ruined by a pair of £ 1 sunglasses			1
i honestly thought i would die			2
i was sick and dizzy and everyone was staring at me because i looked like i ’d been badly beaten up			2
@entity7 suffered the extreme reaction to the pair of sunglasses whilst celebrating the end of her exams in @entity24 with her sister and friend ‘ i did n’t understand what was happening to me in the hospital so i begged mum and dad to get us home			1
‘ i was worried i would never look normal again			2
’ the drama started when @entity7 , her twin sister @entity64 , and a college pal flew to @entity24 on june 28th this year			1
@entity7 , who said she ended up looking like a character from @entity67 , pictured after the swelling had gone down after a day by the pool wearing her new shades , which she had purchased from a @entity72 shop , @entity7 felt her forehead was starting to burn			1
‘ i thought it was the heat so put more sun cream on even though i had been wearing factor 30 already , ’ she explains			2
it was the next day that horrified @entity7 noticed her head and eyes were starting to swell			1
‘ i did n’t know what was happening			0
i ’ve been to sunny places before so i knew it was n’t the heat			0
' i looked ( like ) a freak			0
my friend ’s head was swelling too			2
’ but not realising the glasses were to blame , @entity7 and her friend kept wearing them because they were so ashamed of the way they looked			1
when that night her friend complained her throat was swelling , panicking @entity7 called an ambulance			1
‘ they gave her an injection which helped her swelling go down , but refused to treat me because i was n’t the patient , ’ said @entity7			1
but by next morning , with her face now twice it ’s usual size , @entity7 found a local doctor to inject her with an anti-inflammatory for 50 euros			1
‘ he said it would go down but back at the hotel it was getting worse and worse			0
i sent mum and dad a picture and they did n’t recognise me			0
’ soon it was so bad @entity7 could barely see out of her eyes			1
it was then she started to suspect the sunglasses were to blame			2
‘ my twin was ok and she was the only one without the glasses			0
i knew it had to be them			0
‘ i looked like a different person , like i had been badly beaten up			0
' i knew i had to get to hospital and was starting to seriously panic about what was happening to me			0
plastic sunglasses , such as those worn by @entity7 , contain dyes and waxes which may cause allergic reactions in some			1
a combination of materials , such as zyl or propionate , as well as nylon and polyamides can , in rare cases , also lead to irritation of the skin			0
allergic reactions to plastic sunglasses remain rare , however , but medical experts have warned of other dangers in wearing cheap shades			1
the sunglasses do not always offer adequate protection from harmful uv rays and wearers may be putting their sight at risk			2
too much exposure to such rays can damage the retina and lens of the eye - causing irreversible damage			0
‘ they told us to keep putting cold water on the swellings but when it became clear nothing was working i was desperate to get home			0
' i did n’t want to die in @entity31 over a pair of sunglasses			2
‘ i called my parents in tears and they booked us all on the next flight			2
’ they were waiting at @entity173 airport to meet them off the plane and rush @entity7 straight to hospital			2
mother @entity177 broke down when she saw her girl			0
‘ my mum could n’t believe it was me			0
' i looked like one of those avatars from the film			0
she was crying and i was crying			0
’ they drove straight to @entity185 in @entity186			0
doctors confirmed she had suffered a severe allergic reaction to the sunglasses and prescribed a course of antihistamines			1
the swelling is now starting to go down			0
but @entity7 said she has been left devastated after her holiday insurance did not cover her £ 470 holiday or the early flight home			1
‘ they ruined my holiday and looks - i thought i was getting a bargain for £ 1 but they cost me a fortune			0
as a student i ca n’t afford another holiday			0
‘ do n’t buy them , it ’s not worth it			0
