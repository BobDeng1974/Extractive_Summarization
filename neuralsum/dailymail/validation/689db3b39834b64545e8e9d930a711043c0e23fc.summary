@entity1 electric - powered cars are much more dangerous to pedestrians than traditional vehicles with petrol engines , a charity report said yesterday			1
it found that walkers are 40 per cent more likely to be run over by a quiet hybrid or electric car than by one with a petrol or diesel engine			1
and as the number of green vehicles grows because of @entity19 tax breaks for eco-friendly cars , the number of injuries they cause has been rising fast , it said			2
the charity – which says that guide dog owners and their animals are particularly at risk from vehicles that they can not hear coming – called for laws to make noise generating systems compulsory on all hybrids			1
guide dogs manager @entity43 said : ‘ quiet vehicles put pedestrians at risk outside schools , in residential areas and in our towns and cities			0
' the government is spending hundreds of millions of pounds to increase the numbers of quiet cars on the roads , and while we support the development of environmentally friendly vehicles , more needs to be done to protect pedestrian safety			2
’ the call for legislation was backed with a survey carried out by @entity64 which found more than three quarters thought hybrids make the roads less safe for blind or partially - sighted pedestrians			0
similar proportions thought quiet green cars are a threat to older people and to children			2
electric cars and hybrids running under electric power move silently and are likely to surprise people on foot who expect to hear the approach of a vehicle			1
the visually impaired are among the worst affected by the switch to electric as guide dogs also struggle to identify the threat , with campaigners calling for noise generators to be made compulsory car builders and independent companies have been working on a range of artificial sound generators that would lessen the risk of accidents			1
most involve speakers fixed to the car , which work in the direction the car is moving to reduce nuisance to people who are not in the way			0
sounds promoted vary from a reproduction of the whine of an old electric motor through computerised squawks to a rumble reminiscent of a diesel or petrol combustion engine			2
@entity108 rules say such generators must be fitted to quiet cars by 2021 , but @entity30 said that before then there will be thousands more potentially dangerous green cars on the road			1
it said that car makers should ‘ do the right thing and fit sound generating systems to quiet vehicles before it becomes compulsory			0
’ legislation in @entity121 should also insist that noise - making equipment is not only fitted to a car but always switched on , @entity30 said			1
the charity ’s campaign was supported by @entity127 sprinter @entity126			0
miss @entity126 , who has only peripheral vision , said : ‘ i rely on being able to hear cars to judge when it is safe to cross the road			0
‘ it is terrifying to cross when you are unable to hear quiet hybrid and electric vehicles			0
ensuring all quiet vehicles have sound generating systems installed and switched on would ensure that millions of people , like me , who are living with sight loss , would be protected from the growing safety hazard			0

was a 54 per cent jump in accidents involving the cars from 2012 to 2013
visually impaired are among the worst affected , @entity30 report finds
campaigners are calling for compulsory noise generators on electric cars
