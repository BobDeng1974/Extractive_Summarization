by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 22 march 2013 a new £ 545 million hospital built under the controversial @entity3 scheme has run out of beds , forcing bosses to re-open wards on the the hospital it replaced			1
unprecedented demand on @entity11 admissions at @entity12 means two wards will be brought back into action at the neighbouring old @entity12 , which was built in the 1930s and closed in 2010			1
the building had stood empty before the overcrowding crisis hit and was not expected to receive patients again			0
the move is highly embarrassing given that the new state - of - the - art hospital is the second biggest @entity3 in the @entity21 , and the second biggest in the @entity22			1
too small : the @entity12 , @entity12 , where the unprecedented demand on @entity11 admissions is forcing health bosses to reopen old wards after running out of beds the old queen elizabeth hospital , @entity12 , which closed in 2010			1
patients will now be treated in the 1930s building after the new £ 545m hospital ran out of room @entity3 schemes were a key part of the @entity36 government 's modernisation programme for hospitals			1
under the schemes , private firms paid for the building of new hospitals , with trusts repaying them over 30 or more years , with interest			0
but due to the nature of the deals , the ultimate total cost is often far more than the value of the assets			0
taxpayers have been left with a crippling £ 60billion repayment bill for hospitals built under the private finance initiative – leaving many trusts facing major financial difficulties			2
trusts also agreed to pay firms for maintenance of the properties , meaning the firms can charge exorbitant sums as there can be no competition			0
previous examples include hospitals having to shell out £ 242 just to change a padlock and £ 13,704 to install three lights			0
but @entity22 bosses in @entity12 have been forced to act after elective surgery for routine operations had to be cancelled because of the capacity problems			1
the move comes despite the fact the trust has already laid on 117 additional beds over the winter period			0
@entity12 ’s biggest hospital opened on june 10 with 1,213 beds , replacing two outdated buildings , including the old @entity79			1
royal seal of approval : the hospital was officially named by the queen when she visited @entity12 during her 2012 @entity84 celebrations the hospital , where the @entity79 greeted members of the public , was @entity12 's first new acute hospital for 70 years when it began receiving patients in 2010 the finance behind the project came from @entity91 , which is part of the construction firm @entity93 , a key player in @entity3 schemes			1
the contract lasts for 40 years from the date of financial close – when all legal matters were agreed – which was in june 2006			0
the new hospital , in @entity100 , may also be a victim of its own success , as patients from the region travel to the widely - praised facility in preference to local clinics			1

@entity142 , chief executive of @entity142 which runs the hospital , said it needed to reopen the old wards ' to meet the unprecedented demand on services across the region and , in particular , on the new queen elizabeth hospital '			1
she said the @entity21 had seen a 10 per cent increase in admissions to accident and emergency departments			0
dame @entity153 said the trust was ' proactively responding to a steep rise in the number of @entity157 , self - presenting patients and emergency admissions '			2
speaking on @entity160 , she said : ' we ’ve seen the biggest number of patients coming in since we ’ve been keeping records			2
' we ’ve got an ageing population , people with chronic disease , people are living longer and we ’ve had the winter period			1
' we ’re seeing far , far more patients than we did have			0
clearly we built the new hospital because the old hospitals did n’t meet the standards of the 21st century			1
' what we ’re not doing is looking after patients in corridors , but this way they ’re in a proper ward environment			0
' she said the refitted wards would meet ' the highest ' infection - control standards			1
the new @entity12 was @entity12 ’s first new acute hospital for 70 years when it began receiving patients in 2010			1
@entity36 launched its 2010 general election manifesto at the new site , which was officially named by the @entity79 when she visited @entity12 during her 2012 @entity84 celebrations			1
the parts of the old hospital that will be re-opened will be next to the new buildings			2
so far 52 beds have been opened in the most modern part of the old hospital building.but two wards of 36 beds each will this week be opened in the older part of the building , which was built between built between 1933 and 1934			1
but the trust says it has seen a 20 per cent increase in patients coming in to the hospital and has ' completely filled ' the new @entity79			2
@entity142 said it needed to re-open the old wards ' to meet the unprecedented demand on services across the region ' the trust the said the refitted wards would meet ' the highest ' infection - control standards when the new building first opened , the hospital ’s accident and emergency department would receive around 30 or 40 patients on a typical saturday			1
in recent weeks , that figure has reached 120			0
other methods of dealing with increased patient numbers , including commissioning treatment from the private sector , have already been tried			0
and the @entity142 has also suspended its policy of keeping a single ward in the new hospital empty at any given moment , for refurbishment and cleaning			0
the aim was to ensure that every ward was redecorated and deep cleaned on a regular basis , to reduce the rate of hospital acquired infections			0
but could only be done while the ward was empty of patients , and the hospital is now being forced to keep all its wards open permanently , creating an extra 36 beds			1
the trust has now reluctantly taken the decision to re-open two wards , one for men and one for women , in part of the old hospital known as @entity238			2
a spokesman for @entity142 said : ' the trust is proactively responding to a steep rise in the number of @entity157 , self - presenting patients and emergency admissions			0
' this rise has impacted on elective surgery and rather than see operations cancelled we are increasing capacity to ensure we can continue to deliver timely care to the people who come to us for our quality interventions and expertise			0
unprecedented demand : the old hospital ( pictured ) is needed as the @entity22 is unable to cope with a massive increase in demand for treatment , caused partly by the region 's aging population ' the region has seen a 10 per cent increase in @entity11 attendances in the first quarter of the year			1
@entity142 is seeing 65 per cent of this figure			0
' the spokesman insisted there was no cause for concern about hygiene or patient safety			0
' the trust ’s stringent policies on infection prevention and control are implemented across the entire hospital site by staff who are trained to uphold standards that have the patient ’s safety and hygiene at the centre of everything we do			0
the two wards being opened will be configured and equipped to ensure the highest level of hygiene			2
' @entity3 projects have been embroiled in controversy for a number of years			2
another hospital , the @entity288 and @entity289 was completed in 200 , but faced hundreds of job cuts as it sought to balance its books , and just last month it was announced that a state - of - the - art police station is to cost taxpayers a total of £ 21million over the next 30 years , even though it is closed to the public			1
the front desk at the station , which opened 11 years ago in a 30 - year private finance deal , is shut to save costs , and has been replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight - hours - a - week			1
but police are still committed to handing over £ 700,000 - a - year for the station at @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , in the finance deal until 2031			2
the total cost for the building , which provides a home for the force 's hi - tech @entity315 and the @entity317 for the @entity319 area , will be £ 21m - almost 10 times the cost of building the station .			2

@entity12 's new queen elizabeth hospital officially opened last year
1,213 bed hospital is the second biggest in @entity3 scheme in the @entity22
replaced the old *840* - bed hospital built in the 1930s which closed in 2010
bosses say old wards need to be reopened to meet the ' unprecedented demand on services across the region , including the ageing population '
