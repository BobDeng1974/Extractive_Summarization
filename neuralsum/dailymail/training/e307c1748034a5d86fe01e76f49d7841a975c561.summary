@entity0 insists there have been no inquiries since the transfer window opened , and player , manager and club have all continued to state unequivocally that @entity2 is going nowhere this month			1
@entity2 ' form this season has been attracting interest from a host of @entity8 clubs @entity2 scored his sixth goal of the season in @entity1 's defeat of fellow strugglers @entity31 at the weekend but , with the striker out of contract in the summer and having so far declined to sign a new deal , the speculation is certain to continue			1

' he 's quite demanding of himself , almost too demanding			2
i 've told him to smile and relax and enjoy what he 's doing , and that seems to work with him			2
his thirst to improve is there for all to see			0
' it 's an ongoing negotiation , like it is with a lot of players			2
we get on well with his agent , and that 's an important thing as well			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 is not worried that @entity2 will be affected by the speculation over his future ' everyone knows where it is and that 's always been the case			1
we try and be open and honest in our dealings with players and we 've certainly been that with him			0
where it takes us , we 'll see			0
' we 're quite secure			0
the good side of not spending millions and millions of pounds - we 've spent a few quid by @entity1 standards , but not by the @entity8 market - is that we 're in a good place financially			1
' we 're not under any questions of any of our players going out of the building			0
we 're looking to recruit ones that can come in and help us to move forward			0

the @entity1 moved out of the relegation zone with a hard - fought 2 - 1 victory over @entity31 last weekend and face another close rival , @entity88 , on saturday			1
@entity0 has stuck with broadly the same team all season and named an identical side for six games in a row over @entity94 and @entity95			1
he said : ' with the run over @entity94 and the amount of games we played there , the same team was operating two and three days apart			0
@entity13 will get a chance to run the rule over @entity2 in their @entity83 replay on wednesday ' the team we put out against @entity13 last time was the strongest team we could field because of injury and illness			1
that will be the same again			0
it 's nothing to do with overthinking the games around us			2
' we want to win the game			0
we 've had a nice little run of performances and we 've been getting rewards from our performances			0
' but the team 's not just rolled out , i can assure you			2
there 's a lot of work goes into each performance and a lot of detail to make sure they have the best chance to go and operate again			2
' we know the physical stats , the training volume			0
so if someone we think is really on the edge of their physical capacity , then there 'll be a decision to make			0
so far they 've been really good with it			0
' @entity138 ( left ) is hoping to get back in the team following a goal scoring return from injury one player hoping to be given a chance at @entity81 will be striker @entity138 , who returned from a long - term knee injury last month and scored his first goal against @entity13 to earn @entity1 the replay			1
