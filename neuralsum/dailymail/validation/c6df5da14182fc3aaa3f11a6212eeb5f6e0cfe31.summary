searching for clues to the recent decline of @entity2 , the break - in that occurred at his house in january can not be overlooked			1
@entity6 ’s form had dropped off before that , true , but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks			1
he was n’t getting hooked at half - time before this event			0
@entity10 suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family ’s love for their new country			0
he was not the same player after it happened			0
@entity6 is believed to be relocating his family to a new , high - level apartment following their traumatic experience			2
@entity2 has seen his form drop off in recent months and has been substituted in the last few games @entity6 has been replaced in @entity26 's last two @entity25 games @entity10 had a tough time at @entity28 and left for @entity29 @entity10 has returned to @entity30 on loan with @entity29 the player would not be human if he was unaffected , particularly as - like @entity10 - he is still learning to speak @entity33 and must already feel quite alone			1
@entity28 came to the conclusion that @entity10 was lost to them , and only a return to @entity30 would solve his problems			0
@entity26 may decide this is also the case with @entity6 — but have so much more to lose , financially , if he departs at the end of the season .			2

@entity2 has failed to live up to his early season form
@entity6 was substituted against both @entity44 and @entity45
@entity6 's house was broken into at the beginning of the year
