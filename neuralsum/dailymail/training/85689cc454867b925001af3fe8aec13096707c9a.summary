by @entity0 content : @entity2 insists she 's happy at her home , despite it being the scene of a murder a mother whose back garden once contained the bodies of a murdered couple has spoken of her profound shock at the discovery of their remains , saying that she ' went to pieces '			1
@entity2 and her 15 - year - old daughter live at a property in @entity17 where @entity18 and @entity19 shot and killed @entity21 and @entity20 – @entity18 ’s parents – in 1998 and buried the bodies under the lawn			1
they remained a macabre secret until 2013 , with ms @entity2 a resident since 2006			1
ms @entity2 described how she was horrified when @entity27 detectives phoned her at work in october last year and told her about their grim discovery - of remains buried three feet beneath her lawn			1
she said : ‘ it was terrible			0
i came home and all these people arrived in white suits			2
i 've lost track of what happened , i was so emotional			0
’ but although the unearthing of the remains proved a huge shock to ms @entity2 , she insists she ’ll be perfectly happy to stay at the house			1
she told the @entity44 : ‘ a lot of people have said , “ how can you possibly still live there ? ” ’ ‘ but i love our home			2
we have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times here			2
‘ i have lived here all this time and the @entity55 have not done me any harm			0
they are not going to do my any harm now			0
i am going to stay			0
’ ms @entity2 said she ‘ never really thought anything ’ of the area in her garden where grass would not grow , where it would later emerge the @entity55 had been buried			1
‘ we used to have birthday parties in the garden , which my young nieces and nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area			2
my nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and i just think , “ how close , how close ”			0
’ ms @entity2 spoke out as the @entity19 , who successfully hid their crime for 16 years , were sentenced to life in prison for the murders and unlawful burials of @entity21 , 85 and 63 - year - old @entity20			1
for years , @entity18 , 56 , and @entity19 , 57 , kept claiming the @entity55 ' benefits , stealing £ 245,000 from them , and conning friends and relatives that they were still alive			1
the @entity19 , who were found guilty of murder last week , have to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars , a judge at @entity82 ruled			1
sentencing the pair , mrs justice @entity86 said the @entity19 had created ‘ an elaborate charade ’ which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the @entity55			1
the court heard that the debt - ridden couple shot their victims at their home in @entity17 on the may bank holiday , with the couple then buried in a metre - deep hole in their own back garden			1
for the next 15 years , the couple kept up the elaborate hoax that mr @entity119 , 85 , and his 63 - year - old wife were alive			0
the debt - ridden pair made it appear as though the ‘ reclusive ’ @entity124 were still alive and had simply moved away , faking their signatures on official documents , and sending @entity128 cards and letters apparently from them to family members			0
as a result , they were able to rake in almost £ 250,000 in pensions , credit , and the sale of the @entity119 ’s home - much of which celebrity - obsessed @entity18 , who also felt her parents had ‘ swindled ’ her out of a £ 10,000 inheritance in the 1970s , spent on correspondence signed by her favourite stars			1
the 56 - year - old was fixated with powerful older men - including @entity147 actors @entity145 and @entity148 , legendary football manager @entity149 , entertainer @entity150 , and political giants @entity151 and general @entity153			0
behind bars : @entity18 and @entity19 have been sentenced to life in prison evidence : police believe this second world war commando colt .38 calibre revolver was used in the murders in @entity27 in 1998 their elaborate plot did not begin to unravel until 2012 when the @entity161 of the @entity162 wrote to mr @entity119 , who would have been approaching his 100th birthday , and asked for a face - to - face meeting			1
the @entity19 panicked and fled their council home in @entity167 , @entity168 , to @entity169 in northern @entity170 , renting a flat which they paid for in cash			1
@entity19 , who could speak fluent @entity170 , attempted to find work but was unsuccessful			1
revelations : the judge accepted accusations from mrs @entity178 that her father , @entity119 ( pictured ) had abused her by october last year , they were fast running out of cash			0
in desperation , @entity19 , 57 , called his stepmother , @entity178 , back in the @entity184 to ask for money – then told her the stunning revelation that the @entity55 were buried in their garden			1
he also gave her the version of events that @entity178 should stick to during their police interviews and trial - but she called the police as soon as the conversation finished			0
stunned detectives then made the grim discovery of the @entity20 ’s remains and contacted @entity19 using phone numbers and an email address he had given his stepmother			2
he eventually replied and arranged to return to the @entity184 , and the couple were arrested at @entity202 railway station a month after the @entity55 were unearthed			0
the only possessions the @entity19 , who had just one @entity205 left to their name , brought back was a suitcase full of celebrity memorabilia			2
included were five items of correspondence signed by the 1950s film star @entity148 , which @entity18 had splashed out more than £ 14,000 on during 2009 and 2011			2
it was a sign of @entity18 ’s obsession with celebrities , a fascination which the court heard even extended to writing hundreds letters to herself posing as the @entity170 actor @entity145			2
the fake 14 - year correspondence , between 1992 and 2006 , even deceived her own husband , with @entity18 acquiring a machine to make it seem as though the letters had a @entity170 postmark			2
despite stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds owed to the @entity55 , including selling their home complete with its macabre secret for £ 66,000 in 2005 , the @entity19 remain deep in debt , owing around £ 160,000 to creditors			1
sentencing the couple on monday , mrs @entity229 described the killings as ‘ shocking crimes ’			0
she told the ‘ self - contained couple ’ that so far as they were concerned ‘ only the two of you mattered ’			0
the judge told @entity239 , who sat staring intently from the dock wearing a patterned grey cardigan and glasses , that she was ‘ an accomplished liar and a fantasist ’			0
mrs @entity229 accepted ‘ on balance ’ that she had told the truth about being sexually abused by mr @entity119 as a child and that had formed the basis of the hatred she felt for her father			0
‘ that background may explain why you hated him , which you did , and why you have no remorse about killing him , ’ she said			0
the judge said she did not believe mrs @entity20 had ever known of that abuse , as had been claimed in court as being the motive for killing her .			0
