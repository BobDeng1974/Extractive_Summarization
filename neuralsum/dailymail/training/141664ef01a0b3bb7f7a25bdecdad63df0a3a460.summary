mps also said he must not allow himself to be shouted down by ‘ aggressive ’ atheists who want faith to be cut out of politics and national life			1
@entity2 faced criticism after calling @entity7 a @entity6 country but faith leaders and his own mps have rallied around him in support the prime minister came under fire after a group of celebrity atheists said he was wrong to declare @entity7 a ‘ christian country ’			1
their open letter said @entity7 is not a ‘ christian country ’ and argued that most members of the public ‘ do not want religions or religious identities to be actively prioritised by their elected government ’			1
the letter , signed by more than 50 celebrities , scientists and academics , including the authors @entity44 and sir @entity46 and tv presenter @entity47 , also accused the @entity26 of sowing ‘ alienation and division ’ and fuelling ‘ sectarian divides ’			1
but the claims were rubbished by mps along with @entity7 faith leaders from the @entity6 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity57 communities yesterday			1
senior tory @entity58 , chairman of the cross-party group @entity61 in @entity62 , urged the pm to face down his atheist critics			0
he said : ‘ these people say it is offensive to say @entity7 is a @entity6 country , but offensive to who ? other religious groups welcome the fact we are talking about faith			1
’ @entity71 , the former archbishop of @entity72 , said that to claim @entity7 was not a @entity6 country was to ‘ ignore historical and constitutional reality ’			1
here are some of the 55 public figures who signed a letter accusing @entity2 of fostering ‘ alienation ’ by emphasising @entity6 @entity81 author , pictured , received hate mail for his book , @entity83 but said he was ‘ trying to undermine the basis of @entity6 belief ’			1
@entity88 former @entity87 presenter is said to believe that religion has ‘ enslaved and crushed as many as it has enlightened ’			0
@entity90 suffering from @entity91 ’s , the author supports legalising assisted death , but his documentary on the subject was criticised by religious leaders as ‘ propaganda ’			0
@entity100 letter ’s lead signatory , the @entity102 born physicist and author is current president of the @entity105			0

@entity118 television historian was married by @entity119 , @entity120 , in 2012 – but said he was allowed to ‘ take @entity121 out of my vows ’			0
he said : ‘ where do @entity2 ’s critics think our constitution , ethics and establishment come from ? ’ he added that as a @entity6 country , @entity7 had ‘ ensured the freedom of all religious and non-religious voices to be heard ’ whereas a secularist establishment would ‘ inhibit ’ them			1
he compared @entity7 to @entity135 , where ‘ secularism in practice ’ has seen the ‘ illiberal banning of some forms of religious dress and the suppression of religious voices in public debate ’			2
@entity144 , of the @entity145 , said : ‘ no one can deny that @entity7 remains largely a @entity6 country , with deep historical and structural links with the established @entity149			1
the 2011 census indicates that more than 60 per cent of the @entity152 self - identify as @entity6			2
’ lord @entity154 , of the @entity155 , said : ‘ @entity6 is the religion of the majority			2
it is not the greatest sin to say this			0
what is of greater concern is the letter in response , which says we are not a religious country			2
’ @entity167 , of the @entity168 , said he was ‘ grateful ’ for @entity6 ’s inclusive attitude towards other religions and pointed out that many @entity7 hindus even celebrated christian holidays			1
‘ i attend the @entity173 service at @entity174 each year , ’ he added			0
‘ i gave my nieces and family @entity176 on saturday			0
many @entity55 celebrate @entity178 , although they do not go to church , because they are living in @entity7			2

’ in 2008 , mr @entity2 likened his faith to the reception of radio station @entity185 in the @entity186 , saying it ‘ comes and goes ’			1
but earlier this week , he said that he believed @entity7 should be more ‘ evangelical ’ about @entity6 and ‘ more confident about our status as a @entity6 country ’			1
in an article for the @entity191 , he argued that some atheists and agnostics did not understand that faith could be a ‘ guide or a helpful prod ’ towards morality			2
it was this intervention that prompted yesterday ’s letter – signed by 55 atheist public figures – denouncing his language and accusing him of ‘ fostering alienation and division ’			0
@entity205 ’s former spin doctor @entity204 went further by suggesting that mr @entity2 was faking the extent of his religious belief in a cynical ‘ tactic ’ to distract attention away from the resignation of culture secretary @entity211			2
mr @entity204 – who famously barred journalists from asking mr @entity205 about his faith – said : ‘ like so much of what he does it feels like a tactic in search of a strategy			0
’ but @entity220 mp @entity219 said mr @entity2 was ‘ brave ’ to take on the atheists			2
