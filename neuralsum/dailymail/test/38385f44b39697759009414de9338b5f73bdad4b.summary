mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children , researchers claim			1
a study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause			1
researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in @entity17			1
children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone , the study showed ( file picture ) they measured factors such as the adult ’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed			1
the researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head - first			1
children whose carers were distracted were ‘ significantly ’ more likely to behave in this way			1
the researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head - first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘ significantly ’ more likely to behave in this way electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions			1
three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt			1
study author @entity48 , of @entity49 in @entity17 , called on gadget - obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring , saying : ‘ increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered			1
’ a neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work professor @entity65 warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget - filled , pharmaceutically - enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains , we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro - chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines , and between our bodies and the outside world			1
electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work , according to a neuroscientist she said : ' one vital fact i have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine			2
' it not only goes on developing , changing and , in some tragic cases , eventually deteriorating with age , it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life			0
when i say " shaped " , i 'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically ; i 'm talking literally			0
at a microcellular level , the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli			0
' the brain , in other words , is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood , and , in certain instances , beyond			2
the surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind			0
of course , there 's nothing new about that : human brains have been changing , adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries			0
but in the last century , development of new technologies has increased dramatically			0
' this will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined , ' she said			0
' our brains are under the influence of an ever - expanding world of new technology : multichannel television , video games , mp3 players , the internet , wireless networks , @entity136 links - the list goes on and on			2
' this games - driven generation interpret the world through screen - shaped eyes			2
it 's almost as if something has n't really happened until it 's been posted on @entity143 , @entity144 or @entity145			0
' we could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer - generated moment , and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world			2
' ' electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains			0
and that , in turn , affects our personality , our behaviour and our characteristics			0
in short , the modern world could well be altering our human identity			0

researchers observed random parents with children at @entity17 playgrounds
phones and tablets were a dangerous distraction for parents , they claimed
kids with distracted carers were more likely to engage in risky behaviour
this *included* jumping off moving swings or going head - first down slides
