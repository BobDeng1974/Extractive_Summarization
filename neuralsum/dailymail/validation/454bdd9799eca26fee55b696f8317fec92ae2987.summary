there is no place in @entity3 ’s mindset for a soppy nod to his old allegiances			0
he let out a roar of relief , a leap of joy and a pumped fist of celebration after lashing home the key goal that condemned former club @entity15 to a defeat that could damage their hopes of avoiding relegation — and helped @entity21 draw menacingly level on points with his boyhood heroes @entity26			1
@entity3 ’s superb strike was the essential response to the visitors drawing level through @entity31 and sparked a three - goal flurry in the final seven minutes that saw @entity21 claim a first @entity35 victory since january 3			1
@entity3 led @entity21 to a 4 - 1 victory over @entity15 at @entity35 on saturday @entity21 ' @entity37 celebrates his second goal during the @entity40 match at @entity35 @entity21 ' @entity41 and @entity15 's @entity42 fight for the ball during the @entity40 match the gloss finish was provided by super sub @entity37 , who produced the other two late strikes			1
@entity21 may have been landed with the worst - value loan deal in football history by former directors @entity51 and @entity52 sanctioning the signings of four @entity55 fringe players who have been ill or unfit			1
but on this form — with five goals in nine appearances — the new regime wo n’t be in a hurry to disentangled themselves from the deal that sees @entity37 here until the end of a season which now features a scrap for the most advantageous play - off positions			0
@entity21 looked in no kind of shape to contend with @entity3 ’s childhood favourites @entity26 for that runners - up berth three weeks ago when they last faced @entity15			1
a scoreless shocker at @entity73 was one of the most insipid @entity21 displays of the past three seasons			1
the wind and churned pitch were offered up as mitigating factors following that dire effort , but there were no excuses here as a team revitalised by @entity84 to gain a first win in six last sunday at @entity86 sought to build momentum in the spring campaign			1
@entity21 fans celebrated the life of @entity91 in the first home match since the 20th anniversary of the wing wizard ’s death , with tribute banners and songs			2
@entity84 gave the player named after one of the greatest ever @entity35 heroes , @entity99 , a chance to star on the left flank against the strugglers			1
in his first start since january 10 , @entity99 was a marked man			0
@entity105 was booked after 70 seconds for a lunge on the @entity108 man			0
@entity42 soon followed into @entity110 ’s notebook			0
@entity15 's @entity31 scores his first goal of the game during the @entity40 match @entity21 ' @entity37 celebrates his first goal during the @entity40 match at @entity35 @entity37 celebrates his second goal with teammate @entity117 during the @entity40 match that was no discouraging tactic because @entity99 was in the mood for mischief and he did as much as any @entity21 player to tire out the visitors with his trickery			1
@entity21 quickly brushed off a bright start from the visitors that saw @entity126 shut down a @entity128 chance			2
the home side moved the ball around briskly , stretching and asking questions of a @entity15 defence that had leaked 31 times in nine matches			1
@entity135 kept out centre - halves @entity136 and @entity138 with headers from corners			0
@entity141 picked up the scraps of a mazy @entity99 run to carve out a chance that smacked off the far post and fell kindly to the visiting keeper			0
both home strikers @entity147 and @entity149 shot wide when presented with their goes at goal			0
@entity84 could have no complaints about the volume of chances being crafted by his side			1
@entity15 ’s endeavours to stem the tide were overseen by @entity158 , deputising for boss @entity159 who was preparing for @entity161 ’s key qualifier against @entity162 , and he admitted that they rode their luck to go in level at the interval			1
@entity21 needed a helping hand early in the second period and they got one from @entity170 as the away keeper allowed a @entity41 drive squirm from his grasp			2
the penalty - box instincts of @entity147 beat @entity174 on the slide as he bundled the ball over the line just inside the left - hand post for his seventh of the season			0
@entity147 ’s grafting and harrying for the ball was noteworthy as @entity21 strived for a second but the 23 - year - old will have nightmares over his 71st - minute miss. once again , @entity99 tormented down the left and he delivered a devil of a low ball across the face of goal			2
@entity37 could n’t reach it but @entity147 looked to arrive in the nick of time at the back post to provide the finishing touch , but it was the side - netting that rippled from the forward ’s wayward shot			0
@entity149 ’s fresh air header was n’t much better and failure to put the game to bed meant that @entity21 were only one slip away from losing their grip on the contest			2
@entity147 ( left ) scored the first goal for @entity21 in the victory over @entity15 @entity21 ' @entity138 and @entity15 's @entity207 during the @entity40 match at @entity35 @entity141 ( left ) has a shot at goal for @entity21 in the @entity40 match with @entity15 cue the latest @entity136 muddle as his ghastly pass was intercepted by @entity214 , who spied @entity31 in isolation 22 yards out			1
he spun without pressure and took a couple of strides before maintaining his composure and burying a powerful right - foot finish beyond @entity126			0
all the old frailties were in danger of creeping back to bite @entity21 as @entity99 looked to injure himself attempting a clever backheel			2
@entity3 was booked for a cynical foul to stop another @entity15 break and fears of a fourth successive home draw brought scorn from the stands			2
@entity3 calmed those nerves with his third goal for the club , latching on to a loose ball on the edge of the area and lashing a shot into the far corner			0
@entity158 threw caution to the wind in the hunt for another leveller but that played into the hands of @entity37 , whose class exploited the extra space			0
he and the excellent @entity41 produced a terrific exchange of passes to scythe through the remains of the @entity15 defence , culminating in the @entity251 tucking home a neat finish .			0

*rangers* thrash @entity15 in first @entity35 victory since january 3
@entity21 scored three goals in the final seven minutes to take the win
