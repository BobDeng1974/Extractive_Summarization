his ode to nature 's ' mists and mellow fruitfulness ' came from daily walks to a local beauty spot			1
and for years fans of @entity8 have flocked to the @entity10 meadows thought to have inspired his words			2
but new research suggests the real site , which seemed to sum up the joys of @entity16 , is buried under a multi-storey car park			1
eyesore : the car park is run by the local council and its position will disappoint poetry fans how it was : a sketch of the city around the time @entity8 visited in 1819 in a blow to tourists following in the footsteps of @entity30 's best - loved poet , the closest they may get to his scenic ' stubble fields ' is a red - brick eyesore run by @entity34			1
academics at @entity36 made the astonishing discovery after looking at a historic guidebook to the city from around the time @entity8 , a @entity40 , spent a few months there in 1819			1
that is known to be when he composed his ' ode to @entity16 ' , read by generations of schoolchildren			1
it begins : ' season of mists and mellow fruitfulness , close bosom - friend of the maturing sun. ' not so idyllic : the car park in @entity34 that researchers believe stands on the site of meadows that inspired @entity8 to write @entity58 to @entity16 in an engraving showing a panorama of the city centre , they realised a dark area on the side of @entity64 was actually a cornfield - and believe this is actually @entity66 's famous ' reap 'd furrow '			1
months of research revealed that standing from this exact point would explain a number of other references in the poem which have never been accounted for			2
the discovery has been greeted with surprise by tourism officers in the town who currently advise visitors to follow a ' @entity79 ' taking in idyllic meadows by the river			2
more appealing : a nicer view of the city , with the @entity84 winding its way past @entity86 @entity87 , a professor of @entity88 said : ' we looked closely at this engraving and saw the ploughed cornfield on @entity64 , which no - one had noticed before			2
it is now a multi-storey car park			2
' @entity8 fans come flocking every year to the meadows , to swoon at the maturing sun over the scenery , but we believe it is the wrong place			0
he may have written other things there , but not the poem everyone knows him for			0
poet : @entity8 who used @entity34 for inspiration ' we hope to talk to the tourist board about our findings and i think it would be good if they could change the @entity8 walk to take in the real site			1
perhaps they could put up a plaque there to let people know			0
' prof @entity87 and his colleagues say the new location makes sense as this would explain @entity8 reference to a ' hilly gourds ' in the poem			0
it would also explain the sheep he mentions , which were known to be herded there , and the fact his ' maturing sun ' set in the west			0
if he was walking in the meadows outside @entity34 , where there are no hills , he would have seen the sun setting in the east , the researchers said			1
they say it puts a dramatically different spin on the poem , as this land had been publicly - owned but was sold â€“ controversially - to a profiteer landowner named @entity138			0
land leases from @entity140 confirm the sale and that it was a cornfield			0
' it all makes sense now ' , prof @entity87 said			0
' and it makes the poem much more political as the reapers @entity8 mentioned would have been working hard but unable to afford the corn they were harvesting			0
' these were turbulent times , rather like today , and this could be interesting comment on these social changes			0
' @entity153 of the @entity154 said : ' people do self - guided @entity156 from our leaflets and there are some guided ones too , which were developed with advice from our historical experts			0
' we 've always thought @entity8 wrote ' ode ' to @entity16 ' about the water - meadows south of @entity34 , which do exist			1
i 'm not sure how much visitors would want to see a car park but we will have a look into it			0
' @entity171 , head of tourism at @entity34 said : ' we know @entity8 did walk along the meadows and that he wrote the poem after doing that walk so people are not being duped			1
' but it is quite possible that @entity64 was part of the walk , and that 's where these stubble covered fields were			1
' if so , maybe our sunset walk needs re-modelling			0
our historical knowledge is being updated all the time , so this is fascinating and the debate rages on			2
' @entity187 , co-author of the paper to be published in the @entity189 , said : ' @entity34 had something so precious for so long under its feet , but did n't know			1

academics at @entity36 used a guidebook from the time of poet 's visit to @entity34 to trace the area behind @entity58 to @entity16
