by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 05:26 est , 12 november 2012 an influential blogger has launched a new service that posts satellite images of areas hit by @entity6 drone strikes as an @entity8 feed			1
@entity9 posts images drone strike locations from @entity12 view to the popular photo - sharing service along with short summaries of what 's there			1
the online service is the brainchild of @entity20 - based writer @entity19 , who has earned world - wide reknown for his new aesthetic blog which aims to describe how now - ubiquitous computer networks change how we perceive the world			2
@entity9 : the service posts images of the locations of drone strikes from @entity12 view to @entity8 along with short summaries of what 's there he said @entity9 is his way of ' making these locations just a little bit more visible , a little closer			1
on his booktwo.org blog , mr @entity19 added : ' drones are just the latest in a long line of military technologies augmenting the process of death - dealing , but they are among the most efficient , the most distancing , the most invisible			2
' these qualities allow them to do what they do unseen , and create the context for secret , unaccountable , endless wars			0
' whether you think these killings are immoral or not , most of them are by any international standard illegal			0
' with the @entity55 and @entity6 militaries unforthcoming about the activities of their drone fleets , mr @entity19 's @entity8 feed - which is syndicated to @entity52 and twitter - reports records of strikes drawn mainly from the @entity60			1
the @entity60 compiles reports from @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 and , as well as providing the satellite image , @entity9 augments these with a variety of sources to offer more background on the targets hit			1
death from above : a @entity6 predator drone			1
the @entity6 claims that 98 to 99 per cent of its targets are legitimate ; critics claim the reverse is true with civilians making up the bulk of drone strike victims the service is similar to the mooted @entity82 app @entity80 , which would have alerted users whenever a person was killed by a @entity6 drone strike , but was rejected by @entity86			1
the @entity88 tech giant refused to add the program to its app store three times , with it 's latest rejection letter calling the app 's content ' objectionable and crude '			0
the @entity6 military is seeking contractors to build it miniature ' suicide drones ' that can be flown into targets up to six miles away			0
the little planes , which could look like the remote - controlled aircraft used in a more domestic setting , could be used for kamikaze - style attacks on vehicles or buildings - even individuals if necessary			0
the @entity108 wants the weapons , known as the ' @entity110 ' ( @entity110 ) into war by 2016 , and describe the weapon as a ' portable , covert weapon with strike capability against stationary or moving individuals , with a very low risk of collateral damage '			0
the ' plane ' will consist of a drone , warhead and launching device with a maximum weight of less than five pounds			2
the number of casualties caused by @entity6 drone strikes alone has quadrupled under the @entity127 administration , although the ethics of the highly secretive operations was off the agenda during the recent presidential election			1
the @entity6 military claims that between 98 and 99 per cent of those killed by drones are legitimate militant targets , but independent studies claim the overwhelming number of victims are in fact civilians			0
the @entity55 military has , if anything , been even cagier about the use of its drone fleet , although defence minister @entity143 was last week forced to admit that @entity55 reaper drones have fired at 349 @entity146 targets since 2008			2
mr @entity19 points out that means that in that time @entity55 forces have launched one drone strike every four days			2
for mr @entity19 , using @entity8 to highlight the remote areas hit by the drones is just one way in which technology is changing the way we can map the course of history			1
' history , like space , is co-produced by us and our technologies : those technologies include satellite mapping , social photo sharing from handheld devices , and fleets of flying death robots , ' he said			0
' we should engage with them at every level			0
these are just images of foreign landscapes , still ; yet we have got better at immediacy and intimacy online : perhaps we can be better at empathy too			0

drone strikes will be reported as an @entity8 feed syndicated to @entity52 and @entity179
