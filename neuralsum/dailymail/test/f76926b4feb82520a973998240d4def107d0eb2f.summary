the @entity0 are set to steal @entity2 ’s thunder by unveiling tax breaks for workers on the minimum wage			1
a text message intended for a senior aide to @entity8 – but accidentally sent to a newspaper – yesterday divulged plans for a ‘ tax free minimum wage ’			1
the details are unclear , but it is thought this would mean that those on the minimum wage would be exempt from paying any income tax – even if its level is raised in future			1
new plan : the details of @entity8 's leaked plans are unclear , but it is believed to mean that minimum wage earners wouldn ' t be paying any income tax the minimum wage currently stands at £ 6.50 an hour , rising to £ 6.70 in october			1
@entity2 ’s @entity28 yesterday pledged that he would help low earners by raising the level above £ 8 an hour by october 2019			2
but the @entity31 look set to outflank both @entity2 and the @entity32 on the issue of low pay with a firm commitment in their own manifesto , released today			0
@entity38 said in his speech to the @entity31 last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax – currently £ 10,600 – go up to £ 12,500 by april 2020			1
this will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether , while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth £ 500 a year			2
critique : @entity32 said @entity8 ’s spending plans are ' becoming less and less credible ' but if mr @entity38 goes further by also raising the minimum wage – and still keeping everyone on it out of tax – then that would represent a major giveaway			1
tax cuts for the low paid are a priority for the prime minister after promising to raise the inheritance tax threshold and the 40p rate of tax for those on higher incomes			0
a text message from @entity65 intended for the chancellor ’s adviser , @entity66 , read : ‘ @entity68 , have sent you the tax free min wage press notice draft			2
@entity71 asks if you could print for @entity8 in no11 ? ’ @entity71 refers to @entity72 , the chancellor ’s most senior economic adviser			0
the text message ended up being sent to a journalist at @entity76			0
it is thought that it refers to a guarantee that , every time the minimum wage rises , its recipients would be protected from paying any income tax			1
@entity32 , the @entity32 chief secretary to the treasury , said it would be another unfunded spending commitment			0
he added : ‘ @entity8 ’s spending plans are becoming less and less credible by the day , and it ’s embarrassing			2
‘ they now expect the public to believe them when they make unfunded promises with one hand , whilst decimating family budgets and public services with the other			0
’ @entity96 , deputy leader of the @entity2 , said : ‘ the @entity0 are making panicky promises with absolutely no idea how they will pay for them			0
’ mr @entity28 yesterday brought forward by one year his pledge to increase the minimum wage to £ 8			1
he also promised to enforce it more effectively with higher fines for offending firms .			0

@entity8 accidentally divulged plans for a ‘ tax free minimum wage ’
could mean minimum wage earners would *n't* be paying any income tax
follows @entity28 's pledge to raise the minimum wage to £ 8
