@entity0 admits he was wrong to claim @entity1 had been tapped up after the @entity3 defender finally penned a fresh contract with the club			1
talks between the @entity3 and @entity1 had been ongoing for several months , with reported interest from the likes of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 leaving many @entity3 supporters on tenterhooks over the future of their @entity15 international			1
@entity0 said in january that it was ' highly unlikely ' @entity1 had not already verbally agreed to leave @entity17 given that he was yet to sign a new contract and went on to suggest earlier this month that he needed to rope in the questioning techniques of @entity21 from television 's ' 24 ' to get an answer out of the player			1
@entity1 signed a new six - and - a - half year deal @entity3 last week after it appeared he would leave @entity0 had said it was unlikely that @entity1 had not verbally agreed to join another club but the 26 - year - old , who will miss saturday 's trip to @entity11 through injury , has now signed a six - and - a - half - year contract to keep him tied down to the east @entity34 outfit - with @entity0 quick to admit he had misread the situation			1
' i was wrong , so i admit that , ' he said when asked if he was surprised to see @entity1 sign a new deal having questioned whether he had been tapped up			1
' for me , if somebody 's out of contract like that it would have all been done and dusted by the end of the season , even though it might not have been done and dusted from a paperwork point of view			0
' his agent would have sorted out a deal somewhere or other in this country			0
i was probably more concerned about abroad because it could have been a pre-contract			0
the central defender had been linked with the likes of @entity10 and @entity11 before penning new contract ' one of the bigger clubs in @entity53 could have seen what @entity1 has done here and said " he 's the one for us " and taken him abroad so i was obviously wrong			2
' @entity0 believes a strong showing for @entity3 this season would have helped convince @entity1 to stay put - insisting no club bigger than the @entity3 had looked like making a move for his signature			1
' it was the longest negotiation ever , ' he added			0
' i think that in the end both parties are very , very pleased with the outcome			0
i think the big pull for @entity1 signing this time around is that we 've had a good season up until now that we need to finish off as strong as we can			0
@entity1 fights for the ball with @entity10 striker @entity72 during the recent match at @entity74 ' ( we are ) moving to the @entity75 in 2016 , so where else is he going to get bigger than @entity3 ? ' probably because nobody of a greater status than @entity3 has actually taken up his position , he signs up with us , which we 're both delighted about			2
' @entity1 has now been in that position for a considerable amount of time and he now sees @entity3 as the best way forward for him and we 're absolutely delighted with that because it 's been a long , hard negotiation for him			2
' it 's been well into more than a year of trying to come to an agreement in terms of the contract			0
now the contract is secured for a period of time that takes @entity1 along and hopefully the club along to better things			2
