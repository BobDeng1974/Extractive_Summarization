' passing sentence judge @entity114 , @entity115 , described the boy as ' lovely '			0
' this was a child of four , bleeding as he was , screaming as he was , and you shut the door on him			0

' the effects have been devastating , leaving markedly visible scars not to mention serious psychological damage			0
he is frightened of stairs , he sleepwalks , he suffers dreadful nightmares , all because of you			0

' @entity50 not only inflicted a series of horrific injuries on the boy , but also left him for dead on the pavement right outside his flat			1
' thankfully the boy survived the attack and has since recovered but he carries scars both physically and psychologically			2
