whisper any mention of @entity1			2
forget any notion of @entity3			0
only a miracle or a meltdown on the scale of those occasions in 2012 and 1999 can stop @entity8 now			1
captain @entity10 ’s team repelled everything the visitors threw at them during a magnificent @entity15 fightback in the morning to win the afternoon foursomes 3½ - ½ and move to the brink of victory			1
a four - point lead — the same as the @entity15 held at @entity1 and @entity8 had at @entity3 — heading into sunday 's singles is a scenario @entity10 could only have dreamed about on thursday			1
@entity8 had won only two of the previous 11 series in foursomes and fourballs			2
@entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) embrace in celebration as they secure a point for @entity8 in the afternoon foursomes at the @entity31 reunited @entity8 pairing @entity26 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) defeated @entity15 duo @entity32 and @entity33 with two holes to spare @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) celebrate during their @entity31 foursomes victory over @entity32 and @entity33 tight - knit duo @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 support each other as @entity8 stars make their way down the fairway of the second at @entity41 @entity8 's @entity42 plays his approach shot towards the eighth green during their foursomes win on saturday afternoon here they won two more — they never lost a single foursomes match in two sessions — and , with the greater strength in depth and so many proven competitors , it would be a shock of monumental proportions for them not to finish the job off now			1
so many fabulous performances , but @entity59 has undoubtedly been the @entity8 man of the tournament so far			1
he was brilliant by any standard in the morning as he and @entity63 won a match laden with a record number of birdies to become the first @entity8 pair to win their first three games since @entity42 and @entity70 in 2002			1
@entity63 had a tight back and so sat out the afternoon			0
in came @entity72 , with the pair up against the wonderful @entity15 rookies , @entity75 and @entity76			1
what a nerve - wracking occasion this proved			0
@entity8 's @entity59 celebrates with fans at the end of day two after halving his match and ensuring his team 's four - point leading going into the final day @entity84 's @entity83 ( right ) hugs @entity86 's @entity85 after he and @entity72 finished their match against @entity76 and @entity75 all square @entity85 shows what half a point means with a fist pump and a raise of his club to the gallery after draining his putt on the 18th hole @entity72 missed three putts inside 10ft during a four - hole stretch from the 13th			1
@entity75 missed from barely 3ft at the 16th			2
in the end , with four tired players on view , it was wholly appropriate that proceedings on this truly fabulous day should all come down to @entity85 on the final green			2
a 6ft putt for a half to leave @entity8 so close			2
well , you can guess what happened next , ca n’t you ? @entity42 and @entity113 ’s foursomes victory over @entity114 and @entity115 allowed the @entity86 to celebrate a cherished milestone			0
that point , his 23rd achieved over nine @entity31 appearances , meant he went past none other than @entity121 on the all - time list			2
one more point today from the singles would see him go past @entity125 and draw level with @entity127 , leaving him looking up at only sir @entity128 on 25 points			0
that tells you everything about what a fantastic @entity31 player he is and why @entity10 gave him a wild card			0
@entity42 ( right ) clenches his fist on the 16th green at @entity41 after going two - up on @entity15 pair @entity114 and @entity115 @entity141 captain @entity10 congratulates @entity142 @entity113 after he and @entity42 claimed a point in the afternoon foursomes @entity42 won his 23rd @entity31 point in nine appearances to move ahead of @entity8 legend @entity121 on the all - time list @entity42 gets down low to help @entity8 team - mate @entity113 line up a putt on the ninth green there were some eyebrows raised , given the decision left @entity153 on the outside , but even the doubters would surely have to admit now that they were wrong			1
in two foursomes matches the @entity86 and the @entity142 were a combined nine under par and had just two bogeys			0
that ’s tremendous golf by any standards			0
equally good were @entity162 and @entity163			1
@entity10 deserves great credit for taking @entity42 and @entity162 to one side and assigning these two rookies to them			0
both the senior men gave the debutants an ideal platform to show off their skills and how they seized it			0
‘ make no mistake , @entity163 is the next superstar of @entity8 golf , ’ said @entity172 ‘ he is the best partner i have had since @entity26 , and that ’s saying something			1
’ and how about @entity113 , making his debut at the age of 38 and mustering two points from three matches			0
@entity162 and @entity163 were big winners for @entity8 with a 5 & 4 result over @entity15 pair @entity184 and @entity185 @entity163 watches on as @entity162 putts on their way to victory on day two at @entity41 @entity162 rates his team - mate highly : ‘ @entity163 is the next superstar of @entity8 golf			1
he is the best partner i have had since @entity26 , and that ’s saying something ’ alongside @entity193 , @entity75 and @entity184 , the rookies in this @entity31 have been immense			1
the other @entity8 success came from world no 3 @entity70 and world @entity196 , registering their first full point and with some fine golf as well			1
everything was set up for a morning of good scoring , from the fourballs format to benign weather to faster greens , and trust the top players from the two continents to oblige			0
a slew of scoring records fell and immense credit has to go to the @entity15 , who showed lots of heart following their disappointing afternoon on friday , when they collected just half a point			2
it says everything that all four @entity15 pairs were at least eight under , a formidable standard			0
inevitably , @entity85 and @entity63 took the plaudits but there were some gutsy performances from those wearing stars and stripes			0
veteran @entity32 and @entity33 contributed with the former finally beating @entity42 at the @entity31 at the eighth time of asking			1
these two have played in every @entity31 since 1997			0
@entity75 and @entity76 were brilliant again in demolishing @entity83 and @entity72 and then came the late heroics from @entity26 and @entity225 against @entity185 and @entity184			1
@entity225 ’s nerveless play came too late to earn him an afternoon match alongside his old mate rose — the pairings had to be in at 12.30pm			2
mr @entity31 showed up at 12.35pm but it surely left him full of confidence for today			0
not surprisingly , @entity15 captain @entity233 retained faith in three of his four pairings for the fourballs but @entity8 ’s players are so competitively strong it ’s hard to take them out twice in the same day			1
and so the momentum shifted , just as it had on day one			0
the champagne ’s on ice and 50,000 people will descend on @entity41 today thinking only of heroes to acclaim			0
but @entity1 remains a fresh memory , and the @entity31 ’s reputation for drama unrivalled			2
there ’s still work to be done			0
@entity8 's @entity63 ( left ) and @entity59 ( centre ) clinched a 3 & 2 win in the morning over @entity15 pair @entity250 ( right ) and @entity115 @entity225 shows his passion after chipping in at the 15th in the morning when paired with @entity26 but he was rested in the afternoon @entity26 retrieves and throws his ball to his caddie after sinking a putt in their halved match against @entity185 and @entity184 northern irishman @entity26 discusses tactics with @entity225 as they paired up for the morning 's fourballs on day two @entity113 and @entity42 vs @entity114 and @entity115 - @entity8 win 2 & 1 @entity72 and @entity59 vs @entity76 and @entity75 - match halved @entity70 and @entity26 vs @entity32 and @entity33 - @entity8 win 3 & 2 @entity163 and @entity162 vs @entity184 and @entity185 - @entity8 win 5 & 4 @entity59 and @entity63 vs @entity250 and @entity115 - @entity8 win 3 & 2 @entity113 and @entity42 vs @entity32 and @entity33 - @entity15 win 4 & 3 @entity83 and @entity72 vs @entity75 and @entity76 - @entity15 win 5 & 3 @entity26 and @entity225 vs @entity184 and @entity185 - match halved			1

@entity8 take a 10 - 6 lead over the @entity15 into the final day of the @entity31 at @entity41
the hosts take a lead that is the same *margin* held by the @entity15 in 2012 when @entity8 won the ' miracle at @entity1 '
@entity72 and @entity59 halved their match @entity15 young guns @entity76 and @entity75
@entity70 and @entity26 defeated @entity32 and @entity33 3 & 2
@entity8 's @entity163 and @entity162 *dominated* @entity184 and @entity185 5 & 4
@entity225 was given the afternoon off after a *sensational* performance in his halved morning match
