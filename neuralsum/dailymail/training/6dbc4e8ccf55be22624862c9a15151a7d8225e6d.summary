by @entity0 a wealthy businessman is fuming at @entity2 after he claims his brand new £ 75,000 @entity4 was crushed by the supermarket ’s car wash			1
@entity7 was inside his 6 @entity8 when the back window shattered just seconds after paying £ 6.99 for a wash and wax			1
the 48 - year - old quickly realised part of the supermarket ’s car wash in @entity15 , @entity16 , had snagged on the lower edge of his @entity4 ’s boot			1
but instead of the safety mechanism cutting off the machine , the roller continued to rise - pushing the boot up into the back window			1
@entity25 's £ 75,000 @entity4 pictured after it went through the @entity2 car wash in @entity15 mr @entity25 had just parked inside the car wash when he said he suddenly heard a loud ' splintering ' sound he quickly turned on the engine and drove out of the car wash to check the damage to his pride and joy - which he had bought only two months earlier			1
he has since been quoted £ 4,000 to fix the damage but has been forced to put the @entity4 in a garage and cycle 16 miles to work while he waits for the car to get repaired			2
today the dad - of - two blasted the supermarket giant which he claims is refusing to accept liability			2
this however , has been disputed by a @entity2 spokesperson , who said the company had not yet finished its investigation into the incident			2
he said : ' i was typing away an email on my phone and heard a splintering sound and thought " that sounds expensive "			0
' i looked in the mirror and nothing happened and then i heard this crunching noise as the boot was somehow forced open and lifted up			0
' then as the car wash came over it , it thrust it forward through the back window			1
at this point i looked up and there was this almighty noise			0
' i fired up the car and drove outside the car wash			1
once i drove out , the remains of the window fell out			0
the boot was completely knackered too			0
mr @entity25 said the car window smashed only seconds after he had paid the £ 6.99 for a wash and wax the @entity4 - a 6 @entity8 - cost £ 75,000 and was only two months old when the incident occurred ' i called @entity2 customer services immediately telling them what had happened and within a week they had basically denied liability			1
' they did n’t even send somebody to look at my car			0
the car wash was broken by the incident			1
' but they got an engineer in who presumably just pushed the reset button and said the car wash was fine			1
' @entity2 said to me they did n’t deny that the incident took place but because the car wash was fine beforehand and now the engineer said it ’s working , it ’s not their liability			1
' they are completely washing their hands of it			0
' mr @entity25 - who is the managing director of a fitness equipment company - spoke to the car wash manager immediately after the incident at 8.15am on july 30			2
he then phoned @entity2 customer services who told him an engineer who they sent to check the car wash had reported no faults			1
mr @entity25 outside the @entity15 , @entity99 car wash which he claims severely damaged his @entity4 mr @entity25 , who lives with his wife @entity100 , 48 , and two children @entity102 , 15 , and @entity103 , 13 , in @entity104 , @entity105 , added : ' it makes you think what would have happened if my kids were in the back of the car			1
' a lot of kids put their faces against the back window to watch the roomers			2
all sorts of horrible things could have happened			0
' they should have reported it to the health and safety executive and done a proper investigation			0
' i want to take it to the small claims court but it is me against @entity2 ’ legal team			2
' when wanton destruction is wreaked upon your car , they should surely just pay up			0
' i am waiting for the repair to be approved			0
the boot ca n’t shut and the back window is n’t present so i ca n’t drive at all			1
' i have been quoted £ 4,000 but that could go up if they find the force has caused something else to be damaged once they remove the boot			2
' i am cycling 25km to go to work every day			0
i had only had the car two months , it has only got 2,000 miles on the clock			0
' this was my latest and greatest purchase			0
it was my pride and joy , the whole experience has been utterly horrific			0
' a @entity2 spokesperson declined to comment other than to say its investigation had not been completed .			2
