by @entity0 a television programme is out to test whether innocent people can be brainwashed in becoming unwitting assassins as in the plot of political thriller @entity5			0
in the 1959 novel , a man is brainwashed into becoming an unwitting sleeper assassin as part of a @entity11 conspiracy to overthrow the @entity13 government			1
the novel and its film adaptations have intrigued many , and related conspiracy theories have long - held that the @entity13 government and others have tried to develop techniques to control the minds of individuals			2
programmed to kill : @entity25 and @entity26 in a scene from the 1962 cinema adaptation of @entity5 , in which a man is brainwashed into becoming an assassin as part of a communist plot in one famous case , the assassin who killed presidential candidate @entity33 , christian palestinian @entity32 , later claimed he was hypnotised into carrying out the killing			1
likewise , @entity37 , the newspaper heiress kidnapped by the left - wing revolutionary group the @entity39 , claim the gang brainwashed her into taking part in a bank robbery			2
there have been government - sponsored studies into the possibility of mind control			1
between the @entity49 and @entity50 , the @entity48 conducted controversial experiments to develop behavioural engineering that many believed aimed at brainwashing subjects			1
@entity55 was the code name for a covert @entity48 human research program run by the @entity48 @entity58			1
the program began in the early fifties and continued at least through the @entity61 , using mainly @entity13 and @entity63 citizens as its test subjects			0
the published evidence indicates that @entity55 involved the use of many methodologies to manipulate individual mental states and alter brain function , including the surreptitious administration of drugs and other chemicals , sensory deprivation , isolation , and verbal and sexual abuse			1
it was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by @entity78 , through investigations by the @entity80 , and by a presidential commission known as the @entity82			0
however , investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that cia director @entity85 ordered all @entity55 files destroyed in 1973			2
the @entity80 and @entity82 investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived @entity85 ' destruction order			0
in recent times most information regarding @entity55 has been officially declassified			2
it was first made available through a @entity95 request in 1977 that uncovered a cache of some 20,000 documents relating to project @entity55 and led to @entity99 hearings			1
in july of 2001 some surviving information regarding @entity55 was officially declassified			2
investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that @entity85 , director of the @entity48 , ordered many files related to the programme - known as @entity55 - destroyed in 1973 , years before any investigation into it began			1
it was nevertheless found that the remit of the project was to develop mind - controlling drugs and techniques , with the @entity48 especially interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders			1
now a @entity116 documentary aims to see if it is indeed possible to persuade unwitting , law - abiding subjects to become cold - blooded killers who will shoot someone to order , today 's @entity113 blog reports			0
experimental psychopathologist @entity120 , who oversaw the study , says in a trailer for the documentary : ' science has only begun to understand how the brain works , and one of the things we do n't yet understand is whether it 's possible to control someone else 's mind			1
' the programme will show work with a group of test subjects who gave their consent to take part in a hypnosis study for television			0
they were not told that the ultimate objective of the study , as described in its trailer , is ' to take a mentally healthy , law - abiding individual and program them to shoot and kill a complete stranger '			0
not all experts are agreed on whether the goal is possible to achieve			0
@entity150 neuroscientist @entity149 , who also contributes to the film , said : ' what we 're trying to do here is strip away someone 's sense of free will and see if they can carry out extreme acts			2
' can it be done ? well , i 'm not so sure that it can			0
' curiosity : @entity164 will be broadcast on sunday night at 9pm on the @entity116			0
