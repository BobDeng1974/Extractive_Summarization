by @entity0 published : 14:36 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 30 july 2013 imagine if the internet was mapped out like a solar system with the world 's biggest websites represented by individual planets			1
but instead of the map of just a handful of planets that we 're used to seeing when learning about space , @entity6 , a website set up by a @entity9 data - visualisation designer , has in excess of 350,000 different planets which reveal which sites we click on the most			1
@entity23 's fascinating website , colour codes websites from more than 196 countries with the hundreds of thousands of different sized dots intricately mapped out to precision			2
wide world : the @entity26 is the brainchild of @entity27			0
@entity29 's position in the web solar system is circled going global : a map of the internet shows the world 's most read websites			0
the bigger the circle of a website is , the more traffic it gets traffic : users can click on each website represented to find out more about its traffic full spectrum : all manor of websites , from news sites , entertainment and shopping sites are mapped out on the website the map features all manner of websites , from news sites like the @entity29 , entertainment sites and a vast array of shopping websites			1
but while sites , or planets , are not grouped according to their subject matter , they are not merely mapped out in a random mess			0
web users browsing different sites form links and the stronger the links - or the more times browsers jump between two sites - determines the planets ' proximity to one another			0
each circle estimates the percentage of global internet traffic which goes to each site - unsurprisingly the largest website are @entity76 with roughly 39 per cent of the total internet traffic and @entity78 with almost 44 per cent			2
red sea : some of the biggest websites in the world in terms of traffic are @entity9 websites mapped out : @entity86 websites generate the third most traffic in the world and some @entity86 sites are among the biggest on the ' solar system ' @entity90 boasts the most websites on the map , with a staggering 96,978 from the @entity90 all represented by a teal coloured circle			1
@entity95 has the second most sites with more than 36,000 websites included on the map while @entity86 is the third most represented country on the chart with a little over 31,000			2
surprisingly , @entity100 is the fourth most represented country on the map , with 18,183 pinpointed			0
the @entity102 has almost 9.500 ' planets ' on the solar system of most visited websites			0
meticulous : it may look like a range of different coloured paint splashes , but sites are mapped according to their relationship with one another			1

data - visualisation designer @entity27 *created* the internet map
sites sized and coloured according to traffic and their country of *origin*
sites are mapped according to their relationship with one another
