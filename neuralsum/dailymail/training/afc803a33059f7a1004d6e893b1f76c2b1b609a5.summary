for the past 35 years i have collected amazing specimens specifically for this project			1
i then carefully break those specimens down into smaller pieces , embed them in resin , and you end up with an epic museum in a manageable space			2
if you consider the age of some of these specimens - it ’s been billions of years in the making			1
’ the majority of these specimens were acquired directly from contacting specialists recommended to mr @entity17 by museum curators , research scientists and university historians			1

i had never seen this done before and it was beautiful			0
‘ then , all at once , i saw it - my first product idea : the @entity58 , a grand collection within a manageable space			1
i was seven years old			2
‘ several times throughout the next year i would discuss the project with my father and with his friends			0
these were researchers who had won @entity138 and been knighted for their scientific accomplishments			0
they helped me refine the list to about 20 things we all agreed we ’d like to have on our desks or in our pockets and they recommended ways of acquiring each of them - we even got on the phone and started calling museum curators for recommended sources			0
’ @entity17 had asked for $ 38,000 on crowdsourced - funding website @entity101 , but has already seen 2,401 backers pledge $ 584,169 prior to the end date of 20 march			1

i ’ve never been more passionate about a project in my entire life			0
