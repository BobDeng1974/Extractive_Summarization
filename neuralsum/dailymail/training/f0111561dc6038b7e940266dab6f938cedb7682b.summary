by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 man injured in the @entity5 bombings has filed a defamation lawsuit against @entity7 after the conservative radio host accused him of being ' the money man ' behind the fatal attack			1
the former @entity12 host concocted a conspiracy theory following the april 2013 attack that connected @entity15 to @entity16 and from there linked the idea to the @entity20 administration			0
adding to the absurdity of @entity7 's claims that @entity23 , 20 , was a conspirator in the @entity25 bombings is the fact that @entity23 was a spectator at the race who was one of hundreds of people injured in the terrorist attack			1
' the radio host spent the next several days lobbing unfounded accusations against the young @entity3 man , challenging anyone who did n't believe him to prove him wrong			1
@entity7 even suggested that president @entity20 was somehow involved in the attack after photos emerged of what appeared to be @entity20 visiting @entity56 in the hospital following the attack - as she did with dozens of the bombing victims			1
@entity7 's campaign to pin the attack on @entity23 was stalled when a former immigration official explained to him how a person would get the designation of 212 @entity46 , and how his theory about @entity23 ' does n't make sense			2
' after the appearance by former @entity70 special agent @entity69 seemed to discredit the majority of @entity7 's theory , the radio host went from talking about it every day to rarely mentioning it , apparently hoping his listeners would forget that it ever happened			2
one person who definitely did n't forget is @entity23 , who has named @entity7 and his companies , @entity78 and @entity78 - as well as his radio syndicator , @entity80 - in the defamation lawsuit it filed in federal court			2
tragic : three people were killed during the bombing , as well as a police officer fatally shot by one of the suspected bombers according to the suit , first obtained by @entity90 , @entity7 ' repeatedly and falsely ' identified @entity23 as having been an active participant in the attack			2
on april 21 , less than a week after the attack , @entity7 went on his radio program and said , ' let me just say this to those at the highest echelons of government , we know who this @entity3 national is , and it is in your best interest and the best interest of integrity and trust for the people of @entity110 – it ’s best coming from you , not coming from a news organization			1
it ’s best coming from you			0
you have until ( april 22 )			0
we have information on who this man is , ( and ) we know he is a very bad , bad , bad man			0
' @entity7 later identified this ' very bad , bad , bad man ' as @entity23			2
after the april 15 bombing , authorities questioned @entity23 , who allowed officer to search his apartment			0
authorities quickly determined that @entity23 had nothing to do with the bombing - other than having been injured in the attack			1
@entity23 was one of about 265 people injured during the april 15 , 2013 , blast th but @entity7 's onslaught claiming he was a terrorist waged on - which led to harassment from those who those who believed @entity23 was responsible for the bombing			1
' according to the suit , since @entity7 made his claims that @entity23 was behind the terrorist attack , people have left the young @entity3 messages calling him a ' murderer , child killer , and terrorist			1
' the harassment , @entity23 's attorneys say , was the direct result of @entity7 's unfounded claims that he was involved in the bombings			0
' those statements were made widely and publicly , ' the suit claims			0
' the statements were false and did grave injury to the plaintiff			0
' @entity23 is seeking punitive damages for defamation with malice .			0

for several days after the @entity25 bombing , conservative radio host @entity7 claimed he had proof that a 20 - year - old @entity3 national was the ' money man ' for the attack
@entity23 , the man @entity7 claimed was responsible for the bombing , was actually injured in the attack
authorities investigated @entity23 and quickly determined he had nothing to do with the bombing
even after he was cleared , @entity7 *continued* to claim @entity23 was involved in the attack
