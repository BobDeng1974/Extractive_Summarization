by @entity0 @entity2 ’s most respected tax experts yesterday undermined @entity4 ’s case for raising the top rate of tax to 50p			1
members of @entity8 said the @entity10 ’s proposal to re-introduce the measure would raise ‘ little revenue ’			1
the think - tank said it would make only a ‘ marginal contribution ’ to cutting the budget deficit			0
no use : clothing tycoon @entity17 ( right ) has accused @entity4 of ' extreme @entity19 nonsense ' as the business backlash against @entity21 gathered pace , an opinion poll last night put @entity21 ’s lead over the @entity25 at just one point			1
the @entity28 survey for the @entity29 put @entity21 on 33 per cent , with the @entity25 on 32 , @entity30 on 14 and the @entity31 trailing on 9			0
and at least eight more business leaders have signed a letter opposing @entity21 ’s tax plans and warning that it would deter business and destroy jobs			1
one of the 31 who have now signified their concerns is a donor who has loaned @entity21 £ 2 million and says no businessman in @entity2 would do so again while the party targets entrepreneurs			0
clothing tycoon @entity17 , who also owns restaurants including @entity45 , accused mr @entity4 of peddling ‘ extreme socialist nonsense ’ and said it would be ‘ impossible ’ for @entity21 to get funds from wealthy individuals in future			1
mr @entity4 announced on saturday that @entity21 would raise the income tax rate from 45p to 50p in the pound for those earning more than £ 150,000			1
@entity54 weighed in on the conflict by calling on the chancellor to cut the top tax rate to 40p he claimed it was justified to help eliminate the deficit , arguing that the top earners paid almost £ 10 billion more in tax in the three years when the 50p rate was in place than when the government conducted its assessment of the tax back in 2012			1
but the @entity67 said mr @entity4 was basing the figures on @entity70 projections rather than real returns and said there was ‘ little evidence ’ to suggest that a 50p rate would raise more			2
the think - tank instead backed chancellor @entity77 ’s estimates that the top rate would bring in just £ 100 million extra – which the @entity67 called a ‘ very small amount of money ’			1
the think - tank concluded : ‘ the best evidence we have still suggests that raising the top rate of tax would raise little revenue and make , at best , a marginal contribution to reducing the budget deficit an incoming government would face after the next election			1
’ the number of bosses opposing mr @entity4 ’s plans yesterday hit 31			2
they include @entity96 , chairman of @entity98 ’s @entity97			0
she said : ‘ this is not a pro-aspiration policy			0
we want people to aspire , to want to succeed , to create jobs and , yes , to be rewarded for their hard work and risk			0
’ mr @entity17 , who said he expects @entity21 to pay back the outstanding £ 200,000 of a £ 2 million loan he gave the party in 2006 , said the present regime ‘ seem to be prepared to say anything to get a vote ’			2
‘ when you look at the arithmetic it ’s a nonsense , ’ he added			2
mr @entity17 compared mr @entity4 ’s plans to those of @entity116 president @entity115 , who has had to backtrack after introducing a 75 per cent tax rate			1
‘ it ’s the same deal			0
extreme , extreme , socialist nonsense , ’ he said			1
he said it would now be ‘ impossible ’ for @entity21 to get loans from donors			0
he said of the tax plans : ‘ i do n’t think you ’ll find any businessman in this country who will say it ’s a smart idea , because it is n’t			2
’ even the @entity129 , where mr @entity4 once worked , denounces his plans this morning as ‘ yet one more measure to punish enterprise ’			2
@entity133 insisted his own decision to cut the rate to 45p had been the best for the country			2
‘ @entity21 are now doing something that ’s politically convenient but is very , very bad for our economy ’ , he told the @entity138			0
@entity98 mayor @entity54 even called for the @entity25 to return to a tax rate to 40p , the level at which it remained for almost all of the last @entity21 government			1
but @entity147 yesterday defended the plans as ‘ utterly fair and utterly reasonable ’ because of a squeeze on living standards			0
the @entity21 leader has previously stated publicly that a 50p rate should be permanent			0
however , shadow business secretary @entity153 last night said it would only be a temporary measure			0
he added : ‘ this is n’t some ideological expedition			0
