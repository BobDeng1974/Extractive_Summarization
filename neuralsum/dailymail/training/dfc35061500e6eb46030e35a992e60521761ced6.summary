by @entity0 last updated at 8:21 am on 2nd february 2012 a mysterious blood - thirsty wild cat feared to have devoured at least six animals in the @entity4 countryside was today revealed to be a mere fox			1
dna tests on two mutilated deer confirmed the killer 's true identity			1
last month , three wallabies were found on farmland stripped to the bone , with their internal organs neatly placed beside their bodies			0
mutilated : one of three wallabies found devoured on farmland in the @entity16 last month			2
what was thought to be a blood - thirsty wild cat roaming the @entity4 countryside was today revealed to be a mere fox that find came soon after the discovery of the bodies of three deer in countryside near @entity26			1
examinations revealed all the animals had suffered puncture wounds to the neck , consistent with a vicious attack by a panther - like creature			0
it was then claimed that the animals were killed by the ' wildcat of @entity36 ' , named after the national park where its first prey was found			0
but eagerly awaited dna results , taken from the body of two of the deer , showed no big cat saliva and pointed to a wily fox as the real culprit			1
dr @entity46 , associate professor at the @entity47 at the @entity48 , which analysed the results , said : ' we did not detect cat dna on either deer carcass			1
' other than deer , by far the strongest genetic signal we found on the @entity56 carcass was from a fox			1
' that fox dna was found on the ribs , legs and plucking sites from the @entity36 deer carcass			1
' on the second deer carcass we found canid dna			1
a more detailed analysis is underway to pin down the canid species but our expectation is that that will also be fox dna			2
' red herring : this image of a large black animal in a field in north - west @entity74 was thought to be the ' beast ' stalking the @entity16 real culprit : dna tests on two mutilated deer confirmed the killer to be a fox ( file picture ) big cat experts led the call for an investigation into suspicious activity after a roe deer was found dead in @entity56 on january 4			1
it had been torn open and was missing its heart , kidneys and liver			0
its snout was also missing , a significant piece of information because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth , causing death by suffocation			0
experts had believed the deer had been brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma , jaguar or leopard			2
@entity106 of the animal 's fur were also found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh			0
another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between @entity118 and @entity119 , near @entity120 - ten miles away - on january 10			2
a third roe deer body was found at a development in @entity124 's edge , near @entity125 , days later			2
three wallabies , part of a private collection , were also found dead by their devastated owner on january 6 , two days after his first kill at @entity56			0
examination : a man completes a dna test on the carcass of one of the deer killed last month tests : this roe deer was killed less than 12 miles from where three wallabies were devoured the @entity4 farmer , located 12 miles from the first attack , did not want to divulge his name or location			1
but he did release gory pictures of one of the dead wallabies			0
the carcasses had been ripped open in a similar way to the three roe deers the beast is believed to have slayed			0
dr @entity46 took 45 samples from the wounds of two of the deer carcasses with the aim of testing specifically for @entity133 from the saliva			0
his team searched for more than 30 different types of big cat dna in their sample			2
but their results will disappoint experts - who still insist that the beasts are stalking the @entity166 countryside			1
@entity167 , a @entity4 big cat expert who believed the ' @entity170 ' was on the prowl , said : ' there has been speculation of breeding amongst feral big cats in the @entity166			1
' we are no closer to indicating that with these results , but lessons have been learnt from @entity48 's valuable input to this exercise			0
' we should not be complacent about possible big cats in the @entity166 , but considering these animals living secretly in our landscape can fire people 's imaginations and help us consider all of the wild nature around us			0
' our outdoors can still hold surprises			0

experts feared a wild cat was stalking the @entity4 countryside
dna tests on two mutilated deer reveal killer is just a wily fox
