by @entity0 i have seen @entity2 reduce grown men to giggling sycophancy			1
it is not intimidation that does it – at least not in my experience – but charm			2
he is only 5ft 3in in his socks but he has a charisma that fills a room			1
hearing the evidence he gave this week in @entity16 at the start of a five - month bribery trial that may strip him of his sport , as well as his liberty , i was reminded of this knack			2
asked whether he was divorced or married , he replied : ‘ both			2
’ i can envisage his usual squinting look of befuddlement and hear his dead - pan , sotto voce delivery			1
‘ i like to remember the divorce bit , ’ he added with emphasis			2
humour , usually in the form of a one - liner , has been one of his great weapons through the 60 years and more in which he transformed himself into a billionaire			1
an eye for a deal is another obvious part of the arsenal			1
d - day : @entity2 arrives at court as he faces trial in @entity42 no laughing matter : @entity2 is flanked by his lawyers as he arrives at court in @entity16 his line in @entity16 took me back to the @entity48 in @entity49 at the end of last year			1
there , he was asked about the hypothetical idea of paying millions to buy off a blackmailer who alleged erroneously that he had cheated on his ex-wife , @entity56			2
pressed on whether he would really do that , he said : ‘ you have n’t met my wife			0
’ while we ’re on the subject of @entity2 ’s wit , here is what he told me in 2012 about his daughter @entity66 ’s £ 5million wedding : ' i had to do something at the time that upset me			1
i had to give her away			0
i ’d rather have sold her			0
’ in the same interview , i asked him when he thought he would hand over @entity73			0
‘ past 100 , i ’m definitely out , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t know who should do it – honestly there ’s nobody i despise enough that i would wish this on them			0
’ asked on another occasion when his autobiography would be published , he responded : ‘ the morning after i die			0
and the first 12 copies will go to the @entity83			0
’ last month when asked what he thought of the quieter new engine noise , he said he would like the sound to be louder , before adding @entity87 - style : ‘ i wish i could get it up			2
’ not everyone will find all the jokes to his or her taste			0
they are often distinctly un-pc			0
certainly , the next two examples will offend many sensibilities but i include them to give a true flavour of the man			0
asked about the merits of having a female driver in @entity73 , he opined : ‘ what i would really like is to find the right girl , perhaps a black girl with super looks , preferably @entity104 or @entity105 , who speaks @entity106			0
’ and questioned about @entity107 , who made her name racing in @entity109 , he said : ‘ you know , i ’ve got one of these wonderful ideas that women should all be dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances			0
’ humour : @entity2 is well known for his wit and one - liners in fairness , he could laugh at himself as easily as others			1
after being mugged , he posed , his face black and blue , for a watch advert under the banner : ‘ see what people will do for a @entity126			0
’ ( i ’m not counting his remark that he admired @entity128 for being ‘ able to get things done ’ as a quip ; he actually meant that one			0
) @entity2 has said and done many stupid things , he has looked old - fashioned and , to some minds , bigoted , yet his sense of mischief has unmistakably drawn in many people			1
in the early days his charm opened doors for him , a second - hand car dealer , to play chemmy with the likes of @entity141 , @entity142 and , at least once , @entity143			2
it enabled him to do deals nobody else had the chutzpah to attempt			0
and it means he still has a direct line in to presidents , prime ministers , small - town dictators , titans of industry , the good , the bad and the dangerous			1
@entity156 power : @entity2 remains in charge of @entity73 despite his advancing years but , as he learned when mr @entity159 published his scathing judgment in the previous @entity48 hearing , the quips do not make a jot of difference in the legal matters at hand , namely whether he bribed a @entity42 banker to sell the sport at a reduced price so he could continue running it			1
that is why it is best for him that he will not be giving evidence directly in @entity16 , but only through his lawyers			0
for once , it ’s not jokes that can save @entity2			1
there has been discussion , including on the @entity179 ’s back page , about when precisely @entity2 ’s absolute control over @entity73 was irretrievably broken			1
having to stand down from the @entity73 board to fight charges in @entity42 was a big moment			0
so , too , was the verdict of mr @entity159 , who , to elaborate on the item above , found in @entity2 ’s favour on a technicality but condemned his evidence as unreliable			1
might i suggest another significant moment , which has yet to materialise ? it is when he no longer decides who gets a paddock pass , the entree to the sport ’s inner sanctum			2
it is said that even @entity199 , chairman of @entity200 , the sport ’s owners , is beholden to @entity2 ’s patronage on this one			1
he who hands out the passes , holds the power			1
a thought to ponder as we approach next week ’s 20th anniversary commemoration of @entity211 ’s death			1
many rank the brilliant @entity213 as the finest of all drivers ; he is certainly a contender for the accolade			0
but i wonder whether , in general , those who survived their careers should not be granted greater recognition than those who perished			0
remembered : @entity211 was killed 20 years ago next week memories : pictures of @entity211 are seen on a fence at the site where he died at the race track in @entity225 after all , in eras past , survival was the ultimate achievement			2
as well as luck , it took skill to live – to assemble a dependable team around you , to feel impending malfunction before it killed you , to ensure you ran off the track as infrequently as possible			0
one piece of vaguely @entity211 - related trivia			1
@entity238 went behind his dad ’s car to cry when he heard his idol was dead , so one might think his helmet has been yellow for most of his career in homage to @entity211			1
he was told to wear yellow so his fretful father could spot him among fellow young karters			2
nonetheless , what chance @entity238 returning to a full yellow helmet as a mark of respect to @entity211 at the next race , in @entity106 ? it would be a heartfelt touch			1

@entity2 is only 5ft 3in in his socks has a charisma that fills a room
an eye for a deal is another obvious part of his armoury
@entity2 laughs at himself as much as he laughs at others
he has a direct line to presidents , prime ministers and small - town dictators
@entity2 hands out the paddock passes , and so holds the power
@entity211 a great but should living be recognised as well as the dead ?
@entity238 wears yellow helmet because he dad told him to
