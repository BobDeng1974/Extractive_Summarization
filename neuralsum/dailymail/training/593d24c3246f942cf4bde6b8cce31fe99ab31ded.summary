by @entity0 @entity1 has been manager of @entity2 since may 2012			1
he is a figure who divides opinions ; for some he is a quiet voice of sanity amid the prevailing madness , for others he is a bland , uninspiring presence			2
all agree , however , that @entity1 is an instinctively courteous man who controls temper and tongue whatever the provocation			1
now , it seems , we shall all have to think again			2
the eruption occurred during his spirited defence of @entity2 ’s midweek performance against @entity21			1
@entity22 : @entity1 hit out at the press following the 1 - 0 win over @entity21 at @entity25 on wednesday boss : @entity1 saw the positives in the performance , complaining that the media are always turning the knife his critics having scented blood during the @entity34 campaign , @entity1 believes that they are seizing every chance to turn the knife			1
the sparking point was a questioner ’s tendentious use of a statistic			2
‘ i ca n’t turn the clock back , ’ he said			1
‘ but what i can do is analyse what i have seen and judge that through my eyes and not because someone is telling me : “ well , you only had two shots at goal			2
” because , for me , that is absolute f * * * * * * b * * * * * * *			2
’ from many managers , such an outburst would be unremarkable ( not for nothing was @entity58 known as ‘ @entity59 ’ during his brief , inglorious spell at @entity61 )			0
but from @entity1 , at an on - the - record press conference , it was startling			1
and it may come to be seen as the turning point in his @entity2 career			1
for the past two years , @entity1 has been at pains to please all and sundry			1
he has appeared determined to give no offence , to offer no harsh or contentious opinions			0
his approach has been scrupulously even - handed : ‘ on the one hand ; but , then again , on the other			2
’ as a result of that — and of his admirable reluctance to indulge in touchline histrionics — he has been accused of lacking ‘ passion ’ , that preposterously over-rated quality which @entity81 football holds so dear			2
now some of his colleagues would have amended that impression by courting the media			0
it is a well - trodden path ; the gushing phone call , the chummy text , the flattering implication that the scribbler ’s opinion is warmly valued			2
why , there are managers who have built their careers upon such methods , but @entity1 is not of that number			1
so far as i am aware , he has bestowed no favours , played no favourites , incurred no obligations			0
which leaves him in a remarkably strong position			0
reaction : @entity25 was half - empty on wednesday night after a disappointing @entity34 campaign had enough ? midfielder @entity104 ( right ) also hit out at criticism of his personal performances his @entity2 contract runs through to the @entity109 finals of 2016			1
the qualifying hurdles are @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 ; barring calamity , all should be cleared with something to spare			2
back then : the press wanted @entity120 out after a 1 - 1 draw with @entity122 in 1988 the pool of @entity81 talent is shallow , since our game prizes domestic greed above international need , but as @entity1 argued the other evening , we have an elite corps of players which is clearly capable of something significant			1
the manager cited the likes of @entity134 , @entity104 and @entity135			2
he added the substitutes @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , and mentioned absentees @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
he paid particular tribute to the dazzling young @entity145 , aware that his main problem there will involve management of expectations			0
had he been able to identify some adequate central defenders , his case might have been even stronger			0
but no matter : the point was well taken			0
so the scene is invitingly set , and i suspect that @entity1 is in the mood to answer the invitation			1
already , he has brought qualities of dignity and intelligence to the task , and all the signs suggest that his players appreciate his methods			2
likewise the public , whose loyalty has been unstinting			0
a half – empty @entity25 provoked many a glib sneer last week , and yet , as an expression of public optimism , a gate of 40,000 was quite staggering			0
the next move lies with the manager , and there is at least one encouraging precedent for his situation			2
change in mood : @entity120 on the bench with @entity2 boss in 1988 , before his fortune changed heroes : @entity120 then took @entity2 to the @entity34 in @entity182 in 1990 , putting in a passionate performance twenty - six years ago , @entity120 ’s @entity2 team reached the @entity186 finals , where they were beaten in the group stage by the @entity188 , @entity189 and the @entity190			1
the ensuing abuse was savagely hysterical			0
the side came home and played out a sterile draw in a friendly with @entity122 , whereupon one crass headline bellowed : ‘ in the name of @entity198 , go ! ’ two years later , @entity120 led his team to @entity200			1
improving game by game , they reached the semi-finals , where they lost a cruelly close battle on penalties to @entity208			0
@entity120 was established as by far the best and most successful @entity2 manager since sir @entity210 , but he never forgot the pain he had suffered , and how he had coped			1
another era : @entity213 , one of @entity2 's finest performers at @entity200 , playing in the semi-final years later — knighted , feted and installed as a national treasure — he told me how he had decided to be his own man , to stand or fall by his own decisions			1
then he said something profound : ‘ i remember thinking : “ if i ’m going to have regrets , then they ’ve got to be for the things i did , not for the things i did n’t do			0
” does that make sense ? ’ he was a wise man , was @entity120 , and it was wisdom born of painful experience			1
@entity1 has suffered a little of the pain while accumulating a similar store of experience			1
he has been offered the chance to become one of @entity2 ’s most memorable managers			1
now he must seize it			0
slotted : @entity237 puts away the penalty - the only goal of the game - in the sterile win against @entity21 do n’t worry @entity237 , it ’s just a strip of cloth the choice of @entity237 as @entity2 captain was not universally popular			1
some worried that the responsibility might prove inhibiting and that his form might suffer			0
in the event , the armband made not a scrap of difference			1
@entity237 worked as hard as ever in the match against @entity21 but his touch was wayward , his efforts unproductive and a game which once came so easily to him now seemed a murky mystery			1
just a title : @entity237 captained @entity2 on wednesday night , but the armband made no difference when he departed , in the 69th minute , he appeared uncertain what to do with the band			1
he looked around , spotted @entity265 nearby and hastily passed it on			0
it would be good to report that @entity265 was inspired by his call to the colours			0
in truth , he simply carried on making the same mistakes he had been making all evening , before thrusting it at @entity275 with six minutes remaining			0
the transactions evoked images of harassed mothers handing over a screeching infant			0
there are those who cling to the caricature of captaincy , the peculiarly @entity81 myth of the fist - shaking skipper , rallying his troops by the force of his personality			2
that delusion perished when @entity290 hung up his boots at @entity292			0
put it in : rooney in training ahead of @entity2 's @entity296 qualifier against @entity111 we now accept that the captain is required to predict the toss of a coin and make a choice of ends			1
but we resist pretentious attempts to mystify the office			0
for we know that the reality of football captaincy can be quite different			0
and that it can involve three embarrassed young men , hurriedly exchanging a shabby bauble			0
because convention insists that somebody has to be nominally ‘ in charge ’ ; his authority signified by a strip of cloth			0
gatlin the problem for @entity318 @entity319 , @entity322 ’s @entity321 long jump champion , fears for the future of track and field			1
with competitions dwindling and public interest fading , he calls for urgent action			0
‘ there has to be a way of showcasing athletics to make it more fun , ’ says @entity319			1
he believes there should be more street events , such as @entity336 ’s excellent @entity335 , and he makes a strong case			2
accessible : @entity319 believes their should be more street events like the @entity335 but on the very day that he expressed his worries , a cheat named @entity342 ran the 100 metres in 9.77 secs , the fastest time of the year			1
@entity342 is free to compete , despite having served two bans for the use of illegal drugs and his presence is an unacceptable disgrace			0
for until the public can believe what it is watching , honourable men like @entity319 will be cruelly handicapped in their struggle to save a great sport			1
triumph : @entity342 recorded a years best time of 9.77s in @entity356 on friday evening @entity357 when @entity362 was asked why his @entity364 team - mate , @entity363 , was so desperate to beat him , he answered : ‘ it ’s because i ’m good - looking , man			1
i ’ve got the car , i ’ve got the girlfriend			0
what can i say ? ’ there are times when i wonder why i find it impossible to take @entity370 as seriously as it takes itself			0
i suspect that the self – effacing @entity372 has just supplied the answer			0
in the middle : @entity375 sat between @entity363 and @entity362 at thursday 's press conference			2

@entity1 's fuse was lit after the 1 - 0 win over @entity21 on wednesday
@entity1 defended his players and believes they are going forward
the @entity2 manager should cast his mind back to @entity120 's time
@entity120 was criticised during the qualifying period for @entity186
the *legendary* manager showed passion , and took @entity2 to their most successful @entity34 performance since 1966 , at @entity200
the captain 's armband made no difference to @entity237 's performance
*olympic* champion @entity319 fears for the future of track and field
