by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 became only the second team to score 100 @entity5 goals on wednesday night as @entity7 's side reached the landmark with a 4 - 0 win against @entity10			1
many had predicted that @entity2 's firepower would ensure a stroll towards this year 's @entity5 title and although it has n't been quite that simple , the century of goals is a huge reason why the @entity19 team have one hand of the trophy with one game to play			1
here , @entity23 takes a look at just how @entity2 have reached 100 goals and why they look on course to break @entity28 's record of 103 ( they only need to score four against @entity29 , after all )			2
whatever you want to call him , it 's no understatement to say @entity2 would be nowhere near the @entity5 summit without @entity33 's goals and his ability to drive his team forward when they need him most			1
the 30 - year - old is @entity2 's top scorer this season and has added free - kicks to his far - ranging list of skills , scoring five set pieces this term			2
driving force : the @entity58 has scored some vital goals for @entity2 including this one against @entity60 @entity61 - 17 goals city would surely be closer to the 120 goal mark for the season if the diminutive @entity66 forward had steered clear of injuries			1
undoubtedly one of the best strikers in the world , @entity61 has missed huge chunks of football but has still bagged 17 goals for his side and has been a huge factor to their success			0
forward thinking : @entity61 has bagged 17 goals to add to @entity2 's century of goals in and out : @entity2 and @entity61 would no - doubt have more goals if it was n't for @entity61 's injury record @entity83 - 16 goals somehow , @entity83 is n't a fan favourite at the @entity86 despite popping up with hugely important goals throughout the season			1
the @entity90 striker is seen as a third choice behind @entity61 and @entity92 , but he has scored four crucial goals in the past week alone to help @entity2 defeat both @entity95 and @entity10 while leading the line admirably in @entity61 's absence			2
@entity92 - 9 goals ' @entity99 ' looked as though he was going to be one of the signings of the season after hitting the ground running and finding the net on several occasions at the start of the campaign			0
the @entity110 striker 's goals may have dried up of late but nine is his first season in @entity113 football is n't a bad return and one he 'll be looking to build on next season			0
double : @entity83 has scored some pivotal goals for @entity2 including two against @entity10 on wednesday helping hand : @entity92 ( left ) has picked up nine goals while @entity121 has added seven @entity121 - 7 goals the @entity110 maestro usually finds himself at the centre of everything good for @entity2 and @entity121 has certainly been one of @entity2 's standout players			1
the 28 - year - old can take huge credit from the fact that @entity2 have scored 100 goals scoring seven and setting up nine for his team - mates			0
@entity134 - 6 goals @entity134 has been in inspired form during some important periods for his club and has popped up with vital goals against the likes of @entity60 and @entity141			0
the @entity142 , like @entity121 , has also been crucial in setting up goals for his team - mates and has picked up seven assists for the season every little helps : @entity134 has chipped in with six goals , but also has seven assists to his name @entity151 - 5 goals it 's not really his job , but the @entity155 summer signing has chipped in with five goals from his deep - lying midfield role			0
@entity151 has been the perfect foil for @entity159 in the centre of the pitch this season with the pair forming what must be one of the most powerful midfield duos in the @entity5			0
@entity167 - 4 goals the flying winger has been in and out of the @entity2 first team for his fledgling year in @entity113 , but a return of four goals and seven assists has been a good start to his @entity86 career			0
strike : @entity151 celebrates scoring during @entity2 's 6 - 3 win against @entity178 earlier in the season debut : @entity167 has picked up four goals during his first season in @entity113 football @entity183 - 3 goals after missing the majority of the season with injury , @entity183 has slowly started to look the part in a @entity190 shirt			2
the striker will be hoping to score far more than three goals next season , however , as @entity2 's strikeforce grows ever stronger			0
@entity195 - 3 goals the @entity2 captain has had another brilliant season at the heart of defence and has been one of @entity7 's key men			0
if your team is going to reach 100 @entity5 goals , strikes from defenders are vital and he has scored three times to help reach the target			1
three and easy : @entity183 celebrates scoring his third goal of the season during @entity2 's win against @entity10 nearly there : @entity214 's 99th @entity5 goal of the season from the back : @entity195 ( left ) and @entity217 have also helped @entity2 towards 100 @entity217 - 2 goals the @entity66 had a rocky start to his career , but @entity217 has stepped up to the plate to become @entity224 's most trusted lieutenant and he 's grabbed two goals for his side			1
@entity227 , @entity228 , @entity230 - 1 goal each own goals - 5 solo : @entity227 celebrates scoring his only goal of the season during @entity2 's win against @entity236 one each : @entity228 ( left ) and @entity230 have a goal each for the season			1

@entity2 become second team to reach 100 @entity5 goals in a single season
@entity28 scored 103 @entity5 goals during the *2009/10* season
@entity33 scored the landmark goal during @entity2 's 4 - 0 win against @entity10
@entity33 , @entity61 and @entity83 have hit double figures this season
