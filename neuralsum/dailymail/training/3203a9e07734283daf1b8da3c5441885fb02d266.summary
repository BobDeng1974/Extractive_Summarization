thousands of lives a year could be saved by using a dialysis - like device to clean up poisoned blood , research suggests			2
each year , some 37,000 @entity4 die of sepsis , after their immune system dramatically overreacts to an infection , causing their organs to fail			1
this makes sepsis a bigger killer than breast and bowel cancer combined			1
each year , some 37,000 @entity4 die of sepsis , after their immune system dramatically overreacts to an infection , causing their organs to fail ( file photo ) those at risk include patients who have had their appendix removed , as well as people with drips , catheters and even simple urinary tract infections			1
identifying the bug at the root of the problem can take days – and even then the antibiotics used do n’t always work			1
researcher dr @entity27 , who was part - funded by the @entity29 military , said : ‘ even with the best treatments , sepsis patients are dying in intensive care units at least 30 per cent of the time			2
‘ we need a new approach			0
sepsis kills at least eight million people worldwide each year and it ’s the leading cause of hospital deaths			1
’ rather than using drugs to kill the bacteria , the solution may be to remove them from the blood			0
identifying the bug at the root of the @entity47 problem can take days – and even then the antibiotics used do n’t always work ( file photo ) dr @entity27 ’s team from the @entity52 in @entity53 have built a dialysis - like device that removes germs and poisons from the blood			1
tiny magnetic beads coated with substance that attracts numerous types of bacteria , virus and other invaders , are used to catch the germs			0
the infection - coated beads are then pulled out of the blood using a magnet and the clean blood put back into the patient			0
in tests , 90 per cent of rats treated using the ‘ biospleen ’ survived potentially deadly infections – compared to just 14 per cent of untreated animals , the journal @entity72 reports			0
dr @entity27 said : ‘ we did n’t have to kill the pathogens			0
we just captured and removed them			0
’ this saves times and means that antibiotic - resistant germs , which are becoming increasing common , should be readily combated			2
researcher dr @entity84 said : ‘ sepsis is a major medical threat , which is increasing because of antibiotic resistance			1
‘ we ’re excited about the biospleen because it potentially provides a way to treat patients quickly without having to wait days to identify the source of infection and it works equally well with antibiotic resistant organisms			2
’ he added that the hopes to start tests on people as soon as possible .			0

each year around some 37,000 @entity4 die of sepsis
sepsis is a bigger killer than breast and bowel cancer combined
identifying the bug at the root of the problem can take days
@entity47 , a major medical threat , is increasing *due* to antibiotic resistance
