around 850,000 patients in @entity30 are thought to have dementia but only half have been given a proper diagnosis			1
the government is urging @entity35 to improve their detection rates over concerns that victims and their families are struggling in silence			0
but part of the problem is that many patients are too afraid to be diagnosed so do not make an appointment in the first place			1
professor @entity46 , chairman of the neuroscience and mental health board at the @entity23 , said : ‘ the embarrassment and shame of having a disease associated with both age and mental health is a real barrier to people seeking the help they need			0
‘ a long time ago there was a stigma attached to cancer and more recently @entity8			2
in both cases it stopped people from getting treatment and that ’s sadly the case with dementia			1

with her husband she now works for the @entity91 giving talks and helping raise funding for the research			0
it describes how patients ’ friends and close relatives often distance themselves and do n’t ‘ dare ask ’ how they are			0
in some cases , the report warns that patients ’ own children stop visiting them because the deterioration is ‘ too hard to watch ’			1
and it also cites figures from a study in 2012 involving 157 dementia patients which found one in four had tried to hide their symptoms from family and friends			1
@entity112 , head of policy and public affairs at the @entity91 , which was also involved in the report said : ‘ we ’ve come a long way in terms of raising awareness but we still need to do more as a society to banish the stigma surrounding dementia once and for all			1
’ in a forward to the report , professor @entity125 , a @entity126 expert on dementia and baroness @entity128 , chairman of the @entity129 on dementia , write : ‘ we still have much to understand about why dementia remains outside the realm of acceptable conversation			1
