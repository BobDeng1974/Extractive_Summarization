at first glance , it appears as it part of the sky is missing			0
this amazing image shows a starfield over 700 light years away			1
however , part of it is blocked by a massive dust cloud - completely obscuring the telescope 's view			1
the dark cloud is called @entity13 — for @entity14 483 , and such clouds are the birthplaces of future stars			1
@entity14 483 is located about 700 light - years away in the constellation of @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1
the cloud contains enough dusty material to completely block the visible light from background stars			1
particularly dense molecular clouds , like @entity13 , qualify as dark nebulae because of this obscuring property			1
the starless nature of @entity13 and its ilk would suggest that they are sites where stars can not take root and grow			2
but in fact the opposite is true : dark nebulae offer the most fertile environments for eventual star formation			0
' some of the stars appear to be missing in this intriguing new @entity38 image , ' the @entity38 says			0
' but the black gap in this glitteringly beautiful starfield is not really a gap , but rather a region of space clogged with gas and dust			2
' the dark cloud is called @entity14 483 - for @entity14 483			1
such clouds are the birthplaces of future stars			0
the image was captured using @entity53 , an instrument mounted on the @entity56 / @entity38 2.2 - metre telescope at @entity38 's @entity57 in @entity58			0
@entity14 483 is located about 700 light - years away in the constellation of @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1

astronomers studying star formation in @entity13 have discovered some of the youngest observable kinds of baby stars buried in @entity13 ’s shrouded interior			2
these gestating stars can be thought of as still being in the womb , having not yet been born as complete , albeit immature , stars			0
in this first stage of stellar development , the star - to - be is just a ball of gas and dust contracting under the force of gravity within the surrounding molecular cloud			2
the protostar is still quite cool — about – 250 degrees @entity95 — and shines only in long - wavelength submillimetre light			0
yet temperature and pressure are beginning to increase in the fledgling star ’s core			0
@entity14 483 is located about 700 light - years away in the constellation of @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1
this earliest period of star growth lasts a mere thousands of years , an astonishingly short amount of time in astronomical terms , given that stars typically live for millions or billions of years			0
in the following stages , over the course of several million years , the protostar will grow warmer and denser			0
its emission will increase in energy along the way , graduating from mainly cold , far - infrared light to near - infrared and finally to visible light			0
the once - dim protostar will have then become a fully luminous star			0
as more and more stars emerge from the inky depths of @entity13 , the dark nebula will disperse further and lose its opacity			1
the missing background stars that are currently hidden will then come into view — but only after the passage of millions of years , and they will be outshone by the bright young - born stars in the cloud .			1
