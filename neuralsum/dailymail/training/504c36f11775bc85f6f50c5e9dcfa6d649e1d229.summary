by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 15 august 2013 when most of us go to the beach , the best souvenir we can hope for is sand in our shoes and maybe a shell or two			0
but for one little boy it was a little more exciting when a snail emerged from his knee following a trip to the beach			2
four year - old @entity14 from @entity15 in @entity16 , was left baffled when the small creature appeared after his mother @entity18 decided to squeeze his wounded knee which he had grazed after falling on rocks during a family camping holiday			1
four year - old @entity14 ( center ) was stunned when his mother @entity23 ( left ) squeezed his graze and the snail popped out			1
little brother @entity25 ( right ) , two , is excited about the new addition to the family which the boys have named turbo at first , @entity18 did n't think much of the injury which @entity14 sustained while on holiday with his family in @entity34 , @entity35			1
' it was just a little owie , ' she told the @entity37			0
' but one that kept seeping and never quite scabbed up			0
' after cleaning the wound with antibiotic liquid and applying a small bandage , she did n't think any more of it			0
but a week later , @entity14 managed to re-open the cut after falling while ice skating			1
soon , his knee became red , swollen and hot to touch			0
doctors told @entity18 that it was a staph infection , and took samples from @entity14 's knee tissue to test for dangerous viruses			1
the doctor prescribed a heavy dose of antibiotics , and sent them on their way			0
ten days later the scab was looking much better , and @entity18 thought she could put the ordeal behind her			0
it was only when @entity14 fell on his knee again that his mother knew something was wrong			2
filled with what looked like black puss , she decided the wound needed draining			0
' i know the doctors did n't want to drain it , but that sucker needed draining ! ' she said			0
the small sea snail is thought to have made its way into @entity14 's knee after he fell on a nest of snail eggs at @entity34 beach			1
@entity14 's mother @entity18 is now looking for marine biologists who will be able to tell her more to @entity23 's surprise , what emerged when she squeezed the graze was not just oozing discharge , but a little black snail			1
at first , she and @entity14 mistook the tiny creature for a rock , only realizing that it was in fact a small sea snail when they saw something moving inside its hard shell			2
@entity14 's father , @entity90 , believes the little animal made its way into his son 's leg after he fell onto a nest of snail 's eggs at the beach in @entity98			1
@entity18 is now trying to find marine biologists who will be able to tell her how such a turn of events came about			0
@entity14 , who describes the whole incident as " crazy " has since named the snail turbo			2
it now lives in a small fishbowl with the family 's other pet , a beta fish called @entity109 .			1

@entity14 , 4 , found the animal in his knee three weeks after falling on rocks during a family holiday
@entity116 *worried* he had *gangrene* after doctor 's trips and antibiotics did n't help
snail now lives in fishbowl at family home
