by @entity0 do you know a health hero ? the @entity7 , in partnership with @entity4 and @entity6 's @entity5 , is asking you to nominate special people in the health - care sector who have made a real difference to your life or a loved one 's			1
to nominate your health hero , click here here , @entity15 tells one nominee ’s story ... sitting beside her husband @entity19 as he slipped in and out of consciousness , @entity18 struggled to think clearly			1
@entity19 , 64 , had had bone - marrow cancer for the past four years , but suddenly his condition had taken a rapid turn for the worse			2
@entity24 : gp @entity25 , left , has always been there for @entity18 and her family he ’d been at home for three weeks following a five - month spell in hospital - during which time his health had rallied			1
but overnight he 'd become so ill that he 'd stopped responding to @entity18 's voice			1
' he was sleepy then he would n't wake up at all , ' recalls @entity18 , 64 , from @entity35			1
' i did n't know what to do for him or how to cope			2
it was frightening being on my own with him when he was so unwell			0
' to her huge relief , the couple 's gp , dr @entity25 , turned up unexpectedly at their front door			1
she had been making frequent out - of - hours visits to keep an eye on @entity19 , and on that particular day last october she 'd popped by after surgery had finished for the morning			2
in fact , dr @entity47 had been on hand , day and night , to help the couple cope with several major traumas over the past decade - including the sudden death of their only daughter when she was just 30 years old			1
here she was again to give medical help and emotional support when they needed it most			0
dr @entity47 examined @entity19 and explained that he was suffering from dehydration			2
because @entity18 felt too worried to keep him at home , the gp said she 'd get him into hospital to be put on a drip			1
not only that but she 'd try and get him on a ward at the town 's @entity63 , where he was known by staff - not on an impersonal general admission ward			2
@entity18 says : ' nothing is too much trouble for dr @entity47			1
she told me she would go to the surgery and sort it out and come back			0
' despite the fact the part - time gp should have finished work for the day , she returned and stayed with @entity75 for six hours while they waited for an ambulance to take @entity19 to hospital			1
' she talked to me throughout , ' says @entity18			1
' i was sitting on the sofa , crying , and she sat on the floor in front of me holding my hand			2
if she had n't been there , i do n't know what i would have done			0
beyond the call of duty : dr @entity47 has helped @entity18 through some tough times ' she has the most wonderful , calm manner			1
as soon as she came into the house , i felt supported and able to cope again			2
she told me , " you know he 's very poorly @entity18			1
" she was trying to gently prepare me for the end			0
' we had no way of knowing when a hospital bed would become available or when the ambulance would come but dr @entity47 told me not to worry - she would stay with me			2
' she was here a very , very long time , and at one point she said , " do you mind if i just phone home to let my family know i ’m ok ? " ' dr @entity47 waited with @entity18 until the ambulance arrived at 8pm			1
' then she gave me her home number and said , " i 'm on holiday next week but if you need anything just call me			0
" ... she listened to us and talked to us for ages			0
i was crying and she got up and gave me a big hug and told us she was there for us if we needed anything ' i was amazed and touched			0
i called her on the sunday and she was absolutely lovely and answered all of my concerns			0
' it was , says @entity18 , typical of the care dr @entity47 offers her patients			1
@entity18 remembers when , eight years ago , her daughter @entity115 died inexplicably of a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot in the lungs - and dr @entity47 went out of her way to support @entity18 and @entity19			1
' nothing prepares you for the pain of losing a child , ' says @entity18			1
' just six weeks after @entity115 died , @entity19 was due to have heart surgery but we thought it all might be too much for us so we went to see dr @entity47 to discuss whether we could delay it			0
' she was lovely and took a long time with us			0
then she called us at about 8pm , long after she should have gone home - to talk to us some more about how we were feeling and to tell us why she did n't think the surgery should be delayed			0
unsung heroes : nominate your medical saviour ' she asked us to come back the next week so that she could see how we were			0
and she told us to make the appointment for when the surgery had closed , so we could go in when it was empty rather than sitting in a room full of people , as she knew we were still so upset			0
' she listened to us and talked to us for ages			0
i was crying and she got up and gave me a big hug and told us she was there for us if we needed anything			0
' then , four years ago , when @entity19 was diagnosed with cancer - a type called multiple myeloma - dr @entity47 emphasised she was there for the couple whenever they needed her - not just when the surgery was open			0
' when we found out @entity19 had cancer , i was in pieces and could n't stop weeping , ' says @entity18 , who has a son , @entity154 , now 41			2
' seeing how upset we were , dr @entity47 said we should go back after the surgery had closed , so she would have the time to take us through what would happen next			0
' during the next few years , @entity19 was treated by a number of ' fantastic ' nurses and doctors - ' but none as outstanding as dr @entity47 ' , says @entity18			1
' she has such compassion , and that type of kindness makes a big difference when you are going through the pain that we were at that time			0
' ... i am @entity169 's full - time carer and i get on and do it , but it 's a lot to cope with and i do n't know what i would do without dr @entity47 after being admitted to hospital for dehydration last october , @entity19 , a former process operator for the oil industry , was transferred to a hospice			1
yet even though he was out of dr @entity47 's care , she still checked on the couple			2
' she kept ringing us at the hospice to see how we were , which was very , very comforting , ' says @entity18			2
@entity19 died on november 20 , and dr @entity47 phoned @entity18 as soon as she heard			1
' she 's never off - duty - you know she really does care , ' says @entity18			1
it 's for these reasons that @entity18 has nominated dr @entity47 for a @entity188			1
and @entity18 's not the only patient who 's been overwhelmed by the @entity191 's compassion and dedication			1
@entity193 , 75 , who ’s had several major health problems , including a heart attack and failing kidneys , says : ' it is so amazing how dr @entity47 bothers to keep tabs on you			1
she has even called me at 9pm to see how i ’m doing			0
' three years ago , when @entity193 had heart surgery , she was told by the hospital 's nurses that ' dr @entity47 was always ringing to make sure everything was ok '			2
her surgery 's hours are 8am - 6pm but she often sees patients well outside these times			0
@entity209 , 82 , whose wife @entity169 is ill with cancer and has had two strokes , says : ' dr @entity47 often calls us in the evening to see how things are , and she 'll pop in on her way home to check we are ok			0
you 'll never hear her say she has n't got time			0
' i am @entity169 's full - time carer and i get on and do it , but it 's a lot to cope with and i do n’t know what i would do without dr @entity47			1
she is an amazing doctor			0
' she will sit down and talk to us , all the time holding @entity169 's hand - making her and me feel much more reassured			2
' despite being so highly praised by her patients , dr @entity47 - who is 43 and married with a 13 - year - old daughter - insists she does ' nothing unusual '			0
talking to her , it 's clear to see why her patients admire her - her soothing , warm manner shines through			0
she tells me : ' it 's deeply flattering that @entity18 has nominated me for this award - but really i just do my job			1
' yes , i spent a lot of time with her when we were waiting for her husband to go into hospital , but i could n't have left her			0
' but @entity18 , who deeply misses @entity19 , says : ' you do get through these things - you somehow find the strength - but i do n't think i would have coped if it had n’t been for the support of dr @entity47			1
' without her this would have been so much worse			0
she 's not just a gp - she 's a woman with such a very big heart			2
