by @entity0 a pregnant doctor who saved her husband 's life by diagnosing a deadly blood poisoning condition died just hours later when she contracted the same illness			1
@entity6 said he would have died if his wife @entity7 had not suspected he had contracted sepsis after he fell ill. the cause of the illness has still not been established but the hospital is investigating			1
but as he lay recovering in hospital , just 24 hours later , he was told how how his wife was battling with the same deadly condition which would go on to claim her life and that of their unborn child			1
' it was just such a tragedy that she could n’t save her own too			2
’ mr @entity6 had woken up one morning in august 2012 feeling unwell			1
he said : ‘ i was feeling dreadful			2
i ’d woken up that morning feeling fine , but by lunchtime i was shivering violently and i felt sick			2
mr @entity6 was told his wife @entity7 was battling with the same deadly condition as he lay recovering in hospital ‘ @entity7 was 35 weeks pregnant with our second child and i had been going with her for a scan at the hospital that afternoon , but instead i went home to bed			1
‘ a few hours later she rang back			1
she said she was worried about me , and she wanted me to go and see the gp			2
by this time i was much worse			2
i could n’t eat or drink anything and i felt like i was burning up			2
‘ she came back home and drove me to the gp			1
i had to lean on her for support when i got out of the car , i was barely registering what was happening as i had a raging temperature			2
' mrs @entity51 and the @entity44 thought he was suffering from sepsis - a blood infection - so she drove him to @entity54			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ she stayed with me in the evening , but she started shivering			1
i was worried about her , but she assured me she was just cold and tired			0
she left before it got too late			0
' she was staying with her mum and dad , so she set off to drive home to their house			0
‘ by the next morning my legs were swollen and i was diagnosed with sepsis - just as @entity7 had suspected			1
‘ i was so grateful to her			0
without her quick thinking i would n’t still be here			0
it would have been too late if i had left it any later to get to hospital			0
’ but later that day , a nurse broke the news to mr @entity6 that @entity7 herself was desperately ill in hospital with an infection			1
he said : ‘ i could n’t take it in			0
i was lying in a hospital bed with an infection - and now @entity7 was too			1
but i ’d only seen her the night before when she ’d sat by my side in this hospital			0
’ mrs @entity51 had taken a turn for the worse driving home from the hospital			0
she ’d taken painkillers for a headache when she ’d arrived at her parents , but within hours they had taken her to hospital			0
doctors had n’t been able to save her unborn baby and mrs @entity51 had to be put on a ventilator			0
mr @entity6 was put into a wheelchair and taken to the hosital			1
mrs @entity51 ( pictured with her son @entity20 ) had taken a turn for the worse driving home from the hospital			0
she 'd taken painkillers for a headache when she 'd arrived at her parents , but within hours they had taken her to hospital he said : ‘ our daughter @entity95 was stillborn at 5am and as i held her in my arms it was the most ghastly moment of my life			1
just a few days ago we were both on top of the world , looking forward to our new arrival			0
now i was holding my lifeless daughter in my arms , with @entity7 fighting for her life			1
’ mrs @entity51 had haemorrhaged after the stillbirth and the infection - the same sepsis infection that had nearly claimed her husband ’s life - was now raging through her body			1
sepsis occurs when the body responds to infection , and can be caused by a huge variety of bacteria – such as @entity118 , @entity119 , streptococcus or @entity121			1
chemicals released into the blood to combat the infection trigger widespread inflammation , which leads to blood clots and leaky vessels			1
symptoms include a very high or low temperature , fast breathing , racing heartbeat , confusion or slurred speech			0
the skin may also be cool , pale or mottled , and in advanced stages the patient can lose consciousness			0
about 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis each year			1
patients with the condition occupy more than 30 per cent of intensive care unit beds			2
mr @entity6 said : ‘ there were so many doctors and nurses around her , battling to save her life			1
she was wheeled down to the operating theatre for an operation to try and stop her bleeding , but they could n’t save her			0
she had a cardiac arrest on the operating table			0
‘ i was waiting outside , desperately waiting for news of the operation			0
when the door opened and i saw the surgeon ’s face , i knew then that i had lost her			0
‘ the next few days were just a blur			0
i could n’t believe that i had to go on with my life without @entity7			1
she was the most amazing person i had ever known			0
’ mr @entity6 is now trying to get on with his life , with the couple ’s three - year - old son @entity20 , but he does n’t want his wife ’s death to be in vain			1
he said : ‘ the doctors are still investigating our cases as officially they are n’t related			2
but i ’m putting my energies into raising funds to raise more awareness of this condition			2
37,000 people die of it each year			0
‘ friends and family have stepped in to help with fundraising walks , coffee mornings and triathalons and we have managed to raise £ 25,000 so far			0
we are funding a seminar about sepsis and hope to fund more research too			2
‘ just a cut , bite or scratch can lead to sepsis developing and i would hate to think of any other family going through what i have been through			2
it ’s my duty to @entity7 to try and do something about it , and that ’s what i will do			1
