by @entity0 it has been dubbed ' @entity2 for bars '			0
@entity4 , a new @entity6 dating app , allows you to find approach people in the same bar or at the same party			1
once users have signed up and created a profile , they can see everyone near them who also has a profile			1
users can then ask to ' mingle ' with another person , and the pair can see more information about each other if they accept			2
@entity4 uses a feature called @entity27 found in apple 's latest iphone software			2
this uses low energy bluetooth to send messages over short distances , and is usually found in shops or sports stadiums , where it is increasingly being used to send messages and communicate with customers			1
for instance , in @entity40 , customers can be automatically told when their @entity43 appointment is ready to start , or be shown special offers or in which part of the store a particular product is in			0
the firm 's two founders , said the app actually started out as a side project created by the 24 - year old @entity54 grads , @entity55 and @entity56			1
' it ’s an easy , low - key way to break the ice with the people literally around you and find out who wants to meet you , ' the pair explain on their web site			1
' when we set out to design and create @entity4 in november of 2013 , we wanted to create an app that enhanced rather than replaced the way in which we meet new people			2
' though there are a number of social location - based apps and even more online dating sites , we felt there was still significant room for improvement			0
' the app is designed to let people in the same bar introduces themselves to others virtually to see if they are interested , and has been dubbed ' @entity2 for bars ' the pair say one key problem was people lying online about their appearance			0
' it ’s a lot easier to misrepresent your physical appearance online than in person			0
' this is why we aimed to design the app in a way that encourages users to first see someone they find interesting in real life and then use the app to find out if that person is also interested in them			1
' the app allows allows people to meet quickly			0
' having tried our hand at online dating , we definitely understand how disappointing it can be to spend all that time sending messages back and forth only to meet in person and recognize the two of you do n’t have chemistry			0
