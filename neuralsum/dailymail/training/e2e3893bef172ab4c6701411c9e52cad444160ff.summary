@entity0 : the researchers have resurrected a 500 - million - year - old gene and inserted it into a modern @entity4 bacteria a 500 million - year - old bacteria has been brought back to life in a laboratory at @entity8 in an experiment with echoes of @entity12 's disastrous recreation of the dinosaurs			1
the researchers have resurrected a 500 - million - year - old gene and inserted it into a modern @entity4 bacteria			1
the ' @entity18 ' germ has thrived			1
in the lab , the creation has now lived through 1,000 generations			0
the scientists hope to find out whether the ' ancient ' bacteria will evolve the same way it did ' first time round ' - or whether it will evolve into a different , new organism			1
‘ this is as close as we can get to rewinding and replaying the molecular tape of life , ’ said scientist @entity28 , a @entity29 astrobiology postdoctoral fellow in @entity8 the new ' chimeric ' bacteria has mutated rapidly - and some have become stronger and healthier than today 's germs			1
‘ the ability to observe an ancient gene in a modern organism as it evolves within a modern cell allows us to see whether the evolutionary trajectory once taken will repeat itself or whether a life will adapt following a different path			0
’ ‘ the altered organism was n’t as healthy or fit as its modern - day version , at least initially , ’ said @entity46 , ‘ and this created a perfect scenario that would allow the altered organism to adapt and become more fit as it accumulated mutations with each passing day			0
’ the growth rate eventually increased and , after the first 500 generations , the scientists sequenced the genomes of all eight lineages to determine how the bacteria adapted			2
new life : the bacteria with the ancient genes have thrived , and are now in their 1000th generation ¿ the altered organism wasn ¿ t as healthy or fit as its modern - day version , at least initially , @entity61 said @entity46 , ¿ and this created a perfect scenario that would allow the altered organism to adapt and become more fit as it accumulated mutations with each passing day			2
¿ the experiment has echoes of @entity67 's @entity12 , where scientists recreated dinosaurs using ancient dna not only did the fitness levels increase to nearly modern - day levels , but also some of the altered lineages actually became healthier than their modern @entity77 the researchers looked closer , they noticed that every @entity79 gene did not accumulate mutations			2
instead , the modern proteins that interact with the ancient @entity79 inside of the bacteria had mutated and these mutations were responsible for the rapid adaptation that increased the bacteria ’s fitness			0
in short , the ancient gene has not yet mutated to become more similar to its modern form , but rather , the bacteria found a new evolutionary trajectory to @entity93 results were presented at the recent @entity94			2
the scientists will continue to study new generations , waiting to see if the protein will follow its historical path or whether it will adopt via a novel path altogether			0
‘ we think that this process will allow us to address several longstanding questions in evolutionary and molecular biology , ’ said @entity28			0
‘ among them , we want to know if an organism ’s history limits its future and if evolution always leads to a single , defined point or whether evolution has multiple solutions to a given problem			0

' @entity18 ' germ *spliced* with gene from 500 - million - year - old bacteria
bacteria is now thriving in lab
some of the ' chimeric ' @entity4 is now stronger than *normal* bacteria
scientists hope to ' *restage* ' evolution
will answer questions about how and why organisms evolve
