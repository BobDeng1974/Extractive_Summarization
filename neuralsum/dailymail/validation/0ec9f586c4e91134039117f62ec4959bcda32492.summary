independent economists such as @entity1 have urged both the @entity2 and @entity3 to be more straightforward about spending plans independent economists have urged both the @entity2 and @entity3 to be more straightforward with voters about their post-election tax and spending plans			1
researchers from the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said that @entity11 should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by £ 12billion			1
they also said that @entity3 ’s ideas to deal with @entity15 ’s deficit were ‘ less explicit ’ than the other main parties , and could see @entity16 rack up tens of billions a year in borrowing			1
yesterday @entity10 director @entity19 criticised both the major parties over their lack of clarity ahead of may ’s general election			1
referring to the chancellor ’s planned £ 12billion in welfare cuts , he said : ‘ it is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by £ 12billion			1
it ’s time we knew more about what that might actually involve			0
’ the chancellor signalled yesterday that a future @entity36 government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years from 2016			0
the freeze , which would not include pensions , disability benefits and maternity pay , would save £ 3billion			2
last week the @entity44 also revealed that other measures likely to be included in the @entity36 manifesto include restricting child benefit to three children for new claimants , cutting the cap on welfare claims from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 per household and removing the right of under - 25s to housing benefit and jobless payouts if they refuse offers of work , training or education			1
researchers from the @entity10 said that @entity11 should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by £ 12billion multi-billion pound plans to ‘ revolutionise ’ travel in the @entity65 will be unveiled today			1
part of @entity11 ’s ‘ @entity69 ’ strategy , they include new rail routes that could see 140mph trains reduce @entity72 to @entity74 journey times to around 20 minutes			1
a so - called ‘ @entity75 ’ rail network would link @entity72 , @entity74 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
the @entity72 - @entity74 route could cost as much as £ 13billion , while a plan to reduce journey times between @entity78 and @entity74 from the 48 to 27 minutes could cost up to £ 19billion			2
other plans include new east - west road connections and introducing @entity87 - style travel cards across the @entity65			2
however even those measures would fall well short of the £ 12billion mr @entity11 needs to find			1
yesterday @entity10 economist @entity1 also warned that @entity3 ’s rules were so loose that the party could end austerity next year and open the public spending tap again			1
she claimed that @entity3 could increase real - term spending by more than £ 9billion a year by 2020 , compared to @entity36 plans to lower it by £ 14billion by that point			1
@entity3 has promised that it will balance day - to - day spending at some point during the next @entity98 , but has not yet specified when that will be			1
and unlike the @entity36 , the party has not committed to balancing all government spending – leaving it free to borrow tens of billions for ‘ investment ’			2
this means that under @entity3 , @entity15 ’s £ 1.5trillion national debt could continue to grow indefinitely , while the @entity2 would begin to pay it off by the end of the next parliament – meeting @entity109 ’s pledge to ‘ fix the roof while the sun shines ’			1

unchanged since 2009 , it is charged at 40 per cent of the value of any estate above £ 325,000 , or £ 650,000 for a couple with a joint estate			0
the figures come after it emerged the @entity36 are considering raising the threshold in its election manifesto			0
@entity11 ’s tax boost for orchestras fell flat yesterday when mps claimed brass bands could be excluded			2
a consultation paper published in january suggested that to qualify , ensembles would have to include string , woodwind , brass and percussion sections			0
but @entity3 said it would leave out brass bands popular in the @entity65 and swiftly branded the policy a ‘ trumpet tax ’			2
@entity3 said @entity11 's tax boost for orchestras would exclude brass bands ( file picture ) @entity151 culture minister @entity150 said it would exclude string orchestras like the @entity153 and accused @entity11 of being ‘ out of tune ’			1

it said the 25 per cent tax relief from next year will apply to any group of 12 or more musicians playing instruments in any of the four orchestral sections			0

chief economist @entity167 said rates may need to be cut again – having been frozen at 0.5 per cent for more than six years – if inflation threatened to stay too low for too long after it tumbled to 0.3 per cent – its lowest level since 1960			0
his intervention sent sterling tumbling on global currency markets and came days after bank governor @entity174 said a cut would be ‘ extremely foolish ’			0
