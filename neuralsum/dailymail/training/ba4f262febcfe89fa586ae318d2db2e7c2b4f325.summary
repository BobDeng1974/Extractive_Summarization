@entity0 finished their autumn series in memorable fashion as a powerful forward effort , guided by excellent control from the half - backs , secured a deserved 26 - 17 win			1
attention will now turn to @entity0 's @entity9 opener against @entity10 at the @entity11 in february as @entity13 's side look to build on this impressive display			1
here , @entity15 looks at five things @entity0 learned from the match			2
@entity18 after stuttering displays against @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 over the last few weeks , @entity0 produced their most fluid and organised performance of the autumn against @entity25			1
the build - up to both of @entity29 ’s tries summed up @entity0 ’s ruthless approach at @entity31			1
for @entity29 ’s first , @entity0 drove from the lineout with @entity33 running straight and hard to set up a strong platform at the ruck			1
@entity36 then released the onrushing @entity37 who supplied the deftest of passes to @entity29 to barrel over			1
@entity29 powered over from close range for @entity0 ’s second after the pack demolished the @entity25 at scrum time			1
it ’s worth remembering , however , that the set - piece came about from @entity48 ’s intelligent kick and @entity50 ’s superb chase that forced @entity51 to carry the ball into his own in - goal area			0
simple , efficient and direct rugby			0
that ’s the way forward for @entity0			2
@entity29 powers through the tackle of @entity58 ( right ) to score @entity0 's opening try @entity61 steel to @entity62 the @entity25 pack had a torrid day at @entity31 , but @entity65 ’s cameo will have pleased @entity66			1
@entity69 - born @entity68 tips the scales at 135kg and used @entity0 replacement lock @entity71 as a speed bump in the lead - up to his second - half try			1
the 22 - year - old developed under the watchful eye of @entity66 at the @entity76 and featured for the @entity78 franchise against the @entity79 in 2013			0
@entity68 exploded onto the international scene with a @entity82 display on his @entity25 debut against @entity84 in june			1
the monster second row barrelled over @entity88 flanker @entity87 to register his first try in that game before showing deft hands to release @entity92 for another score to cap off a sensational debut			0
@entity68 has played a more subtle role for the @entity25 on this tour , but there is no question that he is rising talent in the global game			2
amazingly , @entity68 is not the biggest member of his family			2
his 19 - year - old brother @entity103 is 10kgs heavier and has recently taken up a lucrative offer with the @entity105 in @entity20			0
wallabies lock @entity68 crashes over @entity0 replacement lock @entity71 to score at @entity31 @entity108 strikes @entity109 less than 10 months out from next year ’s @entity111 , @entity13 ’s @entity0 side now have a serious mental edge over the wounded @entity25			1
@entity25 are a fabulous side to watch with @entity92 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 running riot at @entity31 , but @entity25 ’s deficiencies up front were once again exposed			0
these two sides will look horns again in a crucial @entity123 clash in @entity124 at next year ’s @entity111			0
if the @entity0 pack can do this to @entity25 now			1
imagine what they can do when they get @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 back from injury			0
a shuddering thought for @entity66			0
the @entity25 coach has a serious repair job on his hands ; both mentally and technically			0
the @entity0 scrum will cause @entity66 many sleepless nights in the coming months @entity140 bites back @entity0 ’s backrow triumvirate of @entity37 , captain @entity142 and @entity29 have come in for heavy criticism in recent weeks			1
the trio answered their critics with aplomb against the @entity25			0
@entity37 showcased his superb aerial skills fielding several kick - offs while providing @entity0 with a superb option at the tail of the lineout			1
the @entity153 flanker also showed up well in the loose			0
@entity142 was challenged by the @entity0 management during the week to have more of a presence at the breakdown and the @entity158 skipper delivered in spades			2
@entity142 made two crucial turnovers , contributed 14 tackles and outshone his opposite number @entity58 which is no mean feat. @entity29 has surely cemented his place for the @entity9 opener against @entity10 next february after this powerful display			1
the @entity167 number eight provided the attacking ballast that @entity0 have craved in this series and made 13 tackles to boot			0
@entity153 and @entity0 blindside @entity37 feeds @entity36 after a clean take at lineout time @entity142 ( centre ) celebrates victory with props @entity178 ( left ) and @entity179 @entity180 is a leading light all blacks lock @entity183 has recently been named the world ’s best player , but @entity180 is not far behind him			1
@entity180 was everywhere for @entity0 once again at @entity31			2
the @entity187 player has a staggering workrate and has become one of his country ’s most important players			0
@entity180 demonstrated his athleticism with a crucial try - saving tackle on @entity115 early in the first half while he also showed incredible pace to chase down @entity92 after the break			2
@entity180 left the field in the 54th minute a spent force having made 12 tackles in less than an hour			0
he simply had no more left to give			0
a world - class talent			0
@entity0 head coach @entity13 ( right ) congratulates @entity180 on a job well done			2

@entity68 impresses for @entity25 off the bench
