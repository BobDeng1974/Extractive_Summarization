a ' vulnerable ' young girl questioned by police investigating the @entity4 child sex ring has lifted the lid on a second gang operating in the area , it emerged last night			1
the teenager has told officers she was abused by a different group of men from the nine jailed last week over the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 13			1
her claims have led to the arrest of nine men , aged between 24 and 38 , all from @entity4 , on suspicion of sexual activity with a child			1
the first @entity20 scandal : eight of the nine men who were jailed this week following an investigation into what police say appears to be an entirely separate sex grooming ring			1
the ninth man can not be identified for legal reasons shockwaves : police guard @entity29 during the trial in which nine men from @entity4 were jailed for grooming underage girls for sex			1
just a few days later , officers believe they have arrested members of a second ring judge @entity37 : condemned the first gang jailed last week and suggested they deliberately targeted girls outside their community concern : @entity4 's @entity43 mp @entity42 says he fears last week 's conviction was not a one - off case and that sexual exploitation is a wider issue in the @entity49 area @entity50 said the latest claims relate to abuse which is alleged to have taken place over a six - year period , beginning in 2005			1
the men are thought to be from @entity57 and @entity58 backgrounds			0
they are not believed to know one another or those convicted in the previous case			0
police sources have described the girl , who told officers she knew the men by their nicknames only , as ‘ extremely vulnerable ’			2
it is understood officers have carried out sensitive video interviews with the girl , who is believed to be one of 47 identified by police investigating the original case as a victim of sexual abuse			1
last wednesday nine @entity57 men received jail sentences of between four and 19 years after being convicted of repeatedly abusing five white girls , aged between 13 and 15 , in 2008 and 2009			0
the convictions marked the conclusion of one of the largest investigations into child sexual exploitation ever undertaken in @entity84			2

the men were convicted of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children under the age of 16 and other sexual offences including rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation			1
the case has sparked a national debate over whether religion and culture played a role in the @entity107 and @entity108 men ’s targeting of vulnerable white girls			2
the judge , @entity37 , suggested the men targeted their victims because they were ‘ not of your community or religion ’			0
but police and political leaders have denied the crimes were about race – insisting the men had targeted the girls simply because they were vulnerable			2

’ a file of evidence on the latest arrests is expected to be handed over to the @entity130 within a few weeks			0
