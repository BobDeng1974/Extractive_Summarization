the brother of honeymoon murder victim @entity1 today made an emotional appeal for her husband to be forced to ' tell the world ' how she died			1
with his sister 's photograph pinned to his jacket , @entity10 , 25 , said @entity11 should not be allowed to ' walk away ' without revealing in his own words how she met her death			2
@entity1 , who has been on trial since early october accused of his wife 's murder , has lodged a bid to be freed next week claiming there is insufficient evidence against him for the trial to continue and the charges should be thrown out			1
judge @entity25 will deliver her decision on monday on whether she agrees that @entity1 has no case to answer or whether there is enough evidence for the case to continue			2
despite glaring variations in his version of events leading up to , and after , his wife 's fatal shooting two weeks after their wedding , @entity1 is next week widely expected to be cleared of having any hand in it			2
but @entity10 , who has been supporting his parents in @entity43 since the first day of the trial , said : ' it would be a terrible development to what has been a four - year wait , if we and the people of @entity51 are not afforded the full story			1
' scroll down for exclusive video ' give us the full story ' : @entity11 's brother @entity10 ( pictured , left , with his sister @entity56 , centre , and parents @entity59 and @entity60 , behind , at a court hearing last year ) made an emotional appeal for her husband to be forced to explain how she died he said @entity1 's counsel @entity63 had told the court repeatedly that the accused would explain to the court his version of events			1
@entity10 said : ' the phrase " my client will tell the court " has become like a mantra to the judge , media and members of the public who have attended the @entity75			2
' @entity11 has insisted all along that he would clear his name and his legal team have promised the court since the trial began dozens of times that he would help the court with his own version of events			0
' well , let 's have him " tell the court " then			0
that has been his pledge throughout the trial			0
' it would be wrong for him to walk away from @entity51 without explaining himself what happened on the night of @entity1 's murder in this country			1

' we can not thank them enough for the warmth they have shown us and we really appreciate it			0

unaware : @entity120 , who is recovering from stomach cancer , said : ' if i knew @entity11 was gay or bisexual i would never have allowed @entity1 to get married ' back in court : speaking for the first time since the trial began , @entity124 ( pictured ) said he intends to pursue the civil action against @entity1 in @entity128 , but stressed it was not financially motivated version : @entity1 's parents said they will struggle to find closure if they do not hear @entity133 ( pictured earlier in the trial ) giving evidence in court ' if the full facts are not given and by that i mean @entity11 telling the court his version , than @entity1 's death will remain on the conscience of @entity51 forever			1
' it will also mean a lifetime of further torture for me and my family , particularly my parents			2
' @entity1 's parents revealed to @entity147 earlier this week that they were unaware of their son - in - law 's secret trysts with male prostitutes , including one called @entity151 , which he confessed to on the first day of the trial while also admitting he was bisexual			1
they declared they would not have agreed to the marriage and @entity1 herself would have walked away if the facts of his sexuality and meetings with male prostitutes had been revealed			2
they are also set to examine taking legal action against him once the criminal case has been completed			0
@entity10 added : ' there have been reports that we as a family are planning to take legal action of our own and sue @entity11 after this murder trial is over			1
' this is not the right time to discuss this			0
however , our motivation is not , and never has been financial			0
we just demand the truth			0
' and we do that with heavy hearts after such a long time			0
' @entity1 , who had been married less than a fortnight after their £ 200,000 wedding , died from a single gunshot to the neck as she was driven through @entity179 , part of a run - down suburb , with her husband in a taxi in november 2010			2

in the dark : mr and mrs @entity120 ( pictured in @entity43 last week ) revealed they were totally unaware that @entity1 was bisexual and slept with gay prostitutes until details of his secret sex life were emerged in court claims : police say @entity1 ( striped shirt ) masterminded the murder of @entity1 ( right ) , but he denies the charge accusing the three killers of concocting a yarn to reduce their own prison terms of at least 25 years @entity11 told the @entity43 court that he had hired a @entity128 prostitute , who went under the name the @entity240 master ( pictured ) , for sexual liaisons he was returned in april by a private charter plane and is being detained in a secure hospital wing			1
he denies any involvement in the murder and insists he has been set up by the killers and was deeply in love with his wife			0
mr @entity151 and a senior @entity250 officer were banned by the judge from revealing details of @entity1 's homosexual activities as they were about to give the evidence from the witness box			1
@entity10 added : ' i fully expect the @entity51 trail against @entity11 to continue and for his application to end the case to be rejected			1
' we have been made aware that there has been a petition against the judge in the this case and we would like to point out that it has nothing to do with our own case for justice and the full story we want			1

' millionaire businessman @entity11 ( pictured arriving at court earlier in the trial ) is said to have already packed his bags in the expectation that a judge will find in his favour over his claim that he should walk free because of a lack of evidence without being forced into the witness box and cross-examination			0

@entity10 makes emotional appeal for businessman to testify at trial
insists it would be ' terrible ' if he left @entity51 without giving ' full story '
he said : ' if facts are n't given , it will mean a lifetime of torture for our family '
@entity1 's bid to have murder charge thrown out appears likely to succeed
