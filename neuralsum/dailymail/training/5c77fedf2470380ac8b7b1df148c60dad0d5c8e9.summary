at least two of them died and a further 121 may have suffered life - threatening delays in diagnosis or treatment			1
a major probe has been launched into how the clerical errors went undetected for three years			0
@entity13 say they want managers at @entity16 trust to be held to account			1
it emerged last night that the man who was in charge at the time quit the @entity21 just as the problems were coming to light			1
two managers have been suspended after a hospital trust admitted discharging hundreds of suspected cancer patients by mistake			1
@entity28 said at least one person might have died as a result of the errors and 121 patients are yet to have their cases reviewed @entity34 , who had moved on to @entity35 , suddenly left the @entity37 hospital in december , saying he wanted to pursue ‘ other opportunities ’			1
he takes with him a £ 3million taxpayer - funded pension pot. the mistakes affected 810 patients urgently referred to the @entity43 trust for tests between 2010 and 2013 because their gp feared they had cancer			1
none turned up for their initial examinations however , possibly because they did not receive appointment letters			0
given the urgency of their cases , staff should have contacted them immediately to arrange another slot			0
instead , it is thought they were removed from the computer system with no further action taken			0
the blunders made some patients wait several weeks for diagnosis – with fatal results in two cases			2
@entity34 , who had moved on to @entity35 , suddenly left the @entity37 hospital in december , saying he wanted to pursue ' other opportunities ' a review by the trust , which runs @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 hospitals , found that 686 people were not harmed by the delays			1
it is investigating other 121 cases and speaking to doctors and relatives			2
the mistakes came to light in november when @entity79 , who took over from mr @entity34 as chief executive last february , asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments			1
a few weeks later , mr @entity34 , 62 , announced he was going to retire just a year into his @entity35 posting			1
the married father of two gave up a £ 280,000 annual salary , saying he wanted to focus on @entity16 consultancy and business books			1
he was handed a retirement lump sum payment of £ 412,000 on top of his £ 140,000 - a - year pension – one of the most generous in the public sector			2
the mistakes came to light in november when @entity79 , who took over from mr @entity34 as chief executive last february , asked for a review of the system for booking cancer appointments miss @entity79 said : ‘ it is absolutely clear that the trust was not always following the correct administrative processes for these patients and we let them down			1
‘ these concerns date back a number of years and were identified as part of the new management team ’s commitment to improve the way we administer and manage patient care			0
‘ i would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected and particularly to the relatives of those who have since died			0
‘ we have of course made significant changes to help prevent this ever happening again and will share the outcome of our investigations with those affected and with the wider public			0
’ a spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether mr @entity34 was at fault – but confirmed that two managers had been suspended			1
@entity128 , @entity129 mp for @entity68 , said : ‘ there is absolutely no doubt that the trust ’s failure to follow the correct administrative process for urgent referrals is unacceptable , and deeply wrong			2
’ he has written a statement with four other local mps calling for proper accountability of senior bosses once the investigation has finished			0
@entity141 , @entity129 mp for @entity69 , said : ‘ this is an extremely worrying situation which may have health implications for my constituents			0
' frankly , the public deserve better when it comes to the @entity16			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity43 trust could not explain why the patients had not turned up for their appointments			0
he said in some cases letters may have been lost in the post , others may not have been told of the urgency by their gp , while others may have just forgotten to attend			0
an investigation has since been launched – overseen by @entity159 , of the @entity161 campaign – which will try to establish exactly how many people were affected			0
speaking from his £ 1.3million home in @entity164 , @entity37 , last night mr @entity34 said : ‘ i ’m not prepared to comment having no knowledge about the issues and it being some time since i left the trust			1
i will try to find something out about this			0
’ there is widespread evidence that cancer patients in @entity173 are less likely to survive than those elsewhere in @entity174 due to delays in diagnosis and treatment .			2

a further 121 may have suffered life - threatening delays in diagnosis
