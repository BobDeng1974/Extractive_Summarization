paying a player northwards of £ 100,000 a week to be an occasional impact sub off the bench is an expensive business , even for a side who have @entity7 title aspirations			1
and , judging by @entity9 ’s decision to leave him sat in his tracksuit throughout the entirety of the 2 - 1 victory over @entity13 , @entity14 seems to have become just that at @entity15			1
indeed there was , for portions of this match , a sense that @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 could form a clinical strike force in the @entity7 for years to come – while @entity14 warmed up on the touchline			1
yet , even in the second half when things were not going right for @entity15 and they needed a spark to reignite them , @entity9 instead turned to @entity29 ahead of @entity14 to give some added impetus			1
and , as much as @entity14 will have enjoyed seeing his side keep the pressure up on second - placed @entity34 , you ca n’t help but feel the @entity35 forward must be contemplating lowering his reported wage demands if he wants to stay at the @entity37			0
@entity14 has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over £ 100,000 a week the @entity35 international was left on the bench for the game against @entity13 and did n't feature @entity46 and @entity14 have both found their chances limited this for @entity15 this season because , put simply , where do you fit him into this @entity52 side ? @entity20 is on fire and is leading the line superbly – he has scored 11 goals in 12 @entity7 starts this season after his two at @entity58 ’ – @entity22 caused problems all afternoon , contributing an assist for the first and he also should have netted at least twice , while @entity21 , although visibly tired , was still able to produce that little bit of magic to keep the @entity52 on the front foot			1
@entity14 is not an automatic selection anymore , and therefore he can not be too ambitious with his wage demands			0
@entity15 ’s form is superb – they have won 14 of 16 games since @entity69 – and they have achieved that largely without @entity14 ’s presence			2
the 26 - year - old – yes , he is really still that young – has started just three top - flight games all season after returning from injury , and the @entity52 have n’t exactly missed him			0
2014/15 - all competitions 11 appearances ( 5 starts ) , 3 goals overall - all competitions 294 appearances ( 190 starts ) , 72 goals right now the @entity52 are playing with pace and panache – displayed perfectly when @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity82 combined to take @entity15 from one side of the field to the other , only for @entity85 to make a timely interception			1
this was just one example of when @entity15 ’s front men wreaked havoc in an awesome first - half display			0
yet , despite that , their goals at @entity92 came from a direct source			0
@entity20 loves scoring against @entity13 anyway , and now has eight in seven against them , but the way he calmly kneed in his first after @entity22 ’s flick - on highlights a player with confidence			2
his second was also a decent header , although he did n’t even have to jump off the ground so feeble was the challenge offered up by @entity85			0
unfortunately for @entity14 , height and an aerial presence will make @entity20 first - choice centre forward every time			2
@entity21 ( left ) has been a revelation since signing for the club from @entity111 in the summer @entity20 ( 12 ) scored an impressive double at @entity92 to continue his excellent form despite returning from a serious injury , @entity14 has struggled to earn a place in @entity9 's starting 11 @entity22 offers an abundance of pace and energy and can play anywhere across the front three , while @entity21 on his day is simply world class			1
they may not have been at their absolute best against @entity13 , but they got the job done			0
but on saying all of that , if @entity9 does not offer @entity14 a new deal then he risks losing a player with more than 200 games ’ worth of @entity7 experience and 47 strikes in @entity35 ’s top flight to one of his rivals			0
is he really willing to risk that ? perhaps though , given @entity14 ’s shocking injury record , @entity9 thinks he has replaced one ‘ w ’ for another – with the £ 16million acquisition of @entity22 increasingly looking like a piece of shrewd business by the @entity139			1
will @entity14 or @entity9 blink first in this latest of many contract disputes the @entity35 winger seems to have had with the club ? on the basis of saturday ’s match , you get the impression the @entity35 striker may be knocking on the manager ’s door with his tail between his legs sometime soon			2
@entity22 ( right ) terrorised the @entity13 defence with his pace and looks to be settling in well			0

@entity14 wants his new contract to pay over £ 100,000 a week
@entity20 , @entity22 and @entity21 are beginning to form an *exciting* *partnership* and were impressive against @entity13
@entity9 wants to keep @entity14 but has *bulked* at his demands
