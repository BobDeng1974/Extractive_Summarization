no need for maternity clothes ! @entity24 chose the slim - fitting , belted brown @entity8 coat from @entity27 store @entity4 for today 's visit to @entity29 - and managed to fasten the belt around her slim midriff despite being almost six months pregnant thrifty : @entity24 wore a brown coat that we saw on @entity17 last year for the visit today then , she paired the coat with a warm black sweater dress			1
today though , despite the mercury resting at a chilly three degrees centigrade , the duchess wore a lower - cut top , the lace trim just showing at the v - neck of the coat.related ] the only difference between today 's styling and that of 2012 was in the positioning of the belt			1
today it was a fraction higher than it was last year , and the fabric was gently filled out by @entity24 's neat bump			2

@entity24 last wore the coat on @entity17 2012 - and an hour later the coat , which had been discounted to £ 182 , had sold out on the @entity4 website			1
the chestnut brown coat was the perfect fit for the slender @entity1 - a muted chocolate tone and simple , classic cut meaning the focus could remain on her work for the day rather than her choice of outfit			0
the single - breasted style was nothing high fashion or too trendy - but it was given a contemporary edge with stud - fastening cuff straps and a leather belt			0
