this may have been a routine victory for @entity2 , but the playmaking ability of @entity4 was there for all at @entity6 to see			1
with his short - corner delivery for @entity11 ’s goal , the @entity8 midfielder registered his 10th league assist of the season - more than any other @entity2 player since the start of last season			1
for a man who looks so effortless in his play , it ’s some achievement			0
@entity2 midfielder @entity4 yet again put in a star performance at @entity6 @entity4 was the man helping @entity20 , @entity11 , @entity21 and @entity22 as @entity2 stormed to victory of course , the former @entity25 man is aided by the surfeit of attacking players making probing runs in front of him – namely @entity20 , @entity11 , @entity21 and @entity22 – but picking the right option must be easier said than done			1
there was n’t anything particularly flashy about @entity2 ’s attacks against @entity35 – most of them started with the visitors losing possession from a goal kick – but @entity4 played his role to perfection			1
@entity41 or one of the centre halves would win the aerial battle and immediately look for @entity4 , who was never too far away and usually unmarked			0
@entity2 ’s @entity44 would then bring the ball forward and pick out one of the four forward players , whose movement completely befuddled @entity35 ’s rearguard all afternoon			0
but in truth , @entity4 makes eye - of - the - needle through balls and long - range deliveries look easy			2
@entity4 celebrates with hazard after the latter put @entity2 2 - 0 up en route to their easy win on saturday fabregas played his role to perfection as @entity2 beat @entity35 at @entity6 @entity61 pictured in 2002 , the year he set the new record for the most assists in the @entity64 despite spending much of his time at @entity68 wasted as a false nine , it ’s clear @entity4 ’s best position is a deep - lying playmaker , rarely even entering the opponent ’s penalty area			1
his assist stats certainly back this up			0
his total of 10 is three more than his nearest challenger , @entity77 ’s @entity76 , and is half way to @entity61 ’s record haul of 20 in the 2002/03 season			1
with only 12 games gone , @entity4 looks well on his way to breaking his former @entity25 team - mate ’s record			1
he could easily have moved a few notches closer if it were n’t for the heroics of @entity35 keeper @entity88			0
towards the end of the first half , with the game essentially won , @entity4 ’s creative instinct showed no sign of letting up			0
@entity35 had retreated into ultra-defensive mode and with @entity11 , @entity21 and @entity22 all well - covered , the @entity8 midfielder found right back @entity96 with a beautifully - weighted through ball			0
@entity4 ’s creative instinct showed no sign of letting up , even with @entity2 comfortably winning the @entity99 squared the ball to fellow full back @entity101 , who had broken into the left of the box and clear of @entity35 ’s back line , but @entity88 flew at the feet of the left back to push the ball out for a corner			2
it may not have amounted to a goal , but that particular move , which came after a series of inch - perfect long balls from @entity4 , illustrated his versatility perfectly			2
it ’s somewhat odd that the simple short - corner routine that preceded @entity11 ’s goal should be the one @entity4 pass that resulted in an assist for the @entity124 , after his numerous defence - splitting and cross-field balls – practically all of which found their intended target			0
but while the 27 - year - old is taking corners , getting a free run of midfield and finding his attacking team - mates with such regularity , he looks a shoo - in to topple @entity61 ’s 11 - year - old record			2
fabregas of @entity2 and @entity134 of @entity35 swap shirts at full time after the 2 - 0 win @entity4 's heat map from @entity6			1
