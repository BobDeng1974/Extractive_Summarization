by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 and @entity4 are set to do battle over @entity7 teen sensation @entity6			1
the fierce rivals were among those paying close attention to the 15 - year - old 's international debut this week			1
@entity6 became his country ’s youngest - ever player when he appeared against the @entity15			2
easy to forget he 's only 15 : but perhaps not when @entity6 's age is also his shirt number but the secret is out on the @entity20 midfielder and the @entity22 sides were joined by @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 in the stands at @entity27			1
the @entity29 heavyweights will again be in attendance when @entity6 and @entity31 face @entity32 at @entity33 next week			1
@entity34 to seal £ 10m club record move to @entity36 @entity34 will complete his move to @entity36 on friday but a work - permit hearing means he is unlikely to be available for the weekend			1
a fee approaching £ 10million – a club record - has been agreed for the @entity42 striker but he still needs the necessary paperwork before the deal is done			2
in the pink : but red tape is set to make @entity34 ( left ) wait for his @entity36 debut against the clock : @entity49 must find cover for injured @entity51 before the window shuts @entity34 – who has completed a medical and agreed personal terms - has been capped 14 times by @entity56 and was part of their squad at the @entity60 in @entity61 , so manager @entity49 does not envisage any problems in that respect			1
the delay , however , means he will miss sunday ’s trip to @entity66			2
meanwhile , @entity49 is still looking to replace the injured @entity51 and @entity68 ’s @entity67 is on a shortlist along with @entity3 's @entity70			2
one in , one out at the back for @entity72 @entity72 defender @entity73 is set for a return to @entity75 – and that should pave the way for the arrival of @entity80 ’s @entity79			0
@entity82 club @entity81 want @entity73 and they are in talks with the @entity72 over a fee , thought to be nominal given his free - transfer signing from @entity87 last summer			0
transfer tussle : @entity80 defender @entity79 attracting attention at @entity72 and @entity90 @entity72 boss @entity91 will immediately look to replace @entity73 with @entity94 centre half @entity92			0
@entity80 are willing to sell the 23 - year - old and he was offered to @entity96 last week			1
they are holding out for a fee of £ 8m but , given their failure to qualify for the @entity99 , they are likely to accept £ 6m			0
@entity100 set for a date at the @entity102 @entity100 is set to choose @entity102 over @entity103			0
the @entity104 have made a £ 7m approach for the @entity107 midfielder but @entity102 have also entered the race and @entity109 is his likely destination			0
@entity112 winger @entity111 will sign for @entity113 in a £ 2m deal			0
@entity113 are in discussion with the @entity116 and he is set to become their 11th signing of the summer .			0

@entity6 is wanted by @entity4 and @entity3
the 15 - year - old is being tracked by @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25
he made his @entity31 debut against @entity15 this week
@entity31 play @entity32 in a *friendly* at @entity33 next week
@entity34 is set to join @entity36 but a work permit could delay his debut
