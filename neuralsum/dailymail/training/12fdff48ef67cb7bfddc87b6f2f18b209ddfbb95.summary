by @entity0 @entity1 and his father , @entity2 : the pair , who found Â£ 10,000 in a hotel room last year , wo n't be able to keep the cash because of an obscure law a 10 - year - old boy who found $ 10,000 hidden in a drawer in a @entity11 hotel room wo n't get to keep it even though no - one has come forward to claim the cash			1
@entity1 and his father @entity2 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , failed to comply with the tortuous requirements of a 1939 @entity20 law that stipulates how to claim lost money			1
after finding the money , in non-consecutive $ 100 bills still bound in money wrappers , in may last year , @entity1 and @entity2 immediately handed it over to police			1
but , according to the law , they then had to file an affidavit with a state court within 10 days stating where and when they found it			2
other steps included tacking a list to the courthouse door and four other public places in the city , as well as publishing adverts in a local newspaper for three consecutive weeks			0
so , despite the fact that mr @entity42 and his son 's discovery generated news headlines across @entity46 and beyond , more than meeting the spirit of the law , they failed to comply with the letter of it			2
now experts say that it is unlikely that the family will be able to keep the cash , which is still sitting in a safe at the @entity56			0
the police said no one has come forward to claim the large sum of money and they suspect that 's because it is tied to something illicit			0
if an owner has n't come forward after four more years , reports the @entity65 , police will hand the money over to the state treasurer 's office , where it will be kep in trust forever if an owner does n't come forward			0
but that was not enough , although no - one has claimed it the @entity80 in @entity11 : @entity1 found the money while rooting around the room they were staying in @entity1 found the money when he and his father checked into the @entity80 and he went through his usual routine of scanning the new surroundings			1
' he 's one of those kids that likes to look for stuff , ' mr @entity1 told @entity90 at the time			2
as soon as @entity1 stumbled upon the loot , his father turned it over to two police officers who were at the hotel			1
mr @entity1 has said that he is n't concerned that he probably will not get the money			1
' we did n't have the money when we got there , so it does n't change much , ' he said			0
police captain @entity98 was disappointed that he could n't give the cash to @entity100			0
' we wish the law allowed us to give it back to him , ' he told the @entity65 .			0
