by @entity0 fears are growing that the most lethal form of the ebola virus can mutate into an airborne pathogen , making the spread of the terrifying disease more difficult to check			2
it was previously thought the untreatable virus , which causes massive internal bleeding and multiple organ failure , could only be transmitted through contact with infected blood			1
but now @entity14 researchers have carried out experiments showing how monkeys can catch the deadly disease from infected pigs without coming into direct contact			1
deadly : the ebola virus , which causes fever - like symptoms , usually followed by organ failure and unstoppable bleeding , and eventually death			1
new research shows that it could be transmitted through the air ' our findings support the hypothesis that airborne transmission may contribute to spread , specifically from pigs to primates , and may need to be considered in assessing transmission from animals to humans in general , ' they said			1
the findings come as scores of people in @entity40 were yesterday isolated to prevent the spread of a new @entity43 outbreak that has already killed three in the country			1
@entity43 cause fatal haemorrhagic fevers in humans and many other species of non-human primates			0
it was first reported in 1976 in @entity49 and is named for the river where it was recognized			0
there is no cure or vaccine for it			0
the illness is ' characterised by fever , headache , joint and muscle aches , sore throat , and weakness , followed by diarrhoea , vomiting , and stomach pain , ' according to the @entity64 - based @entity63 ' a rash , red eyes , hiccups and internal and external bleeding may be seen in some patients			1
' the virus is known to be transmitted through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person , or objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions			1
it is often spread during communal funerals where there has been an outbreak when the bereaved come into contact with an @entity43 victim			1
in some cases , it can trigger organ failure and unstoppable bleeding , killing a previously healthy adult within days			1
one of the deadliest diseases known , it has killed two - thirds of the roughly 1,850 people who have been diagnosed with it			0
experts say this extreme virulence is its weak spot			0
the virus can be contained because it kills its victims faster than it can spread to new ones			2
however , if the disease is now airborne it could make containment more difficult			0
highly contagious : a @entity105 team prepares to move eight @entity43 patients from a government isolation ward to a newly installed @entity105 ward in @entity109 during a 2007 outbreak researchers at the @entity112 in @entity113 deliberately infected six piglets with the ebola virus and put them in pens where macaque monkeys were housed in wire cages			1
within eight days all four monkeys caught the virus through indirect contact , according to the study published in the journal @entity124			1
@entity43 is thought to be introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals			1
in @entity133 , infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees , gorillas , fruit bats , monkeys , forest antelope and porcupines found dead or ill in the rainforest			0
once infected individuals return to their communities , @entity43 spreads through human - to - human transmission resulting from close contact with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people			2
health - care workers have frequently been infected and must wear gloves , masks and goggles while treating patients suffering from @entity43			0
the viral haemorrhagic fever @entity43 causes is often characterised by the sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			0
this is followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding , and eventually death			1
severe cases require intensive supportive care			0
no specific treatment or vaccine is yet available for @entity43 , although several vaccines are in development			0
dr @entity176 from the @entity177 at the @entity178 took part in the study			0
he told @entity181 that they suspect that large droplets of moisture containing the virus were being exhaled with the piglets ' breath			2
' they can stay in the air , but not long , they do n't go far , ' he told the broadcaster			0
' but they can be absorbed in the airway and this is how the infection starts , and this is what we think , because we saw a lot of evidence in the lungs of the non-human primates that the virus got in that way			2
' further work is needed but the findings are worrying as macaques are close genetic relatives to humans , said the researchers			2
fruit bats are a known ' reservoir ' for the ebola virus , and people have also contracted the disease after handling infected chimps , gorillas , gorillas , monkeys , forest antelope and porcupines			0
but this research suggests that wild or domestic pigs could also be a natural host			0
the latest outbreak of the disease in @entity40 - in a district just 40 miles from the capital @entity226 - comes roughly a month after the country declared itself @entity43 - free following an earlier outbreak in a remote district of western @entity40			1
the latest @entity43 outbreak , officials say , is of the @entity233 strain of @entity43 and not linked to the previous one , of the @entity49 variety , which killed at least 16 villagers in july and august in the western district of @entity238			2
in addition to the three dead in the latest outbreak , up to 15 are being monitored for signs of the disease , officials said			1
@entity43 is especially feared in @entity40 , where multiple outbreaks have occurred over the years , and news of it can cause patients to flee hospitals to avoid infection			1
in 2000 , in one of the world 's worst @entity43 outbreaks , the disease infected 425 @entity40 and killed more than half of them in the country 's north			2
another outbreak in 2007 killed 37 people in @entity109 , a remote district close to the @entity49 border .			0

findings come as scores of @entity40 are isolated in latest outbreak
