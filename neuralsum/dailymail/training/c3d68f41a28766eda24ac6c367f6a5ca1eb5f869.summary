an @entity1 casino is cursing its bad luck , and a careless security driver , after it lost a bag of cash worth $ 21,000			1
the incident took place during a routine pickup from @entity9 when the armoured vehicle driver left the cash on the roof of his car and drove off			1
it is the second bit of bad news in less than a week for the $ 2.4billion resort , after they announced they are having to close their doors due to money problems			1
the @entity9 in @entity1 has fallen victim to a careless security card			1
security footage shows the bag being placed on the roof of the car by the driver before he drives off onto his next pickup			1
unbelievably it is still on the roof when the car pulls up at @entity31 , which is about six minutes drive away from @entity32 , reports @entity33			2
the driver then gets back in his truck and pulls off , yet again failing to notice the cash on his roof			1
it is unclear where or when the money fell off after that			0
the @entity9 has said that responsibility for the loss lies with @entity44			2
( stock photo ) the money 's route : incredibly the money survived the six minute drive between the @entity50 and @entity9 casinos @entity44 , the armoured vehicle company involved , have opened an investigation			2
' we are cooperating with the authorities in investigating this incident and can not provide any additional details , ' said @entity57 , director of corporate communications			0
while losing $ 21,000 would be staggering for most gamblers , it 's not a lot compared to @entity9 's other losses			1
the casino , completed just two years ago for $ 2.4 billion , has failed to generate enough business to stay open and filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in june			2
it loses about $ 2 million a week , according to bankruptcy documents			0
it is not the first time an armoured car has lost the money it is supposed to be transporting			0
in may , a @entity73 man who was working in a parking lot as part of a drug rehabilitation program returned $ 125,000 that had fallen from one of the vehicles			0
in 1981 , a @entity81 man found $ 1.2 million that had fallen from an armored car			0
@entity84 , the unemployed man who found the cash , went on a spending spree , giving cash to friends and strangers alike			0
he was later acquitted of theft charges for reasons of temporary insanity .			0

cash was still on the roof when it stopped at the next pickup address
