‘ the liar - in - chief is @entity5 , and the obstruction of justice is what is going to be his biggest problem			2
i do n’t believe he was involved in the lane closures itself , but those lane closures violate federal law , ’ said state senator @entity11			1
he said @entity5 ‘ circled the wagons , had a phony story about a traffic study no one could believe			2
@entity30 and behold , the morning we found out it was a phony story , he found out			0
what he found out was that we found out			0
on sunday , former @entity41 mayor @entity40 defended the governor , but said he is putting his political future in jeopardy should evidence surface that he had any knowledge of his aides ’ alleged actions in the @entity50 scandal			1
‘ he says he did n’t know			0
i think it ’s pretty darn credible			0
he would n’t make this blanket denial unless it ’s not true , ’ @entity40 told @entity51			2
‘ if , for some reason , it ’s not true , the man has put his political career completely at risk if it turns out there is some evidence that he knew about it			2
‘ he ’s taken the complete risk that his political career is over			0
i do n’t think he ’d do that if there ’s any suggestion he knew about this			0
’ ' i believe him ' : former mayor of @entity41 , @entity40 , says @entity5 's remarks that he did n't know about the incident are ' credible ' unfortunately your browser does not support @entity72			1

‘ and the reality is , things go wrong in an administration			0
and frankly , you know , he was in campaign - mode at the time , during campaign - mode you miss a lot of things			0
you ’re not paying as much attention			0
we see that with @entity83 , ’ @entity40 said			2
‘ after the fact , it seems like how did n’t they know ? but the reality is you miss a lot of things when you ’re running a government that ’s as complicated as @entity12 , @entity41 or the @entity103 , ’ @entity40 added			1
‘ this has happened to many presidents , many governors , many mayors			0
it ’s happened to the present president at three or four times where he said i did n’t know			0
and then the press says , gosh , how could he not have known ? ’ @entity5 , pictured on thursday , denied he had any prior knowledge of the bridge plan			1
he could be impeached if found guilty @entity5 could be impeached if the team investigating the ' @entity3 ' scandal find he knew the motive behind the @entity50 closures			1

investigation : @entity120 , who is leading the bridge inquiry , says he did n't find @entity5 's denials credible ' these people travel with him , these people discuss things with him every single day			1
this is not an isolated , unknown story , ' mr @entity120 said of @entity5 's aides , who were named in the emails and text messages			1
' he knew there was an investigation			0
he knew people were looking at it , and his senior staff was involved [ and ] he expects us to believe he knew nothing ? i just find that implausible			0
' he added : ' using the @entity50 , a public resource , to exact a political vendetta , is a crime ... having people use their official position to have a political game is a crime			0
so if those tie back to the governor in any way , it clearly becomes an impeachable offense			0
' a special session is due to be held on thursday to re-authorize subpoena power for the investigative committee			1
the @entity50 links @entity171 , @entity12 with @entity41 's @entity173 borough many are at odds over whether governor @entity5 , who was tipped to run for president in 2016 , was involved governor @entity5 is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a @entity184 mayor mr @entity120 says he plans to use that power to subpoena official and private emails , text messages and other documents from current and former aides , before calling them in ' one by one ' to testify			1
