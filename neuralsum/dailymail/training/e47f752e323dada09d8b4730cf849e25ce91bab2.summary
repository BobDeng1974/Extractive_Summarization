the bully punched the 11 - year - old victim as she resisted the horrific sex attack by the 14 - year - old male in @entity14 , who was worried he would look like a ' wimp ' if he did not do it			1

in a shocking hearing yesterday it was revealed that the girl protagonist was laughing throughout the rape in october 2010			1
the boy , now 15 , admitted the attack but a judge said he was satisfied his younger co-accused , now 13 , was the instigator of the heinous crime			1
judge @entity0 said : ' i accept although you were the older you were encouraged by a younger , stronger character			2
' she was the one to suggest playing dares and had punched the girl when she resisted , he said , adding , despite their age he said there was no alternative but to impose 28 months detention			1
@entity45 , prosecuting , said the girl had been domineering and bullied the victim , although they had a form of friendship			2
on the day concerned they had ended up back at the girl defendant ’s home in her bedroom and were later joined by the youth			2
it was at that point the 12 - year - old suggested a game of dares to the other two			1
' it was a game that was to have serious consequences for the complainant , ' he said			2
shocking : the duo were sent to young offender institutions for 28 months after the hearing at @entity18 yesterday , pictured the girl suggested the boy have sex with the 11 - year - old who was punched in the face when she indicated reluctance to participate			1

their victim ran home and her mother noticed her face was red			0
she said the other girl had hit her but did not at that stage reveal her ordeal			0
it was only later she felt she had to speak out			0
@entity97 , representing the boy , now 15 , said : ' this was a very unusual and extraordinary and exceptional set of circumstances			0
' the boy was extremely immature and vulnerable to pressure from a stronger character			0
he said later he felt he could not back down on the dare because it would make him ' seem like a wimp			0
' @entity107 , for the girl , now 13 , said it was ' highly unusual offending particularly for a young female			2
' she too was immature and because of her troubled background had difficulty at the time empathising with the victim ’s situation .			0

the bully laughed throughout the sex attack as she *egged* on the 14 - year - old rapist
