childcare centres around @entity1 are sending children home with poo - filled underwear in plastic bags to the shock of parents who have labelled the practice disgusting			1
@entity10 guidelines prevent childcare centres from rinsing or washing clothing , so if a child has an accident , their pants the underwear must be bagged and labelled and left in a communal bucket for parents to take home at the end of the day			1
@entity20 , 34 , said that she was presented with her son @entity21 's underwear after being informed that the staff were not allowed to touch faecal matter			1
when your child is learning to " potty train " the childcare providers ask that you bring in a spare pair of undies and shorts ... but that was all i was told , ' ms @entity20 told @entity40			0
' the first time i was given my " goody bag " the day care mum said " oh ! before i forget ! @entity21 has a present for you			2
. " she walked to the toilet area and fished out a a grey plastic shopping bag , which was tied in a knot at the top and handed it to me			0
i could see the words " @entity55 " written on the bag and a date , ' she said			0
ms @entity20 said that she was shocked that centres would send home a ' full piece of poo '			2
' dirty underwear is one thing , but wrapping the entire thing up , for you to then put in your handbag , walk down the street to your car			0
. and drive the whole way home with a full piece in the bag			0
. that 's a bit far , ' she said			0
@entity74 , from @entity75 , took to @entity76 to express her frustration over the practice , after she had repeatedly asked her daughter 's childcare centre to throw out the soiled underwear rather than send it home			1
the final straw came when she opened a three - day old bag with her daughter 's name on it			1
ms @entity74 posted on media personality @entity89 's official @entity76 page , asking for advice on how to handle the situation			1
' today , i got greeted with a plastic bag with an entire turd wrapped in princess pink undies with ' @entity96 ' written on , ' she wrote			0
' yes my daughter is named @entity96 but surely this is n't her complete turd packaged from 3 days prior after sitting in communal ' turd ' bucket for 3 days ! ! ! surely ... can i please ask , what would have @entity89 done ? please …			2
' @entity89 brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue , and said she ' would have lost my mind			2
' ' [ i would have ] taken the unfortunate doggy bag , found that person 's car and placed the poo in a spot they would never find and just let the smell haunt them until they had to set their car on fire			0
' outraged parents were quick to comment , with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo			1
' i have had such a turd greet me , but the day care centre in question were kind enough to distribute each individual turd in their little plastic bags into the respective child 's backpack			2
revolting , & thrown straight in the bin - because what else can you do with that kind of s * * t ? ' posted one parent			0

some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice @entity74 , a mother from @entity75 , would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres can not remove the poo , they throw out the underwear childcare centres are advised by the @entity163 to ' place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative , so parents can take their child ’s clothes home ' ms @entity74 said that she has made a formal complaint with the @entity200 of @entity201 a spokesperson from the @entity203 said that education and care services are required to ' ensure adequate health and hygiene practices ' and ' have laundry facilities or access to laundry facilities ; or other arrangements for dealing with soiled clothing '			1

while the @entity163 's guidelines are not legislated , some childcare centres around @entity1 choose to accept the recommendations ' the centre said it was against their guidelines to do much more than package it up			1
i asked for them to throw the underwear out but staff changes mean that not everyone knows and that my daughter 's poo keeps being sent home			1
' ms @entity74 said that she was worried that the hot bathroom where the soiled bags are kept would negatively impact on the toilet training of the children			0
' this is a very critical time , developmentally , for young children , and the environment it meant to be pleasant			0
the room is disgusting , it smells , and this is not creating an efficient , rewarding experience			0
' ms @entity74 would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres can not remove the poo , they throw out the underwear , and said that the practice is humiliating for children			2
' it 's like a child is n't deserving of the same respect that adults get			0
imagine having to take your bag home with poo inside it , it 's degrading , ' she said			2
