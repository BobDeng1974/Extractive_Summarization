by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 11:48 est , 4 march 2014 if you 've ever wanted to recreate a cinema in your living room , or turn your bedroom into a karaoke bar , @entity2 has the answer			2
its @entity11 prototype beams screens from a computer on to the walls of a room , including browser tabs , maps , documents , videos and photos			1
the system uses small projectors and sensors to scan the layout of a room , including furniture , objects and people , to make sure the web pages are n't distorted			1

this skeleton is created using a series of sensors that scan the layout of a room , including furniture , objects and people , to make sure the web pages are n't distorted			0
it also uses a @entity67 camera to map mouse clicks to hand gestures			1
this means users can hold their hand over the position of a link on the wall and if they mimic pushing it , the @entity11 system recognises it as mouse click			2

this means users can hold their hand over the position of a link on the wall and if they mimic pushing it , the @entity11 system recognises it as mouse click			2
examples given in the research paper include videos being projected from a pc onto a large wall , karaoke lyrics displayed above a music video playing on a tv screen , or a photo of a window being used in place of a wall			1
@entity11 is similar to @entity2 's @entity102 technology it announced in january last year			1
the difference is that @entity102 used the sensors and camera to beam images from games onto the wall and immerse gamers in fantasy lands			2
at the moment , the technology is just a proof - of - concept designed and tested by @entity113 , and the firm has not announced plans to release it to the public			0
the system can also be used to beam a photo of a window onto a wall , for example , pictured			0

@entity11 also uses a @entity67 camera to map gestures			1
this means users can hold their hand over the position of a link on the wall and mimic a click by pushing their hand forward @entity2 did n't reveal exactly how the system works , but said : ' after a one - time setup procedure that scans a room for projectable surfaces in about a minute , our prototype can render immersive multi-display web rooms at greater than 30 frames per second with up to 25 screens and up to a 1440x720 display			2

any screen on a computer can be beamed onto the wall , including maps , pictured the designers also stress that the system is secure and ca n't detect faces or read documents in a room , such as bills on a table for example			0
when the firm announced the @entity102 last year , it said the system ' augments the area surrounding a television screen with projected visualisations to enhance the traditional living room entertainment experience			0
' @entity11 uses the @entity67 camera in a similar way to ' blur the lines between on - screen content and the environment we live in allowing us to combine our virtual and physical worlds			2
' the @entity67 sensor , and @entity185 software , can track force and movement in highly accurate detail			0
it can also be used in the @entity11 technology to recognise furniture and either incorporate chairs and tables directly into the browser , or mask them by adapting the video output to make the items appear invisible			0
@entity2 said : ' our system can change the appearance of the room , induce apparent motion , extend the field of view , and enable entirely new experiences			0

' the @entity67 sensor , and @entity185 software , can track force and movement in highly accurate detail ' our system uses the appearance and the geometry of the room ( captured by @entity67 ) to adapt the projected visuals in real - time without any need to custom pre-process the graphics			0
' in conclusion , the @entity229 research team added : ' our [ work ] enables the implementation of previously proposed applications and novel applications while preserving user privacy			0
' @entity11 balances privacy and functionality for immersive room experiences			0
' both @entity11 and @entity102 , pictured , are similar to technology seen in @entity241 's holodeck			2

@entity11 beams screens from a computer on to the walls of a room
this includes browser tabs , maps , documents , videos and photos
for example , videos can be projected from a pc onto a large wall
karaoke lyrics or a photo of a *picturesque* view could be shown above a tv
@entity11 is similar to @entity2 's @entity102 technology for gamers
system uses small projectors and sensors to scan the layout of a room
it also uses a @entity67 camera to map mouse clicks to hand gestures
