in the tiny @entity3 town of @entity4 , children and their parents do not give much thought to their safety at the community 's only school , because they know that some of the teachers are carrying concealed weapons			1
in the remote town , the nearest law enforcement office is 30 minutes away and the residents know each other and trust each other , so the school board made the momentous decision to allow teachers to arm themselves at their work around children			1
desperate to avoid the deadly consequences of their own school shooting incident , @entity22 has utlized armed teachers since 2007 and in the light of the @entity29 massacre became convinced it was the correct decision			1
armed and ready : at any one time , the teachers of @entity32 are carrying weapons and able to respond to a school shooter ' @entity35 was a wake up call			1
we evisioned that happening at our school , we envisioned having no protection , ' said @entity41 superintendant @entity40 to @entity42			2
' casualties mount up very quickly and the only thing as we know that has stopped any of the shooters in any of the schools has been the first responders showing up			2
' @entity3 law bans guns in schools unless the school has given written authorization			0
@entity54 and six other states have similar laws with exceptions for people who have licenses to carry concealed weapons			1
@entity4 's school board voted unanimously in 2007 to allow employees to carry weapons			1
after obtaining a state concealed - weapons permit , each employee who wants to carry a weapon must be approved by the board based on his or her personality and reaction to a crisis , @entity40 said			1
power : @entity40 is the only man who knows which of the teachers are legally allowed to carry weapons at @entity22 unaware : while it is not sure if @entity75 carries a weapons - he told @entity42 he does not know which of his staff carry guns the identities of the armed staff members are known only by the superintendent and not the students			1
' @entity83 is roughly the size of @entity85			0
that is a lot of square mileage to be covered			0
thirty minutes waiting for a first responder is an extremely long time when it comes to a school shooting , ' said @entity40			2
' we really did n't have any choice but to come up with some plan where we could be our first responder much as we are in our homes			0
' ' we know who the good people are , who the bad people are and we are going to be able to assess very quickly what 's going on			2
' if a sheriff was to come in they do n't know who the bad guys are ' teachers also must undergo training in crisis intervention and hostage situations			1
and they must use bullets that minimize the risk of ricochet , similar to those carried by air marshals on planes			0
' we focused on accuracy in our training and hostage situations , ' said @entity40			0
' after @entity119 , i have been contacted by i ca n't tell you how many school leaders , how can i do this in my community ? ' decision : the @entity35 massacre was the tipping point for the school board in @entity3 to arm their teachers ' we would rather have guns protect us than rulers and pencils			1
' the students are whole - heartedly behind the idea in interviews with the @entity136 just after @entity119 , @entity137 , who lives in the nearby community of @entity140 , said she took her children out of a larger school and enrolled them in @entity4 two years ago , partly because she felt they would be safer in a building with armed teachers			1
' i think it 's a great idea for trained teachers to carry weapons , ' @entity146 said			1
' but i hate that it has come to this			0
' the superintendent wo n't disclose how many of the school 's 50 employees carry weapons , saying that revealing that number might jeopardize school security			1
the school , about 150 miles northwest of @entity160 near the @entity162 border , has 103 students from kindergarten through 12th grade			0
most of them rarely think about who is carrying a gun			0
' this is the first time in a long time that i 've thought about it , ' said @entity173 , the principal 's 17 - year - old son			2
' and that 's because of what happened ' in @entity177			2
@entity40 said other @entity3 schools allow teachers to carry weapons , but he would not reveal their locations , saying they are afraid of negative publicity			1
the @entity183 said it had not heard of any other schools with such a policy			0
' when they decided to go with the policy there were things happening in the world , ' said principal @entity191			0
' if a gun is fired in a school , you want a person who will go to the gunfight not away from the gunfight			0
' ' i have heard the argument that teachers are n't police			2
but i would rather be able to call a parent and say your child is fine			0
that ( the opposite ) is something that i am not prepared to live with .			0

teachers in @entity22 carry concealed weapons
decision taken in 2007 after @entity35 massacre and *confirmed* after the @entity119 shooting in *december* 2012
the rural town took decision because it is too far from sheriff 's office
only one man in the *district* knows how many teachers are armed
