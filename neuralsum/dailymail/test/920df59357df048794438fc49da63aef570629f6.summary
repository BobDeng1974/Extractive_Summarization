a woman 's noisy neighbour has issued a withering reply to her hand - written letter complaining about his hard - partying ways , claiming only the deaf and ' those buried in the cemetery ' would have any concerns with the noise coming for his home			1
the man 's sarcastic response comes after @entity15 - based actor , @entity14 , wrote a two - page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night			1
@entity14 thought the good - humoured note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken again just before dawn the following sunday			1
so she followed up by dropping a thank - you card and some gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who lived there because she was ' too scared ' to knock on their door			1
but after a month of not hearing back from any of her boisterous neighbours , @entity29 posted an equally cheeky reply on his @entity34 page opening with ' my dearest @entity14 '			1
he went onto apologise for the the ' music festivals and comedy galas ' and added that the deaf man and those buried in the cemetery 4kms away , that @entity45 had referred to , awake occasionally			0
' there 's probably people out there that think your crazy for what you done but not me i thought you were brave and i respect you for it , ' he went on to say			1
he then took up @entity45 's offer of getting to know each other over a few drinks			0
' we look forward to getting to know you also and about that @entity69 you mentioned let 's do it			0
' but he saved the most hilarious comment for the end			2
â€ª ' p.s we have a room for rent if you know anyone interested			0
@entity80 i 'm deadly serious			0
' @entity14 dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours because she was too scared to knock on their door after they had been quiet for an entire week the good - humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence although a week after her first letter the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home , and again at 6.45am when their mates left , @entity14 decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly - reformed dudes , who she fears could crush her ' between their shoulder blades ' as ' they seem to be a gang ' , deserved to be rewarded			1
the note , which was posted on her blog and on the @entity108 site , began with thanking the less - noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on sunday she was grateful there was n't the ' bass guitar song ' interrupting her dreams about @entity115			1
' you probably think i 'm a bit weird and have too much spare time , and you are entirely correct			0
' the gifts included : a burnt dvd of the pilot episode of @entity123 where @entity124 breaks up a party on his namesake street by ' yelling at the flamin ' lot of them '			2
she then later reveals that the dvd is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on @entity134			0
two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her ' own old - school walkie - talkie ' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more effective communciation device			2
and in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party			2
last but certainly not least - @entity45 threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours			1
she signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence			1
one of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her ' own old - school walkie - talkie ' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party after she was woken by their voices on sunday morning , she wrote pros and cons about the incident - @entity176 is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling ' derpa " @entity45 took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics			1
she posted the letter on her blog with the precursor : ' so if you never hear from me again , i 've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours ' sound system			1
' @entity45 chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of ' funk ' in her letter that was also published on @entity108 website			2
' @entity202 , ' there are some choice swear words i would like to throw at you , but in the interest of being neighbourly , i 'm going to replace them all with the word ' funk '			0
' please turn your funking music down so i can get some funking sleep , ' the letter opened with			2
@entity14 wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways the actor / comedian used her humour in the two - page rant to get her rage across to the party - hard residents who live next door and cause her never - ending grief @entity14 even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics she then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them ' all the funking time '			1
adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for ' breakfast radio hosts , international flight passengers , and parents of infants			1
' @entity14 said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but would n't have been heard over the revving of their friend 's engine of their ' sh * thouse fancy ute			1
' ' they were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty , that i am worried that the man behind the wheel was : a ) drink driving b ) not sure how to drive @entity261 ) brain damaged @entity262 ) actually a potato			2
' she signed off with her @entity265 handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just ' head towards the loud house and turn left ' her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar ' over and funking over			2
' ' i 'm not sure if it 's you , or perhaps a friend , but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling ' derpa , derpa , derpa , derpa ' at the top of his lungs			0
is he okay ? ' she asked sarcastically			0
she expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human , brain damaged or simply a moron			0
the music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before @entity45 had to go out and begin her day			1
' everyone in my street probably feels the same			0
and the street behind us			0
and the deaf man in the next suburb			0
and anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away			0
' she also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the @entity305 was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs @entity14 said she bought this card because ' @entity309 ' was not available in a large size as the considerate neighbour , @entity14 gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with the apt songs : respect by @entity315 , ' @entity316 ' by @entity317 , ' all about the @entity318 ' by @entity319 , ' @entity320 ' by @entity321 and @entity322 ' by @entity323 ' because it 's just a funkin ' good song , really '			1
but she later revealed in the note that the @entity305 was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs			2
after suggesting to catch up over a @entity69 sometime , she asked them to ' grow up			0
' @entity14 also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time			1
the exhausted performer signed off with her @entity265 handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just ' head towards the loud house and turn left '			0
