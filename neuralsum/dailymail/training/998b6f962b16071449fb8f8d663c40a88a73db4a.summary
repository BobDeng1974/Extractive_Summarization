judge @entity42 made special guardianship orders allowing the orphans to live with their maternal aunt , uncle and cousin			1
in making the guardianship order he commended the aunt and uncle ' for the dedication that have shown to the girls			1
they have without hesitation taken on the responsibility of caring for their nieces and welcomed them into their home			0
' they have , of course , had to do this whilst addressing their own grief and sense of loss			0
