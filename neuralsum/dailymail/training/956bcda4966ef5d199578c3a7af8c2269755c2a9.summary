when the pet made another dive and brought up a pair of cufflinks , the owner called police who discovered and retrieved an astonishing hoard of missing treasure			1

they have since been painstakingly cleaned a @entity63 spokesman told @entity80 : ' we do n't know whether it 's things that they could n't sell or whether they 've panicked and had to throw everything away			0
' what we do know is the items were n't in bags and a lot of them were not designed to be in the water , so it 's unlikely someone was using it as an underwater storage tank			2

some of them are engraved			0
