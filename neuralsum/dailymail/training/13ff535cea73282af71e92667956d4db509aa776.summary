by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 21 august 2013 in a resort once wildly popular with @entity4 tourists , sun beds lie empty , restaurant tables are disturbed only by the wind and pristine beaches are eerily silent			1
this time last year the @entity9 resort of @entity10 in @entity11 was heaving with holidaymakers keen to enjoy the tail end of the summer , but fears over the escalating violence in the country are driving sun - seekers away			1
the turmoil that has wracked @entity20 has not affected the @entity9 destinations – such as @entity10 , @entity22 and @entity23 - and @entity11 military personnel have been stationed at the key holiday resort of @entity10 as the the bodies mount in @entity20			1
take your pick : holidaymakers are shunning @entity9 resorts like @entity10 because of the violence in @entity11 empty : a once - bustling restaurant is empty of customers as the military and supporters of ousted president @entity37 clash but the security presence at @entity10 ’s airport – the main point of arrival for visitors heading to the region – has done little to reassure skittish tourists			1
the escalating crisis in @entity11 - where authorities today continued their crackdown on the @entity48 and its allies by arresting two more high - profile @entity51 figures - has led to the deaths of more than 850 people - including 70 policemen and soldiers			2
the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) reports that soldiers have also been positioned at the entrance to the resort portion of @entity10 , and at the exit to the resort area of @entity23			0
routine security checks are also being performed on entry into the airport , and police are carrying out vehicle checks in and around @entity10			0
the more southerly @entity9 resort of @entity69 witnessed clashes linked to the political storm on 14 august – although in an area away from tourist resorts			1
quiet : the @entity57 is still not ruling out travel to @entity10 , but soldiers have been placed at the airport looming fears : these sun loungers should all be filled , but many lie empty the @entity57 stresses that the situation in the @entity9 holiday spots remains stable			2
' there have been no violent protests in the @entity87 resorts during recent disturbances in @entity11 , ' a statement says			2
' the resorts remain calm			0
' the @entity57 is also maintaining its stance that @entity4 holidaymakers are safe to travel to the @entity9 areas , even though other nations have altered their advice to citizens			1
@entity96 has joined a growing band of concerned countries in warning against travel to the @entity9 resorts – joining the @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 in urging caution			2
the @entity57 ’s stance leaves @entity4 holidaymakers and travel agents in limbo			2
@entity48 leaders warned of further protests as security forces clamped down worried tourists who decide to cancel their trip can not claim a refund from their operator because the government has not ruled against ' all but essential travel ' to the @entity9			1
equally , tour operators are concerned , because bookings have dropped significantly since the current crisis in the country – sparked by the removal of president @entity37 and his replacement by an interim military government on 3 july – began			0
' let ’s face it , nobody wants to book a holiday and then have it cancelled at the last minute due to possible danger , because it then means that you ’ve got a problem trying to find something to substitute , and , of course it ’s likely to be rather more expensive , ' @entity126 – the owner of @entity127 in @entity128 – has told @entity140			0
' it is better for us as a travel agency to recommend somewhere other than @entity11 until things start quietening down a bit			0
' unstable : @entity11 has been wracked by demonstrations and violence since @entity37 was deposed adventure travel specialist explore has gone further , cancelling all tours to @entity11 for the rest of 2013			1
the company has little choice – many of its itineraries focus on the history and culture of the country , and with the @entity57 currently advising against all but essential travel to most of @entity11 , explore has been left in a difficult position			1
' the vast majority of clients were happy we have made the decision in good time for them to rearrange , ” operations director @entity161 told @entity168			0
' clients want some certainty – which is one of the reasons that we need to make the decision about cancellation about three months in advance			0
' cancelling until the end of december is a clean psychological break – it gets rid of @entity178 and the @entity179			0
i ’m very happy with the decision we ’ve made			0
