@entity50 , whose daughter was one of those given a detention , said : ‘ it was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics , mathematics and cosmology			0
' to punish them does little more than alienate them			0
’ the school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye			2
principal @entity72 said : ‘ it was a question of safety			0
at the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection			0
