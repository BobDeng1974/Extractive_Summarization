@entity0 and @entity2 ’s burgeoning rivalry has all the ingredients to propel athletics into the spotlight in a similar manner to the @entity7 and @entity9 clashes which captivated sports fans in the 1980s			1
‘ they could have a rivalry like @entity9 and i had , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ head - to - heads are what get people excited			2
my kids got up at the weekend to watch @entity17 and @entity18			0
the more opportunities we have for athletes going head - to - head , the better			2
it ’s what people talk about			0
‘ it ’s actually not just the thought of @entity27 and @entity28 but you have @entity30 , too , coming through and i ’m sure she will be equally good			2
it ’s an extraordinary period to be entering			0
’ @entity0 won the @entity32 's in @entity33 , @entity34 to become world no 1 @entity2 is the @entity36 and her future rivalry with @entity0 is ' exciting ' @entity0 , 22 , is the @entity40 ’s @entity39 hept - athlete and broke @entity43 ’s @entity42 record at the @entity44 in @entity33 this month			1
her blistering form — coupled with murmurs from the @entity47 that her training for a comeback after the birth of son @entity52 is going very well — has set the scene for a mouthwatering duel			2
the pair are understandably keen to play down talk of a rivalry , @entity0 out of reverence for the @entity36 champion of whom she claims to be ‘ in awe ’ and @entity43 because she is unsure what competitive shape she will be in			1
but those charged with promoting the sport are keen to make the most of the fact that @entity42 boasts the world ’s two leading multi-eventers			0
they were expected to compete against each other for the first time since @entity72 — when @entity0 was 15th — at the @entity73 at the end of may , when the world ’s leading heptathletes descend on the @entity78 alpine town @entity79			1
but @entity80 revealed to @entity81 that he is trying to set up a head - to - head for earlier that month at the @entity83 in @entity84			2
lord @entity7 wants the heptathletes to have an exciting duel like he did with @entity9 in the 1980s ‘ @entity28 has already agreed to do the 200 metres hurdles and long jump , ’ said @entity80			1
‘ @entity27 was invited to take part in the same events and soundings are favourable from her			0
‘ with heptathlon they might only battle it out twice a year but if sport in @entity42 is to benefit from the rivalry that is going to be inevitable between these two then they should compete against each other a couple more times head - to - head in one , two or three events			1
it ’s in their interests and very much in the sport ’s interest			0
’ both @entity0 and @entity43 , 29 , have the @entity106 in @entity107 this summer as their primary aim and will probably be joined by 17 - year - old @entity30 , who has surpassed anything either of them achieved at the same age			1
@entity0 and @entity43 are friends off the track despite the well speculated competition @entity7 and @entity9 were great rivals in the 80s and provided huge entertainment for the athletics world with 12 years spanning their ages the three are unlikely ever to stand on the podium together but @entity7 thinks that they can transform the image of a sport that increasingly seems to command the spotlight only when a new doping scandal emerges			1
‘ those three can really help engage , particularly with young girls where the challenge is to get them involved in sport , ’ he said			0
‘ stars like @entity28 and @entity27 are important for the sport			0
they are from normal backgrounds , they have n’t come out of some kind of super-schools , they are like the kids next door and that is really important so that people can identify with them			0
’ the @entity140 takes place on sunday , july 19 and gives you the chance to run on the track and cross the finish line in the @entity146			0
to take part , visit @entity148			0
17 - year - old @entity30 is highly regarded and could add serious competition to the title in the future			1

@entity2 and @entity0 could become an ' exciting ' rivalry like lord @entity7 and @entity9 's in the 1980s
the heptathletes look set to compete during the *outdoor* *season*
@entity0 is the @entity158 1 but @entity43 is @entity36 champion
17 - year - old @entity30 is also a hot prospect for the event
