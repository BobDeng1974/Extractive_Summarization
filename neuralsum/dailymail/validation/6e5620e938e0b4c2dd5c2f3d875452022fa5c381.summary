in a season when @entity3 ’s aspirations have been peeled away like layers of an onion , the only goal left is qualification for the @entity7			1
it is enough to make even the steadfast shed a tear			0
thrashed in the @entity11 by @entity13 @entity12 and dumped out of the @entity14 by one of their own , @entity3 were never even in the @entity18 title race			1
entry back into @entity20 ’s elite competition would represent a positive campaign however			2
the minimal requirement , undoubtedly , but a mark of improvement nonetheless			0
something to look forward to			0
@entity3 have not beaten a team in the top half of the @entity18 since @entity27 in december failure to finish in the top four would be pretty disastrous though			1
without the extra commitment of a @entity32 campaign and having held a healthy lead in this run at one stage , falling late would ask serious questions of @entity37			1
it would probably mean entry into the @entity40 instead – a nightmare scenario adding games in a competition @entity3 would rather avoid entirely			1
@entity3 face a difficult run - in , with 10 games to define their season			1
four of their next five matches are against the top six but @entity52 ’s side have not beaten a team currently in the top half of the table since december			1
here , @entity56 assesses their chances			0
@entity3 vs @entity58 ( march 15 ) reverse fixture : 0 - 0 a struggle for life , is how @entity52 termed the second half of the sides ’ dour draw at @entity65 on december 28			1
a repeat would be intolerable not only to watching fans but in the table			0
@entity3 must win , and beware @entity69			2
the 21 - year - old striker already has 26 goals to his name this season - more than the supposedly stellar line - up of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 have managed for @entity3 combined			1
besides , @entity78 's men have @entity7 ambitions of their own , and will be desperate for a victory over one of their chief rivals for the top four			2
prediction : 2 - 1 @entity3 @entity3 train ahead of their crunch @entity18 clash against @entity58 on sunday @entity74 , @entity88 and @entity76 are all smiles despite their side 's recent struggles football data analysts @entity92 believe a @entity3 home win is easily the most likely outcome march 15 : @entity58 ( home ) march 22 : @entity27 ( away ) april 4 : @entity97 ( home ) april 12 : @entity99 ( home ) april 18 : @entity101 ( away ) april 26 : @entity102 ( away ) may 2 : @entity103 ( home ) may 9 : @entity105 ( away ) may 16 : @entity106 ( home ) may 24 : @entity108 ( away ) @entity27 vs @entity3 ( march 22 ) reverse fixture : 3 - 0 @entity3 the match at @entity112 sparked @entity27 ’s remarkable resurgence into the @entity7 hunt			1
this game could prove the deciding factor			0
@entity117 has his side buoyant and @entity119 will be bouncing			2
@entity52 should douse the flames with his selection			0
but , with @entity125 rampant , @entity123 offering pace and dynamism simply not seen in @entity3 's team and @entity128 now back in action after injury , the @entity127 will need a tactical masterstroke to pull off victory			1
this is arguably the fiercest rivalry in the land as @entity136 's two most successful clubs go head - to - head			2
@entity119 will be rocking with the added incentive that @entity52 's head could be on the block if he fails to finish in the top four			1
prediction : 1 - 1 @entity3 vs @entity97 ( april 4 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 1 @entity144 led @entity58 to victory in his previous visit to @entity112 as a manager , and @entity97 are showing signs of vibrancy under his charge			1
they need points for survival and will fight all the way for it			0
surely @entity3 will have too much quality though			2
could arguably be the easiest fixture in @entity3 's run - in			1
but , as we 've seen these last two seasons , anything is possible in the @entity163 era			0
prediction : 2 - 0 @entity3 @entity3 vs @entity99 ( april 12 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 0 city @entity168 got the decisive goal at the @entity170 on an afternoon @entity171 lost his head and @entity99 were denied three clear penalties			1
@entity175 ’s team have not often been at their best since , but their firepower can be awesome when focused on the right target			0
such as their biggest rivals			0
this will be a third @entity182 derby at @entity112 at this stage in three consecutive seasons			0
@entity99 have won the past two			0
6 - 1 , anyone ? @entity3 have rarely got near their noisy neighbours in recent years			1
and @entity99 's focus could be entirely focused on overhauling @entity101 's @entity18 lead after their likely @entity7 elimination in @entity190			1
but @entity112 will not stand for their men surrendering as meekly as during last season 's grim 3 - 0 defeat			1
prediction : 1 - 1 @entity168 is likely to cause the @entity3 defence problems in next month 's @entity196 @entity101 vs @entity3 ( april 18 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 1 @entity75 ’s late equalising goal got @entity112 to its feet and hoping a turning point had been found			1
it proved to be a false dawn and @entity101 have eased away at the top			2
out of @entity20 , @entity206 ’s side are unlikely to lose focus as their hunt for the title reaches its closing moments			0
men like @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 will surely not let that happen , and the @entity218 ' mixture of power , pace and potency should see them too good for @entity3			2
@entity222 did , however , expose chinks in @entity101 's armour			0
whether @entity225 , @entity226 et al are strong enough to pierce those gaps is another matter , prediction 2 - 1 @entity101 @entity230 has been @entity101 's stand out player this season as they bid to recapture the title @entity102 vs @entity3 ( april 26 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 1 @entity3 @entity76 appeared like a tiger to pounce for the winning goal at @entity112 but the once - feared predator has experienced the wilderness since			1
defeat at @entity240 did for @entity241 last season although the ground does hold happier memories for @entity3			1
but @entity102 are in a scrap themselves			0
defeat this weekend and a victory for @entity248 or @entity249 could leave @entity251 's men just three points off the dreaded drop zone			0
surely that would be the wake - up call @entity102 need to spark their season into life at long last			2
prediction : 1 - 1 @entity259 could cause @entity3 problems if he can carry his @entity32 form into the @entity18 @entity3 vs @entity103 ( may 2 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 2 @entity263 came from behind to salvage a point at the @entity265 , with @entity267 ’s measured effort the point - clincher			1
@entity103 are a tougher nut to crack these days under @entity270 but the need for victory will weigh heavy on the hosts			0
the @entity103 were also one of the teams to spring a shock at @entity112 last season , when @entity278 and @entity279 stunned @entity241			0
expect @entity278 to score at @entity112 again , but @entity3 to have the edge with more to play for than their visitors			2
prediction : 2 - 1 @entity3 @entity270 has transformed @entity103 's fortunes and his side will be a stern test for @entity3 in may @entity105 vs @entity3 ( may 9 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 0 @entity3 @entity88 , remember him ? the @entity289 popped up for the winner in the season ’s earlier game , an example of @entity3 at their most stubborn - performing poorly but still grinding out a win			1
another illustration at @entity296 would do just fine			0
but that is easier said than done , with @entity298 having galvanised @entity105 since his return to @entity296			0
silencing the @entity105 ' ferocious home support in a big game towards the end of the season is no easy task - just ask @entity27			2
but surely @entity52 can squeeze a win here			0
prediction : 1 - 0 @entity3 @entity88 scored the only goal of the game when @entity3 hosted @entity105 earlier in the season @entity3 vs @entity106 ( may 16 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 1 @entity3 a smash and grab to make @entity314 blush , @entity3 stole three points from the @entity316 in a game they ought to have lost			1
@entity225 and @entity74 showed a fleeting impression of understanding too			0
@entity106 have since shown that they know how to win at @entity112 , thanks to the @entity322 - inspired win in the @entity14 on monday in which @entity3 struggled to get break down their opponents and were outfought as well as out - thought			1
but monday 's @entity14 defeat has pained @entity3			2
that @entity322 was the man to deliver the knockout blow stings even more			0
prediction : 2 - 1 @entity3 @entity322 scored the winner as @entity106 dumped @entity3 out of the @entity14 earlier this week @entity329 ( may 24 ) reverse fixture : 3 - 0 @entity3 the last time @entity3 visited the @entity331 on the final day sir @entity332 fielded an inexperienced side having wrapped up the title and with a @entity7 final against @entity190 on the horizon			1
@entity339 ’s side could be safe by then and less motivated			0
but if they 're not , this fixture becomes loaded full of danger - for both sides			0
you would back the @entity3 of old to win this encounter every time , but can you say the same about @entity52 's version ? prediction : 1 - 0 @entity3 @entity347 predicted points : 74			1
@entity3 won the title with just one point more in 1996/97 but the parameters have shifted since then			2
last year under @entity352 they finished seventh on 64 points , while @entity106 came fourth on 79			0
close call on whether 74 would be enough this time .			0

@entity3 's only remaining goal is to finish in the top four
the club have been *absent* from @entity32 competition this season
but @entity37 's side face four of the top six in their next five games
@entity3 have not beaten a top - half @entity18 side since december
