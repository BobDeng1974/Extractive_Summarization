a 17 - year - old girl who was forced to undergo chemotherapy testified monday at a closed door hearing where she and her mother are seeking her release from state custody			1
@entity6 testified by teleconference in @entity8 , according to attorneys			1
the teen learned recently that her cancer is in remission and she is no longer fighting the treatment			1
but she and her mother are asking to end her custody by the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) so she can go home now instead of waiting until the chemotherapy is complete next month			1
@entity6 was ordered by the @entity18 to undergo cancer treatment ms @entity6 , left , said the hospital tried to prevent her mother , @entity21 , right , from visiting her room mrs @entity6 , pictured , said she was behind her daguter 's decision to not undergo cancer treatment			1
@entity26 , an attorney for the teen 's mother , @entity27 , said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order , they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital			1
ms @entity34 said @entity15 has prohibited her from having contact with her mother			1
' we 'd like to end the whole thing , ' @entity26 said , according to the @entity38 , during a break in the hearing , ' but if we ca n't , we want to do as much as we can for her			2
she wants to be with her mother			2
' ms @entity6 remains confined at @entity42 in @entity43			1
she will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in september			2
after ms @entity6 was diagnosed with high - risk @entity47 lymphoma in september , she and her mother missed several appointments , prompting doctors to notify the @entity15 , court documents say			1
@entity47 ( cells pictured ) is a disease of the white blood cells @entity47 is cancer of the white blood cells called b lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			2
the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			2
@entity64 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			2
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			0
the most common symptom of @entity47 is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			0
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			0
the cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system , taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the @entity96 ( which causes glandular fever )			0
it is n't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it			0
the only way to confirm a diagnosis of @entity47 is by carrying out a biopsy			0
almost all young people with @entity47 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids			1
a trial court in november granted @entity15 temporary custody of ms @entity6			1
lawyers for @entity6 and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed			1
the case went to the state @entity18 , which ruled in january that the state was n't violating ms @entity6 's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy			1
the case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states — whether 16 - and 17 - year - olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions			2
ms @entity6 told @entity133 that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit			1
she said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape			2
on the day before her chemotherapy , hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic			1
she said : ' when a nurse came in and i told myself just to fight			0
when she started to put an iv in me , i would n’t let her			0
' ms @entity6 spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment			1
' @entity150 had to pick me up , pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles , when i woke up , i looked down and there was a port in my chest			0
i thought , ' i can not believe they did this to me			0
' ' i felt violated			0
i felt like i was being treated like an animal			2
i thought , " how can you force a person , regardless of how old they are , to do something they have n’t given consent to ? ' " ' in a statement to @entity168 , @entity166 's @entity15 said : ' when experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent , then the @entity15 has a responsibility to take action			0
even if the decision might result in criticism , we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required			0
' much of the improvements in @entity166 's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges			0
' unfortunately that ca n't happen in every situation , especially when the life of a child is at stake			0
' ms @entity6 received three weeks ' chemotherapy at @entity42 ( pictured )			1

@entity6 , 17 , wanted to *decline* chemotherapy for her cancer
@entity18 ruled that ms @entity6 must undergo treatment
the teenager *complained* that she had been ' treated like an animal '
she said the hospital *refused* to allow her mother to visit her
