after @entity2 shot his ex-girlfriend and posted an online death threat against police , investigators in @entity1 used modern cellphone tracking technology to follow his journey to @entity8 in real time			1
but when it came to giving the @entity13 specifics about @entity2 , the means were markedly low - tech : a phone call and a wanted flier sent by fax. that warning flier came too late , sent a mere two minutes before @entity2 walked up to a patrol car and shot officers @entity21 and @entity22 dead without warning			1
the official timeline in the @entity2 episode emerged this week , as @entity8 police commissioner @entity26 said tuesday that @entity2 was carrying hundreds of dollars at the time of the slayings			1
the transmissions , or ' pings , ' showed he was traveling northbound on a bus on @entity48 that arrived in @entity49 at 10:49am			0
he then took the subway to @entity51 , where he used the stolen phone to make posts to @entity54			1
one showed his bloodied green shoe			0
the other showed his pistol			0
' i 'm putting wings on pigs today they take 1 of ours ... ... let 's take 2 of @entity65 ( hash ) @entity66 , ' he wrote			0
at 12:07pm , @entity2 ditched the phone near the @entity70 arena and disappeared			2
@entity38 police say they became aware of the @entity54 postings at about 1:30pm			1
they first tried calling a precinct in @entity73 but were told to call the precinct in the @entity76 neighborhood , and had a conversation with police there around 2:10pm			1
police say the flier with @entity2 's photo was then faxed , at the @entity13 's request , to a @entity51 command at 2:46pm			1
it warned that he was in @entity51 , armed with a semi-automatic handgun and was saying online that ' he will shoot a police officer today			1
' two minutes later , @entity2 opened fire			1
moments later , he committed suicide - likely around the same time the @entity88 was sent to @entity13 headquarters in @entity49			2
police on both ends say they took immediate and proper measures to try to alert officers about an armed and dangerous fugitive bent on violence against law enforcement			2
but the seemingly antiquated way they did it has raised questions about the potential for communication lapses to hamper urgent manhunts			0
though refusing to fault how the warning was handled , commissioner @entity26 has called it ' an irony ' the ambush occurred a time when the @entity13 has launched a $ 160 million program to equip each member of the 35,000 - officer force with a department - issued computer tablet or smartphone to improve information - sharing			1
victims : officers @entity21 , left , and @entity22 , right , were slain on saturday by @entity2 remembered : candles and other items left by visitors make up a growing makeshift memorial on tuesday near the site where @entity21 and @entity22 were murdered in @entity51 @entity2 killed himself likely around the same time the @entity88 was sent to @entity13 headquarters in @entity49 currently , police departments in @entity8 , @entity125 , @entity126 and elsewhere mostly rely on dispatchers to make radio transmissions giving descriptions of suspects or fliers - copied and faxed - with mug shots passed out at roll calls			1
smaller forces have gone to blasting notifications to department - issued smartphones , but most larger ones say to do the same would be too expensive			0
with the new system , if the nation 's largest police department were to receive a mug shot of a suspect , ' we could instantly send that picture and information to every cop on their post no matter where they were , ' @entity26 said this week			1
in the case of @entity2 , it 's impossible to know whether an earlier warning would have made a difference			1
even if that information had been received earlier , all an officer sitting in a radio car would have received , @entity26 said , ' was an alert on the description of a black male , mid- 20s , that basically is making threats against police officers			1
' chief @entity162 , head of @entity13 detectives , insisted at the same news conference , ' all things were done exactly the way they were supposed to do			2
... there was no lapse on anybody 's part			0
' a @entity172 spokeswoman also said they ' followed our standard operating procedures			0
' still , @entity13 officials conceded that there also room for improvement in how police departments share information with each other - a lesson learned during the 10 - day rampage across @entity185 by former police officer @entity186 in february 2013			2
loss : @entity8 mayor @entity187 and his wife , @entity188 , visit the makeshift memorial on tuesday in @entity51 grief : @entity13 officers and others stand for a moment of silence at approximately 2:47 p.m on tuesday			1
@entity2 killed the two police officers at 2:48pm on saturday a report by the @entity198 - based @entity197 found communication and coordination problems between at least a half - dozen regional law enforcement agencies impeded efforts to stop @entity186			1
the nonprofit 's report , for example , found that @entity207 police officers were unaware @entity186 had just opened fire on two @entity210 officers in the neighboring city of @entity212 just minutes before they themselves were ambushed at a red light			1
the information was not relayed for 10 minutes , and the @entity210 officers were relying on private cellphones to communicate because they were too far out of range for their police radio system to work , according to the report			2
currently , if two agencies are in the same proximity , they frequently have the ability to communicate over an intercom system that connects dispatch centers , said @entity225 , president of the @entity197			0
agencies that are farther apart or across state lines typically communicate via phone , email and fax , depending on the urgency of the situation			0
' if it 's a critical incident , it all starts with a phone call , ' @entity225 said			2
' you just pick up the phone and you call someone			0
' the @entity197 report called for regional agencies to immediately upgrade their communication systems so officers in different departments can talk to one another			0
on tuesday , @entity26 said police continue to look into @entity2 had so much money on his person			2
speaking on ' @entity247 , ' @entity26 said of the investigation into @entity249 ' where did he get his money ? who does he hang out with ? [ @entity2 ] does n't seem to have been employed			2
' he 's a couch crasher , as they call it			0
he does n't seem to have a residence , he just crashes on somebody ’s couch			0
' but he seems to have had money - cash in $ 100 bills			0
so we ’re checking very closely all of his relationships			0
what was his world like ? we 're very adept at that			0
we have some of the best detectives in the world			0
