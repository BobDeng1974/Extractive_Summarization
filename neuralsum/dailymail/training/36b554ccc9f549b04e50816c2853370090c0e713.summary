by @entity0 and @entity1 a further eight people were yesterday confirmed to be suffering from @entity4 ’s disease as the deadly outbreak continued to take its toll			1
it means 36 people have now been struck down by the bug – which has already caused the death of one man – with a further 44 in @entity12 waiting for test results confirming whether they are also infected with the waterborne virus			1
of the 80 confirmed and suspected cases , 15 are in intensive care and 27 are in general wards			0
a further 16 cases are being treated in the community and a number of people have already been discharged from hospital			0
they blame cutbacks on health inspectors , coupled with recession - hit companies neglecting safety measures , for creating the ideal conditions for potentially lethal bacteria to thrive			1
one leading @entity4 ’s expert claimed firms were deliberately falsifying safety logs and said the practice could have devastating consequences			1
public health consultant @entity44 said outbreak prevention measures had slipped to dangerous levels and were not policed as rigorously as they should be			1
he said : ‘ local environmental health officers have been cut back , which means we may see more outbreaks of @entity4 ’s			1
when times are tight , maintenance is one of the first things to be cut			0
this goes right across the board – at hospitals , hotels and any facility which has water systems , air - conditioning or cooling towers			1
‘ businesses are ticking boxes and saying they are doing all these checks , but in reality not all of them are			0
they are gambling with peoples ’ lives			0
’ the source of the @entity12 outbreak has yet to be identified but health authorities believe the bacteria found its way into one of 16 cooling towers in the south - west of the city			1
the towers , thought to be responsible for the worst outbreak of its kind for 30 years , have all now been chemically treated			1
the first case of the disease was discovered last tuesday			0
the victims range in age from 33 to 76 , with men more affected than women			0
the only link between them is an association with south - west @entity12			1
last night , a @entity94 spokesman said : ‘ we have maintained the broad number of inspectors and other staff over the past five years			0
it is wrong to claim numbers have been significantly reduced			0
’ yesterday , @entity102 health secretary @entity101 said : ‘ the risk to the public remains low			1
i want to stress this bacteria is not passed on person to person or by drinking water			1
’ a whisky distillery last night found itself at the centre of the @entity112 ’ disease outbreak after failing safety checks on a cooling tower			1
the @entity115 was yesterday served with an improvement notice by the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			0
the watchdog found the firm ’s tower had not been properly treated with chemicals to kill bacteria , including legionella			1
deadly : a conceptual image of @entity125 bacteria , which causes @entity112 @entity102 's health secretary said the number of cases could still rise , despite a chemical clean - up of the industrial site thought to be responsible			1
an @entity94 statement said the improvement notice does not mean the tower concerned is where the outbreak originated			0
the firm has already taken all three of its cooling towers at the site out of operation			0
@entity102 health secretary @entity101 has said it is ' not always possible to conclusively determine the precise source of an outbreak '			1
the dead man has been named locally as @entity144 , 56 , from the @entity146 area of @entity12 , who had reportedly been working as a labourer on a building site in @entity150 before becoming unwell			1
another 14 patients are critically ill in intensive care following the outbreak , with 28 cases confirmed and 46 suspected			0
ten people have now been discharged from hospital			0
it can take up to two weeks for people to show symptoms after being infected with the disease			1
the potentially fatal infection could spread up to 44 square miles from the source , affecting tens of thousands of people			1
two patients are being treated outside of the @entity166 area - in the @entity167 and in the @entity168			1
ms @entity101 said : ' i want to stress that , although these patients are being treated elsewhere , they are considered part of the south - west @entity12 outbreak			2
they have had association with the affected area			0
outbreak : a man in his 50s has died and 15 people are in a critical condition after an outbreak of @entity112 ' at the @entity183 ' i would hope that over the next few days those investigations will start to deliver more specific answers on where the source of the outbreak might be			1
' @entity112 ’ is a potentially fatal lung infection caused by the @entity125 bacteria			0
it is caught by breathing in contaminated water droplets and can not be spread from person to person			1
@entity102 health authorities believe the bacteria may have found their way into one of several cooling towers in the south - west of @entity12			1
the tower then emitted a cloud of vapour with the bacteria in the tiny water droplets			1
the outbreak is believed to be the worst of its kind to hit @entity102 for 30 years			0
most of the victims diagnosed so far are men aged from their mid-thirties to mid-eighties , mainly living in the @entity214 , @entity150 and @entity215 areas in the south - west of the city			2
all those affected are men and women aged between 33 and 74			0
a spokesman from the @entity115 in @entity12 said : ' our thoughts are clearly with the families of those affected by this situation			0
' the @entity115 is actively working with the relevant authorities on the matter and supporting their ongoing inquiries to ascertain the source of the @entity125 bacteria			2
a map showing the location of the @entity112 ' disease outbreak ' industrial cooling towers are only one potential source of infection , and the @entity115 is one of a number of sites in the area with industrial cooling towers			2
' the site has been inspected and nothing of concern was found			0
however , we are awaiting the results of the analysis of the samples taken by @entity249			0
' we wish to reassure the local community that we will comply fully with any guidance issued by the relevant agencies			0
' ms @entity101 said 16 cooling towers identified as possible sources of the outbreak were chemically treated last week and a fresh round of chemical treatment is under way in the capital			0
she said : ‘ no link has been identified between these patients other than a general association with the affected area in the south - west of @entity12			2
' what that does is underline the view that the source of this infection is an outdoor community source and not an indoor - specific source , such as … a spa in a hotel			1
dr @entity273 , chairman of @entity166 ’s incident management team said : ' we ’re doing everything we can in terms of early diagnosis , appropriate treatment and intensive care , but i think we ca n’t rule out any further deaths at this stage			2
' @entity112 ’ is three times more common in men than women and mostly affects the over 50s			0
the elderly , smokers , and those with cancer , diabetes and kidney disease are also at higher risk			2
legionnaires ' disease is a potentially fatal lung infection caused by the bacteria legionella			0
the bacteria is commonly found in any freshwater areas but can sometimes find its way into artificial water supply systems			2
it is contracted when small droplets of contaminated water in the air are breathed in , but is not spread from person to person			1
the elderly , smokers , diabetes sufferers , those with kidney disease and cancer patients are most at risk , and men are three times more likely to contract the disease than women			2
symptoms of the disease include headaches , muscle pain , high fever , chills , a persistent cough , shortness of breath , chest pains and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea			1
about half of those who contract the disease experience changes to their mental state , such as confusion			0
symptoms can start between two and 14 days after exposure			2
the disease is treated by intravenous antibiotics			0
around 10 % of people victims will die from arising complications			0
large buildings such as hotels , hospitals and museums are more vulnerable to contamination because they have larger , more complex water supply systems , which can let the contamination spread quickly			1
initial symptoms include muscle pain , a fever , a persistent cough , chest pains and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea			1
although it can be treated by antibiotics , about one in ten patients will die			0
once it has infected your lungs , @entity112 ' causes a persistent cough and the coughing up of mucus or possibly blood followed by chest pains , and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea			1
around half of those with the disease risk changes to their mental state , and may find themselves confused			2
it is so called because it was identified at a hotel hosting a convention of the @entity371 veterans organisation in @entity372 in 1976			0
' i would like to express my sincere condolences to the family of the patient who died , ' said dr @entity377			2
' i would urge anyone who develops symptoms of @entity112 ' disease to contact @entity166 24 or their gp			2
' people who fall into certain risk groups , these are males who are adults , who have an alcohol , drinking habit and have an underlying illness such as diabetes , or heart disease or lung disease - these people are at greater risk			1
' these people should be very much aware that if they start feeling symptoms of flu - like illness , together with diarrhoea , cough and confusion , they should be consulting their gp or @entity166 24 as soon as possible			1
' the first case was identified on monday may 28 , and since then the numbers have soared			0
dr @entity377 said there was no threat to the city 's public water supply			2
' the public water supply in @entity12 is extremely closely monitored and in addition it 's not possible to contract legionnaires ' disease through drinking water			2
' it 's contracted through the inhalation of water vapour in the form of an aerosol and that does n't and that does n't happen through drinking water supplies			2
