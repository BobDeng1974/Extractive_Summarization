first things first : the selection of @entity2 on the wing is an excellent call by @entity5			1
he ’s been playing centre for @entity8 and will bring a great deal of footballing nous into @entity12 ’s back line			1
to have three players in your back three who can play in any position is a massive advantage and @entity12 are getting stronger with every game			1
an in - form @entity2 strengthens this team and @entity21 coach @entity20 would not have liked this change , which is great news ! @entity23 would have been targeted in this game and @entity2 ’s positional play and greater defensive awareness should stand @entity12 in good stead against @entity21 ’s outstanding kicking game			1
it ’s a good , positive selection			0
but this game will not be won and lost out wide on the wing or between the no 10s — @entity33 and @entity34 — as many are saying			2
it will be won by the forwards			2
@entity38 ( centre ) and @entity40 ( left ) will be key men for @entity12 in @entity42 on sunday @entity12 's forwards will be key to securing victory against @entity21 in @entity42 on sunday in the @entity45 the clash will not be won and lost out wide on the wing or between the @entity49 , the pack will decide the game @entity5 will have looked to his pack first and foremost - they are an under - rated group when you get to the crunch games like this , any international coach will look to his pack first and foremost			1
you start by writing down the names of players no 1 – 8			0
much has been written about the @entity12 backs in this @entity45 but they can only play the way they have because of the performance of an under - rated @entity12 pack			1
they are not household names but they have every chance of becoming so			0
what does it mean when people talk about winning the forward battle ? how can one pack put pressure on another ? pressure can be created in many ways but the most important is the speed and intensity with which you operate			1
i hope @entity5 has spent the week eyeballing his forwards			1
here are six indicators to see who is winning the forward battle			0
@entity5 has made an excellent call by picking in - form wing @entity2 in his side for the @entity42 clash @entity34 will hope that @entity12 's forwards can help him to an easier ride against the @entity87 on sunday the scrum the nearer you get to @entity91 , and the more important the games become , the more important the scrum becomes			1
if you do n’t get it right you will lose			0
that is still the achilles heel of @entity96 and @entity97 , who are both in our @entity100 group of death , and it will be a massive factor in this game			0
in @entity12 ’s first game against @entity97 they conceded a try from the first scrum			2
yet when you looked at it objectively , @entity12 smashed them in that scrum			2
it was a massive moment because , while @entity12 conceded , they gained a huge psychological advantage , continued to dominate that area and went on to win the game			2
@entity117 is key to disrupting @entity21 's scrum , and needs to be all over @entity119 at the base @entity12 did not start well on the scoreboard but in the most important part of the game , they started brilliantly			1
@entity12 must look to disrupt at least a third of @entity21 ’s scrums and try to win 100 per cent on their own put - in			1
by ‘ disrupt ’ i mean the opposition scrum - half finds it difficult to get the ball away from the base cleanly			0
i want to see @entity117 all over @entity119 at the base of the scrum			0
@entity12 have a better front row and a better all - round pack of forwards , and they can gain the upper hand there			1
a dominant scrum will not allow the opposition to play how they want to			0
@entity117 will be an important part of @entity12 's efforts to disrupt at least a third of the opposition 's scrums the line - out @entity12 must be looking to win at least 90 per cent of their own throw while disrupting 25 per cent of @entity21 ’s ball			1
they must play with variety in the line - out , not just in terms of numbers but in terms of where they throw the ball , to get @entity21 thinking			1
they need to be doing the unexpected and executing everything faster than the @entity157 team are accustomed to			0
something we used to do - and if you watch the 2003 @entity164 game vs @entity21 you ’ll see this - was delay kicking a penalty to touch until everybody knew the line - out call rather than making that call when everyone is assembled at the line - out			1
it meant that once the ball was in touch , everyone went quickly to the line - out			0
winning at least 90 per cent of their own throw is important and @entity12 must show variety at line - outs ideally , the @entity12 support staff will be ready with a second ball			1
do not assume the ballboys will give you a ball quickly because they will have been told to slow everything down ( we did the same by the way ! ) the hooker gets there as quick as he can and readies himself			0
the ball is thrown in immediately and you ’re already playing quicker than the opposition can react			0
get the @entity157 out of their comfort zone			0
they will want it slow but a champion team wants it fast			0
as hooker , @entity202 will have to get to the line - outs as quickly as possible to throw in immediately the restarts i recently reread my notes from before the 2003 game and one of the things we highlighted was the restarts			0
we identified two guys , @entity214 and @entity215 , who were outstandingly athletic and good in the air			0
every restart should be taken with the aim of winning the ball back , and with a kicker like @entity221 we would look left , right or straight down the middle and use the accuracy of his kicks to give those great athletes a chance of reclaiming the ball			0
we want the ball so why just kick long ? @entity12 need to avoid kicking to @entity229 from restarts because he is so strong receiving			2
instead , they must look for @entity21 ’s weakest receivers			2
@entity214 ( centre ) and @entity215 ( left ) were identified as options to reclaim the ball from restarts in the 2003 clash with @entity21 due to the fact they were outstandingly athletic and good in the air @entity12 need to avoid kicking to @entity229 ( left ) from restarts because he is so strong at receiving back - row moves they seem to have vanished from the international game but they remain a vital weapon			1
keep it simple and take the pressure off the backs by calling a back - row move			2
this is as simple as no 8 picks up , runs , passes to the scrum - half who feeds the full back — @entity12 have great talent in the backs so just give them the ball early and let them play			1
drop goals just like back - row moves , @entity12 seem to have forgotten the value of drop goals			1
forwards love them because , even when defences are on top , they provide a means to keep the scoreboard ticking , which is a must , especially away from home			2
@entity21 ’s defence is one of the best but they can not defend a drop goal			2
it provides a massive lift and can be a real dagger to the opposition			0
@entity5 watches over @entity12 's training session at @entity272 in @entity273 on friday the contact area @entity12 need to bring some real pain to the contact area and let this @entity157 side know they are in a physical battle from the word go			1
a great win of @entity281 ’s , often forgotten , was the victory in @entity21 two years ago			2
it is forgotten because @entity12 got hammered in @entity284 a few weeks later but in that win in @entity21 , the @entity12 pack were awesome			1
my favourite word at the moment is ‘ grit ’			0
sheer , bloody grit will go a long way tomorrow			0
this @entity12 pack should relish the chance to show the world how tough they are			1
in forwards coach @entity295 they have an excellent role model			2
forwards coach @entity295 is an excellent role model for @entity12 's work in the contact area this @entity12 pack should relish the chance to show the world how tough they are under @entity295 they must explode into the game and flood the breakdown with a minimum of three players in addition to the ball carrier in order to smash the opposition			1
it ’s a strength of @entity21 ’s but i want to see @entity12 dominate them at the breakdown			1
i believe they can do that			0
@entity12 need to go straight through the middle of the @entity157 breakdown as often as possible because it provides a massive psychological blow			2
we used to call it ‘ killer ’ because of the damaging effect it had on opponents when they knew you had the physical and technical attributes required to just smash through them			0
it ’s the ultimate pressure builder			0
if @entity12 can build pressure , they ’ll win			1
@entity329 and @entity33 will have a big impact but whichever fly - half is given the easier ride will emerge victorious			0
@entity12 ’s pack will dominate this game - so they should win by five points			1
@entity33 ( left ) and @entity329 ( right ) will have a big impact but are relying on the forwards to help them out			0

@entity12 face @entity21 as the @entity45 ' *unbeaten* sides meet in @entity42
@entity5 made an excellent call picking @entity2 on the wing
the top - of - the - table clash on sunday will be won by the forwards
@entity5 's pack can create pressure with their speed and intensity
