booby - trapped @entity2 weapon caches which date back to the @entity3 are probably still buried across @entity4 , a top historian has claimed			2
professor @entity5 , an expert on the history of the intelligence services , made the claim after a secret archive released today revealed the location of several arms dumps across @entity12			1
@entity2 spies dug the stores under trees and farmland near major cities , and filled them with small arms and communications devices in case undercover agents needed to defend themselves			0
treasure hunt : @entity2 weapons caches just outside @entity26 , @entity27 , are detailed in the @entity28 , parts of which have been revealed for the first time today			2
an expert said there are bound to be similar stores in @entity4 their existence is detailed in the @entity28 , a collection of thousands of @entity2 intelligence documents compiled by a defector and made public for the first time today			1
disillusioned kgb major @entity39 amassed the collection over more than a decade before walking into the @entity4 embassy in @entity43 in 1992 shortly after the fall of the @entity2			1
defector : kgb major @entity39 walked into the @entity4 embassy in @entity43 with a vast trove of files those who saw him said he looked like a homeless man and he had buried the files , described as one of the greatest hauls in @entity4 history , under dirty underwear in his suitcase			1
in the notes stored at @entity60 's @entity59 , @entity61 - who died in 2004 - described the locations in incredible detail along with booby traps			0
describing a stash near @entity67 , @entity68 , he wrote directions to a chapel near a farm and added : ' after taking 36 steps , you will be at the point between two large leafy trees , the only ones in the sector			1
' the distance between the trees is three paces ... the area between the trees has been used for the cache			0
' a map included in the archive pinpointed three sites , named @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , around @entity26			0
and another note provided instructions on how to disarm an explosive booby trap called molniya or @entity93			0
it read : ' when digging out the container from the earth , take care not to strike the handle by chance			0
' the handle must only be turned and the container tilted and taken out of the hole after the explosive device has been disarmed			0
' some of the caches have since been uncovered , but many are likely to remain today , said prof @entity5 , a friend of @entity39 who has written two books about his vast trove of documents			1
although the archive does not detail caches on @entity4 soil , professor @entity5 insisted they must exist			1
' this was a large scale operation and the caches were strategically placed in most @entity116 countries during the @entity3 , ' he said			0
handwritten : the @entity118 's notes ( pictured ) described the location of weapons stores in intricate detail trove : a list of @entity2 agents operating abroad ( left ) is contained within the newly - released files ( right ) ' given that @entity4 was second only to the @entity126 in terms of importance to the @entity2 at this time , it would be remarkable if this tactic was n't deployed here			1
' however , those hoping to lay their hands on a dangerous piece of history would be disappointed , prof @entity5 said			2
he explained : ' of course by now they would not be easy to find and it is unlikely the weapons would be serviceable			2

files compiled by kgb major @entity39 , who moved to @entity4 in 1992
his archive - revealed today - details several weapons dumps across @entity12
one in @entity68 involves taking 36 steps from a chapel near a farm
none mentioned are in @entity4 , but expert said they are almost certainly here
prof @entity5 added : ' by now they would not be easy to find '
