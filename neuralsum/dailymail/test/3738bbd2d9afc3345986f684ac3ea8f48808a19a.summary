@entity1 clubs are poised to do battle over a late @entity4 move to cash in on the @entity6 play - offs			1
currently second in the @entity9 , the @entity8 club stand to make £ 1million from anticipated sell - out home gates against @entity11 and the 11th place club in the @entity6 - currently @entity13			1
under recently passed @entity1 rules , however , play - off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play - off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days			1
and , faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches , @entity4 chairman @entity22 has garnered support from @entity24 and @entity13 for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play - off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent			1
the issue will go to the vote at the @entity30 next thursday , but faces opposition from the @entity1 board who believe the move puts self - interest above those of all 42 clubs			0
@entity4 face a battle over potentially lucrative gate revenues with lower league clubs on tuesday , one senior club figure told @entity42 on condition of anonymity , that the @entity4 , @entity24 and @entity13 proposal was ‘ outrageous ’			1
‘ the agreement two years ago was that the clubs from the bottom three divisions would get more of the money , ’ @entity46 was told			0
‘ as part of that overall package we agreed a levy on the play - offs			2
no one at that time anticipated you might have a @entity11 - @entity4 play - off final			0
‘ now there is a move by people with vested interests to say “ we might be doing ourselves out of a bit of money ! ”			0
and they are attempting to revisit it			0
‘ that ’s potentially outrageous because all clubs voted for the restructuring on the basis of the overall package and you ca n’t suddenly decide later that because you are in the play - offs you are not happy with it			2
’ @entity4 declined to comment last night although the @entity8 club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six - figure broadcast deal for the play - offs and the imposition by the @entity1 of new minimum pricing policy of £ 15 and £ 10 for all six matches			1
@entity4 would have to hand over 50 per cent of play - off gate revenues to lower league clubs under @entity1 rules @entity4 are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next thursday from @entity13 – also likely to be involved in the play - offs – and city rivals @entity24			1
one @entity8 source told @entity42 : ‘ a rule change has been introduced by the @entity1 stopping clubs allowing their season ticket holders into the play - off games for free			0
‘ they have also imposed a minimum price of £ 15 and £ 10 for the play - offs			2
‘ in addition there was no television money in place for the play - offs last year while this year they have secured six - figure revenues to go round the clubs			2
‘ add in the fact the parachute payments to the @entity6 clubs are fully funded by the @entity102 – not the @entity1 – and people at @entity4 take the view that to hand back 50 per cent of the money generated is excessive and unnecessary			0
the suggestion that it be reduced is not unreasonable			0
