the operations are in support of the legitimate government of @entity6 against an insurgency , he said			2
' it is a combat deployment , but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of @entity6 and ultimately the people of @entity1 from the murderous rage of the @entity57 death cult			1
' @entity57 must be disrupted and degraded at home and abroad , so it is absolutely in @entity1 's national interests that this mission go ahead			2
