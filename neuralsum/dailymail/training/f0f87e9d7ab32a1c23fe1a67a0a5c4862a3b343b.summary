now , in newly - released @entity11 footage from fittings with her wedding dress designer @entity13 , we see the 30 - year - old 's emotional reaction the first time she saw herself in her gown			1

' the two videos , one from a toile fitting , and one with the finished dress , offer a detailed look at the actress 's dramatic gown , and tell the story of how it came to be			1
' because i love minimalism and i love a clean line so much , i knew that i did n’t want any embellishments in the dress , ' ms @entity1 said			2
' so i spoke to @entity53 [ and ] he loved the idea about having the drama in the back			0
so i knew that was going to be perfect			0

story of a dress : the two @entity67 videos , one from a toile fitting , and one with the finished dress , offer a detailed look at the actress 's dramatic gown making changes : the length of the train , which is 8ft long and 16ft wide , was a later decision - an idea that came about during the toile fitting ' when we first tried on the muslin , the train was a bit shorter , and we all felt that because it was such a restrained look , that we could go with more length and a little bit more drama , ' she said			1
' the veil is actually a cathedral length veil , traditionally a cathedral length veil moves even further past the end of the dress , but we proportioned it to the dress			2
' the result was an overwhelming success			0
' i love the dress because when you see the front , it feels so minimal then when you turn around there 's just this dramatic sort of glorious fall of the fabric , ' the actress says			1
' it looks like it has weight and a heaviness to it , but yet it feels light as air			0
there 's just so much poetry and elegance to it			2
' minimalist : the actress wanted the dress to be restrained in the front , with clean lines statement : the back , however , was all drama , with fabric cascading into a cathedral - length train at the final fitting for her dress , ms @entity1 also selected her accessories from a vintage - look selection by jeweler @entity129			1
' because my dress is so restrained and has such a minimal feel to it , i thought , oh the embellishment should really shine , and the jewelry , ' she said			0

it was really difficult to choose because they 're all so beautiful			0
' ms @entity1 , who is seen greeting the fashion designer with a kiss on both cheeks , says she is honored that he agreed to design her dress , ' @entity53 is the most legendary designer , in my opinion , ever , ' she says in the clip			1
' he has such a great mark on @entity152 elegance , and i ’m such an admirer of his life and his work			0
there is no one else for me			0
' crowning glory : at the final fitting for her dress , ms @entity1 also selected her accessories from a vintage - look selection by jeweler @entity129 vintage style : she selected diamond studs and a tiara to complete the look in turn , mr @entity13 says he is delighted to have been tasked with the job			1
' i am extremely honored that you chose me , ' he says			0
' it 's probably the most special day in any woman 's life , so i 'm very excited to be involved in this			0
' like any other bride - to - be , the actress seemed as though she could n't wait to open up about her wedding plans			2
' @entity6 and i talk about this a lot - i think there 's two ways that we 'll both go it 'll either be very emotional or we 'll just kinda start laughing			1
