when beloved family pet cat @entity2 disappeared in 2011 his owners soon gave him up for dead			1
but little did they know the tomcat had wandered into a @entity6 pasty factory 30 miles away and was being spoilt rotten - living on a rich diet of pastries and sandwiches fed to him by staff			1
the animal ’s adventure came to an end last week when workers decided to hand him in to the local vets			2
returned : stunned owners @entity19 and @entity20 suspect @entity2 lived on a diet of pastries after spending the last three years in a @entity6 pasty factory a scan of his microchip revealed he belonged to @entity19 and @entity20 , of @entity26 , near @entity27 , @entity28 , and the cat has now been returned home			1
and far from looking bedraggled after his three year absence , @entity2 seems to have piled on the pounds			1
mother - of - three @entity19 , 58 , said : ' he went out one morning as cats do and we never saw him again			1
' then nearly three years on , we get a call from the vets saying we have got your cat here			2
i looked at our other cat @entity40 and told them they must be mistaken			2
' then it suddenly registered they must mean @entity2			2
home sweet home : mrs @entity46 was stunned when @entity2 was found alive and well after running away in 2011 ' the vet said he had been living in the @entity6 pasty factory in @entity49 and one of the workers had been looking after him			1
we never expected to see him again , not after he ’d been missing for three years			0
' he ’s a heavy cat now - he ’s quite large			2
we think that he may have been eating all the pasties and sandwiches up there			0
' he ’s probably been given lots of titbits from staff there			0
' @entity2 had been adopted by workers who let him have free reign of the offices during the day , fed him on @entity6 products and renamed him ‘ @entity67 ’			1
staff at the pie factory 33 miles away say he roamed the grounds outside at night and was always there to welcome workers when they arrived in the morning			2
high life : @entity2 had been adopted by workers at @entity6 pasty factory , pictured , who fed the runaway a rich diet of pastries and sandwiches since his return mrs @entity46 said @entity2 had settled in - apart from the ' odd hiss ' at their other cat @entity40 who was just a kitten when he disappeared			1
mrs @entity46 said : ' he came home on tuesday evening , came straight into the house and just stretched out in the chair as if nothing had happened			0
' he ’s like @entity88			0
he ’s unfazed by it			0
' the grandmother - of - one said she was dumbfounded as to how @entity2 had ended up at the pasty factory near @entity93			1
she said : ' we have no idea how he ended up there , but cats are curious			0
diet : @entity99 returned three years after disappearing rather more plump than when he left - possibly due to being fed on pasties from a nearby @entity6 factory not going hungry : @entity2 had managed to find his way to a @entity6 factory , pictured , 30 miles away from his home where staff kept him fed with scraps ' we think he may have climbed into the back of a lorry delivering to the co-op store and gone unnoticed by the driver			1
' or he could have jumped into someone ’s car who was visiting the area when they opened the door			0
' we just do n’t know			0
it ’s just a miracle he ’s here after three years			0
' mrs @entity46 said the vet had advised her not to let @entity2 out for a couple of weeks while he adjusted to his surroundings			2
' there is a worry that he will just go off again , ' she said			0
' but we are just glad to have him home			0
' @entity6 said they were unaware of the incident but were ' delighted ' @entity2 had been reunited with his owners			1
a spokesperson said : ' as you would expect from a food manufacturer , we have very strict procedures to ensure that stray animals do not venture into the perimeter of our premises at any time			0
' we have not been made aware of this particular incident , however , we are always pleased to hear of a nice ending to a story and delighted that @entity2 has been reunited with its owners			1
