@entity4 , 28 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , was forced to cut back when her husband took a break from the @entity9 to go back to school			1
with just his living allowance to survive on , she set about mastering the art of frugal living , teaching herself how to cook , learning how to sew and avoiding impulse shopping sprees			1

' i had to learn to change the way i was spending , in order for my family to save money and live a healthier life ' one of the first things that she did was go to a thrift store and buy a $ 7 bread maker			1
' it â€™s so good and it saves a lot of money , ' she told @entity53			0
and every cent counts because the @entity55 get by on a $ 400 a month grocery budget			2
they are members of a food co-op , and they pay cash in grocery stores to ensure that they do n't go over their allowance			1
' once that $ 400 is gone , it is gone			2
there are no extra shopping trips made because there is no more money , ' she writes			2
crafty cook : mrs @entity4 gives her daughter ( left ) home - made granola bars instead of store - bought snacks , and thanks to a $ 7 bread maker , does all her own baking ( right ) as well as her breadmaker mrs @entity4 's freezer is also her best friend			1
she freezes baked goods , vegetables and fruits along with dairy products such as cheese , butter and yogurt			0
' i am able to freeze about 8 gallons of milk each @entity88 sit at the bottom of my freezer and we thaw them out when we need them , ' she explains			0
her kitchen is stuffed full of cookbooks which allow her to rustle up meals from scratch			0
their most impressive saving , though , was the bargain price they paid for their home			2
determined not to have a mortgage , they saved $ 30,000 with a plan to buy a cheap foreclosure			1
cheap and chic : mrs @entity4 's husband calls her ' a @entity110 robot ' thanks to her new crafting skills they were in luck when they found a home for just $ 28,000 , and spent the remaining $ 2,000 installing wood flooring and a kitchen that the property had been lacking			1
but before her husband , @entity16 , 31 , left the @entity9 , mrs @entity4 had already started cutting back			1
source : @entity121 and domestic in 2008 when he served his second deployment in @entity124			0
she was left in charge of the family finances and she became determined to save $ 30,000 to put down a downpayment on their home by the time he returned			1
' i never paid anything growing up - i was kind of spoiled			2
and then , all of a sudden , i had to do all the bills			0
it was tough , ' she said			0
but everything changed when her husband told her to read @entity141 's @entity140 : your guide to @entity144 , @entity145 , and cashing in on your dreams			2
the book is an account by @entity149 and @entity150 , who feed their family of seven on just $ 350 a month			1
it was the first time mrs @entity4 had ever heard of once - a - month grocery shopping , which changed her approach to buying food for her family of four			1
' i changed the way i was grocery shopping and started working my way up , ' she recalled			2
she also gained insight into how much money is wasted when things are n't budgeted			0
' everything must be budgeted			0
from family outings , to toiletries to clothes purchases			0
it must be budgeted , ' mrs @entity4 wrote last june			0
she cancelled cable tv and signed up to @entity170 , so her two children aged six and eight had some form of entertainment			0
the family also uses a simple antennae to pick up basic cable channels			0
everything in the home is either handmade or second - hand and she swears by a home - made laundry detergent recipe			1
today they have have barely any credit card debt , no car loan payments and no mortgage			2
they do have a credit card , but only use it for emergencies , paying back the balance fast by working repayments into their monthly budget			0
' we recently had some medical bills we had to pay , and we were able to take our savings and pay those down as fast as we could , ' mrs @entity4 told @entity53			0
another means of cutting back was fuel for their two cars ( both paid for in cash , like their home )			1
the couple only fill the tanks once a month by carefully planning each outing to make the most of the gas used			0
' we do n't go just for an hour , we stay and visit and even run errands that may be close to where we have family , ' mrs @entity4 said			0
' we try to remember that when the gas is gone ... it is gone			0
