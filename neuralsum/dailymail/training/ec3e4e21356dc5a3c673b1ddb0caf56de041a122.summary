by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:47 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 09:00 est , 31 october 2012 ministers have failed to devise a ‘ credible ’ growth strategy and must put the country on an economic ‘ war footing ’ , according to @entity8 grandee @entity6			1
the @entity8 grandee , who raised eyebrows in @entity11 by commissioning a cartoon for the cover of his report , calls on the prime minister to establish a @entity16 to rival the @entity17 and to appoint a minister for growth			1
he adds that @entity19 and @entity20 must act now on immigration , airports and energy policy if they want to boost growth , but his comments were seized on by @entity27 as proof the government 's strategy is not working			2
@entity6 commissioned this cartoon for the front cover of his report lord @entity6 – who helped to revitalise @entity32 and @entity33 when he was @entity34 ’s environment secretary in the 1980s – also calls on the government to take a much more hands - on approach to funnelling cash to the regions			1
in his report published today - @entity40 - he urges the @entity41 to ‘ clarify urgently ’ where it wants to build a new hub airport before the next election and seek approval from voters in 2015 , rather than delay any decision until after the election			2
the government should also ‘ accelerate the pace at which it is tackling illegal immigration , overstayers and the backlog of residency applications ’ with an immediate injection of resources and staff , he adds			0
only when illegal residents are removed , he says , will the government be able to persuade more skilled workers to come to the @entity60			0
today mr @entity20 said : ' i wanted @entity6 to do what he does best : challenge received wisdom and give us ideas on how to bring @entity35 and industry together			2
' he has done exactly that			0
this is a report bursting with ideas and we will study it very carefully			0
' @entity6 's wide - ranging report demands @entity20 do more to intervene to stimulate growth			1
the chancellor was out jogging in @entity73 yesterday before @entity74 met in @entity75 some in @entity11 think the report will be quietly shelved			1
@entity6 takes aim at ministers squabbling over nuclear power and renewable energy , saying they must ‘ set out a definitive and unambiguous energy policy ’ so businesses have the certainty they need to invest			2
the report , entitled @entity85 : in pursuit of growth , says the @entity16 should send money to @entity88 in struggling areas and work with a series of @entity91 in key sectors of the economy			2
he adds : ‘ a @entity95 must be created in consultation with the business community , setting out a progressive vision for wealth creation over the long term			0
’ @entity6 also demands that everyone works harder to promote growth			1
he said : ‘ too often we think of he country ’s economic problems as something beyond us as individuals ... we all need to raise our game , and keep raising it			0
’ asked if mr @entity19 needs to put the country on an economic war footing , @entity6 said : ‘ we have a national crisis			1
‘ we need to engage the war psychology , that we ’re all in this together			0
and this can only happen with concerted national leadership			0
labour leader @entity116 said @entity6 's report proved the government 's economic strategy is ' not the answer ' ‘ it ’s a war against complacency and indifference , and on all those who feel they do n’t have a role to play , when they do			1
’ at prime minister 's questions today @entity27 leader @entity116 said @entity6 's criticism was proof the government 's economic strategy is not working			1
mr @entity116 told mr @entity19 : ' you say @entity6 's report says you 're on the right track ; goodness knows what his report would have said if he had said you 're on the wrong track			1
' he said there was no strategy for jobs and growth , business had no confidence ( and ) deregulation - your chosen approach - is not the answer			1
' @entity6 said in his report there were people who were ' resistant ' to his recommendations			2
mr @entity116 added : ' we know who they are ; the chancellor and the prime minister			1
' the evidence of the last two years is that deregulation , sink or swim , their answer is not the answer			0
@entity6 is right and they 're wrong			2
" but mr @entity19 today hailed the ' excellent report ' and repeatedly denied it criticised current government policies			0
' what he is saying is that over decades in our economy , it became too centralised , regions and nations of our countries fell behind , manufacturing halved as a share of national income during the last government , and , for instance , during the boom years in the @entity177 there were no net private sector jobs			0
' the report was commissioned by mr @entity19 ’s former policy guru @entity181 , who left to work in the @entity182 earlier this year			0
mr @entity20 is expected to adopt some of his proposals in the autumn economic statement to @entity185 next month			0
despite his criticisms on growth , @entity6 , 79 , does explicitly back the government ’s economic strategy , saying it has ‘ rightly focused on getting debt under control ’ , which has ‘ cut the deficit by 25 per cent and reduced the cost of borrowing ’			1
shadow treasury minister @entity196 said : ‘ it ’s a damning indictment of this government that , halfway through this parliament , a former conservative cabinet minister is still calling for a plan for growth			0

business secretary tells *mps* the prime minister 's @entity206 has not met - before remembering it has , and he was there
former *deputy* *pm* @entity6 will *tomorrow* launch a wide - ranging report demanding the chancellor do more to *bolster* economic growth
