from national security data to secret company information , some of the most sensitive documents are stored on computers that are never connected to the internet			1
this precaution of keeping such information on an ‘ air - gap ’ network is popularly considered the safest way to prevent hackers from accessing it			1
but computer scientists from @entity13 in @entity14 have found a way to attack these machines and ‘ steal ’ the confidential data			1
the finding means that some high profile machines may not be as safe from hackers ( illustrated ) as previously thought ' @entity29 gaps ' currently used to protect important computers could be rendered useless			1
an air - gap or air wall is a network security measure			1
it was designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks , such as the internet or a local area network			2
the researchers from @entity14 designed computer software that logs keystrokes			2
this software transmits these strokes via @entity45 radio signals generated by the computer 's graphics card			1
the data is picked up by a nearby mobile , equipped to pick up radio signals			0
in the example case , the researchers used a @entity53 and had to plug in the headphones to get the radio receiver to work			0
this can be done without being detected by the user , but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place			0
since @entity45 radio signals can travel over long distances , the receiver could be placed in another building			2
a new method of protecting these machines will now have to be found , claimed the researchers			2
in an experiment designed to highlight the danger facing machines in an air - gap , the researchers assumed that the attacker has already broken into a protected system to sneak out new data			1

the researchers from @entity14 designed computer software that logs keystrokes , @entity84 reported			2

and since fm radio signals can travel over long distances , the receiver could be placed in another building			0
a new method of protecting these machines will now have to be found , claimed the researchers			2
they demonstrated that a hacker could use it to collect data from devices protected by an air - gap in a paper , which they presented at the @entity119 on @entity120 ( @entity121 )			1
' the scenario is that you go to a secure facility and leave your cell phone at the entrance , ’ said @entity127 , chief technology officer for the cyber security labs at the university			0
‘ the virus will send the data to your phone			0
’ ‘ such a technique can be used potentially by people and organisations with malicious intentions and we want to start a discussion on how to mitigate this newly presented risk			0
’ commentators said the @entity142 technique is a refinement of methods used by intelligence agencies since the mid 1980s to bypass machines protected with passwords ( stock image ) and other measures last year , @entity151 computer scientists proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans			1
using built - in microphones and speakers in laptops , the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft ( 19 metres ) away from each other			2
they came up with a hack using sound to steal data from protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘ hacker ’ machine			1
the researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a @entity179 computer to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another			0
commentators say the @entity142 technique is a refinement of methods used by intelligence agencies since the mid 1980s			0
it was known that electromagnetic signals could be intercepted from computer monitors to reconstitute the information being displayed			0
hackers have turned monitors into radio - frequency transmitters and it is thought that the @entity195 has used radio - frequency devices implanted in various computer - system components to transmit information and exfiltrate data			2
@entity142 has the edge , however , because it uses off - the - shelf components such as a smartphone as a receiver			1
but the method is still slow , transferring less than 60 bytes a second and only at a distance of between 3ft ( one metre ) and 22ft ( seven metres )			0
this allows someone with a smartphone to steal data from nearby systems and send it to another hacker			1
' this is the first time that a mobile phone is considered in an attack model as the intended receiver of maliciously crafted radio signals emitted from the screen of the isolated computer , ’ the researchers said in a statement			1
the university 's findings have reignited a discussion about whether air gap networks are still effective and the experts are now working on a way of protecting machines from such a breach			1
the only measure they know of so far is to lock computers in metal enclosures and within walls that are thick enough to disrupt radio frequencies , stopping the transmission of sensitive data .			0

sensitive machines are often protected on an *offline* ' air - gap ' network
this is considered to be the most effective way to keep data safe
but computer scientists from @entity13 , @entity14 , have found a way to attack machines and ' steal ' data , called the @entity142 method
they used a smartphone *capable* of receiving @entity45 signals
experiment means new protective measures will have to be found
