click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3 his assessment - that the atmosphere at @entity3 ‘ is getting worse ’ - was brutal , but @entity6 has a knack of hitting upon issues @entity10 fans want addressing			1
despite sitting top and unbeaten , these supporters are n't all a merry bunch			0
going to home games was n't what it once was			2
the place is flat and the club do n't seem sure how to fix the problems			0
to suggest this is down to apathy or complacency is lazy - there is more to it than that			2
@entity6 has clearly noticed it			1
‘ playing here is like playing in an empty stadium , ’ was his damning verdict after a relatively soulless afternoon in which the leaders picked up another three points in their pursuit of regaining the @entity32 crown			1
@entity6 was unhappy with the crowd as @entity10 fought their way past @entity37 at @entity3 a single @entity10 fan before the match - but @entity6 claimed the whole match felt like the stadium was empty @entity41 scored his fifth penalty since january			1
only @entity43 ( six ) has scored more for @entity10 in a @entity32 calendar year the dig was n’t so thinly - veiled - the manager clearly stated he believes the @entity47 are the worst supported club at home in the division			1
@entity10 supporters are , quite rightly , insulted by that			1
but they also realise travelling to @entity52 is intimidating because of the team @entity6 sends out and not a lot else			1
pricing strategies and the way in which this club ’s image has transformed since @entity60 ’s arrival are obvious contributive factors to a damp environment			0
the clientele is unrecognisable to those who witnessed a goalless draw against @entity66 here 15 years ago this week			0
‘ i think it ’s getting worse , ’ @entity6 said , shaking his head			1
‘ when comparing to my previous time i think it ’s getting worse			0
‘ i can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches			1
i do n’t question the passion and the love - i ’m nobody to question that and i know clearly that ’s not true			2
‘ @entity10 fans show us their passion for this club every day , but there is a certain line of living ( way of behaving ) at the matches at @entity3			1
’ @entity6 definitely struck upon something there			1
now a day at @entity87 has an almost @entity88 feel to it			1
those paying their extortionate amounts of money expect to be entertained in the same way a theatre lover would be in the evening			2
@entity41 scored the winning @entity10 goal from the penalty spot - his fifth since january the issue of money is never far away			1
' it 's £ 50 - plus to go , ' said @entity103 chairman @entity102			0
' and young people - who are the most likely to sing and make noise - have been priced out of the game			0
' the most expensive adult ticket on general sale this weekend was £ 75 , with the cheapest at £ 46			0
the @entity109 's recent @entity111 survey found that @entity10 's cheapest match - day ticket was the costliest in the country ; only @entity115 rivals @entity116 and @entity117 sell season tickets that are more exorbitant than @entity60 's club			1
@entity10 supporters want this issue tackling			1
@entity6 refused to go into detail as to why he felt the atmosphere had subsided , but fans believe it can be rectified by new policies surrounding pricing , stewarding , singing sections and safe standing			1
‘ the team then starts playing like it ’s a quiet , soft game at home , ’ added @entity6			1
the manager himself must , however , take on some of the blame			0
it was the @entity138 ’s decision back in 2005 to move away fans from behind his dugout in the @entity141 to the @entity3			1
that divided the raucous section behind the goal and it ’s never recovered			0
one disgruntled fan wrote an impassioned letter to @entity147 on instagram on sunday to relay his anger at @entity6 ’s comments			2
the captain vowed to get back in touch with answers			0
those at the club know what ’s going on but appear powerless to stop it			0
and their team were flat on saturday			0
it was the first time of a season that bares all the hallmarks of a procession to the title that they did n’t have it all their own way at home			0
@entity167 ’s @entity37 showed the sort of steel they ’ll need as we head into the new year ; they were set up to stifle and did so admirably for large parts			2
@entity167 will also be pleased that @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 return to training this week and @entity177 continues to find the net			0
@entity41 ( left ) and @entity179 ( right ) scored a goal apiece to secure three points for @entity10 but @entity6 was visibly agitated throughout			1
first he was n’t happy with the lack of floodlights on a gloomy afternoon in west @entity115 , then his players were handed a dressing down at the break - despite leading			0
‘ at half - time he was not happy and told us we had n't played well and had to do better , @entity186 said			0
‘ it was dangerous for us , to be only 1 - 0 up			2
so we had to improve			0
he was right because even then @entity37 came on to the pitch for the second half and scored their goal to get level			2
‘ but at least we reacted			0
we had to run more , keep the ball better , get at them more			0
’ @entity6 ’s scathing attack on his own supporters may have been unwitting , but it ’s amplified a growing unrest of a group whose lack of voice has drawn attention to their ongoing plight .			2

@entity10 beat @entity37 2 - 1 in a hard - fought match at @entity3
@entity6 described the match as ' like playing in an empty stadium '
he is right *...* the *audience* now are almost like a @entity88 theatre crowd
@entity6 also claimed @entity10 have the worst home support in the league
