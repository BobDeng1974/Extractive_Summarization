@entity1 winger @entity0 looks like he is starting to finally settle into @entity3 football after manager @entity4 urged him to be more aggressive			1
that advice backfired when he was sent off just 15 minutes after coming on as a substitute in the club 's @entity8 exit against @entity10 last week after flailing an arm into an opponent 's face			1
however , employed on the left - hand side of a midfield four , requiring more defensive effort than he is used to , against @entity18 on wednesday the 20 - year - old impressed and scored his first goal for the club			1
@entity0 nets @entity1 's second goal during their 3 - 1 @entity23 victory over @entity18 ' i thought it was a great finish			1
i thought he was excellent in a role where we asked different tactical elements from him , ' said @entity4			0
' his energy and quality was good and he was a real threat for us			0
' @entity4 added on @entity35 : ' it has taken him a bit of time to get going and we have talked to him about being more aggressive in his game			0
' in the 15 minutes before he got sent off against @entity10 - and it was disappointing that he was sent off - because he started really well			2
that 's the @entity0 that we know			2
' playing in that role ( against @entity18 ) he was outstanding ; he was defensively good and pressed the ball at almost all of the right times , so tactically he was very good			2
@entity47 ( centre ) looks shocked as @entity0 ( right ) is sent off against @entity10 at @entity49 ' and with the ball his speed and movement was excellent			1
he has got good quality and is a good footballer			0
at 20 years of age , he looks like he is improving all the time			0
' @entity0 cost @entity1 £ 20million when he moved from @entity57 as one of @entity60 's brightest talents but he has so far failed to show many glimpses of his potential			1
the @entity64 international will hope he did enough in midweek to retain a place to face @entity66 at home on sunday			1
@entity1 need a good performance against the in - form @entity69 , who have scored four goals in their last two matches in the @entity73 and @entity60			1
@entity4 ( above ) signed @entity0 for £ 20million from @entity57 during the summer they have scored just seven goals in eight matches at @entity49 in the league this season , goals which have produced just 12 points at home , and they are five points adrift of sixth - placed @entity66 before this weekend 's matches			1
having lost to @entity82 last weekend to fall 10 points behind their arch - rivals they can ill - afford another defeat to a top - four competitor			0
asked what a victory over @entity66 would do for their season , never mind their confidence , @entity4 added : internally , it will continue our spirit and our focus			2
@entity97 ( right ) could make his first start since september for @entity1 against the @entity69 ' for us it will good for confidence			0
but it will be a difficult game			0
' they are a top side with outstanding players			0
they did okay at home last week winning 4 - 1 against @entity107 and they played really well			2
' they have outstanding players but we will look to focus on ourselves			0
' defender @entity47 faces a late test to see whether he has recovered from the groin problem which forced him off against @entity18 but it seems likely @entity97 could deputise in a newly - formed back three , which would be his first start in the league since mid-september .			1

@entity0 cost @entity1 £ 20million when he moved from @entity57
