' you have to have steady hands , and you have to be able to repeat small motions over and over with perfect precision			2
' take a pizza commercial for example			0
a crew will spend hours painstakingly choreographing what will turn out to be a three - second shot			0
' so in i come , the rest of my body at a bizarre angle so it 's hidden out of the way , and then i wait for the crew to call action , ' she explains			0

' one job i did for @entity234 required me to push six beer bottles across the table and have them spin so the label stopped in front of the camera , ' she says			0
' my body was out of the shot and the set - up meant i could n't even see my hands			2
but i practiced it enough times before the shoot that , incredibly , i nailed it on the first take			0
