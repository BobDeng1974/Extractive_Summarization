a heroic father has spoken of the moment he saved @entity3 ’s daughter after her @entity5 costume caught fire			1
@entity7 suffered second - degree burns when he plucked eight - year - old @entity9 from a group of children and put out the flames with his bare hands			1
his brave actions not only saved her from worse injury , they prevented her from setting fire to nine other children crowded on to a narrow doorstep			1
describing the terrifying accident for the first time , the restaurant owner said he was just feet away when he saw @entity9 ’s black ‘ wizard ’s costume ’ turn into a ‘ crackling ball of flame ’			1
to his horror , the synthetic fabric melted in his hands as he tried to tear it from the screaming child			2
and he warned other parents who dress their children in novelty costumes never to allow them near open flames			1
the 45 - year - old , who owns @entity46 restaurant in @entity47 , central @entity48 , had joined @entity49 , around five other parents and ten children on their annual west @entity48 trick or treating expedition			1
although he did not see exactly what set @entity9 ’s costume alight , it is thought her cape touched a pumpkin candle			1
he told the @entity59 : ‘ suddenly , @entity3 ’s daughter went up in a crackling ball of flame			1
all the children were wearing the same kit			2
it was like a potential horror film in front of me , because they were all going to go			2
once she goes , then the next one catches and they are all going to go off			0
‘ they were all on the doorstep together , right next to each other			0
so i just picked her up and lifted her over the children , got her on the pavement and tried to put her out			1
’ mr @entity7 said time seemed to slow down as he tried to extinguish @entity9 ’s flaming costume			1
shockingly , the fabric continued to burn as he patted her and rolled her on the pavement			0
he said : ‘ this material just keeps reigniting and re-burning			0
and it is sticky , so it melts on the skin			0
it was horrific to be honest			0
‘ i was trying to put it out with my hand			2
it was a warm night so i was n’t wearing a jacket			0
@entity3 with husband @entity87 ‘ there was nothing immediately to hand to put it out with			2
ideally i ’d have had something like a towel to douse it all out			0
but i did n’t have anything			0
there was n’t much time to think			0
‘ i was trying to roll her and pat her clothes			0
i was trying to rip the costume off her , which did n’t really help because it just ripped and dropped back			2
it is very bad material			0
‘ the costumes are very , very cheap to buy			2
they are nylon and they just go up			0
’ mr @entity7 ’s bravery left him with severe burns , and a week after the accident three fingers on his right hand are still in bandages			1
it is thought @entity9 has had several operations and may have to remain in hospital for several weeks			1
miss @entity3 and her husband @entity87 , both 42 , have said they are ‘ hopeful ’ their daughter will make a ‘ full recovery ’			0
miss @entity3 , who was replaced on last week ’s @entity121 by @entity122 , will not appear on the @entity124 show tonight and has not said when she will return			0
mr @entity7 played down his actions , saying : ‘ any parent would have done exactly the same thing so i do n’t think there is anything heroic about it			1
’ however , he admitted his own children have been left traumatised , adding : ‘ my little girl is petrified of candles now			2
she went to a birthday party the next day and did n’t want to go near a candle			0
’ last night , experts said children ’s fancy dress costumes have to comply with minimum fire resistance standards set out in the @entity139			1
but they warned it is impossible to create completely fireproof clothes			2
@entity142 , of the @entity143 , said : ‘ all clothes burn , some more quickly than others			0
the terrible irony is that fabrics such as polyester are actually more fire - resistant than cotton , but once they do set alight they are liable to melt and burn the skin further			1
sadly there is no easy fix except to warn parents when their children are around open flames , especially in loose clothing such as @entity5 cloaks			1

@entity7 suffered second - degree burns when he put out fire on @entity9 's costume
he said he was just feet away when he saw her black ' wizard 's costume ' turn into a ' crackling ball of flame '
mr @entity7 's brave actions saved the eight - year - old from worse injury
he warned parents not to let children in costumes near open flames
