by @entity0 for @entity1 discount supermarket @entity2 has banned sweets and chocolates from its checkout displays after complaints from parents about the ' pester power ' of their children			1
the @entity11 's fastest growing supermarket said racks of sweets will be replaced with dried and fresh fruit , nuts and juices , following a trial of these healthier options at checkouts earlier this year			1
from january 2015 , all confectionery , chocolate and sweets will be removed from @entity2 's checkouts and replaced with healthier options in a victory for health campaigners			1
from january 2015 , all sugary treats will be removed from @entity2 's checkouts and replaced with healthier options the decision follows a 16 week trial of healthier tills in a select number of @entity2 stores from february to june			1
@entity34 , joint managing director of corporate buying at @entity2 , said : ' the healthier tills trial enabled us to determine what our customers want at the checkout			1
' it quickly showed that healthier foods prove more popular with our shoppers than the traditional checkout offer of confectionery and sweets			2
' @entity2 takes a customer - focused approach , which involves helping our shoppers to lead healthier lifestyles			0
we are now pleased to be able to roll - out healthier tills as part of this			0
' @entity51 , nutritionist for @entity52 , told @entity1 : ' we are glad to hear this announcement from @entity2 , finally more and more retailers are ditching the horrifically unhealthy products from their checkouts , which only encourage " pester power " and makes the whole shopping experience more difficult for busy parents			2
' as a nation we should be reducing unnecessary sugar and calories from our diet and one of the ways to help us do this is to stop impulse buys			0
' an even better way is to make all the products healthier in the first place			0
we hope @entity2 are looking at making all of their products better for everyone			0
' the move by @entity2 follows a recent study by the @entity76 which found nine in ten items at the checkouts of supermarket convenience stores would be considered ‘ very unhealthy ’ , according to @entity81 guidelines			1
the vast majority of these were chocolate treats and stacked on shelves at one metre and below , which is directly in the eye - line of children aged three to five			0
the prime minister has previously lambasted stores for using this tactic , famously attacking @entity92 for putting boxes of chocolate oranges at checkouts			0
as far back as 2006 , the then @entity96 complained in a speech about ‘ irresponsible ’ marketing techniques by shops			0
@entity100 is one of the few remaining grocers still selling the snacks at checkouts similar moves were made by @entity105 in may this year at all its @entity107 and @entity108 stores after bosses found the most annoying part for parents was the ' pester ' factor at the checkout when small children wanted sugary treats			1
@entity2 's biggest rival @entity116 has also banned sweets from the so - called ' guilt aisles ' at at all 600 of its @entity11 stores			1
@entity120 's had scrapped sweets from its biggest store checkouts but has been criticised for continuing to sell confectionery at its convenience store checkouts , with a new shop opening almost every week			2
@entity100 is one of the few remaining grocers still selling the snacks at checkouts - although campaigners are pushing the government to pass a law making the practice illegal .			2
