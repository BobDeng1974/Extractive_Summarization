by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 06:00 est , 15 july 2013 botanists have attempted to cross-pollinate two giant plant species , in a bid to create the largest lily pad in the world			1
trainee botanist @entity6 , 17 , worked with experts at @entity8 on the @entity9 to delicately hand - pollinate an enormous @entity11 water lily that only blooms for two nights a year			1
the process mimics that performed in the wild by nocturnal scarab beetles attracted to the plant 's pungent pineapple - like scent over its two nights of flowering			2
a botanical marvel bloomed at the @entity8 on the @entity9 this weekend and 17 - year - old trainee botanist @entity6 ( pictured ) 17 , had to bravely don her swimsuit to hand - pollenate lilies the giant @entity11 lily flowers for just two nights a year and ms @entity6 had to plunge into the pool to remove pollen from @entity29 on its first flowering to replicate the process performed by a nocturnal scarab beetle attracted to its heavy pineapple like scent in the wild the unusual plant blooms in white on the first night , then changes sex and flowers the following night a deep red before sinking back under the water			1
the botanists are attempting to create a hybrid of water lily species @entity29 and @entity44 and it is hoped the resulting plant will be the largest lily in the world			2
the massive plants , as wide as 6ft , grow at an extraordinary speed , transforming from a seed the size of a pea in just three months			1
their tiny seeds are placed in huge 8ft square pots holding two tonnes of manure , which are then submerged in 22,000 gallons of water			0
the unusual plant blooms in white on the first night , then changes sex and flowers the following night a deep red before sinking back under the water the massive plants grow at an extraordinary speed and were a pea - sized seed just three months ago			1
the flowers must be hand - pollinated by botanists such as ms @entity6 ( pictured ) using a paintbrush while they bloom for just two nights of the year but their lives are short - by october they will be @entity71 are grown at the gardens in a specially designed hot house powered by solar panels which recreates their natural growing conditions - the only place in the world to do so			1
inside the house the specially filtered water is kept at 26 degrees @entity80 , while the air temperature stays at a balmy @entity82 and 90 per cent humidity			0
@entity84 , curator of @entity8 , said : ' the reproduction cycle of the giant water lily is a facinating thing			2
' the first night 's flower is bright white and very highly scented like pineapple to attract a pollinator , in this instance a scarab beetle			1
botanist @entity84 is pictured with the photo voltaic cells brought in to boost the temperatures in the specially - designed hot house			2
the gardens in the @entity9 are the only place in the world to use this technology to recreate the lilies ' natural growing conditions ' when the scarab beetle enters the flower it is inclined to stay inside it because it feeds on the flower 's nectar - sweet glands plus it is about five degrees warmer inside the flower			1
' the flower then closes its petals , trapping the beetle inside			0
the following night , the flower opens again but this time it 's red and it has changed sex to male			0
' by this point the scarab beetle has eaten all the plant 's food so it goes off in search of a white flower , and pollination takes place			1
' mr @entity84 pointed out that as scarab beetles do not like in the @entity125 , botanists have to do the job for them			2
ms @entity6 does the job that a scarab beetle would do in the wild			1
the pineapple - scented flower attracts the beetle , and then traps it inside where it feeds on sweet nectar			0
when it re-opens it has changed colour and sex			0
the beetle moves on in search of another tasty white flower , and pollination takes place ' it means stripping off in the middle of the night and getting in the pool with the lilies			0
' we open up the flowers and transfer the pollen between plants using a paint brush			0
' the giant water lilies were named in honour of @entity155 @entity154 after their discovery by @entity125 botanists in the mid 19th century			2
the team at @entity8 are hoping their new species could smash the current world record for the largest water lily ever grown			0
the massive plants , as wide as 6ft , grow at an extraordinary speed , transforming from a seed the size of a pea in just three months			1
the tiny seeds ( pictured ) are placed in huge 8ft square pots holding two tonnes of manure , which are then submerged in 22,000 gallons of water mr @entity84 set the record of eight foot and nine inches in 1996 while working at @entity174			1
' by crossing the two species we will be able to grow a lily that is much bigger , ' he said			0
' it will have a very wide leaf but also a high ridge to its edge			0
' ' instead of leaves of about 6ft across , we are hoping it will have leaves of 9ft			0
' mr @entity84 said that this time next year , the botanists should know if they will be in the @entity188 or not .			0

trainee botanist @entity6 took on the role of a scarab beetle that would usually fertilise the giant @entity11 lilies in the wild
the massive plants grow at an extraordinary speed , transforming from a seed the size of a pea to a 6 - foot lily in just three months
previous record was set by @entity174 with a leaf - span of 8 foot and 9 inches but now botanists hope to break the 9 foot *barrier*
