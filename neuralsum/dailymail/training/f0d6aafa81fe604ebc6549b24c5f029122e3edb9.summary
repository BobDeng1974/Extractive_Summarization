by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 11:32 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 16 september 2013 millions of women invited for breast cancer screening will now get a leaflet explaining the drawbacks for the first time			1
the old leaflets were condemned as ‘ patronising ’ by experts because they exaggerated the benefits and did not spell out the risks			1
as a result , women could not make a properly informed choice about whether screening was right for them			0
millions of women invited for breast cancer screening will now get a leaflet explaining the drawbacks for the first time			1
this will help them make an informed decision about whether to have the screening mounting controversy over whether women were getting the full picture led to a major review into the @entity25 screening programme by the internationally recognised public health expert professor sir @entity27			1
the review concluded screening saves around 1,300 lives each year , but leads to 4,000 women having treatment for cancer they never needed			1
it found one per cent of all women going for @entity25 screening over 20 years would end up ‘ overdiagnosed ’ with cancer			1
this means they had cancer under the microscope but would not have had symptoms during their lifetime because the cancers were slow growing or non-aggressive			0
the review led to a recommendation last year from professor sir @entity47 , former national clinical director for @entity48 , that the leaflets be updated			0
in future women should be given ‘ clear and accessible ’ information before they go for a breast x-ray , or mammogram , so they could make up their own minds			0
from today the @entity55 will begin to use a new invitation letter and accompanying leaflet for women over 50 invited for screening every three years			2
the letter tells the woman it ’s ‘ your choice ’ whether or not to have screening , while the leaflet says some women will be diagnosed and treated for breast cancer that would otherwise never have been found or caused them harm			1
the old leaflets were condemned as ' patronising ' by experts because they exaggerated the benefits and did not spell out the risks			2
image shows breast cancer cells the leaflet spells out in bold type : ‘ overall , for every woman who has her life saved from breast cancer , about three women are diagnosed with a cancer that would never have become life - threatening			2
’ this is because at present doctors can not accurately identify cancers that will shorten life expectancy			0
the leaflet says researchers are trying to find better ways to tell which women have breast cancers that could be fatal and which do not			0
statistics from the review are included , with women being told that 4,000 of those going for screening each year will be offered treatment that ’s unnecessary			2
other risks include the worry and distress affecting women given an abnormal result that turns out to be wrong			0
the leaflet also says having a breast x-ray every three years for 20 years will itself very slightly increase the chance of cancer over a women ’s lifetime			1
and cancer will be missed in about one in 2,500 women screened , according to the leaflet			0
following a public consultation , the leaflet was drafted and tested with a @entity109 , in which 25 women were asked how they would like the information about the benefits and risks of breast screening to be presented			2
under the @entity25 screening programme , women are invited for three - yearly mammograms between the ages of 50 and 70 years			1
the age limits are being extended to 47 - 73			0
almost two million women in the @entity122 are screened each year			0
there have been fears some women will be deterred from attending for an x-ray by learning about the drawbacks which could make the programme , costing an estimated £ 96 million a year in @entity129 , less effective			0
screening saves around 1,300 lives each year , but leads to 4,000 women having treatment they never needed			1
this is because doctors can not tell whether cancer cells will become a problem or not professor @entity138 , director of the @entity55 , said : ‘ we believe that the leaflet now available to women provides a balanced assessment of the benefits and risks of breast screening and will support them as they decide whether to attend their screening appointment			1
’ professor sir @entity27 , chair of the independent breast screening review panel , said : ‘ my review of breast screening concluded that screening contributes to reducing deaths from breast cancer in women			1
‘ however , there are potential risks as well as benefits associated with breast screening , and it is important women are given information that is clear and accessible before they go for a mammogram			2
’ @entity164 , @entity165 , said : ‘ these new materials were developed following rigorous consultation with experts , and with women from the target audience			0
‘ the new materials will provide each woman with the clear , accurate information she needs to make a personal decision about whether to attend for breast screening			0

women will now be given a new leaflet explaining drawbacks
old leaflet was condemned as ' patronising ' as it exaggerated the benefits
screening saves 1,300 lives a year but leads to 4,000 women being treated unnecessarily because they have a *tumour* that would *n't* affect them
one per cent of women going for @entity25 screening over 20 years would end up ‘ overdiagnosed ’ with cancer
