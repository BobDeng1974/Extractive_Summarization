images of 12 of @entity2 's most wanted individuals have been released by the @entity3 as it intensifies its crackdown on the capital 's most evasive suspects this @entity7			1
the photos , which show six people being sought for burglary and six people sought for violence with injury offences such as grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm , have been uploaded to the @entity17 website in a public appeal for help			1
the dozen include @entity21 , 64 , wanted by @entity22 , who has 27 aliases and is accused of fleeing a series of bed and breakfast guesthouses without paying his bills ; and another man , @entity28 , 26 , who allegedly attacked a neighbour with a metal bar after an argument over loud music and is wanted by @entity33			1
the @entity2 - wide hunt for wanted offenders is part of a range of tactics being used to crack down on burglary and violence , as part of the @entity3 's ongoing commitment to drive down these type of crimes , arrest offenders and support victims			1
the @entity92 teams - which specialise in intelligence - led operations - have successfully arrested hundreds of hard - to - find wanted offenders including 30 burglars since november and dozens of individuals who have committed violent offences such as grievous bodily harm , actual bodily harm and attempted murder			1
they have also apprehended individuals wanted for domestic violence , child sexual exploitation offences and rape			1
latest figures show that between october 17 and december 8 , 368 wanted offenders were arrested for burglary and a total of 657 wanted offenders were arrested for violence with injury offences ( grievous bodily harm , actual bodily harm , manslaughter , attempted murder and murder ) across the @entity3			1
commander @entity138 , of @entity139 at the @entity3 , said : ' we are stepping up our activity to locate and arrest outstanding wanted suspects as part of our ongoing response to tackling burglary and violence in the capital			1
' we will not give up in the search to find people who flout the law and cause people misery and we will use every means available to catch them			2
' the use of fugitive teams and other daily operations will continue to ensure those wanted are caught , so they can face justice			2
' @entity158 launched on october 20 to target the 25 per cent rise in residential burglary offences traditionally seen during autumn and winter			1
a range of pro-active measures , including traditional tactics and the use of science and technology are being put to use , including high visibility patrols in burglary hot spots , driven by the use of predictive crime mapping			2
the @entity3 is making good use of predictive crime mapping , which takes historic crime data and models the likely locations of future criminal acts			2
this allows them to direct officers and other resources to key areas			0
the police now produce automated crime maps for every ward in @entity2 covering 14 different crime types			0
officers are using super cocooning to support victims and prevent offences in the surrounding neighbourhood , as following a burglary it is not uncommon that burglars will target a number of houses in the same street			2
@entity197 cocooning works by encouraging residents to be extra vigilant and security conscious			0
@entity200 pay a home visit to victims and their neighbours as soon as possible after an offence is reported to give crime prevention advice and gather local intelligence , while patrols are stepped up in the area			0
the police are constantly introducing new initiatives to help the public protect their property such as the free traceable liquid marking systems that mark property with a unique code identifiable to any police officer or second - hand goods buyer			0
treatment of 5,000 @entity2 homes across ten hot spots saw 767 fewer burglaries and an average drop in crime of 54 per cent in the last ten months of 2013			0
under @entity229 , the @entity3 maps second - hand markets , negotiates a voluntary @entity231 for premises to record sellers ' personal details , checks property with the @entity227 and informs local police when stolen property comes into their possession			2
there are regular visits and audit checks by local officers			0
latest figures ( rolling 12 months figures up to december 15 , 2014 ) show burglary offences have fallen by 12.8 per cent across the @entity3 compared to the previous rolling 12 months ( 11,247 fewer offences ) with the biggest reduction seen in residential burglary at 13.3 per cent ( 7,563 fewer offences )			1
in mid-october , the @entity3 launched @entity101 to reduce the number of violence - related offences across @entity2			1
it has seen boroughs across the capital join forces in a coordinated crackdown to target activity against a number of licensed venues , geographic areas and fast food outlets where violent offending disproportionately occurs			0
mps latest figures show there were 67,855 violence with injury ( this category mainly comprises grievous bodily harm , actual bodily harm and assault with injury ) offences in @entity2 ( rolling 12 months up to december 15 compared to same period last year )			1
this shows a 19.8 per cent rise from 56,651 the same period last year			0
@entity270 carried out on the figures indicates that the rise is likely to be attributable to improved recording practices rather than a rise in violence per se			0
a high proportion of these crimes typically occurs between the times of 6pm and 6am , and is often focused around licensed venues such as pubs , nightclubs and fast food outlets			0
in november and december , there is also traditionally a spike in such crimes as robbery , burglary and anti-social behaviour , the latter often fuelled by alcohol , which can be linked to violence			2
@entity101 is deploying resources across a wide range of activities - from problem - solving and crime prevention initiatives within wards / boroughs to an intensified focus on forensic retrieval and partnership work with licensed venue operators			0
it includes licensing inspections , enforcement of no - drinking zones and rigorous spot checks carried out in high - profile venues in collaboration with local authority licensing officers .			0
