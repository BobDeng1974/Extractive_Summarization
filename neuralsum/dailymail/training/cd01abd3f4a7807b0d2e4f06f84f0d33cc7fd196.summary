by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 03:45 est , 5 october 2012 they started to turn the town pink yesterday in the search for april @entity4			1
it began with three ribbons that the missing girl ’s mother tied in bows to the front gate of their home			1
then came a few more in the main street , on windscreen wipers , around tree - trunks and lamp - posts , in shop doorways and on lapels and handbags			2
even the landmark clock tower in the heart of town was draped in it			0
thus , in an extraordinary act of solidarity , the five - year - old ’s favourite colour became a symbol of hope that she can be safely returned to her family			1
the countless ribbons and swatches of pink also underlined a powerful community spirit – rarely encountered in many parts of @entity58 , but which hallmarked this remarkable little place from the moment hundreds of people came together to offer help in any way they could			1
one question is always asked first when friends meet in the street : ‘ any news yet ? ’ @entity40 is too big to be called a village but it feels like one			1
more than 2,200 people live here and everyone seems to know each other			0
the butcher is a former mayor ; several shopkeepers know april and her family personally ; people call the bobbies by their first names			1
the little market town has deep and historic roots in @entity83 , and is claimed in some circles to be the principality ’s ancient capital			0
yet its eclectic mix of inhabitants gives it a character unlike many other @entity83 communities , coloured by the scores of people who visited as tourists and came back to live			0
it has an almost bohemian atmosphere and has long been a magnet for hippies , environmentalists , ecologists – anyone with a love of the unspoilt countryside and spectacular mountain backdrops			0
the @entity107 , which aims ‘ to empower people to live a more sustainable life ’ , was founded in 1973 on the site of a disused quarry and draws visitors from around the globe			0
yesterday outside the vegan and vegetarian @entity115 in the main street , @entity114 sat in the welcome sunshine and pinned a pink ribbon to his pullover			1
he moved here 20 years ago from @entity121 and now considers himself a local			0
he had just volunteered to help search for april but was told by police that such help was no longer needed			1
symbol : the family launched a pink ribbon campaign to help sustain awareness of the search @entity131 ribbons are tied around several shop doorways in @entity40 @entity133 ignoring the advice , he and a friend spent three hours searching anyway with the friend ’s spaniel , examining outbuildings and lock - up garages they believed might not have been checked thoroughly on day one			1
‘ i actually felt guilty sitting at home doing nothing , ’ he told me			0
‘ every time before i turn the tv or radio on i get a sick feeling that there ’s going to be bad news			0
then i think it could be good news			0
but when there ’s no news , i feel i have to do something , anything , to help			0
’ the ‘ pink for april ’ initiative took off in response to a @entity156 appeal by april ’s mother @entity157 , who asked people to wear pink as a tangible sign that no one was giving up hope			1
‘ please keep looking for april , ’ she wrote			2
‘ she needs to come home			0
’ by the time the hunt completed its fourth day it was impossible to walk more than a few paces in @entity40 without encountering pink hope : the little girl 's favourite colour became a symbol of hope that she can be safely returned to her family superintendent @entity175 wearing a pink ribbon in support of a campaign to find april some users of the social network site changed their online photographs to pink ribbons to show support			1
poignantly , the campaign mirrored the sea of yellow ribbons that grew around @entity188 and @entity189 ’s home at the height of the search for missing @entity192			2
@entity193 , shopping in @entity40 , said the wait for news had been so agonising that being asked to participate even in something symbolic ‘ comes as something of a relief ’			1
most of the pink material spreading over @entity40 yesterday came from @entity203 ’s fabric and haberdashery in the centre of town			1
@entity203 could n’t make the little pink ribbons fast enough			1
about a hundred disappeared in a couple of hours			0
‘ i ’ve lost track of how many we ’ve distributed but i think i ’ve probably given out every bit of pink in the shop , ’ he said			2
‘ i could n’t just carry on working as normal			0
everyone here is doing something if they can			0
it ’s that kind of place			0
’ across the road , 16 - year - old sixth formers @entity4 and @entity222 were tying a long pink drape into a bow around railings at the foot of the clock tower			2
nearby was a ‘ kidnapped ’ appeal poster showing april in a pretty pink dress			1
both teenagers are friends of april ’s sister @entity232			2
‘ it ’s just our way of showing hope , and that we ’re all pulling together and thinking of april , ’ @entity4 said			1
in the desperate days since april was abducted , regular services have been held at both the town ’s central churches			2
forensic officers search suspect @entity33 's home in the village of @entity242 yesterday prime suspect @entity33 , left , who has been arrested in connection with april 's disappearance and a forensic officer , right , leaving his home holding what appears to be a package patrol : a mountain rescue team searches underwater along the @entity253 police search undergrowth close to the @entity253 yesterday in the hope of finding the missing girl so many people want to pray for april , however , that the doors have remained open all day			1
the @entity260 , vicar of @entity261 ’s , provided a book for messages of support and goodwill and it has been filling up by the hour			0
‘ it feels as if the whole town is carrying the weight on its shoulders , ’ she said			0
‘ there is a sense of urgency now but there is still hope			2
until someone tells us otherwise , april is alive – and we have to find her			2
’ video : pink ribbons over @entity40 as desperate serach for april continues			1

as hunt completed fourth day it was impossible to walk more than a few paces in @entity40 without encountering pink
