dark tourism is on the rise , with perhaps the best example of such a phenomenon being the ever - increasing interest in @entity5 as a holiday destination			1
april 26 , 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the explosion , which was one of the worst nuclear accidents that the world has ever seen			1
in recent years , visits to the nuclear explosion site have increased exponentially , with @entity15 - based tour company , @entity14 , estimating that it takes approximately 10,000 tourists there each year			1
at the time , the area was part of the @entity33 , but is now @entity23			0
the @entity34 , a nearly 50kilometre ( 31 - mile ) radius of contamination , runs around the power plant , although levels have now returned to those which are safe for brief visits to the area			1
however , such visitations are highly regulated and permitted only as part of an organised private tour			1
however , visits to the 50 - kilometre @entity34 , a contamination radius guarded by security , are highly regulated several private tour companies offer packages to the @entity34 , which in some cases even include overnight stays guests must provide documentation at several check points upon reaching the site via tour bus			1
once there , visitors are banned from touching anything , eating or drinking any food or beverage that does not come from outside the zone , and are even warned against sitting on the ground			2
needless to say , all discarded objects and property littered in and around the abandoned city must also remain			0
and exiting is likewise highly regulated , with several body scanners checking for high levels of radiation			0
once inside , visitors are banned from touching any objects or digesting any food that does not come from outside the zone however , day trips - and even overnight stays - are permitted , now that radiation levels have decreased in the years since the disaster , despite still being up to 10 times higher than normal levels			1
while the city of @entity22 , which was located just 3 km away from the reactor , remains empty to this day , some people do live in the nearby town of @entity5 , which is about 15 km from the site			1
in fact , there 's even an @entity86 in the zone , which caters to travellers interested in spending even more time in the area			0
and in the nearby village of @entity92 , @entity90 offers accommodations for their overnight tours at the @entity95 , a @entity97 style dwelling located just 5 km from the @entity99 check point			0
@entity90 , a @entity15 - based tour operator , offers multi-day trips that include overnight stays at a cottage about 50 km from the site ' there are no new hotels inside the @entity34 , ' @entity90 director , @entity105 , tells @entity106			1
' although some old ones are cosmetically refurbished a bit			0
' according to @entity23 law , businesses , except ones that are necessary for the zone functioning , are not allowed to be there - there will be no new radisson or @entity117 opening			2
' despite the ban on all non-essential workers from living in the zone , wildlife in the area - including foxes - has been thriving dark tourism , a term first coined in 1996 at @entity125 , is defined as any visit to sites that are traditionally association with death and tragedy			1
however , it is hoped that the main draw is the historical value of such locations , and not their associations with suffering and destruction			0
while all non-essential workers may be banned from living in the zone - and those who do operate on a 15 days on , 15 days off schedule - wildlife in the area is thriving			2
some scientists attribute the proliferation in animal , bird and plant life to the almost 100 per cent absence of humans			0
indeed , in recent years , the area has experienced the reappearance of lynxes , great eagle owls and nesting swans , as well as increased number of deer , foxes and wolves			0
but some studies also claim that the radiation has caused biodiversity to decline and have had long - term health effects on animals in the zone , including the massive catfish that call the plant 's cooling pond home			2
@entity5 is one of the world 's most famous ' dark tourism ' sites and is especially popular among photographers the once affluent town was also home to a funfair , which , following the evacuation , has since been overgrown with weeds the town of @entity22 and its ruins are favoured by photographers because of the @entity179 aesthetic and surrounding area 's untouched nature the @entity181 site , the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since @entity5 , has also recently become a tourist attraction			1
following the 2011 explosion , local @entity186 tour guides have begun escorting buses of people through the area , given that contamination levels are said to be ' low			2
' guides say that they hope by educating tourists and sharing their experiences , people will be inspired to help rebuild the community			0
while there are a number of abandoned villages in and around the zone , most popular site to visit is the ghost town of @entity22 , which offers a breathtaking snapshot of a @entity179 city circa the 1980s			1
the area is of particular interest to photographers , who love capturing the untouched scenery and the stark contrast between the thriving wildlife and the devastating ruins			0
a relatively affluent town prior to the explosion , @entity22 was home to a newly - built amusement park , blocks of apartment complexes , and even a movie theatre			1
the amusement park is the most photographed area , in particular the iconic derelict @entity221 and bumper cars			0
despite government orders to leave , almost 200 people still live within the @entity34			2
these inhabitants are known as ' self - settlers , ' and according to many who have visited the region , it is customary for those who visit to bring them gifts or small donations			2
a private tour booking will cost anywhere between $ 100 ( £ 67 ) to $ 400 ( £ 268 ) , depending on the duration of your stay and amount of people but in order for visitors to legally enter , they must be granted a pass , which is only possible to get through booking a private tour , which will cost anywhere between $ 100 ( £ 67 ) to $ 400 ( £ 268 ) , depending on the duration of your stay and the amount of people in your group			1
' last year , we ran 290 tours and served 1,980 visitors , ' @entity105 adds			0
' in 2014 , there were 5,900 visitors to the zone in total - though usually there are at least 10,000			2
' our one day tour is the most popular because it 's the most affordable , however there are more and more interest for two , three and four day tours			0
' many people who visit once with a group return to have an extended tour			0
