@entity21 @entity20 , where a woman tried to hang hersel by leaping from a 30ft balcony as @entity26 , 40 , lost her grip on her clothing her partner @entity25 , 48 , grabbed hold of her arms but eventually the woman slipped from their grip			1
but by this time security guards had gathered underneath and they caught her , foiling the apparent suicide attempt			1
she had been in court for a committal hearing to the crown court on charges of false imprisonment of @entity42 at her home in @entity45 , @entity46 , and wasting police time			1
sources say the woman must have smuggled the rope into @entity51 , south @entity52 , despite security bag searches on entry			1
the balcony she leapt from is in the court building complex leading to the courts themselves			1
a tearful ms @entity26 said : ' this morning the lady she had whiskers drawn on her face with black pen			1
' we saw her coming up the stairs and she went into the toilet and i said to my partner " this girl here is different "			2
she was very quiet that is all i know			2
' she had a rope and my partner and i were stood along the balcony from her then i saw her tying a rope to the balcony and start to put her leg over			1
' i ran over and i grabbed hold of her by her t - shirt			2
i held her and i held her and the top spilt			2
' ' of the two people who were trying to hold her the female was the main one			2
she did her level best and also you could see it in her face how upset she was when she could n’t hold on to her anymore			2
' barrister @entity86 ms @entity26 had burn marks on her hands from where she desperately tried to cling to the woman			2
mr @entity25 followed his wife to help			2
he said : ' then i managed to grab hold of her arms but she slipped			0
just before she did the security guards had come and stood beneath her an grabbed her legs			0
' she did n’t tie it properly and the rope , which was synthetic and quite thin , snapped as she went down			1
the rope was long , too long i think			1
' ms @entity26 , said : ' i could n’t hold on , but if i had n’t managed to save her then i would have felt so guilty , i could not have lived with myself			1
because we held her it gave them time to come round			0
' ms @entity26 and her partner are due to be sentenced later today for common assault later today			0
barrister @entity86 witnessed the shocking events shortly after 10am this morning			0
he said : ' we were standing literally underneath when we heard a commotion , we heard a noise from the balcony and looked up and saw an @entity111 female and a black man run to the end of the balcony			0
' it was at this point we saw the woman climbing over			0
at this point the couple , predominantly the female , grabbed hold of her , both her arms and clothes as she tried to lower herself down from the balcony			0
' now they both held on to her for as long as they could for what seemed like 10 or 15 seconds by which time the security guards had been alerted to what was going on , a number of security guards had run underneath her by the time the couple either decided to let her go or could n’t hold on to her anymore			0
' she fell into the arms of at least two security guards who brought her down as gently as they could at which point i realised she had a yellow rope tied tightly around her neck and the balcony edge , i could n’t see if it had snapped			1
' when she was brought down a number of police officers became involved and one of the first things i saw was one of them trying to release the rope around her neck			1
' of the two people who were trying to hold her the female was the main one			0
she did her level best and also you could see it in her face how upset she was when she could n’t hold on to her anymore			0
' they should certainly get a commendation , either she would have fallen and if the rope was secure she would have hung herself or if it was unsecured she would have fallen 30 feet on to a marble floor			1
' they certainly should be commended , i do n’t think many would have acted like that , they were very quick thinking , she was literally in the process of climbing over when they grabbed her			0
' we do see some strange things in court but i have been doing this job for more than 20 years and this has upset a lot of people			0
i had seen her just five minutes earlier with black marks on her face			0
' the woman is charged with false imprisonment and wasting police time by falsely reporting a crime on april 3			0
after she was brought to the floor she was held down by officers as she screamed before an ambulance came and took her away .			0
