purchased by husband @entity32 for Â£ 12,000 , the horse finished in a respectable seventh place at @entity43 last year - all the better given that @entity0 initially thought the animal was a dud			1
speaking ahead of last year 's @entity39 , she revealed that her initial response to mr @entity32 's purchase was to call him an ' idiot ' but was later won over			2

today - @entity121 horse : @entity85 @entity122 : 11/10 he 's called faugheen the machine for a reason and it 's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on tuesday , despite the impressive field			0
@entity130 jockey , @entity52 , is yet to decide his mount for the race , with stablemate and dual @entity121 winner @entity134 also lining up , but with fingers pointing towards @entity85 it 's just another reason to back him			0
wednesday - @entity137 horse : dodging bullets @entity122 : 4/1 all eyes might be on @entity140 and @entity141 , but @entity142 has easily had the most impressive route to this year 's @entity4 , and although a short price the @entity145 winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting			1
thursday : ladbrokes world hurdle horse : @entity153 du @entity152 @entity122 : 9/2 @entity155 ' stranglehold at the top of the @entity157 betting has tightened again following @entity159 's withdrawal			0
it 's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite , but with @entity152 back over hurdles it can only be a good thing			0
he gallops and jumps well , and his @entity167 win shows he can do it at @entity4 @entity169 horse : @entity170 @entity122 : 10/1 it 's impossible to not back @entity172 's last ever ride in the @entity173 - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey			2
there 's still doubts whether favourite @entity179 can finally make it third time lucky at @entity4 , but for the old romantics there 's only one man that can win this year 's @entity173 , and it 's @entity172			0
winning ways : former @entity189 boss @entity188 ( second right ) celebrates with his horse @entity85 good work ! @entity52 and @entity193 celebrate after winning the @entity194 last ride : veteran jockey @entity172 arrives at @entity4 for the last time as a rider jam - packed : the sunny weather brought thousands of racing fans flocking to @entity4			2
