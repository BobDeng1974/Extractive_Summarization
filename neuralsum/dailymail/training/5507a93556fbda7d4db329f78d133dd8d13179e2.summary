by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 04:39 est , 17 july 2012 choosing where to spend a precious summer holiday is a fraught process for most families			1
but research out yesterday might make it a bit easier – by naming the destinations that make you put on the most weight			1
it found that the kebabs , tsatziki and chips of @entity13 prove too much for many @entity14			1
@entity16 beaches attract holidaymakers from all over the world			2
but there 's a hidden catch to a sunkissed vacation in @entity22 , @entity13 or @entity23 on a typical ten - day break an adult would add 3.3lb to their waists , whether in the @entity22 or @entity23 parts of the @entity16 island			1
@entity23 came a close second – with holidaymakers putting on 3lb during their stay there – while @entity33 was third with 2.9lb			1
an unhealthy diet of kebabs and chips means tourists typically pile on the pounds the survey placed much of the blame on the all you can eat hotel buffet , which @entity14 cited as the chief reason for filling out			1
the @entity43 , which is known for huge portions of fast food and a growing obesity crisis , was in fourth place			0
in the survey for @entity49 , one in five people said putting on weight had spoilt their break			1
large numbers said food abroad was cheaper and better than back at home , making them want to eat out too often			0
in @entity58 , which came seventh in the poll , ‘ high quality food ’ was said to be the main reason for coming home heavier			0
half of the holidaymakers admitted drinking more alcohol than they would have at home			0
women were much less affected by excess , gaining just 1.5lb on average compared with a hefty 5.5lb for men			0
those who stayed at home to holiday in the @entity14 did not escape without some ‘ extra baggage ’			1
they put on half a pound , according to the survey of 350 holidaymakers			0
a remarkable one in five claimed to have lost weight while on holiday			1
extra exercise was the explanation in 74 per cent of cases			0
some 55 per cent cited hot weather for slimming down , while 38 per cent attributed their success to healthy local food and 16 per cent to the need to fit into beachwear			0
others said that atrocious or over-priced meals had helped them reduce their intake			0
for the women who slimmed down the average weight loss was 2.2lb , while for men it was 7.2lb			2
the three countries where people reported losing weight were @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 – none of which is known for sunshine or great food			2
exercise – strolling the streets of @entity106 or hiking in the @entity107 or in the @entity108 – was cited by respondents as the reason for their weight loss			2
@entity112 , the land of chocolate , waffles and chips , came in at a surprisingly low number ten on the list			2
those who stayed there mainly blamed the country ’s famous beers for the fact they had bulked up .			0
