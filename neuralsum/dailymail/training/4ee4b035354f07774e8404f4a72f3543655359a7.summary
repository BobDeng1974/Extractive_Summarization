a fossil of the largest known platypus has been discovered in @entity2			1
the remains , which are likely to be between 15 and five million years old , indicate that the ancient creature , which is related to the modern platypus , measured almost a metre in length			1
until recently , the fossil record indicated that the platypus lineage was unique , with only one species inhabiting the @entity11 at any one time			1
@entity13 ( reconstruction illustrated ) was a giant toothed platypus from the the @entity17 fossil deposits of @entity18 , @entity2			1
at about one metre in length and with powerful teeth ( inset : the holotype , a first lower molar ) , it would have been capable of killing much larger prey , such as lungfish however , the discovery of the fossil casts doubt on the theory as the new , giant species of extinct playtypus was a side - branch of the platypus family tree , scientists said			1
the new platypus species , named @entity13 , is based on a single tooth from the famous @entity18 of northwest @entity38			1
while many of @entity18 's fossil deposits are now being radiometrically dated , the precise age of the particular deposit that produced the tooth of the giant platypus is in doubt			1
however , it is likely to be between 15 and 5 million years old , according to the study in the @entity48			1
' @entity50 ( platypuses and echidnas ) are the last remnant of an ancient radiation of mammals unique to the southern continents , ' said phd candidate @entity56 , lead author of the study , which was conducted at the @entity58			1
' a new platypus species , even one that is highly incomplete , is a very important aid in developing understanding about these fascinating mammals , ' she said			2
based on the size of fossilised tooth , it is estimated that this extinct species would have been nearly a metre long , which is approximately twice the size of the modern platypus			1
the fossilised tooth was discovered in the richly fossiliferous freshwater limestones in the @entity18 ( pictured ) in northwest @entity38 no living mammal is more peculiar than the platypus			1
when it was discovered by @entity77 explorers in 1798 , many believed sketches of the animal were a hoax because it seemed to share characteristics of totally unrelated animals			0
it has a broad , duck - like bill , thick , otter - like fur , and webbed , beaver - like feet			0
a platypus ' snout is also covered with electroreceptors that help it detect underwater prey			0
modern platypus do not have teeth like their newly discovered ancestor , and resort to using gravel to ' chew ' their crustaceans , larvae and worms			2
unlike other mammals , the platypus lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young			0
male platypus have a venomous spur on their hind foot			0
researchers said the bumps and ridges on the animal 's teeth also provide clues about what the species ate			2
dr @entity116 , a co-author of the study also at the university , said : ' like other platypuses , it was probably a mostly aquatic mammal , and would have lived in and around the freshwater pools in the forests that covered the @entity18 area millions of years ago			2
' ' @entity13 was a very large platypus with well - developed teeth and we think it probably fed not only on crayfish and other freshwater crustaceans , but also on small vertebrates including the lungfish , frogs , and small turtles that are preserved with it in the @entity137 fossil deposit			1
' the oldest platypus fossils come from 61 million - year - old rocks in southern @entity140			2
younger platypus fossils are known from @entity2 in what is now the @entity143 , but before the discovery of @entity13 , these fossils suggested that platypuses became smaller and reduced the size of their teeth through time			2
the modern platypus completely lacks teeth as an adult and instead has pads with tiny horns on , in its mouth			0
the name @entity157 comes from the @entity158 for ' lasting tooth ' and was coined to distinguish extinct toothed platypuses from the essentially toothless modern species			2
the modern platypus ( pictured ) is approximatley twice as small as its ancient relative			0
the living mammal has a broad , duck - like bill , thick , otter - like fur , and webbed , beaver - like feet dr @entity167 , another co-author of the study by the @entity58 , said : ' discovery of this new species was a shock to us because prior to this , the fossil record suggested that the evolutionary tree of platypuses was relatively linear one			1
' now we realise that there were unanticipated side branches on this tree , some of which became gigantic			0
' the specific epithet of the new species , tharalkooschild , honours an @entity187 creation story about the origin of the platypus			0
in the @entity191 , @entity190 was a head - strong girl duck inclined to disobey her parents			0
her parents warned her not to swim downriver because @entity195 the water - rat would have his wicked way with her			0
scoffing , she disobeyed her parents and was ravished by @entity195			0
by the time @entity190 escaped and returned to her family , the other girl ducks were laying eggs , so she did the same			0
but instead of a fluffy little duckling emerging from her egg , her child was an amazing chimera that had the bill , webbed hind feet , and egg - laying habit of a duck , along with the fur and front feet of a rodent - the first @entity211 .			0

the fossilised tooth was discovered in the @entity18 of @entity38 and is thought to be between five and 15 million years old
researchers from the @entity58 said the creature probably fed on small vertebrates such as lungfish , frogs , and small turtles
until recently , the fossil record indicated that the platypus lineage was unique , with only one species inhabiting the @entity11 at any one time
