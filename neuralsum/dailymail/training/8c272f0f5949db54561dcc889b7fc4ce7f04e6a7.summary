by @entity0 published : 16:16 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 13 february 2013 a high court judge yesterday blamed ‘ modular ’ exams brought in by @entity3 for a fiasco over gcse grades			1
lord @entity6 made his comments as he rejected a bid by school leaders , teaching unions and councils to have thousands of @entity13 results regraded			1
they had argued it was ‘ illegitimate grade manipulation ’ and ‘ a statistical fix ’ by the @entity18 and @entity19 exam boards as they had pushed up grade boundaries			2
after the gsce grading fiasco : education secretary @entity22 is currently overhauling the structural reforms that @entity3 made to gcses in 2009 - changes that were judged today as being inherently unfair but , while he agreed that some students had been treated unfairly , the judge said the fault lay with the qualification			1
the case centered on an estimated 10,000 pupils who sat the exams last june but missed out on a c , the minimum normally needed to go into further education			1
the alliance wanted their results to be regraded in line with those from january 2012 , when the boundaries were lower			2
@entity3 brought in bite - sized gcse units in 2009 which could be taken repeatedly			1
but in 2010 education secretary @entity22 announced they would go			1
after yesterday ’s judgement , he demanded that @entity3 apologise to pupils			1
lord justice @entity6 said : ‘ i am satisfied that it was indeed the structure of the qualification itself which is the source of such unfairness as has been demonstrated in this case			0
’ @entity49 changes under @entity3 : a @entity51 spokesman said the dispute over 2012 results showed the gcse system has been in need of fundamental reform since 2009 following the judgment , education secretary @entity22 demanded that @entity3 politicians apologised to pupils , parents and teachers for the fiasco			1
mr @entity22 - who announced the removal of modules from gcses in the 2010 schools @entity66 - said : ‘ today ’s judgement made it clear that the modular structure created the problem with gcses			1
‘ we took action to clear up the mess caused by @entity3			1
’ the judges were told at a hearing in december that an estimated 10,000 pupils who sat @entity13 exams last june missed out on a c grade - the minimum grade normally needed to go into further education			2
the group of school leaders , teachers and pupils said that the exam boards were to blame because they pushed up the grade boundaries - effectively ‘ moving the goalposts ’ for pupils			0
it said this amounted to ‘ illegitimate grade manipulation ’ and ‘ a statistical fix ’ involving exams regulator @entity94			0
@entity97 , appearing for the alliance , claimed students had been unjustifiably ‘ clobbered ’ to meet the @entity94 requirement of no apparent grade inflation			0
but in the conclusion to his judgment , @entity101 , sitting with mrs @entity104 at @entity106 ’s @entity105 , said : ‘ the problem lies with the modular nature of the examination , coupled with the fact that grade boundaries were assessed and made public at each stage of the process			0
@entity22 said that he was cleaning up @entity3 's mess after they broke up @entity49 into ' bitesize ' modules that could be retaken repeatedly as part of his wider education reforms ‘ mr @entity120 was highly critical of this structure			1
he rightly points out that a high number of experts had predicted precisely the kind of difficulties which have , in fact , arisen			0
’ he added : ‘ i am satisfied that it was indeed the structure of the qualification itself which is the source of such unfairness as has been demonstrated in this case , and not any unlawful action by either @entity94 or the @entity132 ( exam boards )			0
’ he dismissed the alliance ’s application for a judicial review , but said the issue had caused an outcry and was a ‘ matter of widespread and genuine concern properly brought to court ’			0
lawyers for the alliance had argued for the june exams to be regraded in line with those taken in january when the boundaries were lower			0
but @entity19 and @entity18 said they had behaved properly and @entity94 argued it had acted in a ‘ clear , principled and transparent way ’			0
the @entity150 yesterday described the ruling as ‘ very disappointing ’ but said the judge had recognised that pupils had been treated ‘ unfairly ’			0
a spokesman for the @entity18 exam board said the ruling ‘ confirmed that we set the right grade boundaries for gcse @entity13 last summer ’			2
he added : ‘ in the judges ’ view , the main reason schools did not get the results they expected was the modular structure of the qualification			0
’ a @entity51 spokesman said the dispute showed the gcse system has been in need of fundamental reform			2
balls up : @entity170 , left , was education secretary when @entity3 changed the gcse structure in 2009			1
the present conservative education secretary @entity22 , right , has insisted balls apologise for the ' unfair ' reforms he said : ‘ we are now making further reforms to gcses , including overhauling league tables so they are fair to schools and pupils , and still give parents and the public the information they need			1
‘ the judgement demonstrates that overall @entity94 got it right last year			0
’ the government in @entity188 has already intervened to re-grade some gcse @entity13 results			2
in a report last november , @entity94 concluded that january ’s gcse @entity13 assessments , which accounted for about 10 per cent of entries , had been ‘ graded generously ’			2
however , the june boundaries had been properly set and candidates ’ work had been accurately graded .			0

a bid to have thousands of gcse grades remarked has been turned down
@entity3 's structural changes to gcses in 2009 are now judged ' unfair '
@entity22 , the present conservative education secretary , demanded an apology from @entity3 for their *botched* reforms
