’ @entity114 , mp for @entity115 , said : ‘ the free movement of people is no longer working in the interests of this nation , so why do @entity120 lack the political will to change the law ? ’ @entity124 president @entity123 said mr @entity1 had called him earlier this week ‘ informing me about the intentions he has on these issues of freedom of movement ’			0
‘ i had the occasion to underline to prime minister @entity1 that free movement is a fundamental treaty principle that must be upheld , ’ he added			0

@entity124 can only comment in detail when we receive legislative proposals brought forward by the @entity18			0
threat : the @entity10 government claims the ' social dumping ' of people from poor @entity20 states is a threat to the ' social fabric of @entity10 ' ‘ the principle of free movement is one of the most valued principles by the @entity39 citizens			0
there is clear evidence of its economic benefits but we are also aware of the challenges that this can also bring , particularly for local communities and services and @entity39 rules already include measures to prevent abuse			0
’ mrs may told @entity21 the measures would lead to conflict with @entity5 , which is already taking @entity18 to court over an existing ‘ right to reside ’ test applied to determine migrants ’ right to welfare			1
mr @entity1 questioned the principle of free movement of people across the @entity39 , saying this right could not be ‘ unqualified ’			2
‘ yes , of course , there is a right to take up a specific position if you want to work but there should not be a freedom of movement to claim , ’ the prime minister added			0
controls were ‘ not just aimed at @entity28 and @entity29 ’ but would apply to ‘ anyone in other @entity39 countries thinking of coming to @entity18 because it is easier to claim benefits ’			1

new rules : @entity10 government ministers have outlined plans to limit the rights of temporary workers from other countries mr @entity1 suggested a future @entity99 government , as part of its pledge to renegotiate @entity39 membership , would propose changes to allow member states to halt arrivals if numbers exceeded a fixed level			1
he also suggested freedom of movement should only be fully allowed if the average income of a country ’s people was not too far below the @entity39 average			0
the @entity210 have supported the clampdown on migrants ’ benefit rights , but say they would not back the longer - term reform of freedom of movement rules			1
@entity218 mayor @entity217 suggested fundamental reform was needed			0
