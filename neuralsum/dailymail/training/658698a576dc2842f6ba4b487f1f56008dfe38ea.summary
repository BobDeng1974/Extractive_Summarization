by @entity0 published : 03:50 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 04:10 est , 7 september 2012 they say a pot of gold lies at the end of every rainbow - but finding a hoard of 200 - year - old silver in a pile of rubbish has got to be almost as unlikely			2
that 's exactly what lucky gardener @entity10 did when he decided to clear up litter dumped near his allotment in @entity14			2
while he was removing the plastic bags the bottom fell out of one to reveal a collection of high quality @entity19 silverware worth hundreds of pounds			1
@entity21 : gardener @entity10 could not believe his luck when he found this stash of beautiful silverware in a bag of rubbish sparkling : the collection included an assortment of decorative dinnerware the haul included a 48 - piece dinner service of dessert spoons , dessert forks , table forks , and serving spoons , as well as grape scissors , a mustard spoon a pearl - handled button hook and solid silver shoe horn			1
honest mr @entity10 , of @entity41 , @entity14 , handed it all in to police as lost property back in march but it went unclaimed			1
he decided to auction the collection off , and split the proceeds between two charities - the @entity47 and @entity48 , in @entity49 , where he and wife @entity51 often holiday			0
' as i picked up one of the bags the bottom fell out and what i had assumed to be a bag full of rubbish turned out to be a carrier bag full of @entity19 silver , ” said @entity10 , a @entity61			1
' i was of course amazed to think that these beautiful pieces of silver had been lying forgotten in a field and i took them all immediately to the police station			1
' it was the summer we had in march and i was working in the field and there was just polystyrene and chip wrappers lying about			0
' i thought while it was nice it ’s a shame for it to make a mess , so i thought i ’ll just tidy the place up a little bit			0
i picked up this carrier bag and it burst and all this silver fell out			2
' honest : mr @entity10 took the hoard to the police in case the owner came forward - but was eventually given it back			1
among the items found was a silver shoehorn ( pictured ) mr @entity10 continued to try to find the owner of the silver after nobody came forward to claim it from the police			1
' i carried on making inquiries on the internet and on our local radio and in our local newspaper , but still no one seemed to know anything about the silver , ' he said			0
' i decided then to do something worthwhile with my find and took the whole lot of silver to be auctioned at our local auctioneers fiddler and @entity105			2
' mr @entity10 said the auctioneers were so impressed with his story that they did not charge any commission			0
generous : he eventually auctioned off the collection and donated the money to charity			1
here mr @entity10 ( left , holding the cheque ) and his wife @entity51 ( far left ) hand over a cheque for £ 400 to @entity48 the items were sold off to collectors in different lots and the silver eventually made £ 530 at auction , with donations bringing the total up to £ 800			0
' my wife @entity51 and i love coming to @entity48 on holiday so we decided to donate half the amount - £ 400 - to @entity48 and the other £ 400 to our home @entity47 of @entity14 , @entity127 and @entity128 , ' said mr @entity10			0
' we are very pleased that this unexpected find will benefit some very worthwhile causes and we would also like to thank everyone who made a donation			0
' @entity133 , operations manager of @entity48 , said : ' [ we ] are especially pleased that @entity10 and @entity134 wanted to give something to @entity48 with the proceeds from this very unexpected find and we are very grateful to them			0
