the sci - fi cyborgs were in the capital for business , rather than pleasure , as @entity11 crews filmed scenes for a one - off special to celebrate the 50th anniversary of @entity4			1
the programme , called @entity15 in @entity16 , is a dramatisation of the how the cult series was created			0
an army of daleks could be seen crossing @entity5 during the filming of the @entity4 special taxi ! daleks could be seen along @entity5 during the filing of an adventure in @entity25 and @entity26 filming for the drama , which is set in the 1960s , began earlier this month			1
it will air later this year on @entity30			1
today 's filming sought to recreate scenes from the second episode of series two of @entity4 , entitled @entity35 , filmed in 1964 where the daleks stormed through @entity37			1
the @entity4 special , an adventure in @entity16 , marks the 50th anniversary of the cult show taxi ! daleks could be seen along @entity5 during the filing of an adventure in @entity25 and @entity26 photos of the episode 's ‘ invasion ’ became instantly popular in 1964 and over the years images of those scenes have been referenced and updated on several occasions			1
today 's filming was the first time that a production team had attempted to faithfully replicate the 1964 shoot using @entity41 that were unique to that single adventure			0
the forthcoming drama based on @entity4 has been scripted by @entity55 , who co-wrote the script for @entity57			2
it will star @entity59 as @entity60 who was the first actor to ever play the role of the doctor			2
@entity63 will play the role of @entity65 , the former head of drama at the @entity11 who was the driving force behind the creation of the show			0
@entity55 said : ' this is the story of how an unlikely set of brilliant people created a true television original			0
' and how an actor – @entity60 – stereotyped in hard - man roles became a hero to millions of children			0
' i 've wanted to tell this story this for more years than i can remember			0
to make it happen for @entity4 's 50th birthday is quite simply a dream come true			2
