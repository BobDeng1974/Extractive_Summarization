a @entity1 dealer in @entity2 has faced serious backlash on social media after it printed an advertisement which made a joke about a convicted sex offender			1
' there 's more hope of @entity10 getting a babysitting gig than us finding a better example ' , the ad read , underneath an image of a white @entity17 utility			0
the description then went on to boast features of the vehicle such as it being a 4x4 diesel engine with a steel tray with a price of $ 28,990			0
the ad originally appeared in local paper the @entity26 earlier this month , but got a second wind on social media over the weekend when the image resurfaced			1
this advertisement ran in the @entity26 , a local @entity31 newspaper but resurfaced on social media at the weekend causing outrage earlier this month 84 - year - old @entity10 was sentenced to five years and nine months behind bars in the @entity35 for 12 sexual assaults			1
according to social media users on @entity43 and @entity44 the reference to the @entity31 entertainer , who abused his daughter 's best friend from the age of 13 , was in extremely poor taste			1
one person tweeted ' this is not ok ' , while another had nothing more to say than other than a simple ' oh dear			0
' according to the @entity52 , the offending advertisement was for @entity1 in @entity53 , @entity2			1
the joke referenced @entity10 , who has just been jailed in the @entity35 on 12 sex offence charges general sales manager of the dealership @entity59 told the publication the advertisement was not intended to offend anyone and was removed off their website soon after publication			2
' we try to make our ads a little bit interesting and a little bit lighthearted but we blurred the lines of good taste and bad on this occasion , ' mr @entity59 said			0
but the advertisement took on a life of it 's own despite only being printed in one edition of the newspaper , with people calling out @entity77 over the inappropriate reference			2
@entity77 responded to questions on @entity44 saying ' we do n't endorse the ad and requested for it to be removed			0
now working with dealer to ensure it does nâ€™t happen again			0
