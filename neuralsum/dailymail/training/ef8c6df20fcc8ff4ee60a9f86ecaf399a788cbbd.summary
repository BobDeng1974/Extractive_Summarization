millions of commuters faced chaotic scenes getting to work this morning - with more than half of @entity4 buses not running because of strike action			1
passengers were hit with significant disruption and delays amid snowy conditions after a walkout by members of the @entity13 union over pay differences between the capital 's 18 bus companies			1
@entity17 ( @entity17 ) , which said about 47 per cent of routes were running , called the strike ' totally unnecessary ' and pointed out that only 16 per cent of drivers voted for action			1
the vast majority of routes are affected in some way , with only around 40 across the capital running as normal , meaning that the @entity26 and train network in the capital had to cope with millions of extra journeys			2
pictured are commuters cramming into victoria station hundreds of passengers took to @entity42 to express frustration at the timing of the strike as snow fell during the disrupted morning commute			2
@entity54 , @entity17 's director of buses , said : ' i am very sorry that the leadership of @entity13 is intent on disrupting the journeys of @entity4 's 6.5 million daily bus passengers , especially given that only 16 per cent of bus drivers voted for strike action			1
' bus driver rates of pay have been negotiated and agreed between @entity13 and the bus companies individually under a long - standing and jointly agreed process			1
this has regularly resulted in pay rises above the rate of inflation			0
' as in all professions , bus drivers have different levels of experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay			2
a ' levelling up ' of pay to the highest rates would result in higher fares and cuts to bus services for passengers and fewer jobs for bus drivers			1

unite regional officer @entity119 said : ' @entity17 is being wildly optimistic with its claims of the number of buses running today			1
once again we 've seen solid support by bus workers determined to end the pay chaos on @entity4 's buses			1
' today 's disruption is regrettable , but the blame lies squarely with @entity4 's 18 bus companies who have continued to refuse to talk collectively over the last two years			1
' to suggest such talks would be illegal is misleading			0
are they saying that collective arrangements covering the construction industry or the police are illegal ? ' all we are asking for is a collective forum to discuss how we can end pay disparities over a sensible timeframe			0
' the bus companies need to stop hiding behind the coat tails of @entity17 and start talking collectively about how we end pay inequality and achieve a fair deal for the men and women who keep @entity4 on the move seven days a week , 24 hours a day			1
' picket lines were mounted outside bus depots across the capital and there are further strikes planned for later in the mont this comes after a bus strike on january 13 over the alleged ' continued refusal by @entity4 's 18 bus operators ' to enter into talks about workers ' pay , terms and conditions which saw two - thirds of buses in @entity4 not running			1

that 's our biggest bugbear			0
' that 's just wrong because you are all out there doing the same job			0
' he said all drivers used to do a six - month probation period and then move on to the top rate of pay after a year			2
