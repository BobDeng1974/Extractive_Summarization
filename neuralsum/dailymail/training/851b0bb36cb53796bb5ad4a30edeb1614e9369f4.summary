film companies and record labels will not be able to force mash - ups and spoofs to be taken down from the internet under a major shake - up of copyright law			1
ministers have vowed to legalise parodies after countless viral hits have disappeared from sites like @entity10 because multi-national firms failed to see the funny side			2
it also means the creators of hits like the countless parodies of the @entity18 film @entity17 , @entity20 's mash - ups of tv shows and the genius behind the @entity23 ( buttery biscuit base ) will no longer be breaking the law by copying and editing popular tv shows			1
the government argues 300 - year - old laws have failed to keep pace with online technology , which makes it easy for anyone with a computer to create smash hit videos online			2
it means internet successes will no longer be killed off by complaints by global entertainment giants			0
last year a @entity58 spoof of an advert for @entity60 was pulled after a complaint from the car firm			0
it complained about the manufacturer 's commitment to being green			0
mash - up creators like @entity20 have long run the risk of breaching copyright laws by editing clips from tv shows like the @entity71 and documentaries by @entity73 to comic effect			1
this summer mr @entity40 became an internet sensation after filming an apology for breaking his promise to vote against a rise in tuition fees			0
@entity82 from comedy website @entity80 re-edited it to music , so it sounded like the deputy prime minister was singing his regret to voters			0
after securing permission from mr @entity40 , the song was released as a single ahead of the @entity38 annual conference - but only reached 143 in the official charts			1
video : @entity23 mash - up has been watched 5.8million times mr @entity37 , the business secretary , told mps : ' the creative industries sector , which is crucial to the economy , depends heavily on intellectual property rights			2
' however , we are dealing with a body of law that is extremely old - i believe that it goes back to @entity107			1
it certainly needs modification in the digital age			0
' the new rules on ‘ parody , caricature and pastiche ’ set out by the government will ‘ allow limited copying on a fair dealing basis which would allow genuine parody , but prohibit copying disguised as parody ’			0
the changes to copyright laws will also mean music users who copy cds to ipods and laptops will no longer be treated as criminals			1
ministers will scrap the law which means it is technically illegal for someone to copy a cd or ebook on to an @entity132 or @entity133			1
most of the millions of people using mobile music devices have no idea they are unwittingly breaking the law every time they move a song from one device to another			1
six years ago , the @entity143 said it would not seek to punish people , provided they were only copying tracks for their personal use			2
users will be able to copy music and ebooks between devices without breaking the law under the shake - up of copyright but only now have the government agreed to change the law to keep pace with technology , which sees people regularly swapping and copying files between devices and software like @entity160			1
the change means users will be able to copy files as many times as they like for their own use , but it will still be illegal to give copies to other people			1
the government has also ruled out imposing an ‘ @entity170 ’ on all music storage devices , despite being levied across much of @entity171			0
mr @entity37 has refused to follow other @entity173 countries that have imposed a copyright levy – dubbed an ‘ @entity175 ’ - on any technology that can copy , including ipods , computers and photocopiers			1
for example , in @entity180 , a @entity132 is hit with an @entity170 of 15 euros			2
in @entity183 the charge is added to anything which can be used to make a copy , including blank paper			2
it puts @entity188 at loggerheads with @entity190 , where @entity173 officials are drawing up plans for a @entity171 - wide @entity170 , due to be announced within weeks			0
mr @entity37 is refusing to back the idea of an @entity173 levy set centrally by @entity190			0
a raft of changes will make it easier for people to use work covered by copyright without getting permission from the copyright owners			1
teachers will be able to use more material on interactive whiteboards and share files across secure networks for students			0
sound recordings , films and broadcasts can also be copied for non-commercial research and private study purposes			0
under existing legislation a breach of copyright can be punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine of £ 5,000 .			0

copyright law shake - up to make it easier to transfer files between devices
@entity132 and *e-book* users will not be criminalised if copy is for personal use
record companies will not be able to block song parodies
