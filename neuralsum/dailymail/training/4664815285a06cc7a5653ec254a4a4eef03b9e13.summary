so the @entity0 have finally done what the @entity2 intelligence services , police , courts and successive governments failed to do in 15 years — they ’ve incarcerated @entity7 for good			1
you can draw a direct line from @entity2 ’s failure to act in the @entity11 , when he first came to the attention of the authorities , through to 52 deaths and more than 700 injuries in the @entity18 bombings in 2005			1
in addition , hundreds of young @entity2 @entity19 have been lured to their deaths in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 by the warped , poisonous rhetoric of @entity7 and others , who used @entity18 as a safe haven in which to preach , recruit and raise money			1
our security services appeared neither sharp enough to see what was going on nor willing to share what little they did glean			0
why on earth did n’t the police and intelligence agents simply open their ears and eyes to what was happening all over this country ? they could have attended @entity7 ’s public meetings , bought his audio cassettes from @entity19 bookshops , spoken to worried families of his followers and listened to the warnings of intelligence services in @entity61 and @entity0			1
how do i know ? because that ’s what i did			0
as an investigative reporter , i ’ve tracked @entity7 ’s ‘ career ’ since the late nineties			1
yesterday , political and legal figures were defending their failure to get an earlier result			2
for example , @entity71 , attorney general from 2001 to 2007 , said it did n’t matter whether @entity7 had been convicted in @entity33 or @entity18			1
finally : the hook - handed father - of - eight , formerly the imam of @entity75 in @entity18 , fought extradition to the @entity0 for eight years but how many lives would have been saved — how many families spared the anguish of bereavement — if our government had acted more decisively ? it will remain a damning indictment of the police , politicians and the judicial authorities that they did not react sooner			1
even as far back as 1998 , when i filmed @entity7 spouting his rhetoric at an ‘ @entity91 ’ in @entity18 , it was clear this man was radicalising potential terrorists and should have been arrested or deported			1
that meeting took place , ironically , in the @entity96 owned by the @entity98 movement , which is committed to peace and inclusive faith			0
however , not much of either was on show that night			0
the extremist cleric felt secure enough to unveil a plan ‘ to make the skies very high risk for anyone who flies ’			0
his bizarre scheme — three years before terrorists hijacked planes on 9/11 — involved giant floating nets , mined with explosives , which , somehow , would entangle passing planes			0
the 500 - strong audience cheered wildly and shouted ‘ @entity116 ’ — ( @entity114 is @entity115 )			0
@entity117 welcomed the fact that the hate - preacher had finally been brought to justice then he urged his followers to devise other similar schemes , before showing gruesome videos of rebel ‘ martyrs ’ in @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
the same torrent of hatred came through in his speeches , which were available on cassette from bookshops in towns such as @entity135 and @entity136			0
in one inflammatory speech , the audience was told : ‘ get training , it ’s so you can get the infidel and crush his head in your arms , wring his throat , whip his intestines out			0
‘ forget wasting a bullet on them , cut them in half			0
if you can put a balaclava on your face and walk down the road and stick one in someone , then do it			0
as long as you ’re going to get away with it			0
’ for several years , intelligence contacts in @entity61 told me they were furious at the @entity160 ’s lack of action against @entity7			1
although they knew that our security services had paid informers inside @entity75 mosque , in @entity18 , which @entity7 had turned into his own personal fiefdom , the information gathered was n’t passed to @entity168 , let alone shared with other countries ’ intelligence services			1
this was a crucial failure , because by the late - nineties , extremist @entity19 had become a global phenomenon			1
cities such as @entity18 , @entity177 and @entity33 were all at risk from terrorism			1
controversial : @entity7 delivered sermons outside @entity75 mosque during the 1990s yet @entity18 was allowed to become a base for international terrorism — with @entity184 followers living in suburbs right across the capital			1
among these was a @entity188 who was @entity190 ’s ‘ representative ’ and the leader of an @entity193 terror group that was responsible for horrific atrocities in that country but which was allowed to operate in @entity2 unhindered			1
radical cleric @entity199 ’s extremist @entity197 movement , which was banned in several @entity201 countries and which stirred up violence on many @entity2 campuses , was also based in @entity18 until eventually outlawed in 2010			1
meanwhile , firebrand @entity204 was allowed to remain in @entity2 — despite ten years of protracted legal hearings — until finally being deported back to his native @entity206 last summer			1
in the official report into the @entity18 bombings of july 2005 , the police admitted ‘ they ’d been working to the wrong script ’ , unaware of the dangers of home - grown terrorism			2
shortly after those attacks , i interviewed @entity216 , who had been political director at the @entity217 in the mid-nineties			0
she said that an increasing number of other countries ’ governments had complained to @entity2 about people they considered dangerous who had been allowed to live in @entity18			1
she said : ‘ we ’d say to the @entity227 : “ this is becoming a bit bumpy			0
” i think the @entity227 view was : “ well , they ’re not breaking the law and we ca n’t send them home because they ’d be in jeopardy			0
” in effect , they were n’t willing to act to curb them			0
’ not surprisingly , the @entity0 government was furious			0
three years earlier , i met @entity237 officials , desperate to prosecute @entity7 in the @entity0 they could n’t understand why our government had n’t done so , despite clear links between him and @entity2 citizens who had been killed in terrorist attacks			1
specifically , this referred to an incident in 1999 , when a group of @entity7 ’s followers , including his son and stepson , were arrested in @entity248			2
their @entity248 associates took a group of 16 foreign tourists in reprisal			0
the gang leader ’s official spokesman was @entity7			2
he was aware of what was happening — the result of which was a botched @entity248 rescue operation which led to a shoot - out in which three @entity2 tourists died			2
@entity262 : @entity7 's bile - filled sermons in the 1990s went unpunished ‘ why is @entity7 still walking your streets ? ’ an @entity237 agent asked me			2
on his suggestion , i looked at court files in @entity270 which revealed how utterly inept the @entity2 police operation had been			2
there , i found a memo from @entity168 officers at @entity275			0
although not public knowledge in the @entity2 , it was freely available in @entity0			2
it described how , in 2001 , just before 9/11 , a known associate of @entity7 ’s called @entity280 was stopped while attempting to travel to @entity22 with cash and computer equipment			1
@entity283 claimed it was for a girls ’ educational charity			0
could this really be true at a time when @entity22 was controlled by the @entity289 , who refused to allow girls to be educated ? the @entity237 agent later testified that @entity2 security contacts told him they were convinced that the money and equipment came from @entity7 and was being sent to fund the @entity289			1
so , why was @entity7 ’s courier not arrested — and @entity7 himself questioned ? instead , the memo in @entity270 reveals that ‘ all efforts ’ were made to help @entity283 continue his journey			2
it was only the following year when @entity7 ’s courier made another trip , this time to the @entity0 — but again on the radical cleric ’s behalf — where he hoped to find a suitably remote site for a training camp , that he was arrested			2
of course , this arrest was made by the now very impatient @entity0			0
in return for a reduced jail sentence , @entity283 testified against @entity7			2
another of @entity7 ’s @entity2 followers , @entity309 , who was arrested and admitted plotting to blow up a passenger plane in mid-air with a bomb hidden in his shoe , also gave evidence against him			1
along with emotional testimony from a survivor of the @entity248 shoot - out , it was enough to convict @entity7			2
now , the cleric is facing life imprisonment			0
and it was all the result of evidence that could have been available to the @entity2 authorities			1
the @entity0 prosecutor referred to @entity7 as ‘ hiding in plain sight ’ in @entity18			1
it is said that ‘ justice is blind ’ — a metaphor meaning the law is impartial , oblivious to race or religion			0
but from what i ’ve seen , it ’s a literal description of @entity2 ’s response to @entity7			1
@entity336 is an award - winning investigative journalist .			0

@entity7 used @entity18 as a ' safe haven ' in which to use ' poisonous rhetoric '
@entity2 showed ' failure to act ' in the late nineties when he came to attention of authorities
