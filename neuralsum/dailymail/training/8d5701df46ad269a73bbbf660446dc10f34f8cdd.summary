a former inmate of @entity1 has told of how he was baptised by @entity3 drug smuggler @entity2 who helped him kick his 20 - year drug addiction , and called on the @entity6 government to show the @entity8 mercy			1
when @entity9 first spoke to @entity2 in prison in 2011 he mocked him for his religious beliefs			1
the pair knew of each other from the previous three times @entity9 had been ordered to serve time but had never spoken			2
' [ the first time we spoke ] we had a debate about philosophy and @entity23 , ' @entity9 told @entity29			1
' at that time , i mocked him because i said that " the @entity32 foundation is a really silly thing to believe			0
how do you as a @entity32 believe in someone who died on the cross and could n't save his own ass and you expect him to save your ass ? " ' @entity9 said @entity2 did not get offended by this exchange and just smiled at him			1
after the first conversation , they continued their debates about religion , philosophy and history , which the @entity8 ' knows a lot about '			0
' one day he came to me and said " you ca n't fit @entity22 in your brain man , no matter how big your brain is , you can not fit @entity22 in your brain because @entity22 is in your heart , so you have to fit @entity22 in your heart " , ' @entity9 said			1
' he said that to me ... at that time i had addiction to drugs inside prison still [ to heroin ]			2
' during that period , he gave me a @entity58 but i just threw it away and again @entity2 never got offended			2
' after @entity9 was baptised , he and @entity2 ( second left ) started up a bible study group inside @entity1 prison the group was one of many programs @entity2 and his fellow @entity3 inmate , @entity64 , pioneered to help rehabilitate ' hundreds ' of prisoners it was not until @entity67 personally witnessed @entity2 's devotion to @entity22 that he started to believe in @entity23			1
' a spiritual encounter happened during that period [ when @entity9 was still addicted to drugs ] , one of them was when @entity2 helped me get through my addiction so he laid down and prayed on me and then he did it constantly , ' @entity9 said			1
' @entity2 did n't intend to ask me to stop drugs at that time but how he approached me was helping [ me to be ] free from my addiction			2
' i had my addiction for 20 years and that 's when i stopped and i realised that he taught me a lot about @entity23			1
i made the decision to be baptised in prison , so @entity2 baptised me			2
' after @entity9 was baptised , he and @entity81 started up a bible study group inside @entity1			1
according to the @entity6 , this is one of many programs @entity2 and his fellow @entity3 inmate , @entity64 , have pioneered to help rehabilitate ' hundreds ' of prisoners			1
@entity9 left prison in 2013 and has now started to preach at churches in south - east @entity89 , while trying to roll out rehabilitation programs started by the @entity8 to help others at 17 different prisons around @entity6			1

as part of his role as an evangelist , @entity9 visits @entity109 - also known as @entity110 - where @entity2 and @entity64 are expected to meet their fate and says the prisons are surrounded by jungle with 19 tigers prowling the grounds			1
just hours before @entity9 spoke with @entity29 , news emerged the executions of @entity2 and @entity94 , who were meant to moved to @entity109 this week to be shot dead , were postponed			1
the former inmate is very vocal about how he feels about the death penalty in @entity6			2
' the maximum sentence is actually written in our system to give impact so people can change themselves , so people can rehabilitate themselves , ' @entity9 said			1
' now we have two living monuments [ @entity2 and @entity64 ] who can make a testimony of how people can change themselves inside prison but then the government is going to shoot them anyway			1
' @entity9 also pointed to a piece of draft legislation that would see those sentenced to death have their penalty reduced if they showed 10 years of good behaviour			2
' why do n't we wait for that to become the law			0
we 're not running out of time to give life , ' he said			0
' it 's unfair , not only about them , but for everyone			0
the government should really open dialogue [ about the death penalty ] to give people a chance to live			0
' the external view of @entity6 's prison on @entity109 , @entity6 @entity8 death - row prisoners @entity94 ( right ) and @entity2 ( left ) @entity9 said he had witnessed @entity2 and @entity64 change people 's lives in prison and they deserved to be spared			1
' these guys have love and compassion and a genuine heart			0
my life before i had seen so many lies , i 've seen all the people speak the other way around with their behaviour , ' he said			0
' they do a good thing in their right hand but bad thing in their left hand			0
[ @entity2 and @entity64 's ] message is simple - love and compassion			1
they never judge other people			0
' when asked how the pair are dealing with their impending deaths , @entity9 said they were ' not even sad ' about it			2
' they really surrender everything to the @entity188 , whatever happens , happens , ' he said			0
' [ @entity2 ] never said there 's nothing we can do but he knew everything has a reason for the @entity188 and how we respond [ to it is up to us ]			2
' these boys responded very well , they give love and compassion			0
why do n't we give a chance for them ? ' @entity2 jokes about [ his last rites ]			0
he says i have the right to live in @entity101			0
we never talk about how are you preparing for death			0
' the boys they 're strong			0
if it was us , we 'd get very emotional like me and the family , i 'm very emotional			0
i say this is an injustice and it 's unfair			0
