by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 of @entity3 may have come under fire for all three of her kitchen refurbishments , but it seems that she 'll be putting her up - to - the - minute appliances to good use			2
tv chef @entity10 has revealed that @entity11 has been brushing up on her culinary skills at @entity14 's cookery school , a reputable teaching facility with alumni including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
speaking to @entity20 , @entity10 , who shot to fame in the @entity23 cookery show the @entity24 , said : ' @entity11 was in my class			1
@entity11 was ill for a few days , so i took notes for her			1
she was a lovely person , but she kept herself to herself			0
you 'd hope so ; a two - week course costs around £ 1,600			1
' students come from all over the world to enjoy dedicated teaching in a friendly atmosphere			0
the guiding principle is to impart enthusiasm for the food and wine trade and instil a lasting love of good food and wine , ' reads the website			0

' the teaching staff are trained professional chefs , with experience in the real world of restaurants and commercial catering and renowned chefs , cookery writers and masters of wine regularly demonstrate or lecture at the school			0
the cookery course news comes just after we learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her @entity84 apartment , as well as at @entity85			2
@entity11 and @entity56 have splashed out on a sleek , modern new kitchen - full of restaurant - standard equipment with the finest furnishings and underfloor heating beneath a reclaimed stone floor			1
the focal point of the room is said to be a dining table for at least eight people			0
@entity11 has taken advice from food writer @entity97 ( her mother - in - law @entity99 ’s son ) who loves a large dinner party in a kitchen			1
perfectly polite : @entity10 said that @entity11 , pictured last week at @entity102 with husband @entity56 , kept herself to herself but was a ' lovely person ' @entity11 and @entity56 have already kitted out @entity84 with these products and are now said to be installing one of the giant fridge - freezers at @entity85			1
also used by @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , sir @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , these monolithic fridges come complete with an air - purification system invented by @entity115 that kills bacteria , automatic icemakers which make crescent - shaped cubes ( said to melt more slowly ) and lights on every shelf so no forgotten food ever goes mouldy at the back			0
a special salad drawer is kept a few degrees cooler to keep the royal rocket and radishes crisp			0
the @entity126 have also invested in a £ 8,000 @entity128 double - oven with ( separately ) five induction rings on a black ceramic hob , which boasts an ‘ eye - catching ’ cobalt blue interior ( useful for spotting burnt - on food ) , and ten different ‘ cooking modes ’ which vary temperature and airflow at the touch of a button depending on whether @entity11 is baking a cake or cooking a roast			1
learning at the best : @entity34 is situated in @entity33 and claims on its website to have ' an international reputation as a first class culinary institute for chefs ' supercool : the £ 15,000 @entity147 - style fridge freezer ( left ) and the £ 8,000 oven by the same company ( right ) but it seems perfectionist @entity11 is set on having only the @entity150 : a £ 149.99 @entity152 four - slice toaster in silver ( a favourite among @entity156 friends ) and a £ 420 @entity158 mixer ( a @entity160 stalwart ) are all on the list			1
a set of £ 159 restaurant - standard , hand - made @entity163 knives from @entity164 ( this brand is one of the oldest knife - makers in the world ) are included , too			2
and that is not to forget the quick - boil kettle , a £ 1,000 state - of - the - art coffee maker ( at this price , it will be barrista - quality and able to make lattes , cappuccinos and flat whites at the touch of a button ) and crystal and glass from @entity183			2
here , champagne glasses are around £ 169 each , water glasses , £ 45.95 and a simple water jug £ 92			0
@entity11 ’s perfectionism also extends to the health of herself and her family , and , of course , her figure			2
the kitchen will feature a £ 100 silver ‘ @entity198 ’ blender , the very latest juicer that keeps the goodness from the fibre in the drink			2
like many building works , the @entity200 project has apparently overrun , which means that the talked - about summer party there has been delayed			0
there is speculation that @entity11 is concerned about being so far away from her parents if she spends too much time in @entity209			0
but then again , once she ’s finally moved into this showcase of modern efficiency and luxury , she might discover she does n’t mind quite so much .			0

@entity10 said @entity11 was ill for a few days so she took notes for her
@entity216 is world famous and a two - week course costs around £ 1,600
@entity11 's kitchen at @entity84 is *undergoing* hefty refurbishment
