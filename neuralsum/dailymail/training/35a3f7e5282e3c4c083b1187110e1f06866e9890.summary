by @entity1 reporter published : 05:33 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 31 october 2013 @entity2 is known for his wacky use of ingredients like snail porridge and his michellin - starred restaurants			1
but customers have snubbed the celebrity chef in the latest food awards by @entity10			1
his restaurant @entity12 failed to crack the top ten for fine dining , while rival @entity16 ’s restaurant @entity18 was named the @entity20 ’s favourite			1
the restaurant in @entity22 was snubbed by customers and failed to make the @entity20 's top ten feeling the heat ? @entity2 in his lab in @entity22 next to the @entity12 which failed to impress customers in this year 's awards @entity18 is also the only @entity20 restaurant to be named among the top ten favourites in the world			1
he said ' i am thrilled that we have been awarded both these wonderful accolades ! they are huge achievements for the team and me at @entity18			2
it has always been imperative that we listen to our guests ’ feedback to help us exceed their expectations and it inspires us to continue to strive for perfection			2
' it ’s a setback for @entity2 having bested other big name rivals in previous years to take the coveted top spot in the @entity46 and the @entity12 was the only restaurant to be awarded ten out of ten			1
the @entity12 was the bespectacled chef ’s first restaurant when he opened it back in 1995 and he soon garnered a reputation for using chemistry in the kitchen			2
outlandish dishes like egg and bacon ice cream saw the cook well on his way to three @entity59 stars			0
@entity61 's @entity60 was snubbed but there was some consolation for the tv chef as his @entity66 - based @entity65 came third			1
elsewhere the awards spell good news for @entity20 chefs			1
second in the country was @entity72 ’s @entity71 in @entity73			0
@entity74 chef @entity16 has welcomed news that customers ranked his restaurant top in the @entity20 for fine dining			1
his restaurant @entity18 was also the only @entity20 restaurant to make the world list head chef @entity81 has extra reason to crack out the champagne there as the two @entity59 - starred restaurant , housed in a @entity86 and set in 55 acres of woodland , also comes ninth in @entity88			1
@entity10 ’s @entity89 said ‘ this year ’s list of @entity94 ’ @entity91 award winners proves just how diverse fine dining experiences have become across the @entity20			1
whether you ’re as far north as @entity96 or as far south as @entity97 , you ’ll be able to find a @entity94 ’ choice winner close by			0

@entity123 , @entity66 , @entity124 it was n't only @entity20 's top chefs who failed to make the cut and @entity128 will be licking his wounds after his restaurant @entity131 in @entity132 missed out			1
the world ’s number one restaurant is the three @entity59 starred @entity136			2
perhaps not surprisingly it is located in @entity138 which is considered the culinary home of fine dining			0
customers were impressed by its prices which start at £ 56 per person for a weekday lunch			0
restaurants in the @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and the @entity154 complete the worlds ’ top ten			1
there is irony in the awards list since before opening the @entity12 , @entity2 had actually previously worked for a week at @entity16 's @entity160 in @entity100			1
@entity161 has two @entity59 stars and the @entity100 eatery was founded by @entity16 himself in 1994			2
it was also used for filming the @entity167 's reality show the restaurant and prices there start at £ 79 a head .			2

@entity2 's restaurants fail to crack top ten in @entity10 's awards
rival @entity16 takes top spot in the @entity20 and also cracks @entity88 list
@entity61 's *flagship* the restaurant is also snubbed
