in any totalitarian regime , if you upset the dear leader then you become a non-person – literally			0
even if , as in the case of @entity6 ’s @entity5 , you are that leader ’s powerful deputy and uncle			0
as these pictures show , the unfortunate @entity5 yesterday found himself erased from history , his image removed from previously published official photos and videos			0
@entity6 has released images of the moment @entity17 's uncle was dragged from a meeting by police following his dismissal from government for ' criminal acts that baffle imagination '			1
in the new versions @entity5 has been either cropped out of the image or digitally moved so that his face can not be seen			0
the hermit state has reportedly ' thrown the book ' at @entity17 's former second - in - command , @entity5 , accusing him today of a string of crimes including womanising , alcohol abuse and ' living a depraved life			1
' insisting @entity5 had failed to toe the party line , the government , in an astonishingly frank and poetic revelation , said he had ' dreamed different dreams '			2
such a public dismissal is extraordinarily rare for the hideaway state , which normally goes to extreme lengths to keep its internal affairs secret from the international community			2
removed from film : it had already become clear that @entity5 ( circled ) was out of favour - his face was blurred out or he was completely hidden in a propaganda documentary featuring @entity17 , whereas previously his presence was obvious and within days of his dismissal , @entity5 was already beginning to be erased from the country 's history as a previously recorded documentary about @entity17 was released with the disgraced statesman airbrushed out of every scene			1
and to cap his public humiliation , state television reportedly aired footage of @entity5 being arrested by uniformed police officers during a high - profile meeting in @entity29 in front of hundreds of stony - faced colleagues			1
@entity5 was said by @entity84 's intelligence agency last week to have been removed from the number two position in the leadership , but there was no official confirmation of this from the @entity6 at the time			2
airbrushed out : in this still from documentary " @entity95 " , re-broadcast on @entity6 state broadcaster @entity93 on december 7 , @entity5 appears to have been completely airbrushed out from the original ( top ) now it has come - and far more robustly than @entity6 watchers had ever expected			0
' @entity5 and his followers committed criminal acts baffling imagination and they did tremendous harm to our party and revolution , ' said the official @entity107 news agency			0
issuing the dismissal confirmation following a meeting of the ruling @entity103 , the agency said @entity17 was present and , despite family ties , made it clear that @entity5 's behaviour made it imperative that his uncle should be removed from office			1
the news agency said that among @entity5 's indiscretions was mismanagement of the country 's finances			2
one of @entity5 's aides , holding many of his secrets , recently defected to @entity84 agents in @entity125			0
@entity107 said @entity5 had also been found to have indulged in ' womanising ' , corruption and abusing alcohol and drugs			1
cropped out : in this grab taken from the documentary , @entity5 ( circled ) has been simply cropped out of the shot taken during a trip to a museum erased : in the original ( top ) @entity5 can be seen accompanying @entity17 on another official visit but in the edited version he is nowhere to be seen ' @entity5 pretended to uphold the party and leader , but was engrossed in such factional acts such as dreaming different dreams and involving himself in double dealing behind the scene , ' said @entity107			1
' affected by the capitalist way of living , @entity5 committed irregularities and corruption and led a dissolute and depraved life			0
' it has not been revealed what @entity5 's punishment is , but the worst two sentences are death or life in a harsh labour camp			0
family : @entity17 ( right ) was reportedly present at his dismissal and , despite family ties , made it clear the behaviour of @entity5 ( left ) made it imperative that his uncle should be removed from office womanising : @entity107 said @entity5 ( far right ) had also been found to have indulged in ' womanising ' , corruption and abusing alcohol and drugs news spreads : @entity84 people watch a news program about the alleged dismissal of @entity5 at a railway station in @entity172 unconfirmed reports suggested @entity5 may already have been executed			1
the removal of @entity5 is thought to be part of 32 - year - old @entity17 's intention to surround himself with a younger cabal			1
@entity6 watchers suggest that the defection of @entity5 's aide recently has particularly angered @entity17			2
two other highly respected aides were shot down by a firing squad although just what they had done wrong has not been revealed .			0
