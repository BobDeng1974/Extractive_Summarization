@entity1 winner @entity0 has welcomed 24 - hour drug testing in cycling			1
@entity0 's comments come in the wake of a damning report by the @entity7 to address doping in the sport and criticism from @entity12 champion @entity11 that the 2013 @entity1 winner was allowed a therapeutic use exemption to compete at the @entity15 last year			1
' i for one welcome 24hr testing			1
it may be an inconvenience but if it can help clean up the sport that i love lets do it , ' @entity0 said on his official @entity22 account			2
champion cyclist @entity0 says he would welcome 24hour drug testing in the sport he loves @entity0 trains for @entity24 in the mountains of @entity26 , @entity27 in january @entity11 has called on cycling 's governing body , the @entity28 , to do more to police the ' disturbing grey area ' of @entity31 and believes @entity32 should not have been granted a @entity31 for a powerful corticosteroid to compete at the 2014 @entity15 after complaining of chest pains			1
the former @entity12 and world road - race champion who retired from cycling two years ago , wrote in @entity37 that @entity28 president @entity38 should apologise to the rest of the riders in the race for failing them			0
' i do n't think it is at all right that @entity0 should have the race and prize money taken off him retrospectively , but @entity38 needs to issue a very clear message : he should be apologising to the rest of the riders for failing them , ' @entity11 said			1
' that @entity31 application should not have been approved ; @entity0 and @entity50 should have had a clear choice of either riding without steroids or pulling out			2
' i never found i could be anywhere near the front of a long race when i was ill. ' @entity0 has been criticised for winning the 2014 @entity15 while taking therapeutic drugs the @entity50 cyclist 's greatest achievement thus far has been winning the @entity59 the @entity7 report , published on monday , showed how the culture and previous practices of the @entity28 allowed @entity63 to cheat , including the retrospective issuing of a @entity31 to cover up a positive test at the @entity66			1
when the granting of @entity69 's @entity31 came to light last june , the @entity28 and the @entity67 said procedures had been properly followed			0
but @entity11 feels @entity38 should not leave himself open to a situation where he could be accused of favouring a @entity50 rider - ' the @entity50 team of which @entity38 was a founding board member , ' she said			2
however , @entity38 said the rules had subsequently been tightened to ensure all @entity31 applications went through an independent committee			0
' ms @entity11 's accusation is simply wrong , ' said @entity38 , who since ousting @entity80 as @entity28 president has overseen the @entity7 report that sought to shed light on cycling 's darkest days and introduced new anti-doping measures			0
former olympic gold medalist @entity11 has criticised @entity0 for racing while taking therapeutic drugs ' i made it a firm pledge that i would separate myself from all anti-doping processes , specifically to avoid any potential conflict of interest , both for me personally and for the @entity28 in its role as governing body for the sport			1
' and i have lived up to that pledge			0
' when it came to our attention that we were following an outdated procedure , we looked again at our processes and in order to ensure absolute integrity			0
' the @entity28 confirmed in june 2014 that all @entity31 decisions must pass through the @entity104 and be approved by three members unanimously , which is a stronger commitment than what is required by the international standard for therapeutic use exemptions			0
' this has added an extra layer of accountability to the decision - making process			0

the 2013 @entity1 winner would welcome 24hr drug testing
