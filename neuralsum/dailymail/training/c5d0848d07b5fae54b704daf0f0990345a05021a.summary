@entity0 has brushed aside any suggestions that @entity2 would be involved in another ‘ biscotto ’ affair and manufacture a convenient draw against the @entity5 in @entity6 on thursday			1
the two countries would both progress to the last 16 with a point each , and to make matters more enticing for conspiracy theorists the two coaches are close friends and former colleagues			1
furthermore the @entity5 team is coached by a @entity16 , @entity15 , and contains five @entity16 - @entity5 players , @entity18 babies who are a legacy of the @entity5 army ’s presence in the old @entity2			1
@entity2 , infamously , beat @entity40 1 - 0 at the 1982 @entity41 in such a game which saw both teams qualify at the expense of @entity45			1
for @entity47 playmaker @entity0 and @entity2 coach @entity48 , there is not even a temptation to settle for a draw against the @entity5			1
@entity0 said : ' i believe that as a player we do not play for a draw			1
we play 90 minutes to score			2
our purpose is to do our utmost to win , and that is what we will do			2
we want to finish top of the group			0
' the infamous @entity2 - @entity40 match will be 32 years ago to the day but @entity48 dismissed its relevance			1
he said : ' nowadays it does not mean anything to this squad			0
most of the players had not been born then			0
they would not have an opinion about that , they never watched it			0
old news : @entity2 head coach @entity48 says historical connections mean nothing to his players bounceback : @entity48 addresses his players as they look to return to winning ways at @entity75 in @entity6 ' it is difficult to understand nowadays , we do not know how it happened			2
it is not a topic for @entity15 or myself , we go to the pitch to win , not for a draw			2
if you want a draw , it never works			2
' @entity0 said he was satisfied with his form in the win over @entity89 and 2 - 2 draw with @entity91 , but admitted he would prefer to be in the playmaker role rather than on the right of an attacking trio			1
he added : ' in terms of football i know i can still get better but i am happy with the two games , and i think the level of my football was very good			0
at the moment i still need to score but i am very happy with my performance			0
' everyone knows i am a playmaker , that is my favourite position , but the coach decides			0
now i am playing on the right , and have i played there a lot on the right as well			0
i do n’t have all the freedom i did but that is not an excuse			0
i know what i can do , but my favourite position is another one			0
' adopted nation : @entity15 mentors the @entity5 side ahead of their clash with his native @entity2 @entity118 down : @entity0 admits he 'd prefer to be in the playmaker role but was happy with his form on the right of the attack tough encounter : @entity2 met an intensely competitive @entity91 team in the 2 - 2 draw , which they expect from the @entity5 side too @entity126 : @entity2			1

@entity2 and @entity5 would both progress to the last 16 of the @entity41 if they drew the *fixture*
@entity0 has said that his country will be looking to win the tie despite the benefits of a draw
