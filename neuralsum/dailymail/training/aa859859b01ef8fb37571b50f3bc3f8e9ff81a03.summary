the shop assistant who allegedly refused to show @entity1 a handbag said the billionaire is a liar @entity1 says she is ' sorry ' a media frenzy emerged after saying she experienced racism during a trip to @entity8			1
' i think that incident in @entity8 was just an incident in @entity8			1
i 'm really sorry that it got blown up			1
' i purposefully did not mention the name of the store			2
i 'm sorry that i said it was @entity8 , ' @entity1 said ' i was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people do n't expect that you would be able to be there , ' she continued			1
in a recent interview with @entity22 , @entity1 recalled a clerk at an upscale @entity25 boutique refusing to show her a handbag			1
@entity1 said she was told she could not afford the $ 38,000 purse			1
' i 'm in a store and the person does n't obviously know that i carry the black card and so they make an assessment based upon the way i look and who i am , ' said @entity1 , who earned $ 77 million in the year ending in june , according to @entity35			1
' i did n't have anything that said " i have money " : i was n't wearing a diamond stud			2
i did n't have a pocketbook			2
i did n't wear @entity41 shoes			2
i did n't have anything , ' said @entity1 on the red carpet			1
' you should be able to go in a store looking like whatever you look like and say " i 'd like to see this "			2
' @entity8 tourism officials and the boutique owner apologized for the incident last week , but @entity1 insists there 's no need			1
' it 's not an indictment against the country or even that store , ' she continued			2
' it was just one person who did n't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag			2
' so no apologies necessary from the country of @entity8			2
' i was n't sure what i should present to her when she came in on the afternoon of saturday , july 20 , so i showed her some bags from the @entity90 collection			2
' i explained to her the bags came in different sizes and materials , like i always do			2
' she looked at a frame behind me			2
far above there was the 35,000 @entity8 franc crocodile leather bag			2
' i simply told her that it was like the one i held in my hand , only much more expensive , and that i could show her similar bags			1
' it is absolutely not true that i declined to show her the bag on racist grounds			1
i even asked her if she wanted to look at the bag			0
' she looked around the store again but did n't say anything else			0
then she went with her companion to the lower floor			0
my colleague saw them to the door			0
they were not even in the store for five minutes			0
' she emphatically denied ever saying to @entity1 : ' you do n't want to see this bag			1
you can not afford it			0
' ms @entity79 said : ' everyone wants to sell a crocodile bag			0
it ’s a misunderstanding ' and insisted her saleswomen put customers first and try to be ' kind ' the shop assistant said she only sells a £ 25,000 handbag a few times a year and said the racist claims are ' absurd ' the saleslady went on : ' this is not true			1
i would never say something like that to a customer			0
good manners and politeness are the @entity135 and the @entity136 in this business			0
' i do n't know why she is making these accusations			1
she is so powerful and i am just a shop girl			1
' i did n't hurt anyone			0
i do n't know why someone as great as her must cannibalize me on tv			0
' if it had all taken place as she claimed , why has she not complained the next day at the wedding of @entity146 with @entity79 , my boss ? she was there also at the @entity146 wedding as a guest			1
i do n't understand it			0
' i spoke to @entity1 in @entity151			1
my @entity151 is okay but not excellent , unfortunately			0
' i did n't know who she was when she came into the store			0
that would n't have made any difference if i had			0
miss @entity1 said of the encounter : ' i could have had the big blow - up thing and thrown down the black card and all that stuff			1
but why do that ? ' girls ' weekend : @entity1 and best friend @entity162 ahead of @entity146 and @entity164 's wedding celebrations in @entity25 , @entity8 ' we work really hard to greet all the people who come into the store with the same level of respect and treat them all equally			1
' if someone asks me whether he or she can see an article , i always present these			0
because that person is a potential buyer			0
and my job is to sell it			0
' i 'm glad if i can sell an article			0
it is a reward for me , if i can sell a nice piece			0
this means that i 'm good at my job			0
' she has worked in the store for five years , says 50 per cent of the clientele come from abroad and that a bag costing nearly £ 25,000 is sold ' only a few times a year			0
' asked what she would say to @entity1 now she added : ' i would apologize and say it was all a misunderstanding			1
i surely did not intentionally want to insult ms. @entity1			1
i hope this nightmare ends soon			0
' @entity1 was in @entity8 to attend the wedding of her friend @entity146 and @entity190 ( pictured )			1
