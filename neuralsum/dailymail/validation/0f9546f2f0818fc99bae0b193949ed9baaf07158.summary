out of @entity5 , out of the @entity1 and on the verge of being out of the @entity4 title race , this was the first of nine games @entity7 simply could not afford not to win			1
@entity9 siege mentality kicked in shortly after the final whistle of wednesday 's @entity12 exit at the hands of @entity14 when @entity15 faced the cameras in the @entity18 tunnel			1
' i will never give up , ever , and i could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either , ' said the defiant goalkeeper			2
@entity24 celebrates after scoring @entity7 's first goal after 25 minutes at the @entity26 the @entity27 opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box before firing into the net @entity7 boss @entity32 believes his side are capable of catching league leaders @entity35 ' @entity36 is a huge game and we turn our focus to that			1
we have no excuse not to throw everything at the @entity4 now and give our all - to the fans , the owner , to everyone			1
' his under - fire manager sang from the same hymn sheet in his programme notes			2
' it 's not impossible for @entity35 to drop six points , ' @entity32 wrote			1
' we have to continue to believe			0
' it is nonsense to suggest there is nothing to play for			0
' the message spread to the home support			0
they like being the underdogs here ( remember last season ? ) and from the off the masses were behind their team			0
after 90 seconds they got a boost they could not have dreamed of when referee @entity66 wrongly sent off @entity67 after last - man @entity68 brought down @entity24 on the edge of the area			0
@entity66 brandishes a straight red card to a bemused @entity67 after just 89 seconds of the match @entity36 players @entity74 and @entity76 protest as @entity66 shows @entity67 the red card @entity77 showed the incident from referee @entity66 's perspective , with no 25 @entity68 the closest to him apparently the joke flying around the @entity36 training ground is that the lookalike pair are never seen in the same place at the same time			1
nobody from the visiting contingent was laughing here			0
this was time for @entity7 to prove themselves and prove to the nation that there is still life left in the title race			1
@entity24 , with no goals in six outings since his Â£ 28million switch from @entity93 , had his own point to make and he did so to break the deadlock , calmly capitalising on a lucky deflection to neatly turn , set himself up and fire the home side into the lead			0
after help from the referee , @entity7 then got some from @entity36			1
for long periods , with a game of attack vs defence taking place , the @entity26 resembled a school playground			0
the woeful defensive mix - up that handed @entity110 the second goal on a plate would have caused red faces in the classroom , let alone a @entity4 dressing room			1
the procession continued throughout the second half			0
in the absence of @entity120 , out with an @entity122 problem , @entity118 probed and created			0
with @entity36 reluctant to leave their own half there were few occasions when @entity15 , so busy on wednesday night , had to contemplate taking off his slippers and putting down his pipe			1
@entity7 midfielder @entity110 doubled his side 's lead in the 40th minute with a close - range finish @entity7 playmaker @entity131 added a third in the 77th minute to complete the rout at the @entity26 @entity134 inexplicably headed onto the bar from close range but other than that there was little to lift the mood of those who had travelled from the @entity141 which will have darkened further when @entity131 deflected sub @entity143 's shot home for the third			2
at times this was @entity7 back to their fluent best			1
quick short passes and chance after chance against overwhelmed opponents			0
too much , however , should not be read into this cakewalk			0
tougher challenges will lie ahead and @entity32 , who believes a lack of goals is what is hurting his team the most , will have been upset by the number of missed chances			2
but on a sunny , spring afternoon at the @entity26 we saw the first shoots of a @entity7 recovery which might just see a title challenge blossom .			2

@entity7 bounced back from their @entity12 defeat by @entity14
the @entity4 eased to *victory* against the @entity36
@entity36 were reduced to 10 men inside the first two minutes
*pressure* was starting to build on @entity32 after @entity5 exit
