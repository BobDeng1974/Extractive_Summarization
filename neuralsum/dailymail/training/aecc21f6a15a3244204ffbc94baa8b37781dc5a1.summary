a criminologist has claimed @entity1 could be a meat cart driver from @entity3 and his blood - splattered appearance may have been what helped him evade justice @entity1 was a meat cart driver in @entity3 , who legitimately blood - spattered appearance helped him evade justice , a criminologist has claimed			1
dr @entity12 from @entity13 believes ' carman ' @entity14 , whose early route to work coincided with locations of ripper killings , should be considered a suspect			1
@entity14 was found leaning over victim @entity21 ' body on @entity22 in @entity3 on august 31 , 1888 and told police he had only been there a few minutes			1
but research has revealed that he lied to police about his name , calling himself @entity29 , and it was likely that he was with her body for about nine minutes			0
he also passed @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 at roughly the same times as the ripper killings - while another happened in @entity39 , where his mother lived			0
it is a theory that joins many others in relation to the string of murders during a three - month period in 1888 when six women were killed on the streets of @entity48 's @entity3			1
their throats were slashed and bodies mutilated but no one was ever caught and ' the @entity1 's ' identity remains one of the world 's greatest crime mysteries			1
in the years that have passed since the killing spree , many high - profile suspects have been suggested including @entity60 , the grandson of @entity61 and sir @entity62 , the @entity61 's doctor			1
dr @entity12 , who worked with tv producer @entity64 and @entity66 journalist @entity65 in a new @entity68 documentary about the killer , drew up a profile of the likely murderer			1
he predicted that @entity1 would have been local and able to walk the streets in the early hours without being suspected			1
dr @entity12 said : ' he [ @entity73 ] would certainly be a person of interest and , while the evidence against him is circumstantial , he would have a case to answer			1
' there could n't feasibly be a re-opening of the case as the ripper is most certainly deceased by now , but periodically reviews of historical cases can be sanctioned			0
an illustration of a @entity85 meat cart driver , who is weighing dog meat for sale , similar to the job @entity73 had in 1888 ' again , there are no living witnesses or forensics of any sort so the basis of any investigation would be slightly flawed			2
' @entity73 could be a match for the profile - along with many others - but whether he fits the conspiracy element that fascinates the public is another matter			1
' dr @entity12 claims that @entity1 could be @entity14 , whose route to work coincided with the killing locations in @entity3 he added that because of his job as a meat cart driver , @entity73 would have been ' routinely covered in blood '			1
@entity64 added : ' @entity73 was discovered standing over the body but bizarrely no - one seemed to think that was important			1
' dr @entity12 said investigations in @entity14 's life showed his mother was ' a pivotal figure ' for him and he lived very close to her			1
but two months before the @entity1 killings he moved further away to a new address while his daughter remained living with his mother			2
dr @entity12 said that could have been due to some trauma and added : ' a big upheaval in the family just months before the killings could be of some significance			1
' barrister @entity123 believes @entity73 's early lies and his passing by the murder scenes could have warranted a court case			1
he said : ' he is somebody who seems to be acting in a way that is suspicious , which a jury would not like			0
' when the coincidences mount up against a defendant , it becomes one coincidence too many			0
' @entity14 died in 1920 and was survived by his wife who eventually passed away on september 12 , 1940 in @entity135 , east @entity48			2
an image depicting police discovering one of the victims of the murders in @entity48 which took place in 1888 several theories have been manufactured over the years concerning the ' @entity1 ' killings numerous individuals have been accused of being the serial killer			1
at the time , police suspected the @entity1 must have been a butcher , due to the way his victims were killed and the fact they were discovered near to the dockyards , where meat was brought into the city			1
there are several alleged links between the killer and royals			0
first is sir @entity62 , the royal physician			0
many have accused him of helping get rid of the prostitutes ' bodies , while others claim he was the @entity1 himself			2
another book named queen @entity61 's surgeon sir @entity162 as the infamous killer			2
he had a surgery in @entity3 at the time			0
another theory links the murders with queen @entity61 's grandson , @entity60 , the @entity167			0
at one point , cotton merchant @entity168 was the number one suspect , following the publication of some of his diary which appeared to suggest he was the killer			2
however some believe the diary to be a forgery although no one has been able to suggest who forged it			0
other suspects include @entity182 , a @entity34 - born barrister			0
he committed suicide in the @entity184 seven weeks after the last murder			0
@entity186 , otherwise known as @entity187 , poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903			0
another suspected by polive was @entity191			0
he was admitted to @entity192 and died there			0
dr @entity193 , poisoned four @entity48 prostitutes with strychnine and was hanged			0
some of the more bizarre links include @entity197 , author of the @entity199 books , who taught at @entity201 until 1881 - which was at the forefront of the @entity1 murder scenery			2
@entity206 's father - lord @entity205 - has also been named as a potential suspect			2
crime writer @entity208 believes she has ' cracked ' the case by unearthing evidence that confirms @entity211 , an influential artist , as the prime suspect			0
her theories have not been generally accepted			0
while author @entity214 raised the possibility that @entity1 might actually be ' @entity216 ' - a @entity217 soldier in the seduction of @entity219 , his novel about the @entity221 of the final victim , that it was perhaps not ' @entity223 , but ' @entity216 ' - a @entity217 soldier			2
victims : @entity225 ( left ) is said to be @entity1 's third victim while @entity227 ( right ) was killed a few hours later			1

dr @entity12 believes @entity14 could be a suspect
@entity73 's early route to work coincided with @entity1 killing locations
he was also found leaning over one of the victims - @entity234
dr @entity12 predicted killer would have been local and walk streets in early hours without suspicion making @entity73 a strong ' person of interest '
