@entity0 has agreed a release from his @entity3 contract as he seeks a new deal with @entity5 to try to reignite his hopes of an @entity8 recall			1
@entity0 was axed by @entity8 in february 2014 after their whitewash in @entity10 , but is hoping for a still unlikely international return in time for this summer 's @entity13 rematch			1
he confirmed , on his website kevinpietersen.com that he has taken another key step to that end by agreeing a release from the majority of his contract with the @entity21			0
@entity0 's plans to return to county cricket with @entity5 have moved a significant step closer @entity0 said : ' i 'm hugely grateful for all the support and understanding i 've received from everyone at the @entity21 and the @entity3			1
' my focus is now very much on the upcoming season in @entity8 , and i 'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible			0
' @entity5 de-registered @entity0 at the end of last season but have nonetheless long been front - runners to re-sign him			2
his availability for all formats , as soon as possible , has appeared a starting point for that to happen - and @entity0 's presence in early season , rather than spending six weeks at the @entity3 , is therefore a key development			2
@entity0 plays a shot on the second day of the @entity13 series between @entity8 and @entity10 last year @entity8 and @entity45 chairman @entity44 this month revived the record - breaking 34 - year - old batsman 's hopes of a return to the fold , contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body			1
but a pre-requisite from @entity44 was that @entity0 must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then , of course , start scoring runs again			1
@entity0 may still be recalled by the @entity21 for just a one - week period , should they qualify for the @entity3 knockout stages between may 19 and may 24			2
that , however , ought not to be an insurmountable problem for any county interested in securing his services			0
@entity0 bats for @entity63 during the @entity65 semi-final match against the @entity66 he added : ' i 've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent @entity8 , and i 'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set - up			2
' to once again put on that @entity8 shirt would be a privilege and an honour , but now i have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection			0
' a statement on his website spelled out @entity0 's next move - without specifying @entity5 as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an @entity8 return in time for the start of the ashes in july			1
@entity0 was involved in a high - profile dispute with @entity8 coach @entity89 back in 2009 it read : ' the four - time @entity13 winner , who is also @entity8 's highest ever runscorer in all formats , will ... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the @entity8 squad for the upcoming @entity13 series			1
' @entity0 quickly made it clear at the start of this month that he was delighted to take @entity44 at his word , that the slate will be wiped clean for all under his tenure , and he has since confirmed he has already spoken to the incoming chairman on the telephone			0
the controversial @entity107 - born batsman has received little encouragement yet from other quarters			0
former @entity8 star @entity0 previously rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him @entity112 managing director @entity111 pinpointed @entity0 's ' disengagement ' with his team - mates during his last test match to date - the defeat in @entity117 which consigned @entity8 to their 5 - 0 2013/14 ashes whitewash			1
@entity111 has not shifted from that in the intervening months			0
when @entity8 announced their squad last week , to travel under @entity122 and without @entity0 for three tests in the @entity124 , national selector @entity120 repeated many times that he is simply ' not part of our plans '			0
@entity0 , however , has said he will ' do anything ' to play for @entity8 again .			0
