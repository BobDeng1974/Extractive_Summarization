by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 11 february 2013 message : @entity2 , pictured yesterday in @entity3 , said ' unfriendly and inflexible ' visa rules are putting off rich immigrants from coming to @entity6 @entity6 needs to attract rich immigrants who are being put off by ‘ unfriendly and inﬂexible ’ visa rules , @entity2 warned last night			2
the future of the @entity6 economy depends on attracting trade and visitors from powerful economies such as @entity13 - who are being deterred by red tape , the @entity7 said			1
citing figures that suggest the @entity6 is being shunned by tourists and business visitors in favour of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , mr @entity2 said the country ‘ ca n’t afford to miss out ’ on lucrative opportunities			1
his belief in more open borders puts him at odds with some of his @entity29 colleagues			1
the @entity32 ’s views are shared by some in the conservative front benches , including chancellor @entity35 , but home secretary @entity36 and others think relaxing rules could undermine national security			0
mr @entity2 , writing in an article for the @entity42 , said : ‘ @entity13 is the new economic superpower and we must treat its re-emergence with respect : as an opportunity rather than a threat ... our future prosperity will depend on it			0
‘ but if we are serious about trading more with countries such as @entity13 , then we must make sure our borders are as open as possible to genuine tourism , business visitors , investment and trade			1
‘ @entity13 spending on tourism alone has increased 400 per cent in the last decade			2
‘ @entity6 simply ca n’t afford to miss out on that			0
he added : ‘ if we are serious about trading more with countries such as @entity13 , then we must make sure our borders are as open as possible to genuine tourism , business visitors , investment and trade			1
‘ of course , it is necessary to prevent abuse of the immigration rules			0
but equally we can not allow red tape to deter the very people that we want to come to the @entity6 and help make the economy stronger			2
‘ we want to create and promote an image of @entity6 which means and delivers what it says on the tin : open for global business			1
’ @entity6 ’s share of @entity13 visitors has fallen over the last ﬁve years , he said			2
uncompetitive : the business secretary says @entity13 nationals are going to @entity79 instead of @entity6 because of red tape business groups have warned that @entity13 tourists , who spend an average of £ 1,600 per visit , are shunning @entity6 in favour of @entity79 countries			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ with anecdotal evidence of people saying our visa system is unfriendly and inﬂexible , it ’s no wonder that there were only 180,000 @entity13 visitors to the @entity6 in 2011 , a small fraction of those going to continental @entity79			1
‘ @entity6 can compete and win its share of global markets			0
but when the @entity21 and @entity22 have already rolled out the red carpet and are reaping the beneﬁts , we can not afford to lose out			0
’ home secretary @entity36 has recently hit out at criticism of the way the visa system is run , insisting it was something ‘ we can be proud of ’			0
she said last week : ‘ the continued use of spurious ﬁgures and skewed perceptions of the way we run our visa system is damaging its reputation			0
and it is the very people who claim to be pro-growth who are guilty of spreading this harmful message			0

tourists and business visitors are going elsewhere in @entity79 , he says
' we must make sure our borders are as open as possible to genuine tourism , business visitors , investment and trade '
