by @entity0 regardless of your physical state , many fitness gadgets or apps try and push you that bit further			1
but one new sports gizmo has a different approach – it ’ll pipe up and tell you to sit back and put your feet up if it thinks a workout will result in an injury			2
called ‘ check ’ , by @entity12 , the device searches for signs of fatigue in your nervous system before you set off for a run or begin pumping iron , and warns you if there ’s a chance you could be overdoing it			1
assessment : the makers of the check fitness gadget claim that their device can help prevent injuries by warning you if you 're too tired for a workout the gadget ’s website boasts that the check takes just 15 seconds , with the assessment carried out via electrodes that are placed on the forearm ( pictured above )			0
they send tiny pulses of electricity through the body and how your nervous system reacts to these will determine whether the gadget advises you to face the fitness music , or run a bath			1
the website says that it ’s ‘ specifically aimed for sports requiring speed , strength , skill and coordination ’			0
and there are reportedly a number of @entity54 footballers who are fans , so it 's undoubtedly a useful bit of kit			1
however , those not on a footballers ' salary may find it prohibitively expensive			0
it costs £ 225 and many might prefer instead to fashion training regimes for free with the help of common sense and internet research			0
safety first : the gadget measures the response of your nervous system to electronic pulses before deciding whether you should throw in the towel			2

it *'ll* warn you if a workout could *potentially* result in injury
