an ambitious @entity1 plan has been launched to raise the wreck of an historic vessel that sank during an @entity6 hero 's 19th century attempt to be the first to reach the @entity7			1
@entity8 floundered in @entity10 waters off @entity11 after becoming stuck in ice during the daring voyage to the top of the world in 1881 , and has remained there ever since			1
under the command of naval officer @entity17 , the elegant three - master , a former @entity19 gunboat , was 141ft long and kitted out in gold and bronze with its own on - board fireplaces			1
after it sank off the @entity1 coast , the story of how 13 men survived following an epic escape on foot across frozen @entity11 became a legendary tale of courage			1
now the vessel could once more rise from its watery grave			0
it was designed to keep its crew of 33 alive in the frozen wastes , with fireplaces on board and fittings in gold and bronze survival : some of those who finally made it back to safety pictured after surviving their ordeal			1
in all 23 of the crew lost their lives ice - bound : this painting portrays the end of the @entity56 , stuck fast in ice which would eventually crush it			1
its crew are unloading the supplies packed into the three - master remembered : there are two memorials to the @entity56			2
this one is at the mouth of the @entity67 , where the survivors finally came ashore			0
the @entity67 is the largest of @entity11 's rivers @entity6 author @entity71 , who wrote an acclaimed book about the ship 's dramatic final voyage last year , said he has already approached the @entity75 for assistance but feared the current icy political climate would prevent a salvage operation			1
on the other side of the @entity80 , @entity11 adventurer @entity81 -- well - known in @entity1 as a director , screenwriter , tv personality and traveler whose real name is @entity87 -- has begun his own initiative to raise the wreck in consultation with the @entity91 , whose board of trustees is headed by @entity94			1
' this vessel lies at a depth of only 18 meters [ 54 feet ] , with the known location down to one kilometer [ two - thirds of a mile ]			1
so in modern day conditions , to find and raise it is not such a hard task , ' he told @entity103			0
' imagine what kind of event it would be , and what it would do for our relations with @entity6 which are not very good right now			0
' so perhaps we should give them a generous present by raising it			0
' whether such a salvage operation would be seen as a ' generous present ' or a grab at @entity6 property in the context of increasingly tense relations between @entity119 and @entity120 remains to be seen			0
@entity121 : the map shows @entity123 , the freshly - discovered land which the @entity56 was stranded beside - and gives some idea of the sheer remoteness of the sea where the crew found themselves sinking : contemporary illustrations told the story of the @entity56 , claimed by the might of the ice hell : the first stage of their trek saw the crew drag their boats across pack ice which persisted even in the @entity10 's summertime dismal : after their trek across the ice the crew took to their three boats but one capsized with the loss of seven men			1
the two remaining boats separated and took different routes to land safety : the woodcut shows how so few survived when they eventually gathered at @entity153 , capital of the @entity11 territory now known as @entity155 the vessel is a memory of @entity6 's bid to reach the @entity7 and the effort comes amid an increasingly aggressive grab by @entity161 over @entity10 territories			1
@entity119 - along with the @entity6 , @entity163 and other countries bordering the @entity10 - are staking conflicting territorial claims to the potential oil and gas bonanza			0
in recent months , @entity94 has ordered @entity1 to re-establish military bases in the region , and despite economic problems caused by @entity171 sanctions over @entity172 plus low oil prices , he is pouring investment into his vast northern coastline			2
this month has seen a major army drill in the @entity1 @entity10 region			2
ground forces commander col. gen. @entity178 said this week : ' the @entity10 brigades ' role is to defend the @entity1 national interests			2
' he vowed that ' specialized equipment and weaponry will guarantee their effective operation in the northern latitudes '			0
@entity1 is currently making a claim to the @entity189 that major undersea ridges are an extension of the @entity11 land mass. if approved , @entity119 will get the right to exploit the energy riches			1
eight years ago , a submarine planted a titanium @entity1 flag on the seabed under the @entity7 , signaling @entity94 's intentions			1
last summer , the @entity200 strongman broke off from speaking about strife - torn @entity172 to tell a youth camp audience : ' we should pay more attention to issues of development of the @entity10 and the strengthening of our position here			2
' the @entity209 estimates that the @entity210 includes 22 per cent of global recoverable energy resources , and @entity94 is determined to get his hands on the lion 's share			0
the @entity214 harks back to @entity6 's attempts to claim the same territory			0
and the vessel herself represents a tale of adventure in the most difficult circumstances - and a dramatic battle for survival			2
built in 1861 , as the @entity226 - class gunboat @entity227 , she lies off the most northerly island of @entity1 's diamond - rich @entity155 , also known as @entity155			1
snow - bound : @entity123 , which was named by the crew of the @entity56 today pack ice : the scale of the ice around @entity123 shows why the @entity214 became stuck mapped : the thin black line shows the progress of the different boats towards land			1
just 10 men survived captain : @entity17 was captain of the @entity56 but was one of those to lose his life mission : @entity200 - backed adventurer @entity87 wants to lead the @entity1 expedition to raise the @entity56 large crowds watched her set sail from @entity247 on her fateful voyage on 7 july 1879 , to begin a daring bid backed by the @entity6 government to reach the @entity7			1
she progressed well through the @entity251 but , just two months after leaving port , she caught fast in ice near @entity254 and drifted northwards for almost two years			0
during their ice - bound odyssey floating through the @entity10 waters , @entity17 and his crew maintained unique scientific records of their journey			1
' a full meteorological record is kept , soundings are taken , astronomical observations made and positions computed , dip and declination of the needle observed and recorded - everything we can do is done as faithfully , as strictly , as mathematically as if we were at the @entity7 itself , or the lives of millions depended on our adherence to routine , ' he wrote in his journal			2
they even discovered two previously unknown islands and duly named them @entity8 and @entity123			2
but their success was short - lived and on 12 june 1881 , the pressure of the creaking ice crushed and sank their ship			2
the men did have enough time to salvage food onto small boats but they were left marooned more than 500 miles north of the @entity11 mainland			1
yet what happened next became legendary as the crew , dragging their provisions across the ice , somehow survived ~ and even discovered more land which they claimed for @entity6 , though it is now @entity1			1
author : @entity71 approached the @entity75 to discuss the possibility of them retrieving their own vessel but says the current political climate makes it unlikely			2
he is pictured with a mammoth tusk memorial : the @entity303 in the @entity304			0
its design was based on the cairn raised in @entity11 in the aftermath of the death of most of the crew remembered : @entity71 published his history of the epic struggle of the @entity8 last year this uncharted outpost was named @entity314 , after eccentric @entity6 newspaper tycoon @entity315 who had funded the @entity10 mission			2
none of the 33 crew were lost in the sinking but 20 perished - including captain @entity17 himself - during the grueling trek to reach the mainland			1
some wreckage from the @entity8 was found in june 1884 on an ice floe close to southern @entity325 , allowing scientists to establish that @entity10 ice was in constant motion			0
writer @entity71 - author of ' in the @entity330 : the @entity331 and @entity332 of the @entity8 ' - recently said he was keen on finding the ship to ensure a piece of @entity6 history is not lost forever			0
' we know almost exactly where the @entity8 is because when it sank , @entity17 's men took very meticulous positional readings			0
' the only problem is that it 's in @entity1 waters , near some islands that are somewhat disputed - the @entity343 ( named after the captain )			1
' so the hurdles for finding the @entity8 are more geopolitical than archaeological			0
' i 'm hoping this book might create an environment that down the line , when our relationship improves with the @entity1 , we could send out an expedition to recover the ship			0
' i 've spoken with some folks in the @entity75 and at @entity355 ( @entity355 ) who are interested			0
' it 's certainly one of my passions			0
one of my secret wishes			0
' the voyage was ' at the very end of the nautical age of polar exploration , when there were still people who thought you could somehow reach the @entity7 by ship , ' he said			1
' the @entity7 seemed as inaccessible as the moon			0
there was also a good bit of nationalism behind it			0
we wanted to beat the @entity19 and the @entity375 and the other powers			0
' it took until 1908 for the first men to eventually reach the @entity7 on foot			1
in the @entity330 by @entity71 is available on @entity380			0

@entity382 set off in 1879 in an attempt to become the first vessel to reach the @entity7
she and her crew of 33 became stuck in ice off island they named @entity123 , hundreds of miles from nearest land
they trekked 500 miles across the ice to safety with 13 men surviving the epic journey
@entity1 explorer is planning to raise the wreck - which lies in just 50ft of water - but comes at time @entity200 is trying to seize undersea mineral riches
three - masted vessel was built in @entity19 by the @entity406 as a gunboat , sold to the @entity75 and equipped for the voyage with on - board fireplaces
