by @entity0 a teenager has not eaten a meal for almost five years because she has a rare condition which paralyses her stomach			1
@entity6 - @entity5 , 19 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has been in agony for years since she developed gastroparesis - a rare condition which paralyses the stomach muscles			1
the teenager is now only able to eat the tiniest amounts of food and is fed through a feeding tube directly to her bloodstream			1
@entity6 - @entity5 , 19 , has a rare condition which means her stomach is paralysed and unable to process food @entity21 said : ‘ having this condition has really changed my life			1
‘ i ca n’t sit down for meals with my family anymore , i ca n’t eat out with my friends - i ca n’t even tuck into a sunday lunch			1
‘ i have a twin brother , @entity28 , but we ca n’t eat cake together on our birthday - if i tried , i ’d just be sick			1
‘ it is really hard but i try and stay positive , and i just hope i can beat this horrible illness one day			1
’ @entity21 ’s condition first developed when she returned from a volunteering project in @entity36			1
she said : ‘ i was so excited to go to @entity36 with school and i could n’t wait to get out there and get stuck in			1
@entity21 vomits if she tries to eat , so she has to be tube - fed to ensure she gets the nutrients she needs @entity21 ( pictured with her mother , @entity40 ) has tried various treatments but all have failed she now has to be fed directly into her bloodstream through a tube in her neck			1
she is pictured with her mother , @entity40 , and the device that supplies her nutrients ‘ but when i came back i just felt awful and started to get really ill. ‘ i assumed it was just food poisoning i ’d picked up out there , but it just got worse and worse			1
’ gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way			1
symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating , bloating , loss of appetite and weight loss			1
the problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach			1
in many cases , the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes			0
other possible causes include parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and some medications			0
the condition can not be cured but it can usually be controlled			0
some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet , for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft , easily digestible foods			0
in some cases , symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of @entity87 into the valve between their stomach and small intestine			2
if all of these options fail , a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food			2
if none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food , the patient will have to be fed through a tube			1
source : @entity104 it soon became clear that @entity21 needed medical attention , and her parents took her to the doctors			2
her mother and full - time carer , @entity40 , 46 , said : ‘ at first we assumed that @entity112 just had @entity114 belly - something that she ’d picked up when she was out there , but she was n’t getting any better			1
‘ eventually we took her to the doctors but they seemed stumped too			2
‘ at first they thought it was something to do with her appendix , but they did an operation and could n’t find anything			2
‘ then they thought it might be gynaecological but again that was n’t the answer			2
‘ medics even began to suggest that @entity112 ’s condition could be psychological			0
‘ we were quite annoyed that there was a suggestion that this was all in her head , when that quite clearly was n’t the case			0
’ after further tests and examinations @entity21 was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis			2
her mother said : ‘ we were shocked to hear that her stomach muscles were paralysed - we had no idea that something like that was even possible , but it was a relief to get a diagnosis too			1
‘ @entity112 had lost about three stone in weight , so it was great to think that something was finally going to be done and she could get better			0
‘ but it soon became apparent that this was n’t the kind of diagnosis we had wanted			0
’ @entity21 has tried various treatments since her diagnosis , including a feeding tube directly into her bowel , and a gastric pacemaker , but none have cured her condition			1
the gastric pacemaker sent electrical pulses to her stomach to try and stimulate the muscles , but it failed to help her			1
she now relies on a feeding tube that sends nutrients straight into her bloodstream through a drip in a vein			1
this means the nutrition bypasses her normal digestive system altogether			0
@entity21 first fell ill after returning from a trip to @entity36 ( pictured )			1
she initially thought she had ' @entity176 ' but decided to visit her doctor when her condition continued to deteriorate doctors were initially baffled by @entity21 's illness and even suggested it could be psychological her mother said : ‘ the tube she has now feeds nutrients into her jugular vein and transports them to her heart and the rest of the bloodstream			1
‘ she is fed for 14 hours overnight to keep her alive			2
‘ at the moment that is the best treatment that she can have , and we just have to hope that there is something better around the corner			0
’ but despite being fed essential nutrients , @entity21 still wishes she could eat like everybody else			2
she said : ‘ i still get cravings for things like chocolate , sweets and burgers			0
‘ i might have a teeny tiny bite every now and then , just to satisfy the craving , but it ’s not the same			0
‘ it ’s horrible because i used to love different foods so much , and now i ca n’t have any of them			0
‘ i ’m exhausted all the time , so i have to see what my friends get up to from @entity207			0
@entity21 's nutrients are now given to her in a way that completely bypasses her digestive system @entity21 's food has to be specially prepared for her and is fed into her bloodstream for 14 hours a day			2
she is pictured with a fridge full of the solution she is fed ‘ my twin brother , @entity28 , is a soldier and sometimes it can be difficult seeing him so active when i ’m cooped up in bed all the time - but of course i ’m so proud of him			1
‘ i ’ve come to accept my condition now and i take each day as it comes			0
‘ i hope that one day , i ’ll be back to my normal self , but for now i try to stay as positive as i can			0
’ dr @entity222 , a @entity223 at @entity224 , in @entity225 , who treats @entity21 said : ‘ gastroparesis is rare			2
it is a condition describing weakness of the muscles of the stomach , meaning that the food in the stomach does not empty well			1
‘ this results in a feeling of fullness that continues for longer than normal , nausea and vomiting			0
@entity238 will lose weight as a result			0
‘ it is estimated that it affects one in 50,000 of the population and is more common in women than men			0
‘ the commonest cause is diabetes , occurring in diabetics who have had poor diabetic control over many years			2
@entity21 desperately hopes she will eventually be able to eat normally again @entity21 's illness means she is exhausted all the time and she says it is hard not to be able to go out with her friends			0
image shows tubes entering her stomach before she started being fed through a vein in her neck ‘ however , there is an increasing group of patients that have gastroparesis as part of a problem affecting the whole of the gut - when the nerves or muscles in the gut do not work in a coordinated way			1
this causes abdominal pain , vomiting and weight loss			0
‘ this is a dysmotility of the gut and while there are a number of possible causes , generally we do not know the cause and this is called @entity283 ( @entity284 )			0
‘ this is a young group of patients and the symptoms of gastroparesis are often missed			0
poor appetite , vomiting and weight loss in young women may be considered to be an eating disorder , but for some of these patients gastroparesis may play a part			0
