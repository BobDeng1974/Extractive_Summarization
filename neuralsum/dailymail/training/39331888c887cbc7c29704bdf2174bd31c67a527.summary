in figures published on thursday in @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity2 languish in 12th place in a league table drawn up on the basis of number of players each country has in the tournament			1

in total @entity29 has 82 @entity27 to watch in the @entity4			1
@entity31 ( top , 3rd left ) was the only @entity34 player named in @entity36 's starting line - up in @entity37 number of players each country has in the @entity4 1			1

with just 17 representatives @entity2 trail @entity50 , @entity49 and @entity47 as well as @entity73 finalists @entity46 , @entity45 , @entity43 and @entity48			1
as @entity9 desperately searches for leaders in his new @entity2 the lack of homegrown participation in the competition that kicked off again this week is an ongoing handicap for the national coach			1

in contrast tabe - toppers @entity12 had 10 starters in the @entity25 side and six in the @entity88 @entity27 numbers are also boosted by their 29 exports playing around @entity90			2
just two of @entity80 's starting line - up against @entity93 were @entity34 : @entity94 ( top , 2nd left ) and @entity97 ( top , 2nd right ) it 's more bad news for @entity2 manager @entity9 ( left ) , while @entity12 boss @entity29 will be happy			1
