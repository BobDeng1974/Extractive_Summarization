@entity0 is @entity1 the celebrity dachshund 's favourite time of year , and unwrapping presents is what really makes this camera - loving diva dog most happy			1
that and getting together with his extended family including brother @entity9 , says owner @entity10 , who 's made a star of his dog with an award - winning blog			1
the festive period plays right into the hands of @entity1 , who celebrated the signing of his first book deal while on a trip to @entity21 , sealing the deal with his pawtograph			1
@entity1 and @entity9 approve of the @entity0 turkey before it gets unwrapped and put in the oven no mistaking what time of year it is as @entity1 dons his @entity0 hat and jumper in front of the tree @entity1 the dachshund is all decked out in his cold weather gear and ready to take on the snow with plenty to celebrate , @entity1 , who has over 82,000 likes on @entity39 , also has a chance to parade in his extensive collection of winter outfits and frolic in the snow , as seen in the below video			1
in addition to the book deal @entity1 has a host of merchandise available online , including mugs , t - shirts , bumper stickers and even a calendar that can be ' autographed '			1
and he definitely knows what time of year it is , says @entity10 , 27 , who lives with @entity1 and his girlfriend @entity58 , 27 , in @entity59 , @entity60			1
showing great restraint , @entity1 enjoys the smell of another @entity0 creation in custom oven mitts @entity1 is a dog who is happy to talk turkey , as long as by talk you mean eat turkey while a busy dog , @entity71 knows how to relax - in a fleece , on the sofa , by the fire will do just fine ' he 's seen us wrap presents already and we already have a christmas tree with a few gifts under there , ' @entity10 told @entity81			1
' now he 's just waiting for the day we give him the " ok " to start opening them			2
plus he 's been seeing a lot of family members lately so i 'm sure he knows there 's the big day coming			0
' thoughtful sausage dog @entity71 looks especially studious as he reads a cookbook family happy snaps from last year show @entity1 trying his hand in the kitchen and supervising the cooking of the turkey , for which the end result is quite important to him			1
of course , being a dog and all , knives and hot plates are n't for him			0
but eating sure is with is favourites being turkey and ham			0
' they 're pretty good bets , ' says @entity10			0
' he enjoys a nice saut√©ed carrot as well			0
all in all , he 's not too picky as long as it 's not too healthy			0
' when it comes to the time for presents the dog that seems so well - behaved on camera unleashes fury - in a cute , happy way - on anything covered with wrapping paper , including his presents from @entity113 , his mum and dad , and those intended for everyone else			2
' @entity113 sends him some of course			0
he has a big long wishlist we have to send to @entity113 on his behalf every year , ' says @entity10			2
' he definitely opens all his own presents			0
it 's his favourite part of the holidays			0
' he 'll even start opening random presents under the tree , even when they 're not for him			2
he seems to think every present is for him - which i guess is a reasonable assumption on his part being a celebrity and all			0
' check all the pieces are there : @entity1 ( right ) looks a little guilty at the chess board with brother @entity9 @entity1 ( left ) in his @entity113 outfit , which unfortunately for @entity9 means he 's relegated to elf colours believe it or not , @entity1 's owner @entity10 says the dachshund quite likes carrots , but not as much as ham for this year 's @entity0 , @entity1 is hanging out with @entity9 , who lives just outside @entity143 , about 300 miles from @entity59			1
' we have all the family coming together , including his brother @entity9 , who he really does n't get to see very often			1
' @entity1 loves when all the family 's together			2
in fact , i think that 's when he 's most content in life			0
