@entity0 : a history by @entity2 when i started reading this , i assumed that histories of fish and chips were pretty thin on the ground and that @entity2 had hit upon a comparatively unexplored corner of @entity12 cuisine			1
but how wrong i was			0
as he notes in his introduction : ‘ this book follows a tradition of volumes on fish and chips			1
’ these include such seminal works as @entity21 by one @entity22 ( ‘ also known as “ @entity27 ” , ’ ) and social historian @entity24 ’s @entity23 1870 - 1940 , warmly reviewed in the @entity25 ’ review when it was published in 1992			0
all of which begs the question : is there really enough to say about fish and chips to fill one book , let alone a small library ? the answer proves to be yes			1
as with the universe itself , no one quite knows where fish and chips came from			1
while the @entity42 are widely credited with inventing fried fish , and the @entity44 with pioneering the chip , it took an unidentified genius to put the two together			0
is there really enough to say about fish and chips to fill one book , let alone a small library ? the answer proves to be yes whether they had joined forces by 1824 remains open to question , but this is believed to be the date of the first reference to an itinerant fried fish seller in the @entity12			1
it was n’t a happy beginning			0
a mrs @entity60 suffered a ‘ @entity61 ’ when her frying pan caught fire and she went up with it			0
@entity67 ’s 1859 novel @entity65 has a passage about ‘ husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant drops of oil ’			1
with due solemnity , we are informed that : ‘ this would appear to be the first modern use of the word ‘ chips ’ applied to pieces of fried potato			1
’ but it was n’t long before a thick pall of chip fat hung over the nation			0
by 1921 , there were about 25,000 fish and chip shops in the @entity12			2
anyone wondering why fish and chips was so popular with the working class need n’t do too much head - scratching			2
as @entity98 noted in @entity99 : ‘ you ca n’t get much meat for threepence , but you can get a lot of fish and chips			2
’ yet however cheap they were , fish and chips never lost the air of being a treat , this being one of those dishes that no one in their right mind would try to cook at home			2
by the @entity113 , in a bid to retain their popularity , chippies were selling all kinds of deep - fried monstrosities — including spam fritters and , perhaps the greatest artery - clogger of all , the saveloy			0
now they ’ve changed again , leaving their working - class origins way behind and shooting to dizzying heights of trendiness			0
near where i live in @entity125 , there ’s a gleamingly smart fish and chip shop numbering @entity127 among its devotees			1
as his name suggests , @entity2 is not a dyed - in - the - wool @entity131 , but he ’s been fascinated by fish and chips all his life			1
professor of @entity135 at @entity137 ’s @entity136 , he is a bit too fond of words like ‘ methodology ’ for my liking			0
that aside , he ’s written an affectionate , sprightly and crisply informative history of our national obsession			2
the classic dish is now becoming trendy with smart new shops opening and celebrities professing their love of the battered meal but while we , the consumers , continue to wax lyrical — and nostalgic — about the joys of fish and chips , what of the friers themselves ? surely their levels of contentment must have soared with fish and chips ’ changing fortunes ? well , up to a point			1
again we come back to that invaluable source , @entity165 , which once noted with brutal honesty : ‘ a @entity168 ’s life is quite a @entity169			0

is there enough to say about fish and chips to fill a book , let alone a library ?
the answer proves to be yes in this history
no one quite knows where fish and chips came from
the first modern mention of chips appears in @entity67 ’s @entity65
the classic dish is now becoming trendy with smart new shops opening
