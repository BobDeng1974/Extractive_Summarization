the @entity17 history student was ‘ out of his mind ’ on a cocktail of @entity19 , @entity20 and whisky when he laid siege to the royal convoy during the tuition fee protests in @entity25 on december 9 last year			1

yesterday the yob tried to excuse his behaviour , saying that he had not known it was the @entity5			2
but judge @entity54 scoffed at the excuse , saying : ‘ for you , a young man of undoubted high intelligence , education and background , to profess you did n’t know what the @entity5 represented defies belief			1
under attack : the @entity64 of @entity15 and the @entity37 was attacked during the protests jailed : @entity8 outside @entity66 during a break in proceedings ‘ it ’s through the deaths of those many thousands who gave their lives that you have been given the opportunity for the democratic right to protest , but you showed ultimate disrespect to those who fell defending their country			0
‘ such outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour gives a clear indication of how out of control you were that day			0
’ the judge told how @entity1 ’s conduct had prompted a deluge of ‘ vituperative and in many cases obscene ’ hate mail sent to his blameless family			1
however , he accepted that @entity1 had shown contrition the day after his actions , and stressed that his antics at the @entity5 did not form part of the violent disorder charge			0
but sentencing him at @entity66 , @entity92 , he said : ‘ i have to take into account that you have had many advantages which are denied to most young men who come before this court			1
‘ i have no doubt you felt strongly about the legislation regarding student fees , but what you did went far , far beyond proper protest			1
’ @entity1 was wide - eyed in shock as he was led away by a prison officer , while his mother , writer @entity29 , @entity107 , she and her rock star husband , who is worth an estimated £ 78million , hugged their son ’s university friends , many of whom shook with emotion			0
during the hearing , @entity1 ’s lawyer wheeled out no fewer than 13 character references , many from ‘ very distinguished ’ members of society , including @entity119 boss @entity118 and the chief executive of the homeless charity crisis			0
@entity122 , @entity123 , defending , said @entity1 , an ex-pupil at £ 9,000 - a - term @entity124 in @entity125 , was a ‘ gentle ’ student who had been subjected to ‘ serious bullying ’ in the past			1
he said the second - year student – who was adopted by @entity1 – had been catapulted into a downward spiral of drink and drugs by a disastrous meeting last year with his biological father , the radical playwright and poet @entity134			1
mr @entity122 said : ‘ for a period of time starting around august 2010 he was , by his own admission , on something of a continual binge , taking a range of illicit and illegal drugs			0
in his own words , he spent most of the week , effectively every week , tranquillised out of his mind			0
going home alone : @entity1 and his wife @entity29 leave @entity66 following the sentencing of their son @entity148 close family : @entity8 , right , pictured here as his father is awarded a cbe by the @entity153 in 2003 , was given 16 months behind bars today			0

’ mr @entity122 said @entity1 had now sought help from a psychotherapist , had stopped using drugs and cut down his drinking			0
@entity1 admitted violent disorder at a hearing in may , but denied he was responsible for the bin attack			0
