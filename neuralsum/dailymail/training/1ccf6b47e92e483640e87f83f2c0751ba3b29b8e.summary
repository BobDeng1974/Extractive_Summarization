@entity1 ' eyes are now being used to help fight the war against cancer after researchers discovered they could detect cancer cells through unique polarised vision			1
researchers from the @entity8 are now duplicating the shrimps ' eyes to cameras that will help diagnose cancer by detecting polarised light			0
professor @entity13 from @entity8 's @entity14 said the finding could provide diagnostic benefits since cancerous tissue reflects polarised light differently to healthy tissue			2
@entity1 ' eyes are now being used to help fight the war against cancer after researchers discovered their vision could detect cancer cells ' what we can do is use that to specifically design cameras to look for polarisation contrasts and it turns out that one of the things that do contrast in polarisation is cancerous cells '			1
he said the new camera will focus on polarised light , the @entity33 reported			0
professor @entity13 insists humans and animals both have different ways of viewing the world and believes it is important to ' get in the head of another animal '			1
he said this type of work will provide researchers information that can only be seen by certain species and said it was like ' seeing the invisible '			0
researchers from the @entity8 are now duplicating the shrimps ' eyes to diagnostic cameras , in the hope to better detect polarised light ' we 're a colour - vision animal and we look at things in colour , so we notice a red apple in a green tree for instance			1
' other animals actually do this , but in polarisation '			0
this polarisation , which was particularly found in shrimps , also offers a new perspective in image brain activity and nerve cells			0
professor @entity13 said the findings challenges evolution and highlights the vast amount of information that have not been discovered			2
the technology is being developed by researchers from @entity75 , the @entity71 and the @entity72			0
