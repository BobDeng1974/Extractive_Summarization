a 3d printing company has created a prosthetic leg for a goose after it was left struggling for self confidence following an amputation			1
@entity6 the goose was close to being put down numerous times after he broke his leg and it was amputated at the joint			1
but an animal lover 's appeal for help led to a @entity14 tech company stepping in to manufacture him a brand new limb			1
@entity6 the goose has his stump measurements taken as @entity19 works to design him a new leg @entity6 's new 3d printed leg ( pictured ) was designed in the shape and size of a goose leg to fit him perfectly @entity25 , director of @entity19 , said it was a few weeks ago when his company ' got word of a goose with a situation '			1
he said : ' he broke his leg and it had to be amputated at the joint			2
' he was lucky as animal lover and rescuer @entity33 got hold of him and started nursing him back to health			1
as time went by he struggled more and more to cope with only one leg resulting in damaged wings and self confidence			0
' they considered ending his struggle many times but always decided not to			0
' out of desperation , @entity33 managed to get onto the national radio station here and called ( @entity14 broadcaster ) @entity46 in the hope someone would hear their plea and be able to assist them somehow			2
' @entity52 from 3d printing systems contacted me a few days later telling me about someone who is looking for help , as she normally sends us medical related queries			0
the prosthetic limb is composed of several parts and replacement pieces which comprise his new leg after creating specific design files , a 3d printer was used to manufacture the new limb ( pictured ) ' we soon discovered that it was the same person from the radio			1
we contacted @entity33 and told her we would look into it and see if we can get something off the ground			0
' mr @entity25 then gathered up sponsors to help fund what is believed to be the first 3d - printed prosthetic limb for an animal in @entity14			1
he added : ' @entity33 brought the goose to the @entity19 offices where we took photos and took measurements of the goose 's leg			1
we explained to them the process and what we had planned and then set a date for the test			0
' we started working and came up with a few possible solutions , we are by no means experts on animal prosthetic but we do work with human prosthetic and this did give us some insight on what should work			0
' the @entity96 ( computer - aided design ) files where then sent to @entity99 to be @entity100 printed and finished			0
' we got together on the 3rd of april and did a fitting test on the goose , the parts fitted perfectly but he was a bit confused about his new leg as he has been without one for about five months			0
' he will need some therapy to assist him and close monitoring for a few days			0
we can then re-look the design and see if any improvements can be made before we 3d print the final product			2
' @entity6 the goose is able to fly short distances again after the replacement limb allowed him to properly land			2

@entity6 the goose has been given a new leg manufactured using a 3d printer
he broke his leg and had it amputated before being nursed back to health
but he was unable to fly and struggling for self confidence after operation
rescuer @entity33 made an appeal on *public* radio for help with @entity6
tech company @entity19 stepped in to @entity100 print him a new prosthetic limb
