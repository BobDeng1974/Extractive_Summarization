by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 09:44 est , 3 september 2012 controversial : a new rival book titled @entity2 alleges that @entity3 , who wrote @entity3 , could have been motivated by revenge on @entity6 he claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed @entity10			1
but the @entity11 who wrote the first hand account of the mission could actually have been motivated by revenge - on his own comrades			0
a rival book alleges that @entity3 , who wrote ‘ no @entity3 ’ , had ‘ bad blood ’ between his former colleagues and commanders because he was kicked out of the unit			1
‘ no @entity2 ’ claims that the soldier was ‘ ostracized ’ when he inquired about leaving the @entity11 to start a business and was sent home suddenly before quitting			0
feeling scorned @entity26 could have penned his novel as a way of getting back at the military in which he served for 14 years with distinction			2
no @entity3 , which is due out tomorrow , is the first account of the @entity10 operation from a member of the squad who was there			1
but it has proved controversial because @entity26 , writing under the pseudonym @entity38 , did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it			0
it also disagrees with the official @entity42 version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the @entity46 administration consternation			0
according to the @entity48 , the book says that @entity26 was ‘ repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service ’ with nothing but rejection			2
the rival book claims that @entity26 , seen in this photo talking to tv show 60 minutes about the @entity10 @entity58 raid , was rejected by his comrades after he inquired about leaving the @entity11 to start a business it claims he was ‘ ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to @entity65 from a training operation ’ , before eventually leaving			1
the book says : ‘ in the infantry - bred world of @entity71 special operations , no one wants to hear braggarts telling tall tales of their heroics , ’ commando : a photo purported to be of @entity3 was published by @entity77 last thursday no @entity2 has been written by @entity78 , a web site for former @entity81 team members			1
@entity82 , a former @entity11 sniper who founded the site , said that the book was the product of conversations he and others had with serving members of the @entity10 team , although none of them are identified			1
talking to the @entity48 , mr @entity82 refused to say whether @entity26 was involved in @entity92 , even though he has spoken to him in the past			2
watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity10 's compound , the @entity95 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity46 mission : the @entity95 leader was killed at this compound in @entity104 by @entity105 - and @entity106 claims that if @entity6 had never made it there they were to explain that they were searching for an unmanned drone to their @entity58 allies tension : the raid of @entity10 's @entity104 compound was watched by president @entity46 and his closest advisers in the @entity116 of the @entity42 in a statement , @entity117 , one of the co-authors of @entity3 said : ‘ after spending several very intense months working with @entity38 on this book , i know that he wrote this book solely to share a story about the incredible men and women defending @entity125 all over the world			1
‘ any suggestion otherwise is as ill informed as it is inaccurate			0
‘ what ’s more , @entity38 has an unshakable respect for the @entity125 military , in particular the men he served with			0
‘ that ’s why not one negative word was written about anyone he served with			0
’ this undated file photo shows @entity95 leader @entity10 , in @entity137			0
a firsthand account of the @entity11 raid that killed @entity10 contradicts previous accounts , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when @entity11 first fired upon him			2
