by @entity1 reporter @entity2 may be in the grip of an unrelenting civil war with its murderous regime facing the threat of impending @entity8 intervention , yet on the @entity10 ’s @entity9 account the county ’s first lady is attempting to paint a very different picture of her county			1
the social media platform is being used by the regime as a sickening propaganda tool as they attempt to sell a lie to the outside world that all is well			0
the main stooge in this shameless pr exercise is the president ’s wife @entity23 who it seems is all too willing to try and mask the horrific atrocities being carried out by her husband ’s forces			0
shameless propaganda : the @entity32 government posted this photo op , left , featuring the country ’s first lady on wednesday , while in reality men inspect a site hit by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to @entity2 's president @entity41 different worlds : this photo of the president and his wife was posted on the @entity10 ’s @entity9 account on july 30 , the same day that @entity41 ’s forces carried out this attack in the @entity50 neighbourhood of @entity51 even as photographic evidence emerges from the country showing what @entity41 ’s regime are doing to his people , the @entity53 account attempts to sell an alternative version of events where the president ’s wife is photographed smiling as she hugs old women and ladles out soup to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers			1
in reality the photographs show that @entity69 - born @entity23 has become a @entity71 figure , completely out of touch with what is really going on in the country			1
in some photographs recently posted on @entity9 , she is shown wearing a new blue @entity76 on her right wrist – a device designed to help wearers keep track of how many steps they take and calories they burn			0
the @entity9 account was opened in july in what an apparent attempt to win back favor across the globe , but it did n't take long before it backfired			1
in a tasteless photo op : @entity23 ladles out soup to starving refugees wearing her expensive exercise bracelet in this august 4 photo , while the same day a boy stands next to a barricade set up by the @entity95 in @entity96 no one smiles : @entity69 - born @entity23 reaches out to a clearly uncomfortable girl on august 11 , while elsewhere in @entity2 a woman carrying a bag of bread exits a bakery run by the @entity104 rebel group ‘ @entity103 ’ the staged publicity shots are fooling very few and although some users have comment on @entity109 's ' beautiful soul , ' the majority are less forgiving			1
' i love ur designer clothes and shoes ... paid for by the blood of your people ! seriously , u make @entity71 look like an angel compared to you ! , ' wrote one @entity9 user			1
others comment on the ' hypocrisy ' of @entity109 being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two - year @entity32 war			2
to date , more than 100,000 men , women and children have been killed and nearly two million @entity32 have fled the country since the conflict started in march 2011 but as millions have fled the fighting to neighboring states , the @entity32 regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life - as - normal image for the president and his family			2
president @entity41 attempts to maintain an air of respectability on july 28 , while at the same time his forces patrol in the battle - scarred @entity142 neighborhood of the central city of @entity144 @entity23 has become a @entity71 figure out of touch with what is really going on			0
she is pictured on @entity9 embracing an old woman on july 31 , while a member of the @entity95 carries an injured civilian after shelling by forces loyal to her husband on the same day @entity153 , deputy director for @entity154 in the @entity155 and @entity156 , said @entity158 's @entity9 account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed @entity162 president @entity161 and @entity164 dictator @entity163			1
he said : ' i think it is a generational thing , i am not aware older leaders like @entity161 and @entity163 used social networking , but the @entity32 regime has always been keen to show a business - like image to the world			0
' i am not surprised by this account , but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs , arbitrary arrests , human rights abuses and violence			2
' @entity41 is not going to show the millions of people displaced , it 's not going to show attacks on civilians			0
' photo opportunity : @entity23 hands out supplies in this july 24 @entity9 image , while boys look at a pool of blood belonging to one of ten victims of shelling at @entity195 carried out by forces loyal to her husband on the very same day the @entity32 @entity10 ’s @entity9 account attempts to portray an alternative reality where @entity41 appears presidential such as in this august 8 photo , but meanwhile a @entity95 fighter uses a mirror to monitor the movements of the president 's forces elsewhere as the civil war rages on @entity2 campaign manager , @entity208 , said : ' on one level you 'd have to say that it 's not surprising to find any government , even the rigid and oppressive one in @entity51 , using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view			1
' image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in president @entity41 's " love me or i 'll kill you " strategy			0
' naturally , we 'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in @entity2 - of the torture chambers or places of execution			2
seeing the @entity231 in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that @entity32 government hospitals have been used as places of torture			0
' no amount of photos or tweets or @entity241 posts will ever wash away the stain on the @entity32 government 's record			2
' façade : president @entity41 's arrival at @entity247 with representatives of the @entity249 august 5 , left , while vegetable vendors rest against a bus - turned barricade with visible entrances of sniper bullets			0

the @entity32 @entity10 's @entity9 account *churns* out tasteless photo ops featuring first lady @entity23
the propaganda images attempt to portray a very different @entity2 to the grim reality faced by the country 's people
