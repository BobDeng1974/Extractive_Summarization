by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 06:04 est , 18 june 2013 it looks like a typical @entity3 wooden starter home			0
and with just two bedrooms and a single bathroom spread over its modest 960 sq / ft living space , there 's hardly enough living space for even the smallest family			2
yet this unprepossessing 70 - year - old bungalow at 353 @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , is on the market for a wallet - busting $ 1.1million ( £ 700,000 )			0
the reason ? it 's less than ten minutes ' drive from the headquarters of online search and advertising giant @entity22			1
modestly extravagant : the unprepossessing bungalow at 353 @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , which is on the market for a massive $ 1.1million because it 's so close to search giant @entity22 's headquarters who lives in a house like this ? well , no - one at the moment			1
but the tiny two - bedroom bungalow is likely to be snapped up by a @entity22 software engineer - or by a canny landlord hoping to rent it to one of them just an average middle - class @entity3 suburb ... the area 's property prices have risen in line with tech stocks property website @entity41 boasts that the ' charming cottage ' has just been completely renovated			1
but the million dollar asking price is not going on the bamboo floors and remodelled kitchen			0
what potential buyers will be paying for is the privilege of living in @entity12 , where property values have soared as @entity52 stock prices have exploded			1
and although reliable figures are hard to find , @entity22 is reputed to lead the pack in doling out the big bucks to its software engineers and designers , with even interns earning a massive $ 6,000 a month			0
the £ 300billion dollar company 's @entity60 headquarters also offers a range of on - site perks to employees , so that they need not even spend a penny of their healthy salaries on outside entertainments			1
so it 's no suprise that the internet giant allegedly receives a resume every 25 seconds from job - seekers eager to join the @entity52 gravy train			2
recently renovated : the front door of the bungalow opens into this living room with just - laid bamboo floors open plan living : a view of the living room from the opposite angle shows how it extends into the kitchen all mod cons : the kitchen boasts granite worktops , plenty of cupboards and stylish brushed metal appliances for those plaid short - sleeve shirts : although on a @entity22 salary you could probably afford a service wash this is where the magic happens ... although it probably takes place via webcam deceptively spacious : the property 's bathroom makes clever use of the limited space available the washroom : because just one bathroom is never enough these days , the developers have added a half one however , that puts the ordinary , @entity108 working residents of towns like @entity12 in a difficult position			1
' there are more new money millionaires ride - sharing across @entity13 than ever before , ' explains @entity114 's @entity113			2
they might dig the modesty of [ a ] quiet residential plot			0
they might want @entity121 , not ostentation			0
' this is n't a problem if you 're a well - to - do software engineer , but for the rest of humanity , you 're suddenly priced out			0
' and the situation is only likely to get more difficult			0
@entity41 predicts that @entity12 house prices are likely to rise a further 7 per cent next year .			1

@entity132 house is less than ten minutes drive from the @entity60
' @entity135 ' has just been completely renovated , estate agent says
@entity138 's property values have soared with tech stock prices
but ordinary residents are being priced out by *influx* of rich *programmers*
