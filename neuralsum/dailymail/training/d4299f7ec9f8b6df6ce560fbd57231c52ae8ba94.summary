for most mothers , the moment when they first see their child after giving birth is filled with love and affection			2
but for @entity8 , it was a moment of terror - for her son had been born with half of his face missing			1
the 33 - year - old had given birth to twin boys @entity16 and @entity17 - but doctors discovered baby @entity17 had been born with a severe facial deformity			1
@entity16 and @entity17 are the best of friends - with @entity16 fiercely protective of his brother @entity8 , with son @entity17 , says that initially it took her years before she could love him mrs @entity8 , from @entity24 , recalled how , when her sons were born seven years ago , she kept apologising to husband @entity26 after hearing the news			1
she said : ' i 'd only just recovered from giving birth by caesarian to the twins			0
' doctors had whisked @entity17 straight off after his birth and i had n't been able to see him			1
' the doctor lifted his hand to his own face , and made a sweeping gesture across the left side			1
" ' it 's as though his face has been erased completely , " he told me			1
he has no eye on that side , no ear or nostril			1
' ' i started crying and kept saying i was sorry to @entity26			0
i felt like it was my fault			0
@entity8 and her two sons @entity17 and @entity16 have overcome other people 's prejudices and are a loving , close family @entity8 says a turning point came when @entity17 was 18th months old , and she explained to staring children about her son 's condition ' i saw him the following morning and i was so shocked			1
' half of his face was missing , it just was n’t there			1
it was like it had been rubbed out			0
' as i cuddled him for the first time , waves of terror swept over me			0
how could i possibly love this little boy when he looked like this ? ' people assume that maternal instinct kicks in as soon as you hold your child for the first time			2
' but mine did n’t			0
i did n’t feel anything , just emptiness			0
i fixed a smile on my face , but behind the smile , i was in pieces			2
' i just could n’t love my son when he looked like this			1
instead i just felt grief - grief for a life that i felt had been taken from me , a normal life that should have been @entity17 's			1
' the @entity80 had been thrilled when they had found out @entity8 was pregnant with twins			1
at 32 weeks , mrs @entity8 's waters broke and she had to have an emergency caesarian to deliver the boys as @entity16 was in a breech position			1
the boys were born weighing @entity87 each , and they were taken off by doctors to assess them			2
it was four hours later when doctors returned and explained to them about @entity17 's condition			1
the @entity80 says occasionally adults stare and whisper and sometimes children scream and run away from @entity17 @entity8 , pictured with @entity17 , says that she felt grief for @entity17 , who she says was robbed of a normal life the pair are now firm friends and @entity16 defends @entity17 from anyone who thoughtlessly stares of points the baby was transferred to @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , where scans ruled out any kidney , spine or heart problems and stayed under medical care before he was allowed home			1
now , seven years later , mrs @entity8 has overcome the dread and sadness she felt when she first heard the news about @entity17			1
her sons are energetic , adorable and the best of friends - with @entity16 fiercely protective of his twin brother			0
and she has learned to overcome her initial horror at her son , and accept him for the loveable , brave boy that he is			2
' i just went through the motions with him , feeding and changing him			0
but still i could n’t feel anything for him			0
' and i could n’t bring myself to take them out in the double buggy			0
' the occasional time that i did dare to venture out , the double buggy attracted attention			0
people came over to ask about the twins , and when they saw @entity17 , some even ran away screaming			1
' it took me a long time to start loving my little boy			0
it was two years before i finally loved him properly , like i ’d always imagined that i would love my children			1
' i gradually came to accept what he looked like			0
' the turning point came for me when he was 18 months old and i took the twins out to @entity147 shopping			0
' as soon as i walked in the store , children came running up to look at the twins , and i felt like the @entity151 as i walked through the store with them behind me , staring and pointing			2
@entity17 has had three operations on his face , and is due to have a prosthetic eye fitted this year the @entity80 say that @entity16 and @entity17 are close , and @entity17 will always have @entity16 to rely upon ' i ’d had enough			1
it was time to help @entity17 face the world			1
i swung the buggy round			0
' " this is @entity17 , " i said			1
the children asked what was wrong with him			2
and afterwards i felt stronger			0
' instead of trying to hide my son away , i ’d faced it head on , and i felt better			2
' from then on i got more confident taking the twins out			0
it still is n’t easy			0
' i ca n’t predict how people are going to react to him			0
adults stare and whisper and sometimes children scream and run away from him			1
' the boys are firm friends , and @entity16 stands up to anyone who stares or makes comments about @entity17 , mrs @entity8 said : ' it is difficult for @entity16 to deal with and my heart goes out to him			1
recently we were a child ’s attraction in @entity181 and i heard @entity16 say to a group of children " he ’s my brother			2
it does n’t matter what he looks like "			0
' it breaks my heart to hear him			0
i ’m pleased that @entity17 will always have @entity16 there to help him through , but it ’s a lot for @entity16 to take on			2
' it has knocked his self confidence , but he ’s so protective of his brother			0
i ’m very proud of them both			0
' @entity17 has had three operations on his face , to reposition his eye socket and in july last year he had a ten - hour operation at @entity198 in @entity199 to remove the front of his face and skull and to reposition his brain			1
this year he is due to have his eyelid stretched and a prosthetic eye fitted			2
' @entity17 and i have such a close relationship now			2
' i ’ve got no shame in admitting that i could n’t love my son when he was born			1
' i do n’t want people to think that it ’s easy to love a child straight away like this			0
' but i want my story to give hope to other mums who may find themselves in my position			0
' because do n’t give up hope - i ’ve learned to accept @entity17 ’s deformity and the love i have for both my sons is so strong			1
