glory : @entity21 from @entity22 lifted the inaugural @entity2 last season ‘ but the one time they were due to come to us there was an outbreak of mumps at @entity5 and the fixture was called off			1
’ @entity5 lost only once last season and so , understandably , @entity26 is keen to face them on home turf			1
‘ it ’s a great game to start the season			0
we expect another good contest , ’ @entity26 said			0
@entity5 and @entity15 are among the pack out to stop @entity21 , who went 12 games unbeaten last season			1

but we still expect to be competitive			0
we have some good players coming through and some very promising teams further down			0
’ @entity5 - @entity53 : ‘ we went on tour to @entity55 in the summer and it provided exactly the sort of rugby we wanted			1

’ @entity60 - @entity59 : ‘ we ’ve had five or six good seasons now so we ’ve set the standards high			2
we expect to do well and hope to be very competitive , but there some good teams around and you always expect tough games			0
’ @entity15 - @entity26 : ‘ we have a hard working group which has been bolstered by some very good players from our under 16 squad			2
we have a tough fixture list so let ’s see how we get on			0
’ @entity73 - @entity72 : ‘ it ’s looking like a transition season for us and we are not as big			2

@entity78 will be the key			0
’ @entity80 - @entity79 : ‘ we are looking to have a strong squad			2
a lot of the players from the lower sixth gained good experience last season and are ready to step up			0
' pedigree : @entity17 - based @entity15 helped nurture @entity88 stars @entity19 ( pictured ) and @entity20 to cap that success @entity89 completed a national double by capturing the schools ’ 20 - 20 cricket title			1
this year , however , they will field a new - look team with 10 or 11 new faces due to pupils moving on			1
grove should know if they have a title - challenging squad by the end of september , as their opening games are against two of @entity106 ’s strongest schools - @entity104 and @entity107			2
