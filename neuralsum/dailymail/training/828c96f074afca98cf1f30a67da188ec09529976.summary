police described the violence , which took place on may 26 last year , as a ' major disorder '			0
@entity60 , a spokesman for @entity12 , said : ' this appears to have been a major incident of disorder and we are keen to identify anyone who was involved			0
' we will not stand for this type of behaviour in @entity9 and therefore we are releasing a number of @entity32 images today in the hope the public can help us identify some of the individuals shown on the stills			1
' we would ask anyone who identifies any of the men captured on the footage to contact us as soon as possible , but it is probably worth noting that we suspect that some of the individuals involved in this disorder were not local to @entity9			1
' we believe one of the groups involved in this disorder contained men from elsewhere in the @entity86 and therefore we would ask people from outside @entity9 to study these images too			1
