by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 when @entity4 arrive at the @entity5 in @entity6 on saturday , the magnitude of what liesahead will hit them			1
as will the heat — and humidity			2
@entity10 ’s men can expect temperatures of around 32 degrees when they face @entity12 , as well as humidity levels of 76 per cent			1
so , in search of a realistic idea of what @entity17 will be forced to endure against the @entity19 , i made my way to @entity21			2
getting ready : @entity22 's @entity0 prepares to tackle the @entity24 conditions fitness test entering : @entity0 takes to the pitch and immediately feels the 32 degree heat in the mix : sami on the pitch ready to test the same heat @entity4 players will play in at the @entity32 not particularly tropical , you might say			1
but @entity24 ’s @entity34 has brought a taste of the @entity37 rainforest to east @entity38			2
the temporary indoor facility , which has its own @entity41 pitch , replicates the temperature and humidity in @entity37 — in this case @entity24			2
the plan was to complete the @entity46 — a 10 - minute intensive endurance test which incorporates work with a football — before going into a small - sided game			1
in preparation , on - site specialists checked my weight and hydration levels			0
and then it hits you square in the face — the heat			0
as you walk into the @entity60 , it ’s like stepping into a sauna			0
within seconds , i was sweating — and that was before i had even started			0
not to be boastful , i like to think i ’m pretty fit			0
i exercise at least five times a week and watch my diet			0
but nothing could prepare me for what was to come			0
the @entity46 is a series of runs , sprints and jumps with and without the ball			0
five minutes in , i was gasping for air , desperate for the second half of the test to pass			1
you try not to slow down , but you ca n’t help but take your foot off the gas			0
it felt like my lungs would burst if i did n’t			0
@entity0 : ' it hits you square in the face - the heat			1
as you walk into the @entity60 , it 's like stepping into a sauna			1
' getting going : @entity0 did a series of runs , sprints and jumps with and without the ball to test himself in the heat by the end i was drenched in sweat , gasping for air with legs like jelly			1
utterly exhausted — and that was after 10 minutes			1
the main thing that struck me was my lack of control over the ball as time wore on			0
@entity102 - zagging in and out of cones during the first two or three minutes was fine , but the quality with the ball at my feet gradually plummeted			2
you try to ensure that your touches are assured , but all i could really think about was : ‘ when can i stop ? ’ @entity109 came the small - sided game			0
it was only 10 minutes , but after the @entity46 it was 10 minutes too long			1
the final tests : @entity0 says ' the final whistle was a sweet , sweet sound ' after a tormenting challenge pacing myself was the key here , but shaking off what went before was easier said than done			1
the speed of the game dropped dramatically towards the end , every player petrified that a misplaced pass would lead to an unnecessary burst of speed to retrieve the ball			0
the final whistle was a sweet , sweet sound , as was the moment i stepped out of the @entity129 and into the east @entity38 air			2
i lost a kilo in weight and 1.5 litres of fluid in just 20 minutes			2
so what effect will 90 minutes of play in the @entity135 at @entity6 , chasing 11 @entity19 , have on @entity4 on saturday ? the weigh - in : @entity0 lost a kilo in weight and 1.5 litres of fluid in just 20 minutes in the heat results : how will @entity4 players fare after 90 minutes of chasing 11 @entity19 on saturday ?			1

@entity22 's @entity0 was ' gasping for air ' after just 10 minutes
@entity4 can expect temperatures of about 32 degrees in their @entity32 opener against @entity12 on june *14*
