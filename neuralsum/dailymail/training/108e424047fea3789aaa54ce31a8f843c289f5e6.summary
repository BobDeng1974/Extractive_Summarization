by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 would be happy to lift a @entity3 can above his head at next month 's @entity6 @entity5 providing it is engraved with the word ' first '			1
after collecting an unusual runner - up trophy after sunday 's @entity10 , in a more light - hearted moment post race at the @entity12 , @entity2 bemoaned the bizarre designs of current @entity15 silverware			1
but in turning his attention to his home race at @entity18 on july 6 , a race he is naturally desperate to win for a variety of reasons , all @entity2 cares about is he is on the top step of the podium			1
second : @entity2 criticised the strange trophy he won in @entity25 but says he 'll take anything that says first @entity27 : @entity2 has been behind his team - mate @entity28 too often this season , and needs to start winning it is now six years since his one - and - only victory on home soil , and with the gap at the top of the drivers ' standings to title rival and @entity39 team - mate @entity28 now 29 points , @entity2 knows he has to stop the @entity42 's run in front of his own fans			1
' generally , @entity15 trophies are n't very good			1
i was looking back at 2003 and the trophies were awesome			2
the last few years ... ' sighed @entity2			1
' @entity18 has a good one , but they do n't give it out			1
you use it and then you give it back			0
' but at the end of the day it really does n't matter what it ( the winner 's trophy ) looks like , so long as it has ' first ' on it			2
' it could be an old tin can , or a @entity3 can with ' first ' on it , it really would not matter			0
' for @entity18 i can not really explain how special it would be to win there again			1
it has been a long time since i did , but when i did it was just unbelievable			2
' in 2007 ( his debut year ) being on pole , that was just such a unique experience			0
' you really feel like everyone is with you , like you are doing it together , which is really a strange feeling			0
@entity74 moment : @entity2 was on the podium again in @entity25 , but knows he has to win at @entity18 long wait : the former @entity77 has n't won on home soil for six years ' then when i won in 2008 ( in the wet ) , coming through the chicane where people were aquaplaning and going off , i could see the crowds getting up and cheering			1
' from the corner of my eye i could still see them cheering , and you never want to disappoint them			0
' in some races , when you go there and you do n't get the result , they are still so supportive afterwards , telling me ' do n't worry , next time '			1
' i am really confident i can do it this year			0
i have the car so there is no reason - and @entity28 's not the reason - why we should not be able to do it			1
' it 's coming at the right time			0
i have had a couple of dodgy races , so i need to get it back to how it should be			0
' two retirements for @entity105 , in the opening race in @entity107 and earlier this month in @entity108 , have left him playing catch up with @entity28 who has not been out of the top two in the eight races to date			2
it is slowly getting to the point where @entity2 requires @entity28 's car to suffer a technical glitch of its own to aid his title cause			1
in the pits : @entity2 has suffered two dnfs this season , leaving him behind his team - mate in the championship @entity123 , however , would prefer to suggest it is fortune that has so far been lacking			2
' i do n't hope for anything			0
i just need some luck to go my way as i have been unfortunate with the two @entity128 ( did not finish ) i 've had , ' added @entity2			2
' saturday ( in qualifying ) was only my first real mistake of the year , so if that was a bad weekend , to still get a 1 - 2 ...			0
you just have to step back			0
' you can be angry , but i have never had a car like this where i can fight so well with people , follow people and really be in the race			0
' it 's incredible what this team have done , and i always need to just step back and be grateful to be a part of it			0
' there is still a long way to go , a lot of races , so i really need to pull my socks up and capitalise on my own pace , to use that at the weekends otherwise @entity28 will have it ( the title )			2
