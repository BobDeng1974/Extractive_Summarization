a 95 - year - old man 's arm was elevated using a carrier bag and later a pillowcase after nurses struggled to find a specialised medical sling			1
after waiting for 12 hours on a trolley at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity7 's family were told staff would have to use a carrier bag to secure his arm			1
when he was transferred to another ward , an orthopaedic doctor replaced the bag with a pillowcase , to help drain mr @entity7 's arm of excess fluid			1
mr @entity7 's daughter , @entity20 , who said she was forced to go and buy a sling herself , has branded her father 's treatment an ' outrage '			1
@entity7 , 95 , had his arm elevated using a pillowcase , left , and plastic carrier bag , right , at @entity9 in @entity10 , after medics told his family there were no specialised slings available ms @entity20 said : ' it is outrageous that staff are so stretched they could n't even get a sling for a 95 - year - old man			1
' in the end i was so frustrated that i went and bought one myself for £ 39.99			0
' but the hospital said the temporary slings were used to ensure the 95 - year - old 's medical needs were met and that he was not left in pain			1
mr @entity7 fell at his home in @entity43 in the @entity44 on february 11			2
he was found on the floor by a district nurse , who had visited the diabetic 95 - year - old to give him his insulin			0
the nurse took him straight to @entity50 at @entity9			2
there , medics told his family he needed a sling after they diagnosed compartment syndrome - a painful , and potentially serious condition caused by swelling and bleeding in a bundle of muscles			1
the condition is thought to have been caused by the pressure of mr @entity7 lying on his arm all night			1
medics said he needed his arm elevating to reduce the swelling and help drain the built - up fluid away			1
but his daughter claims staff ' could n't find one ( a sling ) so they used a triangular bandage combined with a green carrier bag '			1
she said : ' later when he was moved to a different ward - diabetic ward @entity68 - they tried using a pillow case			0
' his daughter @entity20 , claims she was forced to buy a traditional sling , pictured , branding her father 's treatment an ' outrage ' ms @entity20 claims her father still had n't been given a specialised sling a week later , prompting her to take matters into her own hands			1
she went to buy a sling herself , at a cost of £ 39.99			2
' his arm needed to be fixed at a specific angle to his shoulder and so a normal sling was n't enough , ' she said			2
' so to find out that they were still using a plastic bag and a pillow case a week later was awful			2
' it was n't comfortable and he appeared to be in so much pain			0
' @entity95 is fiercely independent and he lives in his own home			0
and at the moment it 's been taken away from him			0
' he 's normally very with it but at the time he was so disorientated that i do n't think he could protest			0
' it 's fortunate that my sister and i are there to look after him but so many other people are completely alone and do n't have someone who can go and buy them the equipment they need			2
' i 'm no medic but he is still in pain and his arm does n't appear to have improved at all			0
' i feel that the delay in this could have slowed down the recovery to his arm			0
' a spokesman for the @entity114 , which runs @entity9 , said the trust 's head of nursing @entity117 has personally apologised to mr @entity7			1
' with no @entity120 sling in stock and to keep the patient comfortable while elevating his arm , staff on both wards used improvised slings and pillows , ' he said			2
' on ward @entity129 a temporary sling was made using a bag because it was cleanable and met hospital infection control standards			1
' it was then replaced with a pillow case sling by an orthopaedic doctor on ward @entity68			0
' this is a widely used and accepted practice to provide elevation			1
an alternative sling was then sourced from the fracture clinic which the patient is now using			0
' at no time was the patient uncomfortable and his medical needs were met at all times			0
an incident report has been filed and any lessons learned will be shared with colleagues			0
' the trust has agreed to reimburse the family the cost of the two @entity120 slings which they purchased			0
