at the @entity3 monastery in @entity4 , the ancient @entity1 monk lit a fragrant stick and sprinkled herbs into a phial of holy water			1
his rumbling mantra sounded like a stream running over a bed of pebbles			1
' drink , ' said @entity13 , our @entity15 guide			1
the priest poured liquid into my cupped palms			1
i swallowed the brackish concoction and grimaced			1
' he says there is too much going on in your head			1
my head had been spinning and after a week of no sleep and rampaging blood pressure , my friend @entity27 persuaded me to seek holy help			1
the problem , i thought , was to do with high altitude and a lack of wine with dinner			1
the high life : the @entity38 monastery sits atop a hillside in @entity4 but i left the @entity38 monastery with a spring in my stride and marched up the steep slope to @entity43 to see the chemist			1
it was the first time i had n't had to stop and catch my breath			1
' i ca n't believe this , ' he said , as he put his stethoscope away and handed me a handwritten bill for 23p			2
' last night your blood pressure was 160 over 130 , now it 's normal			2
' little surprise , perhaps , in an area famous for levitating @entity1 magi			2
i strode up the @entity58 road to the @entity59 at the top of @entity61 , past the beggars and monkeys , the prayer bells and flags			2
below me , the verdant @entity67 foothills			1
back at the verandah of the @entity71 hotel , we watched the sun slide slowly behind the ridge of @entity74			2
then the clouds parted to reveal the snowcapped summit of @entity77			2
tea time : a picker at work in the fields the world 's third - highest mountain was bathed in golden light as @entity85 the waiter arrived with a chilled bottle of @entity88			1
i was , at last , at one with this strange new world			2
the great tea town of @entity4 is perched 7,000 ft up in the @entity92 sector of the @entity67 foothills and still has splendid remnants of the last days of the @entity95			1
the @entity71 was built in 1887 as a summer retreat for the @entity97 of @entity98 and is a living celebration of a bygone era , when @entity4 was @entity101 of the @entity102			2
here the top brass from @entity104 retreated en masse during the summer from @entity106			2
it still oozes @entity109 opulence			0
more than can be said for the @entity110 , which grinds its way up and down to @entity112 ( and all the way to the plains of @entity115 , once the line is fixed )			0
we went up to @entity74 , to the railway museum and the @entity120 monastery , where we spun the prayer wheels , passing within feet of rickety stalls selling fish , meat , mangoes and vegetables			0
the 2ft - guage ' toy train ' is a @entity129 choo - choo and has been wheezing its way from the plains into the foothills , to its 7,500 - ft high point , since 1881			1
from its carriages you get a glimpse into local life , as it weaves between beasts , shacks and people			0
at @entity4 's @entity142 , i could n't resist touching the @entity144 flag planted by sir @entity145 on the summit of @entity147 61 years ago			0
you can see the kit they wore — sherpa @entity151 's crampons look like medieval torture implements			0
it is a moving celebration of man 's insuperable instinct to conquer			0
@entity158 era : the @entity110 grinds its way down to @entity112 the potholed roads here require a local driver and short journeys can take a long time			0
one of the high points was a 30 - mile drive to @entity165 , on the @entity166 between @entity104 and @entity167			0
@entity168 commands views into @entity170 and @entity171 , across the valley where the rivers @entity174 and @entity175 join before flowing into the @entity176			0
tea is , of course , the main business and we visited @entity181 , suppliers to @entity183 , and the @entity184 , where 1,500 women pluck the delicate leaves and stamens to make the white , black , green and oolong teas that command high prices around the world			1
the finest grow above 4,000 feet			0
finest selection : women carry their baskets through the fields of tea in @entity181 no trip to the hill stations would be complete without at least one night in the old capital of @entity106			1
the driver dropped us in front of @entity203 's house , where the @entity204 carry out their work			0
nearby is the @entity206 , a treasure trove of western art boasting @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and a 10ft statue of @entity101 @entity214			0
we retreated to the air - conditioned splendour of the @entity217 hotel , where a tea wallah served up another wonderful brew			1
' i have fallen in love , ' said @entity27			0
i knew exactly what she meant			0
