this time last year at @entity2 we sat four points clear at the top of @entity5 , but it got mentioned on several occasions that the players looked edgy , nervous and were playing with fear			0
on wednesday night i was at @entity11 , kindly invited by @entity12 for @entity14 's game against @entity15			1
the fans sung their hearts out , they appealed for every decision , they lauded every tackle			0
but the more they did that , the more passes went astray and the less the players moved with the speed and fluidity they are used to			0
wobbling : @entity25 celebrates after pulling one back against @entity14 on wednesday evening enough : @entity26 and @entity12 ( right ) celebrate after @entity14 just got over the line back in top form : @entity29 netted @entity14 's fourth goal against @entity31 on sunday the wobbles had set in at @entity11			1
they managed to hang on for the victory , but were not jumping for joy			0
it was sighs of relief to get three more points on the table			0
it happens at all levels and you ca n't do anything about it , but you get better at dealing with it and taking the pressure off your players as much as you can			2
@entity49 got the wobbles when they slipped up against @entity51 on saturday			0
when i talk to my players i always use the example of @entity55 at the @entity56 when we see what happens to the world 's very best golfers			2
we sit , with our feet tucked up on the sofa , watching them hook and slice , duffing chips and fluffing putts on the billiard table greens			0
wobbling ? @entity68 dropped points at @entity70 on saturday afternoon back of the net : @entity72 nods the ball into his own net against @entity51 but @entity14 did anything but wobble as they took apart @entity31 to move top of the table			2
that 's the 20th time the lead has changed hands this season			1
there will be plenty more twists and turns through to the end of the season though , as the jelly wobbles set in			2
@entity87 how pathetic and idiotic can you get , hiring an aeroplane with a negative message about @entity91 ? after every game all everyone talks about nowadays is when @entity91 will get the sack and that everyone wants him out			1
yes , he has made mistakes			0
yes , he has made errors in the transfer market			0
but he 's taken over from the most successful and longest - serving manager in world football			1
the shadow of sir @entity102 and how he did things will be looming large all over @entity104 and and in every corner at @entity106 , day in and day out			1
golden boy : @entity108 netted twice for @entity109 against @entity110 at @entity104 point taken : @entity91 ' @entity109 side battered the @entity113 4 - 1 at @entity104 standing strong : there has been mounting pressure to take down the ' @entity116 ' banner unhelpful : fans commissioned a banner calling for @entity91 ' job to fly over the ground on match day it will take a couple of years for @entity91 to put his own imprint on the whole club and it will take him time to adjust from managing a big club like @entity128 to managing a global institution like @entity109			1
at least the real fans showed their support by applauding @entity91 on to the pitch at @entity104 and booing the plane			1
what better way to reward them than with a 4 - 1 win against @entity110			2
@entity137 , @entity138 the supporters at @entity140 were also having a go at their manager @entity142 despite winning a game			1
i must admit i was not there to see it , but i read that the performance against @entity148 that evening was not good			0
after three defeats and the teams at the bottom catching up , the only important thing is to win , whether it be with pretty passing triangles or 11 behind the ball against 10 men			0
staying in the @entity156 for @entity140 is worth millions of pounds and @entity157 knows when she does her spread sheets that , with @entity142 , top flight survival is nailed on year after year			1
do they want to change a style and risk that much money ? it reminds me of last year at @entity2 when some middle - aged gentleman at the end of a game leaned over , pointed his finger straight at me , and said : ' @entity170 you 're a f * * * * * * muppet and you do n't know what you 're doing			1
' at the time , we were four points clear at the top of the league			0
thankfully , i controlled myself , did n't turn back and just kept walking forward			1
of course , the temptation was to do a @entity178 on him , but that would 've been mad			0
enjoy the silence : @entity142 cups his ear to booing @entity140 fans during the win against @entity148 letting fly : @entity178 lunges at a @entity51 fan during a 1995 match at @entity186 time to @entity187 i still can not get my head around how more footballers have not opened up about being gay			1
nowadays in society i ca n't imagine anybody would care one little bit and i include team - mates , supporters , owners , and anyone else			2
i hope the law change over the weekend to allow same - sex marriages to take place will help the first @entity156 player to step up			2
let 's be honest , who 's bothered ? my week ... my saturday afternoons whilst i 've been between jobs have often been spent relaxing			2
i 'd usually take a stroll walking my dog @entity208 before going to a local hotel leisure club			0
there i 'd do a few lengths , enjoy a steam and a sauna , and then grab as many newspapers as i could and have a read			0
generally chillaxing , as i like to put it			0
open : @entity219 @entity218 is one of the few openly gay professional footballers back in the game : @entity170 is loving life as @entity224 manager after a roller coaster couple of weeks in charge there would be no anxiety about a refereeing decision , no anger about a defeat when we should 've won , it was all about calm and quiet			1
well , in the past two weeks since i 've returned to @entity224 as manager there could n't have been a greater contrast between the man going through 95 minutes in the technical area and the whale laid by the pool			1
our 2 - 0 win against @entity246 and a draw on saturday , away at second - placed @entity248 , has kept @entity224 in with an outside chance of sneaking into the play - offs			1
i 'd take this excited stress any day .			0

title - chasing sides prone to slip - ups late in season
@entity91 showed his @entity104 *doubters* who 's boss at @entity109
@entity140 boo boys are n't helping their club ... or @entity142
plus , why i *'m* delighted to be back in the game with @entity224
