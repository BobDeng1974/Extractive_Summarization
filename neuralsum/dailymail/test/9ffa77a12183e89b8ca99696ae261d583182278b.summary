@entity0 tells the kind of stories about management that might explain why retiring players are stampeding towards the pundits ’ couch			1
except that is not his intention			2
quite the opposite , in fact			2
the @entity12 manager loves a job that over the years has seen him break and rebuild a toilet , man a hose and pay salaries from his own pocket			1
‘ it ’s the life i want for myself , ’ he said			2
‘ it gets me out of bed			2
’ but there is no escaping the fact that @entity0 is in a shrinking minority , being one of only four managers in the country ’s top 92 clubs who has played for @entity29			1
the drain of leading @entity32 players to television rather than management was the key finding of a @entity37 study			1
it seems that talking about the game is more appealing to former players than a life orchestrating it — easier money , less time and pressure			1
many ex-players simply have no financial need to work but for @entity0 , money has only ever been just a part of it			1
@entity0 insists football management was always his priority after ending his playing career @entity0 has taken charge of @entity12 after learning his trade in the lower league backwaters ‘ @entity56 was all i had and all i wanted , ’ he said			1
‘ as for ex-internationals , i guess there will be fewer going to management now because of the money they earn			2
you ’d think they do n’t need a wage but some will have only a passion for football			2
‘ that might mean being in front of a camera			2
i have done a bit for @entity72 and i really enjoyed it but first and foremost i am a coach and manager			1
that ’s how it is for some managers – it ’s what you are			2
‘ but if you are like that you have to like a challenge			0
’ few are better placed to illustrate the challenge of management than @entity0			1
he won three @entity29 caps but has spent most of the past 13 years in places where tv rights do not sell for billions			1
he started at @entity85 and went on to @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 before joining @entity90 @entity89 last september after nearly five years coaching @entity91 and @entity92 under @entity93			1
@entity0 ( right ) is one of only four former @entity29 players to currently manage in the football league the well - travelled defender played for a total of 10 clubs during his career , including @entity100 @entity0 claims to have caught the management bug after playing for @entity102 under @entity103 and @entity104 the 51 - year - old ’s days are long and his experiences would not seem such fond memories to everyone			1
‘ at @entity86 , i drove around looking for places to train , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ elsewhere , i ’ve raised money to pay bills for training facilities that have n’t been paid for			0
you are also lending people money for wages that have not been paid			0
‘ at @entity85 , we had a toilet in the middle of the changing room so i helped knock it down and rehouse it			1
’ it was at @entity85 that @entity0 used a fireman ’s hose to water the training pitch			1
‘ you do everything you can , ’ he added			0
‘ you get your hands dirty			0
most days i ’ll be in my office at 8.15am and i ’ll usually leave at 5.15pm			0
then i ’m often in the car to go and watch a game			0
‘ sometimes you ’ll go to three in a week			0
being in @entity12 that ’s a lot of time in the car , getting home after midnight			1
’ it ’s all part of the puzzle of turning thoughts into performances and performances into results			0
that ’s what keeps managers like @entity0 hooked			1
@entity0 started his management career at @entity85 where he missed out on promotion to @entity147 @entity0 returned to former club @entity87 as manager but could not save them from relegation in 2007 @entity0 tooks @entity88 on a run of 22 consecutive away games without defeat before being sacked ‘ winning matches is what i love , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i got a bug for coaching when i was playing at @entity102 ( in the late 1990s ) under @entity103 and @entity104			0
‘ i wanted to understand why we were doing something			0
‘ @entity104 started showing me his coaching journals that he had kept for years , logging every session			0
all my coaching sessions now are logged			0
‘ the development plans i have for every player now are also logged			2
i am plotting their development on my own graphs , watching how they reach targets			0
‘ there is nothing better than improving a player and seeing it on the saturday			2
’ the 51 - year - old spent five years working as a coach under @entity93 at @entity91 and then @entity92 @entity0 believes there is no better feeling than developing a player to reach their targets and nothing worse than getting the sack			1
it has already happened to @entity0 and will probably happen again			1
‘ the overall challenge is to build a team but that takes 18 months , ’ he said			0
‘ how often do you get 18 months in a job ? @entity187 is best — you talk about philosophies and there is no pressure			0
then the season starts and you need results			0
it ’s a challenge , a good challenge			0
’ and obviously it ’s not for everyone			0
for others , it ’s a peculiar part of the charm .			0
