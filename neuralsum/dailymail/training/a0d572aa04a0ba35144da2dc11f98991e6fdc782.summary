by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:22 pm on 28th december 2011 the trial of @entity3 resumed today after a three month break with the ousted @entity6 leader returning to the metal defendants ' cage in a @entity10 courtroom			1
@entity6 state television showed the 83 - year - old covered by a green blanket and lying on a hospital gurney when he was brought from a helicopter and taken to an ambulance for the short ride to the courthouse			2
he remained on the gurney throughout the hearing and spoke only once to say ' present ' when judge @entity22 called out his name at the start of the session			0
appearance : ousted @entity6 president @entity3 was wheeled into court today , like he was in this picture in september , to continue with his trial which had been delayed for three months @entity3 is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising in january and february that forced him out of office			1
he could face the death penalty if convicted			1
he has been under arrest since april , but he has never gone to prison and instead has been confined to hospitals			0
his lawyers and doctors say he is suffering from heart problems			0
@entity3 and his two sons , who are in prison , also face corruption charges in the same case			1
today 's session lasted for only a few hours , and the next session is set for january 2			0
an 18 - day uprising forced @entity3 to step down on february 11 after 29 years in power			1
protests and unrest have continued throughout the year , with pro-democracy activists keeping up pressure for reforms from the military , which took over from @entity3			2
unrest : protests have continued since @entity3 was ousted from power in february , with pro-democracy activists keeping up pressure for reforms from the military which took over clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people since @entity3 's was ousted			1
judge @entity22 approved new requests from defence lawyers to expand the case to include other incidents of violence and deaths of protesters since @entity3 's ousting			2
@entity3 's lawyers argued the killing of protesters continued even after he stepped down and asked for this to be considered evidence that he was not responsible for the killings			1
the requests appeared to be part of a strategy to try to show that protesters were not killed by security forces , but by assailants working for a foreign nation or criminals impersonating police officers			0
one request the judge granted was for the @entity90 to provide the court with a list of firearm and ammunition stores looted during the early days of the @entity96 uprising , as well as the type of weapons taken			0
he said he would also demand a list of stores that sell military and police uniforms and were looted during the same period			0
riots : clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people since @entity3 was ousted @entity22 also agreed to ask authorities for the police reports on vehicles stolen from the force during the uprising and details about foreigners arrested in @entity6 during the same period for involvement in unlawful acts			1
relations between the mostly youthful activists and the nation 's military rulers have steadily worsened over the past few months , hitting a new low this month when soldiers brutally beat and stomped on protesters , including women , in clashes that left at least 18 people dead			0
@entity3 's trial began in august , and many in the country were riveted by the sight of the longtime authoritarian ruler lying on a hospital bed inside the defendant 's cage , flanked by his two sons , who formerly wielded tremendous power			2
during early sessions , the trial was bogged down by frequent commotion and arguments in the courtroom between lawyers representing both sides			0
eventually , the judge banned the media as he summoned high - ranking officials to testify			0
the prosecution 's case depends heavily on accounts of members of the former president 's inner circle including ex-spy chief @entity148 , who was appointed vice president by @entity3 during the uprising in september , field marshal @entity151 , the head of @entity6 's ruling military council and @entity3 's defence minister for some 20 years , testified under a total media blackout			1
journalists were barred from the court and forbidden to report any leaked details of his testimony			0
many believe @entity151 can address the key question of whether @entity3 ordered the use of lethal force against protesters , or at least knew about it and did nottry to stop it			2
reporters were allowed in the courtroom today , but live tv coverage was banned			0
also on trial with @entity3 and facing the same charges are his former interior minister , @entity172 , and six senior former security officials			2
@entity3 and his two sons , @entity175 and @entity176 , also face corruption charges			1
the prosecution 's case depends heavily on accounts of members of the former president 's inner circle including ex-spy chief @entity148 , who was appointed vice president by @entity3 during the uprising .			1
