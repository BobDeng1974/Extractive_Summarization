@entity1 chief sir @entity2 : two - fifths of teachers quit within five years because the job is too tough thousands of newly qualified teachers are being ‘ left to flounder ’ in schools each year because of their inadequate training , @entity7 ’s chief inspector warned yesterday			1
sir @entity2 said it was a ‘ national scandal ’ that teachers were arriving for work completely unprepared for the job			1
the @entity16 chief inspector said 40 per cent quit the profession within five years of qualifying because they found it ‘ too difficult ’ and were ill - equipped to deal with unruly pupils			1
sir @entity2 claimed teachers were being tutored by people with little ‘ up - to - date ’ experience and left to ‘ flounder ’ in schools with senior staff doing nothing to support them			1
in future , he added , @entity16 would be cracking down on course providers			0
he also took a swipe at unions for portraying the teachers they represent as ‘ perpetual victims ’			1
about 30,000 teachers are trained each year , suggesting that some 12,000 of those switch careers after a short period of time			0
the average cost of training is around £ 10,000 – meaning tens of millions of taxpayers ’ money is being squandered annually			0
sir @entity2 said : ‘ how many times have heads said to me their trainees had been tutored by people with little or no up - to - date school experience or a record of outstanding teaching ? ‘ trainees have been sent into schools inadequately prepared to deal with poor behaviour			1
even worse , how many times have i heard they were left to flounder because they received little or no support from senior and middle leaders ? ’ the amount of new teachers leaving the profession was a ‘ national scandal ’ given the money invested in their training , he said			2
sir @entity2 insisted there has ' never been a better time to be a teacher ' despite the two largest unions , the @entity69 and @entity70 , holding a series of strikes over pay and conditions ( pictured ) he added : ‘ i think most of them leave because of misbehaviour			2
they find it far too challenging , far too difficult			0
’ there are several routes into teaching , including postgraduate certificates and school - based training including bursaries			0
speaking at an education conference in @entity86 , sir @entity2 said from september inspectors will ask newly qualified teachers if they ‘ well supported , particularly in dealing with pupil behaviour ’			1
if they were struggling , @entity16 will check who trained them – with the threat this could affect the institution ’s inspection grade			0
he went on to insist there has ‘ never been a better time to be a teacher ’ – despite the two largest unions , the @entity69 and @entity70 , holding a series of strikes over pay and conditions			2
‘ i find it extremely frustrating when teachers are portrayed , sometimes by their own representatives , as victims who have little control or say over their own professional lives , ’ he said			0
‘ [ they ] risk infantilising the profession and depressing recruitment			0

sir @entity2 said 40 per cent quit the profession within five years
he said the agency will be cracking down on the quality of training
inspector also swiped at unions for making teachers ' perpetual victims '
discipline tsars would be introduced in every school under a @entity127 *government* to crack down on misbehaviour , education *spokesman* @entity123 said yesterday . the ‘ behaviour experts ’ – either new *members* of staff or specially trained teachers – would help claw back control of *classrooms* from unruly pupils and allow teachers to do their jobs , he said .
