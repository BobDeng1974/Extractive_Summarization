by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 motorsport boss @entity2 has implemented a new code of conduct with regard to team orders for drivers @entity8 and @entity10			1
@entity2 was forced to act following events that unfolded during the @entity13 @entity12 at the end of last month when @entity8 was surprisingly told to allow @entity10 by			1
running third and fourth at the time , and with 20 laps of the race remaining , the differing strategies of the duo forced the pit wall crew at @entity3 into what non-executive chairman @entity20 later described as ' a panic '			0
action : @entity2 has implemented a new code of conduct with regard to team orders for drivers starting from pole position , early crashes and safety car periods had resulted in @entity3 opting for an aggressive three - stop plan with @entity10 in a bid to ensure he took the chequered flag			1
starting from the pit lane and last on track at the end of lap one , those same crashes and safety cars played its part in propelling @entity8 into a fight for a podium , potentially even the win , and so two stops was preferred			0
@entity8 , however , declined to let @entity10 past when told to do so , citing the fact the @entity47 was never close enough to make an overtaking manoeuvre			2
the duo eventually finished third and fourth in the race , allowing @entity8 to close the gap on a disgruntled @entity10 in the drivers ' standings to 11 points			2
duel : @entity8 ( left ) declined to let team - mate @entity10 through during the @entity13 @entity12 in clearing the air with both men , @entity2 now maintains the drivers will continue to be free to race over the closing eight grands prix , but with a new directive should circumstances arise			1
speaking to @entity47 newspaper @entity63 , @entity2 said : ' we will augment our team agreement before the season that the driver behind must clearly show he is faster before a passing manoeuvre can be instructed			0
' @entity2 appreciates if @entity8 had lost momentum in pulling to one side for @entity10 it would have compromised his chances of a strong result			2
' no one should have to go off the gas , ' added @entity2			0
' our drivers are allowed to freely compete against each other for the rest of the season when it comes to the victory			0
