the first human trials of a new @entity2 vaccine are today underway , the latest step in attempts to halt the spread of the virus in @entity7			1
scientists at @entity9 have immunised the first healthy volunteers with a new drug , which they hope will protect people against the disease			1
the @entity14 said today more than 8,100 people have now lost their lives to the virus , the majority in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
in september a separate trial was launched at the university , to test the effects of another potential vaccine			2
the @entity26 , part of the @entity28 of @entity29 , aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adult volunteers by the end of this month			1
they hope to immunise 72 adults by the end of the month the study involves a ' prime - boost ' vaccine regime , meaning volunteers are given a first ' prime ' injection to stimulate an initial immune response			1
two months later they are given an additional booster injection , intended to enhance the body 's immune response			1
the trial organisers stressed the vaccine does not contain any replicating virus , so it can not cause anyone to be infected with @entity2			1
the immune responses that the vaccine generates – both antibodies and t cells – will also be measured over a period of one year			2
the new @entity2 vaccine is being trialled by the @entity26			1
they aim to have vaccinated 72 healthy adult volunteers , aged 18 - 50 , by the end of this month			1
the study involves a ' prime - boost ' vaccine regime in which volunteers are first given a ' prime ' injection to stimulate an initial immune response			1
two months later they are given an additional booster injection , intended to enhance the body 's immune response			1
the trial organisers stressed the vaccine does not contain any replicating virus , so it is can not cause anyone to be infected with @entity2			1
the immune responses that the vaccine generates – both antibodies and t cells – will also be measured over a period of one year			0
previous trials showed the vaccine was successful in protecting primates against the @entity79 strain of @entity2 – which is similar to the virus causing the current outbreak in @entity7			1
the strain has a mortality rate of up to 90 per cent , according to the @entity14			0
the trial 's main objective is to test the vaccine 's safety , and to test in which order the two vaccine components should be given in a prime - boost regime , and how far apart			1
developers of the drug , the @entity93 , have now accelerated the trial due to the continued spread of @entity2 in @entity7			2

since its outbreak the killer disease has claimed more than 8,000 lives across @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity19			0
further studies of this vaccine are being planned for the @entity114 and in @entity7 early next year			0
dr @entity115 , from the @entity26 , said : ' we aim to immunise all participants within a month ; the main aim is to understand the safety profile of the vaccines			2
' the devastating @entity2 epidemic in @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity20 continues to see hundreds of new cases each week and has placed a huge burden on these countries ' infrastructures			0
' while public health measures are currently still the best way to bring the outbreak under control , if we have a safe and effective vaccine it could begin to have an impact later this year			0
' that is the goal that is seeing manufacturers , public health bodies and research regulators come together to accelerate the first clinical trials of new @entity2 vaccines			1
' volunteers are given a ' prime ' injection to stimulate an initial immune response			1
two months later they are given an additional booster injection to enhance the immune response to the virus ( pictured ) the trial starting today follows another trial launched in september last year , also based in @entity9			1
@entity148 ( right ) , a 48 - year - old @entity149 communications manager from @entity150 , @entity151 , was the first healthy @entity152 to be injected with an experimental vaccine to fight the deadly ebola virus			0
the results are due this month the trial beginning today is part of a series of safety trials of potential @entity2 vaccines aimed at preventing the disease			1
in september , a trial of another @entity2 vaccine developed by @entity164 ( @entity165 ) began			2
this vaccine used a single ebola virus protein to generate an immune response , but similarly could not cause anyone to become infected with @entity2 as it did n't contain infectious virus material			1
the trial vaccinated 60 healthy volunteers and initial results are expected this month			2
a third @entity2 vaccine being developed by the biotech company @entity175 will also soon be trialled , as well as others in development in @entity178			2
dr @entity115 said the more vaccines being trialled , the better			0
he said : ' the fact that there are at least three @entity2 vaccines entering these early safety trials is good news			1
' we are not playing first past the post here			0
having multiple vaccines progressing through clinical trials increases the likelihood of vaccine manufacturers having the capacity to meet production demands should mass immunisation be required			0
' the more vaccines and more manufacturers there are working on this , the better			0
' the trial comes as the @entity2 screening system at @entity203 airports has been toughened up after a @entity203 nurse who later developed the virus was waived through			2
the trial begins after the @entity2 screening system at @entity203 airports has been toughened up after @entity203 nurse @entity207 , ( pictured left and right ) who later developed the virus , was waived through			2
ms @entity207 is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with @entity2 last monday , after five weeks in @entity20 nurse @entity207 , 39 , is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with @entity2 last monday having spent five weeks treating victims in @entity20			0
it later emerged that officials at @entity215 had allowed her to board a connecting flight to @entity217 even though she had complained of a fever			0
@entity203 health secretary @entity219 yesterday announced that officials had introduced more rigorous checks for doctors and nurses returning to the @entity203 following volunteer work			0
until recently , the screening only involved them having their temperature taken and filling - in a questionnaire about whether they have come into contact with patients			0
but from now on , anyone who thinks they are mildly unwell will be kept on and made to undergo further checks even if their temperature seems normal			0
officials will also seek advice from tropical disease experts and monitor the patient closely for a number of hours			0
ms @entity207 , from @entity217 , remains in a critical but stable state at a special isolation unit at the @entity242 in @entity243 .			0

@entity9 scientists begin to immunise volunteers
hope to immunise 72 adults by the end of the month to trial the new jab
a prime injection is followed by a booster to *strengthen* immune response
the vaccine was successful in protecting primates against @entity2
there are now at least three @entity2 vaccines being trialled for safety
