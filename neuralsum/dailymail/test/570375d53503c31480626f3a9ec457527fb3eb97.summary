there was no glorious @entity2 send - off for sir @entity3 despite a terrific effort from the @entity5 in the @entity6			1
the 2012 @entity8 winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad , ' @entity12 ' , before a return to the track ahead of the @entity15 , and wanted to sign off from what he called a ' golden era ' with a win in one of the sport 's most prestigious races			1
but it was not to be as @entity24 's @entity23 produced the perfect race to cross the line first at the end of a gruelling 151 - mile trek which took in 27 tortuous cobbled spells			2
@entity3 sits on the floor after failing to win his final race with @entity2 in the @entity32 - @entity6 @entity12 left everything on the road as he attempted to bow out in glorious fashion , but was unable to hold on @entity24 @entity23 celebrates as he crosses the line , winning the race ahead of @entity12 in 18th @entity12 did his best , breaking away with 32 kilometres left to shake things up at the head of the peloton , while he also made a late push , but in the end he had to settle for a place down the line in 18th as @entity45 took the glory			1
in the process he became the first rider to take first in the @entity49 and @entity6 in the same year since @entity50 back in 1986			2
one of the sport 's classic races , the one - day slog did not fail to disappoint , but the drama almost got out of hand at one stage as some of the riders had a lucky escape when a train sped through the tracks they were due to cross			1
some of the field slipped across despite the safety barriers being down , while others were held at the gate before being able to resume			0
@entity23 celebrates his win alongside @entity67 ( left ) and @entity68 ( right ) @entity12 led a breakaway with 32 kilometres remaining , but was unable to maintain his lead to win after that interlude the drama returned to the saddle , although @entity2 's in - form @entity74 was unable to play a part			1
amongst the early front - runners he was unseated when he ran into a curb , while he also suffered injuries on the way which eventually reduced him to a participant			0
for @entity12 it was always going to be a case of leaving nothing on the road ahead of his next phase , which is to include a ride at the @entity90			2
he first made himself known in the race when he moved to the head of the peloton with 45 kilometres to go and , with 32 remaining he ditched the pack in a bid to reel in the leaders			0
the peloton drew him back but his intent was clear and he held pace with them until @entity68 and @entity102 went for it on their own			0
@entity104 ( right ) finished ahead of @entity12 in the end , coming in eighth , @entity2 's best performance the pair were joined by @entity23 and then @entity67 and at this point it was clear @entity111 ' race was run			1
he found some extra power to go it alone again but the top prize was no longer on the table for him and he was amongst the rest as @entity23 won the race in two laps of the @entity118			0
in the end @entity104 was @entity2 's first man home in eighth , while @entity67 and @entity123 took second and third respectively .			0

@entity3 finished 18th in the @entity126 - @entity6
@entity12 is set to leave @entity2 to ride in his own squad called ' @entity12 '
race almost had dramatic *incident* when riders *narrowly* missed a train
