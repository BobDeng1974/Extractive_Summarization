there were famous faces in the best seats in the house as optimism over a new era abounded			1
@entity6 , officially the @entity7 , was by @entity9 ’s side in the director ’s box in a highly symbolic return to @entity13			1
he was joined by one of the club ’s greatest ever managers , @entity14 , and @entity17 , who can lay claim to some of the greatest ever declamations against the ousted boardroom regime			1
@entity23 midfielder @entity22 , on loan from @entity25 , celebrates putting the home side ahead at @entity13 @entity28 striker @entity27 ( centre ) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller the greatness , somewhat predictably , stopped at the white lines of the pitch			1
this ramshackle group of players looked like they might just let the feelgood factor flourish when @entity25 loanee @entity22 put them ahead with 12 minutes remaining			1
there would not , however , be the delicious irony of one of @entity43 ’s men allowing @entity45 a victory to savour in their first home match since seizing control			2
all the failings that have left the @entity13 side in the midst of a @entity52 play - off scrap they may well not win came to the fore as 17 - year - old @entity27 – making just his second senior appearance - equalised for @entity55 eight minutes later			1
in truth , it was a point they more than merited			2
jeers rang out at the final whistle as supporters who flocked back to @entity13 to financially support the new board digested yet another on - field setback			1
the grim sequence of results now reads as just one win in their last seven outings			2
for @entity9 and his associates , the question of what can be done to lift a desperately flagging season remains highly pertinent			2
discussions with caretaker manager @entity74 will have to determine whether he continues or whether an alternative interim appointment is made for the remainder of the campaign			2
this was not the first time this season that @entity55 had found themselves featuring in a significant day in the @entity23 saga			1
back on december 12 , their comprehensive 2 - 0 victory at @entity84 became almost an addendum to news that @entity87 had handed in his notice			2
for the visiting support inside the @entity92 ground , it was yet another bewildering development to try and digest			2
@entity23 legend @entity6 was in the stands at @entity13 for tuesday night 's @entity52 clash events tumbled even quicker from then , through @entity87 ’s gardening leave , an @entity101 , crisis loan offers and boardroom resignations , finally reaching the regime change arrived at with last friday ’s @entity102			1
somewhere in the middle of the jumble was the @entity107 ’s refusal , on christmas eve of all days , to allow @entity43 to increase his shareholding			2
it was one of several , crucial turning points on the exceptionally winding road towards a fresh start for a club bruised and battered over the previous four years			2
the desperation of supporters to grasp this moment , for those who stayed away to return to supporting their team , was palpable			2
some had purchased half - season tickets in the wake of the @entity102 , despite some of the included matches having already passed			0
last night , routes around @entity13 were congested in fashion often unfamiliar this season			1
the stadium was n’t full , but the 35,018 here was still the highest crowd recorded since the opening day of the season			0
anyone purchasing a programme on their way in was greeted by a cover showing @entity9 with his arms around @entity134 and @entity135 , happily posing within the trophy room			0
the question , of course , was how long it would last when confronted by the paucity of the @entity23 team			1
given the boos that rang out at half - time , the answer could be given as approximately 45 minutes			0
fresh from a dispiriting 0 - 0 draw with @entity148 at the weekend , @entity74 ’s side had actually made a pretty positive start – as if feeding off the renewed energy			0
@entity151 picked out @entity152 with a nice cutback and the striker drilled narrowly wide from the edge of the area			1
not long after , @entity152 was unable to generate sufficient power or direction in a header			0
yet their best chance of the opening period fell to the other front man in @entity74 ’s 4 - 4 - 2			0
@entity22 fashioned the opportunity by cutting in field to hit a deflected drive that was pushed out by @entity168 in the @entity55 goal			1
@entity170 looked odds - on to polish things off but spooned the rebound over the bar on the slide			0
@entity22 celebrates hos goal with substitute @entity177 ( left ) , @entity152 and @entity178 queens had shown a nice degree of composure in midfield and steadily began to assert themselves			1
slowly but surely , the atmosphere changed			0
when @entity151 was robbed on the fringe of the area by @entity189 after 34 minutes , the first real roar of frustration arrived			0
by that point , the visitors could already have been ahead			1
@entity192 missed a defensive header to allow @entity194 in behind him			0
he picked out @entity195 , whose neatly - struck effort beat @entity197 but rebounded off the goalkeeper ’s right - hand post			0
@entity13 heaved a sigh of relief			1
but it was not the last first - half scare			0
when @entity197 was forced into evasive action to deny a fine @entity207 strike , the loose ball spun towards @entity194			0
he could n’t adjust his body quickly enough to head below the bar from around six yards out			0
@entity170 looped one wide from a @entity211 cross after the restart but that was n’t the signal for a @entity23 bombardment			1
a change was needed if a resolute and sparky @entity55 side were n’t going to spoil the party			1
one finally arrived from @entity74 in the 65th minute when young @entity220 was replaced by the even younger @entity221			0
the 18 - year - old at least injected a little more pace and energy to proceedings			0
it seemed as though @entity23 had finally sneaked a winner after 78 minutes			1
@entity22 got a touch to a ball delivered from the left before @entity152 practically stumbled into it			1
it broke back to the @entity25 loanee who calmly angled a shot into the far corner of the net			0
this is , however , a team riven with weaknesses			0
and they were exposed yet again when @entity55 claimed a leveller they deserved with just four minutes to play			1
@entity177 – just on four minutes earlier after @entity211 was hurt – was typically wayward with a bungled attempt at a clearance that looped to @entity244			0
he delivered into the middle , where @entity197 expertly saved from @entity195			0
there was , though , to be no denying teenager @entity14 , who was left with a simple finish into an exposed net .			0

@entity22 put @entity23 ahead against @entity55 on tuesday
@entity28 striker @entity27 scored late equaliser
@entity23 legend @entity6 was at @entity13 for the @entity52 *fixture*
