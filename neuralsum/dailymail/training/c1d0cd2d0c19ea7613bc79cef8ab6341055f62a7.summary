by @entity0 the male giant panda at @entity3 zoo poses seductively today as he gets ready to mate			0
@entity4 reclines in the sunshine and gets ready to mate with his female partner @entity6			1
she has only a 36 - hour annual fertility window when she can mate			0
she was also photographed today as she relaxed by her pool while anxious staff wait for her hormone levels to peak			0
when scientists believe the time is right , the pair will meet up to three times a day for 15 to 30 - minute intervals			1
the pair were introduced to each other during breeding season last year but they failed to mate			1
throughout the rest of the year the two giant pandas are kept apart because they are naturally territorial and could attack one another			2
@entity6 and @entity4 are the first giant pandas to live in the @entity40 for 17 years			1
laid back : the two pandas failed to mate when encouraged to do so by staff at the zoo a year ago get me ! @entity6 enjoys the pool in her enclosure at @entity47 as she approaches her annual window of opportunity when her hormones are high @entity47 , where the pair have lived since their arrival from @entity54 in december 2011 , has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas , including controlled lighting , urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping			1
if @entity6 does fall pregnant , it will be july or the first half of august when @entity47 experts will be able to confirm it by using ultrasound scans			2
the majority of giant panda cubs are born at the very end of august or beginning of september			0
although females may give birth to two young , usually only one survives			0
prepared : male @entity4 , pictured , will be put together three times a day for 15 - 30 minutes with his female mate when zoo staff try and get them to mate the giant pandas â€™ naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population in the wild from recovering quickly from illegal hunting , habitat loss , and other human - related causes of mortality			1
a spokeswoman for the zoo said : ' things are looking very positive			0
@entity6 's hormones are continuing to rise and we are waiting for her to hit her peak			2
' @entity4 is ready to go			2
he has been doing lots of scent - marking			0
it 's just a question of waiting now			0
' exploring : @entity4 has a look round his enclosure just hours before he is encouraged to mate mating season : @entity6 can only mate successfully when her hormones are at their peak			1

female @entity6 and @entity4 will meet up three times a day for 15 to 30 minutes when scientists believe the time is right
