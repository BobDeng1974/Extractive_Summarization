by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 10 may 2013 care minister @entity1 wants to end a ' cover - up culture ' in the @entity3 hospitals that give false information about death rates will face unlimited fines under a package of new powers aimed at preventing another @entity11 - style health scandal			1
ministers hope the new criminal offence will deter health chiefs from giving false or misleading mortality statistics as part of efforts to bring an end to a ‘ cover - up culture ’ in the @entity3			1
care minister @entity1 said the laws would be a legacy of the campaign fought by those who suffered the ‘ horrors ’ of failings at @entity24			1
legislation published yesterday will also make it easier to sack managers or even shut down hospital services guilty of providing poor care			2
until now , hospitals have only been able to be put into administration if they get into financial problems			0
the @entity35 also sets out plans for a cap on the amount people will have to pay for social care			2
a £ 72,000 limit on costs will be introduced in 2016 and the threshold for financial assistance will be extended from £ 23,250 to £ 118,000 at the same time			1
the legislation responds in part to @entity48 's report on the failings at @entity50 which found that as many as 1,200 patients might have died needlessly after they were ‘ routinely neglected ’			0
new powers will give the regulator monitor the ability to intervene if the chief inspector of hospitals identifies problems with the quality of care			0
monitor will also be able , for the first time , to put a foundation trust into administration on clinical grounds if the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) requires it			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the chief inspector of hospitals if he spots poor care will be able to serve a notice which will ultimately end up , if nothing is done to address it , with the potential for the board or individual members to be removed and ultimately for the hospital trust to be put into administration			2
’ the minister said those affected by the @entity50 scandal ‘ suffered wholly unacceptably ’			0
‘ in a way a legacy of their campaign is that we are introducing new rules that will be much more effective for the future , ’ he said			0
ministers hope the reforms will prevent a repeat of the care failings at @entity90 where up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died the @entity92 will give the @entity65 legal powers to design a new rating system for hospitals and care homes , similar to the way @entity100 measures the performance of schools			0
the new criminal offence will apply to all providers of @entity3 secondary care , including private firms , and will initially be restricted to the treatment of mortality data			1
one of the criticisms of the response to the @entity50 situation has been the lack of individual accountability , but the new criminal offence will only apply to organisations rather than the people responsible			2
however mr @entity1 said under employment law a prosecution would give ‘ pretty powerful justification for dismissal ’ of any individual identified as responsible for giving false or misleading data			1
he said the actions taken by the government , including steps already announced such as a duty of candour and a ban on gagging clauses , were ‘ bringing an end to the cover - up culture that has existed in some places in the past ’			1
asked whether the government 's measures would prevent another @entity50 , he said the package ‘ achieves an awful lot in protecting us from anything like that happening again ’ .			0

care minister @entity1 promises an end to @entity3 's ' cover - up culture '
new criminal offence of giving false or misleading mortality statistics
new laws will also put £ 72,000 cap on *elderly* care costs
