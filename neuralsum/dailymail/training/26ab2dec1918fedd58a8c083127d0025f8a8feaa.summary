by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 1 june 2012 anger : live on air mr @entity2 said @entity3 could be vomited out of the @entity4 like a bad kebab , to the anger of a guest @entity2 has compared @entity3 's potential exit from the @entity4 to that of ' a bad kebab ' being ' vomited out			1
' the @entity12 presenter was given a tongue - lashing by a @entity3 guest and criticised on @entity15 after his comments , made on the show last night , were branded ' offensive ' and ' disrespectful ' to the country and its people			1
the abrasive @entity21 journalist was describing @entity3 's political and financial problems when he used the ' bad kebab ' analogy to explain what the rest of the @entity25 may want to do with them			2
but after he was criticised mr @entity2 backed down , not defending his analogy			0
@entity3 has another election in mid-june , which could decide whether or not they stay in the @entity4			2
but as pro and anti-bailout parties are neck and neck in the polls another stalemate is possible , which could force @entity4 countries like @entity38 and @entity39 to throw them out themselves			0
' so the rest of the @entity25 now contemplates something we were being told was n't conceivable recently , that , like a bad kebab , @entity3 is vomited out of the single @entity44 currency , ' mr @entity2 said			2
but former @entity3 finance minister @entity45 then turned on him and told him off live on air last night			1
@entity47 : former @entity3 finance minister @entity45 told mr @entity2 off live on air uncertainty : @entity3 is in a state of political and social turmoil , that could hasten its exit from the single @entity44 currency ' i take issue with your bad kebab analogy , which i find offensive , ' he said			1
' the @entity3 economy is in a crisis and the @entity3 people are going through a lot and they deserve some respect			1
i really did not find that very appropriate			0
' backed : mr @entity45 won the support of @entity15 users , one of whom praised him for making mr @entity2 ' look a total idiot ' one tweeter backed mr @entity45 , writing : ' @entity2 was made to look a total idiot by comparing the @entity3 economy to a bad kebab			1
' another added : ' that former @entity3 finance minister really slapped him down			1
' @entity3 was forced to call a june 17 vote after a parliamentary election on may 6 left parliament divided evenly between groups of parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a 130 billion - euro rescue package agreed with lenders in march			0
@entity3 's pro-bailout @entity82 ( @entity82 ) party is only just ahead of the anti-bailout @entity85 party meanwhile @entity87 voters are deciding whether their government can ratify the @entity90 's fiscal treaty , a deficit - fighting pact designed to bind @entity92 and other debt - crippled eurozone members to tighter spending limits			0
both sides forecast victory ahead of thursday 's start of voting			0
rejection could block @entity92 from tapping loans from the @entity90 's rescue fund in 2013 when @entity92 's current supply of bailout cash runs out			0
all polls during the campaign pointed to the treaty 's approval , but similar polls were proved wrong when @entity92 voted to reject @entity90 treaties in 2001 and 2008 comparison : but comparing the @entity4 decision to food poisoning from a kebab has upset some			0

@entity12 presenter was *swiftly* slapped down by former finance minister of @entity3 , a guest on the show
' the @entity3 economy is in a crisis and the @entity3 people deserve some respect , ' he said
