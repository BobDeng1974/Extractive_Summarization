controversial : @entity0 with @entity1 as the @entity2 in their heyday the son of porn baron and property magnate @entity7 has attacked a new film about his father as a ‘ tawdry farce ’ – dismissing @entity0 ’s portrayal as an ‘ insulting caricature ’			1
@entity13 , 53 , who inherited 20 per cent of the family property empire , has refused to co-operate with director @entity15 on his movie , @entity17			1
he also took legal action to prevent it using the title @entity17 , a name associated with his father			1
he has , instead , agreed to back a rival warts - and - all film which will have that title and will be based on the diaries of his mother @entity25 which will , he claims , tell the true story of his parents ’ rags - to - riches rise			1
@entity17 , which opens this week , boasts a star cast including @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
but it is @entity0 ’s role as his father that has attracted particular anger from @entity13 , who claims the comedian has turned his family story into a ‘ @entity40 ’			1
‘ my father was nothing like @entity43 , the @entity0 alter ego , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s a caricature of a man who was so much more complex and who did a lot to make @entity50 the vibrant entertainment hub that it is today			1
’ @entity7 was a controversial figure who dominated @entity50 and the pornography industry throughout the @entity54 and eventually built up a £ 650 million property empire in @entity57 ’s @entity56			1
his interests included theatres , bars , magazines and strip clubs , frequented by everyone from @entity64 to @entity65			2
the most famous was @entity7 ’s @entity66 , which he turned into a private members ’ club to evade the censorious attention of the @entity71 , which in the early @entity72 barred models from moving			2
by 1967 , the venue was purely hosting striptease			2
this would , in turn , make way for glitzy , big - budget erotic shows			0
but @entity13 claims that his father helped change @entity81 , by lifting the sex industry from an illicit and seedy enterprise into a mainstream business			1
this week , he will launch a new gin , bearing the @entity88 name in tribute to his father			2
that was the name that was attached to him and the one that stuck , but really it was titillating seaside - postcard stuff			0
’ the public image of @entity7 in his heyday was of an absurdly flamboyant character who sported an elaborate comb - over hairstyle , comical specs and a perma - tan , and had on each arm a busty blonde , bursting out of an ill - fitting garment			0
but @entity13 recalls a father who played football with him in the garden and who always kept saturdays for his family			1
nightspot : @entity7 's @entity119 in @entity50 is pictured in 2003 ‘ he would sit and watch the wrestling on television during the afternoon , then have a snooze on the sofa			1
‘ both my book and film based on it will be a far more personal account than anything already out there in the public arena , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s about my family life rather than his public persona			0
i wanted to do it because i was fed up with reading things that were n’t true			0
‘ a lot of people wanted to tell a ‘ ‘ t * * * and bums ’ ’ story , but i did n’t think that was a fitting tribute for my dad			0
' one major @entity146 production company said they wanted @entity147 to do it or something , but i do n’t think he was right , so i said no. ‘ there were things in my mother ’s diary that happened before i was born			2
she gave it to me before she died in 2002			0
‘ she was going to write a book and there are pieces in the script critical to the early days from her notes			0
i suppose it ’s difficult to imagine how poor they were – they just did n’t have any money sometimes			0
’ @entity13 adds : ‘ i found out she had an illegal abortion in 1953 , before i was born , because they could not afford to have a child			1
she talks about how devastated she was			0
' they were in a situation where they could n’t afford to have children			0
‘ in the diary , she wrote that my father made her do it and she did n’t know if she would ever be able to forgive him			2
‘ she was devastated , which comes across in her diaries			2
’ when @entity7 died aged 82 in 2008 , there was speculation of a rift between him and his son , who now controls a large part of the estate			0
but @entity13 insists this is untrue			1
‘ i ’ve never read so much rubbish in my life , ’ he said			0
portrayal : actress @entity1 , left , plays @entity7 's wife @entity25 , right , in the film devoted : @entity7 pictured with his daughter @entity189 in 1989 ‘ there ’s this perception that he and i never spoke to each other , but that ’s totally false			1
i saw him once a week , which is a lot more than many people see their parents			0
’ equally false , he says , was speculation that his father had planned to turn the entire empire over to his sister @entity189 , before she died of a drugs overdose in 1992			2
‘ @entity203 tosh ! ’ @entity13 exclaimed			1
‘ my father loved her very much , but he once told me , “ she could n’t run a chip shop			2
” so , he would never have left her in charge			0
’ @entity7 did , however , leave the biggest slice of his wealth to @entity189 ’s daughters – @entity214 , 22 , and @entity215 , 27 – who were the other main beneficiaries in his will			0
@entity13 , who runs @entity218 , the property company left by his father , says he is satisfied with his lot			1
‘ my job is to pass on the estate as intact as possible			0
he left me at least 20 per cent , at least that ’s what i ’d admit to			0
i do n’t really think it ’s anyone else ’s business what the situation is			0
‘ my father ’s legacy is @entity50			1
thirty years ago i never imagined anyone attaching themselves to the area but , thanks to him , people now want to be attached to @entity50			1
