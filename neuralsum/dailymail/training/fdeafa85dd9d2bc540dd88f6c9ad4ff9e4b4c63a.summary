@entity1 's super-strike has been hailed for its brilliant technique that left fans around the world purring and showed that there is nothing better than a sweetly struck volley			1
but did it rank among the best volleyed efforts of all - time ? @entity10 looks back on the best volleyed goals that rival @entity1 's in a list of football 's greatest volleys			1
crash , bang , wallop : @entity1 showed there 's nothing better than a sweetly struck volleyed goal @entity20 - liant : but where does @entity1 's goal rank among the all - time greatest volleyed strikes ? 1 @entity24 : @entity26 v @entity25 , june 1988 ( @entity28 final ) the enormity of the occasion and the tightness of the angle mean @entity24 's iconic effort might never be beaten			1
waiting for the ball to drop over his shoulder , where most would have panicked the @entity37 produced a moment of magic , hooking the ball back across the ' keeper and into the net			0
simply the best : @entity24 's goal had everything - an outrageous piece of skill on a huge occasion 2 @entity48 : @entity50 v @entity49 , may 2002 ( @entity52 final ) again , the sense of occasion helps , and in club football they do n't come any bigger than the @entity52 final - but this was genius from @entity48			2
with a pretty average high ball dropping in the penalty area the @entity59 's thinking was - as usual - one step ahead of the rest			0
swinging his left boot at a right - angle he made an almost impossible shot look easy			0
classic : @entity48 's goal decided the @entity52 final at @entity70 in @entity71 , 2002 3 @entity72 : @entity73 v @entity74 , august 1995 ( @entity75 ) everyone knows that any goal that goes in off the crossbar looks twice as good as one that does n't - and @entity72 's stunning shot was already looking good before it hit the woodwork			2
despite leaning back just to control the strike the @entity83 controlled his effort to send it flying past a despairing @entity86			0
hero : @entity72 was a @entity73 icon - not least for his brilliant goal against @entity74 at @entity89 4 @entity90 : @entity92 v @entity91 , march 2000 ( @entity75 ) a brilliant and memorable effort from the mad @entity94 's playing days as he pulled off the perfect scissor - kick to score for @entity92			2
made even better by @entity90 's fairly casual celebration despite the ludicrous goal he has just scored - maybe he wanted to see a replay ? brilliant : @entity90 's stunning scissor kick set up @entity92 for a 2 - 1 win over @entity91 at @entity102 5 @entity103 : @entity104 v @entity25 , june 1988 ( @entity28 group stage ) @entity103 's goal is almost forgotten about at times , coming in the same tournament as @entity24 's best efforts , but it should n't be			1
the former @entity74 captain 's left - footed volley flew into the top corner from a long throw - in in a move that most would n't have even bothered attempting from the edge of the area			0
delight : @entity103 celebrates his wondergoal that left his @entity121 team - mates ecstatic 6 @entity122 : @entity124 v @entity123 , 2006 ( @entity75 ) @entity125 loves a spectacular goal and this was no different - running onto the ball on the edge of the penalty area he somehow maneuvered his body to slam home this volley			2
never forgotten : @entity125 celebrates his volleyed effort for former club @entity123 against @entity124 7 @entity136 : @entity139 v @entity137 , october 1993 ( @entity140 ) one of the biggest nights in @entity139 's history and they came to call on a man who had a habit of scoring big goals - @entity136 reacted fastest to a loose ball on the edge of the area and cannoned his shot past the ' keeper			1
local hero : @entity136 scored for @entity139 in @entity137 's first home loss to an @entity155 club 8 @entity156 : @entity157 v @entity123 , may 1995 ( @entity159 final ) ' @entity156 - from the half - way line ' was a taunt that followed @entity123 for years after this dramatic effort			1
a bit of a ' hit and hope ' effort but the dramatic nature of the goal - coming in the closing minutes of extra-time to win a @entity170 final - and the fact that it came from a full 45 yards out , has to rank it among the best			0
helpless : @entity156 's brilliant last - minute effort gave @entity173 no chance in the @entity123 goal 9 @entity1 : @entity176 v @entity26 , 2014 ( @entity178 group stage ) it takes something special to pull out a move like this on the biggest stage of them all - particularly for the lowest ranked team in the tournament			1
cahill brilliantly controlled and finished a routine ball across the penalty area all in one vicious swipe of his left boot			0
pick that one out : @entity1 recorded probably the best goal of the tournament so far in @entity194 10 @entity195 : @entity197 v @entity196 , june 1990 ( @entity178 round of 16 ) @entity195 's swivel to strike home a brilliant moment was one of @entity197 's most important goals - saving a nation from more dreaded penalties			1
the midfielder showed brilliant technique to secure @entity197 a place in the last eight - what would the @entity197 give for a moment like this in @entity20 ? flying high : @entity195 celebrates his brilliant goal to guide @entity197 past @entity196 after extra time			0

@entity1 scored a wondergoal as @entity176 went down 3 - 2 to @entity26
his @entity217 volleyed effort ranks among the best of all time
