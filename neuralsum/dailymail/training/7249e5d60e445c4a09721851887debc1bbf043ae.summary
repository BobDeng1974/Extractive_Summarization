@entity1 's famous @entity0 , home to the original star - spangled banner and @entity5 's spacesuit , hopes to set up a @entity7 outpost - but it will not share many of its most famous artefacts			1
it will be the world 's biggest museum 's first foreign branch and is proposed for the @entity12 in east @entity13			1
entry to the new £ 33million gallery , proposed on the site of the @entity18 water polo arena and due to open in 2021 , would be free like the majority of the capital 's museums			1
but it appears many of the @entity24 's most celebrated exhibits in @entity25 , which also includes the @entity26 and @entity28 's first light bulb , would not come to the @entity7			0
@entity13 outpost : @entity1 's @entity0 , the world 's biggest museum , is to open a new home abroad in the @entity12 , which will also bring in a host of other new projects @entity35 attraction : this flag raised when @entity1 defeated @entity7 in 1812 is one of the @entity24 's most famous artefacts - but it is too fragile to travel to @entity7 the ' iconic ' flag raise to celebrate @entity7 's defeat in @entity1 in 1812 , which inspired the @entity1 national anthem , is considered ' too fragile '			1
a decision has not been made on @entity45 's ruby slippers from ' @entity46 , ' the @entity48 space capsule that carried the first moon landers or art recovered when the @entity7 set fire to the @entity52			2
but the proposed 40,000 - square - foot @entity24 gallery would feature permanent and rotating exhibits from @entity24 sites including the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 and various art galleries			2
the @entity60 , @entity61 , the @entity62 , the @entity63 and @entity64 are other major museums also to have expanded globally			0
@entity24 acting secretary @entity65 said : ' we envision this as being a @entity24 facility that really allows us to show the breadth and depth of everything that we do			0
' so it wo n't be specifically focused on one topic but will allow us to run the gamut of things that we do - history , science , art , culture and the like '			0
history : @entity5 's spacesuit worn on the moon and @entity83 's first cornet is among 137million items held by the museum first flight : the @entity26 ' flyer is also held			1
@entity88 is shown here at the controls watched by his brother @entity90 at @entity92 in 1903 @entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 , added : ' it 's a great opportunity for us to get started and really to tell @entity1 's story			0
' it will be funded by donations raised by mayor of london @entity100 and entrance fees for special exhibitions			0
the @entity24 , which is the world 's largest museum , was set up in 1846 using money from @entity106 , a @entity7 scientist who never went to the @entity1			2
from geologic features such as @entity108 to undeniable antique treasures including @entity111 's stovepipe hat , the @entity24 has 137million artefacts across 19 museums			1
the @entity13 branch would be at the heart of the ' @entity117 ' cultural centre that would open in 2021			1
new location : the @entity24 , pictured in @entity25 , will share its site with the @entity120 , and will be free like most of @entity13 's museums the @entity120 , @entity122 and @entity123 would share the site with the new @entity24			1
around it will be @entity127 's new home in the @entity128 , an international broadcast centre taken over by @entity130 and a new @entity131			0
@entity100 said : ' it would be a massive coup to attract the @entity0 to east @entity13			2
' it will be a bright shining star in a constellation of heavenly bodies ' .			0
