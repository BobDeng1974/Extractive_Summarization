it 's been some battle - with some glorious moments along the way - but the ultimate race between @entity5 and @entity6 may soon be coming to an end			0
the world 's best two players have been going head - to - head to break @entity14 's all - time @entity13 goal record - which stands at a whopping 71			1
@entity5 has to be the firm favourite to overtake @entity14 first by sheer virtue of the fact that his @entity19 side take on @entity20 the night before @entity21 play @entity22 later this month , and he is also one goal ahead of his rival			2
@entity5 and @entity6 are battling it out to reach the top of the @entity13 scoring charts on their own @entity5 lining up a strike on goal against @entity30 in the @entity13 on wednesday night - he scored twice in a 2 - 0 victory @entity5 celebrates with @entity19 team - mate @entity32 after scoring against @entity30 in the @entity13 the @entity34 international celebrates scoring four goals against @entity36 in april 2010 at the @entity37 joint 1st : @entity5 ( @entity19 ) - 71 goals ; @entity14 ( @entity21 , @entity40 ) - 71 3rd : @entity6 ( @entity41 , @entity21 ) - 70 4th : @entity42 ( @entity43 , @entity41 , @entity21 ) - 56 5th : @entity44 ( @entity45 , @entity36 , @entity19 ) - 50 @entity5 drew level with the @entity21 legend @entity14 having scored a double in @entity19 's 2 - 0 win against @entity30 on wednesday night			1
the @entity19 star reached the total - despite playing 52 fewer games			0
@entity6 had a chance to to equal @entity14 's record before @entity5 as he was named in the @entity21 side who faced a makeshift @entity58 side a day earlier			2
but @entity59 scored the only goal of the game as 29 - year - old @entity6 drew a blank			0
real and @entity19 have already safely booked their passage through to the last 16 of the @entity13 so the attention turns to @entity14 's record in the next round of fixtures for the @entity68 giants			2
@entity6 , who recently won the @entity69 , has also taken 147 games more to score 400 career goals , with @entity5 reaching the same total in just 506 games			0
however , the former @entity41 forward only took 140 games to score 150 @entity76 goals , whereas it took @entity5 203 games to reach that tally			0
whatever happens it is set to be a truly remarkable climax to this latest duel between the two , but if @entity5 does set a new all - time @entity13 scoring record before @entity6 , the debate will still rage on as to who is the greatest of the two			1
@entity6 was unable to equal @entity14 's @entity13 goals record as he failed to score against @entity58 at the @entity89 @entity6 failed to score for just the third time this season during tuesday night 's @entity13 clash @entity21 legend @entity14 celebrates after scoring in the @entity13 final at @entity94 in 2002 @entity95 : @entity5 highlights			1

@entity5 equalled @entity14 's all - time @entity13 scoring record with a double against @entity30 on wednesday
the @entity19 forward has now scored 71 goals in the competition
@entity21 star @entity6 failed to find the net against @entity58 on tuesday night and remains on 70
@entity19 face @entity20 a day before @entity21 take on @entity22 in the next round of matches
