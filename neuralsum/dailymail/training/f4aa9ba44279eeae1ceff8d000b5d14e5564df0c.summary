ruling : @entity2 soldiers may not hold their enemies in @entity4 as prisoners for longer than 96 hours , mr @entity0 ruled yesterday @entity2 soldiers may not hold their enemies in @entity4 as prisoners for longer than 96 hours because to do so would breach their human rights , a judge ruled yesterday			1
it means that @entity10 chieftains captured by @entity2 troops must be freed to fight again within four days			1
the judgment – which followed claims brought by four @entity10 commanders now held in @entity4 jails – alarmed military chiefs and politicians			1
they believe soldiers should not be asked to fight and die on the battlefield according to the letter of human rights law			1
the 117 - page @entity23 ruling by mr @entity0 means that the @entity25 , and the @entity2 ’s @entity26 , which made the convention part of @entity2 law , apply wherever @entity2 troops are fighting			1
the judge said that by detaining @entity10 leader @entity30 for 106 days beyond the legal 96 - hour limit , @entity2 had breached his right to liberty			1
taxpayers will now have to pay compensation running into tens of thousands to @entity30 and three other captives involved in the case			0
the ruling also opens the way for many other @entity4 detainees to sue for compensation , with @entity2 law firms likely to be queuing up to help them			2
there will also be high legal costs for the taxpayer			0
two legal firms represented the @entity10 prisoners on no - win no - fee deals , and the case involved 11 barristers			2
the @entity52 is likely to face a six - figure @entity54 case revolved around the arrest and detention of @entity30 in april 2010			0
he said he was irrigating his family ’s fields in @entity61 province when @entity2 soldiers from a helicopter arrested him			1
@entity30 said he was then blindfolded , assaulted and bitten by a military dog			0
jail : it means that @entity10 chieftains captured by @entity2 troops must be freed to fight again within four days but @entity52 lawyers said that @entity2 soldiers trying to capture a @entity10 commander landed under heavy fire , and then gave chase to @entity30 and a second insurgent , whom they killed			1
@entity30 was bitten by a dog sent in to dig him out of a field after he refused to surrender			0
soldiers found a rocket propelled grenade launcher and two rounds of ammunition for it abandoned along the trail down which he had fled			0
the prisoner was held by the @entity2 and questioned for nearly a month			2
because @entity4 authorities had no room in their prisons for him , he was held by the @entity2 until finally handed over to @entity4 authorities on july 25 , 2010			1
lawyer : the judgment - which followed claims brought by four @entity10 commanders now held in @entity4 jails - alarmed military chiefs and politicians			1
above , lawyer @entity96 represented three of the @entity4 the judge said it was ‘ clear law ’ that the @entity26 binds the armed forces in @entity4			0
he said : ‘ the @entity2 @entity100 had no legal basis either under @entity4 law or in international law for detaining [ @entity30 ] after 96 hours			1
’ after the case , defence secretary @entity104 said the @entity52 would appeal against the ruling			0
‘ we can not send our armed forces into battle with both hands tied behind their backs , ’ he warned			0
‘ our troops must be able to detain our enemies who aim to maim and kill @entity2 service personnel and innocent civilians			2
it can not be right for the @entity25 to apply on the battlefield , restricting the ability of our troops to operate in combat			0
’ warning : chief of the general staff general sir @entity121 said : ' our freedom to conduct detention operations ' is ' vital to our ability to protect the lives of innocent civilians and our forces ' chief of the general staff general sir @entity121 said : ‘ our freedom to conduct detention operations and to exploit detainees for intelligence is vital to our ability to protect the lives of innocent civilians and our own forces			0
’ a spokesman for @entity135 , which represented @entity30 , said @entity2 troops will have to be instructed in human rights law			1
he three other @entity4 were represented by @entity139 , run by left - wing solicitor @entity96			2
in another case last month , the @entity52 said that @entity142 witnesses – represented by the firm – ‘ dishonestly ’ accused @entity2 soldiers of war crimes in @entity142 because they were motivated by compensation			2
yesterday mr @entity96 said : ‘ this is a judgment of profound importance			0
it tells the @entity52 again that no matter how they try to avoid accountability for the @entity2 ’s actions abroad , international human rights law will apply and , thus , @entity2 personnel must act accordingly			1
’ but @entity155 , @entity156 mp for @entity157 , said : ‘ this is another illustration of what has gone wrong with our country			0
’ the four - day detention limit applies only to prisoners taken in @entity4			2
this is because the standard operating procedures of the @entity166 , the umbrella under which @entity2 armed forces serve in the country , sets a detention period of 96 hours			1
after this a prisoner must be released or handed to @entity4 authorities			0
@entity2 ministers authorised detention beyond this time in november 2009 , when it became clear that @entity2 courts were ready to ban prisoner handovers to the @entity4 because of the risk of torture			2
anywhere else in the world , detention periods would be likely to be set locally , but @entity2 forces would still have to comply with the human rights convention			1
@entity185 of the convention says detainees must be brought ‘ promptly ’ before a judge and given a trial within a ‘ reasonable time ’			0
a judge would decide what was ‘ prompt ’ or ‘ reasonable ’ .			0

mr @entity0 made the 117 - page @entity23 judgement yesterday
ruled that @entity2 soldiers may not hold enemies for more than 96 hours
this is because to do so would breach @entity4 prisoners ' human rights
it means @entity10 chieftains must be freed to fight again within four days
it followed claims brought by @entity10 commanders held in @entity4 jails
