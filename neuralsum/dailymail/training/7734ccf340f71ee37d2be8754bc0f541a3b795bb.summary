taking paracetamol has no effect on lower back pain despite being the treatment most widely recommended by doctors , according to a study			1
@entity6 is the first - line treatment for gps dealing with acute attacks of the most common form of back pain , while the @entity13 websites advises patients to take it			1
but a major trial shows the painkiller does not help sufferers recover more quickly , reduce their pain levels or improve their sleep or quality of life			1
taking paracetamol has no effect on back pain , according to a new study by @entity26 the research suggests advice and reassurance can do as much good for back pain patients as regular doses of paracetamol			1
this could include advising patients to rest and to improve their posture and reassuring them that they will get better			2
lower back pain is thought to affect two in five people at some point in their lives , being triggered by bad posture , bending awkwardly or lifting incorrectly			0
in many cases it gets better within 12 weeks , with sufferers taking painkillers and keeping mobile			2
despite universal advice to doctors about prescribing paracetamol to alleviate low back pain , there is no high - quality evidence which shows it works , according to @entity53 researchers			1
they carried out their study on 1,652 people with acute lower back pain in @entity58			0
the volunteers , who had an average age of 45 , were split into three groups			0
one group received regular doses of paracetamol three times a day for up to four weeks			0
they were given up to 3,990mg per day			0
another group received up to 4,000mg of paracetamol per day when required , and the third were given a placebo ( dummy pills )			2
the study found little difference in the number of days it took to recover between the treatment groups , with the placebo group having an average recovery time of 16 days , a day faster than the other two groups			1
@entity6 also had no effect on short - term pain levels , disability , function , sleep quality or quality of life , says to a report in @entity88 medical journal			1
@entity6 is the first - line treatment for gps dealing with acute attacks of the most common form of back pain according to study leader dr @entity95 , from @entity26 , paracetamol was effective in treating some acute pain such as tooth extraction and post-operative pain			1
but the study findings threw into doubt its role in treating low back pain			0
‘ simple analgesics such as paracetamol might not be of primary importance in the management of acute lower back pain , ’ he said			0
‘ the results suggest we need to reconsider the universal recommendation to provide paracetamol as a first - line treatment for low back pain , although understanding why paracetamol works for other pain states but not low back pain would help direct future treatments			2
in view of the quick time frame in which participants in our trial improved compared with other cohorts , it would be interesting to see whether advice and reassurance , as provided in our trial , might be more effective than pharmacological strategies for acute low back pain			1
’ but @entity127 experts @entity128 and @entity129 , from @entity130 in @entity131 , also writing in @entity88 , said it was too early to change clinical guidelines			0
they said : ‘ although the findings from this high - quality trial are clear , the content of guidelines should not be changed on the basis of a single trial ; more robust and consistent evidence , including verification of the results in other populations , is needed			2
’ @entity6 works by blocking prostaglandin enzymes in the brain and spinal cord involved in the transmission of pain			1
in addition to paracetamol tablets , the drug is available in many cold and flu remedies			0
in 2011 the @entity13 spent £ 61million on paracetamol for @entity90 ’ patients .			0
