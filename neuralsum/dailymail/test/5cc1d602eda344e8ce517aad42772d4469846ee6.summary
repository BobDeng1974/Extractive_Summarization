last year it was ' dare to @entity1 ' and 12 months on it seems to be ' @entity3 , ' following the launch of a brand new website			1
@entity1 has made the headlines throughout his trophy - laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32 - year - old striker			1
search engine @entity14 has immortalised the @entity15 forward with the site totally devoted to the @entity19 giants ' @entity17			1
@entity1 has had a search engine website created in his honour called @entity14 the website has an identical style to @entity24 with users given the option to ' @entity27 ' or ' i 'm feeling @entity1 ' in a house style that is identical to @entity24 , and operates just like the search engine , users have the option to ' @entity27 ' or ' i 'm feeling @entity1			1
' the click of the former button takes users to articles about @entity1 on @entity24 , while the latter directs them to his @entity37			1
in addition any results from the search bar will automatically add ' @entity1 ' to the front - meaning he will forever be at the forefront of the news			1
it must be said though that website is neither affiliated with @entity1 nor @entity24			1
the website though has no affliation with the @entity15 no 10 ( left ) nor @entity24 creative director of @entity49 , the agency that came up with the website idea , @entity47 hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the @entity54 international			1
' we did n't ask his permission , but we hope he sees it as an amusing experience , ' he said			0
' our search engine is linked to @entity24 but all the searches are @entity60			1
all the results have some link to @entity1 ... if you type in @entity65 , you 'll get stuff about @entity3 's @entity65 ; if you want a recipe , you 'll get the @entity68			1
' @entity1 is an idol			1
he 's known the world over			2
that 's why we chose him			2
' @entity72 , the agency that came up with the website idea , hope that @entity1 ( left ) will find it amusing as memorable as he can be with his feet , @entity1 can also do likewise with his tongue			1
@entity78 reminds you of 10 of the @entity54 international 's best quotes			0
' in my head i am the strongest of all			0
i certainly do n't need the @entity85 to prove that i am number one			0
' @entity1 may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 @entity85 award , but it clearly did n't affect the striker 's confidence in his own ability			1
' a @entity92 without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the @entity92			0
' @entity1 came up against @entity96 in the play - off to reach the @entity92 in @entity98 last summer , but it was @entity54 that were on the losing side and the @entity15 forward let everyone know there was n't much point in watching a tournament that did n't feature himself			1
' i could n’t believe it			0
i was like " no way , @entity1 does n’t do auditions "			2
' @entity109 revealed that he came close to signing @entity1 when he was a fresh - faced 16 - year - old but he refused to have a trial at the north @entity112 club			2
' as any man will attest to , buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task			0
not for @entity1 though , who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has @entity1			2
' well , i do n’t know			0
you ’ll have to ask your wife about that			0
' as a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing @entity1			2
this reporter was n't , and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face			0
' what @entity134 does with a football , i can do with an orange			0
' @entity1 did n't take too kindly to criticism from @entity140 counterpart and former @entity142 and @entity143 striker @entity134			2
' come to my house and you 'll see if i 'm gay , and bring your sister			0
' during his spell at @entity151 a picture emerged of @entity1 getting rather close to team - mate @entity152 but the @entity54 international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay , particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter			2
' it was the fault of @entity157 , who made me do one drink of vodka after another			0
i slept in the bathtub			0
now i hold my vodka much better			0
' @entity1 tried to pass the blame to former @entity165 team - mate @entity157 after reports of excessive behaviour following the club 's @entity169 title success			1
' i like fireworks too , but i set them off in gardens or kebab stands			0
i never set fire to my own house			0
' after @entity177 , a former team - mate of @entity1 's at @entity178 , set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window , the @entity15 hitman admitted his like for fireworks			1
' you bought a @entity65 but you drive it like a @entity185			0
' @entity1 's short and tumultuous stint in @entity187 with @entity151 was riddled with arguments and falling outs , particularly with manager @entity190 and the 33 - year - old was not happy with his role in the team .			1
