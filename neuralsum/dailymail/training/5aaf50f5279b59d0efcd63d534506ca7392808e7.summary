@entity0 may not be known for his close - quarter work at the breakdown but it was the @entity5 wing ’s late intervention which kept @entity8 ’ @entity7 hopes alive while simultaneously sinking @entity10 ’s			1
with the @entity13 ’ pack battering the visitors ’ line following a succession of penalties , @entity8 ’ season hung in the balance			1
but with seconds on the clock , and the ball centimetres short of the line , @entity0 did his finest impression of @entity24 to force his hands over the ball — possibly illegally — and persuade @entity28 referee @entity27 to penalise sale for holding on			1
@entity8 and @entity5 winger @entity0 ( right ) is tackled by @entity10 's @entity30 @entity8 ' @entity31 ( centre ) was on form for his return to the @entity8 line up with a win over @entity13 @entity37 tries to build up some momentum but is stopped in his tracks by @entity10 's @entity40 ( left ) ‘ i thought our defence in our 22 in the last five minutes was pretty heroic , ’ said relieved @entity8 director of rugby @entity41			1
‘ there were a lot of the characteristics i associate with this team which were present all the way through			0
our performance was n’t perfect but we showed a lot of energy			0
‘ @entity0 had a lot of good interventions today			1
there were several occasions when we had numbers down in defence and he came off his line and timed tackles magnificently			2
‘ his turnover at the end was pretty special but he had a great game			0
he does n’t often get the credit for those kind of things			0
’ @entity13 ' @entity66 evades @entity31 's clutches but is clipped by a scrambling @entity68 @entity41 ’s opposite number @entity70 , who berated @entity27 and his fellow officials after the final whistle , said : ‘ we were hammering their line , penalty after penalty			1
probably in the @entity78 we ’d have got a yellow card			0
‘ fair play to them			0
good defence in the last five minutes won them the game			0
they ’re a good side and they pushed the boundaries of offside quite a lot			0
there was probably a bit of inexperience from that referee coming out of the @entity95 and not being used to streetwise sides like @entity8			2
’ the match was billed as a battle of the fly - halves as @entity10 ’s @entity66 took on @entity31 , even though the latter lined up at inside - centre , with former sale stand - off @entity102 at 10 for @entity8			1
none of the three will look back on the match with any great fondness , although @entity31 scored a try and kicked an important 65th - minute drop goal to pull @entity8 four points clear after the hulking @entity40 had rumbled over from 15 metres to give @entity10 hope			1
@entity113 holds onto the ankle of @entity40 as his side hold onto a victory at the @entity117 @entity31 ’s try following a superb @entity102 break — aided by some woeful @entity10 defence — came after the impressive @entity121 had scored the first try of the match before the @entity123 10 was forced from the field with a shoulder injury six minutes before the break			1
@entity66 , meanwhile , will be frustrated by some sloppy kicking from hand and occasionally flaky defence			0
despite some neat touches from promising young full - back @entity132 and some thunderous tackling from centre @entity134 , it was left to @entity10 ’s forwards , with the @entity137 and @entity121 to the fore , to take the game to a @entity8 side struggling for any rhythm in @entity7 or domestically			1
@entity8 back row @entity142 tries to hold on to the ball as he collides at speed with @entity134 @entity37 keeps up the pressure as he fends off challenges from @entity66 ( left ) and @entity147 returning @entity5 lock @entity148 enjoyed another impressive afternoon ’s work for @entity8 , who must now beat @entity151 away and @entity152 at home to be confident of qualifying from the competition ’s toughest pool but they will need a much improved performance to stand a chance of progressing			2
they face @entity10 , whose interest in the tournament is now over , at @entity161 next week , when they will again be without centre @entity162 , who is expected to be out of action for four weeks after injuring his calf playing for @entity5 against @entity166 last week			2
@entity41 said : ‘ @entity162 pulled his calf in the last game for @entity5			0
it ’s hugely disappointing for us to lose him for four weeks when he comes back with a pretty significant injury like that			0
’ @entity173 is shown no love as he is dragged down by @entity113 and @entity31 ( left )			2

@entity8 winger @entity0 won a crucial late penalty for @entity8
the visitors were defending their line in the in the dying moments as @entity10 chased a match - winning try
sale scored tries through @entity121 and @entity40
@entity31 scored a try and kicked six points for the @entity190
