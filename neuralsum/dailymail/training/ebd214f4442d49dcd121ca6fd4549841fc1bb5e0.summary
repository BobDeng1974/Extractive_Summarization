by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 03:33 est , 26 november 2012 you ca n’t help but feel sorry for @entity2			1
imagine the come - down when you go from being the fastest thing on two wheels at the @entity6 to being the most wooden thing on two legs on @entity9			1
she must be one of the fittest women in the world so why she dances like she ’s on the @entity13 waiting list for a hip replacement is a complete mystery			2
after turning in a horribly stiff and awkward salsa on saturday @entity18 found herself , deservedly , bottom of the leader board with only 21 out of 40			2
@entity2 , pictured with partner @entity22 , was @entity9 's biggest signing of the year ' really something ' : @entity18 put on an awkward and stiff salsa for her final dance @entity18 must be dehydrated after all the tears she has shed on the show ‘ well , that was really something , ’ said @entity29 after her performance			1
that ‘ something ’ being a complete car crash			1
her hideous baby - pink satin dress and @entity38 make - up did n’t exactly help matters either			1
when @entity40 told @entity18 that the stage props had more fluidity than she did and awarded her a 4 it led to another mini-meltdown			0
it was no surprise when she ended up in the dance - off alongside @entity48 before being voted off last night			2
perhaps it ’s just as well that the judges sent her packing – @entity18 has spent so much of the past two months sobbing she must be dangerously dehydrated by now			0
but , even though she could n’t dance , she was @entity9 ’s biggest signing this year and it ’s a shame to see her go – not least because wondering how @entity54 will get another cycling pun into his critique had become compulsive viewing			0
at the other end of the scale is @entity61 who , unless her partner @entity62 continues to drop her on her head as he has been doing in rehearsal , is dancing all the way to the final			1
for the second week running she topped the leader board , scoring 37 out of 40 for her elegant , flowing @entity68			0
she even got a 10 from @entity69 , which seemed a tad @entity71 considering @entity61 herself admitted that she went wrong – but then nonsensical marking was the order of the day on saturday ’s show			1
@entity48 just stood there and thought of @entity75 as @entity76 gyrated around him of course , @entity61 ’s participation continues to cause controversy due to the fact she was a fantastic dancer from week one rather than a ropey one who got better with every week			1
it could be worse though , she could be dazzlingly brilliant one week yet so awful you have to watch through your fingers the next – like @entity48			0
while @entity48 is a natural at ballroom he just ca n’t find his dancing feet with the more passionate , upbeat numbers			2
on saturday he did an @entity88 – a dance that ’s meant to be full of jumps , kicks and flicks but during which he just stood rooted to the spot while his partner @entity94 used him like a human pole as she posed and gyrated around him			0
meanwhile fellow @entity96 came in for a right old rollicking from the judges for his @entity99			0
i hate it when they criticise @entity103 , his big , puppy - dog eyes fill with tears and you can see him swallowing hard so he does n’t lose control of his emotions			2
leave him alone ! in keeping with the judge ’s skew - whiff scoring , @entity109 was praised to the rafters and given 36 for a @entity113 even though he was out of sync with his partner for most of the routine			1
after ending up in the bottom two at @entity118 played the kiddie card and had his very photogenic children visit him at rehearsals			0
he also threw in a couple of their cute cousins for good measure			0
with half the contestants now gone the battle is really on and if @entity48 ’s three children do n’t decide to ‘ spontaneously ’ drop in on their daddy in rehearsals next saturday i ’ll be very surprised .			0
