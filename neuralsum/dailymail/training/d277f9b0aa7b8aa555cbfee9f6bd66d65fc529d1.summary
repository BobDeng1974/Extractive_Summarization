it went down in football history as one of the most infamous and controversial sending off incidents the game has ever seen - and would define the careers of all those involved			0
the year was 1991 and @entity6 are playing @entity7 in an @entity9 semi-final at @entity10			1
the opening 20 minutes had been bossed by the @entity7 , who played in the division below @entity6 and were clear underdogs			1
then came a moment that would alter the course of the match and the entire season , plus set a precedent that would change refereeing and the art of defending for ever			2
to everyone 's astonishment , referee @entity23 reached for his pocket and brandished a red card			1
@entity22 became the first - ever footballer to be shown a straight red card for denying an attacker a goal - scoring opportunity with a professional foul			1
it is a rule we 're all familiar with now , but back in 1991 @entity23 's decision took many by surprise and @entity22 is among many of a @entity7 persuasion who have never forgiven him			1
@entity6 went on to beat the 10 men 4 - 0 and advanced to the final against @entity54 at @entity55			1
now , 23 years later , the two men have been re-united and @entity22 still blames @entity23 for ruining @entity58 dream			2
@entity23 attempts to explain his decision to @entity22 , who took some persuasion to leave the field speaking in a video for you - are - the - ref.com , @entity22 said : ' i still probably think i would n't have got sent off nowadays and i still question the decision			1
' i just could n't believe it , you know			0
i could n't believe it would be someone like me getting in this kind of situation			0
' that was the only blot on my copybook and probably made me infamous			0
it might have made @entity23 famous but it made me infamous at the time and it was something that i thought was unforgivable			0
' and @entity22 goes further , saying he believes @entity23 wanted to make a name for himself : ' i thought it was a bit of an egotistical one at the time , in that @entity23 wanted to be the first one to make that decision			2
' @entity22 ( left ) is re-united with @entity23 ( right ) as you are the @entity82 presenter @entity81 keeps them in check @entity85 fires home @entity6 's second goal of the semi-final as @entity89 tries to stop him @entity90 breaks through the @entity7 defence to put @entity6 three - up at @entity10 @entity6 's @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 celebrate their passage to the final the defender , who made 300 league appearances for @entity7 between 1984 and 1994 , also believes his suspension led to @entity7 missing out on the second division championship			1
@entity23 insists @entity22 was the victim of new rules introduced by the @entity103 just a couple of days before the big match			1
he said : ' on the thursday , @entity105 at the @entity103 called all referees in to discuss this particular type of incident			0
the managers , even the referees below @entity111 level at that particular time were not aware of this interpretation			0
' if this incident happened a week before , @entity22 would n't have received a yellow card never mind a red			2
video : highlights of the match after @entity22 's sending off @entity22 in action for @entity7 against @entity122 of @entity54 the following season ' it ruined the game			1
it ruined it for the spectators and dare i say that i was n't happy myself and the culmination was i came into the car park after the game really unhappy , very unhappy in this particular decision			0
' i threw my bag into the car and there was an @entity103 guy there ... he tapped me on the shoulder and just said , " well done			0
if you had n't have sent him off you 'd have been suspended			0
" ' i always remembered that because i then had some choice words for him			0
i [ later ] had the death threats , which were taken quite seriously			0
' @entity23 added that he is still not in favour of the rule despite it being a well - established part of the game now			2
@entity54 went on to beat @entity6 in the final at @entity55 , winning the match 2 - 1 forest manager @entity151 , in iconic green jumper , leads his team out at @entity55 ' i still think that denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity is a bad law ... in the case of a defence inside the penalty area , you know , that denial of the goal is replaced by the penalty kick			1
' so it 's an offence where the punishment is a triple jeopardy - it 's dismissal , it 's a penalty and it 's a suspension and that ca n't be right			0
' @entity151 's @entity6 went on to lose 2 - 1 to @entity167 in the final but the controversy of @entity22 's red rumbles on to this day			1
you can see full exchange between @entity22 and @entity23 at you - are - the - ref.com â€“ the website for all matters connected to refereeing at all levels of the game .			2

@entity23 was refereeing the 1991 @entity9 semi-final between @entity6 and @entity7 at @entity10
on 22 minutes , @entity7 's @entity22 brought down @entity6 's @entity26 as he broke clear
@entity23 brandished a straight red card as @entity22 had denied a clear goalscoring opportunity
the rules had been changed a couple of days before to allow this
@entity22 still questions the decision , while @entity23 *regrets* it
@entity6 went on to win the match 4 - 0 and reached the final
