restaurateur @entity0 had food critics raving about the pizzas at the vip launch of his trendy new restaurant - until he confessed they were in fact frozen and bought from a local supermarket			1
@entity0 , 58 , had promised a ‘ taste of @entity9 ’ and a ‘ pizza with a real difference ’ at the bash at @entity13 in @entity15 ’s trendy @entity14			1
around 100 local foodies turned up at the first floor eaterie and were waxing lyrical over the free tasters including ' special ' @entity20 and @entity21			1
pizzas with a difference : @entity0 , 58 , had promised a ' taste of @entity9 ' and a ' pizza with a real difference ' at his vip bash to launch @entity13 but the penny dropped when a note was passed round later that night revealing the food was in fact @entity33 pizzas bought from the freezer from a nearby high street store for just £ 2.78 each			1
bizarrely the restaurant will be now serving the frozen pizzas until september 7 in the laid - back restaurant kitchen			1
two ‘ chefs ’ will prepare fresh salad and breadboards and then take the selected pizza out of its box and pop it in the oven			1
punters can grab their restaurant - cooked supermarket pizzas with a soft drink and side salad for £ 4 as part of a lunch special			1
@entity0 , who runs the venue as well as the @entity55 downstairs , said : ' we wanted to try and do something a bit different and we thought serving up supermarket pizzas would be a good idea to get people talking			1
' people took to @entity63 calling it the ' weirdest thing in the history of the @entity15 food scene '			0
restaurant manager @entity68 , right , with customer @entity69 , at the pizza restaurant in @entity15 's trendy @entity14 the vip guests were raving over these pizzas from a local high street store - frozen but nicely dressed up by restaurateur @entity0 and his team @entity0 added : ' we wanted to see if they could tell the difference between freshly cooked pizzas and frozen ones from stores			1
evidently people did n’t know the difference and were taken in because they loved it so much			2
' unfortunately some people at the launch were a little cross when they found out we were serving frozen supermarket pizzas			2
' but they were n’t complaining when it was free and they were going through 36 bottles of sparkling wine that i laid on			2
it was just a bit of fun and it did n’t cost anybody anything to try it			0
' i just liked the idea of doing something that nobody has ever done before			0
' in @entity101 downstairs , he prides himself on using the freshest @entity103 ingredients with dishes including the finest hung @entity103 beef and @entity107 black pudding			0
but with 33 years in the business , he has no regrets about duping critics into tucking into the bargain grub , at last week 's bash			1
back for more : guests loved the special ' taste of @entity9 ' until they discovered the pizzas were in fact frozen			1
but they 'll still be on the menu until september 7 he said : ' i had no intention to deceive			0
the pizzas are called @entity13 and we had dr @entity33 signs on the walls - it ’s just a bit of fun for a month and i think it ’s bloody good value			2
' great value , great service and in great surroundings - with no horse meat in sight			2
what more could you want ? ' these are the best frozen pizzas around and at least we know what ’s in them			2
i see people carrying boxes of burgers into restaurants and in big letters they say " contains only 30 % beef "			0
why does no - one ask what the rest is ? ' no complaints : the blackboard at the restaurant advertises ' unique deep bakery crust pizza with a base that is crispy on the outside , soft and light on the inside ' floor manager @entity68 , 22 , said : ' cooking frozen pizza is harder than it looks			1
the bases need to be crispy and they need to be cooked right each time , so it can sometimes be a little tricky , ' he said			0
' in terms of service and value we can definitely compete with the restaurants around here			0
it does n’t matter that the secret ’s out , that would defeat the object			0
we want to show that you ca n’t tell the difference between the dr @entity172 pizzas and proper restaurant meals			1
' at the launch most people were complimentary about the taste but we had a few who were a little angry because they felt they had been victims of a prank			0
' @entity63 contained mixed reaction when news of the restaurant was revealed			0
@entity182 said : ' this dr @entity184 stunt has to be the weirdest thing in the history of the @entity15 food scene			0
reading it all open - mouthed			0
' while @entity191 ’s @entity190 , a popular @entity15 takeaway and cafe tweeted : ' all this talk of dr @entity33 - why did n’t we just serve @entity196 ? '			0
