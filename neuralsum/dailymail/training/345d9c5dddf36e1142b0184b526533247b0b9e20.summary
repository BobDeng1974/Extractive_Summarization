' blood flowed out of me like a faucet , ' recalls @entity5			1
' i remember shifting in and out of consciousness and a firefighter standing in front of me with a blank look on his face and muttering the words to effect of " holy crap "			2
' my parents had arrived while i was being wheeled out			0
i remember telling them i loved them and saying good - bye to @entity7			0
i thought this was the last time she 'd see her mother alive			1
' second chances : @entity30 natives @entity5 and @entity31 ( pictured with their daughter @entity7 ) did n't want to give up on their dream to have a second child after a hemorrhage left her unable to conceive by the time she returned to her family home in @entity30 , @entity5 had received 18 bags of blood , three of plasma and had undergone four surgeries all in less than two weeks			1
but she 'd also had to have a hysterectomy			1
yes , i was lucky to be alive , but not being able to carry another baby was a huge loss			0
' @entity5 and her husband @entity45 - who had met during @entity5 's freshman year at @entity47 and married in 2006 - did n't want to give up on their dream to have a second child			1
so they started to research the idea of using a gestational carrier			1
' we both grew up with siblings , ' says @entity5 explaining their fervent quest for another child			1
costly : they started researching gestational carriers , but the costs involved came as a complete shock			1
' we have been given an estimate of $ 75,000 to $ 125,000 , ' says @entity5 ' we feel this is such an important relationship in a person 's life			1
having that sibling to go through life with is something we both feel is important			0
even before we met each other we both knew we wanted two children			0
' but the costs involved came as a complete shock - @entity5 works part - time as a realtor and her husband is a product designer			1

desperate times : that was how they hit on a novel idea			0
to let someone else name their unborn baby , for a price : $ 20,000 to be exact trade - off : ' an amount this large could make a huge impact for us on being able to move forward with this process			2
if the " sacrifice " we make is having a crazy baby name , we will take that , ' says @entity5 ' the costs will go up from there if it does nâ€™t work the first time			2
the cost can also go down from here if we find a carrier on our own			2
' that was how they hit on a novel idea			0
to let someone else name their unborn baby , for a price : $ 20,000 to be exact			2
the couple started a page on crowd funding platform indiegogo - offering incentives ( $ 150 for a year of new baby pictures , $ 25 for a thank you hug from them , ) to try to raise part of the mountain of cash it would take to try and have another child , as well as put out a plea for a surrogate			1
family love : ' having that sibling to go through life with is something we both feel is important			0
even before we met each other we both knew we wanted two children , ' she explained as for giving away naming rights , ' i put it in there to get a laugh out of people who were looking at our page , ' says @entity5			0
' however , if someone seriously wanted to take us up on it , we 'd be game			2
' an amount this large could make a huge impact for us on being able to move forward with this process			0
therefore , if the " sacrifice " we make is having a crazy baby name , we will take that in return for the addition of a life to our family			0
