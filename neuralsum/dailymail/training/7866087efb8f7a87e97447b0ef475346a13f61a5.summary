by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 13 september 2013 leadership material ? @entity2 signalled that he will back chancellor of the exchequer @entity3 as the potential next head of the @entity5 @entity2 signalled that he will back @entity3 as the next @entity7 leader yesterday as he warned @entity8 to ' cool it ' in his quest to replace @entity11			1
the @entity13 veteran said he was a ' big fan ' of the chancellor , who he said was ' playing a blinder ' on the economy and warned his rivals mr @entity3 ' is bound to be a contender '			1
mr @entity2 , who was chancellor in @entity20 's government , said with the economy finally beginning to improve : ' @entity3 has the chance of coming out with a quite remarkable outcome			1
' if he is the chancellor who can steer the country out of the kind of mess he inherited and demonstrate to people that in his term of office we turned ourselves into a competitive modern economy enjoying normality in our economic circumstances , then that would be a complete triumph			1
' in a shot across the mayor 's bows , mr @entity2 said mr @entity8 should not repeat his attention - grabbing performance at the last @entity7 conference , where the mayor was greeted as a near rock star , held a victory rally for his mayoral re-election and embarked on a series of high profile media appearances			1
mr @entity2 said : ' i gave some advice to @entity8 at last year 's conference and my advice to him was that if he has an interest in the leadership , he should cool it , " mr @entity2 said			2
' there is n't going to be a vacancy for some years			1
@entity11 - with all the usual good luck and health - is plainly good for a very long time			0
' the chances of @entity11 being prime minister after the next election are looking better than they have looked ever since we got in			0
' mr @entity8 is widely favoured to take over from mr @entity11 if he loses the next election			0
by contrast , @entity7 @entity60 judge mr @entity3 's chances of succeeding mr @entity11 to be higher if the prime minister wins in 2015 since he is so closely associated with the prime minister			1
asked to assess the prospects of both mr @entity3 and home secretary @entity66 as future leaders , mr @entity2 said : ' i think @entity3 is for every possible reason concentrating on getting the economy through this lot , and he is doing damn well so far			2
' if he does that , it is probably not doing too much damage to him to say he is bound to be a contender			2
' but mr @entity2 had nothing to say about the possible claim on the top job of mrs may , with whom he famously clashed over the case of an illegal immigrant who she said was spared removal from the country so he could stay with his cat			0
mr @entity2 , who first entered @entity87 in 1970 , revealed that he would be deciding within two weeks whether he will stand as a candidate in the general election scheduled for 2015			1
speaking to a @entity91 lunch , mr @entity2 indicated he was inclined to seek re-election , saying he remained interested in politics			0
but his wife has been unwell and he signalled that he will make a decision after discussions with his family and supporters			0
big beast : the @entity13 veteran , who was chancellor in the @entity102 government , said he was a ' big fan ' of the chancellor , who was ' playing a blinder ' on the economy and warned his rivals mr @entity3 ' is a contender ' mr @entity2 also said that the government has accomplished far more as a coalition that it would have if the @entity5 had won with a small majority in 2010			1
he also said while he initially thought a hung parliament would be a ' catastrophe ' , but has changed his mind			0
' we have delivered more than we could have as a single party government , ' he insisted			0
' the present government can say we have put national interest before party interest			0
we have formed a coalition			0
' if we had n't done that , heaven help us			2
i do think a coalition can achieve more in a time of crisis than a single party government , though i 'd like to move back to single party government as soon as possible			0
' we 've achieved more actually than we could conceivably have done as @entity7 government with a tiny majority			1
some @entity7 backbenchers , frustrated at what they see as a @entity134 block on conservative policies have argued mr @entity11 should have not entered a coalition			1
' what on @entity139 that was supposed to achieve i ca n't imagine , ' mr @entity2 said			2
he said such a minority government would have ' faffed around for six months ' while ' the world would have fallen around our ears ' .			0

@entity7 big beast says improving economy makes chancellor a contender
but he adds ' there is n't going to be a vacancy for some years '
*cabinet* veteran also reveals he will soon decide whether to stand in 2015
