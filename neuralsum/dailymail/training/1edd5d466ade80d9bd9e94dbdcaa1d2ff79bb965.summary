by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 23:16 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 31 october 2012 it could take the @entity5 subway system three full weeks to come back online , experts have warned			1
high water is preventing inspectors from quickly assessing damage , meaning the nation 's largest city could face an extended shutdown of the system that 5million people count on each day			1
@entity14 , chairman of the state agency that runs the subway , said service might have to resume piecemeal , and experts said the cost of repairs could be staggering			1
but a group of @entity40 researchers analysing the effects of a smaller hurricane or tropical storm suggest that it would shut down the subways for 21 days - and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars			1
the report by @entity47 , a geophysicist who specializes in disaster management , examined the effects on the city ’s transportation infrastructure of a 100 - year storm			1
dr @entity47 and his researchers used as a model a storm less powerful than a superstorm such as @entity57 – one that has only a one per cent chance of happening in any given year			2
@entity60 submerged : a man takes a photograph of the flooded @entity64 station as dozens were damaged by the storm surge that rose water levels by 13 feet then report estimated that a hurricane hitting nearby could result in a billion gallons of water flooding each of the subway ’s 14 tunnels that run under the @entity73			1
there has always been flooding in the tunnels , which collect storm water constantly , but the @entity77 said @entity57 was the worst disaster in the subway ’s 108 - year history			1
trains stopped running at 7pm on sunday as the @entity77 preemptively closed down service for only the second time in its history			1
the closure was an effort to secure the subway system against the impending storm , but massive damage came anyway			2
worst disaster : after several stations were damaged , including 86th street station , the @entity77 said the @entity92 was the worst disaster in the subway 's 108 - year history limited bus service began again yesterday and some bridges reopened at midday , but transit officials said they could not predict when the subway would run again			1
one tunnel – the @entity26 station at @entity101 's southern end – was flooded entirely from ' track to the ceiling '			1
more than 468 stations and 600 miles of track now have to be carefully examined			0
each tunnel was expected to take at least five days to pump dry after the tidal surge of almost 14 feet			0
the @entity109 ’ @entity108 deployed a team of engineers yesterday to support @entity5 colleagues in the ' unwatering '			0
preemptive effort : trains stopped running on sunday night in an effort to secure the subway system , including a emergency dam erected at @entity119 terminal the team were specially trained in @entity121 , where they dealt with the aftermath of @entity124 , and are preparing their large stock of pumps			1
water in the two vehicle tunnels receded slightly as the tide fell tuesday morning , but the massive pumps that will eventually empty the tubes were unable to immediately make headway because the places where they normally send water — the river and sewer system — remained so high , the outflow pipes in the pumping system were still submerged			2
' our pumps are working			0
it 's just that the water has no place to go , ' @entity77 spokeswoman @entity143 said			2
' we pump it out and it just comes back in			0
' once the water is removed , engineers must then examine the equipment to see how much corrosion damage was wrought by the salt water that soaked the switches , signals , electrical wires and stations			2
each has to be out of the water before it is touched and and any damage will have to be fixed before the system can be restored			2
pump flood waters : each tunnel is expected to take at leave five days to pump dry , keeping stations closed until saturday or sunday ' in the tunnels under the @entity73 , all the signal - and - control systems are underwater , and it is salt water , ' dr @entity47 told the @entity169			1
' it 's not just that it does n't work right now			0
it all has to be cleaned , dried , reassembled and tested			0
and we are not sure what the long - term corrosion effect might be			0
' i think we have come to the end of studies			0
what we need now is action			0
adding : ' we have to start thinking about how we redesign the system so this does n't happen again			0
' i do n't think anyone can sit back anymore and say , " i 'm shocked at this weather pattern			0
" there is no weather pattern that can shock me anymore			0
' @entity188 was canceled for a third straight day wednesday in the city , where many students rely on buses and subways to reach classrooms			0
mayor @entity34 has said that sunday ’s marathon will still take place , but even if runners are able to fly in , it will be difficult to get everyone to the starting line without a subway			2
dr @entity47 ’s 21 - day estimate covers the time it is predicted to take city workers to bring the subway system back to 90 per cent function .			1

the report examined the effects on the city 's transportation infrastructure after a 100 - year storm
the subway will be closed until at least saturday or sunday
it is only the second time in the subway 's 108 - year history that it has closed
the @entity221 has *drafted* in a team who worked on the clear - up after @entity124 in @entity121
workers are pumping water out on tunnels so they can examine damage
electrics will have to be fixed before service can resume
ten tunnels are flooded with @entity26 station completely full of water
