sonar scans have shown that the mysterious object could be a huge @entity3 anti-submarine weapon lost beneath the waves since @entity5 since its discovery at the bottom of the @entity9 in may 2011 , the anomaly has fascinated observers			1
the apparently man - made object sits at the bottom of the ocean , looking for all intents and purposes like a drowned @entity16 from the @entity18 movies			2
theories have ranged over its purpose since the @entity22 discovered the object on sonar scans			1
to some observers , it is a @entity28 - the ' @entity27 ' , while others speculate that it is a @entity3 anti-submarine defence , or a plug to the underworld			1
but according to one expert , the ' strange ' and ' mysterious ' object , as described by the team who found it , is nothing more than glacial rocks that have been dragged across the ocean floor			2
@entity41 , an associate professor of geology at @entity43 , was handed stone samples of the object for analysis			1
he said he believed he was seeing nothing more than normal rocks , and told live science : ' it 's good to hear critical voices about this ' @entity9 mystery			0
' what has been generously ignored by the @entity35 is that most of the samples they have brought up from the sea bottom are granites and gneisses and sandstones			2
' he told @entity49 that these are ' exactly what one would expect to see in a glacial basin , which is what the @entity9 is - a region carved out by glacial ice long ago '			0
the divers from @entity66 also gave @entity41 a single loose piece of basaltic rock , a type of rock that forms from hardened lava , which he told the website was ' out of place on the seafloor , but not unusual '			0
he said : ' because the whole northern @entity9 region is so heavily influenced by glacial thawing processes , both the feature and the rock samples are likely to have formed in connection with glacial and postglacial processes			1
' possibly these rocks were transported there by glaciers			0
' artist @entity84 , inspired by the story , created this artist impression , posted on @entity87 , of the anomaly deep under the @entity9 ' this device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery , ' said the dive team which discovered the strange structure but now former @entity94 naval officer and @entity5 expert @entity93 has revealed that the structure - measuring 200ft by 25ft - could be the base of a device designed to block @entity100 and @entity101 submarine movements in the area landing spot : the exact coordinates of the object have not been released , but it is confirmed to be somewhere at the bottom of the @entity108 in the @entity9 between @entity109 and @entity94 the sonar picture of the unidentified object resembles the famed @entity18 ship the @entity16 based on the scans , the object appears to be raised 10ft above the seabed and measuring 200ft by 25ft - but the scans have also been called into question			1
sonar - scanning expert @entity119 , from the @entity117 in @entity118 , told @entity120 : ' the sonar image has numerous artifacts in it that make it difficult to interpret , and i would not place too much confidence in any interpretation until a better processing is done and the details of the type of sonar and particulars are provided			0
' i 'm saying the data are lacking in resolution , detail and quantification			0
' one plausible explanation is that the formation is an anti-submarine base			2
@entity94 submarine officer , @entity93 said the object has the shape of a @entity144 submarine trap from the @entity5			1
these huge concrete structures were built to make navigation more difficult for @entity148 submarines			0
speaking to the @entity94 newspaper @entity149 , @entity93 said that similar concrete structures had been built by the @entity100 during @entity5 @entity93 says it is likely that the object is built from double - skinned concrete for the purpose of holding large steel wire mesh structures , expected to disturb the propagation of radar and other signals used by any nearby submarines			1
during the decades after the war , the wire mesh structures would have eroded away , leaving only the holes shown on the images provided by @entity164 hefty trajectory : the @entity94 diving team noted a 985 - foot flattened out ' runway ' leading up to the object , implying that it skidded along the path before stopping but no true answers are clear the team did get some pictures , such as these soot - covered rocks that encircled an egg - shaped hole which went into the object at its center , and have no idea what any of it means			0

object ' is raised about 10 to 13ft above seabed and *curved* at the sides like a *mushroom* '
theories on *origins* range from downed @entity28 , to forgotten @entity5 base , or *meteorite*
but experts say rock samples point to natural rock formation
