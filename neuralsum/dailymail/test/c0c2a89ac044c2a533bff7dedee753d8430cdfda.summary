the other day i was driving past the port at @entity2 and i saw all those thousands of cars lined up on the quayside – and whoa … i did a double take			2
there they were : phalanx upon phalanx of shiny new vehicles glinting like @entity12 toys in the sun ; and i suddenly realised that they were n’t arriving in this country			2
these cars had n’t just disembarked from @entity17 or @entity18 or @entity19			2
they were about to make their own journey overseas – they were @entity24 cars , for goodness sake			2
they were examples of @entity24 manufacturing and design and engineering – and they were about to be loaded on to ships and taken to other @entity33 countries , and to @entity34 , and @entity35 ; and i reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country			2
across the @entity45 – and indeed across the country – there are now literally thousands of businesses , large and small , that are engaged in automotive innovation and supply ; and there was a time when no one would have believed that was possible			2
you , too , may remember that mullet - haired decade			0
the music was superb , the food was mediocre , and @entity24 industry was on its knees			0
i remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of ‘ conveners ’ and ‘ shop stewards ’ , and when the man who ran @entity66 – then our biggest car company – appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called @entity69			1
when i was a child i am afraid to say that @entity24 cars were the butt of international derision			0
they leaked oil , and they were generally assembled with such slovenly imprecision they gained a reputation for unreliability that it has taken decades to shake off			0
@entity81 after lemon rolled off our production lines , culminating in the ludicrous rustbucket called the @entity84 – and there was a reason for the disaster			0
@entity88 : the problem with @entity90 is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s we had atrocious relations between management and unions , and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions			1
we had a @entity99 government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market , or the desires of their customers – but to satisfy the rights of their workers			1
we had an era of tea breaks and ‘ demarcation disputes ’ and closed shops and one - out - all - out strikes , with the @entity99 government trying to impose such insane solutions as @entity114 ’s communist - style motorbike ‘ collective ’ at @entity115			1
it did not work then , and it seems to me to be deranged that we could be even contemplating going back to such arrangements now			0
i am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the @entity99 manifesto is my former adversary @entity119 , who has long been on the @entity114 wing			1
by @entity90 ’s own admission , @entity119 has been a big influence in his thinking – and in their return to the @entity114 / @entity119 approach @entity99 ’s plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise			1
@entity90 is turning the @entity99 sharply back to the @entity132 , and actively repudiating the chief insight of @entity134 – that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy			1
that is why @entity24 business people are so unanimous in their horror , including many former @entity99 supporters and donors			1
@entity99 wants to hit small - and medium - sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance – but it is worse than that			1
' i am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the @entity99 manifesto is my former adversary @entity119 ' they want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s , in which management was deprived of the ability to manage			1
they want to make it easier for employees to take firms to employment tribunals – when you might think the system was already out of control , with people endlessly and automatically and indeed very often vexatiously claiming racial or sexual or age or disability discrimination			0
they want all companies with more than 50 employees to have a system of profit - sharing – a return to @entity172 – and they want the workers to be able to block takeovers			0
that is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the @entity180 , higher income tax , and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with – the result of @entity99 ’s failure to tackle the deficit			1
what makes this anti-capitalist agenda so dangerous is that the @entity24 motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms			0
we are talking about huge numbers of often tiny companies – firms that pride themselves on making a more efficient windscreen - wiper or a quieter air - conditioning unit or a more easily wipeable dashboard fascia			0
it is incredible but true that @entity24 now has more specialised motor manufacturing marques than any country on earth – @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity2 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 … the list goes on			0
think of @entity211 ’s new hop - on hop - off @entity209 , a glorious piece of low - carbon technology and one of the greenest new buses on the market – made in @entity217 by @entity218			0
the @entity45 is once again the epicentre of one of the world ’s densest ecosystems of motor manufacturing and development			0
@entity24 brands have shed their 1970s reputations ; they are taking on the world and winning			0
how mad , how tragic , that this extraordinary @entity24 triumph should be faced with a @entity99 government that regards capitalism as ‘ predatory ’			1
the problem with @entity90 is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie – in fact i totally sympathise on that one			1
the problem with @entity90 is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s , writes @entity88 the problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time , though he did			1
he and @entity240 were at the controls in @entity242 when this country experienced the worst economic catastrophe in living memory – a catastrophe that was gravely exacerbated by their irresponsible fiscal policies			2
the problem with @entity90 is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s			1
he genuinely thinks @entity17 is the model we should emulate , when the @entity17 – whatever the splendours of their civilisation – have 12 per cent unemployment , and when huge numbers of the most talented @entity17 people have decided that they wish @entity17 was more like @entity24			0
how many brits work in @entity257 ? 16,000			0
how many @entity17 men and women live and work in @entity211 ? about 400,000			0
that should tell @entity90 all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies			1
@entity99 wants to go back to the 1970s , @entity268 to some non-existent version of a monochrome 1950s , the @entity265 would like to go back to the middle of the stone age , and the @entity271 would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls			1
there is only one party presenting itself for election on may 7 that seems to believe in the genius of this country , and that has a plan to take it forward			0
the @entity271 under @entity281 would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls it is only the conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those @entity24 cars lined up at @entity2			1
they are n’t the results of an evil and predatory system , by which workers are exploited and the boss class luxuriate in ever greater privilege			0
they are the fruits of a long and painful post-war period in which @entity24 has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete , and that we can not hope to compete if we over-tax and over-regulate in the way that @entity90 is proposing			1
those @entity24 - made vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the @entity99 - made disaster of 2008 - 9 , in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars ; an economy that has seen the creation , since 2010 , of about two million jobs			1
and those glistening @entity24 cars at the @entity2 docks therefore embody the great moral purpose of wealth creation – because it is only if you have a strong and vibrant economy that you can hope to raise the tax to pay for roads and schools and hospitals and pensions and welfare – not to speak of strong defences – and all the other civilised objectives that we want to meet			0
i really do n’t think @entity90 gets that			2
he is one of those theoretical socialists who thinks the problem with socialism is it has never been properly tried ; and i am horrified at the idea he should be given another go			0
there is only one party presenting itself for election on may 7 that believes that on the whole today is better than yesterday , and tomorrow is going to be better than today			0
that is @entity337 and the conservatives			2
we need five more years to entrench this economic recovery , five years to take this country forwards and not backwards			1
that is the @entity344 next month , and one this country ca n’t afford to lose .			2

@entity88 issues rally cry to defeat @entity90 in ‘ @entity348 ’
@entity350 has warned that @entity99 victory next month would be ' mad '
he says conservatives need five years to ' entrench the economic recovery '
