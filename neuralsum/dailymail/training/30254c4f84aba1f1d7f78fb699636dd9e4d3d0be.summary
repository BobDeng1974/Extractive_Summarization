' it actually felt a little bit like @entity44 - i had lots of people saying to me they do n't normally vote , or they normally vote conservative or @entity81 , but they look at this guy reckless … and i think things are going okay there			0
' the fact is that @entity7 is the 271st most @entity6 - y seat in the country , and if we can win there , it looks like we 're nine points ahead – it 's a tough fight and i think we can do it then it means things are going to look significantly different			1
' he added : ' let 's keep a sense of perspective			0
we have won a single seat			0
there are 300 - and - something to go to get a majority			0

what we have seen is a simple truth			0
this just puts @entity127 closer to victory			0
this has just made his job of getting into @entity146 easier			0
' @entity6 have risen dramatically in the polls since april 2012 when they languished on 9 % with little hope of an mp a new nationwide poll shows support for @entity6 has soared to an all - time high 25 per cent – in theory enough for the party to take 128 seats in the @entity20			2
the @entity157 poll for @entity58 had @entity81 and the @entity26 tied on 31 per cent , and the @entity158 languishing on 8 per cent			0
according to @entity160 , professor of politics at @entity162 , the poll would give @entity81 253 mps , conservatives 187 , @entity6 128 , @entity158 11 , and others , including @entity167 @entity166 and @entity169 mps , 71			2
prof @entity160 said : ' if @entity6 are to turn votes into @entity20 seats in @entity123 's first - past - the - post system , they need to build up bastions of local strength			1
today 's poll suggests they may have begun to do that			0
' the 25 per cent level represents a 22 - point increase on the three per cent the party won in 2010			0
if that increase were to occur evenly in every constituency , they could still fail to pick up a single seat			0
' but today 's poll suggests @entity6 's support has increased much more in the @entity184 outside @entity185 than it has elsewhere in the @entity123 – by a staggering 34 points			2
' if that level was recorded throughout the @entity184 , @entity6 could win as many as 128 seats , with no less than 102 of them coming from the conservatives , whose vote in the region is down 14 points			0
' in that event , @entity1 would be left with just 187 seats , almost as weak a position as the @entity5 were in after their calamitous defeat in 1997 .			1
