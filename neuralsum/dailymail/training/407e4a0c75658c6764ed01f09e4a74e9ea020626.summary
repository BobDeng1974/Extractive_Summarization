by @entity0 shift : new @entity3 chief executive @entity2 will urge more treatment of patients in their communities the new boss of the @entity3 is calling for the return of cottage hospitals			1
@entity2 , chief executive of @entity11 , said @entity12 had suffered from too much centralisation			1
in a major speech next week , he will urge more treatment of patients within their communities and a move away from the large impersonal hospitals which currently dominate the country ’s health landscape			1
the move would be a major u-turn on the health policies of recent governments			1
mr @entity2 said that @entity12 hospitals had become some of the worst in western @entity27 and that the @entity3 should look to other countries for ways to improve the healthcare system			1
he said : ‘ a number of other countries have found it possible to run viable local hospitals serving smaller communities than sometimes we think are sustainable in the @entity3			1
most of western @entity27 has hospitals which are able to serve their local communities , without everything having to be centralised			2
’ cottage hospitals were originally envisioned as smaller buildings in communities which stopped people having to travel long distances for treatment in larger hospitals where they were all but anonymous			1
instead , they would be treated locally			2
in recent years , many have been closed or phased out in favour of huge general hospitals which , it is argued , can be run more efficiently with economies of scale			2
critics claim patients are swallowed up by the system and in many cases do not receive care that is sufficiently designed to meet their needs as an individual			0
mr @entity2 said the @entity3 needed to abandon its fixation with ‘ mass centralisation ’ and instead invest in community services to care for an ageing population			2
he also revealed that he felt @entity66 ’s waiting time target culture had become an ‘ impediment ’ to care in many cases			0
mr @entity2 , a 47 - year - old @entity69 , gave up a lucrative private healthcare job in @entity71 to work for the @entity3 in the £ 211,000 - a year - role , for which he is taking a voluntary ten per cent pay cut			0
poisoned chalice : the @entity3 top job saw mr @entity2 's predecessor dubbed ' the man with no shame ' he will give a major speech next wednesday laying out his vision for the organisation			1
the job is regarded in some quarters as a poisoned chalice			0
his predecessor , sir @entity86 , was dubbed the ‘ man with no shame ’ over his refusal to take responsibility for various @entity3 scandals , most damagingly the neglect of patients at @entity94			0
mr @entity2 said he believes the biggest question facing the @entity3 is how best to support older people , pointing out figures which show that two - thirds of hospital patients are over retirement age – yet services are not designed around their needs			0
condemning the lack of ‘ dignity and compassion ’ with which vulnerable older patients are treated , mr @entity2 told the @entity107 that care failings often occurred because systems were not designed around their needs , and called for local services to be expanded			0
‘ you can not have a modern health service that is not treating older patients with dignity and compassion , supporting them at home and ensuring targeted prevention [ of ill health ] , ’ he said			0
vulnerable patients are frequently ending up in hospital because they had not received basic help when they needed it , resulting in falls and other avoidable incidents , he suggested .			0
