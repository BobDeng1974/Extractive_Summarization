it cost six million dollars to create bionic superhero @entity1			1
scientists however have built a man from artificial limbs for a sixth of the price			1
known as @entity7 – short for robotic exoskeleton – his 6ft frame is made up of an array of artificial limbs and organs from around the world			1
research on advanced prosthetics and artificial organs means scientists could soon not only replace missing body parts , but improve on them in the @entity1 astronaut @entity1 , played by @entity32 , was left horribly injured after his craft crashed			1
the opening sequence of the 1970s tv series featured an off - camera voice intoning : ‘ gentlemen , we can rebuild him			2
’ @entity1 was given a bionic arm and legs and an artificial zoom - lens eye			1
he has the technology : dr @entity43 , who has a bionic limb , has a drink with @entity7 the @entity48 programme ’s presenter is dr @entity43 , a social psychologist from @entity49 who himself has a £ 30,000 bionic limb after being born without a left hand			1
he said : ‘ it ’s exciting and a bit scary			2
we might be at a point in science and technology where we see first glimpses of the possibilities to go beyond the limits of evolution			2
’ how to build a bionic man is on @entity23 on february 7			1
read more in this week 's @entity63 @entity64 , professor of bioethics and human rights at @entity67 , warned : ‘ i think when it comes to our bodies , the danger is we might change what it is to be human			2
‘ create a new species that may turn around to bite us , similar to the @entity76 myth , where your creature let loose in the world becomes destructive and uncontrollable			0
’ the bionic man is being built from $ 1,000,000 ( £ 640,000 ) of limbs and organs by leading @entity84 roboticists @entity85 and @entity86			1
there is the artificial eye , which consists of a microchip implanted into the retina that receives images captured by a camera housed on the patient ’s glasses			0
it sends electrical pulses that are translated by the brain into shapes and patterns			0
professor @entity100 , from @entity101 , said : ‘ we are hoping patients who are completely blind will be able to see basic shapes and objects			0
’ scientists are hoping prosthetic replacements for failing hearts , kidneys , pancreas and spleens could one day solve the worldwide shortage of donor organs			0
one example , the @entity115 artificial heart is already saving lives , with more than 1,000 implanted			0
powered by a battery , it can temporarily replace a diseased heart until a donor is found			0
a prosthetic foot and ankle – developed by @entity125 professor @entity124 , who lost his legs to frostbite in a climbing accident – mimics the actions of the calf muscle and achilles tendon			0
the professor said he was now able to climb better than before his accident			0
how to build a bionic man is on @entity48 on thursday , february 7			1
read more in this week ’s @entity63 , out today .			0

built for a @entity23 documentary , @entity7 the bionic man raises ethical dilemmas
the programme 's presenter , dr @entity43 , has a £ 30,000 bionic limb after he was born without a left hand
