@entity1 's attorney - general has claimed that @entity3 duo @entity2 and @entity4 will be put to death following the rejection of their last ditch legal appeals			1
the convicted @entity10 drug dealers learned about the ruling after an appeal against their death row sentence was allowed to proceed in @entity15 's state administrative court on monday			2
the court decided against allowing the pair 's lawyers to challenge @entity1 president @entity20 's decision to deny the two @entity10 clemency			1
' no , there shall be no more ( delays ) , ' he said after monday 's verdict			0
' this is proof of their tendency to delay ... it 's like toying with law			0
' the attorney - general argued clemency was a matter of presidential prerogative only			1
' for me it 's enough			0
it 's finished , ' he said			0
lawyers for the men now plan to challenge the constitutional court to outline the president 's obligations in clemency			0
they argue the executions should be stayed pending the new action , to be filed this week			0
the unusual appeal in the state administrative court was likely the pair 's last legal avenue to save them from the firing squad for their part in the 2005 @entity3 heroin smuggling bid			2
@entity67 men @entity2 , 31 , and @entity4 , 33 , have been awaiting execution on the death island of nusakambangan with seven other prisoners after they were transferred from their home of almost ten years – @entity74 's notorious @entity73 prison – in a dramatic show of force last month			1
no sparing : a judge ( pictured ) in the @entity1 state administrative court ( pictured ) reads out the decision in @entity15 on monday ruling that @entity74 9 ringleaders @entity2 and @entity4 will not be allowed to challenge the decision by president @entity20 to deny the @entity10 clemency shackled and handcuffed : @entity2 and @entity4 cut sad figures as they were escorted by four faceless @entity1 police officers across the tarmac after being taken from @entity90 prison in @entity74 to their final destination , @entity92 the federal government has also asked that new legal options be allowed to run their course			1
foreign minister @entity96 said the government was disappointed by the court verdict			0
' both men have undergone extensive rehabilitation and i will continue to make representations to my counterpart , just as @entity10 will continue to use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution , ' ms @entity96 said in a statement			2
' again , the @entity10 government respectfully requests the president to review their pleas for clemency			2
' the court in february rejected their legal challenge for clemency , determining the decrees by president @entity20 were not within its jurisdiction			0
lawyer for @entity2 and @entity119 last week said they had done their best for their @entity10 clients			2
president @entity20 ( pictured ) previously rejected the @entity10 pair 's clemency bids without studying the individual merits of each case , lawyers for the @entity74 9 duo argued in the last ditch appeal on monday the pair are currently being held in isolation on nusakambangan prison island ( above ) where foreign drug dealers were executed on january 18 this year and where the two @entity10 may be shot dead by firing squads on the same night as nine other drug dealers family members of @entity10 death row prisoners @entity2 and @entity4 ( pictured ) leave nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners in @entity140 or ' stone ' prison on march 9 this year on sunday , @entity15 's catholic archbishop , @entity143 , told reporters he was saddened by @entity1 's use of the death penalty , which he described as a ' failure of humanity '			1
also distressing for the archbishop was the severe treatment of @entity2 and @entity4 when they were moved last month from their @entity74 jail cells to nusakambangan , which involved a fighter jet escort			1
' these men were handcuffed , was it necessary to be guarded by @entity159 ? ' he told reporters after his @entity162 service			0
surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return , 33 - year - old @entity10 @entity4 looks up at @entity74 police commissioner @entity166 who posed with the two condemned @entity10 before their take off from @entity169 airport for the two hour flight to ' death island ' a smiling @entity166 , the police commissioner of the @entity74 capital of @entity169 , poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner @entity2 inside the plane before take off for the @entity10 @entity3 kingpin 's final flight to the island where he will be executed ' for me that 's not strictness , for me that 's very saddening because it 's obvious that power wants to show itself and human dignity is not cherished			1
' @entity15 is awaiting all of the 10 prisoners in line for the firing squad to run out of options for court appeals before setting a date for their executions			0
@entity4 and @entity2 are facing execution alongside @entity198 woman @entity197 , @entity200 citizen @entity199 , @entity202 citizen @entity201 and the only @entity1 citizen among the group @entity205			1
also facing the firing squad with the two @entity10 is @entity207 , a @entity208 holding a @entity210 passport , @entity212 citizen @entity211 and @entity208 citizens @entity214 and @entity215			0
