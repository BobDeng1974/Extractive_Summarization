by @entity0 for @entity1 daredevil tourists are lining up to visit @entity4 ’s largest volcano as it begins to display evidence that a small eruption has occurred			2
a 5.0 magnitude earthquake rocked @entity9 today as scientists boarded a reconnaissance flight to get a better view of deep ‘ cauldrons ’ that have formed in a glacier that conceals the rumbling volcano			1
the @entity16 said the depressions developed as a result of an ice melt that may have been caused by a sub-glacial eruption , but it is not known when it may have occurred			1
there are fears that an eruption could disrupt air travel over @entity36 , but @entity4 ’s meteorological office says there is no evidence that a large eruption is underway			2
the country ’s aviation alert level remains at orange after it was briefly raised to red – its highest level – last weekend when a possible eruption was reported			0
@entity9 is located under @entity4 ’s largest glacier and it has been rocked by thousands of earthquakes for nearly two weeks			1
more than 400 earthquakes were detected between midnight and 6am today			0
the strongest one yet occurred tuesday morning with a magnitude of 5.7			0
the @entity54 glacier , which covers the @entity9 volcano , is pictured in this file photo grounded : passengers look at a flight board displaying dozens of cancellations during the @entity26 crisis while airlines remain on alert and travellers nervously book flights , @entity62 - based travel company @entity61 has received plenty of its interest in its ‘ volcano hotline ’			1
