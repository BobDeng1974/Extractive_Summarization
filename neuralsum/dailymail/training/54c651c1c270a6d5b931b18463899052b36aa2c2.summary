by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 16:44 est , 20 september 2012 a footballer who posted a homophobic message about @entity3 and his @entity5 diving partner @entity4 will not face the courts			1
the message sent by @entity10 , who plays for @entity11 in @entity12 , was ' not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought ' , @entity7 the @entity8 said today			1
the offensive tweet , which was deleted , appeared online after @entity3 , 18 , and @entity15 , finished fourth in the 10m synchronised dive this summer			1
troll : @entity19 's medal winner @entity3 was abused by a @entity21 footballer - but he will not face any charges investigation : no charges were brought because the tweet was not ' grossly offensive ' and @entity3 ( pictured ) was not meant to see it it came as a man , 22 , was arrested for setting up an offensive @entity30 page relating to the murder of two @entity33 policewomen on tuesday , where he called suspect @entity35 a ' legend '			1
mr @entity7 said that @entity10 had expressed remorse and taken ' reasonably swift action ' to remove the message and that because human rights law also gave people the right to ' offend , shock and disturb ' others prosecution was not appropriate			1
policy : @entity47 , director of public prosecutions , announced the decision and also new guidelines to frame social media prosecutions it was only meant to be seen by the @entity11 's friends and family , and was not sent directly to the divers			1
mr @entity7 added : ' this was , in essence , a one - off offensive @entity59 message , intended for family and friends , which made its way into the public domain			1
' it was not intended to reach mr @entity3 or mr @entity4 , it was not part of a campaign , it was not intended to incite others and mr @entity10 removed it reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse			1
against that background , it was not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought			1
' @entity10 was suspended by @entity11 but is now playing for them again			1
the announcement — which is likely to be welcomed by civil liberties campaigners — came as mr @entity7 announced new legal guidelines are to be drawn up over when charges will be brought over abuse on @entity59 and other social media sites			1
he said he planned to set a ' high threshold ' for launching criminal action against people who post offensive tweets in recognition of the ' spontaneous ' way in which people used social media			2
mr @entity7 said he wanted to consult the public before drawing up the guidelines , which were needed because of the ' clear difference ' between the way that people used social media sites and other forms of communication and because of the vast number of messages posted ' instantaneously ' that reached millions of people when they were only intended to be read by a few			1
the @entity8 warned that criminal action would still be needed to ' prosecute serious wrongdoing ' in any future cases involving “ sustained harassment ” or the posting of ' grossly offensive or threatening remarks ' on @entity59 or other social media sites			1
but he wanted to ensure that the ' fundamental right to free speech ' was respected			0
shocking : diving star @entity3 reacts angrily after he was sent an abusive tweet following his disappointment at missing out on a medal abuse : this shows the original tweet which was sent to @entity3 by @entity116 he added : ' the cps has the task of balancing the fundamental right of free speech and the need to prosecute serious wrongdoing on a case by case basis			1
that often involves very difficult judgment calls			0
@entity116 pictured at 14 : his family say he needs help ' in some cases it is clear that a criminal prosecution is the appropriate response to conduct which is complained about			0
' but in many other cases a criminal prosecution will not be the appropriate response			0
if the fundamental right to free speech is to be respected , the threshold for criminal prosecution has to be a high one			0
' the @entity8 said he would now draw up interim guidelines for prosecutors on when charges should , or should not , be brought before holding a ' wide public consultation ' ahead of the publication of finalised rules			1
police have admitted they are being dragged into too many @entity59 disputes as a row raged over the decision to arrest a different youth who abused @entity5 diving star @entity3			1
officers swooped on the home of @entity116 , 17 , at 2.45am last month hours after he told the sports star he had ‘ let down ’ his late father in the @entity156 synchronised ten metre final			2
@entity116 also threatened to ‘ drown ’ the 18 - year - old but backtracked and apologised when his messages provoked an online storm			2
@entity161 police handed the troubled teenager a formal harassment warning , police leaders claimed forces are being dragged into too many petty social media rows			0
inspiration : @entity3 's father @entity168 , left , died in may last year following a long battle with cancer and was a major driving force behind the teenager 's success officers were asked to look at content 14,000 times on @entity30 alone last year and @entity177 , vice-chairman of the @entity178 , which represents rank and file officers , said forces do not have the resources to monitor the internet			2
he said : ‘ there is legislation which concerns causing harassment , alarm or distress			0
but can we police the internet when someone upsets someone else ? ‘ i do n’t think we have the resources to do that			0
we ca n’t have a free - for - all online but we can not involve the police every time something unpleasant is said			2
’ since @entity59 's huge boom in popularity in @entity19 there have been a number of cases that have tested the boundaries of the current @entity204 , which polices the online world			1
no case sums up the flaws in the system more than the now infamous @entity59 joke trial where the @entity210 ruled that telling jokes about blowing up an airport is not a crime			2
and now just two months on @entity7 has moved to try to clarify the law which has left some victims of trolls unprotected and others unfairly targeted by the police and the courts			2
in the landmark ruling in late july , lord judge overturned the conviction of a frustrated airline passenger who tweeted that he meant to blow up the airport			0
@entity225 , 28 , had been convicted of sending a menacing message even though he broadcast his joke in his own name and no one at @entity230 in @entity231 took it seriously			0
the @entity233 took him to court under the 2003 @entity204 , and @entity231 magistrates told him to pay £ 600 costs , a £ 385 fine and £ 15 victim surcharge			2
the conviction in may 2010 was later upheld by a @entity239 judge			0
bu the lord chief justice said a joke could not by definition be menacing : ‘ if the persons who receive and read it , or may reasonably be expected to receive it , or read it , would brush it aside as a silly joke , or a joke in bad taste ... it would be a contradiction in terms to describe it as a message of a menacing character			0
’ the ruling was hailed as a victory for free speech and a rebuke to over-zealous police and lawyers			0
mr @entity225 , from @entity262 , @entity263 , lost his job as an administration manager after he was convicted and said he had become unemployable because of the prosecution			0
he sent his tweet when snow shut the airport in january 2010			0
it said : ‘ @entity230 is closed			0
you ’ve got a week and a bit to get your s * * * together otherwise i am blowing the airport sky high ! ! ’ he said after the ruling : ‘ it ’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do – telling a joke sometimes , even if it ’s a bad one			0
’ the judges noted there was no evidence before the @entity239 to suggest any of the followers of the ' tweet ' , or anyone else who may have seen it posted on mr @entity225 ’ timeline , found it to be of a menacing character or , at a time when the threat of terrorism was real , even minimally alarming .			0
