others depict the animal cuddling up to mr @entity10 , ' hugging ' him from behind , and another surfer riding past sporting an amazed expression			2

' mr @entity10 said : ' he spent well over an hour on my board ... you see those pups around this time of year ' nearly 2,000 seas lions have washed up on shores in @entity6 in sick and starving conditions so far this year the @entity80 has sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups it comes as @entity6 remains in the midst of a sea lion pup crisis , with nearly 2,000 of the animals having washed up on the state 's shores in sick and starving conditions so far this year			1
last week , the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups , saying there has been ' an unusually large increase ' in sea lion strandings			2
in january and february , strandings were 20 times the average rate for the time of year			0
in a conference call with reporters , an @entity80 official said that up to march 15 , more than 1,800 sea lions had been recorded , 750 of which were brought into the group 's facilities , to be fed back up			0
the pups were also treated for any health problems before being released back into the ocean			0
other pups have been cared for - and eventually returned to the wild - by @entity110 trainers in the region			0
while mr @entity10 was with the pup , his friend @entity50 was snapping photos of the unique encounter experts believe warming ocean temperatures are partly responsible for the enormous rise in sea lion strandings speaking to @entity39 , mr @entity10 said the pup that jumped on to his board on sunday morning did not appear malnourished and was comfortable around him , so may have been a rehabilitated sea lion			1
experts believe warming sea temperatures are at least , in part , responsible for the enormous rise in sea lion strandings , changing the availability of fish and other organisms on which sea lions prey			0
female sea lions , which weigh some 100 kilos ( against some 400 kg for males ) , have to swim further to find food , leading them to become prematurely separated from their pups			0
the next two months are likely to see an even greater surge in strandings , along the lines of a 2013 @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , experts say , before hopefully the numbers will start to fall			0
@entity143 of @entity80 said one piece of good news was signs of northerly winds which would help bring colder waters more rich in nutrients , at least in northern @entity6			0
this could ease the food crisis which is driving the strandings , he said			0
mr @entity10 said the little sea lion that jumped on to his board on sunday morning did not appear malnourished			1
