by @entity0 published : 22:47 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 31 july 2013 a damning study by @entity2 has found that pupils are getting less than two hours of @entity5 lessons a week			1
the education select committee questioned more than 300 primary and secondary school teachers , less than half of whom claimed that school children have two hour of sports education each week			1
just 43 per cent said pupils enjoyed two hours of physical work a week , compared to 90 per cent in the academic year 2007 - 2008 , when the sports survey was carried out under @entity15 's government			1
teachers ' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant @entity5 was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable the figures suggests that since the @entity27 came to power in 2010 , the number of children having at least two hours worth of sport lessons has halved , the @entity22 reported			1
the @entity22 reported that teachers ' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant @entity5 was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable			1
but the @entity33 said to compare with it the survey conducted in 2008 was ' ridiculous ' because the earlier study spoke to more than 21,000 schools and asked different questions			2
a spokesman said : ' it is ridiculous to compare a scientific research study of more than 21,000 schools to a self - selecting survey of just over 300 , and each with completely different questions			1
' the survey comes after comments made by @entity46 , the head of the @entity47 , earlier this year			0
the @entity27 has emphasised it 's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting @entity52 legacy she claimed that many children starting secondary school were unable to throw a ball , catch , jump or run			2
she said that even pupils inspired to take up a sport after watching the @entity52 missed out because teachers were not well trained enough to help them			1
the @entity27 has emphasised it 's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting @entity52 legacy			0
in 2010 the @entity65 said that far too few children were participating in regular competitive sport and that schools be given the freedom to organise more competitive sport			0
ministers want to encourage more competitive sport so it is a vibrant part of the ethos of all schools			0
earlier this month @entity72 helped launch a new £ 150 million grant for school sports facilities			0
the investment comes as the government unveils plans to train teachers to specialise in @entity5 at primary school			1
lord @entity72 said : ' the problem in primary schools is that @entity5 has become too much of a lottery			1
if you have a head teacher – male or female – who understands sport then probably you ’ll have a better chance of getting good provision			0
' but if their experience of sport was not good then that tends to filter through the school			0
it occurred to me that the big gap in provision was in primary schools			0
' however , in a direct contrast the government 's goal of creating more a more competitive atmosphere when it came to physical games , last week a group of @entity2 warned that such sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives			2
safeguarding @entity112 ’s @entity52 legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities , they said in a report published on july 22			0
the @entity118 warned that competitive team sports have a ‘ limited appeal ’ to some children and politicians ’ focus on them can be ‘ counter-productive ’			0
but the committee of mps urged the @entity126 to make clear to schools that there should also be non-competitive activities to increase the wellbeing of all children , and help control obesity .			2
