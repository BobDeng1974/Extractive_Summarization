draped in the blue velvet robes of the @entity1 and with a plumed hat in his hands , at first glance the @entity5 of @entity6 looks every inch a king			1
but in this extraordinary photograph – which has never been seen before - the silver - haired former @entity10 is not posing in state in one of the royal palaces of @entity15			1
instead , he stands squinting in the sun in the back garden of his @entity19 country house , replacing the ceremonial garter around his calf with a blue ribbon			1
it appears in the new issue of @entity36 , along with earlier photographs from the albums , that are being published for the first time			0
filled with intimate shots up to the former king 's death in 1972 , the three albums give a hitherto - unseen glimpse into @entity10 's life as @entity5 , @entity5 and then duke			1
after the duke 's death in 1972 they passed into the possession of his gardener , @entity50 , 90 , who said he had a close working relationship with his royal employer			1
mr @entity50 told the magazine : ' we shared a passion for gardening and nature that cut across the difference in our social backgrounds			0
' as the @entity5 , @entity10 poses with future wife @entity32 and dogs at @entity62 , @entity63 the @entity5 and @entity32 's former country home @entity65 in @entity67 , south west of @entity68 , from 1952 to 1972 an official photographer shoots @entity10 ( left ) posing in his @entity1 robes in @entity71 after his investiture in 1911 at the age of 17 ; the @entity74 pictured @entity5 in garter robes ( right )			1
the caption notes he was depicted as the @entity5 , and the picture is a water colour replica of an artist 's oil painting which hung in the @entity81 measuring 9ft by 6ft mr @entity50 , who is retired and lives near @entity82 , was head gardener at @entity83 , the @entity63 's country retreat southwest of @entity68 , for seven years from 1966			1
he told hello ! that after the duke 's death in 1972 , the duchess gave him the photo albums on her last visit to the house before it was sold - and she generously left him $ 10,000 in her will			1
for him , the volumes initially held sentimental value but as the years passed he began to realise their historical significance			0
the intimate snaps of the @entity5 are in this issue of @entity36 ! magazine the gardener , who worked for the couple with his wife @entity101 , said he was the photographer behind the picture of the older , silver - haired duke posing in the historic garb in front of , what looks like , a farm building			2
mr @entity50 said : ' on one occasion he called me over to take a picture of him in his robes			0
' it was in the garden where he had installed a mini-golf course			0
' interestingly , two parts of the official ceremonial robes are missing : he is not wearing the gold link - chain ' collar ' and he has tied a blue ribbon around his leg rather than the official garter			1
according to @entity36 ! , the first album of the collection passed to mr @entity50 , is labeled @entity125 after the @entity5 's home in @entity63 , @entity62 and seems to track his growing passion for the thin , abrasive @entity129 woman , as she features in almost every shot			2
other snaps capture @entity10 's brief time as king as well as a @entity135 cruise he took with @entity32			1
the photos are just another glimpse into the life one of the most controversial royals who courted scandal with his fast - living set in the 1930s and refused to assume a life of duty when he became king			0
in fact , on becoming king 20 january 193l , he caused a constitutional crisis just months into his reign by seeking to marry @entity32 , an @entity129 socialite who had divorced one man and was trying to divorce another			0
preferring to marry @entity32 , @entity10 abdicated after 326 days , becoming the shortest - reigning monarch in @entity15 history			1
in an address to the nation , he said : ' i have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as i would wish to do without the help and support of the woman i love			0
' after his abdication , his younger brother @entity166 took the throne - and the name @entity170 - while his wife @entity171 became queen , and their eldest daughter @entity171 , first in line for the throne			0
the newly - titled @entity5 married @entity32 in a private ceremony on 3 june , 1937 , at @entity178 near @entity179 , @entity19			1
the new king forbade any members of the royal family to attend the wedding and denied the @entity32 the styling of ' @entity185 ' , which added to the strained relationship between the @entity63 and the rest of the royals			0
@entity10 hoped to settle in @entity15 after a couple of years of exile in @entity19 but his brother @entity170 threatened to cut off his allowance if he returned to @entity15 without an invitation			1
during the war , he was installed as the governor of the @entity196 but afterwards he and the duchess returned to @entity19 where they spent the rest of their lives , becoming international socialites in @entity68 and @entity203			2
while relaxing at @entity204 , the only property the couple would own , @entity10 and @entity32 hosted the biggest stars of the day including @entity208 and @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			2
the @entity5 and @entity32 and the era in which they lived continues to fascinate , with @entity217 's film @entity215 focusing on the couple 's love affair and the @entity221 - winning @entity220 highlighting the relationship between his brother the @entity224 and then @entity170 and his speech therapist			2
the @entity5 and @entity32 , who had been married for 12 years , pictured here in 1949 at @entity228 the @entity1 is the oldest @entity15 order of @entity230 and was founded by @entity231 in 1348			1
it is said to have been founded when at a court ball , a lady lost one of her garters and @entity5 bent down , picked it up and - amid blushes and laughter - tied it around his own leg with the remark : ' @entity245 ' which means , ' shame on him who thinks this evil '			0
the phrase is now the order 's motto			0
the order consists of the monarch and 24 knights and honours men and women ( permitted to join the order in 1987 ) who have served the nation or the sovereign			0
members of the royal family are also permitted to join in addition to the 24 knights and include prince @entity262 , prince @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity224 , @entity10 and @entity265			2
@entity266 is the order 's patron saint and @entity269 , @entity63 is its spiritual home			0
the ceremonial robes have changed and evolved over the years but today the insignia includes the following items : for more information visit and churchill - society - london.org.uk and royal.gov.uk .			2
