but ‘ elf and safety ’ rules mean that rather than just a simple shawl , @entity11 will arrive sporting a crash helmet – in case she falls off the animal			2
the @entity16 in @entity17 , near @entity18 in @entity19 - which is organising the performance - brought in the measure after the donkey ’s owner insisted it must follow council guidelines			1
crash test : organisers of a children 's nativity play have been told the girl playing @entity11 must wear a crash helmet - in case she falls off the donkey ( file picture ) organisers : the open air play is being organised by @entity36 , pictured , in @entity17 , near @entity18 @entity36 youth worker @entity37 , 44 , said : ' we ’ve been advised that any young child riding a horse or donkey needs a hard hat for health and safety purposes			1
' the owner of the donkey has asked us to do this to make sure we ’re in keeping with council guidelines and his insurance policy			1
' we do n’t really mind , we ’ve just got to comply with it , we ’ve got to do everything we can to make sure everyone is happy			0
' our stars will be the children taking part who are aged between six and 16 and the donkey			2
' traditional : the mother of baby jesus is usually portrayed wearing a blue shawl and robes policy : the donkey 's owner has insisted the schoolgirl wears the protective head wear in keeping with council guidelines as she rides through @entity17 town centre ( pictured ) the school girl playing @entity11 has not been chosen yet but she will wear her shawl over the high hat hiding it from view			1
mr @entity37 added : ' @entity72 ’s of children have been on donkeys at the beach so i do n’t think we ’ll have any problem finding a girl who ’s comfortable with it			0
' the donkey in question has been used on the beach before so he ’s very docile			0
' but a donkey is very high of the ground for a small child so it is better to be safe than sorry			0
' we are really excited about it all but a bit nervous			0
' it ’s not everyday you see a donkey walking through the town centre - it ’s a great focal point			0
