by comparison , the @entity33 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches ( 240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm )			1
name : popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the @entity17 - taking its lead from @entity2 's @entity41 smartphone , and the @entity42 size : the tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen , although other dimensions have also been suggested			1
rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick			0
design : the leaked ' sketch ' suggests that the @entity17 will be similar in design to the @entity28 2 , with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges			1
@entity56 : the image differs from the smaller tablet however , because of grilles on the top of the shell , which suggest the device will include stereo speakers , as rumoured			2
launch : sources have suggested different launch times , but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer			0
the @entity71 has a 9.7 - inch display , while the @entity16 is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch screen			1
this would put the @entity75 on par with @entity78 's 12.2 - inch @entity77 , which launched in february			1
last week 's leaked sketch , also reportedly taken by an employee who works at @entity10 seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound			1
the image was released by @entity87 website @entity85 , which has previously leaked details from unannounced smartphones and @entity2 gadgets which proved to be true , citing a @entity10 source			2
the source said that initial testing for the @entity17 was stopped in the summer and @entity2 ’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet			2
the sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the @entity28 2 in design , with rounded corners and the same standby button , rear camera , microphone and volume buttons placement			1
however , seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound , there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell			0
@entity113 magazine @entity111 claimed in december that the @entity17 will also feature a much faster a9 processor and is set to launch between april and june			2
by comparison , the @entity28 2 ( pictured ) is 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches ( 240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm )			1
sources have suggested different launch times for the @entity17 , but the general consensus is that the supersized tablet may make its debut before the summer a leaked photo of a sketch ( pictured ) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a @entity10 factory , where @entity125 are made , also suggests that the rumours of an ‘ @entity17 ’ with a 12.2 inch screen , are true @entity128 and other publications reported that @entity2 was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015 , while a recent report from @entity132 said the @entity134 firm had postponed mass production of the larger ipad from december 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the @entity41 and 6 @entity17 launch			1
these designs showed the gadget as just 7mm thick , but the size of the screen is uncertain , with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches			1
the first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the @entity41 was impacting on @entity125 usage			0
the release of @entity2 ’s @entity151 means there is now only a 2.4 - inch difference between the size of the phablet ’s screen , and the display on its ipad mini			2
analysis has revealed that as phones become larger , more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant			0
the @entity28 2 has a 9.7 - inch display , while the @entity16 is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch @entity165 would put the @entity75 on par with @entity78 's @entity77 , which launched last february ( pictured ) the @entity17 is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger , dwarfing the @entity168 with its 7.9inch screen ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) with a 9.7 inch screen a study by @entity171 - an app that lets users save webpages , videos and other content for reading - recently found that people who upgraded to an @entity41 6 plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before			1
it analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app , and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an @entity41 5 , @entity185 and @entity186 and those who now own an @entity188			0
it also looked at the use of tablets by the same people			0
a survey comparing the before - and - after behaviour of @entity41 and @entity125 users revealed that people with an @entity186 use their phone 55 % of the time , but this increases to 72 % for the @entity41 and 80 % for the @entity41 - both at the detriment of the @entity125 , perhaps explaining why @entity200 is planning a larger one @entity171 also saw users with both an @entity41 and an @entity125 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity203			0
those with the @entity41 ( centre ) opened 33 % more articles and videos inside @entity171 than they did with a @entity186 ( left ) , and those with a @entity208 ( right ) opened 65 % more items than before the @entity41 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through september and into early october , while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent			0
@entity2 's cheaper @entity186 and 5c handsets made up the rest of the sales			0
following last year 's launch , the @entity186 and @entity185 accounted for 84 per cent of total @entity41 sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular			2
the skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the @entity41 are lower because @entity2 is struggling to complete orders			0
recent figures from @entity171 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity171 users are opting for an @entity41 as opposed to a 6 @entity17			2
‘ the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more time you ’ll spend reading and watching on it , ’ explained the researchers in a blog post			0

’ it discovered that users who upgraded to an @entity41 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time , up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen			0
@entity171 also saw that users with both an @entity41 and an @entity125 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity203			0
but , a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and @entity171 noticed that people with an @entity41 read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model			0
recent figures from @entity171 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity171 users are opting for an @entity41 as opposed to a 6 @entity17			2
