by @entity0 life - sized figures sketched into red rock cliffs in @entity6 were drawn 1,000 years more recently than thought , a team of @entity3 scientists has claimed			1
the team used modern luminescence dating techniques to analyze when the art went up in what is known as the ' @entity12 ' in southeastern @entity13 's @entity12			1
the researchers believe the figures were created 1,000 to 2,000 years ago instead of the previously thought 2,000 to 4,000 years ago			1

luminescence dating techniques have been around for decades , but the method for the study is a newer form and was used with the help of scientists from @entity26 , @entity19 said			1
they homed in on a date estimate by studying how sunlight bleached away stored signals of radiation on the exposed rocks , he said			2
@entity19 and @entity32 are hopeful they can study other rock art to determine more precise date estimates , saying they believe the technique is widely applicable			2
the study suggests the drawings may been done as man transitioned to a culture of farming and away from hunting and gathering , said @entity45 , one of the foremost experts on rock art in @entity48			2
the research becomes important in better understanding art known as @entity52 - style paintings , which are usually shrouded in mystery , said @entity45 , who was not involved in the study			0
because of the more recent time stamp , the art was likely created during a time of great transition , when new ideologies , religions and customs were emerging , said @entity32 , a @entity3 anthropology professor , who worked with university geology professor @entity19 on the study			2
' it puts in a very momentous time , ' @entity32 said			0
they published a paper of their findings this month in the online @entity69 of the @entity70			0
determining the date of rock art is very difficult , and there has traditionally been very little interest from scientists in tackling the projects , said @entity77 , who has studied rock art for 35 years and written 17 books			2
' we tend to think of art and science as being polar opposites			0
the result is that artists do n't talk about science much , and scientists do n't talk about art much , ' @entity45 said			0
' i 'm very happy they did this			0

the seeds of the study were planted about eight years ago when a man brought a piece of sandstone from the area to @entity19			1
the retired scientist and rock - art enthusiast wanted to find out if it were possible to assess the date of a drawing by looking at the composition or color of the rocks			0
the question piqued the interest of @entity19 , who specializes in the history of rivers and has written articles on the age of the @entity114			0

after going to see the @entity12 figures up close , @entity19 was determined to test the man 's theory			1
' i realized , we can actually figure out the date of this , ' @entity19 said			0
' it was just kind of luck that a rock - art enthusiast knocked on my door			0

sketches found in ' @entity12 ' in southeastern @entity13 's @entity12 .
the researchers now believe the figures were created 1,000 to 2,000 years ago instead of the previously thought 2,000 to 4,000 years ago
