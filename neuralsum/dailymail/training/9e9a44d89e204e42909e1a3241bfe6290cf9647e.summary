a picture taken by the street - level imaging site shows a mystery figure lurking on the family 's driveway at about the time the white @entity12 holiday vehicle vanished			1

in the frame : @entity5 image captures suspicious figure lurking on driveway in @entity28 , @entity29 hopeful : @entity15 and @entity13 and their children @entity17 and @entity33 are hoping this @entity5 image will lead to a conviction in the unsolved theft of their caravan they immediately informed police probing the theft in @entity28 , @entity29 , but much to their frustration @entity5 initially refused a request to un-blur the number plate on the suspect 's 4x4 - making it far harder to trace him			1
the internet giant finally released the unblurred images in the beginning of 2011 - but by then the car had been sold on			1
this week officers finally arrested a man at @entity53 motorway services , on the @entity54 outside @entity55 , using information gleaned from the @entity5 image			1
a spokesperson for @entity59 said : ' a man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and he has since been released on police bail			1
' refused : @entity5 stalled on a request to un-blur a picture taken by a street - mapping car that police hoped would identify the culprit behind the theft of a caravan like the one pictured , right the theft happened in june 2009 after mr @entity13 left the family home for just one hour			1
he said : ' it was alarmed , was wheelclamped and was positioned so that a number of people would have had to move it to get it off the drive - i thought it was secure			0
' the @entity13 left the investigation in the hands of police but thought they would never hear about the stolen caravan again			0
then , while @entity17 , now 14 , was searching the internet with friends at school and locating their houses on @entity5 , he spotted the alleged thief			2
@entity13 said : ' @entity17 came home and told us what he 'd seen			0
we all had a look and you could tell it must have been the day that the theft happened - we had never seen that man or his car before			0
' we passed the image on to the police who have since been looking for the man pictured			2
' blurred out : number plates on mystery man 's 4x4 were fuzzed out in original @entity5 images @entity5 's stance baffled the family and left police struggling for leads as the thief left behind few clues aside from the discarded wheel clamps that had been used to secure the caravan			1
pc @entity114 , who was investigating the theft at the time , said : ' it was an amazing coincidence that the @entity119 car was passing at that time			0
' i ’ve made extensive inquiries since the image was discovered but because the registration plate of the 4x4 is blanked out we have been unable to trace the man through his car			2
' a @entity5 spokesman said : ' it ’s very important to @entity5 and our users that we only provide information if valid process is followed , as laid down by governments in law			0
' we have a team specifically trained to evaluate and respond to requests when they are received , and we will of course co-operate with police requests as long as they are legally valid and follow the correct processes			0
' the @entity142 said it could not comment on individual cases but a spokeswoman added that the @entity145 did not prohibit a company passing on information if it was related to the investigation of a crime			0
the picture was taken by one of @entity5 ’s specially adapted cars that travel the world taking pictures			2
