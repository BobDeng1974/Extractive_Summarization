by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 06:13 est , 11 october 2012 terror suspect @entity2 is ' scraping the barrel ' in an appeal against deportation which ' bears all the hallmarks of a last - ditch argument ' , a tribunal was told today			1
the radical cleric , described by a judge as @entity13 's right - hand man in @entity14 , would receive a fair trial in @entity16 if deported , lawyers for home secretary @entity9 said			1
the government is satisfied that evidence gained through torture would not be used against @entity20 in any trial over terror charges , @entity23 , for the home secretary , said			2
@entity20 , described by a judge as @entity13 ’s right - hand man in @entity14 , is facing a retrial on terror charges			2
uncertain future : @entity2 is facing a retrial on terror charges after home secretary @entity9 was given assurances by @entity16 that no evidence gained through torture would be used against him discussing the case as the hearing began , mr @entity31 , president of the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , said : ' the evidence seems extremely thin			1
' he made the comment as he began a ' factual review ' of the 51 - year - old radical cleric 's case			1
@entity2 , who is also called @entity40 , has challenged and ultimately thwarted every attempt by the government over the last decade to put him on a plane and is fighting against deportation at the immigration tribunal appeal in central @entity46			1
mr @entity47 said statements from @entity20 's former co-defendants - @entity50 and @entity51 - which were alleged to have been obtained by torture could no longer be used by the @entity16 courts			1
review : mr @entity31 , president of the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , said : ' the evidence seems extremely thin ' he also rejected suggestions by @entity20 's legal team that the pair would suffer ill - treatment or otherwise be unduly pressured if called to give evidence under oath in any retrial			1
he said : ' it is submitted that this assertion of future ill - treatment of the former co-defendants bears all the hallmarks of a last - ditch argument			1
' mr @entity47 also rejected a new claim by @entity20 's lawyers that the radical cleric would be taken into administrative detention if returned to @entity16			1
' this contention simply illustrates the extent to which the appellant is scraping the barrel in this appeal , ' mr @entity47 said			0
he went on : ' in reality , the position is clear : as a matter of @entity16 law , the previous statements made by @entity50 and @entity51 will not form part of the evidence which is considered by the court in the retrial of the appellant			0
' the two men will be called to give fresh evidence , and if they do so , will be able to give their evidence freely and without fear of reprisal			0
' in a written skeleton argument handed to the court , mr @entity47 said the home secretary ' will highlight the new information and assurances which she has received ' from @entity16			2
@entity96 , 66 , the former @entity97 ambassador to @entity98 who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances , will give evidence to the appeal , in front of @entity32 president mr @entity31 , tomorrow			1
he will describe how the @entity16 authorities ' have given all possible assistance in terms of establishing in more detail precisely what procedures would be followed in the appellant 's retrial ' , mr @entity47 said			2
however , @entity111 , representing @entity20 , said : ' i think there are some serious issues with the allegations made against mr @entity40			2
' he was referring to terror charges which @entity2 was convicted of in @entity16 in his absence and for which he faces a retrial			0
mr @entity111 also insisted @entity20 ’s lawyers ’ aim was not simply to delay proceedings further by launching yet more appeals			0
' that was not necessarily our aim , two more appeals and 10 more years , ' he said			0
involved : @entity20 is facing a retrial on terror charges after home secretary @entity9 ( pictured ) was given assurances by @entity16 that no evidence gained through torture would be used against him but even if @entity20 loses when the decision is handed down next month , it could still be many months before the government can send him to @entity16 as he could eventually appeal again to @entity14 ’s human rights judges			1
@entity2 , who is in custody , did not attend today ’s hearing			0
repeated failed attempts by @entity97 governments over the last 10 years to deport @entity20 have cost nearly £ 1m in legal fees , @entity135 figures show			1
expensive : repeated failed attempts by @entity97 governments over the last 10 years to deport @entity20 have cost nearly £ 1m in legal fees no figures have been given for how much @entity20 has received in legal aid and some estimates put the cost of keeping @entity20 in the @entity97 , either in a high - security jail or closely monitored under strict conditions in the community , along with the legal costs of the fight to deport him , at more than £ 3m			1
at the @entity156 this summer , @entity155 , representing @entity20 , said the cleric has now been in detention for seven years - ' the longest period of administrative detention as far as we know in modern @entity163 history '			2
he was last refused bail over the @entity165 , when police and security services were fully stretched , with judges also ruling that the risk of him absconding in the run - up to today ’s hearing justified his continued detention			0
lord @entity174 and mr @entity175 said they did not agree with mr @entity178 ’s ' gloomy prognosis that another year or more of litigation is to be expected after the fortnight ’s hearing in @entity32 '			0
@entity20 could appeal against the @entity32 ruling , the judges said , but any appeal ' would have to be on points of law ' and it was not ' an inevitability ' that the @entity189 in @entity190 would want to hear the case again			0
@entity2 , who is said to have wide and high - level support among extremists , was convicted in his absence in @entity16 of involvement with terror attacks in 1998 and faces a retrial in his home country			0
he also featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of one of the september 11 bombers			0
@entity14 ’s human rights judges ruled in january that @entity20 could only be deported if evidence gained through torture would not be used against him in his trial			2
the appeal will test whether mrs may has secured assurances from @entity16 to ensure a fair trial and whether deportation proceedings can continue , rather than only the strength of the case against him			1
@entity216 , the former @entity97 ambassador to @entity98 who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances , will give evidence tomorrow			0
he is expected to be followed by a @entity16 lawyer who advises the @entity220 in @entity221 .			0

@entity223 told @entity20 appeal against deportation ' bears all the hallmarks of a last - ditch argument '
mr @entity31 has begun a ' factual review ' of whether the 51 - year - old radical cleric would get a fair trial if deported to @entity16
@entity20 has thwarted every attempt by the government over the last decade to put him on a plane
deportation saga has cost @entity135 nearly £ 1m in legal fees
