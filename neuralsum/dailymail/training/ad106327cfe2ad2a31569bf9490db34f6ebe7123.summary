humiliated : @entity0 makes the announcement that his plans to reform the @entity3 have been killed off - and that he will now block constituency boundary change proposals @entity0 plunged the @entity5 into brutal bloodletting last night after delivering a crushing blow to @entity9 hopes of a majority at the next election			1
the deputy prime minister announced he was abandoning his pet plans for @entity3 reform after opposition from conservative backbenchers			0
and in a tit - for - tat move branded a ‘ treachery ’ by senior @entity19 , mr @entity0 said the @entity20 would now vote against @entity9 plans to redraw constituency boundaries which are expected to help the @entity9 gain 20 seats at the next election			1
senior @entity20 admitted that an angry mr @entity0 wanted to deliver a ‘ punch ’ to his @entity5 partners			1
the @entity20 leader accused the @entity19 of breaking the @entity5 ‘ contract ’ after @entity9 @entity26 rebelled over the @entity3			1
but @entity19 pointed out that it was the @entity29 referendum on electoral reform – not a shake - up of the @entity3 – which was linked to the boundary changes in the @entity33			1
on @entity34 it bound them only to set up a committee to suggest changes , which they did			2
mr @entity0 was branded a ‘ child ’ and a ‘ hypocrite ’ by senior @entity19 who vowed to wreak their revenge on the @entity20			1
one senior minister privately said the prime minister should kick @entity20 ministers out of the @entity5 and run a minority government if they fail to back the boundary changes			1
a cabinet minister said : ‘ everyone knows we gave the @entity20 the av referendum for boundaries			2
at the earliest opportunity we must revenge @entity0 ’s betrayal			2
’ and another senior @entity9 said mr @entity0 ‘ has effectively called time on the @entity5 ’ and urged mr @entity54 to ‘ walk away ’			1
he said : ‘ you simply can not have a situation where @entity59 ministers do n’t vote for government policy			0
that ’s very different from backbenchers , who can vote how they like			0
’ battle : @entity54 looks set to drop @entity3 reforms next week but the @entity20 look like to retaliate the senior figure said mr @entity54 should move to a ‘ confidence and supply ’ arrangement where the @entity20 would back the government on budget measures and votes of confidence but could vote as they wished on other matters			1
many @entity19 fear that without boundary changes they have little prospect of winning a majority in 2015 because the current constituencies are stacked in @entity80 ’s favour			1
the developments also call into question mr @entity54 ’s authority over his own party			2
yesterday ’s move means that @entity20 ministers will be in the extraordinary position of voting against their own @entity59 ’s policy when the boundary changes come before the @entity88 next year			1
if mr @entity54 lets that stand , it could lead to a catastrophic breakdown of @entity59 discipline , fuelling other rebellions			0
and in another bizarre twist , mr @entity0 made clear that he would continue to stuff the @entity3 with new members even though his main complaint is that there are too many peers			1
mr @entity0 even came under fire from his own side			1
@entity101 said mr @entity0 ’s @entity3 reforms were ‘ ill - thought - out ’ and the @entity20 had to accept the plans did not have enough support in the @entity88			1
at a @entity106 briefing , mr @entity0 confirmed he was dropping his @entity107 , after being informed by mr @entity54 that an ‘ insufficient number ’ of conservative mps was prepared to back it			1
@entity54 , pictured with @entity112 president @entity111 at @entity113 today , is said to have told mr @entity0 that he was flogging a dead horse in trying to get the reform through mr @entity0 said he was acting ‘ reluctantly ’ after the prime minister made clear he was unable to reverse the revolt by 91 @entity9 backbenchers last month which forced the government to abandon the crucial timetable motion limiting commons debate on the @entity123			1
‘ the @entity9 is not honouring the commitment to @entity34 and , as a result , part of our contract has now been broken , ’ he said			1
‘ clearly i can not permit a situation where @entity9 rebels can pick and choose the parts of the contract they like , while @entity20 mps are bound to the entire agreement			1
‘ @entity5 works on mutual respect ; it is a reciprocal arrangement , a two - way street			2
so i have told the prime minister that when , in due course , @entity140 votes on boundary changes for the 2015 election i will be instructing my party to oppose them			1
’ the deputy prime minister dressed up his announcement as principle			0
but a senior @entity20 figure made clear that his real motivation was to get his own back for a series of @entity5 setbacks , saying : ‘ sometimes you have to deliver a punch			1
’ @entity113 said mr @entity54 had known for several weeks what was coming and was calm about the developments when mr @entity0 confirmed he was pulling the plug in a phone call on monday morning			1
but no 10 also made clear that the @entity19 will push the boundary changes to a vote since that will force the @entity20 to publicly vote against a reduction in the number of mps which was in their election manifesto			1
the government ’s now - defunct proposals would have reduced the number of mps from 650 to 600			0
as well as cutting the number of constituencies , those remaining would have more equal populations than at present			0
in @entity140 now there are big differences in the number of voters between one constituency and another			0
this is the result of some city populations declining and rural ones growing			0
this social shift has not been reflected in the size of constituencies and many are badly imbalanced			0
for example , @entity186 has a population of 61,000 while @entity189 has 90,000			0
because @entity80 ’s heartlands are in urban areas and the @entity19 ’ safest seats are in the countryside , differences in voter numbers from constituency to constituency have the effect , over time , of favouring @entity80			1
the current position is that it takes more @entity9 votes to win a general election than @entity80 ones			2
it is for this reason that the @entity9 included a commitment in their 2010 manifesto to reduce the number of @entity26 and equalise voter numbers			2
the @entity20 also wanted to cut the number of @entity26			2
indeed , proposals from the independent @entity210 would have redrawn the majority of existing constituencies			0
in some cases , this would have had a major impact and altered dramatically the composition of constituencies			0
for example , several seats would have seen less than 50 per cent of their voters transferred to the proposed new constituency			0
the constituencies of mps such as @entity80 ’s @entity225 and @entity226 as well as the @entity19 ’ @entity222 would have been affected in this way			2
it is not surprising , therefore , that many mps whose constituencies were set to be radically redrawn , including a number of conservatives , will be relieved that @entity0 has stopped the reform			0
less pleased , though , will be @entity54 and @entity9 strategists who were expecting the review to improve their chances of winning the next election outright			0
expert calculations say 600 constituencies with broadly more equal voter numbers would reduce the number of @entity80 seats by around 28 , the @entity20 ’ total by 11 and the @entity9 by only about seven			1
thus , the @entity19 would be significantly better off in relation to @entity80 – and more likely to win an election			0
@entity0 ’s cynical retaliation will have two effects			2
first , it makes it likely that the @entity20 will lose slightly fewer seats at the next election than currently appears inevitable			0
second , it makes it less easy for the @entity9 to win an outright victory			0
the way things now stand , it is significantly more likely that @entity80 ’s @entity257 , possibly with @entity0 ’s support , will win the next election – be it in 2014 or 2015			0
@entity260 is a government expert at the @entity261 what are the boundary changes ? the @entity5 has pledged to cut the number of seats for mps in the @entity267 from 650 to 600 , arguing this will save around £ 12million a year , and will be fairer			2
under the change , the vast majority of parliamentary seats would contain the same number of eligible voters within a margin of 5 per cent			0
it is controversial because it currently takes far more votes to elect a @entity9 mp in a rural seat than an urban @entity80 member			2
the @entity20 agreed to support the reforms in return for a referendum on the introduction of the alternative vote system			2
this was held in 2011 and was roundly rejected by voters			0
how will the parties be affected ? @entity80 is likely to sustain the biggest losses , but proportionately the @entity20 would be hit hardest			0
some experts believe the reforms will hand the @entity19 an extra 20 seats at the next general election and put several senior @entity20 at risk			1
what has this to do with @entity34 ? @entity20 regard @entity34 and @entity210 changes as a package , although they are not explicitly linked in the @entity5 deal			1
the party has threatened to vote down the boundary changes if @entity3 reforms are dumped			0
@entity303 , a @entity20 mp , has warned of a ‘ chain reaction ’ which would threaten the rest of the @entity5 ’s programme			1
what happens next ? @entity54 is pressing ahead with the changes			0
the blueprint will have to be approved in a @entity88 vote as early as the end of 2013 to be in place for the next general election in 2015			0
what will @entity0 do ? he may use the threat of voting down the package to try to extract policy commitments to shore up his grassroots support			0
what do the @entity19 think ? furious backbenchers say they fulfilled their side of the bargain by agreeing to the @entity29 poll			0
they also mutter that any @entity20 backsliding could finish the @entity5			1
video : @entity0 confirms @entity327 's reform is axed ...			2

in return the @entity20 leader says his party will block @entity9 constituency boundary change plans
' @entity19 have not honoured their commitment to @entity34 or @entity5 contract , ' he said
' when parliament votes on boundary changes i will be instructing my party to oppose them , ' he added
some @entity19 say mr @entity0 's retaliation could sink the *coalition*
