@entity0 had called police because he was worried his father would try to drive			2
his brother was found hiding under the bed			0
the night of the murders , neighbors reported hearing a single gunshot about 7:30 p.m. , which seems to corroborate @entity0 's story about his father firing the gun outside of the home			2
