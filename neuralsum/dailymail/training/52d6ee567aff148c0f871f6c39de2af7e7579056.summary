@entity0 and @entity1 have split for the fourth time and @entity0 is reputedly heartbroken			1
but i still think it 's @entity1 who will hurt more			1
do n't believe the romance novels : women are n't the love slaves			1
psychologists have discovered that , while men still fall in love less often than women , when they fall , they fall harder , quicker – and out of love slower			1
here 's six reasons why : women have better coping strategies a typical female reaction to a painful break - up is to hotfoot it to her best friend 's house and spend the next three weeks ( or three months ) talking about her ex and her feelings to anyone that will listen			1
women are more emotionally expressive and healthily in touch with their soft underbellies			1
by letting out our grief and sadness , we get the pain out of our systems and are able to move on quickly			1
men , @entity38 love them , bottle things up			1
his reaction to a split with a treasured girlfriend is to mask the pain			1
@entity0 appeared to be heartbroken as she emerged for the first time since the split yesterday but @entity45 insists that her ex will be suffering the most he 'll either a ) not think about it and throw himself into work in an attempt to reaffirm his own worth ; or b ) not think about it and start sleeping around for the same reasons ; or c ) not think about it , get drunk and stay out until 3 am , running himself into the ground			1
in other words , he 'll do just about anything rather than confront the pain and deal with it			2
sleeping around makes things worse ironically , the more he 's seen about town with replacement bimbettes on his arm , the more he 's probably hurting			1
it does n't mean he does n't care – in fact , quite the opposite			2
when people lose someone they love , they 're overcome by feelings of worthlessness			2
women cope by getting their act together , proving their worth that way			2
for some men , it 's simply easier to sleep around : ' if i can pull the chicky - babes , i must be okay			1
' @entity45 says that unlike @entity1 , @entity0 will probably find it easier to talk to her friends and get her feelings off her chest rather than bottle things up this is also why men become self - abusive			1
they 're feeling unloved and unworthy , so treat themselves accordingly , surviving on diets of beer and curry			2
what he really should be doing is quite the opposite - looking after himself more and replacing the love lost with another			2
he ca n't talk to his friends the same way women do theirs while female relationships are based on talking , especially about our feelings , men 's relationships are based on doing : things like playing sport , joking around , having a beer			1
while some men do have substantial conversations with their friends , many do n't			1
talking about their pain or their problems just is n't acceptable : they feel stupid , weak and pathetic if they broach personal topics			2
as a result , men are more emotionally independent than women and are used to being self - reliant			1
fabulous - until you hit a rough spot			2
the female support system is infinitely more helpful at a time like this			2
@entity45 says that sleeping around after a break up is a sign that he 's struggling to cope even if his friends are concerned about him , they often would n't have a clue what to say to fix it			2
this is where his platonic girlfriends could well be his saving grace			0
it 's okay to get advice from a female			0
' they even seem to like doing that sort of stuff ! ' , one male friend told me in astonishment			0
he did n't see it coming women see the writing on the wall when it 's in tiny , tiny letters			0
men often would n't notice if she wrote , ' you 're about to be dumped , ' on the bathroom mirror			1
it 's the right - brain , left - brain thing			0
the left side of our brain is the ' thinking ' part ( logic and facts ) ; the right side works with ' feelings ' ( emotion , intuition , expression )			0
usually men are more left - brain dominated and women right - brain			1
so he 's not as in tune with the touchy - feely side that would warn him she was about to leave			0
@entity45 says that women are the lucky ones after a split as their looks tend to improve he loses more mutual friends while women lean heavily on good friends after a break , men often do quite the opposite			1
they tend to drop ' couple ' friends in favour of single males who 'll go out and party with them			0
sometimes he 'll avoid good friends of his ex because it 's too painful to hear how well she 's faring without him			0
the end result : he 's lonely and dwells on the past			0
women look better after a split , men often look worse women tend to lose weight initially , then do a complete image overhaul when feeling human again as a ' starting over ' gesture			1
feeling great and looking fabulous , they 're more confident and their social life blooms			0
men tend to mope about depressed			1
says @entity203 , a friend of mine , ' my girlfriend transformed herself after i left			0
it was quite remarkable : she 'd gone from a shy wallflower to this incredibly confident girl who everyone wanted at their party			0
' no - one asked me anywhere – probably because when they did , i stood in a corner and felt sorry for myself or behaved like a total moron by getting too drunk			0
' he does n't clear out the closet for next time a crucial part of getting over someone is getting rid of – or at least putting away – remnants of the relationship			0
it 's all part of letting go			0
if her old hairbrush is still in the bathroom , he may get stuck and never let go			0
if his next girlfriend finds herself walking into a shrine of his ex , she will not be happy			0
he might defend the pictures on the wall by saying she 's a friend , but it 's obvious to her that he 's looking for a new relationship to mask the pain of the last one			0
often , it 's only when he 's met someone new , someone he can trust , that he finally does deal with all the pain the break - up caused			0
he has to let go of the hurt at some point - and more often than not , it 's the next girlfriend who cops it			0
there wo n't be a next girlfriend , if there 's obvious evidence he 's still mourning the first and the problem never gets solved ! for more of @entity45 's advice on dealing with a breakup , read hot relationships : how to have one available here .			0
