the last two weeks have showcased all that is best about @entity2			1
he has driven supremely well , gaining the congratulations of the man he hopes to emulate as a triple world champion , sir @entity6			1
but seeing the two men on the podium – one as the winner of the @entity10 , the other conducting the post-race interviews – was a reminder of what differentiates them as individuals as well as what binds them together as exceptional grand prix drivers			1
@entity2 could do considerably worse than learn a few things from and about sir @entity6			1
@entity2 is interviewed by three - time world champion sir @entity6 after the @entity19 @entity10 @entity2 crosses the line in @entity19 ahead of @entity21 to claim his third win from four races this term @entity2 probably will not want to hear it , judging by how he has previously dismissed @entity6 ’s opinions , honestly given when sought as a pundit who speaks with all the authority of the most successful @entity30 driver in history			1
@entity2 said grouchily , that he was disappointed ex-drivers were not being more supportive , as if blind adoration was his birthright			1
here are just a few reasons why @entity2 should listen to sir @entity6			1
he drove in an era when a driver racing for five years had a two in three chance of dying			2
he changed that through tireless campaigning for safety measures to save not only drivers but spectators from preventable injuries			2
and then there is his charitable work for a children ’s club in the east end of @entity49 , for mechanics fallen on hard times , and dyslexia societies			2
there is also his considerable contribution to @entity56 industry over more than 40 years			2
a perfectionist , he will quietly remove a hair of your lapel as he speaks to you			2
he is not without ego , but conducts himself with decorum			2
the 30 - year - old @entity63 celebrates his second straight win in @entity19 to extend his lead in the championship @entity2 finished ahead of @entity21 ( centre ) and @entity69 team - mate @entity68 in the @entity70 i wish @entity2 could show a little bit humility towards the past			1
that he could see that @entity30 history did not start with @entity75			0
if he could start to appreciate some of the wider picture he might find himself more widely liked			0
he might not spray champagne into the face of a girl on the podium as he did in @entity81 last week – hardly a hanging offence but , given that she could not respond , an inconsiderate act and an ungallant one			1
he might not gracelessly sulk , as he did most memorably at @entity84 last year to @entity6 ’s stated chagrin , when he is beaten			1
he might not be as surly as he can be at press conferences			0
he might not turn up rudely late to engineering meetings			0
he might not shun advice freely given by greats of his sport who speak candidly and without malice			0
@entity92 snaps up @entity94 veteran @entity96 is hiring a public relations veteran to help promote @entity30 , i can reveal			0
@entity98 , a former journalist with the @entity99 , is expected to return to the job he held a decade ago			0
since then @entity98 ’s groaning cv includes spells as publisher of the satirical paddock newspaper @entity105 , director of communications at the @entity107 and , briefly , spokesman for the @entity110 division of the @entity111			0
the @entity107 under the ultra-shy @entity112 gave the cultured @entity98 little freedom to work			0
it remains to be seen how @entity96 , a one - man quotes machine , will deploy @entity98			0
@entity116 supremo @entity96 is pictured speaking to @entity68 ahead of sunday 's @entity10 @entity117 charged with ' false ' claims the usual , tedious political narrative accompanied the @entity10			1
a starring role is always given to @entity117			0
he is blithely hailed in many sections of the media as a human rights campaigner			0
the complaint is that he has been wrongly arrested by the @entity19 authorities , who are suppressing freedom of speech			1
but it is worth recording that he has been charged with falsely ( according to the government ) accusing coalition forces in @entity132 – including @entity19 – of promoting ethnic cleansing by targeting women , children and religious structures			1
he passed off these claims with photographs that were not from @entity132 at all , but of dead children in @entity141 and a dead baby in @entity143 , both from last year			0
i say this to show that neither side in this complex country – not least the feted @entity117 , an unlawful activist , who is trying to overthrow the government – has a monopoly on morality .			0

@entity2 roared to **victory** in @entity19 to extend his lead in title race
it marked the world champion 's third **victory** from four races this *season*
he was interviewed on the podium by the *legendary* sir @entity6
and @entity2 could do worse than learn a few things from the great @entity165
