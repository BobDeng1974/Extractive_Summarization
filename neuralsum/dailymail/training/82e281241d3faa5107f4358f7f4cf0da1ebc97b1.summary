by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , otherwise known as @entity2 , paid off another slice of his £ 3million transfer fee as he fired @entity5 to victory at the @entity7 on tuesday night			1
it was the @entity10 striker ’s third goal in four games in all competitions since moving to @entity13 from @entity14 this summer , and gave @entity16 ’s side a much - needed lift following saturday ’s last - minute defeat at @entity19			1
it looked as though @entity5 would have to settle for a point after captain @entity22 converted a penalty at the end of the first half to cancel out a spot - kick from @entity27 in the 27th minute			1
