the @entity1 were colonised earlier than believed and it was n't by the @entity2 , a study said			0
' @entity2 ' are pictured at a @entity4 festival the @entity1 were colonised much earlier than previously believed , and it was n’t by the @entity2 , a study has found			0
new archaeological evidence places human colonisation in the 4th to 6th centuries @entity8 , at least 300 to 500 years earlier than when the @entity10 colonists arrived on the remote islands			1
historians have said that the identity of the first settlers remains unknown , but they could have been hermit monks from @entity15 or @entity16			1
the research challenges the nature , scale and timing of human settlement of the wider @entity23 region and has implications for the colonisation of similar island groups across the world			0
it has long been thought that @entity2 were the first settlers in the 9th century on the windy islands , which are situated between the @entity23 and @entity31			2
archaeologists at @entity33 studied a site at @entity35 on the island of @entity37 and found an extensive windblown sand deposit containing patches of burnt peat ash from human activity , dating human settlement to @entity44 times			2
these ash spreads contained barley grains that were burnt in domestic hearths and were then spread by humans onto the windblown sand surface between the 4th and 6th centuries and between the 6th and 8th centuries , a common practice identified in the @entity23 during this period to control wind erosion			0
the discovery signifies that the settlers were established on the islands and must have grown and processed barley and used peat to cook			0
it has long been thought that @entity2 were the first settlers in the 9th century on the windy islands , which are situated between the @entity23 and @entity31			0

the research , directed by dr @entity64 from @entity33 and @entity65 from the @entity66 of the @entity1 , is published in the @entity67			0
lead author dr @entity64 said : ' there is now firm archaeological evidence for the human colonisation of the @entity1 by people some 300 to 500 years before the large scale @entity74 colonisation of the 9th century @entity8 , although we do n’t yet know who these people were or where they came from			1
' the majority of archaeological evidence for this early colonisation is likely to have been destroyed by the major @entity74 invasion , explaining the lack of proof found in the @entity1 for the earlier settlement			1
' this also raises questions about the timing of human activity on other islands systems where similarly evidence may have been destroyed			2
' dr @entity64 told @entity93 the first settlers on the islands could have been @entity96 hermit monks called ' anchorites ' from @entity16 or @entity15			1
the theory is supported @entity16 monk @entity98 , who wrote in the year 825 that hermit monks from @entity16 were livng on islands far north of @entity102 before the @entity2 , although he did not explicitly name the @entity1			1
dr @entity64 from @entity33 said the first settlers on the islands could have been @entity96 hermit monks from @entity16 or @entity15			1
he thinks the settlers would probably have lived in the sheltered bays ( unlike the hilly cliffs pictured ) in the same locations where the @entity2 built their longhouses dr @entity64 said the settlers would probably have lived in the sheltered bays found on the islands in the same locations where the @entity2 built their longhouses			0
consequently little evidence of the earlier settlers is likely to be found , but the archaeologists believe the anonymous people living in the bleak location in the 4th to 6th centuries @entity8 must have been able to build boats and navigate the surrounding seas			2
the study said the @entity1 were the first stepping stone beyond @entity4 for the dispersal of @entity124 people across the @entity23 that culminated on the shores of continental @entity127 in the 11th century @entity8 , about 500 years before @entity128 made his famous voyage			1
co-author , mr @entity131 from the @entity66 of the @entity1 , said : ' although we do n’t know who the people were that settled here and where they came from , it is clear that they did prepare peat for use , by cutting , drying and burning it which indicates they must have stayed here for some time			0
' we now have to digest these dates of this early evidence in relation to other sources and consider whether there may be other similar sites , elsewhere on the islands , which may be able to provide us with further structural archaeological evidence			1

new evidence places human colonisation of islands around *5th* century @entity8 - between 300 to 500 years earlier than when norse colonists arrived
archaeologist from the @entity33 said the first settlers are unknown but could have been hermit monks from @entity15 or @entity16
the majority of archaeological evidence for this early colonisation is likely to have been destroyed by the major @entity74 invasion
