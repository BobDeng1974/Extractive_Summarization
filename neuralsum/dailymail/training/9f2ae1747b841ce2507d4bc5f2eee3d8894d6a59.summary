the government has been hit by a new data security scandal after a secret file on the fatal shooting of @entity4 by police went missing			1
a computer disk containing details of the case which triggered @entity10 's worst riots in a generation is thought to have been lost in the post by the @entity13			1
@entity14 confirmed it was looking into the case – and had taken action over the potential security implications			1
none of the officers has been identified since @entity28 died four years ago and the @entity32 would not confirm or deny if their names were on the disk			1
jurors at the inquest into @entity28 's death – who cleared police of killing him unlawfully – were also granted anonymity , and it is possible their details were also on the disk			1
justice secretary @entity44 has ordered an investigation to try to find out how the disk vanished – and to find it			2
@entity10 's data watchdog , the information commissioner , is also examining the case			1
on august 4 , 2011 , @entity28 was in a minicab travelling through @entity52 when the vehicle was stopped by police			1
the 29 - year - old was in the feared @entity58 gang and although he only had relatively minor convictions for cannabis possession and handling stolen goods , police feared he was out to avenge the death of a cousin , and so put him under surveillance			0
shot dead : @entity4 was in a minicab travelling through @entity52 when the vehicle was stopped by police @entity28 is said to have brandished a firearm at officers before running off and was shot twice , dying from a gunshot wound to the chest			1
a pistol was found wrapped in a sock up to 20ft from his body , over a fence			0
two days later , relatives of @entity28 , accompanied by local residents , marched on @entity58 's police station , demanding answers about the killing			1
after a confrontation with riot officers , cars and buses were torched			0
looting then began as police stood back and over the next two days the disorder spread across the country , leading to five deaths and £ 200million of damage			0
more than 1,400 rioters were later jailed			0
investigations into the case were also dogged by controversy			2
the @entity95 admitted it had given false information to journalists in the wake of the killing , while @entity14 apologised for not telling @entity28 's family about his death straight away			1
police involved in the shooting refused to be questioned by the @entity95 , giving written statements instead , while an inquest was delayed			2
when it finally began in september 2013 , firearms officers were allowed to give their evidence anonymously but were repeatedly challenged about their version of the events			0
the policeman who fired the fatal shots – identified only as @entity113 – told how he and his colleagues surrounded @entity28 with their guns , and said that he had ' an honest belief he was going to shoot me '			1
he said it was ' complete rubbish ' to say @entity28 was not armed when he was shot			1
another officer – called @entity121 in the hearings – said it was ' highly offensive ' to claim that police had planted a gun at the scene			0
the inquest jury returned a verdict of lawful killing on january 8 last year , sparking fresh fury from campaigners			0
in a later report , coroner @entity132 said the police had ' created a perception of collusion ' by meeting to discuss their statements after the killing			0
the scene of the shooting in @entity52 in august 2011			2
investigations into the case were dogged by controversy in october , @entity28 's family lost an appeal against the inquest verdict , but at least one @entity32 officer – codenamed @entity147 – is facing disciplinary action , for not stopping @entity28 from obtaining a gun from a supplier			1
the precise circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the disk have not been revealed but a @entity32 spokesman said : ' we have carried out a full risk assessment on the material that we have been informed was on the disk , and have taken the necessary steps			2
due to the nature of the material , we are not prepared to discuss what those steps entail			0
' the @entity32 has offered its full support in attempting to locate the disk			2
' the @entity165 said : ' we are aware of the case and we are making enquiries			2
' it could be one of the most serious @entity170 data losses since october 2007 , when two disks containing the personal details of about half the country 's population went missing			1
junior staff at @entity177 offices in @entity178 , sent the disks by unregistered post to the @entity181 but they never reached their destination , prompting then chancellor @entity183 to announce the loss in the @entity185 , to gasps from @entity187			0
a government spokesman said : ' we take all issues relating to data handling seriously			0
' as such , an immediate investigation has been launched and all necessary steps are being taken			0
' it would be inappropriate to comment further until that investigation has taken place			0
