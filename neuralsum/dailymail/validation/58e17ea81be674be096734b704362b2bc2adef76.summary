at first glance , @entity0 and @entity1 would seem to be your average @entity4 blondes - tall , willowy and blessed by the genetic gods			1
but these are truly funny girls			0
and for the past two years , the sisters have been working on what is being talked about as the new must - watch comedy of the season			2
barely @entity12 takes two vacuous sisters , played by @entity0 and @entity1 , and sends them up as they star in their own reality show - although the characters seem determined to ignore this fact as much as possible			1

their new show , a mockumentary reality show , is ' about @entity4 and the desperation to be famous ' , says actress @entity0 desperate to get on the @entity25 , @entity0 and @entity1 's alter - egos find themselves breaking into @entity29 's home , trying to coax free designer bags away from @entity31 and looking down on anyone who appears on reality tv - even though they 're starring on their own show			1
as the daughters of legendary music producer @entity20 , @entity0 , 34 , and @entity1 , 32 , grew up rubbing shoulders with showbiz royalty			1
indeed , their step - mother is @entity40 , of the @entity41 of @entity43 fame , and their step - sisters are models @entity45 and @entity47			1
but actress @entity0 - who appeared on 90210 - is quick to stress : ' we 're not spoofing @entity41 , or any franchise			1
this show is about @entity4 and the desperation to be famous , we 're pulling the curtain back			1
' married to tennis player @entity54 with a young daughter @entity55 , @entity0 adds : ' i watch reality tv and i 'm not judging anyone who goes on it , but the thought of having my personal life on tv and that being my job is not for me			1
' barely famous launches on march 18 as one of @entity67 's first scripted shows , and @entity1 , who was a writer on @entity69 comedy @entity70 , says : ' it 's really a mockumentary about two sisters who say they would never do a reality show , but they are actually starring on their own show and wo n't admit it anyone			1
' we are not being mean spirited , we 're poking fun of a culture that is such a huge part of our lives today			0
' without judgement , we 're in a really crazy time right now , you become famous first and then you figure out what you want to do with it			2
it 's a really backwards way of having a career			0
' she adds : ' there is no skill involved in acquiring a million @entity92 followers , although that 's a job now , you actually get paid for it , it 's ridiculous			0
guest stars : @entity98 's best pal , actress @entity31 , makes a cameo on @entity12 having a laugh : barely @entity12 debuts on march 18			2
@entity1 ( left ) says : ' there is no skill involved in acquiring a million @entity92 followers , although that 's a job now , you actually get paid for it , it 's ridiculous ' @entity1 's pink blouse pretty in pink here at @entity109 we 're pretty excited about @entity12			1
not just for the sure - to - be hilarious script and famous cameos , but also because if these outfits are anything to go by then we are in for a treat ! posing with her sister @entity0 , here @entity1 looks effortlessly chic in her outfit of an oversized baby pink blouse tucked into a matching pencil skirt			1
the clean lines and soft palette is giving us major outfit inspiration			0
the satin blush shirt sets itself from other blouses on the market with its exaggerated relaxed feel , loosely cut shape and tapered sleeves â€“ topped off with a plunge for a further minimal feel			0

' this makes a regular person feel like a celebrity has a perfect life or relationship or career or body and they forget there are all these apps involved in making you believe it			0
' ' we wanted to make a show that was light and fun , but showed the neuroses between two people filming a reality show and the strategies and manipulation behind it , ' @entity1 says			1
' nothing on the show is pulled from a real experience , it 's pulled from things that you witness in @entity189 , like you go to a hair salon and you 're made to wait an hour and a half because a celebrity just decides to turn up			2
everything 's status related and you can be made to feel like a real loser ! ' despite living in @entity189 , both sisters - who have another sister , @entity199 - are down to earth			2
they were brought up in the @entity201 by their mother @entity202 , @entity20 's second wife , as @entity0 notes : ' our parents divorced when we were five and we lived with our mom in the @entity201			1
our mom was a single mom with three kids and she struggled , so we did n't have the life that people assume			0
' and @entity1 agrees : ' your environment is not as influential as the people you are raised by and we were raised by two people who were very grounded , strong and present parents			2
' my sisters and i grew up in @entity189 and none of us ever went to rehab , got pregnant , got a @entity221 - and we never got into trouble ! we are a testament to our parents			0

he was really young , 13 , when he dropped out of high school and became a professional musician			0
he was around the music scene in 1970s and ' 80s and he never touched a drug and he does n't really drink			0
' our mother is totally removed from @entity4 , she looks beautiful and natural for her age and she has no interest in fame			0
' we were n't raised around an obsession with fame , it 's so destructive			0
if anything , we were raised to believe that 's not what success looks like			0
it 's not everyone knowing your name			0
' as for their step - sister @entity45 , 19 , who was recently named model of the year , @entity1 says : ' @entity45 deserves all the success in the world , she 's getting recognition for something she 's doing well			1

' and she says : ' it was so fun to be in a scene where we have to pretend we do n't know each other , fighting and taking the p * * * s out of celebrity culture - like she needs another free bag ! ' the girls have poured all their heart into the show and @entity0 readily admits : ' this is our baby , we 've given it our blood , sweat and tears			1
