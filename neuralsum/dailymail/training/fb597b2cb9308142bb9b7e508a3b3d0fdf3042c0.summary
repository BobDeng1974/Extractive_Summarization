battle : @entity5 , 29 , ( left before her hair loss ) was left with alopecia ( right ) after being treated with super-strength steroids when fighting leukaemia for the second time the @entity23 , which advises on @entity4 spending , decided her case was not exceptional			1
administration worker @entity5 , who was training to be a nurse until she was taken ill , said the verdict had crushed her remaining confidence			1
' hair makes a woman feel feminine , ' she said			2
' a lady who had a double mastectomy would not be refused a breast reconstruction			0
yet someone who suffered alopecia due to intense chemotherapy is classed differently			0
' the therapy would change my life			1
you never get used to wearing a wig			2

she underwent two rounds of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow transplant , but after this , her hair grew back fine the hair replacement therapy , called the @entity51 system , lasts two years			1
it works by fitting a mesh over any area with little or no hair , pulling the existing hair through the mesh and plaiting tiny wefts of fine real hair to it			0
unlike normal hair extensions , it does n't place stress on the remaining strands			0
ms @entity43 , who has an eight - year - old daughter called @entity66 , had thick dark hair before she first fell ill in august 2005			1

despite the agony of her hair loss , ms @entity43 has been told she will not benefit from the treatment any more than other patients who also qualified			2
but she said she was struggling to cope with her alopecia on a daily basis and now hoped to set up a fundraising page to help other women in the same situation			0
denied : despite the agony of her hair loss , ms @entity43 ( with daughter @entity66 ) has been told she will not benefit from the treatment any more than other patients who also qualified ' i want to help other women so they do n’t have to fight as hard as me just for the right to have some hair , ' she said			2

she relapsed in 2010 and was developed alopecia after being treated with super-strength steroids , which caused her to have thin and patchy hair
says a hair replacement treatment called @entity51 would restore confidence
but local body that advises on @entity4 spending says her case ' not exceptional '
said treatment would change her life - ' you never get used to wearing a wig '
