so far , support for the president 's plan has been sparse , with even fellow @entity17 opposing the use of military force in @entity7			1
he is preparing a media blitz for monday and promised @entity20 in his weekly address on saturday that ' this would not be another @entity23 or @entity24			0
' @entity25 first obtained the official @entity27 collection of 13 videos showing the carnage of the august 21 chemical weapons attack near the rebel stronghold of @entity32			1
the @entity0 administration told lawmakers in the @entity35 - which last week approved plans to attack @entity7 - that the videos ' authenticity has been verified by the intelligence community			1
many of the videos shown to senators can be found on @entity43			2
but what makes this footage unique is the fact that it has been verified by intelligence officials			2
in one of the more heartbreaking videos , a room is full of what appear to be the lifeless bodies of dozens of children			1
in another , men are seen foaming at the mouth and having convulsions			1
in all , 1,429 people were killed in the vicious attack , including at least 426 children			1
the attack allegedly was carried out by the @entity13 regime , and @entity20 lawmakers are now deciding whether a military response is warranted			1
@entity0 added in his weekly address : " i know that the @entity20 people are weary after a decade of war , even as the war in @entity23 has ended , and the war in @entity24 is winding down			1
that 's why we 're not putting our troops in the middle of somebody else 's war			0
" attacks : the chemical gas attacks occurred on august 21 in the rebel strongholds near @entity108 and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead tradition : @entity111 tradition requires the dead to be wrapped in a religious shroud and buried within 24 hours of death former @entity115 ambassador @entity115 told the network that the footage could be vital in the @entity0 administration 's quest to convince @entity120 and the general public that military force against @entity7 is justified			1
' that video will sensitize the @entity20 people that this is n't just an intervention , that this is a military strike to stop that type of atrocity , ' @entity115 , a former congressman and former governor of @entity124 , said			1
persuasion : senator @entity130 is urging all members of @entity120 to view the video before voting on intervening in @entity7 babies : of the 1,429 people killed in the attack , at least 426 were children @entity35 chairwoman @entity130 - who last week voted in favor of military intervention in @entity7 - has seen the shocking videos and wants all members of @entity120 to watch them before deciding whether military intervention is justified			1
president @entity0 prepared for a national address tuesday as a growing number of lawmakers , including fellow @entity17 , opposed the use of force			1
the @entity20 public did n't yet appear persuaded by @entity0 's argument that action is needed to deter the future use of chemical weapons			1
@entity20 secretary of state @entity152 , who met with more than two dozen @entity154 foreign ministers on saturday , insisted that international backing to take strong action against @entity7 president @entity13 's regime was growing , not receding			1
@entity152 noted that the ministers , who held an informal meeting of the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 , made powerful statements condemning the attack , and that increasingly there was a sense of conviction that @entity13 was to blame			2
@entity152 said the @entity20 had agreed to provide additional information to those ministers who were not yet convinced that @entity13 orchestrated the attack			2
children lay dying on the floor in a suburb of @entity108 after a chemical attack symptoms : one of the many symtoms of syrin poisoning is foaming at the mouth and convulsions the @entity160 endorsed a ' clear and strong response ' to a chemical weapons attack but did n't indicate what type of response they were backing			1
it also said that evidence strongly points to the @entity7 government			1
still , the @entity160 urged the @entity20 to delay possible military action until @entity189 inspectors report their findings			2
the @entity154 were divided on whether military action would be effective			2
@entity192 's @entity191 has voted against military action			2
@entity193 had been ready to act last week but held off when @entity0 declared that he would seek the backing of @entity120			1
@entity193 president @entity196 's announcement appeared to catch @entity193 foreign minister @entity197 off guard			0
earlier on friday , @entity197 told @entity160 foreign ministers that there was no need to wait for the @entity189 report because it would simply confirm what was already known - that the chemical weapons attack had occurred - but would not say who was responsible			0
@entity196 indicated saturday that the @entity189 report could be ready in a matter of days , and he would then be prepared to make a decision on a @entity193 intervention			0
' i said ... that i wanted to wait for the inspectors ' report , which i know will be ready within a very reasonable time period , that is , not that far from the decision of the @entity120 , ' he told @entity193 television after meeting with @entity216 president @entity215 in @entity217 , @entity193			2
' so , at that moment , i 'll have all the necessary elements that will let me tell the @entity193 people the decision i have made for @entity193			0
' however , @entity220 , chief @entity189 spokesman , insisted that there would be no preliminary report			0
the report on the aug. 21 attack will be given to the @entity225 and other member states once the lab analysis is complete , @entity220 said			0
rescuers try to help a boy through a convulsion after a syrin gas attack in a suburb of @entity108 in august ' we are not saying when that will be , except as soon as feasible , ' he told @entity235			2
' this is a scientific timeline , not a political timeline			0
' @entity152 traveled saturday from @entity162 to @entity238 to meet with @entity193 official and representatives of the @entity241			0
he joined @entity193 foreign minister @entity197 in hailing the @entity160 statement			0
' some do n't believe in taking military action ever at all , ' @entity152 said			0
' and some want to wait for one thing or another , but the overwhelming support is moving in the direction of holding the @entity13 regime accountable			0
' @entity152 added : ' this is growing , not receding in terms of the global sense of outrage of what has happened			0
' @entity197 said if no action were taken , there would be little hope for a political solution to the crisis			0
@entity0 and other administration officials were preparing a dayslong push to gain public and congressional support for a strike on @entity7			1
the challenges they faced were apparent saturday			0
sen. @entity267 , an @entity269 @entity268 , said he would oppose military action , and dozens of people picketed outside the @entity27 against @entity0 's request			1
@entity267 said in a statement that the administration had not met his criteria for gaining his support : a compelling national security interest , a clearly defined mission with a definitive end , and a coalition of allies			0
support : president @entity0 and secretary @entity152 likely will not be able to get @entity120 support for intervention in @entity7 ' unless there 's some new information or some new development or circumstance , i just do n't see me changing my vote at this point , ' he told @entity235 in an interview			1
protesters at the @entity27 chanted ' they say more war ; we say no war ' and said their picket line marked a line @entity120 should not cross as it prepared to vote on the issue			2
' punishment is not at odds with a political solution , ' @entity197 said			0
' @entity13 will not participate in any negotiation as long as he believes himself to be invincible			0
' saturday 's developments left both the @entity20 and @entity154 in a waiting game			0
while the @entity154 awaited the @entity189 inspection report , the @entity0 administration waited to see if @entity120 would back a use of force			1
meantime , administration officials continued to lobby lawmakers by phone to vote to authorize a limited military strike against the @entity13 regime			0
the first @entity35 vote , expected wednesday , was likely to be on a resolution authorizing the " limited and specified use " of @entity20 armed forces against @entity7 for no more than 90 days and barring @entity20 ground troops from combat			2
a final vote in the 100 - member chamber was expected at week 's end			0
a @entity27 vote is likely the week of sept. 16			0
asked about the @entity20 public 's uneasiness about getting involved in another conflict , @entity152 reiterated his view that the use of chemical weapons in the @entity7 conflict was a threat to the @entity20 ' this case has not yet been made to the @entity20 people for more than a few days and we will continue to make the case to the @entity20 people , ' @entity152 said in @entity238			1
' this concerns ever @entity20 's security			0
