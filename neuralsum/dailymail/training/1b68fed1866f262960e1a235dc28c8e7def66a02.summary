the @entity1 military denied the existence of any such shipment and said a scientific research facility outside @entity5 was hit			1
the attack adds a potentially flammable new element to tensions already heightened by @entity1 's civil war			0
it was the latest salvo in @entity3 's long - running effort to disrupt the @entity46 militia 's quest to build an arsenal capable of defending against @entity3 's air force and spreading destruction inside the jewish state			2
regional security officials said the strike , which occurred overnight tuesday , targeted a site near the @entity7 border , while a @entity1 army statement said it destroyed a military research center northwest of the capital , @entity5			1
they appeared to be referring to the same incident			0
a @entity28 sa - 17			0
it is described as a ' game - changer ' that could shoot down @entity3 's air forces @entity24 officials said the target was a truck convoy that @entity3 believed was carrying sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons bound for @entity33 in @entity7			1
they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak about the operation			0

in a statement , the @entity1 military denied the existence of any such shipment and said a scientific research facility outside @entity5 was hit by the @entity3 warplanes			1
anger : both @entity1 and @entity28 condemned the airstrike			1
@entity1 media called it a ' terrorist attack ' the @entity3 military declined to comment			1
however , many in @entity3 worry that as @entity1 president @entity92 loses power , he could strike back by transferring chemical or advanced weapons to @entity33 , which is neighboring @entity7 's most powerful military force and is committed to @entity3 's destruction			1
@entity28 has expressed concern at an alleged @entity3 attack on @entity1 , saying such a strike would be an unacceptable violation of the @entity102			1
@entity28 has steadfastly refused to denounce @entity1 president @entity92 during the 22 - month conflict that has killed more than 60,000 people			1
the @entity105 said : ' if this information is confirmed , then we are dealing with unprovoked attacks on targets on the territory of a sovereign country , which blatantly violates the @entity102 and is unacceptable , no matter the motives to justify it			0
' fear : a @entity116 fighter drags his comrade who was shot by sniper fire during heavy fighting in the @entity121 neighbourhood of @entity5 yesterday the fighter on the right died soon after being shot			0
he joins an estimated 60,000 who have lost their lives during the @entity1 civil war the airstrike follows decades of enmity between @entity3 and allies @entity1 and @entity33 , which consider the jewish state their mortal enemy			2
the situation has been further complicated by the civil war raging in @entity1 between the @entity92 regime and rebel brigades seeking his ouster			0
the war has sapped @entity92 's power and threatens to deprive @entity33 of a key supporter , in addition to its land corridor to @entity2			0
the two countries provide @entity33 with the bulk of its funding and arms			0
a @entity1 military statement read aloud on state tv wednesday said low - flying @entity3 jets crossed into @entity1 over the @entity3 - occupied @entity150 and bombed a military research center in the area of @entity153 , northwest of @entity5			1
the strike destroyed the center and damaged a nearby building , killing two workers and wounding five others , the statement said			0
the military denied the existence of any convoy bound for @entity7 , saying the center was responsible for ' raising the level of resistance and self - defense ' of @entity1 's military			2
@entity5 has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war			0
rebels are fighting to oust the @entity173 regime @entity28 has refused to condemn the actions of government forces led by @entity92 ' this proves that @entity3 is the instigator , beneficiary and sometimes executor of the terrorist acts targeting @entity1 and its people , ' the statement said			1
@entity3 and @entity33 fought an inconclusive 34 - day war in 2006 that left 1,200 @entity7 and 160 @entity3 dead			0
while the border has been largely quiet since , the struggle has taken other forms			0
@entity33 has accused @entity3 of assassinating a top commander , and @entity3 blamed @entity33 and @entity2 for a july 2012 attack on @entity3 tourists in @entity190			2
in october , @entity33 launched an @entity2 - made reconnaissance drone over @entity3 , using the incident to brag about its expanding capabilities			2
@entity3 officials believe that @entity33 's arsenal has markedly improved since 2006 , now boasting tens of thousands of rockets and missiles and the ability to strike almost anywhere inside @entity3			1
@entity3 suspects that @entity5 obtained a battery of @entity201 from @entity28 after an alleged @entity3 airstrike in 2007 that destroyed an unfinished @entity1 nuclear reactor			1
carnage : buildings damaged by what activists said were missiles fired by a @entity1 @entity209 fighter jet loyal to president @entity92 earlier this month earlier this week , @entity3 prime minister @entity211 warned of the dangers of @entity1 's ' deadly weapons , ' saying the country is ' increasingly coming apart			1
' the same day , @entity3 moved a battery of its new ' @entity217 ' rocket defense system to the northern city of @entity219 , which was battered by @entity33 rocket fire in the 2006 war			0
the @entity3 army called that move ' routine '			0
@entity1 , however , cast the airstrike in a different light , linked to the country 's civil war , which it blames on terrorists carrying out an international conspiracy			0
despite its icy relations with @entity92 , @entity3 has remained on the sidelines of efforts to topple him , while keeping up defenses against possible attacks			0
@entity1 gather around the bodies of civilians , who were executed and dumped in the @entity239 river in @entity240 yesterday			0
@entity1 's opposition charged that ' global inaction ' was giving @entity92 's regime a license to kill @entity3 defense officials have carefully monitored @entity1 's chemical weapons , fearing @entity92 could deploy them or lose control of them to extremist fighters among the rebels			1
president @entity251 has called the use of chemical weapons a ' red line ' that if crossed could prompt direct @entity24 intervention , though @entity24 officials have said @entity1 's stockpiles still appear to be under government control			1
the strike was @entity3 's first inside @entity1 since september 2007 , when warplanes destroyed a site that the @entity263 nuclear watchdog deemed likely to be a nuclear reactor			1
@entity1 denied the claim , saying the building was a non-nuclear military site			2
a rebel fighter stands in front of a building after they took over the village of @entity273 following fighting against @entity276 regime forces , yesterday @entity1 allowed international inspectors to visit the bombed site in 2008 , but it has refused to allow nuclear inspectors new access			0
this has heightened suspicions that @entity1 has something to hide , along with its decision to level the destroyed structure and build on its site			2
in 2006 , @entity3 warplanes flew over @entity92 's palace in a show of force after @entity1 - backed militants captured an @entity3 soldier in the @entity293			2
and in 2003 , @entity3 warplanes attacked a suspected militant training camp just north of the @entity1 capital , in response to an @entity298 suicide bombing in the city of @entity219 that killed 21 @entity3			2
@entity1 vowed to retaliate for both attacks but never did			0
in @entity7 , which borders both @entity3 and @entity1 , the military and the @entity263 agency tasked with monitoring the border with @entity3 said @entity3 warplanes have sharply increased their activity in the past week			1
@entity3 violations of @entity7 airspace are not uncommon , and it was unclear if the recent activity was related to the strike in @entity1			1
@entity1 's primary conflict with @entity3 is over the @entity150 , which @entity3 occupied in the 1967 war			2
@entity1 demands the area back as part of any peace deal			0
despite the hostility , @entity1 has kept the border quiet since the 1973 @entity318 war and has never retaliated for @entity3 attacks			2
in may 2011 , only two months after the uprising against @entity92 started , hundreds of @entity320 overran the tightly controlled @entity1 - @entity3 frontier in a move widely thought to have been facilitated by the @entity92 regime to divert the world 's gaze from his growing troubles at home .			2

@entity2 minister says @entity3 air strike will have implications for @entity21
@entity24 officials say strike by @entity3 destroyed @entity28 anti-air missiles
@entity1 authorities say a military research centre was hit , @entity3 is silent
