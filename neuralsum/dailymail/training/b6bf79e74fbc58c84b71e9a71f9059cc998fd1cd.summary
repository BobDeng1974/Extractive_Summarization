by @entity0 published : 10:01 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 11:21 est , 9 october 2012 when @entity3 and @entity4 were born at 23 weeks with holes in their hearts , their parents were told to expect the worst			1
the twins weighed just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz each and doctors said it would be a miracle if even one of them survived unscathed			1
as well as the holes in their hearts , the boys , who are not identical , had bowel problems and were unable to breathe for themselves			1
at just two weeks old , @entity3 had to undergo gruelling open heart surgery , with his brother following a fortnight later			1
a small miracle : @entity16 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) have amazed medics after they survived being born more than four months premature			1
both were born with holes in their hearts , and had to undergo surgery just weeks after being born medics also operated on them both to correct bowel problems , performed laser treatment to stimulate their underdeveloped eyes , and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them breathe			1
and despite the odds being stacked against them , the twins have clung to life			2
their mother @entity30 , 20 , said : ‘ it was the scariest time of our lives			2
’ miss @entity30 , who is engaged to the children ’s father , @entity34 , had a smooth pregnancy until her waters to @entity3 ’s sack broke at 21 weeks			1
the couple , who live in @entity40 , @entity41 , spent the next two weeks at the @entity42 in @entity43 with doctors desperately trying to prevent @entity30 going into labour , due to the risks of giving birth too prematurely			1
but at 23 weeks , miss @entity30 began suffering cramp - like pains and realised @entity3 ’s arrival was imminent			1
he was born 15 minutes later and placed straight into an incubator and onto a ventilator			2
@entity52 arrived two - and - a - half hours later			0
it soon became clear that both boys had holes in their hearts			0
they underwent risky three - hour heart and bowel operations at the @entity60 in @entity61			1
miss @entity30 , who was originally given a due date of last week , said : ‘ the doctors told us to be prepared to lose them because the chances of even one of them surviving the surgery was so small			0
' unique and a complete rarity ' : doctors had warned the boys ' parents @entity30 and @entity34 ( pictured ) to expect the worst			0
the twins ' recovery has been hailed as a miracle given how premature and unwell they were @entity3 , who now weighs 5lb , has been allowed home , but requires a round - the - clock supply of oxygen			1
at 4lb 8oz , @entity52 is still in hospital but should be discharged over the next few weeks			0
' to get to this stage with one of them home and the other almost ready to come home is just mind - blowing , ' said miss @entity30			0
' we never thought we ’d get to this stage			0
' i am the proudest mum in the world and they ’re our little miracles			0
' we are so lucky to have them both with us and i would n’t wish what we have been through on anybody			0
' i cried every night because i could n’t hold my babies , we were n’t allowed to touch them			0
i did n’t feel like a proper mum			0
' now after everything they have been through , we just ca n’t believe they are still here			0
' she added : ‘ @entity3 is laid back and quiet like @entity34 , but @entity52 is bad - tempered and loud like me			2
' dr @entity101 , a consultant neonatologist at the @entity42 and the doctor who helped deliver the babies , said they are the only set of twins he has ever known to survive being born so prematurely in his 20 - year career			1
he described the miniature pair as ‘ unique and a complete rarity ’			0
he said : ‘ only about one in 10 babies born at 23 weeks survives and of those who make it , one in two of them will be brain damaged			1
‘ therefore we ’re talking about just one out of 20 babies will come out of this without damage			2
‘ for both twins to make it and to make it without brain damage is very , very rare to say the least			1
‘ in fact , i am not aware of any 23 - week twins surviving in this region and it is definitely a first in this hospital			2
‘ i was there when they were born and i did not think they would survive , they were very , very small , and had very thin skin			2
‘ they have had some complications and operations in the early days , but it is heartening to know that both of them have come out of this winners and virtually @entity142 is just amazing			0

@entity3 and @entity4 born at 23 weeks with heart , bowel and breathing problems
both *progressing* well despite a one in 20 chance of escaping brain damage
doctors believe they may be the *youngest* ever twins to survive
