miss @entity5 , who was targeted after her mother @entity20 made controversial remarks about the footballer and convicted rapist @entity23 , last night welcomed the move , saying that the most sickening comments amounted to ‘ online terrorism ’			1
the tougher new legislation is already being dubbed ‘ @entity1 ’ after her public stance against the disturbing messages			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ these internet trolls are cowards who are poisoning our national life			1
‘ no one would permit such venom in person , so there should be no place for it on social media			0
that is why we are determined to quadruple the current six - month sentence			1
‘ as the terrible case of @entity5 showed last week , people are being abused online in the most crude and degrading fashion			1
‘ this is a law to combat cruelty – and marks our determination to take a stand against a baying cyber-mob			0
we must send out a clear message : if you troll you risk being behind bars for two years			0
’ currently , offenders who subject their victims to sexually offensive , verbally abusive or threatening material on the internet can only be prosecuted in magistrates courts under the @entity60 , which carries a maximum prison sentence of six months			1
but the planned changes will allow magistrates to pass on serious cases to the crown courts , where offenders would face a maximum sentence of 24 months			1
miss @entity5 , 27 , was targeted with what she described as ‘ extremely chilling and cowardly ’ threats after she defended her mother for suggesting on a tv panel show that mr @entity23 ’s offence was less serious because he had not physically harmed the teenager he attacked			1
last night miss @entity5 said it was right for mr @entity2 to update the ten - year - old law , since it pre-dates @entity76			1
she told @entity17 : ‘ the current law obviously needs to be reviewed			0
it needs to be accepted that physical threats should not fall under the “ freedom of speech ” umbrella			2
' it should be seen as online terrorism and it should be illegal			0
some sections of the @entity97 supporters chanted : ‘ @entity104 , @entity104			0
he can do what he wants ’ as the @entity107 team visited @entity108			0
the fans ’ show of support follows reports @entity23 was to be offered a two - year £ 500,000 contract by his former club – although @entity97 insist they have made no such decision			1
@entity20 ’s comments on @entity23 ’s case led to the trolling of her daughter @entity118			1
@entity120 presenter @entity119 said she would quit her role as a ‘ patron ’ of @entity97 if the club were to re-sign @entity23			1
@entity119 told @entity124 : ‘ you will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal			0
’ @entity130 vice-chairman and @entity131 star @entity129 agreed , saying there is ‘ no place anywhere in football ’ for @entity23			2
former @entity135 , 25 , was released last week after serving half of a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman			2
her remarks come after her father , tv presenter @entity88 , warned the trolls : ‘ @entity142 awaits you			2
’ the changes will be made as an amendment to the @entity146 currently going through @entity147			0
they would also give the police more time to collect enough evidence to enable successful prosecutions to be brought			0
earlier this month , 63 - year - old @entity152 , who subjected the family of missing @entity154 to online abuse , was found dead in a hotel after being confronted outside her home by a @entity159 reporter			2
mrs @entity152 was one of a number of trolls who compounded @entity163 and @entity165 ’s distress by abusing them on social media			2
one tweet read : ‘ # mccann to @entity165 and @entity163 , you will be hated by millions for the rest of your miserable , evil , conniving lives , have a nice day ! ’ mr @entity174 commented at the time : ‘ clearly something needs to be done about the abuse on the internet			2
i think we probably need more people charged			0
’ miss @entity5 explained last week why she had gone public with the threats , saying : ‘ i always ignore the disgusting troll tweets i get because i honestly do not want to give them any attention			1
@entity165 and @entity174 have been abused on social media sites such as @entity76 and @entity186 over the disappearance of their daughter in 2007 ‘ but the tweet in question took it to another level and i wanted to stand up against it			2
‘ there is a line where rationality ends and criminality begins			0
the person who threatened me crossed that line			0
’ dr @entity201 , consultant psychiatrist at @entity202 , @entity203 , south - west @entity204 , told @entity17 : ' the sadistic pleasure derived by trolling may have an addictive quality to it and the sense of power for the troll may be difficult to resist			0
' the most useful intervention is to be reminded that the emotional pain inflicted is real and that they are not able to hide behind apparent anonymity , and to be held legally accountable for the actions for which they have mental capacity and intend to make			0
' he said that the illusion of anonymity ' facilitates for some callous and wounding attacks upon people which for the @entity223 troll provides sadistic pleasure combined with the false reassurance that the attack is ' not really real ' due to the lack of real face to face contact of the ' hit and run ' style of encounter , often hidden behind the camouflage of the screen name			0
' the move by mr @entity2 follows the announcement he would include a measure in the @entity146 to make it an offence to post so - called ‘ revenge pornography ’ online , which would also carry a maximum jail term of two years .			1
