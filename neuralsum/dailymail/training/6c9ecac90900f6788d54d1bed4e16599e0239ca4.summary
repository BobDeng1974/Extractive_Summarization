the influential period @entity0 , which ceased in 1980 , used a panel of industry experts to scrutinize actress ' body proportions by @entity5 published : 14:48 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 15:07 est , 19 april 2013 winning proportions : @entity7 was voted as having the best figure in @entity9 in the 1931 issue of @entity11 offering a fascinating insight into how the ' ideal ' body type has changed over the years , a 1931 magazine debates which leading lady has the ' best figure in @entity9 '			1
twenty - one women were selected by the influential period @entity0 , which ceased publication in 1980 , with their statistics scrutinized by a panel of industry experts			1
even their glove and wrist sizes were up for assessment			1
overall the late @entity24 movie star @entity7 , then 26 , was crowned winner - beating the likes of @entity27 and @entity28 with her ' warmly curved ' silhouette			1
the actress , who famously had a love affair with @entity32 ten years her junior , stood 5ft 4.5in tall and weighed 120lbs according to the article			1
her bust measured 33in , her waist 25in and hips 36in			1
' her selection definitely establishes the superiority of the roundly turned , warmly curved figure			1
she is a far hail from the straight up and down type , ' the magazine notes			1
@entity44 highlights that to a modern audience sensitive to body issues , the magazine feature seems ' abhorrent ' with women ’s measurements being ' explicitly ' assessed			1
however the perception of the ideal body type was shifting greatly at the time			1
during the @entity55 , in the aftermath of @entity53 , a lean , flat - chested silhouette and generally androgynous appearance was in vogue			2
but by the early @entity58 fashion slowly started gravitating towards a fuller and more feminine figure			2
' the general notion of what is a good figure no longer seems to be what [ it ] was a year or more ago when , influenced by the unsound fad which glorifies boyish forms , ' the magazine continues			2
' mrs and @entity67 survived on lamb chops and pineapple , oranges and lettuce			2
' the judging panel included @entity74 producer @entity73			1
he eliminated @entity75 starlet @entity27 because he felt she was too slim			2
' backbones should not be social , protruding like clipped wings when low cut evening gowns are worn ' ' he feels @entity27 should weigh more than she does , be closer to the weight she was in @entity75 before she reduced to comply with our @entity81 picture ideals , ' the editorial states			2
in the end he made his final choice from @entity86 , @entity7 , @entity87 and @entity88 - the ‘ four girls who weigh the most for their height ’			2
' there is no sense of frailty about them			2
they are , in every instance , a far hail from any boyish form , and they are not the underdeveloped , adolescent type , ' he explained , before selecting @entity103 as winner			0
runners - up : ( from left ) @entity86 interested judges because of her ' well - developed ' figure , @entity28 was rated high by one judge and @entity110 came very near to being winner in the ' contest ' fellow judge @entity113 , an @entity81 artist who was responsible for many of the photoplay front covers , also expressed distaste for skinny women			0
should not be social , protruding like clipped wings when low cut evening gowns are worn , ' he warned			0
' they rob a women a that lovely , rounded look			0
they are reminders of the mechanism of the body , of joint fitting into joint			1
joints of course are very important , but they function quite as efficiently unseen			0
' he immediately eliminated two girls from his list for this reason and three more because when they stood with their feet together ' daylight was visible between their knees			0
' in the end he plumped for the film and stage star @entity88 for her ' glowing warmth ' and ' lovely symmetry '			0
vital statistics : this chart from a 1931 issue of @entity147 magazine reveals how @entity9 's leading ladies measured - up - it states that many went on ' starvation diets ' to conform to ' @entity81 picture ideals ' @entity153 - based doctor @entity152 , also weighed in on the discussion			0
he wrote : ' i most earnestly hope that a star who has curves and looks as a women should look will be granted as having @entity9 's best figure			0
' there was something in that old rumor about men preferring a more curved figure than women feel ideal ' ' i know the tremendous influence the screen exerts on modern life			0
and i am a little dismayed by the number of girls and young women who come to my office suffering from anemia and low blood pressure			0
too often their ailments can be traced to ill - advised and strenuous dieting			0
’ like @entity73 he picked @entity103 as the star with the best body			1
but going against the general verdict , the only female judge , famed dressmaker @entity184 , opted for the slimmer actress @entity185			1
' miss @entity185 is a trifle slim perhaps , but to my mind , she more than atones for this but her carriage and by the way her head is placed on her gracious shoulders , ' the late fashion expert said			0
controversial : the march 1931 issue of @entity0 asked which leading lady had the ' best figure in @entity9 ' ' it looks as if there was something in that old rumor about men preferring a more curved figure than women feel ideal , ' the magazine followed			1
in the end @entity103 , who was away from the acting scene at the time due to a kidney infection , was voted as having the best figure in @entity9 with 13 points			0
@entity88 was runner - up			0
the magazine concludes : ' beauty is what it always has been and always will be , the result of health			0
' the article came from the march 1931 issue of @entity0 , the premier film fan magazine of @entity9 from its 1911 founding through the 1950s .			1
