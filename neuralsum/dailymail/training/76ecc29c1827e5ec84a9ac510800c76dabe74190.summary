a transformer - style ‘ flying car ’ being developed by an @entity4 company could soon spell the end of runways			0
the company ’s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane			0
while this ‘ @entity15 ’ vehicle is still some way from development , the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the ‘ @entity20 ’			2
‘ this opens up flying to a much larger range of possible terrains , from backyards and rough fields , to a boat on the sea , ’ the company writes on its @entity33 campaign			0
users can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its body			1
users can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its body pictured on the left is a prototype flown on april , and the right image shows what the current design looks like in this mode , the craft is powered by two rear props allowing it to cover bigger distances at 83 mph ( 134 km / h )			1
for slow - speed flight , they craft ’s weight can be cut by temporarily removing its wings and tail			1
it will then travel at 35mph ( 56 km / h )			2
according to @entity69 , flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed - wing			1
nose cones on the drone can also be changed , allowing it to carry different gadgets such as a hd camera , according to a report in @entity78			0
in ‘ hornet configuration ’ , without the tail and wings , the craft has a range of 14 miles ( 22km ) and in ‘ blade configuration ’ it can travel for 43 miles ( 69km )			1
the @entity20 is controlled using a radio remote control unit that comes with a live - streaming video screen			1
users also have the option of removing the gps module from the drone , and carrying it with them so that it acts as a homing beacon			0
the patent pending switchblade mechanism forms the basis of the transformation of @entity15 and @entity20			2
airplanes need to fly fast and to fly fast you need to be as aerodynamically clean as possible			0
that 's why airplanes are long and narrow , somewhat drop - shaped and with as few ' things ' sticking out as possible			0
for vertical take - off and landing on the other hand , you need to be the opposite of aerodynamic			1
the more things you have sticking out producing lift ( think of the extreme of a parachute for example ) the easier it is to hover			0
the craft can switch between plane and quadcopter mode with a special ' switchblade ' this is one of the main reasons that helicopters which a great at hover , are not very good at forward flight , being slow as well as needing a lot of fuel			1
the switchblade mechanism transforms an aircraft from the aerodynamically clean airplane configuration to the @entity125 configuration , which features a number of rotors that together have a large rotor disc area that is ideal for hovering at low power			1
according to @entity69 , flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed - wing			1
pictured are the craft 's key features the @entity20 is controlled using a radio remote control unit that comes with a live - streaming video screen a ready - to - fly package is currently being advertised on @entity33 for $ 899			1
shipping is estimated for july , if the @entity33 is able to raise enough funds			0
the @entity20 is based on the larger concept of the @entity15 transforming vehicle , which was unveiled last year			2
in normal flight , the @entity15 uses two 150 bhp electric motors in the tail , but when switching from horizontal to vertical flight , a set of four ' switchblade ' rotor arms fold out from the fuselage to take the load			1
there are four 80 bhp electric motors running the four main rotors , plus another four 10 bhp rotors to providing stability in crosswinds			0
according to @entity69 , the smaller rotors can accelerate faster than the larger ones , so they can respond faster to sudden gusts			0
on the ground , the 9.5 m ( 31 ft ) wing span can be stowed away , and electric motors mounted in the wheels drive the craft along at 75 mph ( 112 kph ) - although be warned , it is 8.4 m ( 27.5 ft ) long			2

@entity20 has four propellers that allow it to perform vertical take - offs
users can instruct aircraft to retract its landing gear and four rotor props
they can also temporarily remove its wings and tail so it can travel *farther*
it flies for 24 minutes in quadcopter mode and 40 minutes as a fixed - wing
its top speed is 83 mph ( 134 km / h ) in ' blade ' or fixed wing configuration
