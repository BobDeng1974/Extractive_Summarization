by @entity0 published : 16:07 est , 20 october 2012 updated : 08:50 est , 21 october 2012 a @entity2 schoolgirl orphaned in the @entity4 gun massacre said her father was standing next to her when the killer first struck , it emerged today			1
it is the chilling testament of @entity9 , seven , which is helping detectives piece together the sequence of the quadruple slaughter in eastern @entity13			1
@entity15 ’s father , @entity18 engineer @entity16 , 50 , his dentist wife @entity20 , 47 , and his 74 - year - old @entity23 mother - in - law , @entity22 , all died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire on september 5			1
new developments : investigators now believe @entity29 cyclist @entity28 was killed before the @entity31 family but details of a new ballistics report leaked to @entity35 newspaper on friday suggest that @entity29 cyclist @entity28 , a 45 - year - old nuclear industry worker , was the primary target			1
he was hit by the first stream of bullets before the ‘ frenzied ’ gunman turned his attention on mr @entity31 , who had parked the family @entity42 in a layby close to the village of @entity45			1
@entity46 , the prosecutor in nearby @entity47 who is leading the investigation , confirmed that mr @entity31 had got out of the car with @entity15 , while denying that any conclusions had been drawn from the ballistics report			1
but today senior police officers working on the @entity29 inquiry confirmed that it was in fact @entity15 who was supplying key evidence			1
‘ the little girl remembers key facts - her testament is crucial , ’ said one , who said many of @entity15 ’s recollections were corroborated by new forensic evidence			1
sand and gravel was , for example , found on the soles of mr @entity68 ’s shoes - proving that he had been outside the car			1
he then got back into the driver ’s seat , locked the doors , and tried to get away - but in his panic put the @entity42 into reverse and became stuck in a muddy bank			1
this allowed the gunman to fire bullets into the heads of all the seated adults , before returning to finish mr @entity28 off			1
burial : relatives of @entity28 at @entity84 after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation violent killings : aerospace engineer @entity16 from @entity18 , was murdered in a suspected assassination alongside his wife and mother - in - law mr @entity28 ’s glasses and bicycle pump were also found ‘ a fair distance ’ from where his lifeless body was found lying next to the car , said the source , suggesting it had been moved			2
the first witness on the scene - an ex @entity101 serviceman from @entity2 - confirmed that the engine of the car was still running and all the doors were locked			2
@entity15 , who had been shot in a shoulder and pistol whipped around the head was also still outside the car - suggesting that her terrified family was about to leave her behind			2
her sister @entity110 , four , was inside the @entity42 all along , apparently hiding underneath her mother ’s dress , and was unscathed but severely traumatised			2
both little girls are currently back in @entity2 at a secret address where they are being looked after by family and social workers			2
mr @entity46 confirmed that @entity2 detectives were in touch with the girls , and were being kept informed about any information which they might offer of their own accord			1
this means that there are no formal police interviews taking place - but @entity15 is slowly being ‘ coaxed ’ into saying what happened			2
one of her earliest recollections was that ‘ one bad man ’ had been shooting people , but more information is now being offered			2
mr @entity46 has been working on a theory that the atrocity was linked to a dispute mr @entity31 was having with his brother , @entity134 , over their father ’s will			2
but today he said that some £ 750,000 kept by the @entity138 in a bank account in @entity140 - around an hour ’s drive from @entity45 - remained untouched			0
‘ the account had not moved for a very long time , ’ said mr @entity46			0
instead , the focus of the investigation is now on mr @entity28 , who was hit by up to seven bullets in the attack			0
@entity29 police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at @entity151 during their investigations until now he was regularly described by detectives as ‘ collateral damage ’ during what looked like the professional assassination of mr @entity31			1
no family or friends of mr @entity28 have spoken about his death , nor released a photograph of the father of three , who lived in nearby ugine			0
a month ago his body was ‘ temporarily buried ’ in a secret ceremony , even though this went against the wishes of his relatives , who had asked for him to be cremated			1
forensic experts wanted to examine his body for clues , which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed			0
thirty people attended the funeral , which took place in a closed burial site which was deliberately kept hidden from the media			0
the family left their @entity177 campsite after two nights and moved to the @entity180 campsite , which overlooks @entity47 peaceful spot : walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of @entity45 where the @entity138 and @entity28 were murdered @entity29 investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘ double life ’ and been the intended target of the shooting			0
mr @entity28 worked for @entity193 , a subsidiary of the @entity195 , specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers			0
@entity193 is owned by the @entity195 which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in @entity199 that it had flouted @entity201 sanctions by providing @entity202 with enriched uranium			0
he had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his new partner , a pharmacist , gave birth in june			0
mr @entity28 was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside			0
he was identified after his partner , worried about not seeing him return , alerted the police			0
police have also revealed they are looking for a motorcyclist who was seen in the vicinity of the crime scene at around 4pm - within half an hour of the killings			0
a local farmer said he saw the rider looking ‘ unsure of the route ’ , and struggling to manoeuvre his bike over pot - holed roads			0
@entity224 , a 53 - year - old @entity225 who used to be in the @entity101 , was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle .			0
