@entity0 versus @entity1 is the fight which just keeps on giving			1
especially to @entity0 and @entity1			2
the initial projection of a purse split of $ 150million to the @entity7 man and $ 100m to the @entity1 has just been upwardly revised by @entity1 's promoter			1
@entity9 is now predicting a ' $ 300m distribution ' to the protagonists - $ 180m to @entity0 and $ 120m to @entity1 under their 60 - 40 percent agreement			1
@entity0 could earn $ 180m from his may 2 fight with @entity1 given the huge public interest @entity1 will receive 40 per cent of the purse , which could hit $ 120m on projected record pay - per - view buys @entity0 laughs while watching the @entity19 take on the @entity20 those figures are based on @entity9 's firm expectation that this , the richest fight of all time , will not just break the pay - per - view record in @entity26 – but double it			1
he says : ' we are looking at four to five million buys			0
the interest is amazing , even from people who do not follow boxing , even people who do n't follow any sports			0
' wherever you go everyone is talking about this fight			0
' they are also bending his ear for tickets in the 16,000 - capacity @entity42 in @entity43 on may 2			2
@entity9 has already told a host of a-list celebrities : ' no comps this time			0
the demand is so huge that the only answer is everyone has to pay			0
' the only free ticket promised by @entity9 is for female @entity52 star @entity51 , who he heard was preparing to spend all her career fight winnings thus far on a seat as close to ringside as that amount could buy			2
promoter @entity9 believes there will be between ' four and five million buys ' of the fight on may 2 @entity9 has only promised one free ticket to the @entity43 showdown - to @entity52 star @entity51 @entity1 , pictured working out in @entity64 , has already started preparing for his fight with @entity0 tickets are expected to be priced from the lowest at $ 1,250 to upwards of $ 6,000 for a seat at ringside			1
but it is unlikely any at all will go on general sale			0
purchases may well be restricted to those holding a $ 250,000 credit line , or higher , at the @entity76 group of casinos on the @entity43			2
although there will of course be a thriving black market at eye - watering prices			0
speaking at an @entity82 fights night in @entity83 , @entity9 said : ' one guy offered me a hundred grand for a ticket			0
' then he joked : ' i told him he could have my seat for $ 200,000			0
' the double - up factor will begin with the @entity90 taking $ 40m at the box office , compared with the previous high - mark of $ 20m for @entity0 v @entity93 in september 2013			2
but it is the pay - per - view tv sales – with rival networks @entity98 and @entity99 sharing the broadcast – which will generate most of the revenue			1
the record number of buys stands at 2.4m for @entity0 v @entity104 eight years ago			2
@entity104 's fight with @entity0 in 2007 holds the record for the most pay - per - view buys at 2.4m @entity1 was last in action when he dominated @entity110 over 12 rounds in @entity112 in november last year @entity0 's last fight came when he beat @entity114 in @entity43 in september 2014 naturally the charge has risen substantially since then , probably to $ 99.95 per subscription			1
thus @entity9 's five million buys – along with such ancillary income as tv rights overseas , including @entity120 - would make this ' the @entity121 '			1
that would generate $ 200m to be shared among the likes of the local broadcasting stations , the @entity76 hosts , the promoters , the undercard fighters and so on			0
as for the $ 300m to the two best pound - for - pound boxers in the world , @entity9 says : ' @entity0 loves cars and he could buy so many as to satisfy very dealer in @entity43			1
a lot of @entity1 's money is going to charity in the @entity136			0
' each to his own – and the @entity43 sports books are bracing themselves for seven - figure bets on @entity0 , the favourite , and @entity1 , the under - dog .			1

@entity0 and @entity1 will meet in @entity43 on may 2
the boxers have been expected to share a purse of $ 250m in a 60 - 40 split
but pay - per - view sales could add another $ 50m to the fight 's pot
promoter @entity9 believes there will be ' four to five million ' *ppv* buys
