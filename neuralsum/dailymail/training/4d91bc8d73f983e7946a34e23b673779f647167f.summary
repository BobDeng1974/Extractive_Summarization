the demise of @entity2 , it seems , has been greatly exaggerated once again			0
not for the first time in his career , the @entity5 striker 's longevity as a top level footballer had been questioned this summer in the wake of a difficult @entity10			2
this last week in @entity12 , however , @entity11 has shown his new manager @entity13 that he remains hungry , motivated and , most importantly , eminently capable of lifting this @entity5 team when he feels the need			1
not even a second half goal from his own half by @entity52 substitute @entity16 could upstage him			2
a terrific @entity11 goal – only made possible by perfect technique – from 25 yards and then an even better pass to @entity27 helped @entity5 in to a 2 - 0 lead			1
then , after a foul on @entity46 , @entity11 drilled the second penalty of his tour past the @entity52 goalkeeper in the 44th minute			1
given the heat in @entity96 on saturday , @entity11 was taken off at half - time as part of an almost total @entity5 reshuffle			1
@entity52 would only have been glad of that			0
certainly it was rather peculiar to see @entity5 in front by three at half - time as for half an hour they had been pretty dreadful			1
with @entity105 once again using the 3 - 5 - 2 formation he has promised will be the norm once the @entity109 season starts , @entity5 ’s central defenders were not on the same page at all as @entity111 played @entity62 in behind young @entity33 for a clear run on goal			1
the @entity52 midfielder looked as though he had scored as he lobbed the ball over young goalkeeper @entity116 but the ball took a huge bounce as it landed five yards from the goal line and somehow ended up clearing the crossbar			0
from range : @entity16 's strike from 60 yards stunned @entity5 goalkeeper @entity32 and the @entity21 crowd spot : @entity11 scored his second and @entity5 's third from the penalty spot as his side ran riot before the break @entity131 : @entity27 took the ball down from @entity11 and lobbed over @entity52 goalkeeper @entity53 relieved not to be behind so early , @entity5 tried to settle but their midfield kept giving the ball away which served only to invite further pressure on their uncertain defensive line			1
@entity111 may have done better than shoot at the goalkeeper after @entity41 – captain for the day – surrendered possession then @entity140 and @entity67 came close			2
@entity11 ’s first goal was lovely , though , and indicative of just what he can do when the mood takes him			2
receiving possession 25 yards from goal , the 28 - year - old shifted the ball to his right and whipped an unstoppable shot across his own body and in to the goalkeeper ’s right hand corner			0
come together : united players show unity after celebrating @entity11 's second goal it takes two : @entity11 is dispossesed by two @entity52 players in the first - half at @entity160 one of the goals of @entity11 ’s @entity5 career , it seemed to inspire him for just three minutes later he dropped in to his own half and , spotting @entity27 ’s run off a defender ’s shoulder , dropped a pass perfectly in to his path and watched as the @entity170 took possession and lifted the ball over the goalkeeper and in to the goal off the near post			1
@entity52 could have been excused a little disbelief			0
they had dominated the game but suddenly found themselves two behind			0
it soon got worse , too , as @entity46 and @entity24 exchanged passes only for @entity46 to be dragged down as he drove in to the penalty area			0
the contact from @entity52 ’s @entity69 may actually have been just outside the box but @entity11 did n’t care as he stepped up to drill the fourth goal of his tour past @entity53 from the penalty spot			2
up and down : @entity105 was pleased with the win but disappointed with the overall performance whipped : @entity40 , whose future is still unknown at @entity5 , attempts a cross-field ball in the second - half pressure : @entity192 closes down @entity5 and @entity193 striker @entity46 mine : @entity11 stretches in an attempt to get the ball from @entity69 as he had promised , @entity105 made nine changes at half - time			1
only @entity41 and @entity33 remained			0
@entity52 , meanwhile , introduced five new players including former @entity199 defender @entity59 at left - back			0
it was , however , a later substitute , the @entity202 midfielder @entity16 , who lifted the crowd to their feet with 15 minutes left , beating @entity32 from ten yards inside his own half with a perfect lob that @entity208 would have been proud of			1
@entity32 was to redeem himself rather with a late save from a @entity58 overhead kick but @entity68 reduced the deficit to one with a late penalty after @entity212 handled in the area .			0

@entity11 grabs first - half *double* as @entity5 score three goals in nine minutes
@entity27 scored superb lob in between @entity11 's strikes
@entity16 's 60 - yard wonder strike made it 3 - 1 with 15 minutes remaining
@entity223 made it *interesting* from the spot in the 88th minute
but @entity5 held on for their second *straight* tour win under @entity105
@entity41 started the match as captain for @entity105 's side in @entity21
