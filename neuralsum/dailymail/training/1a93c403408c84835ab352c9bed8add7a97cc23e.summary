the wealth of the average @entity2 household declined between 1983 and 2013 , according to a leading economist			1
@entity4 , an economics professor at @entity5 , said in a new study that in those 30 years the country 's net worth rose , but the average household saw a dip in wealth			1
writing in a paper entitled @entity13 in the @entity2 , 1962 - 2013 : what happened over the @entity15 ? , professor @entity4 claimed that @entity2 's worth rose partly because technology has improved and productivity has increases			1
the wealth of the average @entity2 household declined between 1983 and 2013 , according to a leading economist this means that society as a whole has become better and generating wealth			1
the issue , for many , is that this extra wealth has been funnelled into the top 20 per cent of the population , with the top one per cent finding themselves 82 per cent better off			1
however , the bottom 60 per cent has become poorer , @entity29 reported			0
@entity4 found that the median wealth figure for middle - income families - that means it 's been adjusted for inflation - for 1983 was $ 78,000 and the median wealth figure for 2013 was $ 63,800			1
however , these are 2013 prices - households in 1983 would , in fact , have had lower wealth in cash terms , but it would have enabled them to buy more than in 2013			1
it follows the announcement in december by the @entity41 that @entity2 ' net worth slipped in the july - september quarter , as shrinking stock portfolios overwhelmed a solid gain in home values			1
@entity2 household wealth declined 0.2 percent in the third quarter to $ 81.3 trillion , the @entity41 said			1
@entity2 ' stock and mutual fund portfolios shrank $ 700 billion			2
the value of their homes increased $ 245 billion			0
the slight drop comes after @entity2 ' wealth rose to a record in the april - june quarter			1
a booming stock market and a rebound in home values have enabled the nation 's net worth to rebound from the @entity15 and reach new highs			0
extra wealth has been funnelled into the top 20 per cent of the population , according to professor @entity4 yet other data shows that those gains have mostly benefited wealthier households , while leaving middle - class wealth largely unchanged			1
@entity4 calculates that the median household 's net worth was just $ 63,800 in 2013 , down from $ 64,600 in 2010			1
that decline came after a huge drop from 2007 to 2010 , when median net worth plummeted 44 percent from $ 115,100			0
the small decrease from 2010 to 2013 occurred despite big run - ups in stock and home prices over that period			2
so why have n't middle - class households benefited more ? @entity4 cites two factors			2
first , middle - income households rely much more than wealthier households on the value of their homes			0
houses accounts for nearly 63 percent of middle - class assets , @entity4 said in his paper			2
that compares to just nine per cent for the wealthiest one per cent			0
meanwhile , most stock market wealth is held by the top 10 per cent of households , which owns 80 per cent of stocks			2
only 9.5 percent of middle - class assets are in stocks			0
the second reason , @entity4 says , is that stagnating incomes likely forced many middle - income earners to sell assets and use the cash to cut their debt levels and maintain consumption			2
median household income slipped from $ 49,000 in 2010 to $ 46,700 three years later , according to @entity41 data			0
this trend can be seen in other data			0
middle - class households are now less likely to own homes , as their home ownership rate fell from 68 percent in 2010 to 66.7 percent three years later			0
retirement savings have suffered even more			0
the percentage who owned defined - contribution retirement accounts , such as 401 ( k ) s and @entity115 , fell from 53 percent in 2007 before the recession , to 44 percent in 2013			0
the dollar value of middle - class accounts dropped 16 percent during that period			0
' they were still depleting their assets because income remained very sluggish , ' @entity4 said .			2

@entity4 says wealth of average @entity2 household has declined
@entity127 has dropped between 1983 and 2013 , the @entity5 economist said
@entity2 overall is better off , but wealth has been funnelled into the top 20 *%*
