the glass case has been established at the @entity7 in the @entity9 capital @entity10 , where the schoolgirl will accept the world 's most famous peace prize tomorrow			1
it shows the blue tunic , white headscarf and white trousers , stained brown by dried blood , which the campaigning 15 - year - old wore on the day she was shot by the @entity20 on her school bus in @entity22			1
the pairing of the two prompted hopes that it would help unite @entity34 and @entity22 , who have been in conflict for decades			1
but it was @entity1 who dominated headlines due to her already global profile and her youth - becoming the youngest ever @entity45			1
already known as an activist and winner of @entity22 's @entity48 , she was on a school bus in october 2012 when it was stopped by a masked @entity20 gunman			1

difference : aged just 15 , an injured @entity1 is moved to an @entity61 hospital for treatment after the shooting museum : the uniform is the most high - profile piece in an exhibition about this year 's @entity69 laureates in @entity10 the bullet which hit @entity1 in the head went through her neck and lodged in the muscle above her shoulder blade			1
after the shooting she was moved to @entity79 for extensive surgery and , later , to build a new life , where she has continued campaigning for girls ' education			1
the exibition will last around two months , after which the uniform will be returned to the schoolgirl 's family			2

' @entity1 was honoured by the @entity69 committee for the ' struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to an education '			1
she brought the two friends who were injured alongside her to @entity10 so they could witness the @entity48 ceremony			2
@entity140 , now 16 , and @entity141 , now 17 , hugged their friend and posed for pictures with her today			0
the trio told reporters they were bound together in what they called ' @entity147 ' - joining with people around the world to make sure young girls have a chance to study			0

' if you are not educated , you ca n't do anything			0
' both remained in @entity22 immediately after the attack and continued attending school as they recovered , despite being under police guard			1
they are now studying at @entity168 near @entity169 , south @entity170 , and have said they want to become doctors			0
