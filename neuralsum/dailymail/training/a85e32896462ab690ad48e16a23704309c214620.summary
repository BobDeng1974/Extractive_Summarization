by @entity1 reporter a group of art collectors filed a lawsuit against the @entity6 foundation on friday , claiming it has cost them at least $ 40 million by publicly labeling about 90 paintings by the late artist as ' counterfeit ' and ' fake ' as it refuses to fully evaluate them			1
the lawsuit in @entity13 in @entity14 portrayed the @entity16 's approach to authentication as irrational and irresponsible , saying its authentication committee operated for many years ' in secret , with little or no explanation , and often without ever physically inspecting the works '			0
it said the foundation @entity6 started shortly before he died of @entity24 in 1990 disbanded the committee in 2012 to shield itself from litigation over its decisions but continued to obstruct the emergence of new @entity6 works through ' malicious and wrongful tactics ' , including shutting down the display of @entity32 art at a @entity33 show in march			1
the work of @entity6 is among the most iconic of the twentieth century			2
his catoonish paintings focused on 1980 's @entity39 street culture and often featured social messages @entity41 died of @entity24 in 1990			1
his art is worth between $ 500,000 to $ 1 million a piece several collectors filed a $ 40 million defamation lawsuit on friday against the foundation of late @entity39 painter @entity6 , which has publicly stated roughly 80 works owned by the dealers are fakes the foundation last year sued organizers of the ' @entity53 ' show , saying it was intended to defraud the public by exhibiting 200 purported works of art by @entity6 that were mostly fakes			1
the foundation said the paintings , mostly acrylic on canvas , would be worth about $ 40 million if they were authentic			2
' putting all these cheap @entity6 fakes into the market will depress the market and irreparably destroy the value of the authentic art and the reputation of the artist and the artwork , ' foundation lawyers wrote			1
in legal papers , they said a foundation director who visited the @entity33 show was ' shocked at the blatant fraud involved ' and saw only about eight authentic @entity6 works there			2
attorneys for the @entity6 foundation did not immediately comment on the @entity39 lawsuit			1
visitors walk past an untitled art creation by @entity6 during an exhibition retrospective in @entity79 in 2013 @entity6 , whose work focused on @entity39 's 1980s street culture , often with political or social messages , died in 1990			1
authenticated works by the artist can fetch between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million each @entity6 pictured here in 1985 nine art collectors maintained in their lawsuit friday that the foundation was motivated to restrict the discovery of new @entity92 art in part to boost the value of paintings already on the market , including some pieces that the foundation itself sold between 2008 and 2011 for $ 4.6 million , the lawsuit said			1
the lawsuit said a certificate of authenticity greatly increases the value of a piece of art , making it available for sale through major auction houses as well as through private buyers			0
the lawsuit was brought by collectors who it said began buying works in 2007 from two of @entity6 's friends			0
one of them was @entity6 's former lover , a dj who was introduced to @entity6 in 1982 and says the prolific artist gave him numerous pieces in the 1980s			0
the others were obtained from a graffiti artist , @entity123			0
@entity6 's artwork is among the most recognizable of the 20th century -- but the authenticity of roughly 90 paintings has been called into question pictures of the artwork , attached to the lawsuit as an exhibit , had titles such as ' @entity133 ' , ' @entity136 ' , ' @entity135 ' and ' @entity134 ' and were in @entity6 's cartoonish sketching style			2
because many buyers wanted paperwork certifying the art as authentic , @entity139 sometime after 1999 contacted the foundation , the lawsuit said			0
a representative initially expressed strong interest and asked for pictures and descriptions of the art , but the foundation eventually told him it would authenticate one or two of the pieces if he gave the foundation 10 pieces , according to the lawsuit			0
@entity139 again contacted the foundation in 2006 but was told that the foundation was not certifying artworks like the ones he wished to submit at that time and further conversations and inquiries ' proved fruitless ' , the lawsuit said .			0
