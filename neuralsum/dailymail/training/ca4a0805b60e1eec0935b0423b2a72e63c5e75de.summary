' she defended herself and hit you back , striking you on the nose , causing it to bleed			2
' perhaps because she had the temerity to fight back and bloody your nose , you armed yourself quite deliberately with a kitchen knife and you set about attacking @entity7 with that knife			1
' she tried to defend herself , warding off knife blows with her hand and in the process she sustained five wounds to the back of her left hand			1
' eventually you drove the blade into her right upper chest			0

mr @entity165 told jurors : ' it is a fact that the defendant unlawfully assaulted her on a number of occasions , sometimes using weapons			0

' the @entity178 on @entity32 upon @entity180 's @entity179 , where @entity41 was sentenced the court heard miss @entity7 had taken photographs of her own injuries from march 2011 until a week before her death			1

' @entity191 , defending , said @entity41 has summoned help immediately after the incident and showed ' regret ' straight away			0
following @entity41 ’s sentencing , @entity196 , @entity197 , said : ' my thoughts have been with @entity7 ’s family throughout this investigation , it has been a difficult ordeal and has had a devastating impact on them			2

she remains to this day , nine months on , in denial , in shock and in mourning			0
' she told me this week that she was " heartbroken " by @entity7 ’s death			2
it is of small comfort that our father @entity228 passed away quickly in 2003 , for there is no doubt that as an ex-policeman , witnessing this would have crushed him			0
' being in court in the past two weeks has been the most harrowing and horrific time of my life			0
' i thought i ’d be able to cope with hearing the evidence , that my disgust in @entity6 would somehow carry me through hearing about the circumstances of @entity7 ’s life in the @entity242 and of her death at his hands			1
' nothing could have prepared me or @entity247 , my wife , for hearing of the systematic and brutal way he controlled @entity7 , their jealous fights , his continued goading of her using @entity140 , their alcohol abuse and the violence he meted out " to shut her up "			2
' the verdict of murder is justice for @entity6			2
' the pain that his killing of my sister has left us with will remain always			0
' it is not lost on us the irony of the name " @entity41 " and this name will be a sickening reminder of what he has stolen from @entity7 , her future , her children , and her wider family and friends			2
