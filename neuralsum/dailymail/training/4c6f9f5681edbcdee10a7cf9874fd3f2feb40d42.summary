the @entity0 upped the ante friday on the terrorist @entity2 , declaring that the videotaped beheading of @entity5 photojournalist @entity4 is ' a terrorist attack ' – an admission that brought a stern ultimatum from a senior @entity9 in @entity10			1
' when you see somebody killed in such a horrific way , that represents a terrorist attack , ' deputy national security adviser @entity11 told reporters during a briefing on @entity19			1
' that represents a terrorist attack against our country and against an @entity5 citizen			2
' @entity26 rep. @entity25 , the @entity9 who chairs the powerful @entity28 , told @entity29 after the briefing that it 's time for president @entity32 to get serious about eradicating @entity2 – which half the @entity5 government refers to as @entity2 – instead of merely keeping the group at bay			1
' we need to build a coalition and use @entity5 military might			2
the administration has now acknowledged what many have long known : @entity2 is an undeniable threat to the peace and security of the @entity5			1
' ' we should not assume , however , that brutal groups like @entity2 fail on their own			2
they fail when stronger forces decide to take aggressive and prolonged action in response to their menacing actions			0
' ' the president should make clear , ' @entity25 concluded , ' that @entity2 will soon experience the full capabilities of @entity5 might			1
and i urge the president to develop a coherent strategy to defeat this enemy , and quickly authorize all necessary actions to do so			0
' the perception of slow - willed inaction is dogging the @entity0 , enabled by the @entity0 's insistence that @entity73 's turmoil will require a political solution – not a military one			1
a @entity77 spokesman hinted on friday that @entity5 's military involvement in @entity73 would n't be of the long - term shock - and - awe variety			1
' what we are doing in there is in support of @entity73 , ' rear admiral @entity80 told reporters during a press briefing			0
' and ultimately this is a fight that the @entity73 security forces have got to take on			0
' the answer to the @entity2 crisis , he said , ' is going to be found in good governance			2
' ' now i know that 's not – you know , that does n't offer everybody the immediacy that they might want to have with dealing with this threat , this very serious threat , ' @entity80 added			2
' but ultimately it 's defeating the ideology through good governance			0
it 's removing the unstable conditions , the petri dish , through which groups like this can foster and grow			0
' @entity11 seemed to go further a half - hour later			2
' if we see [ @entity2 ] lotting against @entity5 , [ if ] we see a threat to the @entity5 emanating from anywhere , we stand ready to take action against that threat , ' he said			1
the fast - flying contradictions between the @entity77 and the @entity0 are dizzying to some observers , particularly those who want to see a devastating @entity5 response to the vicious killing of @entity5 photojournalist @entity4			1
' @entity120 fiddles while @entity121 burns , ' insisted retired @entity123 lt. col. @entity122 during a @entity125 interview thursday night			0
' i think this president could care less about all the threats we face			1
' ' he 's probably gliding along on a path where he hopes nothing will happen to the @entity5 in the next two years while he 's still the president			1
but the reality is ... we face a threat unlike any threat we 've ever faced in our lives , and this administration seems to be doing nothing about it			0
' ' dropping some bombs here and there is nice , ' he snarked			0
' @entity120 fiddles while @entity121 burns , ' said retired @entity123 lt. col. @entity122 ; ' i think this president could care less about all the threats we face ' confusion : the @entity77 's chief spokesman said friday that the @entity5 military wants permission to ' train and equip ' @entity154 's rebel groups , at the same time the dictatorship is assuming greater importance as a potential ally in the fight against @entity2 as @entity2 continued to conquer and hold territory , @entity5 military strategists are sharpening their focus on the portion of the group 's fighters who remain on the @entity154 side of a largely invisible border with @entity73			1
launching a decisive attack on the group in northern @entity73 , they fear , will only serve to isolate @entity2 in @entity154 , where dictator @entity170 's regime would likely keep them out of @entity5 's reach			1
for that reason , the @entity77 has begun to talk openly about the need to neutralize @entity170 in order to take him out of the equation , leaving the @entity5 free to finish the job with @entity2			1
' we do not have the authorities now to begin a train - and - equip program with the moderate @entity154 opposition , ' @entity80 explained friday , referring to the hodgepodge of @entity182 and less ideological factions who have opposed the @entity154 strongman since the spring of 2011			1
' we want to have those authorities and we want to have the resources that go with it , ' he said			0
' we 're still working on that right now , ' he added			0
the @entity5 has not – officially , at least – provided arms to those groups since many in @entity10 have fretted about the possibility of military materiel ultimately aiding terrorist organizations			1
@entity5 arms and armored vehicles have already fallen into @entity2 's hands as the group seizes hardware originally gifted to the @entity73 army			1
amid the cacophony , another approach to @entity170 has emerged : some are now arguing that @entity5 should let bygones be bygones and ask him for permission to conduct @entity208 airstrikes in his country			1
general @entity210 , the former chief of general staff of the @entity212 's army , said during a radio interview friday that ' the @entity154 dimension has got to be addressed			2
you can not deal with half a problem			0
' ' the old saying " my enemy 's enemy is my friend " has begun to have some resonance with our relationship with @entity224 , ' he said			0
' i think it 's going to have to have some resonance with our relationship with @entity170			2
' ' whether it is above the counter or below the counter , a conversation has got to be held with him			0
because if there are going to be any question of air strikes over @entity154 airspace it 's got to be with the @entity170 regime 's approval			1
' ' the enemy of our enemy is our friend ' : @entity245 wants to ' rehabilitate ' @entity170 so the dictator can help the @entity5 defeat @entity2 in @entity154 general @entity210 , the former chief of general staff of the @entity212 's army , said during a radio interview that the @entity250 should soften on working with @entity170 the way it has soften previously in @entity73 @entity212 foreign secretary @entity253 retorted almost immediately that @entity212 wo n't ' align ' with @entity170 to defeat @entity2			1
his country may have a ' common enemy ' with the @entity154 regime , @entity253 said , but ' that does n't make us friends			2
it does n't make us able to trust them , it does n't enable use to work with them			0
' television commentator @entity245 told @entity266 audience friday morning that while he wants ' to see a declaration of war against @entity2 , ' the @entity5 should aim for ' the rehabilitation of the @entity154 dictator @entity170 and his @entity270 forces who have successfully kept them at bay			1
' ' the enemy of our enemy is our friend , ' @entity245 said , echoing @entity210			0
' i want us to rehabilitate the dictator in @entity278			0
i think he can be forced to make his own government more inclusive , head to some kind of settlement of the @entity154 civil war and the @entity154 army , a fine army , [ and ] join with @entity5 air power and our @entity73 allies			1
' all must make common cause against this dreadful threat to civilization , ' he said of the terror group			0
during the @entity77 briefing , @entity80 left the door open for @entity5 attacks against @entity2 on @entity154 soil , reacting to questions about remarks secretary of defense @entity299 made a day earlier			1
@entity154 rebels continue to be a thorn in @entity170 's side , but will the @entity5 arm them or make common cause with @entity170 against @entity2 ? ' the secretary did n't rule anything in or out , ' @entity80 said			1
' we have n't made any decisions with regard to @entity154			2
... i 'm not going to speak about operations that we 're not conducting			0
' he acknowledged that @entity2 poses and ' imminent threat ' and has ' grown in capability , with speed , helped along by resourcing from some of their own criminal activity , as well as donations and ransoms			0
... we 've all been watching this			0
' but his emphasis remained on @entity5 ' support ' missions intended to ease the tasks in front of @entity73 and @entity330 forces , on international coalition - building , and on hopes for an ' inclusive ' @entity334 government that would no longer alienate @entity73 's @entity336 minority			2
with a hat - tip toward other nations that have taken part in missions to date , he added that ' we have been encouraged by the assistance of international partners like the @entity212			0
' ' and i also want to take the opportunity today to thank @entity345			0
@entity345 has now come forward and offered to conduct resupply missions with @entity330 forces , which again we 're very grateful for			0
' the @entity350 administration was universally mocked in 2003 when it boasted that @entity351 had joined the the @entity212 and @entity352 as the only nations offering military support duringand after the @entity5 invasion			2
other nations like the @entity357 and @entity358 , which do n't have standing armies , were also singled out for praise by the @entity361 .			0

deputy national security adviser @entity11 warned @entity2 that ' if you come after @entity5 , we ’re going to come after you wherever you are '
@entity28 chair @entity25 told @entity29 that @entity32 should warn @entity2 that it will feel ' the full capabilities of @entity5 might '
a retired @entity370 lieutenant *colonel* *charged* that ' this president could care less about all the threats we face '
earlier , a @entity77 spokesman said @entity77 is working on ' getting permission for ' train and equip ' rebels to help *overthrow* @entity170
but a defense spokesman also said military *leaders* have not ruled out attacking @entity2 in @entity154 – a move that would require @entity170 's permission
