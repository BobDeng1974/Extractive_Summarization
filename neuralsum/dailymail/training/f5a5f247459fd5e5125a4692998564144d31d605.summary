by @entity0 @entity1 is used to having passers - by stop him on the street in ' little puddles of sentiment ' commenting on how cute his ' puppy is ' , to which he replies , ' @entity8 is not a puppy , he is three years old			1
' almost approaching his fourth birthday , @entity8 , is one of the rare @entity14 shepherd 's with @entity15 , a rare genetic disorder found in dogs when both parents carry the dwarf gene			1
expert in @entity22 breeding , @entity23 , says the mutation is currently found in only 12 per cent of @entity22 's world wide			1
@entity8 , who is nearly four years old , is a rare @entity14 shepherd with @entity15 she says breeders should take the mutation seriously and test their studs for the gene			1
' it 's not cute - from my point of view it 's quite distressing and very serious , ' ms @entity23 told the @entity37			0
' they are suffering from a genetic mutation and suffer serious health problems			2
' pituitary dwarfism syndrome in dogs occurs when puppies are born without a pituitary gland and unable to produce the correct amounts of growth and thyroid hormone			1
as a result of this mutation , puppies stop growing at an early age and face many health issues such as , shortened life span and problems with growing skin , teeth and adult fur			2
dogs like @entity8 , here with owner @entity1 , stop growing at an early age and face many health issues the temperament of dwarfed dogs are typically aggressive and anxious , which make for undesirable pets , resulting in breeders usually being forced to euthanize a puppy born with dwarfism			1
@entity8 's owner @entity1 told the @entity37 that to euthanize was never an option			1
eight years ago mr @entity1 and his partner @entity70 had purchased a full grown @entity22 from breeders @entity71 and @entity73			1
it was n't until five years later when mr @entity1 received a call from the @entity76 , telling him of their recent breed of genetically mutated @entity14 shepherds and asking him if he would be willing to adopt a mutated dog with dwarfism			1
' we did a pretty good job with our full grown dog , @entity85 , so they [ @entity76 ] thought we would be the best people to take on @entity8 , ' he said			0
the temperament of dwarfed dogs are typically aggressive and anxious resulting in breeders usually being forced to euthanize a puppy born with dwarfism ' the first thing we got from the breeders was a photo of him , ' he said			2
' a tiny little thing - it was too cute ! ' ' i did n't want something that ridiculously cute but my reaction was " well what harm could it bring ? " ' typically @entity14 shepherds with dwarfism are n't genetically blessed with the same level of cuteness @entity8 possesses			1
' we actually won the lottery when it came to dwarfism , ' mr @entity1 admitted			2
' @entity73 and @entity71 specially chose for us the one who was the least obviously affected but we were prepared to have a pretty ugly , little dog			0
' @entity1 said the @entity76 were completely upfront and forthcoming with the challenges they would face having a dog with dwarfism			0
typically @entity14 shepherds with dwarfism are n't genetically blessed with the same level of cuteness @entity8 possesses , seen here with the @entity1 's other dog @entity85 ' we got him young enough that he could still bond with the people who matter and our big dog has a good nature so he [ @entity8 ] never got hostile ' , he said			1
' he was n't over whelmed because there were n't too many of us			0
' @entity1 attempted taking @entity8 to @entity119 , and without surprise , he failed to behave in a social setting , trying to attack the dogs and humans around			2
it was n't until six months of having @entity8 , when @entity1 and @entity70 noticed his temperament changing from timid to full time aggression			1
' he became even more aggressive , ' he said			0
' he is timid around everything , always jumpy and very nervous			0
when people come over we usually have to put a muzzle on him			0
@entity8 ( left with @entity1 ) was bred by @entity71 and @entity73 ( centre and right ) has two brothers @entity131 and @entity135 who also has @entity15 , and a sister @entity136 ( right ) ' you think he is full of confidence but in fact it is quite the opposite - his reaction to everything around him is to frighten it away			1
' but behind closed doors and in the comfort of his home , @entity8 shows his owners a more softer side			0
' he is a lovely , affectionate playful little thing while he is at home with us			0
' when asked by the @entity37 on the thought of losing their beloved @entity8 , @entity1 admits to a being conflicted			2
' we ca n't put him into kennels or be dog - sitted because he is so aggressive so we ca n't take holidays away and he is quite a burden as far as having visitors goes			0
' but about 18 months ago @entity8 suffered from an unexplained infection which caused him being rushed to hospital			0
' my partner was in tears at the thought of losing him , ' he said			0
' we are very attached to him - we will miss him dreadfully but there will also be a sense of freedom being able to resume a normal life			0
' @entity1 said they ca n't get anyone to look after @entity8 and have trouble when they have visitor as he is too aggressive			2
