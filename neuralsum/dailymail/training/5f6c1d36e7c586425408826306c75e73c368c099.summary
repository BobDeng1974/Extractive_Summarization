and there is nothing wrong with that			0
unfortunately , this sometimes gets in the way of providing the very best nutritional information for their customers ' health			0
' for example , their serving suggestions on the front of their products and on the product 's nutritional back label are often not the norm for their shoppers : half a pizza , quarter of pork pie , half tin of baked beans , four squares of chocolate ... it would certainly be helpful and healthier for their customers if they also provided nutritional information for the whole product not an unrealistic portion size			0
' the encouragement of over-buying and over-eating has gone on for far too long , no wonder obesity , diabetes and heart disease are all on the increase .			0
