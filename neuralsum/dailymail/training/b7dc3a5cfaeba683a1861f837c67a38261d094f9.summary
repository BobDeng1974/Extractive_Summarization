by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 2:34 pm on 8th december 2011 football fans in @entity3 may have been downcast last night , but there were a number of tv executives who would have been jumping for joy			0
@entity9 and @entity10 's elimination from the @entity11 means they have been exiled to the lesser - watched tv backwaters of @entity13 and @entity14			1
they , along with @entity16 , have the rights to the @entity18 , the competition in which the @entity21 's top two teams will now be competing			1
and executives at the channels will be now be looking froward to a boost in viewers of their thursday night football coverage of @entity28 's second - tier competition			1
@entity30 's defeat in the @entity18 final in 2010 was watched by 4.715million viewers on @entity13 ; the @entity14 audience for @entity9 's @entity11 final appearance this may peaked at 11million			1
out : last year 's runners - up @entity9 will play in the @entity18 not this year : @entity10 's first year in the @entity11 ended at the group stages @entity9 fans were not amused as @entity13 posted a message on @entity38 welcoming their team to the @entity18 within minutes of the final whistle last night			1
the @entity13 press office tweeted : ' a warm welcome to @entity9 to the @entity44 team ... Â£ europaleague ' at 10pm as @entity46 fans were still coming to terms with the humiliation of being dumped out of the @entity11			2
but the tweet did not go down well with @entity9 fans			2
one fan wrote on @entity38 : ' @entity52 trying to take the p * * * ? ' while another supporter , @entity55 , added : ' sarcastic f * * * * * * * t * * * * * ' and @entity58 wrote : ' worst tweet ever '			0
other @entity9 fans suggested that they would not be tuning in to see the coverage			2
one wrote : ' we 're still not going to watch your crap channel ! ! ' and @entity65 added : ' as if we need another reason to avoid ch5 '			0
@entity13 has enjoyed some of its biggest - ever ratings for @entity18 matches , with audiences of over 2 million viewers for some games			1
it will also be good news for football fans who do n't have @entity74 , which has near - exclusive rights to the elite competition , as they will now be able to follow closely follow the two clubs ' @entity78 fortunes			1
however , the prospect is not one the players are as willing to embrace			0
@entity9 defender @entity82 said : ' it 's embarrassing to be in the @entity18			1
' @entity82 added : ' i 'm not ready for it and the way i feel now it 's @entity11 or nothing			0
it feels like a dream			0
i feel i 'll wake up tomorrow and we will have qualified			0
' but it 's not a dream , it 's the reality and we should have woken up earlier			0
we have n't been professional from the beginning of this competition			0
' sir @entity97 's team suffered a shock 2 - 1 defeat in @entity100 , meaning @entity9 , last year 's beaten finalists , failed to progress to the knockout stages of the competition for the first time since 2005 - 06 season			1
and despite a convincing 2 - 0 win at home to @entity108 , @entity10 went out as they needed to better @entity110 's result - but the @entity111 won by the same scoreline in @entity113			2
@entity9 only needed to avoid defeat but @entity115 and @entity116 gave @entity117 a two - goal advantage before @entity119 got one back late on			2
' it 's a loss because it 's the best tournament in the world , ' added @entity97 after seeing @entity9 finish third in what was regarded as the easiest group			1
' the @entity18 is a competition i 've never been in with @entity9			2
it means playing on thursday and sunday right through and that has to be dealt with			0
that 's our penalty for not qualifying			0
you have to deal with disappointment			0
it 's been used as a motivation many times			0
' dejection : both sir @entity97 and @entity137 come to terms of being knocked out of the @entity11 at the group stages @entity10 boss @entity137 also struggled to contain his bitter disappointment after crashing out of the @entity11			1
he said : ' i think that maybe now the @entity18 will feel like it 's not a very important trophy , certainly not as much as the @entity11			2
' be he added : ' for @entity10 , it can be important , because we need to win trophies			0
if we can reach the final , then you can be sure it will mean a lot to everyone			0
' we must give it our best shot , but at the moment , i am very disappointed , because i really wanted us to go through tonight			0
' there was , however , some good news for @entity156 - and @entity158 fans - today after he was cleared to play in @entity158 's final group game at @entity160			1
@entity156 had been facing the prospect of three games out after receiving a straight red card for kicking @entity164 in @entity158 's final qualifier in october			1
but @entity28 this morning reduced the striker 's ban to two games , meaning the @entity9 forward will miss the tournament opener against @entity171 and the clash with @entity173 but can return to @entity175 's side against @entity176			1
the 26 - year - old has also agreed to do some coaching in the community , said the @entity181 's hearing for his appeal against an international ban began			2
@entity156 and @entity158 coach @entity175 were at the @entity28 headquarters in @entity185 , @entity100 for the appeal hearing @entity156 stops to give a fan an autograph as he arrives at the @entity28 headquarters in @entity100 for his appeal hearing against a three - match ban @entity156 and @entity158 coach @entity175 at the hearing which began just 10 hours after his club was eliminated from the @entity11			1

sir @entity97 *unhappy* at the prospect of competing in @entity28 's second - tier competition
@entity9 and @entity10 's @entity18 games will be on @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16
some good news for @entity156 as three - match ban is cut to two , clearing him to play in @entity158 's final group game at @entity160
