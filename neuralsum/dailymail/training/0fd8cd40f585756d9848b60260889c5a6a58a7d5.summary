by @entity0 published : 19:12 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 21 november 2013 anger : chief secretary to the @entity3 said there was no ' sense ' behind the figures @entity7 receives more than £ 1,600 extra per head than the @entity9 , exposing the massive benefits they enjoy by being part of the @entity13			1
new national statistics published yesterday showed the glaring disparities of public spending ahead of next year ’s independence referendum			1
@entity9 is short - changed to the tune of three per cent a year per person , while @entity7 gets 16 per cent more spent on it than the @entity22 average			1
@entity23 gets a massive 24 per cent extra spent on it proportionately and @entity25 10 per cent compared to the @entity22 average			1
every @entity7 gets £ 10,152 spent on them , compared to £ 8,529 for the @entity9 , £ 9,709 for the @entity25 and £ 10,876 for those living in @entity23			1
the @entity22 average spend per head is £ 8,788 - £ 1,364 more than the @entity7			2
those in living in the @entity31 of @entity9 lose out the most			2
they get just £ 7,638 per head of public spending			1
@entity36 , in contrast , have a healthy £ 9,435 splurged on them which the @entity38 put down to the higher infrastructure and wage costs			2
a breakdown of the different policy areas show that @entity7 enjoy £ 307 per head spent on housing , while the @entity9 get just £ 138			1
@entity7 also get more than twice as much spent on them than the @entity9 on economic development : £ 992 per head compared to £ 469			1
spending on health is £ 1,912 per person in @entity9 compared to £ 2,115 in @entity7 , where prescriptions are free			1
education is another area where @entity7 get more resources - as well as not paying university tuition fees			2
some £ 1,441 is spent per head on education in @entity7 compared to £ 1,360 in @entity9			1
@entity7 , who enjoy free personal care , have £ 1,857 spent on them for social care and pensions , compared to £ 1,652 for the @entity9			1
the figures were seized on by @entity22 ministers who argued that they showed the advantage @entity7 gets from being part of the @entity13			2
chief secretary to the treasury , @entity3 , said : ‘ these figures demonstrate that the people of @entity7 continue to see a real financial benefit of over £ 1,300 per person compared to the @entity22 average			2
the @entity22 remains the most successful economic , and political , union in history and @entity7 is one of its greatest success stories			0
it makes no sense to put this at risk through separation			0
’ the generous funding package stems from the controversial @entity80 formula , which was based on population , rather than need			0
however council bosses in @entity9 and @entity25 this week called for the ‘ unfair competitive advantage ’ handed to @entity7 to be scrapped			2
scaremongering : the @entity85 said @entity7 per head paid more tax - if @entity89 revenue is counted the @entity90 said the @entity91 should dump the 34 year - old @entity92			1
but the @entity85 accused the @entity22 of scaremongering and not taking into account that @entity7 per head paid more tax - if @entity89 revenue is counted			2
@entity95 , the @entity96 said : ‘ @entity97 is an independent @entity7 in charge of own abundant resources , and a relationship of equality with the rest of the @entity22			0
‘ a no vote would be the worst of all worlds because it would be a green light for the @entity38 to slash @entity7 ’s budget and the services we all depend on			0
‘ she added that politicians south of the border were ‘ itching to impose even harsher spending cuts in @entity7 ’			0
a spokesman for @entity115 campaign better together said : ‘ these figures underline the fact that we have the best of both worlds here in @entity7			0
‘ we have a @entity7 parliament making decisions about our health , our education and our police , and we have the strength and security of being part of the @entity22			0
@entity130 would end it and would be a huge leap into the unknown			0
’ the @entity132 will next week release its white paper on what an independent @entity7 would be like , should @entity7 vote to break away from the @entity22 in next september ’s referendum			0
future : the @entity132 will next week release its white paper on what an independent @entity7 would be like but @entity7 ’s advocate general , lord @entity138 will say in a speech today fri that the ‘ real challenge to the @entity132 [ is ] to what extend will the white paper own up to the uncertainties which would inevitably flow from a ‘ yes ’ vote in a referendum ’			0
@entity7 ’s membership of @entity147 and the @entity13 would have to be renegotiated and @entity7 may even be deprived of using the pound as its main currency			0
switching to a ‘ needs - based ’ formula would give @entity9 more than £ 4 billion extra a year to spend , the @entity90 said			1
that would amount to around £ 94 more per head for the @entity9 , £ 103 more for the @entity25 , while @entity7 would be stripped of £ 846 and @entity23 would lose £ 516 per person			1
the first minister of wales this week also signalled he would veto the so - called sterling zone if @entity7 voted for independence			0
in an article for the @entity7 @entity160 , @entity158 wrote : ‘ it is highly unlikely that currency union without strong fiscal controls could work , there would be too much uncertainty , it would slow down decision making and the risk to @entity25 and @entity23 would be far greater - so it would only be right for the views of the rest of the @entity22 to be heard			0
‘ given the experience of the @entity170 in recent years , and the uncertainty which surrounded the various bail - outs , then i am not convinced that a shared currency would work from the @entity25 perspective			0

national statistics showed the glaring disparities of public spending
scots get £ 10,152 spent on them , compared to £ 8,529 for the @entity9
the @entity90 said the 34 year - old @entity92 should be dropped
