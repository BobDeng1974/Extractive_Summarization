by @entity0 it 's a @entity2 summer tradition , famous for its beautiful blooms and the occasional wacky garden design			0
now the @entity5 , which opens next week , has gone high fashion after @entity7 unveiled its whimsical garden inspired by its classic @entity10 motif			1
the @entity11 is designed by @entity12 and includes many of the varieties immortalised in the print , which made its debut in 1966 on a silk scarf			1
glamorous : @entity7 's @entity5 garden was inspired by its classic @entity10 print , designed in 1966 commissioned by @entity7 , one of @entity7 founder @entity23 ’s four sons , the @entity10 design has royal , as well as botanical connotations			1
in need of a suitable gift for princess @entity29 , @entity26 commissioned artist @entity30 to create a floral pattern for an silk scarf , which he then presented to the royal instead of a bouquet			1
@entity30 's design , which was completed in time for a visit to the @entity7 boutique in @entity38 by the @entity40 princess , eventually included a riot of naturalistic flowers , fruit and insects and was dedicated to the four seasons			2
' when i first joined @entity7 , i immediately asked to see the archive , and it was there that i rediscovered the @entity10 pattern , ' remembers creative director , @entity49			2
inspiration : the @entity10 print was created for princess @entity29 who visited the brand 's @entity38 boutique pretty : the gorgeous @entity10 print has been revived for a new version of the £ 1 , 480 @entity58 bag ' i remember chic women – my mother and grandmother among them – wearing @entity10 scarves in the 70s , and i ’ve always been fascinated by the story behind the design and how it was created for @entity66			1
although the silk scarves are no longer available , @entity7 has launched a new version of its iconic @entity58 bag featuring the canvas print			1
first introduced in 1947 , the bag , which starts at £ 1,480 , is made from canvas emblazoned with the flora print and includes the trademark bamboo cane handle specially made for the fashion house by artisan craftsmen in @entity77			0
almost there : the @entity5 opens on the 20th may and runs until the 24th hotly anticipated : tickets have sold faster than ever this year , although @entity80 wo n't be there ' @entity10 was the very first iconic design motif from @entity7 ’s past that i decided to revive and reinterpret , ' adds @entity49			2
' since then i have used it on bags , dresses , scarves ( of course ) and as the inspiration for a series of fragrances			0
' i am so excited by the prospect of finally seeing @entity10 as a real garden at the @entity5 ; there is something truly magical about this project			0
' the @entity5 opens on the 20th may and runs until the 24th			0
