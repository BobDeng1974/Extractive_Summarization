@entity2 's hopes of a @entity4 majority will evaporate if @entity5 leaves the @entity6 , new analysis reveals today			1
@entity4 is on course to win the 2015 election with a majority of 32 seats in the @entity11 , according according to a poll - but only because of @entity5 mps who will be given the boot in the event of independence			1
now ministers have been called on to explain how they would respond if @entity5 votes for independence , as @entity6 is faced with a constitutional crisis at the next election			0
the poll was compiled by @entity36 , professor of politics at @entity38 , for the @entity39			0
he said @entity5 could be critical to @entity4 ’s ability to win an overall majority			2
in may 2010 @entity4 won 41 seats in @entity5 , the @entity43 11 , the @entity44 six while the @entity45 secured just one mp			2
if the latest opinion polls are repeated at the general election on may 7 , 2015 , @entity4 could win another five seats north of the border			1
currently , @entity5 voters are expected to be able to take part next may , meaning @entity4 could win a majority thanks to its dominance of @entity5 constituencies			1
by contrast , the @entity56 have only one @entity5 mp			0
but if the country votes for independence , all @entity5 mps would be swept away in march 2016 , when @entity5 would become an independent nation			1
there have been calls for @entity5 voters to be excluded from the general election if they decided to vote yes for independence in next week 's referendum			1
some mps have also suggested they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote			0
it would be the first time since 1940 , a year into the second world war , that a general election would have been postponed			2
if the country votes for independence , all @entity5 mps would be swept away in march 2016 , when @entity5 would become an independent nation the option has not yet been discussed with ministers , @entity80 sources say , but one official told the paper : ' it is too sensitive before the referendum , but we could n’t duck it any longer if there were a @entity91 vote			1
' former @entity4 mp @entity92 , now an independent , said the election would ‘ surely be cancelled ’ , adding : ‘ an @entity94 parliamentary election would be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border			0
‘ there could meanwhile be no question that , for example , @entity4 might win a @entity6 election by a small majority , only to see a @entity45 government and prime minister take power in @entity94 without an election once the @entity5 had departed			1
' moreover , the notion of @entity5 mps voting on @entity94 - only matters while the whole parliament was consumed by @entity5 extracting themselves from the union would be nonsensical and unmanageable			2
’ @entity112 , @entity44 leader at @entity113 , called last year for a delay in the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place			0
@entity119 and @entity2 today urged people across @entity6 to fly the @entity121 to convince voters in @entity5 to reject independence , but workers struggled to raise the flag in @entity126 but the @entity128 constitution select committee raised doubts about a delay , saying : ‘ the extension of a parliament beyond five years ... may risk being seen by voters as self - serving , extending the time in power of the current government			2
’ it comes as @entity119 , @entity2 and @entity138 will travel to @entity5 today to plead with voters to stay in the @entity6			0
the three @entity113 party leaders released a joint statement declaring that it was time to go to @entity5 to bolster the faltering ' @entity145 ' campaign and ordered the @entity5 flag to be raised over @entity126			0
the desperate last - ditch move to convince voters to reject independence comes amid alarming polls showing a surge in support for independence .			0

if @entity5 mps are *included* , @entity4 expected to win with majority of 32
if not , @entity4 will be three seats short and there *'ll* be hung @entity160
