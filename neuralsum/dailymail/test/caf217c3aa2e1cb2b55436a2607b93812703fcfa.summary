‘ i think this myth that they ’re for women is only a myth and the reality is the campaign they have run against me shows what they truly think about women			0
’ miss @entity1 , who was one of only five ministers to make it onto the front page of the conservative manifesto alongside mr @entity49 , hit back at suggestions she was only there as a ‘ token woman ’			1

i call on the @entity18 leadership locally and nationally to reign it in because it is not the sort of civilised debate we should be having			2
