' @entity0 ' is a confident message to have on your boots going into a @entity5 final ... but it seemed to work for @entity6			1

inscribed on his boots was the intriguing message , as @entity6 mixed a little bit of confidence and a little bit of arrogance			2
heard of the chosen one before this season ? a much - maligned banner was displayed at @entity46 for the majority of the year , signalling sir @entity38 's decision to have @entity39 succeed him at @entity49			0
that ploy did n't go quite to plan , but @entity6 will have been happy it did n't come back to haunt him in the climax to the tournament the @entity55 dressing room sported many unusual kit choices , varying from ancient shinpads , to a vast selection of boots			0
heartfelt : @entity60 has his son 's date of birth scribed on his boots wide array of choices : the @entity10 strikers wo n't be short of boots for the big game ... video @entity71 fans take to the beach in celebration			0
