a news report on thursday that revealed secret communications between president @entity2 and @entity5 ’s @entity4 ayatollah @entity3 has a top @entity7 lawmaker accusing @entity2 of playing ' footsie ' with the ' enemy ' just as the deadline for a nuclear deal with the country approaches			1
according to the @entity13 , @entity2 sent @entity3 a letter last month assuring him that airstrikes about @entity16 in the country were not intended to undermine @entity5 ally and @entity19 president @entity18			1
the letter allegedly indicated that the @entity21 may be willing to work with @entity5 in the fight against radical @entity24 militants ravaging the region if it satisfied a nov. 24 deadline to come to an agreement with negotiators about its nuclear program			1
the @entity50 spokesman refused on thursday to comment on the report , stating that he is ' not in a position to discuss private correspondence between the president and any world leader			0
' however , ' i can tell you that the policy that the president and his administration have articulated about @entity5 remains unchanged , ' he told reporters			2
' the @entity21 will not cooperate militarily with @entity5 [ in the campaign against @entity16			1
] we wo n't share intelligence with them , ' he said			0
' but their interests in this outcome is something that 's been widely commented upon and something on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations , ' he noted			0
national security advisor @entity76 also refused to confirm the letter to reporters on friday nor did she deny that it was sent			0
as i have said ' repeatedly in public , ' as have other administration officials , ' we are in no way ' engaged ' in any military coordination ' with @entity5 as it regards to @entity16 , she said , using an alternative name for @entity16			1
@entity85 said the @entity21 takes eliminating the threat from @entity16 seriously , ' but we are not doing so in coordination with the government of @entity5			1
' she also asserted that ' there is no linkage ' between the administration 's military actions against @entity16 and the @entity5 nuclear plan			1
@entity7 sen. @entity31 of @entity32 , a constant critic of the @entity2 administration 's foreign policy , had blasted the president on thursday for putting rebels of the @entity19 government being trained by the @entity21 to fight @entity16 in harm 's way by promising @entity5 that @entity18 is not under siege			1
' now it is really an immoral situation , and i do n’t use that word lightly , ' @entity31 , the ranking member of the @entity105 's committee on @entity106 , told @entity111 on thursday			1
' they are now going to train @entity19 to go in and fight against @entity16 and at the same time allowing @entity18 to slaughter them with barrel bombs and air attacks and other attacks , ' he contended			2
' every time we strike @entity16 , then @entity18 steps up his attacks on the @entity120			0
' continuing , @entity31 said , ' as i say , it ’s immoral , yet somehow we are playing footsie with the @entity5 and hope they will somehow have an effect on @entity16			1
' president @entity2 , right , talks to secretary of health and human services @entity125 before the start of a @entity128 in the @entity129 at the @entity50 on friday			1
@entity2 will meet next with @entity7 leaders , who will undoubtedly chastize him over the letter to @entity5 in a joint statement with fellow @entity134 member and close @entity105 ally @entity136 of @entity137 , @entity31 called @entity2 's overtures to @entity5 ' outrageous			1
' ' this is the same @entity5 regime that has been complicit in the rise of @entity16 by pushing a violent sectarian agenda throughout the @entity46 -- backing radical @entity145 militias and politicians in @entity147 , doing everything in its power to aid the killing machine of @entity18 in @entity19 , arming @entity152 terrorists with advanced rockets in @entity154 , and orchestrating @entity156 's dispatch of thousands of fighters from @entity158 into @entity19 , ' the @entity7 duo said			1
@entity5 , they said , ' cares more about trying to weaken @entity21 and push us out of the @entity46 than cooperating with us			1
' going down this path will ' harm @entity21 national security interests , as well as our relationships with our closest regional allies and partners , in pursuit of the illusory goal of rapprochement with the current @entity5 leadership , ' they argued			2
' the consequences of this ill - conceived bargain would destroy the @entity19 ' last best chance to live in freedom from the brutal @entity18 regime			0
' house speaker @entity177 also expressed skepticism that any good would come of @entity2 's outreach to @entity3			2
' i do n’t trust the @entity5 , i do n’t think we need to bring them into this , ' @entity177 said on thursday			0
' i would hope that the negotiations that are under way are serious negotiations , but i have my doubts , ' the @entity7 leader , who is scheduled to meet with @entity2 about a number of issues this afternoon , said			2
outgoing @entity7 legislator and current @entity192 chairman @entity191 told @entity111 on friday that @entity2 's letter was unhelpful to the overall @entity21 strategy in the region			1
' i can tell you that it is causing real problems with our @entity200 partners in the fight against @entity16 , ' @entity191 said , according to @entity203			2
' it ’s really concerning			0
' the @entity206 congressman suggested that @entity5 may have leaked the letter to gain the upper hand in negotiations			2
' just because the enemy of your enemy sometimes wants to help you , that does n’t mean they ’re still not your adversary , ' he said			0
putting it bluntly , a senior congressional source who spoke to @entity217 , said of @entity2 's back channeling with @entity5 : ' this f * * * s up everything			2
' from left - right at the @entity2 cabinet meeting are secretary of education @entity224 , secretary of health and human services @entity125 , @entity2 , secretary of defense @entity227 , and secretary of commerce @entity229			0
@entity2 gave brief remarks before the meeting to reporters before reporters were ushered out the clock on @entity2 's efforts to talk @entity5 into signing the nuclear deal is ticking as republicans , who favor greater sanctions on the country , are now slated to take control of both chambers of the legislative branch in the new year			1
bipartisan legislation sponsored by @entity245 of @entity246 , a @entity7 , and @entity247 of @entity248 , a @entity249 , could go into effect as soon as january			0
' the best way to prevent @entity5 from getting a nuclear weapon is to quickly pass the bipartisan @entity254 legislation — not to give the @entity5 more time to build a bomb , ' @entity245 said wednesday , per the @entity13			0
on thursday @entity31 said that the @entity21 has ' already given away the store by allowing them the right to enrich and not putting in check both the development of warheads and the means to deliver them			2
' @entity31 said any efforts by the president to build a better relationship with the country that is ' spreading disorder and unrest throughout the region ' is misguided			0
' they are not our friend			0
are we are treating them as somebody that we can continue to do business with , ' he said			0
' this is a foreign policy that is off the rails			0
' @entity285 rep. @entity284 came to his party leader 's defense on friday , saying the letter was ' not outrageous ' as @entity31 and @entity136 had stated			0
' presidents use backchannels all the time , ' he told @entity291			0
' look , you do n’t have to trust @entity5 to understand that the @entity21 and @entity5 do have a common interest in trying to defeat @entity16 and i thought sen. @entity31 and sen. @entity136 wanted to do everything possible to defeat @entity16 , ' he said , goading the @entity7 senators .			1
