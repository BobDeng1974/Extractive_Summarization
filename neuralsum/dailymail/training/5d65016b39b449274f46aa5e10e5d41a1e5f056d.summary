@entity1 ceo @entity0 apologized on thursday night and said he was wrong for saying that women do n't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well			1
@entity0 was blasted on @entity5 and in blog posts for his comments , which were made earlier on thursday at an event for women in computing			1
he had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise			2
his response : ' it 's not really about asking for the raise , but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along			0
' not asking for raise , he added , is ' good karma ' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility			0
in it , @entity0 said he answered the question ' completely wrong ' and that he thinks ' men and women should get equal pay for equal work			1
and when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it 's deserved , @entity40 's advice was the right advice			0
if you think you deserve a raise , you should just ask			0
' his interviewer at the event , @entity47 , president of @entity48 and a @entity1 director , had told him she disagreed , which drew cheers from the audience			2
she suggested women do their homework on salary information and first practice asking with people they trust			2
still , his comments at the event , the @entity61 , underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities			2
tech companies , particularly the engineering ranks , are overwhelmingly male , white and @entity70			2
courting controversy : @entity0 , left , made the gaffe while being interviewed by @entity1 board member @entity47 , right , at the @entity61 criticized for their lack of diversity , major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding			1
twenty - nine percent of @entity1 's employees are women , according to figures the @entity86 , @entity87 - based company released earlier this month			1
its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female			1
that 's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies this year			0
' without a doubt i wholeheartedly support programs at @entity1 and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap , ' @entity0 wrote in his memo to employees			1
the gaffe came towards the end of a q & a session conducted by @entity47 , a member of @entity1 's board of directors , who asked @entity0 for an advice for women who are not comfortable asking for a raise			1
' it 's not really about asking for a raise , but knowing and having faith that the system will give you the right raise , ' he responded , reportedly sending murmurs of indignation through a crowd of 500 women sitting in the audience			0
' that might be one of the initial ' super powers ' that , quite frankly , women [ who ] do n't ask for a raise have , ' he continued			0
' it 's good karma			0
' @entity47 disagreed with @entity0 's career advice , urging women to be tough negotiators when it comes to asking for compensation			2
to emphasize her point , @entity47 , a well - regarded computer scientist , told the audience how she settled for a salary $ 50,000 lower than she had deemed appropriate when she was offered the position of dean of engineering at @entity143 , @entity135 reported			0
@entity0 did not have to wait long for a reaction to his words of wisdom as @entity5 lit up with highly critical posts			1
backtrack : @entity0 quickly took to @entity5 to apologize for his ' tone - deaf ' remarks ' that @ satyanadella thought that was reasonable advice says volumes about how little @ @entity1 understands and wants to solve the problem , ' wrote @entity153 , ceo of @entity154			1
@entity155 tweeted at @entity0 : ' this ca n't be positively spun			2
' the recently appointed ceo of @entity1 quickly went into damage control mode thursday afternoon , tweeting to his followers : ' was inarticulate re how women should ask for raise			1
our industry must close gender pay gap so a raise is not needed because of a bias			0
' he then followed up by releasing the text of a company - wide email addressing his gaffe , in which he readily admitted that he answered @entity47 's question about raises ' completely wrong			0
' contrite : @entity0 later sent a company - wide email admitting that he answered the question about raises ' completely wrong ' ' without a doubt i wholeheartedly support programs at @entity1 and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap			1
' i believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work			0
and when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it 's deserved , @entity40 's advice was the right advice			0
' if you think you deserve a raise , you should just ask			0
' @entity0 's controversial and arguably tone - deaf remarks come a week after @entity1 released figures showing that the company 's staff was about 29 per cent female , and that 17 per cent of employees occupying position of leadership within the company were women .			1

@entity0 made the gaffe at the @entity61
he later issued an apology on @entity5 , saying he was ' inarticulate '
@entity1 *â€™s* leadership is only 17.3 percent according to latest figures
women make up almost *45* percent of the *non-tech* jobs at @entity1 , but only 17 percent of the tech positions
