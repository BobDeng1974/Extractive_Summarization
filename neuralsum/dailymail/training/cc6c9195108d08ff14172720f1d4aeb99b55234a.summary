the @entity1 schoolboy trapped in @entity2 after developing a fear of flying is still in the @entity5 state a year after @entity6 highlighted his plight			1
@entity8 , now 12 , had been due to fly back to @entity1 with his family last june after his father @entity11 ’s work contract in the @entity12 ended			1

he subsequently refused to travel home by boat and overland			1
now , a year later , @entity8 remains stranded 4,500 miles from home with his father while his worsening mental condition continues to baffle psychiatrists			1
stuck : @entity8 has now developed an intense fear of all forms of transport and his behaviour has left psychiatrists baffled parted : @entity8 and his mother @entity27 who can only see her son when she comes out to @entity29 on holiday the situation has reached an expensive impasse for mr @entity8 , 63 , who risks bankruptcy as he tries to reconcile his son ’s condition with his responsibility to his distraught wife @entity27 , 49 , and daughter @entity37 , 17 , who are back at the family home in @entity40			1
mr @entity8 , a former aide to @entity41 , has pleaded for help to rescue his young son after spending his savings and borrowing £ 40,000 to fund their unexpected extended stay in @entity2			1
impressive : there could be worse places to be stranded in the world than @entity2 he now fears he might be forced to sell their home in @entity1			1
@entity8 has been diagnosed with @entity53 and @entity54 , but mr @entity8 thinks his son ’s problems go far deeper			2
he said : ‘ the hypnotherapists and behavioural therapists he has seen said this is not all about flying			0
there ’s something blocking him in the @entity1			0
he now needs some kind of medical intervention to prise open the secret			0
’ in the past year @entity8 has also been prescribed the anti-depressants @entity68 and @entity70 but he still refuses to return home and fills his time playing rugby , seeing friends , watching tv and going to the mall to surf @entity77			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ i ’ve tried all the tactics to encourage @entity8			2
when i ’ve no money left , i will sit on the @entity1 @entity82 steps and say , “ here are our passports , we need help			0
” ’ the situation has put a huge strain on mr @entity8 ’s marriage			2
‘ it ’s difficult because i do n’t see @entity27 , ’ he said			0
‘ but it ’s no different to somebody in the military being sent away			0
we realise we have an end objective to get @entity8 home			1
it ’s like a project we ’re working on			0
the biggest strain is a financial one			0
’ mr @entity8 said he needed £ 3,000 a month to stay in @entity2			1
he and @entity98 have moved into a small , two - bedroom flat in @entity100 , after staying with friends who took pity on them			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ it ’s not as if @entity8 ’s living a life of luxury			2
there ’s no swimming pool or internet access			0
it ’s so different to the six - bedroom villa we had when i came out here to work as quality manager at a private hospital			0
‘ it ’s amazing a year has gone by			0
