@entity1 fans have spent years dreaming about the day when they might be able to drive one			0
and now hoverbikes are set to become a reality as soon as 2017			2
one company in @entity6 has created a bike that will let members of the public speed along at up to 45mph ( 72km/h ) while hovering up to 12ft ( 3.6 metres ) above the ground			1
@entity40 told @entity41 : ' while development timing is always tricky to predict , we have been working on the vehicle for quite a long time ... although it may not appear the case , in our eyes the @entity35 is very similar to our flying prototype , which gives us confidence we are on path to deliver as promised			1
' a $ 5,000 ( £ 2,983 ) refundable deposit is needed			1
the vehicle is a hovercraft that reportedly rides like a motorbike and because of this , users can learn to operate it within a weekend			1
the company says that the two - seater vehicle can be adapted for different off - road uses , such as search and rescue , border patrol , disaster relief and farming			1
although judging by the popular sci - fi film , driving it in a forest may prove perilous			2
the @entity35 can fly for up to one - and - a - half hours and measures almost 15ft ( 4.5 metres ) long , 7ft ( 2metres ) wide and is 4ft ( 1.25 metres ) high			1
it weighs in at 785lbs ( 365kg )			0
@entity1 for real : the real - life hoverbike created by @entity6 firm @entity40 was tested in the @entity73 desert and a video revealing the innovation to the world was released in 2012 soon you could be a @entity78 : @entity40 's @entity35 bike resembles the hoverbikes that feature in @entity81 , where they were used in a thrilling forest chase ( pictured ) futuristic : the 21st century @entity86 version is built primarily of carbon fibre and has two ducted rotors facing the ground ( pictured ) enabling it to hover			1
the vehicle has been tested in the desert and consumers should be able to get their hands on it in 2017 , according to the @entity6 - based firm built primarily of carbon fibre , it has two ducted rotors facing the ground enabling it to hover			1
changing the angle of the rotors using two control sticks allows it to manoeuvred in different directions			1
the hoverbike responds to a pilot 's leaning movements and natural sense of balance			0
it takes off vertically and lands without runways or forward speed			0
the production model will have numerous safety features including a roll bar and whole vehicle airbags			2
hovering bikes were made famous by ' @entity81 , ' where they were piloted by @entity118 and flown through a forest , but the real life version has been tested in the safer surroundings of the @entity73			2
in 2012 @entity40 released a video of an employee riding the vehicle and at the time said that it planned on releasing pilotless - versions of the technology at the end of this year			2
as to whether we will be riding hoverbikes to work in the future , the @entity40 said : ' i do not think you will ever see these vehicles on the road			0
they are designed for rural utility and would not be useful as a commuter vehicle			0
in addition , the legal barriers to such use are presently very high			0
' we may see a derivative of this type of vehicle over the roads in the far off future , but that path is difficult to foresee			0
' the hoverbike responds to a human pilot 's leaning movements and natural sense of balance			0
it takes off vertically and lands without runways or forward speed , much like the fictional version in @entity1 ( pictured )			0

a company in @entity6 created the bike that will let people reach speeds of 45mph ( 72km/h ) while hovering up to 12ft ( 3.6metres ) above the ground
@entity35 will be sold for $ 85,000 ( £ 50,730 ) and has a delivery date of 2017
it uses two ducted rotors facing the ground to hover and resembles the @entity172 hover bikes in @entity173
vehicle rides like a motorbike and riders can learn to control it in two days
two - seater vehicle could be used in disaster relief and farming
