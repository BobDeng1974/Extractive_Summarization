he suffered severe injuries in the fall as he was walking out of the staff room at a secondary school in @entity15			0
the personal injury claim was settled outside court by council chiefs who believed they may have been forced to shell out up to £ 500,000 including legal fees if the case had gone ahead			1
yesterday it emerged that the payout was one of 34 handed to injured teachers in the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of £ 1.05million			1
critics have now complained of a ‘ compensation culture ’ in schools after it was revealed that other staff had claimed for slipping on wet floors or being injured by a cupboard door			2
the teacher in the ketchup incident was hurt on march 18 2008 , but did not file a claim until march 10 2011 – just eight days before the three - year legal time limit for making personal injury claims			1
a freedom of information request revealed that the council agreed a final settlement of £ 230,000 in april last year , including £ 90,000 in damages for pain , suffering and loss of amenity as well as damages for losses such as those relating to earnings and pension			1

another employee received £ 39,450 after suffering a wrist injury when a faulty metal door swung open when they were taking plates to a cupboard			2
@entity70 of the @entity71 ’ @entity69 said : ‘ the compensation culture appears to be more common in the school yard than a grazed knee			0
' wasting taxpayers ’ money on unnecessary payouts leaves less money available for teaching and higher tax bills for everyone else			0
the payment was part of more than £ 1million of compensation payments made to injured teachers by @entity86 over the past three years ( file picture ) ‘ legal costs on top of the actual payouts only add to the overall bill and the whole process undermines the ability of teachers to actually teach			1
' it ’s time schools resisted unscrupulous claims before teachers are unable to leave the staff room for fear of the school being sued			0
’ however , @entity102 , the @entity104 representative for @entity15 , said there is no compensation culture in schools			0
he said : ‘ we need to see these claims in context			0
' as a union we will support members who pursue claims for personal injury when we feel they have been poorly treated by management in schools			0
‘ schools are generally very safe environments but employers have a duty of care to protect both teachers and pupils			0
