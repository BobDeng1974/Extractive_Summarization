a two - year - old @entity1 boy who was born paralyzed from the waist down has been denied a wheelchair from his parent 's insurance company			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , the parents of toddler @entity9 , said they wanted their son to have a new wheelchair , however @entity13 refused to grant him one because he is too young			1
@entity6 said she was also told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old			0
crue , who was born with spina bifida , currently gets around in a $ 1,100 @entity19 , which is a miniature wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk			1
@entity6 said she was told he would be eligible when he is five years old @entity6 , 29 , a mother - of - two , said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent , according to @entity37			0
the family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in october			2
they resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago			0
on march 3 , @entity6 wrote on @entity42 that the claim had been denied			2
she wrote : ' i know that our son is only two but his mobility should n't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company , who has never met him			2
' @entity9 is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think			0
i do n't know where he would be without his little @entity19 chair			0
that chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own			0
' he 's been using that chair for almost two years now ( no thanks to the insurance )			0
i just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age , the difference they 'd be making in their lives			0
' an able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two ? ' @entity78 , who was born with spina bifida , currently gets around in a $ 1,100 @entity19 , which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk ( crue pictured above in his @entity19 wheelchair ) @entity13 has said the child 's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline			1
' our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor , despite efforts by @entity13 to obtain this information , did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired , ' @entity91 , spokesman for @entity13 told @entity37			1
the insurance company also said the family can appeal the decision that the chair is not necessary for @entity9 , according to @entity13			1
the toddler 's parents plan to appeal the decision and keep fighting for their son			2
insurance company , @entity13 , said the child 's doctor is at fault for submitting the required documents in a timely fashion ( above , @entity9 pictured in february during his routine kidney and bladder check up ) @entity78 's parents plan to appeal the decision given by the insurance company and will keep fighting for their son ( above @entity9 pictured in january enjoying sled hockey ) @entity6 began sharing her son 's story on @entity42 , which led a close friend of theirs to start a donation page to help raise funds so that @entity9 could have a new wheelchair			1
as their friend , @entity126 , was only intending to raise $ 10,000 , by saturday $ 15,995 had been raised in donations			2
now @entity9 will also be able to have a standing walker and standing wheelchair			1
the donations will also help with many other of his other medical needs that are incurred on both a weekly and monthly basis			0
since @entity6 shared her son 's story on @entity42 , which led a close friend to help raise nearly $ 16,000 by saturday			1
