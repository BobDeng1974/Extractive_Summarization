@entity1 ’s thumping header in stoppage time gave @entity3 a dramatic win over @entity5 and sent them top of the @entity7			1
the @entity3 captain rose above a static @entity5 defence to power home an @entity12 corner with just seconds left on the clock			1
this was a contest that had meandered along for 87 minutes until @entity12 , seeking to persuade @entity16 that he deserved a starting place in the first team with @entity19 suspended until november , curled a breathtaking free - kick into the top corner			1
@entity3 captain @entity1 ( @entity22 ) celebrates his late winner in the 2 - 1 victory over @entity5 @entity1 capped off a fine week after making his first team debut by scoring the winner @entity3 youngsters celebrate after @entity12 opens the scoring with a late free - kick @entity12 ( second left ) is mobbed by his team - mates after curling home a free - kick to give @entity3 the lead @entity34 ( @entity35 ) levelled the game for @entity5 just one minute after @entity12 's opener in the 88th minute @entity5 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( c ) , @entity42 , ( @entity43 46 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 58 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity34 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 76 ) substitutes not used : @entity51 ( gk ) scorer : @entity34 88 booked : @entity39 , @entity40 @entity3 : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity1 ( c ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity12 , @entity59 ( @entity60 45 +1 ) , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 46 ) substitutes not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 scorers : @entity12 87 ; @entity1 90 +2 referee : @entity69 attendance : 1,671 but straight from the re-start , @entity3 ’s defence hesitated and the impressive @entity34 outjumped @entity53 in a 50 - 50 contest to win the bouncing ball and blast home from close range			1
yet the drama was n’t quite over as @entity80 ’s team , in classic @entity3 style , plundered victory in injury time at the @entity84 through a captain 's intervention			2
@entity12 has threatened only sporadically prior to the last few minutes and put forward a weak argument that he should play ahead of @entity88 or anyone else in the first team			0
but a moment of improvisation from the free - kick and an inch - perfect corner may yet persuade @entity95 to throw him in against @entity96 on sunday			1
@entity3 coach @entity97 fielded no less than six players with first - team experience : @entity12 and @entity53 , of course , but also @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity58 and @entity62			2
all but the @entity102 goalkeeper in that half - dozen were involved in that horror night at @entity104 just over a month ago			0
@entity12 was certainly the main attraction for the sizeable crowd assembled on a foggy night in @entity107 but his dazzling footwork was only seen in glimpses during a disappointing first - half			0
@entity5 's @entity34 jumps for joy after scoring his team 's equalised just a minute after @entity12 's goal @entity1 ( @entity22 ) made a winning return to the @entity115 after his brief exploits for the first team on saturday @entity5 under 21 coach @entity118 ( @entity35 ) talks to @entity49 before kick off @entity3 starlet @entity12 shows his experience as he skips past @entity5 's @entity47 ( r ) the result took @entity3 to the top of the @entity7 21 @entity7 it took nearly 10 minutes to get the ball to the @entity125 ’s feet , only for his purposeful run to be halted by @entity34			1
we were approaching the half hour by the time @entity12 again had chance to burst forward , detecting and finding @entity56 on the overlap			0
his cross found @entity58 , whose shot from the edge of the box was bravely blocked by @entity5 captain @entity41			0
@entity134 of @entity5 ( r ) holds up the ball under pressure from @entity3 's @entity63 @entity5 boss @entity137 was at @entity107 to take a look at the next generation @entity3 's main man @entity12 ( c ) races away from three @entity5 players 9min the @entity125 get the ball at his feet for the first time and sets off on a run down the left			1
he gets past two defenders but is muscled out by @entity34 @entity149 again has the opportunity to burst forward down the left , this time laying it wide to @entity56 on the overlap			0
it leads to a chance for @entity58 70min after a quiet second half , @entity12 gets an opportunity with a set - piece 25 yards out but curls the ball wide 87min with the game heading for a stalemate , @entity12 bends in a superb free - kick from wide on the right			1
with the perfect pitch and loft , it flies over the head of goalkeeper @entity38 and into the net			0
90 +1min delivers the corner that is met by @entity3 captain @entity1 to win the match @entity3 ’s only other chance of note came when @entity62 , who memorably scored those two goals against @entity174 on his first - team debut at the fag end of last season , forced a save from @entity38 after @entity54 ’s mis - hit fell kindly for him			1
instead it was @entity5 who looked more threatening and @entity182 under 18 international @entity34 , powerful and omnipresent , was their stand - out performer			2
on 11 minutes , he worked half - a - yard inside the box and curled a shot over the bar after @entity44 had picked him out from the right , and he seemed to have some kind of involvement in every @entity5 attack after that			2
just before that , @entity46 crossed left - footed and tall frontman @entity49 could n’t direct a difficult header on target			0
@entity48 also sent a flicked header wide of the mark from an @entity39 as @entity5 continuously profited down the right			0
but @entity53 was n’t actually troubled until two minutes into the second half when @entity48 forced him into a save at his near post with a low drive			0
two minutes later , he turned a vicious @entity34 shot round the post as @entity5 continued to take the game to @entity3			2
@entity137 , watching from the stands , would have been impressed with his team 's application			0
@entity54 ( @entity35 ) of @entity3 battles for the ball with @entity34 during the first - half stalemate @entity3 under 21 coach @entity80 barks orders from the touchline @entity61 ( r ) of @entity3 and @entity47 try and break the deadlock after the interval @entity5 forward @entity44 ( c ) is brought down by @entity57 of @entity3 finally , @entity3 stirred			1
@entity40 was forced into a hasty clearance under pressure from @entity215 with @entity216 nowhere near it			0
@entity12 at last started to make his presence felt after switching to the right but his best opportunity came from a dead ball rather than dancing feet , when he curled a free - kick wide from a good position 25 yards from goal			1
it looked for all the world at that point we were heading for a stalemate , but the drama was just beginning			0
@entity12 has yet to start a match for @entity3 this season but has come on every time he has been on the bench			2
is he destined to be @entity3 's impact sub like @entity236 was ? vs @entity237 66 minutes - came on for @entity238 vs @entity239 27 minutes - came on for @entity240 vs @entity104 70 minutes - came on for @entity241 vs @entity242 3 minutes - came on for @entity88 vs @entity243 8 minutes - came on for @entity244 vs @entity245 18 minutes - came on for @entity246 @entity12 falls to the ground after opening the scoring with a late free - kick like our @entity3 facebook page here .			1

@entity254 defeated @entity255 21s 2 - 1 at the @entity84
@entity12 opened the scoring with a curling free - kick after 87mins
@entity34 equalised for @entity5 only one minute later
@entity1 sealed the win with a header from @entity12 's corner on *90mins*
@entity12 had *struggled* to make an impression before the final few minutes
@entity125 is trying to *convince* @entity16 to give him a starting berth
late drama sent @entity3 top of the @entity7 21 @entity7
