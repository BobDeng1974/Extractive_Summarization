by @entity0 these unsettling images show the skulls and wax - covered heads of @entity5 criminals lined up on shelves , some identified with labels that read ' thief ' or ' murderer '			2
the macabre display at a museum in @entity13 , @entity5 , is the result of 19th - century physician and psychiatrist @entity17 's research on criminality			1
many of the body parts were taken from prisons without the permission of family members			0
inside the head of a criminal : hundreds of skulls , some covered in wax , line the shelves at the museum guilt : many of the wax faces in @entity35 's collection are labelled with their crime			2
right , ' killer of a wife ' now , hundreds of years later , some of the criminal 's descendants and local communities are saying it is time to get the body parts back			0
@entity17 's work on criminal behaviour , now discredited , is nevertheless described by the @entity47 as laying the foundations for modern criminology			1
he moved away from the nature of the crime towards the individual 's motivation and habits			0
in 1862 , he began anthropometric measurements of 3,000 soldiers , gradually becoming interested in psychiatry and criminal anthropology			0
his 1876 book @entity60 argued that some people were born criminals - it claimed they were ‘ atavistic ’ , or throwbacks to a primitive stage of evolution			1
@entity17 believed ‘ primitiveness ’ could be read from the bodies and habits of such born criminals - for instance , facial features , body type and tattooing , which he saw as a particular sign of criminality			2
@entity17 's work on criminal behaviour , now discredited , involved taking anthropometric measurements bizarre : a wax - covered head with a tag reading ' @entity81 ' , left , and tools used for the theft , right death row : many of the skulls on display in @entity13 were taken from jails without the family 's permission this emphasis on external marks and ‘ primitiveness ’ was part of a broader movement in the late 1800s , which believed biology and inheritance explained human behaviour			1
a great worry was that @entity104 ‘ races ’ were degenerating - slipping back to an earlier stage of evolution			0
from 1866 onwards , the year in which @entity17 began to work as a military doctor , he collected skulls , skeletons , brains and various other types of objects , which formed the core collection of a private museum , first housed at his home in @entity13			1
to the collection of skulls of soldiers and civilians from all the various regions in @entity5 , he soon added craniums from far - off lands , and even those of criminals and madmen , which he collected in prisons and asylums			0
strange : @entity17 believed some people were born criminals and had ' primitive ' qualities ' throwback ' : @entity17 said criminality could be read in a face			1
pictured , bandit @entity138 's skull			0

physician took heads from prisons without family permission
@entity17 's work on the criminal mind is now discredited
but he laid the foundation for criminology by looking at motivations
he claimed criminals were born , and had ' primitive ' physical qualities
believed they were atavistic ' throwbacks ' to early stages of evolution
the skulls , labelled by *misdemeanour* , are on display in @entity13
