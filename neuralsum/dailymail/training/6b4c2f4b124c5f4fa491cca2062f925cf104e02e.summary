@entity0 remain on course to begin their tour of @entity3 with victory after closing day two of their tour match with a @entity9 307 runs ahead in @entity10			1
on a day where 19 wickets fell , the tourists built on the platform they had been given by centuries from @entity16 and @entity17 on monday to move to 443 all out in their first innings			1
in reply , @entity19 were dismissed for a paltry 179 inside 50 overs , with @entity23 seamer @entity22 taking four for 29 , and although @entity0 stuttered to 43 for three second time around , they are still firmly on top in this tour opener			2
@entity26 reaches his half century as @entity0 take a commanding lead against a @entity28 @entity29 failed to become @entity0 's third centurion of the innings on tuesday morning , dismissed for 85 in the second over of the day after edging @entity33 to second slip			1
@entity26 batted well with the lower order , bringing up his half - century shortly before fellow @entity36 edged behind off @entity37 for 11			0
@entity26 eventually retired out for 62 , with five fours and a six , before @entity0 were all out for a commanding total			0
@entity19 limped to 46 for four in reply as @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity22 each took a wicket			0
@entity46 drives straight during day 2 of the @entity0 ' tour of @entity3 @entity48 and @entity49 showed some backbone , but just as they were settling into their stride , the former was bowled by @entity42 for 23 and after the tea interval the hosts ' captain fell for 27 after flashing @entity41 to gully			2
that left @entity19 on 104 for six and in serious arrears , but @entity59 and @entity37 staged a mini-recovery in the final session			0
@entity59 thumped @entity46 over long - on twice for back - to - back sixes and crashed a four back over the bowler 's head for good measure off the next delivery			0
but the leg - spinner would have his revenge by bowling the batsman , who top - scored for @entity19 with 39 , while @entity37 was on his way soon after for 36 when he was clean bowled by @entity22 , who ran through the tail with three wickets in nine balls to dismiss the hosts in 49.3 overs			0
@entity0 captain @entity76 had decided against an earlier follow - on to give his batsmen more practice that left the @entity0 with a sizeable advantage of 264 , although captain @entity76 opted against the follow - on preferring to give further practice to his batsmen			1
that backfired slightly as @entity16 was dismissed for one , while @entity85 added just six before he fell to the last ball of the day			2
in - between , @entity17 contributed 25 from 29 balls and although he too was back in the pavilion before the close , @entity76 , playing in @entity0 colours for the first time since the 2013 @entity92 , was unbeaten on 10 .			1

@entity0 are 307 runs ahead of a @entity9 on day two
@entity16 and @entity17 had hit centuries in earlier innings
