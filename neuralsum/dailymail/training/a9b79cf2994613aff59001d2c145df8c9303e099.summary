by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 9 november 2012 there are already shrines somewhere in the world for taps , lunchboxes , lawnmowers , carrots and even salt and pepper shakers - but one household item more important than all of those had been shamefully overlooked			2
the world 's first ' toilet theme park ' has opened in @entity14 , a bizarre homage to indoor sanitation and everything we put into it			1
the ' @entity19 ' in @entity20 has been opened in memory and tribute to former mayor @entity23 , affectionately known as ' mr toilet ' , who campaigned his entire life to improve @entity14 's often antiquated public conveniences			1
the stinker ? this thoughtful character is one of many toilet - related statues around the museum f - art exhibition : the theme park features a display of toilet - related artworks squatting rights : this cheeky sculpture is outside the museum cheeky : this young visitor gets in the spirit shrine to the throne : this is the toilet - shaped house belonging to @entity20 's former mayor @entity44 which has been converted into the world 's first toilet theme park honour : @entity44 devoted his life to improving the state of public toilets in @entity14 and founded the @entity51 and this extraordinary place reflects everything he achieved - and it certainly seems @entity14 takes after @entity54 in terms of ' toilet humour			1
' from the bronze statues of people sitting on the toilet dotted around outside , to the converted toilet - shaped house which contains an exhibition on toilets through the ages , everything here is themed after one thing			1
there is even a room devoted to toilet - related art - fitting in a city which holds the annual @entity71 art festival			2
it might not seem like the most attractive tourist destination , but @entity74 , who works at the park , thinks differently			2
she told the @entity77 : ' we just focus on eating everyday , we sometimes overlook the importance of the toilet			0
' we already know upon waking up in the morning we should go to the toilet but people do n't want to talk about this			0
' so we wanted to demonstrate to the public out ' toilet culture '			0
the toilet is not just a toilet , it can be a cultural space			0
' [ they are ] so important for health , sanitation and water conservation			0
' mr @entity44 agreed - he was reportedly born in his grandmother 's @entity93 , as this apparently brings good luck , and spent much of his working life trying to improve facilities			0
he founded the @entity51 and unveiled his impressive toilet - shaped house on the eve of the organisation 's first @entity101 meeting in 2002			1
the people of @entity20 take great pride in them too and some are even tourist spots			2
they also stumped up the cash so his Â£ 1.2m toilet - shaped house could be converted into a theme park after his death			1
@entity111 will tell if it becomes a must - visit destination .			0

the ' @entity114 ' has opened near @entity20 in homage to former mayor and toilet campaigner @entity23
the bizarre theme park features a toilet - shaped house converted into a museum and an exhibition of toilet - themed art
