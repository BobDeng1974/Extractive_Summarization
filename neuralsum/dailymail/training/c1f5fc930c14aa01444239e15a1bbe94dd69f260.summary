by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 04:47 est , 19 june 2013 groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of @entity4 may predate the emergence of multicellular life , but it certainly does n't taste great , a leading scientist has claimed			2
a joint @entity8 and @entity4 team discovered the ancient pockets of water , which they say are like ' trapped time capsules ' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years			1
but @entity13 , an @entity14 sciences professor at the @entity15 , who is studying the water , has described the water as tasting ' terrible ' after feeling compelled to take a sip			1
the water could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life , the researchers claim , as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight			1
a joint @entity8 and @entity4 team discovered the ancient pockets of groundwater in @entity4 , found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface			2
they have been described as like ' trapped time capsules ' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years more exciting still , the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on @entity40 raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the @entity40			1
in an interview with the @entity47 , she said that what jumps out at you first is the saltiness			0
she said : ' because of the reactions between the water and the rock , it is extremely salty			0
it is more viscous than tap water			0
it has the consistency of a very light maple syrup			0
it does n't have colour when it comes out , but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy colour because the minerals in it begin to form — especially the iron			1
' she added that ' you would definitely not want to drink this stuff '			0
professor @entity13 explained that scientists are interested in the saltiest waters because they are the oldest , and tasting is the quick - and - dirty way to find which are the most salty			1
she said she did n't let students indulge in the prehistoric tipple however			0
researchers from the universities of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 analysed the water which poured out of boreholes in a mine 7,875ft beneath @entity89 , @entity4			2
' these are like trapped time capsules , ' said professor @entity13			1
' they may tell us about the atmosphere 2.7 billion years ago , and about the fluids that formed the valuable ore deposits that are the foundation of @entity4 ’s mineral wealth			0
' geochemical reactions with the rocks means the water contains dissolved hydrogen and methane , as well as noble gases like helium , neon , argon and xenon , that have been trapped since early in @entity14 ’s history			1
the water could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life , the researchers claim , as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight			1
these gases could provide energy for microbes that may not have been exposed to the sun for billions of years , the researchers say			2
project leader @entity122 , of the @entity82 , said : ' our finding is of huge interest to researchers who want to understand how microbes evolve in isolation , and is central to the whole question of the origin of life , the sustainability of life , and life in extreme environments and on other planets			0
' using ground - breaking techniques developed at the @entity82 , the researchers say they have shown that the fluid is at least 1.5 billion years old , but could be significantly older			2
it could even date back to the formation of the crystalline rocks surrounding the water , which are thought to be around 2.7billion years old - about half as old as the planet earth itself			1
before this finding , the only water of this age was found trapped in tiny bubbles of rock , but the water found in the @entity4 mine on the other hand pours from the rock at a rate of nearly two litres per minute			2
it has similar characteristics to far younger water flowing from a mine 1.7 miles below ground in @entity161 that was previously found to support microbes			2
dr @entity163 of @entity164 said : ' our @entity4 colleagues are trying to find out if the water contains life right now			0
' what we can be sure of is that we have identified a way in which planets can create and preserve an environment friendly to microbial life for billions of years			2
' large regions of @entity40 are made up of terrain like that of the @entity14 ’s @entity177 – billions of years - old rocks with similar mineralogy			1
professor @entity180 said : ' the ancient waters of the @entity177 contain abundant chemicals that we know microbes can use as energy in the absence of sunlight - driven photosynthesis			0
' this shows that ancient rocks have the potential to support life and this could be the case whether they are three km below the @entity14 ’s surface or below the surface of @entity40			1
' the @entity177 discovery pushes the age of water much farther back than the @entity161 discovery , identifying a groundwater system isolated from the surface for billions , rather than tens of millions of years			1
' our discovery establishes that ancient fluids , hitherto thought to have survived only in microscopic fluid inclusions trapped in the rocks , may instead still flow from ancient fractures , ' said professor @entity180			1
professor @entity122 , who is based in @entity82 ’s @entity207 , added : ' while the questions about life on @entity40 raised by our work are incredibly exciting , the ground - breaking techniques we have developed at @entity82 to date ancient waters also provide a way to calculate how fast methane gas is produced in ancient rock systems globally			1
' the same new techniques can be applied to characterise old , deep groundwater that may be a safe place to inject carbon dioxide			0
' @entity220 , minister for universities and science , said : ' this is excellent pioneering research			0
it gives new insight into our planet			0
' it has also developed new technology for carbon capture and storage projects			0
these have the potential for growth , job creation and our environment			0
' the findings were published today in the journal @entity238 .			0

professor @entity13 admitted to sipping the ancient water and described it as ' *exceptionally* salty with an orangy colour '
*primeval* pockets of water are like ' trapped time capsules ' cut off from the @entity14 *'s* surface for nearly billions of years , researchers say
the similarity between the rocks in the mine and those on @entity40 raises the hope that similar life - sustaining water could exist on the nearby planet
