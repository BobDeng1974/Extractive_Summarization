forty two shots at goal			0
that was the incredible total registered by @entity3 as they blew @entity4 away			1
four of them went in and 14 of them were on target , including a hat - trick from @entity9			1
just why is it they are sacking @entity12 at the end of the season again ? still their soon - to - be - former manager kept alive chances of promotion to the @entity19 , having only guided them up from @entity20 last season , with this obliteration			1
@entity3 striker @entity9 jumps for joy after he completed his hat - trick in the 89th minute of the game @entity9 is congratulated by team - mate @entity26 after he opened the scoring for @entity3 @entity3 : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity26 ( @entity33 62 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 66 ) , @entity37 , @entity9 , @entity38 ( long 62 )			1

subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 sent off : @entity52 ref : @entity65 att : 8,765 owner @entity66 claimed he had the long - term interests of the club at heart when he made the decision axe @entity12 after this campaign			2
he may live to rue that largely unpopular choice if @entity12 ’s replacement fails to work the same miracles with this set of players			0
after 16 minutes of constant pressure they took the lead			0
a slick passing move - one of many - ended with @entity26 in plenty of space inside the box on the left and he could have shot himself but passed into @entity9 to poke in			2
two minutes later and @entity3 were two ahead			0
this time they found space down the right and @entity38 crossed deep to @entity45 to head in completely free at the back post for his second of the night			0
@entity4 ’s first - half penalty area was heavily patched up with sand , but it made the @entity89 no more at home as @entity3 poured forward with waves of attack			1
@entity38 should have put @entity3 three ahead when he ran through on goal with time and space , but @entity4 goalkeeper @entity46 was out quickly to block			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity28 celebrates following @entity9 's opening strike at @entity96 @entity3 's @entity38 scores his side 's third goal of the night despite the attention of @entity56 when @entity4 ’s @entity101 was shown a straight red card for a lunge on @entity104 a minute before the break , it was hard to imagine a worse half of football for one side			1
predictably , seven minutes into the second half the home side went three ahead when @entity38 saw a spectacular volley saved but collected the rebound and beat the keeper via the right post			1
@entity37 had a vicious shot saved from inside the box on the right and @entity38 had another go , turning a defender and getting a shot away which was again kept out			0
@entity4 manager @entity121 ( right ) shouts some orders on the sideline as his side suffer yet another loss granted , @entity4 are an embarrassment to the division , rock bottom and already 12 points adrift of safety			2
but no team , however much a gulf in class between the sides , should be so cut open in one match			0
as the game rolled on it became more like a training ground affair ; an attack versus defence drill			0
@entity12 threw on two more forwards - @entity36 and @entity142 - for shooting practice			0
but it was @entity9 who completed the rout , and his treble , with a close - range finish in the 89th minute			1
deservedly , @entity12 ’s name rang from the stands as the final whistle blew .			0

@entity9 grabs brace in space of three first - half minutes for @entity3
@entity101 was sent of for @entity4 , who remain rooted to the bottom
the @entity159 , who is on loan from @entity161 , completed his hat - trick in the 89th minute
@entity38 also netted for @entity12 's side , who maintain an interest in the promotion push
