stealing the show at the interstellar film premiere this week was n’t its star , @entity3 , but rather her necklace			1
or should that be ‘ backlace ’ ? for the 31 - year - old accessorised her deep - blue satin @entity9 gown with a delicate silver chain decorated with stars which hung down her back instead of her decolletage			1
but she ’s far from the first actress to challenge convention with this look : @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have all worn the back necklace — or ‘ back drop ’ — on the red carpet in recent years			1
in fact , princess @entity22 even tried it with pearls nearly 30 years ago			1
subtler than a piece that nestles in the cleavage , a heavy chain hanging between the shoulder blades is a signal of independence : not for you the boring convention or obvious statement			1
and , as the back ages so well and wrinkles less than other parts of the body , it ’s a marvellous way for an older woman to draw attention away from a crepey bosom			1
there ’s something , too , about the slight weight of that drop at the back that seems to improve posture , straightening the shoulders , raising the head and pushing the pelvis forward , to show the jewellery off to best advantage			1
not every necklace or dress will work for this look			0
a lariat works best : a favourite of flappers showing off their daring backless frocks , it is a long , clasp - free chain or string of gems that can be knotted or looped at just the right spot , leaving the remaining length to hang dramatically down the spine			1
the 31 - year - old accessorised her deep - blue satin @entity9 gown with a chain which hung down her back instead of her decolletage other necklaces are designed specifically for this look , with tiers and loops that are shaped for the width of a shoulder rather than a chest , and clasps where they wo n’t be seen			1
but even a simple pendant can work beautifully : a heavy , jewelled tassel , for example , adds the necessary weight to hold the necklace in place , rather than having it slip forward or tangle up in your hair or a dress			1
the crucial factor , though , is to give the necklace room to breathe : it should not clash with the straps of a dress , the back of a corset , or long , loose hair , but drape elegantly into the space created by a deep - cut back unimpeded by straps or corsetry			0
here we look at the stars who really have put their necks on the line			0
@entity18 it ’s a good job that this @entity114 dress is as plain as can be , because for the 2008 @entity115 , 47 - year - old @entity18 donned a massive 1,399 carats of rough diamonds designed into an immense collar by @entity118			1
while it looks like a back necklace , it can be worn either way			2
this one works , but its ostentatiousness lacks some of the panache of simple pendants and lariats			2
@entity17 this look could n’t be better			2
the 45 - year - old ’s silk @entity131 dress with its deep asymmetrical back is complemented by the v shape formed by @entity136 & @entity138 ’s @entity137 ( it actually does zip up and down ) with its diamond chain and pink sapphire tassel			2
the soft rose - gold warms up that expanse of skin , too , and the simple shape works on a character as strong as @entity17			1
@entity19 looking pitch - perfect at the @entity147 in 2010 , 35 - year - old @entity19 gets everything right here , teaming a high - necked , long - sleeved @entity150 gown with a @entity152 diamond - tassel necklace , which swings down a plunging back			2
the diamonds pick up the sparkle of the white dress , and the simplicity of the silhouette leaves room for the necklace to really shine			0
no wonder she looks happy			0
@entity162 there ’s so much to love here — and the biggest thing is that incredible @entity172 ’ necklace from @entity168 : 60 carats of diamonds , with a 12.16 - carat diamond drop at the tip. its construction means that the serpent ’s tail drapes languidly down the back , neat but fluid at the same time			0
the 46 - year - old actress ’s side - swept hair gives the necklace plenty of space , revealing a long neck and toned shoulders			0
the dark sparkles on the pretty @entity185 dress , however , do clash somewhat with all that glittering ice			0
@entity187 the weight of the chimpanzee pendant by @entity190 — featuring 771 black diamonds , yellow - sapphire bananas and a massive 28 - carat sapphire — makes 22 - year - old @entity195 ’s necklace hang beautifully , and the short length means it perfectly frames her tattoo , rather than clashing with it			2
having a real feature , such as this extraordinary animal , is a great idea , giving some purpose to the back - to - front necklace			0
what does clash , though , is the dark metal chain of the necklace and the silvery chain on her dress straps			0
@entity211 like @entity3 , 24 - year - old @entity211 is a veteran of the back necklace , wearing a long one over a high - backed dress in 2013			2
here , at the @entity214 , she makes a better job of it by choosing a shorter necklace , with the @entity219 diamonds daintily drawing attention to her rear - view			0
@entity224 @entity225 , 32 , breaks a cardinal rule of the backlace , with loose hair — but gets away with it			0
it ’s partly down to the length of that @entity233 necklace , partly because the whole look is so elaborate thanks to the @entity237 dress , and because her posture makes the necklace swing loose from her back .			0

@entity3 stole the show at the @entity29 premiere with her backlace
the delicate silver chain hung down her back instead of her decolletage
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have worn the backlace
princess @entity22 even tried it with pearls nearly 30 years ago
done well , it can be deeply sexy
a chain hanging between the shoulder blades is a signal of independence
it ’s a great way for an older woman to draw attention away from their bosom
a lariat works best : a favourite of flappers
even a simple pendant can work beautifully
