a @entity1 mp and his estranged wife are involved in an extraordinary secret war on @entity4 over who was to blame for the break - up of their marriage			1
@entity9 , wife of @entity10 , used the website to accuse her husband of ‘ abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage ’ even though he claimed to be a ‘ devout @entity16 ’			1
shortly afterwards the damaging entry was deleted and the @entity19 ’ tit - for - tat wiki war continued as the account of their split was changed on the mp ’s profile , reflecting conflicting versions of events			2
@entity25 claims : conservative mp @entity10 shown here during a parliamentary debate , admits to sending the text but claims he had already told his wife face - to - face that he wanted a divorce the @entity32 has established most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the @entity35 where both work – mrs @entity9 as her husband ’s commons office manager			1
even more remarkably , some of the anonymous @entity41 entries appear to involve a code which echo opera buff mr @entity10 ’s role as treasurer of the parliamentary opera group			1
one of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as @entity50 , after @entity52 ’s @entity51			2
others which sided with mrs @entity9 were made by @entity55 – @entity56 for the truth			1
former marketing director mr @entity10 , 46 , mp for @entity58 in @entity59 , and his 47 - year - old @entity61 - born wife have lived apart since april			1
in a statement yesterday , he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her ‘ in person ’			0
he said : ‘ i informed my ex-wife , in person , that i was going to file for divorce the day i left home			0
over subsequent days , i confirmed that decision through another conversation , a legal letter , and by text			2
' since then , friends claim she may have abused the @entity41 site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims			2
i did not edit any item on my wiki page			0
’ the ‘ text ’ claim was added to mr @entity10 ’s profile on august 1 : ‘ the couple separated in april 2013 , following mr @entity10 , a devout @entity16 , abandoning @entity9 and the marriage on 29th april by text			1
’ mr @entity10 ’s fightback started on august 6 , when allegations against him were deleted by @entity50			0
the next day , an account of their divorce changed back in favour of mrs @entity9			1
it said : ‘ contrary to inaccurate press reports , [ she ] filed the divorce petition citing “ @entity98 ”			0
[ sic ] ’ a battle raged over this and the ‘ text ’ entry again on august 8			0
eventually a user , @entity104 , had the last word by deleting reference to mr @entity10 ’s ‘ unreasonable behaviour ’			0
at present , there appears to be a truce , with no reference at all to mrs @entity9 on the mp ’s profile			2
mr @entity10 declined to comment on whether he was @entity50			0
@entity9 could not be reached for comment last night .			0
