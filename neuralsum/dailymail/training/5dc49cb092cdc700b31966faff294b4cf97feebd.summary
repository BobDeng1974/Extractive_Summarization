the sex scandal engulfing former @entity2 chief @entity1 and @entity4 ’s commander in @entity5 deepened yesterday when it emerged the two men had personally intervened in a messy child custody battle			1
while supposedly focused on the anti-terror agenda , two of the leading figures in the @entity4 security machine were writing glowing letters in support of the twin sister of the woman at the heart of the scandal			2
the revelation in court documents of their intervention on behalf of @entity22 – a woman a judge had ruled psychologically unstable – fuelled speculation over the extent of their involvement with her sister , @entity30 socialite @entity29			1
friends in high places : ( from left ) @entity22 @entity1 , @entity34 and @entity29 , and @entity35 watch the @entity37 parade from the comfort of a tent on the @entity29 's front lawn twins : @entity22 and @entity29 ( formerly khawam ) in their high school yearbook @entity1 ( left ) and general @entity44 ( right ) both gave letters of reference to help @entity22 's battle for child custody and in another twist in the affair , it was reported that general @entity44 , the @entity4 commander in @entity5 , sent emails to mrs @entity29 that were so explicit they were akin to ‘ phone sex ’			1
@entity44 , 58 , is under investigation by the @entity56 over up to 30,000 pages of messages of allegedly ‘ inappropriate communication ’ between him and 37 - year - old mrs @entity29 , a married mother of three			1
she has been portrayed as a flirtatious , cunning social climber who assiduously cultivated both @entity44 and @entity1 , a four - star general who became @entity2 director in september 2011 , and other senior officers while they were stationed at a base near her home in @entity69			1
a former intelligence officer claimed yesterday that she even browbeat a special forces admiral into allowing her to jump with @entity4 ’s top paratrooper commandos			0
‘ do not ever bring that lady back here again , ’ the parachute team leader said afterwards , according to the source			0
and she was clearly equally determined to call in favours from the top brass when it came to helping her troubled twin			0
@entity29 is under investigation by the @entity56 for her ' inappropriate emails ' sent to general @entity44 a judge last year awarded miss @entity22 ’s ex-husband custody of their three - year - old son , @entity85 , and ordered her to pay his legal bills of £ 221,000			1
judge @entity88 rejected her claims she had been a victim of domestic violence , criticising her ‘ pattern of misrepresentations about virtually everything ’			2
the judge also condemned mrs @entity29 ’s testimony that she had seen her brother - in - law push her sister down the stairs while clutching their baby , describing her as a ‘ patently biased and unreliable witness ’			0
miss @entity22 , a lawyer , filed for bankrupcty in april after racking up £ 1.9million in debt and moved in with her sister and brother - in - law @entity34 , a cancer surgeon			1
little more than a week after a terrorist attack on the @entity108 consulate in which the ambassador to @entity110 was killed in september , mrs @entity29 ’s friends in high places found time to back her sister in her legal battle			0
using his old title of ‘ general ’ and an envelope embossed with four gold stars , @entity1 , 60 , gushed in his letter to the court that ‘ @entity22 clearly dotes on her son and goes to great lengths – and great expense – to spend quality time with him ’			1
whenever he and his wife , @entity124 , had seen the pair , including when they had them over at @entity128 last year , they had seen a ‘ very loving relationship ’			0
writing two days later on september 22 , @entity44 – @entity1 ’s deputy when they were stationed at @entity132 on @entity133 – said : ‘ @entity22 clearly loves @entity85 and cherishes each and every opportunity she has to spend time with him			1
’ @entity1 resigned last friday after admitting he had been having an affair with his biographer , @entity138			2
the pair ’s relationship was exposed after mrs @entity29 went to the @entity141 after receiving anonymous harassing emails			0
investigators discovered not only that they had come from mrs @entity138 but also that she was having an affair with the @entity2 chief.but they also learnt that mrs @entity29 was exchanging thousands of what officials call ‘ potentially inappropriate ’ emails with @entity44 , who is married with two children			1
in fact , he , too , had been emailed by @entity138 who warned him to stay clear of mrs @entity29 as she was a ‘ seductress ’			0
@entity44 ’s appointment as @entity155 of @entity157 forces in @entity158 has been put on hold while the @entity56 investigates the extent of his relationship with mrs @entity29			2
yesterday @entity162 said the pair became involved in much more than ‘ flirtatious ’ behaviour and quoted an insider saying the messages they exchanged were the ‘ equivalent of phone sex over email ’			0
last night @entity171 said he was ‘ withholding judgment ’ on whether the @entity141 should have told the @entity173 much earlier about its @entity1 inquiry			2
praising his ‘ extraordinary service ’ to his country , mr @entity171 added : ‘ by his own assessment , he did not meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the @entity2			0

@entity2 chief @entity1 and general @entity44 wrote letters of support for ' unstable ' @entity22
