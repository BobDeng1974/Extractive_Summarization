' they need to be fairly and fully investigated and i welcome this independent and formal scrutiny			0
' @entity91 , chairwoman of the @entity92 , said : ' obviously i ’m very , very pleased			0
i ’m absolutely delighted that he ’s going			2
' but then he ’ll be going on his full pension , and i ’d like to know the full reasons why he ’s choosing to retire as soon as this			0
' mrs @entity91 , whose 18 - year - old son @entity99 died in the tragedy , said : ' why did n’t he stay , then , until the @entity41 came out with their investigation ? ' but he ’s decided to leave			2
i ’m not arguing against it , because i ’m thrilled that he is going			0
' sir @entity1 , who began his policing career in @entity106 , has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the disaster			1

' he should leave with nothing , like he tried to leave the families			0
' questions about sir @entity1 ’s role in the investigation of the tragedy have dogged him as he has risen through the higher ranks of the police - most notably when there were protests from the families of those who died when he became chief constable of @entity144 in 1998			1
undeterred by this opposition , sir @entity1 stayed on in @entity25 for six years and was even named an honorary fellow of the city ’s @entity147			1
@entity25 fans held up a @entity7 banner before the match between @entity25 and @entity152 after the explosive report support : @entity25 fans hold up a mosiac spelling out ' justice ' and ' the truth ' after report findings after retiring from the police in 2004 to become the chief executive of @entity162 , a firm which offered training to police forces , he was knighted for services to policing in 2006			1
returning to an active role in the police and @entity73 , sir @entity1 became @entity3 ’s chief constable in january 2007 and was designated the officer responsible for overseeing policing of domestic extremism			1
last month he was singled out as the most senior serving policeman allegedly involved in a ' black propaganda ' campaign that followed the 1989 stadium disaster			1
he was part of a @entity20 unit which tried to ensure the force was exonerated over the tragedy and fans were put in the spotlight			2
the report revealed that as a chief inspector he produced a video for mps which highlighted how a pitch invasion was ' thought ' to have happened			0

@entity25 mp @entity193 said the unit he was part of was nothing more than a ' black propaganda ' campaign			1
but sir @entity1 insisted he had ' nothing to hide ' as a clamour for him to resign intensified but sparked fresh fury by placing some blame on fans			1
he stressed he had played no role in changing officers ' accounts of what happened , saying : ' i never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered			0
' he pointed out that he had been off - duty and attended the fateful @entity211 semi-final match as a fan , immediately joining the police effort			0
in 1998 , several police authority members quit when sir @entity1 was made chief of @entity144 over his role in preparing the police response to @entity7			2
in april 2010 , sir @entity1 raised eyebrows by saying that he was not worth his bumper pay and pension package			2
