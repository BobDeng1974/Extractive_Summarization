by @entity0 published : 20:22 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 25 july 2012 scientists have raised fears of rising sea levels after pictures showed @entity6 's ice sheet has melted over a larger area than at any time in more than 30 years of satellite observations			1
almost the entire ice cover of @entity6 has experienced some melting at its surface this month , according to data collected by three independent satellites			1
the findings , described as ' unprecedented ' by @entity15 , have stunned scientists , who say only about half of the ice sheet melts naturally during an average summer			1
unprecedented : these maps show the extent of surface melt over @entity6 's ice sheet on july 8 ( left ) and july 12 ( right ) one expert even suspected that the satellites had made a mistake at first , so surprising were the results			1
@entity26 , of @entity15 's @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , was analysing radar data from the @entity32 's ( @entity32 ) @entity33 satellite last week when he noticed that most of @entity6 appeared to have undergone surface melting			1
he said : ' this was so extraordinary that at first i questioned the result - was this real or was it due to a data error ? ' mr @entity26 checked the @entity33 's findings against pictures taken by other satellites , belonging to @entity15 and the @entity43			0
scientists found that the melting had spread quickly - from about 40 per cent of the ice sheet on july 8 to about 97 per cent four days later			1
@entity15 has released colour - coded maps showing the dramatic change between july 8 and july 12			0
areas in dark pink show where two or three satellites found evidence of melting			2
areas in light pink show where one satellite found evidence of melting			0
@entity6 has seen an unusual weather pattern since the end of may			2
the extreme melting coincided with the last of a series of strong ridges of warm air , described by @entity15 as ' heat domes '			2
@entity66 , a climatologist at the @entity67 , said : ' each successive ridge has been stronger than the previous one			0
' concerning : icebergs float in a bay off @entity72 , @entity6 , in 2007			0
satellite pictures have shown ' unprecedenting ' melting of the ice sheet this month the latest heat dome started to move over @entity6 on july 8 , staying over the ice sheet about three days later			1
by july 16 , it had begun to dissipate			0
even the area around @entity80 in central @entity6 , which at two miles above sea level is near the highest point of the ice sheet , showed signs of melting			1
such pronounced melting at @entity87 and across the ice sheet has not occurred since 1889 , according to ice cores analysed by @entity90 at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93			1
a @entity95 weather station at @entity87 confirmed air temperatures hovered above or within a degree of freezing for several hours on july 11 and 12			0
@entity98 , a glaciologist and a member of the research team analysing the satellite data , said : ' ice cores from @entity87 show that melting events of this type occur about once every 150 years on average			0
' with the last one happening in 1889 , this event is right on time , but if we continue to observe melting events like this in upcoming years , it will be worrisome			0
' @entity15 's cryosphere program manager , @entity110 , told the @entity111 that this month 's extreme melting could be part of a natural variation			0
but he added : ' we have abundant evidence that @entity6 is losing ice , probably because of global warming , and it 's significantly contributing to sea level rise			2
' fears : @entity15 scientists say they have ' abundant evidence ' that @entity6 is losing ice , probably because of global warming			2

three independent satellites find that almost the entire ice cover has seen melting at the surface this month
melting has spread rapidly , from affecting 40 per cent of the ice sheet to 97 per cent within a week
it comes as @entity6 sees unusual ' heat dome ' weather patterns
