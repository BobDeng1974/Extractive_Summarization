there are n’t many coaches whose team barely musters a noticeable support for home games and has the measly total of only five home goals all season — whose predecessor was just ‘ sold ’ for € 4million to a @entity10 team — who is sufficiently confident the day before facing the reigning @entity13 champions to claim : ‘ i really do n’t think i ’m far off coaching @entity14 ’			2
but the fact is that @entity16 is a bit special			2
a quality which will need to be flooding out of him like a river in spate if the beleaguered mob he ’s just taken charge of , @entity25 , are not to feel the whiplash of a displeased @entity14 side facing their third derby match in less than a fortnight			1
perhaps , if your memory is elephantine , you may recall @entity16 for his @entity25 side beating the @entity33 of @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 just short of 10 years ago during his previous single season in charge of this club			1
much more likely is that you know @entity16 for having seeded the @entity45 revolution			1
goalkeeper @entity46 was given his big break at @entity45 by @entity16 he gave @entity48 his debut , was brave enough to establish 19 - year - old @entity46 as first - choice keeper , won the @entity51 in 2010 , knocking out @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and then beating @entity55 in the final — plus his @entity57 then defeated treble - holders @entity58 for the @entity60			1
does n’t it always ? but notwithstanding @entity66 ’s brilliance , the @entity64 largely inherited a ‘ made ’ squad when he succeeded @entity16 three years ago			1
so , the 49 - year - old carries a bit of @entity71 football baggage into this lunchtime ’s derby match at the @entity74 ( @entity75 5 , 10.55am )			1
but the fact is that he ’s actually a minor royal in the @entity14 dynasty			2
@entity16 ’s father ( @entity79 ) was a quadruple @entity81 title - winner with the almighty @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and del @entity16 ’s mother ( @entity88 ) and aunt ( ‘ @entity90 ’ ) were both massively famous singers , flamenco dancers and movie stars			2
@entity94 striker @entity48 was another player to flourish under @entity16 at @entity45 and as far as children of the 1960 ’s go , there could barely be a better godfather than @entity99 — the legendary @entity100 himself			1
@entity16 ’s cousins all became famous in music , television or cinema , such that the family @entity106 / @entity16 must , at times , have felt that ‘ @entity81 belongs to us ... @entity81 loves us ’			2
little wonder that @entity16 is n’t short of some natural assurance			2
his stock is both gypsy , and thoroughbred — his life has been spent in the elite			0
not spent without trials and tribulations however			0
just as he was performing well enough as a full - back to be picked for @entity81 [ he went to @entity116 ’ 90 ] @entity45 tried to sign him from @entity53 — coached by none other than @entity99			0
things went a bit @entity120 as @entity99 warned @entity53 he ’d quit if they sold the boy			0
it became a national cause célèbre as @entity16 ’s mother @entity88 put in a two - footed , studs - up challenge — demanding to her husband ’s best pal , @entity99 , that her son should be allowed to better himself ( and return to the family home in @entity81 ’s capital )			0
‘ that row over @entity45 trying to sign me really stunned me , ’ @entity16 revealed years later			1
‘ my mother got involved in the furore because i was n’t around and she felt someone had to say something			0
because she ’s so famous , it had more repercussions			0
@entity25 coach @entity16 will seek to beat @entity14 in sunday 's derby match ‘ i try to dodge the celebrity magazines which are meat and drink to the rest of my family			1
’ then , when @entity16 won his only trophy as @entity14 ’s starting right - back , it was blemished with family tragedy			1
it was 20 years ago and @entity83 were about to break @entity151 ’s ‘ @entity151 ’ run of four straight championships under @entity153			0
just at that theoretically sweet moment his aunt , @entity154 , died of cancer			0
massive parts of the nation just adored her , so @entity81 had barely finished mourning , 15 days later , when her son @entity159 ( @entity16 ’s cousin ) was found dead at home from a drug and alcohol overdose			0
the @entity81 title which @entity14 and @entity16 lifted the following week was a sombre triumph for him			1
perhaps being pitted against the biggest club of his career at this stage is too soon to expect a win			0
but if he really expects to coach @entity83 in the near future , then what better way to attract their attention ?			0

@entity16 takes charge of @entity25 for sunday 's derby match
in his previous spell in charge he *masterminded* victory over @entity14 side featuring @entity37 and @entity38
@entity66 largely inherited @entity16 ' squad at @entity45
