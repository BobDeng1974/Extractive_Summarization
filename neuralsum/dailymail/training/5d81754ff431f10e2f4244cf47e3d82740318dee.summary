@entity0 has launched an extraordinary attack on the @entity3 government , accusing ministers of adopting a policy to ' drown more refugees in the @entity7 '			2
the former @entity9 leader condemned the decision to end support for rescue operations for illegal immigrants because it might encourage more people to attempt the dangerous crossing from @entity16			1
he called for the @entity17 to be sent in to target the people traffickers charging more than £ 2,000 per person for a place on a rickety boat			1
@entity0 condemned the government 's refusal to back rescue operations in the @entity7 , but @entity26 minister @entity25 insisted the human traffickers were to blame for deaths more than 100,000 have reached @entity29 since the turn of the year and some 2,000 have died trying , according to the @entity32 refugee body @entity31			1
the @entity29 mission in the @entity7 has been wound up after rescuing tens of thousands of people , but @entity3 insists offering help will act as a ' pull factor ' to others to seek refuge in @entity39			1
the @entity3 government claims there are between 300,000 and 600,000 people in @entity43 waiting to make a crossing , but the numbers have started to fall			2
but in a short debate in @entity47 , @entity0 said ministers were trying to defend ' a completely untenable position '			0
he added : ' why does the government 's policy seem to be to support measures that can have only one result - to drown more refugees in the @entity7 - rather than a policy whose aim is to lock up more people traffickers ? ' only one has ever been arrested — in @entity59 , which is one of the main departure countries			1
' he urged the government to deploy the @entity17 in a targeted mission to root out those responsible for the trade in vulnerable people			1
' a few years ago when @entity68 used all the resources at their disposal , including @entity71 , to rid the @entity72 of drug smugglers			0
' why can we not do the same thing to rid the @entity7 of people traffickers ? ' the @entity26 insisted that the government is working closely with other @entity79 member states to address the ' distressing situation '			2
the @entity29 government has stopped search and rescue operations after thousands were picked up this year , including 600 would - be immigrants rescued from the @entity7 in a single weekend in september @entity26 minister @entity25 said : ' we need to tackle the traffickers who are exploiting this situation by placing vulnerable people in unseaworthy vessels and setting them afloat in exchange for € 2,000 or € 3,000 a head			1
' that is absolutely morally outrageous			0
they are responsible for the deaths			0
' home secretary @entity93 is due to meet @entity29 ministers to discuss the crisis , and will consider requests for more help from @entity3			2
@entity98 - the @entity79 agency dealing with border security – is using drones to track attempts to cross the sea from above			0
last month the @entity103 ruled out search and rescue operations in the @entity7 , claiming that they ' create an unintended ' pull factor ' , encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths ' but the stance was repeatedly criticised in the lords yesterday			1
@entity111 said : ' it has become clearly unacceptable to allow some people to drown to deter others from risking their lives at sea			2
' and shadow @entity26 minister @entity117 of @entity118 asked lord @entity25 : ' do you really believe this needless loss of life - people drowning in the @entity7 - will ever act as a deterrent to the criminals drowning people or those desperate enough to get into small boats ? ' in march this year around 2,128 migrants were rescued off the coast of @entity29 in two different operations conducted by the @entity130 lord @entity25 told peers : ' there are very early figures but there is some evidence from @entity98 in a brief that i have received in the last 48 hours that there is a turning in the trend here			1
' remember it went up from 70,000 a year to 150,000 , deaths went up from 700 to 3,000			0
we think that there are between 300,000 and 600,000 in @entity43 waiting to make the crossing			0
' the indications are that in october the numbers fell			0
there could be other reasons for that , we are following it very closely , but this is something we take very , very seriously indeed			0
' the @entity153 has warned that the @entity3 's stance will contribute to more people ' needlessly and shamefully dying on @entity39 's doorstep ' .			0
