by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 21:13 est , 5 august 2013 @entity2 scientists have identified an ‘ angry mum ’ gene that makes some mothers lash out or shout at their children			1
the study revealed women who carry a variant of the protein are predisposed to hitting or shouting at children during an economic downturn			2
scientists discovered ‘ harsh parenting ’ increased during the @entity18 in the @entity2 between 2007 and 2009 , particularly amongst women with the so - called ‘ sensitive ’ mutation of a gene that regulates moods			2
a study by @entity20 revealed women who carry a variant of the protein are predisposed to hitting or shouting at children during an economic downturn just over half the parents taking part in the study had the gene known as @entity29 that controls dopamine , a behaviour and mood - regulating chemical in the brain			1
dr @entity34 , of @entity20 , said : ' it ’s commonly thought economic hardship within families leads to stress which - in turn - leads to deterioration of parenting quality			2
' but these findings show an economic downturn in the larger community can adversely affect parenting - regardless of the conditions individual families face			1
' the study , published in proceedings of the @entity49 , said the effect is only found in mothers who carry the gene version that makes them more likely to react to their environment			1
deteriorating financial conditions had no effect on the level of harsh parenting of mothers without the sensitive gene			0
but mothers with it displayed less aggressive parenting when the economy was improving compared with those without it			0
an economic downturn in the larger community can adversely affect parenting - regardless of the conditions individual families face , according to the research which was based on data from 5,000 children born in 20 large @entity2 cities including @entity73 ( pictured ) between 1998 and 2000 professor @entity74 , of @entity75 , said : ' this finding provides further evidence in favour of the orchid - dandelion hypothesis that humans with sensitive genes - like orchids - wilt or die in poor environments but flourish in rich environments whereas dandelions survive in poor and rich environments			1
' the research was based on data from the @entity88 ( @entity89 ) involving almost 5,000 children born in 20 large @entity2 cities between 1998 and 2000			1
mothers were interviewed shortly after giving birth and when the child was about one , three , five and nine years old			0
data on harsh parenting was collected when the child was three , five and nine with saliva dna samples collected from 2,600 mothers and children on the final occasion			0
@entity102 parenting was measured using ten items from the commonly used @entity109 - five measuring psychological issues such as shouts and threats and the others corporal punishment like spanking or slapping			2

the results showed harsh parenting was n't linked with high levels of unemployment the researchers also analysed economic conditions in each of the cities where the mothers lived using monthly unemployment rates and consumer surveys			1
the results showed that contrary to common perceptions , harsh parenting was not linked with high levels of unemployment among those studied			1
rather it was connected with increases in a city ’s unemployment rate and declines in national consumer confidence			0
the researchers concluded the fear of losing one 's job because of deteriorating economic conditions , is more likely to cause harsh parenting than poor economic conditions or even economic hardship that a family faces			0
professor @entity141 , of @entity142 , said : ' people can adjust to difficult circumstances once they know what to expect - whereas fear or uncertainty about the future is more difficult to deal with			0
' the researchers also sought to determine if the response varied by genetic make - up			0
mothers with the ‘ sensitive ’ @entity29 gene were significantly more likely to engage in harsh parenting under deteriorating local economic conditions and declines in consumer confidence .			0

@entity2 scientists found an economic downturn in the larger community can adversely affect parenting - regardless of individual family conditions
the study by @entity20 found the effect is only seen in mothers who carry a gene that makes them more likely to react to their environment
@entity102 parenting was not linked with high levels of unemployment among the 2,600 mothers studied in 20 large @entity2 cities
