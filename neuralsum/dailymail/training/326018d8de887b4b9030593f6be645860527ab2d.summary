by @entity0 published : 21:00 est , 26 august 2012 updated : 11:04 est , 27 august 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 poster girls are already being lined up for lucrative sponsorship contracts ahead of the @entity5			1
female athletes could earn up to £ 100,000 in sponsorship and media deals , echoing the success of olympians such as @entity11 and @entity12			1
during previous games , less than a dozen of the most successful @entity2 are thought to have landed deals with major sponsors			1
but experts said the @entity18 , which begins on wednesday , is about to change all that			1
high hopes : sprinter and long jumper @entity21 ( left ) and track and road cyclist @entity25 golden moments : torchbearer @entity27 lights the @entity28 outside @entity29 in @entity30 , left , and wheelchair basketball player @entity31 warms up for the @entity14 on the court , right @entity33 , director of sports marketing agency @entity34 , said he expected up to a dozen @entity3 paralympians to reach £ 100,000 in revenue , if they achieved gold medal success in the next two weeks			1
while it is still a long way off the £ 5million that heptathlete @entity41 is anticipated to earn over the next few months , it does reflect the surging level of interest in the @entity18			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ @entity2 will benefit hugely from the success of the @entity45			1
‘ for many , it will be the first time they have experienced such high media coverage or been offered big sponsorship deals			1
‘ in previous @entity14 , only a handful have attracted high levels of sponsorship , but now quite a few have the chance to make a lot of money			1
’ track cyclist and seven - times @entity2 gold medallist @entity25 , 34 , is said to be top of the list			1
spirit of champions : the official @entity63 team photo , featuring all 600 athletes and staff another athlete expected to do well is ‘ blade runner ’ @entity21 , 27 , who lost part of a leg in a speedboat accident			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ sponsors will always look for the glamorous competitors , but they will also look for those who have faced the hardest challenges to get to the @entity18 or for the biggest personalities			1
' as with the @entity45 , it is not just about medals , it is about the story behind the athletes and stand - out characters			1
‘ but unlike the @entity45 , where the big names were already known , the sponsors may sit back and wait to see who does well or who captures the public ’s imagination before they offer the big sponsorship deals			1
’ here , the @entity90 profiles the athletes who are likely to become the @entity3 golden girls of the 2012 @entity18 : rowers @entity93 and @entity95 – nicknamed the ' two blondes in a boat ' – will compete in the mixed coxed fours and are strong medal contenders			1

' @entity100 , who is in the minimal disability boat , said she ' can not wait ' for the @entity14 to begin			1

' @entity95 , 29 , a partially sighted jewellery designer , said : ' in 2004 @entity63 needed girls in the @entity18 crew and i ticked all the boxes – i was quite tall , i had tried rowing at college and i was visually impaired			2
