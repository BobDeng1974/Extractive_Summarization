the eye is one of the most complex yet delicate part of the human body			2
now engineers claim to have designed a range of synthetic eyes that may one day let us replace and even enhance our own sense of vision			1
@entity12 bio-designers @entity10 has unveiled project is has been working on to @entity15 organic tissues to produce working body parts that can replace the eyes of people suffering from disease			1
it could mean rather than getting glasses to correct their vision , people would be able to replace their entire eye			1
the @entity25 concept ( above ) is designed to replace and even enhance the vision compared to a normal eye the group plan to combine the biological tissue with microscopic wireless technology to provide additional functions and give super human eyesight			1
while currently still just a concept , the project raises the prospect of what bio-engineering may make possible in years to come			1
the team behind @entity10 say their synthetic eyes , which include lenses that improves the image sharpness and can put filters over the vision , could be available by 2027			1
scientists claim to have made a ' giant leap ' towards creating 3d organs that could be simply printed out in hospitals when needed for a transplant			0
an international team have created the first organs that include a full vascular network for transporting blood through organs			0
they say it could even allows organs damaged by cancer to simply replaced			0
scientists from the @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 have now bio-printed artificial vascular networks mimicking the body 's circulatory system that are necessary for growing large complex tissues			2
using a high - tech ' bio-printer ' , the researchers fabricated a multitude of interconnected tiny fibres to serve as the mold for the artificial blood vessels			0
they then covered the @entity15 printed structure with a cell - rich protein - based material , which was solidified by applying light to it			0
lastly they removed the bio-printed fibres to leave behind a network of tiny channels coated with human endothelial cells , which self organised to form stable blood capillaries in less than a week			0
@entity87 and @entity88 , the two @entity12 designers leading the project , said : ' latest developments in bioprinting and biohacking let us imagine that in the near future it would be possible to easily print organic , functional body parts , allowing the human to replace defected districts or enhance standard performance			1
' this project is based on the idea of augmenting the sight sense , increasing the functionalities of the eye with ones currently handled by other body segments or external devices			0
' under @entity10 designs , patients with eye disease will inthe future be able to replace their eye with a synthetic one printed in a laboratory			1
for those looking to improve their vision , they could buy the ' enhance ' model that features a ' hyper retina ' to give 15/10 vision - significantly better than normal 20/20 vision			1
they say it could also include a gland that can filter the visual signal to the brain by producing vintage or black and white effects much like a modern camera			1
they say these could be turned on or off by swallowing a pill that alters the state of this gland			0
the @entity132 model adds a wifi connection that allows what the eye is seeing to be recorded and shared with others			0
it could also connect to external devices to act like a camera			0
they say a socket that connects the eye to the brain - which would require a surgical operation - would allow eyes to be interchangable			2
the synthetic eyes would come in three different models ( above ) according to the designs outlined by @entity10 @entity10 propose combining new technology like @entity150 with bioprinting to produce an enhanced bionic eye the concept sounds a little like something out of the science fiction hit @entity156 where bioengineers built new eyes for robotic replicants			1
writing on their website , mr @entity87 and mr @entity88 said : ' the installation of the @entity164 augmentations needs a first surgical operation aimed at installing the deck , the technology that actually connects the eye to the brain			2
' after that , augmented eyes can be easily interchanged by their own users without the need of additional surgery			0
' besides allowing to use different augmentations in different contexts , this system is suitable for easy hardware upgrade			0
' the designers say @entity180 could be used to create the tissues to create the complex eye stucture			2

@entity12 designers have unveiled a concept for a bio-printed synthetic eye
they say enhanced retina could increase vision to make images sharper
filtering signals to the brain to produce vintage or black and white effects
currently just a concept , the designers say it could be available by 2027
