by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob it is as close as you will come in @entity3 to an @entity4 receiving a compliment			1
@entity6 ! — the nation ’s leading sports newspaper — wanted to reflect the supreme performance of @entity10 against @entity11 last week			2
‘ from another planet ! ’ read its headline before listing , in order , the footballers it thought worthy of that accolade			0
out of this world : @entity10 has made a blistering start to this @entity21 , with four goals in three group games holy trinity : @entity10 and @entity25 honoured by @entity27 fans who compare the pair to gods no 1 was @entity30 ; no 2 @entity31 ; no 3 @entity32 ; no 4 @entity33 ( the @entity3 one ) ; no 5 @entity25 ; no 6 @entity10			1
‘ and before long @entity10 will overtake @entity25 as the greatest @entity4 of all time , ’ it went on			1
‘ as for overtaking the others , well that ’s just too much ! ’ but @entity10 knows — and all of @entity3 , even with their love for @entity40 , knows — that this is his @entity21			1
the tens of thousands of @entity4 who are colonising @entity3 this month , camping out in their cars on @entity44 or overwhelming @entity45 , are all anticipating it			2
video footage emerged of @entity11 goalkeeper @entity49 jokingly berating @entity51 referee @entity50 at half - time for giving @entity10 too many fouls			2
magician : @entity25 led @entity27 to the 1986 @entity21 and is still regarded more highly than @entity10 @entity55 amongst men : if @entity27 triumph in @entity58 may start to compare to the legend of @entity25 ‘ i know your job is difficult , ’ says @entity50 and @entity49 rolls his eyes and says : ‘ he ’s so good ! ’ never has a @entity21 been so accommodating for @entity10			1
‘ in 2006 and 2010 we already knew he had enormous talent , but he was still young and had to mature , ’ said @entity64 , the former @entity66 right - back			0
‘ in the last three to four years he has grown a lot and is now the captain and takes more responsibility			0
it seems that this will be @entity10 ’s @entity21			1
’ for now , @entity10 has to defer to the original great of @entity27			1
in @entity3 , @entity27 fans parade a banner that depicts @entity25 , the @entity78 and @entity10 ; all three are considered national icons but only one is referred to on the banner as ‘ @entity55 ’ and it ’s not the man from @entity85 ’s , nor the man from @entity87			1
and for some of the old school , the quietness , the modesty of @entity10 wil never compare with the charisma that surrounded @entity25			1
greatest ever : @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) are all - time greats , but @entity10 is approaching their level responsibility : becoming captain seems to have raised the @entity87 star 's game in international football supported : @entity10 is the centre of the @entity27 team , but needs them to provide him a solid base to shine @entity106 : @entity10 @entity107 , part of @entity27 ’s @entity110 - winning team and an assistant in 2010 when @entity25 managed @entity10 and the national team , said : ‘ @entity10 does not have anything on @entity25			1
' i love @entity10 and i would be happy if my son had one per cent of his ability , but @entity25 was unique			1
' there will never be anyone like him again , not even if @entity10 wins three @entity119 in succession or scores a bicycle kick from midfield			2
’ and there has been an equivocation about @entity10 in @entity27 in the past			1
after all , he left for @entity127 when he was just 13 and so has spent more of his life in @entity87 than in his homeland			0
the fact he could n’t replicate his @entity87 form with the national side has been held against him			0
he had to fight against those who claimed he did n’t care for his country as much as his club			0
the subtext was : ‘ unlike @entity25			2
’ the situation reached a nadir when @entity27 hosted the @entity139 , played poorly and were knocked out by @entity140 on penalties			2
on target : @entity10 hammers home his first goal against @entity11 to give @entity27 the lead double delight : a sumptuous free - kick made @entity10 the joint top scorer in the group stages in @entity3 @entity10 was asked why he did n’t sing the national anthem , the malicious explanation being that he did n’t know the words , and was whistled by the home crowd , prompting his father , @entity153 , to speak of the ‘ terrible pressure ’ his son endured playing for his country			1
that has dissipated in recent years , though @entity158 , another 1986 winner , touched on the darker elements of a nation placing so much faith in an individual			0
‘ as in politics , in @entity27 we are always looking for one man to save us , ’ wrote @entity158 in his newspaper column			0
‘ if @entity27 win the @entity21 , the people will crown him with laurels			1
otherwise , they will put a crown of thorns on him			0
’ that said , from the moment he announced himself at the @entity21 with his goal at the @entity174 , to his last - minute strike to salvage a win against @entity177 and his utter domination of the game against @entity11 , it has seemed likely he would lead an otherwise under - performing @entity27 side to the final			1
inspiration : @entity10 's performances have silenced critics who said he could not perform on the world stage @entity186 stand in their way on tuesday and after that , should they win , a potential quarter - final against @entity190 or the @entity191 and then a possible semi against @entity193			2
his team - mates are in little doubt as to his importance			0
‘ @entity10 is the best in the world — there is no question about that , ’ said @entity197			0
‘ when i am an old man i will tell my grandchildren bedtimes stories about when i won the @entity205 and hopefully about when i won the @entity21			0
' but most of all i will tell them that their grandfather used to play with @entity10 — that is an indication of how special he is			0
‘ the problem is that when @entity27 or @entity87 does n’t play well , the press think it is easy to blame @entity10			1
’ surrounded : no defence has yet managed to shackle the @entity216 star , and @entity186 have a tough ask right now , this is not an issue			0
he is absolutely rising to the occasion ; it is his team - mates who have yet to impress			0
defensively they have looked shocking			0
‘ he can not win every game alone , ’ said former @entity27 forward @entity223			2
‘ he needs the team to defend			0
’ but if the defenders can defend and the midfielders provide the ballast , then perhaps @entity10 can lead them to their first @entity21 triumph since 1986			1
then he might even knock @entity32 and @entity33 off that @entity3 list ; not @entity31 and @entity30 though — that really would be too much .			0

@entity10 scored four times in @entity235 stages
@entity3 sports paper names him sixth greatest player ever
@entity27 fans still see @entity25 as their number one
but win the @entity21 and @entity10 could compare to ' @entity243 '
