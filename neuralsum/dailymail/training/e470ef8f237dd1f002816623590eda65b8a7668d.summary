' but when i reached 23 weeks i was told they would n't give me steroids because they felt i would miscarry			0
' it felt like they had given up			0
' ms @entity11 knew of someone at the @entity88 in nearby @entity89 who had been given steroids in a similar situation			2

within 20 minutes of the transfer @entity11 was given a steroid injection ms @entity11 claims that @entity106 initially refused to the transfer , saying ms @entity11 was in active labour but they relented after agreeing that the baby 's head was not engaged			1
within 20 minutes of getting there ms @entity11 was given a steroid injection			2
she added : ' looking back , i ca n't believe two hospitals in the same area could have such a different approach			0
' a week later the mother developed blood poisoning and had to have a caesarian section and @entity0 was born on december 18 - four months ahead of her due date of april 7			1
ms @entity11 recalled : ' they did n't think @entity0 would survive because she 'd had no waters for five weeks			1
ms @entity11 ( pictured with @entity0 ) added : ' looking back , i ca n't believe two hospitals in the same area could have such a different approach			1
a week later she developed blood poisoning and had to have a caesarian section and @entity0 was born on december 18 - four months ahead of her due date of april 7 ' there was a one per cent chance			1
they thought they would give her to us and she would pass away			0
but she was born crying			0
they could n't believe it			0
' she was so tiny and for the first couple of days @entity12 brought me pictures because i could n't see her			0
' it was touch and go and we were warned that sometimes there are two weeks or so when things seem to go well , but then they can go downhill			0
' instead @entity0 kept improving , and after eight weeks was transferred back to @entity38 and put in the special care baby unit			1
ms @entity11 said ' they thought she would pass away			2
for the first couple of days @entity12 ( pictured ) brought me pictures because i could n't see her '			0
it was touch and go and we were warned that sometimes there are two weeks or so when things seem to go well , but then they can go downhill			0
' but it was then that the first problems emerged with her lungs which medics allegedly down - @entity155 began bottle feeding but her mother feared she was taking milk into her lungs			1
despite her concerns the hospital discharged her after 100 days - with her baby still choking and coughing while feeding			1
ms @entity11 said : ' she was getting worse			2
one day , going to @entity38 , she stopped breathing in the car			0
i had to resuscitate her			0
' they told us it was bronchiolitis , that she 'd caught a bug			0
she seemed to pick up on antibiotics			0
i said i was concerned again about aspiration , they said again it was a bug			0
' @entity0 stopped breathing a second time and @entity12 had to resuscitate her			2
@entity11 again repeated her concerns about her taking milk into her lungs , but says she was again told the baby had an infection			2
instead @entity0 kept improving , and after eight weeks was transferred back to @entity106 and put in the special care baby unit but @entity0 's condition worsened and she was transferred to specialists at the @entity184 in @entity185			1
@entity11 said : ' one of her lungs had collapsed			0
she was very poorly , and they prepared us for the worst			0
' but once more @entity0 defied the odds and was returned home via @entity38			1
' a couple of weeks later we had a phone call from @entity184 asking how she was , ' said ms @entity11			2
' we went down there and they were quite shocked at the state of her lung			0
it was still partly collapsed			0
fighter : @entity0 ( pictured with her mother , father and big sister ) is now doing well although she is still battling lung and feeding complications because of her early birth ' they asked if i had any concerns and i said i thought she was aspirating - taking milk into her lungs			1
they tested her and stopped the bottle feeding straightaway			0
' @entity0 was admitted and attempts were made to reinflate her lung			2
they were only partially successful and problems remain with her swallowing mechanism , and she may eventually require a feeding tube to be fitted into her stomach			0
ms @entity11 said : ' we do n't know if her lung will fully reflate			2
if my concerns had been listened to at the beginning , this could have been avoided			0
' ms @entity11 and mr @entity64 are now preparing a complaint to the @entity225 over the handling of @entity0 's case			1
