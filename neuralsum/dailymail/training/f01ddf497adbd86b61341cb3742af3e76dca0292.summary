@entity0 believes @entity1 needed a ' change of scenery ' from @entity4 , but the @entity5 would have preferred if the @entity7 striker had moved to @entity8 rather than @entity9			1
@entity1 agreed a two - year loan move to @entity9 - and not @entity0 's former team @entity8 - after a challenging three - and - a - half - years at @entity11 following his Â£ 50million arrival from @entity13 in january 2011			1
' i 'm an @entity15 and i would have preferred if he 'd gone to @entity8 , ' @entity4 boss @entity0 told reporters at a @entity18 coaching seminar in @entity19			1
what i can say about @entity1 is that as a person and a professional , there is nothing to doubt about him			2
' he 's a fantastic boy and a great professional			0
however , he needed a change of scenery			0
' @entity1 has officially begun life as an @entity9 player , pictured in his first training session for the @entity37 giants			2
the @entity39 striker , who made 110 league appearances for @entity4 after joining the west @entity42 club , fell out of favour with @entity0 and was shipped out on loan last week for the remaining two years of his contract			1
run out of puff : @entity1 , whose nickname is @entity1 , had a poor @entity4 career after his brilliance at @entity50 upon joining @entity9 last friday , @entity1 said of the move : ' i feel good , mentally strong			1
when everything goes well , you have more will power			0
i 'm happy to train			0
' ' i ca n't wait to see the red and black supporters , to score for them and to win many titles			0
' @entity58 will wear the number nine shirt for his new club , something the now - @entity9 man knows has a lot of history			1
' it 's an honour to wear the number nine jersey			0
( it ) has been worn by some of @entity9 's great champions , i hope to be up there with them			2

@entity1 has left @entity4 for @entity9 on a two - year loan
@entity0 let @entity1 leave @entity11 after three - and - a - half years
@entity0 is a former @entity8 manager and *admitted* he would rather have let @entity58 join his former club
