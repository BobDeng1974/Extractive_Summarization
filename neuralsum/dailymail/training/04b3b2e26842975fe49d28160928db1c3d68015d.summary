from bitterns and badgers in @entity2 to bald eagles and bears in @entity5 – what a contrast ! i ’d just finished this year ’s @entity9 series at the @entity12 ’s @entity11 reserve in @entity2 so it was time for a family holiday , and there was a trip i ’d been looking forward to for a long time			1
over the years i ’ve been very spoiled , travelling all over the world filming wildlife , and there are certain places i put on my bucket list to go back to with my family – partner @entity23 and our son @entity24			2
@entity26 in @entity27 was one of them			1
grizzly bears gorge themselves on salmon in the water on @entity33 @entity34 with her partner @entity23 and son @entity24 at @entity26 it ’s a special place , a floating lodge in the middle of the wilderness , accessible only by boat or float plane and one of the best places in @entity27 to see grizzly bears			1
floating lodge @entity26 , @entity33 , is accessible only by boat or floating plane i ’d filmed there a couple of times , about ten years ago			1
the first time was for a show called @entity52			2
we went in august during the salmon run and filmed the grizzlies fishing and gorging in the river			2
it was an amazing sight			2
the second time was for a series called @entity60 when i was given two tasks – to see a grizzly baby and to get a ‘ kiss ’ from a hummingbird			2
@entity26 is a stopping point for @entity67 hummingbirds on migration and after a lot of patience , sitting next to a hummingbird feeder with red lipstick and sugar on my lips , i did actually complete that particular challenge			1
staying at @entity26 involves a three to five - day package , and with @entity27 such a long way to go – especially when you live in @entity79 , as we do – i left it to the @entity5 experts , @entity83 , to create a two - week trip around my ‘ bucket - list ’ destination			1
we started off in @entity33 , which is a fabulous city			1
it ’s easy to see why it ’s considered one of the top five places in the world to live			2
surrounded by beaches , ocean , mountains and greenery , it reminded us of @entity79			2
we stayed in @entity97 , near the beach and right beside @entity33 ’s famous @entity100			1
it ’s a stunning place , with nearly 1,000 acres of west coast rainforest , a smattering of manicured lawns , beautiful gardens , sports fields , an outdoor pool and a six - mile sea wall			0
it ’s a green playground in the heart of the city and incredibly well organised – to avoid accidents the sea wall has a one - way path for cyclists and another for runners			0
amazingly , everybody sticks to the rules ! the @entity118 in @entity33 's stunning @entity100 , almost 1,000 acres of green space and facilities in all we spent five days in @entity33 , two at the start of our trip and three at the end			1
we did a sightseeing tour the first day that took us to the @entity128 as well as @entity100 , @entity129 , @entity130 and a few other ‘ must - see ’ spots			0
it was very touristy but gave us a quick overview of the city			0
we particularly loved the suspension bridge , which is 450ft long , 230ft high and wonderfully wobbly ! we went on a boat ride in @entity137 , a trip up @entity139 – where we saw a very funny lumberjack show – hired bikes for a day and enjoyed a lovely harbour dinner cruise			2
@entity33 is an uncomplicated place to get around			1
people are incredibly friendly , and although cities are not really my thing , we really enjoyed it			0
apart from seeing grizzly bears , i wanted to show the family orcas , and @entity33 – across a sea strait from the city of @entity33 – is a great place to see them			1
there are two top spots , @entity156 , the main city on @entity33 , and @entity158 , a more quirky town , full of character and history , tucked away on the east coast of the island			1
the sea wall path is a one - way road for runners and cyclists ... and everyone abides by the rules @entity33 's oldest neighbourhood , @entity129 , is packed with restaurants , bars and tourists i had already been to @entity158 filming , so this time we went to @entity156			1
we went on two ‘ whale - watching ’ trips ( orcas – despite their other name , killer whales – are actually classed as dolphins ) and were amazed at the number of orcas we saw			0
these were residents , and can be regularly spotted between june and september			0
there are three resident pods around @entity156 with about 80 orcas in each			0
wildlife presenter @entity34 also visited the city @entity33 on the mainland and felt right at home with the hippy vibe of @entity189 in @entity27 our next stop was @entity189 and @entity191 on the west coast			1
our hotel at @entity191 , the @entity194 , was a stunning place right on the ocean			0
@entity189 is a chilled little town with lots of organic cafes , surfers , trees and beaches , and from here you can go on whale - watching boats and bear - watching trips			0
we went kayaking and black bear - watching and both trips were brilliant			0
@entity189 is the sort of place you could chill in for weeks , and if you get a pair of colourful baggy trousers , a few dreadlocks and drink lots of kale smoothies , you ’d fit in perfectly			0
( i felt very comfortable with the hippy vibe , as i ’ve never grown out of tie die since it was in fashion in the 1970s ! ) the next part of our trip was undoubtedly the highlight – our four - day package to @entity26			1
to get there we had to go by float plane , and it was hugely exciting getting on board			1
the trip made a memorable start to our adventure			2
the flight is a stunning half hour over the @entity233 , the largest piece of intact temperate forest left in the world			1
red cedar , western hemlock and sitka spruce , some of them 1,000 years old , reach high into the sky			0
of course logging is a continuous threat , and we saw plenty of it as we flew over , but these days , it ’s more controlled than it used to be , and much more sustainable			0
orcas , or killer whales even if they 're not actually whales ( they 're predatory dolphins ) frolic off @entity251 @entity34 flew a stunning half - hour in a float plane over the @entity233 to @entity26 as we arrived into @entity254 we could see the floating lodge that would be home for the next three nights			1
@entity26 used to be a fishing lodge but was bought in 1996 by the @entity260 family and is now run as a grizzly bear - watching paradise			1
the area has one of the largest concentrations of grizzly bears in @entity27 , with 30 to 40 bears			1
the population changes regularly depending on the number of new cubs the bears produce			0
during spring and summer , the bears feed on the cove ’s abundance of sedge grasses , berries and shellfish in the inter-tidal zone , and they are easy to spot			0
come august , the salmon run starts and the bears gorge on the abundance of rich protein , fattening themselves up ready for their winter hibernation			0
when you arrive at @entity26 they tell you it ’s ‘ @entity288 ’ – and they ’re not kidding			2
the three days are packed with activities you can choose from , and the days go ridiculously quickly			0
a good sign for bear watching that highlights the risk to visitors from the grizzlies we went on several estuary tours to watch bears and bald eagles , an inlet cruise to the waterfalls , which included getting soaked by going through the spray of one ( a highlight for @entity24 ) , a walk through the forest to ‘ above the clouds ’ , a kayak trip and a whole - day marine tour to spot orcas , seals , sea lions and humpback whales – and we saw plenty of them			2
@entity26 is a remote , dramatic and wild place , with towering snow - capped granite cliffs , waterfalls , glaciers and an abundance of wildlife			2
i ca n’t fault it : the food , rooms , organisation , staff and activities , were all brilliant and i could n’t help but fall in love with the place			0
you can feel the stress lifting off your shoulders as the fresh air and beautiful wilderness works its healing powers and you reconnect with nature			0
it ’s a place that pulls you back			0
so now @entity26 is off the @entity338 , where next ? @entity339 , the @entity340 , polar bears in the @entity342 , @entity343 to see the blue whales , @entity345 during the migration , diving on the @entity348 … the list goes on and hopefully i will slowly tick them off ! @entity5 specialist @entity83 ( discover - the - world.co.uk , 01737 214 291 ) offers a variety of wildlife - focused itineraries to @entity27			1
