@entity1 defender @entity0 has defended his decision to opt out of the @entity4 squad and insisted he has not snubbed his country			1
@entity0 decided to make himself unavailable for selection for the friendlies against @entity8 and @entity9 in order to spend more time settling in with his club , having moved to @entity13 from @entity14 in august			1
the 20 - year - old has lost his place in the starting line - up at the @entity19 club and @entity4 boss @entity20 agreed that @entity0 would be better served spending time on the training ground at @entity1			1
@entity0 scored in his first two @entity23 games , pictured ( centre ) celebrating against @entity25 @entity0 has represented @entity4 at @entity26 , 19 , 20 and 21 levels during his career so far ' i spoke to @entity20 and we were in complete agreement that it was the right thing to do , ' @entity0 told the club 's official website			1
' we had an open conversation and i think he was happy that i could be so honest with him			0
if he was n't completely fine with this then i would never have asked because i would never want to put him in a difficult position			0
' he has been fantastic with the whole situation and is really easy to talk to			0
i certainly would never want to give him or anyone else the wrong impression			0
@entity0 has made 13 appearances for @entity1 since arriving from @entity14 in the summer @entity0 pictured scoring on his @entity1 and @entity23 debut against @entity41 in august 2014 ' it is not a case that i do n't want to play for @entity4 , that could n't be further from the truth			1
' it has been a hectic start to the season for me and i have been delighted with the number of games i 've played so far			0
' obviously , i have just moved clubs and even though i represent @entity4 i have not lived here since i was really young so i am still adapting to my new environment			2
' i just felt that this two - week period gives me the opportunity to work on parts of my game that i have had problems with over the past two months , personal elements i need to work on both physically and on the football pitch that i think will make me a better player for both club and country in the long term			0
' it is far from a rest			0
this is a period where i can spend time at my new club and put a lot of work in to improve because during the season these opportunities do not come around too often for @entity1 or @entity4 because of the number of games we have to prepare for			1
' @entity0 also denied that he is not happy with being employed at right - back rather than centre - half			2
' i will never complain to a manager about what position i play as long as i am playing - i 'd even play centre - forward if i was asked to , ' he added .			2
