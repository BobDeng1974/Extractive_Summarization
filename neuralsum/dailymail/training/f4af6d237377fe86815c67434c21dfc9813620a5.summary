a remarkable photographic exhibition shows the family homes abandoned to decay on remote @entity3 islands because relatives can not bear to sell them			1
the haunting images , taken in the @entity7 by former @entity9 drummer @entity8 , show the properties slowly rotting away and remaining untouched and unchanged since the day the owner died			1
the homes , many of them original crofters ' cottages miles from the nearest road , appear frozen in time and some have become memorials to the dead of the islands			1
this crofters ' cottage on the @entity23 has clearly not been inhabited for years - the original stone chimneys can be seen , in contrast to the corrugated iron front , which would have been a relatively recent addition in order to keep out the bitter @entity29 winds this eerie photo was taken from inside a crofters ' cottage on the @entity33 - the broken glass can not hide the beautiful sea view in some cases , estate agents have received enquires to buy the properties but were ordered to turn them down as relatives cling on to past lives in crofting communities			2
now the stories behind the lost homes of @entity45 , @entity33 and other islands have been revealed with the help of social media and will form part of an exhibition in @entity51 which opens on january 4			1
the exhibition will feature pictures taken by @entity8 and @entity54 - based photographer @entity53 as well as a new concerto composed by former @entity57 winner @entity56			1
the hauntingly beautiful photographs show lives suspended in time with wedding pictures on mantelpieces , beds fully made and even dinner plates on the table			1
this picture shows the home of @entity67 and @entity68 on the @entity33			0
although the couple later left the island they continued to make an annual pilgrimage home to light the fire and sit in the front room together - it was @entity68 's last wish for the house to remain as it was the exterior of the @entity68 's home on the @entity33 - like many it had a corrugated iron casing to protect it from the harsh weather this photo shows a home in the @entity33 which still has a family 's sideboard , armchair and knick knacks despite the state of disrepair a living room in a cottage on the island of @entity23 - the chair with a favourite blanket thrown over it is still positioned in front of the tv mr @entity98 , who drummed on 70s hits such as @entity100 , stumbled across the hidden treasures when taking outdoor nighttime photographs around the @entity7			1
after entering the lost homes his interest soon turned to what was inside			2
' in some of them you see so many personal belongings that have been left behind , ' said @entity8			1
' there was one house with a suitcase on the bed and letters on the side board that have n't been opened			0
' this photo , titled ' @entity117 's @entity116 ' was taken on the small island of @entity119 which lies between @entity120 and the @entity121 this extraordinary image shows an abandoned crofters ' cottage on an unnamed island in the @entity7 with the sea behind it the kitchen in a cottage on the @entity33 remains a cheerful shade of yellow - a clock , mirror and framed photo add a personal touch he continued : ' in some houses it would be quite easy to spook yourself			1
' he teamed up with photographer @entity53 and soon the stories behind the mysterious houses started to emerged			0
mr @entity53 explained : ' the houses just exist as they are			0
people still have a very close emotional attachment			0
there are a lot of emotions tied up in them			0
' after getting in touch with relatives through @entity150 the story behind one of properties soon emerged			2
the house in @entity33 photographed by @entity8 still packed full of belongings was built by @entity67 and @entity68			1
this picture , taken on the @entity156 , shows an abandoned bedroom with a neatly folded blanket on the bed and a view of a nearby chapel the haunting images were taken on the islanda by former @entity9 drummer @entity8 ( pictured ) and are part of an exhibition this abandoned kitchen on @entity33 provides a snapshot in time - complete with old an fashioned teapot , a scythe and a framed photo although the couple left the island in their later years they continued to make an annual pilgrimage home to light the fire and sit in the front room together			1
' one of her [ @entity68 's ] last wishes was for the house to remain as it was , ' said @entity53			0
' there is still a very strong personal connection			0
' ' when the older generation die off there is no one to take the houses over , ' explained a @entity191 estate agent			0
the agent , who asked not to be named , said often people ask about old abandoned croft houses - ' where people are looking for that kind of lifestyle on the island '			2
this blue bedroom was photographed on @entity120 - a mirror remains over the fireplace and the paint is in suprisingly good condition this attic bedroom in a cottage on @entity45 has a beautiful original fireplace painted pink - which contrasts with the peeling walls and dusty floor the houses are often left to lie as they are by families after the death of the owners as a memorial to their loved ones but families often do n't want to sell because ' it 's the original family home '			1
' it 's sentimental family values			0
they have no intention to live in them at the moment , ' she said			0
the remote locations of a lot of the properties - many of which were built before the roads and are not accessible by car - mean they lay hidden out of sight			1
now they are at the mercy of the notorious @entity29 weather			0
' quite a few of these will disappear in the next five or ten years , ' said @entity53			0
he added : ' not all decay is bad decay			0
there is a lot of memories			0
' the exhibition ' away being ' is launched on january 4th in @entity245 at @entity246 , 151 @entity247 , @entity51			0

the inhabited islands have a total population of 27,400 - but there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands			2
the @entity7 became part of the @entity265 kingdom of the @entity29 , which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to @entity3 by the @entity267 in 1266			1
control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs , principal of whom were the @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276			2
the @entity277 of the 19th century , combined with the potato famine , had a devastating effect on many of the islands and it is only in recent years that population levels have stopped declining			2

the 1949 comedy @entity291 ! was filmed on the @entity121 , the southernmost inhabited island in the @entity7			2
