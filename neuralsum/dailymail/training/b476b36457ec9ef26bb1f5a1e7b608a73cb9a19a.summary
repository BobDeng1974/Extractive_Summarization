there are only two places to see a gallery of artwork depicting key events in the history of @entity7 intelligence services : the headquarters of the @entity9 and an out - of - the way museum in @entity12			1
tucked away in a neighborhood near @entity16 's airport , the @entity13 this month opened a gallery featuring 16 reproductions of original artwork donated to the @entity9 and displayed at its building in @entity22 , @entity23 based upon once - secret events that have since been declassified , the artwork provides a rare glimpse into decades of @entity7 spy work			1
one print depicts a b - 26 bomber flying over @entity29 during the failed @entity30 in 1961 , when @entity32 pilots flew for the @entity9 in a bid to overthrow the government of @entity35			1
art attack : air operations of @entity38 , an @entity9 proprietary , and its @entity9 contract pilots in support of @entity43 forces at @entity44 , @entity45 , in 1954 , during the final days of the conflict between the @entity43 and @entity47 new collection : @entity49 , executive director of the @entity13 in @entity16 , @entity12 viewing a new exhibit titled @entity51 , the art of intelligence another print shows @entity56 spy @entity55 tapping out code in occupied @entity43 , another a sunken @entity59 submarine being lifted off the ocean floor during a secret 1974 operation			1
the general public ca n't see the paintings at the spy agency - they are housed in a secure area frequented only by employees , official visitors and @entity68			1
but $ 7 will get anyone a ticket into the @entity12 museum to view both the prints and historic aircraft such as an old @entity59 helicopter , a @entity56 bomber pulled from a lake after crashing in @entity77 , and an a- 12 blackbird spy plane that once flew over @entity79 taking top - secret photographs			1
' it 's a one - of - a - kind deal , ' museum director @entity49 said			1
cast of a few , courage of a @entity83 : within 15 days of the attacks in the @entity7 , the first team of @entity9 officers was on the ground and operating in @entity88 to make contacts with opposition groups in the prelude to @entity92 seven days in the @entity93 : during the @entity94 , the @entity7 and the @entity59 competed for every advantage , including study of the @entity93 for its strategic value the exhibit , housed in a large room near old biplanes and aircraft engines , is titled ' @entity51 , @entity102			1
' artist @entity103 , who painted three commissioned works that hang in both the cloistered @entity9 museum and the @entity12 display , said he 's glad to have a new , less - exclusive audience for his art. he spoke at the opening of the @entity16 exhibit nov. 15 and said he was impressed by the display			2
' a print , as an artist , is never going to be fully representative of the original artwork , ' said @entity103 , of @entity115 , @entity116 ' but the prints are very high quality and representative of what you see at the agency			2
' @entity9 spokesman @entity125 said the agency is n't aware of any collection similar to the one in @entity16 , although the @entity9 displays some items on its website and has loaned some historical objects to nonprofit museums			0
@entity132 : on 12 january 1968 , four @entity134 an - 2 colt biplanes lifted off from an airfield in northeastern @entity136 and headed west toward @entity137			2
the aircraft were on a mission to destroy a @entity7 radar base that was guiding bombers in attacks against targets in @entity136			1
untouchable : only 15 were built , and only three would fly operational missions , ironically none over the @entity59 , before the aircraft were put in storage to be replaced by the @entity151 version of the plane , the @entity152 the @entity13 developed the exhibit through years of work after learning about the @entity9 gallery almost by chance			2
the works displayed at @entity9 headquarters were funded by private contributions and donated to the @entity9 , said @entity160 , who played a key role in helping put the collection together			0
while artist @entity163 was working on a piece for the @entity9 depicting a flight of the @entity167 spy plane now in @entity16 , he contacted the museum seeking photos of the aircraft to ensure historical accuracy , @entity49 said			2
museum staffers photographed the plane from multiple angles and sent the images to @entity163 , and @entity49 came away with the idea of developing a ' shadow ' collection of artwork to mirror the paintings housed at the @entity9			0
' some of the paintings include aircraft that we have here in the museum , like the a- 12 , ' @entity49 said			0
@entity185 ce soir : @entity55 was a @entity187 native who joined the @entity188 in the 1930s			0
at the outbreak of @entity56 , she eagerly joined the @entity192 @entity191 ( @entity191 ) to fight fascism the day the @entity194 came down : the world watched as the @entity196 fell on 9 november 1989 one artist led to another , @entity49 said , and the museum eventually secured prints of 16 of the 18 works displayed at @entity9 headquarters			0
some artists donated their works , @entity49 said , and others provide the art at deeply discounted prices			0
installed as a permanent exhibit at the @entity16 museum , the prints are accompanied both by written explanations of the historic events they depict and stories of how the artists completed the artwork			1
@entity103 said some of the works have been displayed outside @entity9 headquarters , including his painting of @entity55 sending secret messages in july 1944			0
the painting has been widely reproduced by publications , including @entity224			0
but so many works from the @entity9 collection have never before been available to so many people outside the agency 's walls , he said			0
' it 's certainly unique , ' @entity103 said .			0
