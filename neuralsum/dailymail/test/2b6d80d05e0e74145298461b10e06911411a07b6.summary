@entity0 was given the honour of leading @entity3 's victory song after helping them to a 30 - 20 win over @entity6 on his return from a six - month suspension			1
the 27 - year - old @entity9 forward did not get among the scorers but he did enough to impress coach @entity11 on his first appearance since being sent off in the @entity3 ' @entity14 defeat by @entity15 last october			1
' i thought he looked a bit serious , he 's not done anything for six months , ' @entity11 said			1
' i was a bit apprehensive for him but i thought he played really well - he belted a few people - and he led the song in the dressing room			1
@entity3 forward @entity0 takes on @entity6 's @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 ' it 's good to have him back			1
he 's been vilified in the press but he 's a really nice bloke			2
' the return of @entity29 dominated the build - up to the @entity32 derby while the half - time announcement that @entity34 is returning to the club on a four - year contract made it a night to remember for @entity11			1
' everything is great , ' @entity11 said			0
' it 's fantastic getting these players back			2
we should be very proud			0
it 's a great coup for us , it just shows we do some things right			2
' on the field , winger @entity43 provided the highlight with his second hat - trick of tries in five days as the @entity3 three times came from behind to secure a fourth win in five matches to consolidate third place in the table			1
@entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 also touched down while centre @entity56 scored two tries for the visitors , who had led 10 - 0 after 10 minutes			2
flower struggles to control the ball as @entity6 forward @entity63 lines him up the for hit ' it was a bit of tick and pass at times , which is disappointing , but i thought our attack was good , ' @entity11 said			1
' we gifted them a couple of tries with poor one - on - one misses but it was win at all costs for us and we got the win			1
' competition is driving up the skill levels and we 're going to get better			0
we are going to put a real complete performance in soon			0
' the defeat leaves @entity6 outside the top four but coach @entity82 was encouraged by his side 's performance			1
' it was a great effort by both teams and another great game , ' he said			0
' we produce some of the best games between us but , at the moment , we 're coming out on the wrong side of them			0
' i think both coaches will be looking for some improvement in defence but some special rugby league was played			0
sometimes you 've just got to go ' wow ' , it 's pretty hard to stop if they are going to go to those lengths to score tries			2
@entity43 crosses for a @entity3 try despite the attention of @entity104 ' the start of the second half really hurt us , it sapped our energy when they were throwing the ball around like a basketball			1
' the second half was n't great for us but we 're heading in the right sort of directions			0
it takes good performances to beat us			0
we 're much better than a few weeks ago			0
' @entity82 had mixed views on the performance of 19 - year - old @entity117 , who was making only his second appearance in @entity32			1
' his kicking game was sensational and i love it when he 's running with the ball but he got ragged around defensively at times , ' he said			2
' there are some aspects of his game he needs to step up			0
he learned some harsh lessons there tonight but he 's a good kid and will take things in his stride			0
