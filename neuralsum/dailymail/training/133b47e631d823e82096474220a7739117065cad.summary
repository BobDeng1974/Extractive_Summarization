' @entity8 said it had received messages of support from across the world			1

' it is a shame that it took a formal investigation and 18 months to force the apology we eventually received			2

' for such a serious issue and multiple breaches of conduct , bringing the council into disrepute , we did expect no less than this councillor 's resignation			2
' in a bid to justify what he said , mr @entity2 told the @entity160 : ' i had come to their stall after a long council meeting and i was probably a little bit het up as we had had some difficult debates			1

in a letter to the charity mr @entity2 said : ' i am writing to offer my wholehearted apologies for the offences these remarks have clearly caused			1

i ca n't believe that a councillor could even contemplate saying something like that even to stimulate debate			0
for me it is a resignation issue			0

i listened to one of the ladies on the @entity8 stall and came out with the comment			1
if only i had not said that			0

i did it to provoke a response and debate the issue of service costs provision			0
