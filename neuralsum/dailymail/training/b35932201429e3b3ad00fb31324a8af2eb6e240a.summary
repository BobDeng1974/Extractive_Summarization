by @entity0 more than 1,500 new cases of female genital mutilation have been revealed by a single @entity4 maternity unit and staff admit that other cases could have ' slipped through the net			2
' @entity8 in @entity9 has treated nearly 200 women a year since it started keeping records on the violent practice			1
while most of the 1,546 victims treated in the hospital 's specialist unit were born in @entity17 , disturbing statistics show that at least 11 were born in the @entity18 , where genital mutilation has been a crime since 1985			1
rudimentary tools are often used to perform the operations , like these found in @entity23 ( pictured left )			2
the procedure is often performed on young girls like nine - year - old @entity26 ( pictured right )			2
others were from @entity28 or @entity29 where the practice is common among some @entity32 communities			1
campaigners described the statistics as ' horrifying ' while staff at the hospital said it shows the tribal practice remains relatively common			1
@entity39 , a midwife at @entity40 's , warned that some staff were fearful of getting involved because they saw the backstreet operations as a cultural issue , rather than abuse			2
she said : ' the women we see have often faced years of pain and suffer flashbacks and other psychological problems			2
some of them are also terrified of childbirth because of what 's happened to them in the past			0
' ' some of them also do n't realise that @entity57 is wrong and are quite horrified when we tell them			0
' so we need to do much more to raise awareness and have a big educational campaign to stop it happening to more girls in the future			0
' one nurse at @entity8 said that some staff view @entity57 as a cultural issue rather than abuse @entity68 mp @entity67 , who chairs the all - party parliamentary group on female genital mutilation , said : ' many of these women are suffering the chronic health problems associated with @entity57			0
' yet again we are shown that there is a big problem to which our health and other public services must respond			0
' despite the high number of cases - 80 so far this year - nobody has yet been prosecuted for the practice			1
the @entity82 says it is studying five case files passed on by the @entity84			0
@entity85 , the @entity86 , has said it is only a matter of time before somebody is prosecuted but efforts are being hampered by victim 's unwillingness to come forward			0
female genital mutilation , or @entity57 , is a common practice among some @entity32 communities across the middle of @entity97 , including @entity17 , @entity29 , @entity98 and central @entity99			1
it is also present in @entity32 communities in @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and the @entity105 , among others			1
the operation involves cutting or removing female sexual tissue			0
it can also involve stitching using silk thread or catgut			0
the process is supposed to cleanse the woman of sexual impurity and victims can spend up to 40 days bound from the waist down while healing			1
the operation is usually performed on children or young girls before entering adolescence , though ages vary from community to community			0
given that most surgeries are performed by untrained women , commonly @entity127 of the girls or village matrons , risks include infection , pain , sterility , and death due to blood loss			0
due to the nature of the wounds , problems can occur later during childbirth			0
while the practice has been illegal in the @entity18 since 1985 , there have so far been no prosecutions due in part to victim 's reluctance to come forward , and also because some women do not recognise it as a crime			1
the practice is also specifically outlawed in @entity151 , @entity152 and some @entity154 states			1
in @entity97 several nations , including @entity17 , have made declarations against the practice though across the continent legislation is patchy and difficult to enforce .			1

the *barbaric* practice is most common in @entity32 areas of @entity97
however at least 11 of the victims were born in @entity18
the practice is illegal in the @entity18 but there have been no prosecutions
