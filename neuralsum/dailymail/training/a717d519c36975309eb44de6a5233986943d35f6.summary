’ earlier this month the @entity105 was criticised for not including a rate cap in its plans to regulate the industry			2
@entity144 , most parts of the @entity141 and some @entity143 countries have capped payday loan interest rates but the @entity105 has argued that such an approach could push borrowers into the hands of backstreet loan sharks .			0
