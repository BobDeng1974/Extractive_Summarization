the 650 miners at @entity9 near @entity10 , @entity11 , were given their marching orders after their shifts finished on wednesday night			1
heartless @entity15 bosses which runs the colliery told staff the pit was closing by text			1
it read : ' colleagues , i apologise for the late note			2
it is important to me that you hear from me personally that the company will formally announce the closure of @entity9 without chance of reprieve tomorrow [ thursday ] morning			1
marching orders : the 650 miners at @entity9 near @entity10 , @entity11 , were given their marching orders after their shifts finished on wednesday night ' a detailed update will follow			1
' the announcement came just three weeks after a fierce blaze destroyed equipment and left it with no more workable coal			1
yesterday workers expressed outrage at the way staff were told the devastating news			2
father - of - one @entity43 , 55 , from nearby @entity44 , who has worked at the mine since leaving school 38 years ago , said : ' it 's heart breaking			1
there have been grown men openly crying			1
' heartbreaking ' : the announcement came just three weeks after a fierce blaze destroyed equipment and left it with no more workable coal foreboding : miners said the fire meant all the coal - face equipment had been taken away and the shafts had been flooded , so it was ' fairly obvious ' that the pit would not re-open ' i 've seen blokes who have been here as long as me walking out with just a small bag in their hands , carrying tools they are never likely to use again			1
' we did fear the worst because of the serious extent of the fire , which is still burning			1
' all the coal - face equipment has gone and the shafts have been flooded , so it was fairly obvious that the pit would not re-open			2
' even so , the sudden closure has come as a devastating shock			2
' we were given the news on wednesday night by text message , which could , perhaps , have been done better			1
' but the management explained that they wanted everyone to know before the statement was released to the media			0
' historic : @entity9 is the last remaining mine in the @entity11 coalfields and will shut after 47 years of production as branch secretary of the @entity89 workers , mr @entity43 is now helping to negotiate redundancy terms for his 400 members			1
he said : ' things are a little uncertain at the moment			0
' the company is looking for financial support from the government to be able to make enhanced payments , which is what we are hoping for			0
' some men are being retained temporarily for the close - down operation and around 70 have been offered jobs at @entity103 in @entity104			0
' but otherwise , that 's it for the rest of us ; the end of the line			0
' coal mining is in my blood and it is so sad to see the way the industry has declined			0
' a spokesman for @entity4 coal said the texts had been sent as a last resort because they had not wanted employees to learn about the closure on the news			1
he said : ' we were determined that our employees should hear about the closure from the company rather than hear it on the news the next day			1
' i 'm bitterly disappointed that some have complained at being given advance warning that the mine was to close			0
' at briefing sessions immediately after the fire , we asked all employees to ensure we had their contact details so that we could update them on developments			2
' most provided email addresses and received a more detailed and compassionate message			0
' unfortunately , some did n't have email addresses and others chose not to provide one			0
' as such , they were contacted via their mobile phone - the route they had chosen to be contacted by			0
' i appreciate that this is a difficult time but we have worked extremely hard to keep our employees informed using the routes they chose			2
as such , this criticism is totally unjustified and very disappointing			0
' @entity146 , 47 , from @entity147 , @entity11 , has worked at the mine for 25 years			1
he said : ' it 's the only job i 've ever done and i really do n't know what the future will bring , although i am trying to remain positive			0
' mr @entity146 , 47 , was one of the 106 miners evacuated when the fire broke out 740 metres below the surface , on february 22			2
he added : ' the emergency procedure kicked in and everyone got out okay			0
' we all knew then what the final outcome would be			0
