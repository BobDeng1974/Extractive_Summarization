it seems the message is clear : men should give up control of the wine list , as they are twice as fearful of getting it wrong			2
choosing wine is one of the things that makes @entity9 most anxious – and men are far more uneasy about it than women			1
one in eight ( 11.5 per cent ) men say what makes them most uncomfortable - even more than spiders - is choosing wine in a restaurant or to go with food at a party			1
in terms of day - to - day events that make us feel uncomfortable , spiders still give us the creeps – almost one in six ( 16 per cent ) of us admit to being scared by them			1
there are things even more unnerving than spiders and wine but , thankfully , they are not likely to crop up quite as much			0
women are far less perturbed by wine choice , with 6 % saying it makes them most uncomfortable under pressure : both men and women said that job interviews were scary job interviews rank top for both women ( 28.5 per cent ) and men ( 24.5 per cent )			1
and , in a less formal context , both sexes hate being at a social occasion where they do n't know anyone – 25 per cent of women and 22 per cent of men rank this as the situation that makes them most uncomfortable			0
the research was commissioned by an online wine specialist @entity64 who surveyed 2,000 people to uncover how scared @entity26 were of ordering wine			0
@entity68 managing director of @entity21 said : ' as a social business we love delving in to what makes our the public tick			0
it 's unusual our survey showed that men find ordering wine more scary than spiders - but we aim to take the fear out of ordering wine and make it an enjoyable experience for customers			2

one in eight men say that choosing wine in a restaurant is uncomfortable
poll by @entity21 also revealed that that 16 % of us are scared of spiders
fear of job interviews ranked the *highest* in the study
