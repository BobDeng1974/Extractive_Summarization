scientists have worked out how an octopus avoids tying itself in knots			2
as if having eight long and bendy arms to control is n’t tricky enough , the octopus ’ brain does n’t know exactly where they are at any one time			1
yet , despite the potential confusion , the creature does n’t get all tangled up			1
this , say @entity13 scientists , is because its arms will stick to just about anything - other than themselves			1

stock image pictured octopuses are believed to be highly intelligent , more so than any other kind of invertebrates ; but their learning capability is still much debated among biologists			0
the creatures have been known to break out of aquariums and into others in search of food , and they have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs stored inside			0
they are the only invertebrate which has been shown to use tools , with some species retrieving discarded coconut shells and reassembling them to use as shelter			0
in tests they can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns			0
it is thought the suckers that stud its arms temporarily shut down on sensing a chemical made by its skin			1
the @entity55 researchers said : ‘ we were entirely surprised by the brilliant and simple solution of the octopus to this potentially very complicated problem			2
’ the team from the university ’s @entity60 began by capitalising on the ability of the octopus ’s arm to stay alive long after amputation			2
despite being able to move , grab and suck , amputated arms failed to attach to other arms – as long as they had skin on them			1
if they had been skinned , they happily grabbed hold of them			0
a close - up image of an octopus ' suckers			0
they temporarily shut down if they sense a chemical on the octopus ' skin			2
during tests the researchers said amputated arms still moved and grabbed after they 'd been removed , but they failed to attach to other arms as long as they had skin on them and when presented with skin in a plastic dish , they stuck to the dish but not to the skin			1
further experiments pointed to a substance made by the skin stopping the suckers from sucking			0
finally , the researchers showed that living octopuses can override the anti-knotting mechanism			0
the journal @entity99 reports that this could be useful if the cannibalistic creatures spy a piece of octopus flesh they ’d like to eat			0

an octopus ’ brain does n’t know where each of its arms are at any one time
but , despite the potential confusion , the creature does n’t get tangled up
@entity13 scientists found this is because its suckers ca n't stick to themselves
they temporarily shut down if they sense chemicals on an octopus ' skin
researchers said amputated arms still grab after they ’ve been removed
but they fail to attach to other arms as long as they have skin on them
once the skin is removed , the arms grab , move and stick like normal
