by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 4 april 2013 arrogant investment bankers at @entity3 thought they were immune from the ‘ ordinary rules ’ of society , a withering independent report concluded yesterday			1
the scandal - hit lender has been accused of fostering a ‘ winning at all costs ’ culture and deserting its values in the relentless pursuit of growth			1
huge bonuses lavished on investment bankers helped some ‘ lose all sense of proportion and humility ’ , the report said			2
scandal - hit : @entity3 has been accused of fostering a ¿ winning at all costs ¿ culture and deserting its values in the relentless pursuit of growth the staggering largesse of @entity3 was also made clear			1
between 2002 and 2009 , 60 investment bankers shared average long - term performance - related bonuses totalling £ 170million every year – or just under £ 3million a year each over the period , according to the report			2
this came on top of their salaries , annual bonuses and other benefits			0
a tendency to push the rules to the limit was epitomised by its controversial tax avoidance unit – the @entity39 division – which generated an income of more than £ 1billion a year for the bank between 2007 and 2010 , the report said			2
this division is being shut down by new chief executive @entity42 as part of efforts to restore the lender ’s bruised reputation			0
the independent report , spearheaded by veteran lawyer @entity48 , was commissioned in the wake of @entity3 ’ £ 290million fine last summer for rigging crucial @entity51 interest rates			1
but it also looked at a long list of scandals that have dogged the lender , from mis - selling payment protection insurance to customers , to its £ 7.7million fine in 2011 for duping elderly savers into gambling their nest - eggs in risky stockmarket investments			0
mr @entity48 , the vice chairman of investment bank @entity61 , called for a raft of changes including stricter curbs on pay and better treatment of customers			0
@entity3 chairman sir @entity68 said the 236 - page document , which cost the bank almost £ 18million in fees , made ‘ for uncomfortable reading in parts ’			1
he added : ‘ that is bound to be the case when one asks for an independent examination of this kind , and we must learn from the findings			0
’ under scrutiny : the report focuses heavily on bumper awards paid out under former chief executive @entity83 , pictured the report focused heavily on the bumper awards dished out to @entity3 ’ investment bankers under disgraced former chief executive @entity83 , who was promoted to the top job at the start of 2011 after running the investment bank for years			1
mr @entity83 amassed more than £ 100million in pay and perks between 2005 and his resignation in july last year following the interest rate - rigging scandal			0
the report said the six and seven - figure packages regularly handed out at the investment bank , @entity100 , ‘ contributed significantly to a sense among a few that they were somehow unaffected by the ordinary rules ’			0
it added : ‘ a few investment bankers seemed to lose a sense of proportion and humility			0
’ mr @entity83 was feted at @entity3 for turning @entity100 into a global giant after joining in 1996			2
but the report said the lender ’s rapid expansion across a number of divisions in the years up to the financial crisis produced ‘ cultural challenges ’			0
it became increasingly dominated by the investment bank ’s winning ‘ at all costs ’ culture			1
the report said : ‘ winning at all costs comes at a price : collateral issues of rivalry , arrogance , selfishness and a lack of humility and generosity			1
’ it added : ‘ we believe a culture developed within @entity3 , quite possibly derived originally from the investment bank , which came across to some as being ‘ ‘ clever ’ ’ or what some people have termed ‘ ‘ too clever by half ’ ’ , even arrogant and aggressive			2
