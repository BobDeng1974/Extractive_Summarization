' this was a horrific and unusual attack of a defenceless school girl making her way home via her usual route , along one of @entity15 ’s busiest shortcuts , at the beginning of friday afternoon rush - hour			1
' she says the attack happened for some considerable time - possibly in the region of two to three hours			2
violence : this section of the park was closed off as police searched for clues following the attack shortly after 4.15pm on friday ' i am appealing to motorists , pedestrians and any one who may have been using the park between 16.45hrs - 20.00hrs , who may have seen a man following a girl in school uniform , to contact us			1
' an extensive search of the park is underway and local officers are conducting house - to - house enquiries , and we have already been receiving helpful information from members of the public			2

' all calls will be treated in the utmost confidence			0
' he said the girl was being supported by her family and they are hoping she will make a full recovery			0
local residents spoke of their disbelief that such an attack had happened within yards of commuters walking home			0
terrifying assault : the girl finally reached home at 8pm and was taken to hospital for surgery @entity120 , 28 , said : ‘ i imagine the poor girl ’s family must have thought it would be safe for her to walk home in the afternoon from the bus stop because lots of people are about at that time			2
