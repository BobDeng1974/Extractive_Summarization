by @entity0 there was a time at the @entity2 when managers had to get by with just 11 men			0
they would name their starting selection and the game would unfold , for better or worse , largely beyond their control			0
but the impact substitute carries an ever increasing importance , as shown by the record 29 goals scored so far in @entity11 by those who have been summoned from the bench			1
this tally is already six goals more than the second highest total , set in 2006 , and we still have the business end of the tournament to get through			2
impact : @entity21 emerged from the bench to score @entity24 's extra time winner against the @entity25 and seal a quarter - final place match winner : @entity28 , a half - time replacement for @entity30 , scored the goal that took @entity32 into the last eight at the expense of @entity35 goals scored by substitutes at @entity2 ( top five ) : 2014 - 292006 - 232002 - 211990 - 201982 - 16 source : @entity39 pretty much every team at the @entity2 has an ace up their sleeve , from @entity43 of @entity44 , who came on to grab the winner against @entity46 , to @entity47 , who netted with his first touch in @entity32 's draw with @entity50			1
@entity51 earned @entity52 a draw against the @entity25 in the 94th minute after emerging from the bench , while @entity28 made a crucial intervention in @entity32 's second round tie with @entity35 having missed out on the starting @entity57 on tuesday night , @entity21 came on at the start of extra time to conjure @entity24 's winner against the @entity25 and book a quarter - final place			0
flying : @entity51 , a substitute , heads the ball past @entity25 goalkeeper @entity63 to earn @entity52 a draw in the group stage encounter crucial intervention : @entity44 's @entity43 scored a late winner against @entity46 having come on with 15 minutes left @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity35 and @entity11 have also benefited from a substitute scorer			2
but the master of introducing the impact sub seems to be @entity83 's @entity82 , with @entity85 players scoring from the bench no less than four times at the tournament			2
on two occasions it was @entity91 , who came on to score the winner against @entity93 and the crucial second against @entity74			0
@entity95 leave it late again @entity97 : @entity83 coach @entity82 celebrates with @entity98 , who came off the bench to score their winner against @entity78 breakthrough : @entity103 celebrates after scoring for @entity83 against @entity74 after coming on @entity104 's @entity103 had earlier scored against @entity74 from the substitutes ' list and , most recently , @entity98 , a replacement for @entity108 , converted the winning penalty against @entity78 to take them through to the quarter - finals			1
the 29 goals scored by subs at this year 's tournament already far exceeds the previous best - 23 back in 2006 - illustrating the value of strength - in - depth at major tournaments			1
