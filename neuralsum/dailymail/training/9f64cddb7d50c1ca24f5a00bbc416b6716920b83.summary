by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 28 december 2013 seeing clear : @entity3 from @entity4 has been helped by the @entity6 jab the condition is painless and its onset insidious			2
indeed , many of the 500,000 @entity10 with age - related macular degeneration ( @entity12 ) might not have noticed it for some time – simply needing a brighter light to read by , colours seeming less vibrant and faces harder to recognise			1
but for one in ten the problem can worsen suddenly and , without swift intervention , permanent sight loss occurs			0
now sufferers have been thrown a lifeline			0
a new injectable drug has become available on the @entity22 which may help those who have n’t responded to the current treatment regime			1
it also promises to halve the number of jabs required			0
the macula is the centre part of the retina ( the photographic film at the back of the eye ) , which changes the light focused on to it into electrical messages to the brain to give us high - definition colour vision			1
there are two types of @entity12 : dry , which is where the cells of the macula die off very gradually , about which nothing can currently be done , and wet , which is where abnormal blood vessels leak fluid into the macula			1
if left unchecked , it is this leaking process that can lead to sudden blindness			1
the causes of @entity12 remain unknown			1
if people have dry macular degeneration , ten to 15 per cent will go on to have wet @entity12			1
other risk factors are smoking and having a family member who has had it			0
the new drug , @entity58 , which was approved for @entity22 use this year , is an @entity59 drug that works by blocking the production of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor ( @entity59 ) in the cells in the eye			1
@entity58 also contains a substance called @entity66 ( placental growth factor ) , which appears to further delay the leakage from abnormal blood vessels compared with the other drugs used for the condition – @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity3 ’s right eye has improved significantly since she began treatment with @entity58 last year			2
‘ i was diagnosed with wet @entity12 when i was 59 , which was a horrible shock , ’ says @entity3 , a retired teacher and bookkeeper from @entity4			1
‘ i ’ve worn glasses throughout my life and noticed that the vision in the right eye was getting blurry			2
i went to my gp , who referred me to an ophthalmologist			0
‘ when i was told i could lose my sight , i was devastated			0
at that stage i was told i needed immediate injections of @entity72 to prevent my vision deteriorating further			0
’ new drug : @entity58 , which was approved for @entity22 use this year , is an @entity59 drug that works by blocking the production of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor ( @entity59 ) in the cells in the eye any drug for wet @entity12 is administered by injection directly into the eyeball			1
the eye is first anaesthetised with drops , before a very fine needle injects the drug into the central part of the eye , which is filled with a viscous thick clear liquid , the vitreous humour			1
treatment is painless , and takes minutes			0
patients then administer antibiotic eye drops for a few more days after the injection to reduce the risk of infection			2
‘ it was daunting at first to have the @entity72 treatment but i soon got used to it , ’ explains @entity3 , 66			0
‘ the treatment helped so i continued with it for ten injections , which my medical insurance covered			0
my husband and i had to find the money for another three monthly shots privately [ £ 1,700 per injection ] before , fortunately , the @entity22 funding was approved for the rest of my care			1
’ @entity3 went on having the injections at roughly four to six - week intervals until may this year , when her consultant suggested @entity58			2
‘ i had my first injection of @entity58 in may , then two more at monthly intervals , ’ says @entity3			0
‘ as the back of my right eye remained dry , injection times have been extended from first six weeks , then eight weeks , then ten weeks			2
‘ i ’m due to have my next jab in february , when it will be 12 weeks between injections			0
although i do n’t mind injections , it is great that i do n’t have to go as often for treatment			0
’ @entity150 , consultant in ophthalmology at @entity152 , says : ‘ with @entity72 treatments , patients have to come in to clinic every four weeks			0
with @entity58 , if we only have to see patients and treat them every eight weeks , then that should reduce pressure on clinics significantly , and save on time costings as well as the price of the actual drugs used			2
so it should be beneficial in a wider capacity to the @entity22			1
’ @entity158 , consultant eye surgeon from the @entity159 and @entity160 , who is pioneering the training of nurse practitioners to deliver injections , says : ‘ treatment by both drugs results in stable vision in two - thirds of patients and improved vision in about one third			1
the cost of treating this condition with both drugs remains high but there may be fewer injections needed with @entity58			0
both drugs produce good outcomes for patients , so the future is looking brighter for @entity12 sufferers			1

nearly 500,000 @entity10 have age - related macular degeneration ( @entity12 )
new drug available on the @entity22 could save thousands from blindness
@entity188 is injected in the eye and reverts the process
