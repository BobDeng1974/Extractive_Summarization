by @entity0 @entity2 bravery : @entity3 used cunning , guile and desperate pragmatism to stay one step ahead of her @entity8 hunters , living in underground slums , on coal piles or the beds of not - so - kindly @entity12 with a conscience			1
© @entity14 for three years @entity3 lived a life of isolation and fear in the dark heart of @entity19			1
she was what the @entity20 called a u-boat , one of the scores of @entity25 who managed to survive out of sight beneath the surface of society			1
@entity3 remained hidden for three years in @entity30 and her battle to avoid capture and stay alive is told in a powerful new book , @entity34			1
she died 15 years ago but the book , just published in @entity36 , is based on tape recordings she made about her time in hiding			1
‘ she became a submarine and she stayed submerged and she lived , ’ said her son @entity38			1
from 80 cassette tapes , @entity38 and author @entity41 have produced what has been described as a masterpiece			0
the book says that by 1941 both @entity3 ’s parents were dead			1
she was 25 and working as a slave labourer at an arms factory in the capital			0
by this time the @entity50 ’ plans for @entity25 had moved from deportation to slavery and eventual extermination			0
as time dragged on and workmates disappeared , she realised that she could be next			0
so she failed to turn up for work one day and then went to the forced labour office pretending to be a neighbour who said @entity59 has been deported			2
despite her ruse , the @entity20 came looking for her and she had to go on the run			1
she said : ‘ i did not want to belong to the community of death			0
’ ' submerged ' : the title of the book ( left ) is a reference to the names the @entity50 gave @entity25 like her ; ' u-boats ' who stayed hidden beneath the surface of a society that wanted to put them on to trains to concentration camps , then to gas chambers ( right ) slaves : @entity25 slave labour girls line up for work			2
@entity3 was 25 in 1941 when she started working as a slave labourer on a lather at a @entity83 plant in the capital she dyed her hair , scavenged a set of false papers and became known to the handful of @entity89 who would give her shelter			2
one night here , one night there , sometimes sleeping in a coal pile , other times surrendering to the advances of not - so - kindly helpers			0
‘ not all motives were noble , ’ she said			0
‘ i had to be pragmatic			0
’ she was alive when the city fell to the @entity99 in may 1945			0
‘ the survival of every single submerged person was based on a chain of coincidences that was hard to believe and often wonderful , ’ she said			1
‘ i lived on a tightrope			2
’ @entity105 : had she been captured , she would most likely have ended up in a concentration camp like this at @entity108 , where she would probably have been sent to a gas chamber almost nowhere to hide : while in hiding in @entity30 , she had to keep a keen eye out for the ' catchers , ' often @entity25 themselves , who were deployed by the @entity50 to engage in conversation in parks , cafes and on the street with people they thought were other @entity25 on the run ( this picture was taken in 1938 )			0
