by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 01:56 est , 28 may 2013 @entity2 is about to start a high - tech - and high altitude - hunt for graffiti vandals using pilotless drones of the sort used by western forces to fight the @entity9 in @entity10			1
instead of a warhead the @entity12 drones will be equipped with cameras to catch out the vandals costing the national railway company over six million pound costs in the annual clean up of graffiti			1
most graffiti is sprayed at night so the plan calls for the drones to carry infra red cameras which will pick out the vandals at work			1
vandals : graffiti artists have been targeted @entity12 train terminals at night testing is due to take place at particularly badly hit depots and marshalling yards where trains are parked in a pristine condition at nightfall only to be covered in unwanted ' art ' come sunrise			1
strict anti-surveillance and privacy in laws may yet challenge @entity12 's programme			1
internet giant @entity42 was forced to give people an opt out from their @entity45 service when a huge outcry followed its inception			0
but @entity48 insists that only people found on its property would be targeted by the cameras			2
the idea behind the drones comes from years of frustrating cat - and - mouse games with vandals across railyards and depots			1
' we have to find news ways to wage the anti-graffiti struggle , ' said the head of railways security @entity63			0
a black box recorder on the drones would accurately pinpoint where the graffiti is taking place to be able to allow for successful prosecutions once vandals are identified			0
the high - tech ' tracker ' drones will be painted in the red and black of @entity2 railways			1
they can fly nearly 500 feet high at nearly 30 mph for 80 minutes at a stretch			0
drones : the unmanned aircraft are more usually used in warfare they cost Â£ 50,000 and will be controlled from a central command post			0
@entity12 's planned deployment comes just weeks after the @entity2 government halted an expensive project to build its own military drone called @entity88 because of mounting costs			2
@entity12 belives that its @entity91 squadron may also prove useful in identifying where bridges and long track stretches that need extra maintenance			2
drones are used by @entity97 forces in @entity10 to target @entity9 forces			0
the @entity99 is also carrying out a highly controversial a drone programme to target suspected terrorists in @entity102			0
many @entity102 see it as an infringement on their sovereignty and complain that innocent civilians have also been killed , something the @entity99 @entity108 officially opposes the use of @entity99 drones on its territory , but is believed to have tacitly approved some strikes in past .			0

train company @entity12 wants to catch vandals in the act
it *hopes* to equip them with infra - red cameras to *monitor* stations at night
