by @entity0 @entity1 is commonly used to smooth out wrinkles , but new research suggests it could be used to help asthma sufferers			1
in a world first , doctors in @entity6 injected botox directly into the vocal cords of asthma patients who were struggling to breathe			1
injecting @entity1 into the vocal cords of some asthma patients can help to relieve their symptoms these patients also suffered from a condition called vocal cord dysfunction which causes muscle spasms that make breathing difficult			1
the @entity1 partly paralysed the muscles , allowing them to relax and make breathing easier			1
this effect lasted for between two and three months			1
a group of 11 patients received up to 24 injections , with 60 per cent reporting significant reductions in symptoms			2
the injections partially paralyse the muscles causing them to relax - the effect lasts for up to three months ‘ local injection of botulinum toxin - botox - may be an effective treatment for intractable asthma associated with abnormal vocal cord movement , ’ said professor @entity29 from @entity31 ’s @entity30			1
‘ some of our patients had one or two injections , improved markedly and did n’t need any more treatment			2
‘ overall , the patients improved because they ’re not as breathless as they have been in the past			1
’ however , there were some side effects with patients experience a softening of their voices			2
the researchers say , though , that none struggled to swallow after the treatment			0
patient @entity51 , 68 , has suffered severe asthma for years			0
eventually , her voice box became affected and she felt like she was being strangled			0
she said : ‘ it was terrible			0
i could lie down , but as soon as i stood up , i ’d be gasping			0
‘ it felt like there was a ball in my throat like i was being strangled			0
‘ now i can get up off my seat and move around without struggling to breathe			0
’ she added : ‘ i did ask the doctor if he could inject it into other places to make me look better , but that did n’t happen ! ’ the medical trial took 18 months of research and a team of 11 researchers .			0
