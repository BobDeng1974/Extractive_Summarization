by @entity0 mothers exposed to low levels of lead are more likely to have obese children – and baby boys are the most affected , according to a new study			1
the effects of lead pollution on the brain and nervous system are already well known			0
and now researchers at the @entity12 have found the first link between the metal and weight gain in future generations			1
mothers exposed to low levels of lead are more likely to have obese children - and boys are the most affected there is no safe level of lead for human health , doctors warned last month			1
experts are now moving to lower the blood lead level thresholds previously considered safe , in response to international health authorities debating the health effects of low level lead exposure			1
a report by the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) in @entity33 recommended that blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per decilitre be the indicator used to determine unusual exposure to lead			0
in 2009 , the @entity32 suggested a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per decilitre or higher warranted investigation			2
the report said that as it was not possible to tell whether low level exposure had meaningful adverse health effects , there is no level that should be considered safe			2
in an experiment , female mice were exposed to low doses of lead and their offspring were examined and found to have put on weight			1
male mice saw an eight to 10 per cent increase in weight			1
‘ the data supports the obesogen hypothesis that toxicant exposures in the womb contribute to the higher rate of obesity , ’ said @entity52 , assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the university			2
‘ there are certain chemicals that are considered the hallmarks of the obesity epidemic and lead has not been one of them			2
’ research fellow @entity68 added : ‘ to see that the level i and others have considered very low has such statistical significance in this study is alarming			2
‘ there is no minimum safe level for lead			1
our research really supports this			0
’ lead was once common in paints and petrol until it was banned , but still exists in older homes and in air , water , soil , food and some consumer products			0
baby boomers and older adults were once exposed to lead at much higher levels of exposure than today , which are closer to the lower dosage examined in the study			1
previous research has shown that lead exposure decreases foetal and early childhood growth in human infants and causes obesity in later life			1
the new study , published in the journal @entity102 , looked at how what a mother ingests , even before pregnancy , impacts her offspring			0
experts believe at exposure to chemicals is most serious at conception			0
in the experiment , female mice were given drinking water that was contaminated with lead two weeks before mating , as well as throughout pregnancy and nursing			0

' @entity125 was once common in paints , toys ( pictured ) and petrol until it was banned , but still exists in older homes and in air , water , soil , food and some consumer products their litters were measured at three , six and nine months for energy expenditure , spontaneous activity , food intake and body weight			0
at nine months they were tested for glucose tolerance			0
the groups of mice were exposed to lead at 2.1 parts per million ( ppm ) , 16ppm or 32ppm , alongside another group that had no exposure to lead			1
the study found that from birth , male mice in the two highest exposure groups outweighed the controls going into adulthood and an increase in body fat at all dosages showed up in males at three months			1
both sexes exposed to the highest dose ate more than the control group , with males eating more at six months and female food consumption increasing at 9 months			0
exposed males showed impaired insulin levels at 9 months and both sexes showed the expected decline in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production as they aged			0
the female mice exposed to lead had higher energy expenditure at three months and the exposed males had lower energy expenditure at nine months .			2

@entity12 scientists link lead to obesity in future generations
male baby mice whose mothers were exposed to lead were 10 *%* *heavier*
supports theory that exposure to chemicals in the womb fuels weight gain
study shows there *'s* no minimum safe level for lead exposure
previous research shows lead stunts growth and causes obesity in later life
