the only thing cuter than a soaking wet puppy , is one caught in slow - motion			2
the frenetic scenario would be familiar to any dog owner at bath time - but for a new photo book the speedy motion has been slowed down using a high - speed camera , to capture every skin - flapping second			0
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 has photographed puppies from just four weeks to a year - old for a book called ' @entity15 '			1
it follows on from an earlier book on adult dogs called @entity15			0
eye really hate this : a puppy 's eyes roll back in its head as it swings its face side to side , in one of the images from @entity28 photographer @entity10 has already produced one book called , @entity15 , which involves slow - motion pictures of adult dogs getting the low dog : a puppy clings to the ground and shakes side to side , to try and dry off during the photo shoot one hundred cute canines shook their way through their individual hour - long photo shoots and predictably the young pups caused chaos on set			2
when they were n't attacking shoelaces , or reliving themselves on camera bags they were falling asleep under the warm lights			0
ms @entity10 visited pet owners and rescue shelters to find her furry subjects and in the process even took one in			2
@entity55 , an eight - year - old schnauzer , needed a new home when his previous owner developed dementia and ms @entity10 was happy to take him in : ' he 's a puppy to me , i 've only had him for a few months			1
' the wet puppy project was hardly work at all for ms @entity10 : ' i was drawn to the idea of surrounding myself with puppies			1
it was almost medicinal - spending the day overdosing on cuteness			0
' puppies galore : ms @entity10 said the hardest things about the project was resisting the temptation to adopt all the puppies from pet shelters do you mind ? a puppy looks bemused by the photo shoot and appears to be asking for some privacy while it dries off naughty : ms @entity10 said when the puppies were n't attacking shoelaces , or relieving themselves on camera bags they were falling asleep under the warm lights ; nevertheless , she said they were easier to photograph than adult dogs drip dry : a schnauzer tips its head to the side as water drips from its floppy ears on to the ground ; 100 dogs took part in the photo shoot get my best side : ms @entity10 visited pet owners and rescue shelters to find her furry subjects and in the process even took one in baby baths : the puppies involved in the project were aged from just four weeks to a year - old , so could n't be cuter despite the occasional bout of naughtiness , ms @entity10 said the puppies were ' easier ' to photograph than adult dogs , saying : ' i think they were just more sensitive to moisture and being tussled			1
' the main challenge , ms @entity10 explained , was resisting adopting all the puppies she came across when recruiting dogs at pet shelters			1
she said : ' i had to resist becoming a puppy hoarder myself , and it was difficult to watch owners struggle with their new puppies behaviors			1
watching two species struggle to communicate with each other is hard , and when one of them is a baby it is even harder			0

the hardest challenge , ms @entity10 said , was having to ' resist becoming a puppy hoarder myself '
