the finish might have been uncharacteristically scruffy , scored after his first shot came back off the keeper , but it was a landmark goal for @entity4 at the @entity5 on saturday as he made it 400 goals for @entity8 in a 2 - 0 win over @entity10			1
@entity4 scored with the last kick and @entity12 scored with practically his first , putting @entity8 1 - 0 up after just 56 seconds			1
between the two strikes @entity13 saved a @entity16 penalty as @entity10 dominated the first half but they could n't make their pressure tell			1
for @entity4 , still only 27 , it was another milestone			2
' i hope to score many more , ' he wrote on his @entity24 page			0
@entity4 ( left ) , @entity12 ( centre ) and @entity26 celebrate @entity12 's goal in the first minute for @entity8 against @entity10 @entity12 ( left ) lashed the ball in after neat play from @entity4 to continue his fine form for @entity8 @entity10 enjoyed a better first half , despite the scoreline and captain @entity16 missed a penalty in the ninth minute @entity13 celebrates his penalty save but @entity8 were fortunate to take a lead into half time @entity4 tapped in @entity8 's second goal in stoppage time to seal the victory over @entity10 the @entity40 has reached the 400 goal total in just 471 games with 309 goals in the league , 75 in the @entity45 and 32 in the @entity46			1
goals in the @entity48 and the @entity50 and @entity49 have also made up the stratospheric total			0
he also has 141 assists to his name in those 471 matches			0
afterwards @entity56 said : ‘ @entity4 gave us what he always gives us			2
but it ’s not just about him it ’s about the whole forward line and the whole team			0
’ @entity12 was once again decisive after his two goals in midweek against @entity63 in the @entity45 and he is now just six games from picking up a league winners medal in his first season			2
the early strike would have counted for nothing however if @entity10 had made their first - half domination pay and had @entity13 not stopped that eighth - minute penalty			1
as @entity4 raced from inside his own half to get the late late second , @entity56 could be seen jumping up and down in the technical area long before the ball was in the back of the net			2
he knows what a major hurdle his side have now cleared			0
the victory sees @entity56 's side move five points away from @entity83 , who take on @entity85 later on saturday @entity4 skips past two @entity10 challenges as @entity8 secured an important win against @entity89 's fourth placed side @entity4 attempts an acrobatic kick for @entity8 against @entity10 in the @entity89 encounter at the @entity5 on saturday @entity8 were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with @entity13 releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from @entity12 past @entity97 into far corner			1
between the two @entity8 moved the ball quickly with @entity100 releasing @entity4 and his pass poked home by the @entity103 who has now scored 12 goals in his last 12 games			1
far from being shell - shocked by the early set - back @entity10 unleashed the big guns and @entity8 were under - fire for the rest of the first half			1
@entity111 and @entity112 both went close and were running an out - of - sorts @entity113 ragged			0
on eight minutes @entity10 should have equalized			2
@entity112 went down easily under a half challenge from @entity113			0
it was a generous spot - kick and @entity13 got down well to @entity16 ’s kick to save it			1
with a full @entity5 sensing that a win here would be a huge step towards the title for @entity8 , and @entity10 in a scrap of their own to finish in the top four the game was being played at cup final pace			1
@entity16 flattened @entity100 who for once he did n't need to exaggerate the fall as he crashed to ground			2
and full - back @entity130 risked a first half sending off with foul after foul			0
he was shown a yellow and never appeared for the second period			0
adding to the drama was the panic in @entity8 ’s defence			2
@entity113 was either failing to stay on his feet or giving the ball to @entity10 forwards			2
the falling down was contagious with @entity143 – another who did n’t come out for the second half – also losing his footing despite the perfect playing conditions			0
@entity26 ( right ) attempts a diving header for @entity8 as his side looked to increase their lead at the top of @entity89 @entity8 have a five - point lead over @entity83 , who could cut the deficit to two points with victory over @entity85 @entity111 continued to threaten			1
it ’s not difficult to see why on - loan @entity158 forward @entity160 , who @entity10 are obliged to buy this summer , can not get a game at the moment			1
it is also why many @entity166 supporters think @entity167 should not be @entity169 ’s first choice			0
@entity111 led the line and with @entity171 and @entity112 buzzing around him			0
@entity10 gave @entity8 more problems than any visiting side at the @entity5 this season			1
@entity111 came the closest in what remained of the first half making room for a shot from the edge of the area and hitting the base of @entity13 ’s post but @entity8 remained a threat on the break			1
in their best move @entity4 and @entity12 linked with @entity26 who pulled the ball back to @entity186 instead of finishing			1
the midfielder set - up @entity4 and his shot flashed wide			0
games at the @entity5 can be like bull fights that used to be held in @entity191 before they were banned			0
everyone in the arena knows the bull loses , it ’s just a matter of when			0
but @entity10 had worn the horns in the first half and @entity8 were relieved to get down the tunnel at half time still in one piece and still 1 - 0 up			1
the second half brought more calm to a @entity8 defence that now had @entity202 back alongside @entity113 after his first half spent in midfield			0
@entity10 carried less threat and @entity8 went close with @entity26 heading wide and @entity4 hitting the bar with a free - kick			1
he won a the kick with a brilliant run away from @entity16 who up - ended him and his effort beat @entity97 but not the frame of the goal			2
with 25 minutes left he moved to centre - forward as @entity12 was taken off			0
there was no @entity216 as he made his way off to a thunderous reception from the home fans			0
he goes into tuesday ’s game against @entity63 looking for his 20th goal of what has been an excellent first season			0
@entity160 replaced @entity111 and immediately @entity10 had their best chance of the second half with @entity13 palming away @entity112 ’s shot			1
but there was to be no reward for all their fire and invention and when @entity4 raced clear to score the second with the last kick of the game it was all over in every sense .			2

@entity12 scored @entity8 's opening goal against @entity10 in the first minute of the game
@entity13 kept out a tame penalty from @entity10 captain @entity16 in the ninth
@entity4 sealed the three points with one of the final kicks of the game
