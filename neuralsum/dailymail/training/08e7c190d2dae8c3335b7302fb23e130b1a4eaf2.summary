the government 's eavesdropping agency @entity3 is to give a parliamentary committee full details of its links to a controversial @entity8 internet monitoring programme , it has been revealed			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) will receive a report on claims that it received material through the secret @entity15 scheme ' very shortly ' , according to chairman sir @entity16			2
he said : ' the isc is aware of the allegations surrounding data obtained by @entity3 via the @entity8 @entity15 programme			1
' the @entity9 will be receiving a full report from @entity3 very shortly and will decide what further action needs to be taken as soon as it receives that information			2
' mps from the @entity9 will also seek reassurances from @entity27 that @entity8 spies are not snooping on the emails of @entity31 webs users on a trip to the @entity8 next week			1
sinister powers : @entity31 's @entity3 , based in @entity34 , @entity35 , is largely responsible for monitoring the phone calls and emails of terror suspects the @entity9 is going on a week long tour of the @entity8 and will meet senior figures from @entity8 intelligence agencies			1
the development comes after it was claimed yesterday that @entity31 spies had access to the @entity15 system			0
secret documents published yesterday suggest the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) has direct access to data held by internet giants including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
the documents – which appear to be slides from a 41 - page training presentation for intelligence agents – suggest the agency can access email , photographs , social network information , chat records and other ‘ stored data ’ held by the companies , as part of its ‘ @entity15 ’ project			1
they also suggest the @entity31 government ’s listening centre , @entity3 , has had access to the system since at least june 2010			2
the project generated nearly 200 intelligence reports in the 12 months to may 2012 , a 137 per cent increase on the previous year			0
it is unclear whether other agencies , such as @entity80 and @entity81 , were also involved , meaning the true extent of the snooping could be higher			0
a @entity3 spokesman said ‘ we do not comment on intelligence matters ’ , but added : ‘ our work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework			2
’ privacy campaigners warned that the revelations suggested the creation of a ‘ @entity93 by the back door ’			0
they come after a proposed plan to pay internet companies to collate user data from @entity31 computers was dropped only last month in the face of opposition from @entity102 backbenchers and @entity103			0
pressure : the disclosure will pile pressure on @entity107 to explain how much he knew about the intrusion as he prepares to attend the secretive @entity110 conference today , a closed - door meeting that conspiracy theorists already believe is where leaders plot world domination i know what you 're doing this summer : the @entity120 administration defended the order on thursday , calling it ' a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats ' ' reprehensible ' : director of national intelligence @entity125 branded the program ' reprehensible ' and said it risks @entity8 ' security last night @entity130 called on @entity107 to come clean to mps on the extent of @entity31 ’s role			1
shadow home secretary @entity134 said : ' it is important for the @entity31 intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad including from the @entity8 , particularly in the vital counter-terror work they do			1
' however , there also have to be legal safeguards in place , including proper protection for @entity31 citizens ' privacy , proper oversight and checks and balances to make sure intelligence powers are not misused			0
' and the public need confidence that their privacy is being properly respected and protected			0
' that is why the prime minister , home secretary and foreign secretary , and all the intelligence agencies should provide full information to the @entity9 as swiftly as possible , and the @entity9 should have full support to pursue this and report			2
' the @entity161 said it obtained the slides from a whistleblowing intelligence officer worried about invasions of privacy			1
according to the newspaper , the @entity15 programme appeared to allow @entity3 to circumvent the formal legal process required to obtain personal material , such as emails , photographs and videos , from internet companies based outside the @entity31			1
reports by the paper and the @entity176 suggested the @entity177 and the @entity47 can tap directly into the central servers of nine leading internet companies			0
but a number of them , including @entity52 , @entity57 , @entity53 and @entity54 denied the government had ‘ direct access ’ to their servers			1
@entity51 said it does not voluntarily participate in any government data collection and only complies ‘ with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers ’			1
yet one slide appears to be a timeline of when the companies began to participate in @entity15 , starting with @entity51 in september 2007 and ending with @entity57 in october 2012			1
according to the reports , @entity15 was established under president @entity195 in 2007 and has grown ‘ exponentially ’ under president @entity120			2
bombshell : @entity47 and @entity177 have been extracting audio , video , photos , e-mails , documents and other data from @entity57 , @entity54 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity203 and @entity204 key source : @entity15 has been described by @entity47 officials ' as the most prolific contributor to the president 's @entity208 , ' providing analysts with a wealth of ' raw material ' classified : the particulars of the @entity15 data - mining program have been outlined in a top - secret @entity216 presentation for senior intelligence analysts , which ended up being leaked participants : this graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined @entity15 , with @entity57 being the latest addition in october 2012 spying : the @entity47 has been getting millions of phone records from @entity224 on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order , that was only revealed today plundered : the @entity47 and @entity177 have been pulling personal data directly from the mainframes of top @entity8 tech giants , including @entity55 , @entity52 , @entity57 , @entity54 , @entity51 and @entity224 for the past six years the director of @entity233 said that the law ensures that only ‘ non-us persons outside the @entity8 are targeted ’ , raising the likelihood that @entity31 are among those captured in its net			1
@entity240 , of @entity241 , said : ‘ we already have laws which allow law enforcement officials to request information about @entity31 citizens using @entity8 services			0
‘ if these laws are being circumvented by using these @entity47 spying arrangements then that would be a very serious issue			0
’ @entity251 , director of civil rights group @entity252 , said : ' these reports suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale with the @entity257 , @entity258 and our own @entity31 intelligence community showing contempt for privacy , legality and democracy itself			0
' do n't we still believe that spies should be accountable to the public they serve and protect ? ' this is the kind of arrogance behind the attempted " snoopers ' charter "			0
have those who failed to persuade in the @entity273 chamber decided to smuggle blanket surveillance in through the back door ? ' revelations about the snooping programme follow separate reports about the @entity47 being allowed to collect all telephone user data from @entity224 , one of the largest telephone firms in the @entity8 , for three months			1
set up by @entity282 in 1953 , the @entity47 is the eyes and ears of @entity8 across the globe , intercepting 1.7 billion emails , phone calls a day ’			1
it is the the secretive body that serves the military and intelligence communities by collecting all forms of foreign communications to prevent attacks on the @entity8			2
it was prohibited by law from intercepting domestic communications without a warrant until @entity195 issued a caveat in the wake of 9/11 under the controversial ' terrorist surveillance program '			0
nonetheless , over the years the @entity47 has been engulfed in a number of snooping scandals			0
they include president @entity304 's illegal wiretapping , through the @entity47 , of five members of his national security staff , two newsmen , and a staffer at the @entity309 in a bid to uncover who was leaking information about his plans for the @entity314			2
in 2005 it was revealed @entity195 had authorized the @entity47 to eavesdrop on @entity8 calling abroad without warrants in a bid to thwart terrorism			2
he strenuously denied the allegations until he finally conceded he had committed an impeachable offense			0
and in 2009 , under president @entity120 , the @entity8 @entity321 acknowledged the @entity47 had gone beyond its remit in tapping the phonelines of @entity8 citizens , including a congressman , but claimed that the acts were unintentional and had since been rectified			1
last month , it was accused of building an £ 800million cyber base to keep tabs on @entity8 citizens			0
the state - of - the - art data centre in the @entity333 desert – codenamed @entity334 – is intended to bolster online security efforts			0
but former employees say it could be used to monitor people ’s private emails			0
the @entity47 branded the allegations ' unfounded ' , adding that it remained ' unwavering ' in its respect for @entity8 laws and @entity8 citizens ' civil liberties , and noted that it was subject to broad oversight by all three branches of government .			1
