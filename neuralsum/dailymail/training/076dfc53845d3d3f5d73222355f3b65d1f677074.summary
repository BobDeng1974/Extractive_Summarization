by @entity0 published : 23:25 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 06:14 est , 18 september 2012 the debilitating condition me is not caused by viruses , according to a study which claims to dismiss this theory ‘ once and for all ’			1
hopes for a treatment were raised three years ago when researchers sensationally claimed that most cases of the illness - also known as chronic fatigue syndrome - may be triggered by little - known bugs in the blood			1
now experts say the latest study - which involved many of the same @entity17 researchers - provides conclusive evidence that this theory was wrong			1
tiredness : @entity20 , or myalgic encephalomyelitis , affects 250,000 people in @entity23 and symptoms include extreme fatigue and muscle pain the research , at @entity28 in @entity29 , found no evidence that sufferers are infected with the rare viruses xmrv or @entity33 , which are distantly related to @entity34			1
it is believed that the 2009 study suggesting the link , which was published in a prestigious scientific journal , may have been flawed			1
similar studies at @entity40 and in the @entity41 have also failed to find evidence of the viruses in the blood of sufferers			1
co-author of the latest study @entity47 , a professor of epidemiology , said : ‘ we went ahead and set up a study to test this thing once and for all and determine whether we could find footprints of these viruses			1
‘ we found no evidence of infection with @entity56 and @entity33			2
these results refute any correlation between these agents and disease			0

some sufferers become so weak they are bedridden or confined to a wheelchair			0
in profile : some sufferers of @entity20 , or myalgic encephalomyelitis , become so weak they are bedridden or confined to a wheelchair it was dismissed as ‘ yuppie flu ’ in the @entity72 and the lack of a clear cause led to scepticism over whether it was a genuine illness			2
it was only properly recognised in 2002 when then chief medical officer sir @entity77 said me was a ‘ debilitating and distressing condition ’			0
in 2009 ‘ spectacular ’ findings published in the journal @entity81 pinned 70 per cent of cases on the rare viruses , usually found in mice			0
' we went ahead and set up a study to test this thing once and for all and determine whether we could find footprints of these viruses			2
we found no evidence of infection with @entity56 and @entity33			0
these results refute any correlation between these agents and disease ' @entity47 , epidemiology professor it is now thought these results may have been contaminated and the journal has retracted the research from the @entity100 in @entity101			2
this time researchers took ‘ extraordinary care ’ to eliminate contamination in the chemicals used in the study , which tested the blood of 147 me patients and a similar sized group of healthy volunteers			1
speaking of the findings , published in @entity112 , the journal of the @entity114 , professor @entity47 said : ‘ we ’ve tested the xmrv / @entity33 hypothesis and found it wanting			0
‘ but we are not abandoning the patients			0
we ’re not abandoning the science			0
’ experts believe there may be a genetic cause for me , or it may be triggered by a traumatic event or a weakness in the immune system .			2

researchers thought bugs in blood may trigger illness
but experts say latest study proves this was wrong
