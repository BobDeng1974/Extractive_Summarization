plagued by a feeling something was n't right , student @entity0 sought medical help			1
she was struggling to understand things she had read , and felt lost in conversations			0
but the @entity6 phd student could never have comprehended the source of the problem - an ' evil twin sister growing ' in her brain			1
surgeons operating to extract what they believed to be a tumour in her brain , were shocked to discover the growth was in fact an embryonic twin , complete with bone , hair and teeth			1
@entity0 , 26 , a student at @entity6 , was diagnosed with a pineal tumour in her brain after noticing she was struggling to comprehend things she had read , and felt lost in conversations known by its medical name , a brain teratoma , the growth is very rare			1
indeed , dr @entity27 , the expert at the @entity28 in @entity29 who operated on @entity31 , has removed around 7,000 brain tumours and has seen just two teratomas			1
in the past , teratomas have been reported to contain hair , teeth , bone and rarely more complex organs including eyes , hands , feet and limbs			1
and in some cases they have been found to resemble a foetus			0
miss @entity0 first noticed something was n't right last september , when she struggled to register things in her mind , @entity45 reported			1
' if a couple of people were talking in a room , i would n't understand what was happening , ' she said			0
frustrated at doctors ' apparent inability to find an answer , the 26 - year - old launched her own search for answers online			2
it led her to the @entity28 and dr @entity27 , who has developed a minimally - invasive way of reaching deep into a person 's brain to extract tumours			1
the procedure , he said , is a type of keyhole surgery rather than traditional brain surgery , which involves opening the skull and using metal retractors to allow him to insert a microscope deep into the brain			0
instead , dr @entity27 makes a half - inch incision in the brain to use fibre - optic technology and digital imagery to gently chisel away at the tumour			1
shocked when she woke to learn of dr @entity27 's discovery , miss @entity82 branded the tumour her ' evil twin sister who 's been torturing me for the past 26 years '			1
dr @entity27 said he feared the tumour could be cancerous			0
but surgeons operating on the 26 - year - old discovered the growth , indicated just above the red dot above , was in fact a teratoma - a growth containing bone , hair and teeth what are @entity99 ? a teratoma is a tumour with tissue or organ components from more than one different part of the body			1
they have been reported to contain hair , teeth , bone and rarely more complex organs including eyes , hands , feet and limbs			1
in some cases a teratoma has been found to resemble a foetus			2
they are usually benign masses , though some cancerous forms of teratoma are known to exist			0
mature teratomas , which are typically benign , are more commonly found in women			2
immature teratoma , which are typically cancerous , are more often found in men			2
they are thought to be present at birth , but are often not discovered until later in life			0
@entity99 can occur in the testes in men and ovaries in women , as well as the brain , skull , nose , tongue , under the tongue and in the neck			1
what are @entity138 ? pineal tumours are those that affect the pineal gland in the brain			2
the gland produces the hormone melatonin , which helps control sleeping			0
there are different types of pineal tumour , their name depending on the kind of cells from which they develop			2
the majority are germ cell tumours			0
different tumours cause different symptoms			0
they are generally caused by a build - up of fluid in the brain , which leads to increased pressure , or caused the tumour itself			1
they include : but tests revealed the mass was benign , and miss @entity0 is expected to make a full recovery in just three weeks			2
she said she wanted to raise awareness of dr @entity27 's technique			0
' this has to be mainstream , ' she added			0
' when they know you have a pineal tumour , they should tell you " you know what ? there 's a minimally invasive approach in which they wo n't kill you , they wo n't leave you with a disability			0
' prior to dr @entity27 's keyhole approach , he said the only option was to remove half of the patient 's skull to reach the tumour			0
he added : ' we want to be in and out without the brain knowing we were there , and i think that 's the beauty of this technique			0

@entity0 , 26 , was diagnosed with a pineal brain tumour
surgeons operating to extract the growth made a *startling* discovery
they found a teratoma - an embryonic twin with bone , hair and teeth
teratomas are often found in ovaries , testes but more rarely in the brain
