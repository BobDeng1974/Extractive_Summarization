@entity0 has urged @entity2 ’s fans to be patient and accept that manager @entity3 will not switch to a more direct brand of football			1
during the last home game against @entity10 @entity9 , the @entity7 crowd was noticeably tense and anxious as @entity2 ’s players moved the ball around and there was a point when one backpass to @entity0 was greeted with noisy discord			1
@entity2 won plaudits last season for the style of football they played under @entity3 as they accrued a club - record points tally ( 73 ) in the @entity22 and returned to @entity23 for the first team in five years			1
@entity0 has urged @entity2 ’s fans to be patient and stick with the players during this difficult period he also told fans to accept that manager @entity3 will not switch to a more direct brand of football things have not been so straightforward this time around , as @entity2 ’s form has been erratic and the tension among supporters is as much to do with the club ’s position in the table as it is with the slow tempo of their play			1
@entity0 , though , has explained that @entity3 will not be abandoning his principles just to get a few results on the board and he accepts that could mean the atmosphere at @entity7 being prickly , starting this afternoon against @entity46			1
‘ winning cures everything , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if you could pick the ball up and throw it in with your hands , then people would cheer for that			2
when wins are n’t coming as regularly as you would hope , there is an edginess			0
‘ it does n’t matter whether you are kicking the ball up in the air or passing it on the floor			2
' the fans want wins but , trust me , we want them even more			2
but we are a passing team and we are not going to get away from it			1
@entity3 does n’t bat an eye at it			1
@entity3 and his @entity2 side lost 3 - 0 to @entity71 in their last @entity22 outing but @entity3 has said that the team 's style of play is not to blame , and that his players need to perform better ‘ he encourages us to pass the ball and it is proven we can win games that way			1
he has been in charge for 18 months and it has been very positive			0
there will be no change			2
i love these fans and they are passionate			2
but i fight with my brother , too			0
do you know what i mean ? ‘ you do n’t always have to agree			0
i have always had a good rapport and banter with them			0
’ this is @entity0 ’s ninth season on @entity95 but there is no sense that he is approaching the end of the line in terms of contributing ; he has been one of @entity2 ’s more key performers this year and his durability and consistency means he has long since paid back the £ 3.5million it cost to sign him			1
@entity71 forward @entity105 puts the ball past @entity107 for his side 's second of the game @entity111 celebrates after scoring for @entity71 in their 3 - 0 defeat of @entity2 he arrived at @entity2 , initially on loan , from @entity114 under a cloud as his form had tailed towards the end of his spell at @entity119			1
returning to @entity120 , however , was never on the agenda for a man who will make his 371st appearance for @entity2 on @entity124			1
‘ too many @entity120 players do that , ’ said the 35 - year - old			0
‘ when the going gets tough , the manager changes , they get taken out of the team and they hit a low			2
the first instinct is to go back to @entity120			0
that is why most @entity120 players fail			0
i was always going to make it here			0
‘ i knew i had to get my career back on track , so there was a lot of stuff there in that first year for me to deal with			0
but my self - belief never wavered			0
it was just a question of taking my chance and putting things right			0
