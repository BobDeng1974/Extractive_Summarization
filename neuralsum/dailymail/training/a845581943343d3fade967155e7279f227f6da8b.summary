by @entity0 a look to dye for : @entity2 turns heads as she takes her friend 's dog @entity4 for a walk after the treatment @entity9 had his rose period – and now so too does @entity2 ’s four - legged friend @entity4 , after the @entity12 actress headed out with a friend 's dog , who was dyed a shocking shade of bubblegum pink			1
thanks to a fashionable £ 90 treatment , the one - year - old bichon frise now has a look that might go down well with pink - loving @entity24 professor @entity23 – even if it has raised eyebrows among some animal - lovers			1
ms @entity2 was spotted with the pink pooch on the streets of @entity29 , @entity30 , on friday , after @entity4 had the dye treatment at @entity32			1
owner @entity33 said : ‘ @entity34 is our biggest colour , but i do look after another bichon called @entity38 who comes in for a blue mohican			1
’ he said the beetroot - based semi-permanent dye is harmless			1
‘ all the dyes i use are completely animal - friendly			0
they are made from vegetable dye			1
' i wet the dog , rub it on like a shampoo , leave it for five minutes and then wash it off			0
because @entity4 is white , it takes really well			2
' she is a very calm dog , absolutely lovely , and she enjoys her groom			0
’ but tv vet @entity53 said : ‘ dogs are not playthings ; they are not dolls			1
if you are putting a chemical on a dog ’s fur , you could cause that dog problems			1
‘ even if the dye is completely safe – and the dye that @entity2 has used should be absolutely fine – you are still altering the way the dog looks and smells to other animals			2
potentially , it could have an effect on the way that dog interacts with other dogs			0
‘ a dog is still a living object that has n’t had any say on whether it wants to be pink			2
’ unsurprisingly , mr @entity33 – whose own dyed dogs have featured in campaigns for fashion house @entity79 – disagrees			0
‘ lots of people say it ’s cruel to dye a dog but i say , it takes no time , it does n’t affect their skin and they do n’t look in the mirror and go , “ oh , i ’m so embarrassed			2
” before and after : how @entity4 looked prior to the treatment ( left ) and while walking in @entity29 , @entity30 , on friday ( right ) ‘ rather , they get so much attention in public and all the strokes and interaction , it ca n’t be a bad thing			2
’ he also believes his salon will see a sharp increase in ‘ doggy dyes ’ during the @entity102			0
‘ oh yes , ’ he said			0
‘ i expect to get a lot of requests for red , white and blue			0
and i may be able to do the @entity102 circles on poodles			0
’ ms @entity2 , 22 , later took to her @entity110 page to reassure fans that the reason for the canine 's bright colour was because her friend was raising money for @entity117			1
no shaggy dog story : the @entity12 actress later took to @entity110 to reassure fans that the dog 's colour was a charity fundraising bid however , the actress is not the only celebrity to have been spotted with a coloured dog			1
@entity127 , the actress romantically linked to @entity128 , has dip - dyed her @entity130 terrier cerise , while @entity131 often has her bulldog ’s toenails painted a shocking pink .			0
