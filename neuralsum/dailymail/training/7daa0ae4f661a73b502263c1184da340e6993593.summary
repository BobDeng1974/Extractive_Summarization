by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 6 march 2013 @entity3 cardinals have been banned from talking about the @entity5 's internal deliberations ahead of the conclave to elect the next pope			1
@entity8 attending closed - door discussions imposed a media blackout wednesday , forcing the cancellation of the popular daily press briefings by @entity3 cardinals			1
the official reason for the blackout was that some details of the secret discussions about the problems in the church appeared in the @entity20 newspaper @entity19			2
media blackout : @entity3 cardinals have been banned from talking about the @entity5 's internal deliberations ahead of the conclave to elect the next pope but speculation mounted that the underlying aim of the blackout was to silence the @entity3 , who have been vocal in their calls for disclosure about allegations of corruption and dysfunction in the @entity32 's governance before they enter the conclave to elect a successor to @entity34			1
as a result , the conflict appears to be a microcosm of the likely battle lines heading into the election : @entity3 and @entity41 cardinals have indicated they want a pope who will impose some order on the @entity32 's inner workings , while the @entity32 - based cardinals are defending their record and seeking to end the discussion			1
one @entity20 cardinal said the @entity49 , or the @entity32 bureaucracy , had been sorely maligned and that he could ' only say good things about it			2
' ' in the @entity49 , the pope has a docile tool that does exactly what he wants and tries to help him in the best of ways , ' @entity20 media quoted cardinal @entity59 , the retired administrator of the @entity60 as saying during a book launch tuesday			0
' of course it can always be improved			0
' that picture is at odds with evidence of turf battles , machiavellian machinations and allegations of corruption and cronyism that were exposed last year when private papal documents were leaked to an @entity20 journalist			2
the documents paint a portrait of an utterly dysfunctional , ungovernable @entity20 bureaucracy			0
silenced : cardinal @entity75 of the @entity3 attends a prayer at @entity77 in the @entity32			1
the blackout has forced @entity3 cardinals to cancel their popular daily press briefings the @entity32 denied it had exerted any pressure on the @entity3 cardinals to keep quiet and cancel their briefings			1
but the @entity32 spokesman , the rev. @entity85 , made clear that the @entity32 considered this week 's pre-conclave meetings to be secret and part of a solemn process to choose a pope , suggesting that he did n't necessarily appreciate the @entity3 ' candor			1
' @entity91 ( of @entity8 ) as a whole has decided to maintain a line of an increasing degree of reserve , ' he said			2
the debate played out as the @entity32 awaited the arrival of the last voting - age cardinal : @entity102 cardinal @entity100 @entity99 , who was expected in @entity103 on thursday			2
with his arrival , the @entity104 was expected to be able to set a date for the start of the conclave , where 115 men will select the next pontiff			0
the spokeswoman for the @entity3 cardinals , sister @entity111 , said wednesday 's briefing and all cardinal interviews were canceled after other cardinals expressed concern about the content of articles in @entity20 daily @entity19 , which over the past several days reported details of comments individual cardinals made in the closed - door meetings			1
denial : the @entity32 denied it had exerted any pressure on the @entity3 cardinals to keep quiet and cancel their briefings @entity19 reported wednesday , for example , that the head of the @entity32 's legal office had told the cardinals of the need for improved coordination among the various @entity32 offices and better communication between the @entity32 and local dioceses			1
none of those details came from the @entity3 briefing , where the @entity3 cardinals took pains to stress the secrecy of the actual proceedings			1
' i do n't think anyone was angry at the @entity3			2
they were angry at @entity19 , ' @entity111 told @entity1			0
' in true old - style catholic school teacher fashion , someone talks and everybody stays after school , ' @entity111 said			0
she added that the @entity3 had been assured that the @entity32 was pleased with their briefings			1
but @entity85 's palpable irritation suggested otherwise			0
@entity20 media reported that @entity32 - based cardinals wanted the election to take place quickly and speculated that @entity20 cardinals in particular were displeased with the @entity3 for making clear they were requesting more information about the @entity32 's internal governance problems			1
the implication was the @entity103 - based cardinals did n't want the @entity32 's dirty laundry aired out			2
conflict : @entity3 and @entity41 cardinals have said they want a pope who will impose order on the @entity32 's inner workings , while the @entity32 - based cardinals are defending their record @entity8 @entity164 of @entity165 and @entity166 of @entity167 said in tuesday 's briefing that they favored taking a longer time for pre-conclave discussions to gather more information			1
' we need to give it the time that 's necessary , ' @entity166 told the packed press conference at the @entity176 , the @entity3 seminary up the hill from the @entity32			1
' i believe the feeling of the cardinals is that we want to have enough time in the general congregations so that when we go to the conclave itself it 's a time of decision			2
' drawing laughs , @entity166 added : ' and it is hard to get a bad meal in @entity103			0
' @entity41 cardinal @entity189 also called for more time			0
' among the cardinals , we barely know one another , ' he told @entity194 newspaper			0
' there 's no hurry			0
' @entity20 newspapers and international media , including the @entity1 , have reported on the @entity3 ' unique briefings and how they contrasted with the near - silence from other cardinals and @entity85 's comparatively sedate @entity32 briefings			1
during tuesday 's briefing , @entity164 and @entity166 held a lively and informative 30 - minute chat with some 100 reporters and two dozen television crews from around the globe			0
they revealed no details of their closed - door discussions			0
but they nevertheless provided journalists with insight about the process from two people actually involved			0
' we 're trying to help people have a greater understanding of what the process is and the procedures and background information , ' @entity166 told reporters			0
' right now that 's about all we can share with you but we 're happy to try to do it			0

@entity8 imposed media blackout wednesday , forcing cancellation of @entity3 cardinals ' popular daily press briefings
