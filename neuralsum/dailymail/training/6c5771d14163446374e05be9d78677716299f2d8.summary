patients are facing a bleak end to the year as @entity3 units , gp surgeries and the ambulance service struggle to cope with unprecedented demand			1
a string of reports yesterday painted a picture of a system creaking at the seams due to the rising population			1
at one overcrowded inner city surgery , gps are being forced to offer patients quickfire two - minute consultations just to ensure that they can be seen before @entity17			2
and only yesterday the @entity31 revealed patients were resorting to queuing up outside another gp practice in @entity34 at dawn just to get an appointment			2
last night , as @entity38 said the @entity26 was in danger of being ‘ overwhelmed ’ , it also emerged that : elderly patients – so - called bed blockers – are being kept in hospital for up to a year after being declared fit for discharge ; sir @entity25 has written to hospital managers demanding a ‘ zero tolerance ’ of long trolley waits ; @entity49 mayor @entity48 has urged the public to take a taxi to @entity3 rather than dialling 999 to help ease the pressure on the ambulance service			1
@entity3 units are facing unprecedented strain and last week recorded their worst waiting times on record			1
on monday , sir @entity25 wrote to hospital managers warning of a ‘ worrying increase ’ in patients spending more than four hours on trolleys in casualty			1
ambulance bosses have been forced to recruit paramedics from @entity65 amid an estimated nationwide shortage of 3,000			2
@entity67 , which covers @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , said it was advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians and 70 emergency care assistants			0
details of the desperate shortage of 999 workers emerged as a leaked memo this week revealed plans to allow ambulance response times for some serious calls to double from eight to 19 minutes amid a severe strain on the nationwide service			1
@entity67 confirmed it had been hiring overseas because its recruitment plans had been ‘ challenged ’ by the nationwide shortage of paramedics			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have been carrying out some international recruitment in @entity65 for paramedics where their qualifications , skills and experience are very similar to our own and meet our own high standards for staff			0
’ the @entity96 said it was also looking at other countries			0
the news came after the @entity99 announced it had flown to the other side of the world to hire 175 @entity103 paramedics to start in january because of the small number of local applicants			0
the letter , passed to the @entity31 , told them to carry out a full investigation every time a patient ended up for waiting more than 12 hours			0
dated 22 december and sent to medical directors at hospital trusts , it reads : ‘ there should be a zero tolerance of over 12 - hour waits for admission and such a wait should be classified as a serious incidence , and we would expect a root - cause analysis			1
’ the pressures are partly due to an ongoing crisis caused by bed - blocking , in which hospitals have to look after elderly patients even when they are well enough to be discharged due to a lack of care at home			1
the shortage of beds on wards prevents sick patients being moved out of @entity3 so they remain languishing on trolleys			1
figures uncovered by @entity38 from @entity136 requests show that in 2013/14 , a total of 26 bed - blocking patients were kept in hospital for least three months			1
this included one at @entity142 who was there for 365 days because of ‘ patient or family choice ’			0
the trust would not provide further details			0
but in some cases , relatives have demanded hospitals look after elderly patients while they go on holiday or simply because they do n’t like a care home ’s curtains			1
@entity3 units are facing unprecedented strain and last week recorded their worst waiting times on record ( file picture ) at @entity160 a patient was kept in for 329 days , also due to their own choice or that of their family , while at @entity167 someone waited eight months because there was no space in a care home			1
bed blockers cost the @entity26 an average of £ 264 for each day they are kept in hospital			1
last month , more than 29,000 patients languished on trolleys for at least four hours – including 26 for more than 12 hours			0
@entity176 , chief executive of the @entity177 , which represents @entity3 doctors , said : ‘ it ’s very challenging at the moment			1
last week was one of the worst weeks for a long , long time			0
‘ we ’re expecting it to be very busy over @entity17			0
it does n’t show any sign of a let - up			0
if a hospital is bunged up with people who ca n’t be discharged , patients will have to wait on trolleys or in ambulances outside			2
’ dr @entity194 , chair of the @entity196 ’s council , said : ‘ gp services are under unsustainable pressure , hospitals are full and investment in adult social care has been slashed			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity199 said : ‘ this christmas there are record numbers of elderly people trapped in hospital who would rather be at home with their families			2
‘ it is a sad reflection on a system that is creaking at the seams and in danger of being overwhelmed			1
’ @entity211 , charity director at @entity212 , said : ‘ these figures are yet another serious warning sign of growing pressure on gp practices and district nurses and a social care system on the verge of collapse because funding has utterly failed to keep pace with demand			2
’ yesterday mr @entity48 issued an urgent appeal to the public not to dial 999 over the festive period unless it was a genuine emergency			1
he urged patients to take a taxi to @entity3 if they suffer minor fractures after slipping on ice or when partying			1
the ambulance service is under considerable pressure			0
earlier this week it emerged that the @entity235 was considering relaxing waiting time targets for serious incidents			0
last night it also emerged that ambulance and @entity26 staff are planning a two - day strike over @entity242			2
the @entity244 union said paramedics would still respond to 999 calls			0
similar protests were held over the @entity248			0
meanwhile one unnamed gp surgery was yesterday offering patients two - minute appointments to ensure they were seen before @entity17			0
a photo was taken of the appointments chart by a whistleblowing doctor and circulated on @entity254			0
a @entity256 spokesman said : ‘ these figures give a misleading impression - while long waits to be discharged are unacceptable , there are actually fewer as a proportion of hospital admissions over the last few years			1
we know the @entity26 is busier than ever which is why we ’ve given it an extra £ 700million for thousands more doctors , nurses and beds this winter			2
‘ the @entity26 has ensured there are plans in every area to manage extra demand			2
