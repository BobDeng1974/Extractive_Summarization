a burlesque performer is attempting to eradicate all negativity surrounding the word ' fat ' – by embracing it as an honest , body - positive description of her own physique			1
during a recent @entity10 talk , @entity7 , from @entity8 , revealed that she also calls herself ' short ' , because she is 5 ' 3 '' , and ' wife ' , because she is married , noting that each of these words is just an honest description of what she is			1
and ' fat ' is just another self - descriptor for her , who insists that the word does n't have to be used as a synonym for ' ugly '			0
' we as women are programmed to tell each other that we 're not fat , because to many people - both men and women - fat is the worst thing that you can be , ' she said during her talk , which took place earlier this month			2
and those negative perceptions of bigger people start young : the top ' magic wish ' for girls 11 to 17 , according to a study , is to be thinner			0
@entity7 explained that , according to other studies , ' the more we 're exposed to body diversity , the more we tolerate , accept , and yes , even prefer , different body types '			1
that promising fact is something that encourages the dancer to perform burlesque , which enables her to expose her audiences to a ' fat ' body in a positive , glamorous way			2
changing minds : studies show that the more people are exposed to different body types , the more they like them ; @entity7 hopes exposing her audience to a fuller figure will change their perceptions @entity7 also quoted another performer named @entity73 , who has spoken out in the past about the fact that the body diversity of burlesque performers ' challenges us to rethink the narrow confines that society has given us for what 's desirable '			1
it certainly challenged @entity7 , who weighs in at 240lbs			0
she admits she was in awe at the first burlesque show she ever saw , immediately resolving to try it herself			0
she began performing in 2012 , and says the experience has been both empowering and incredibly body - positive			1
while the first time she performed she was nervous about people seeing her arms jiggle , once she did it , she felt like she could ' walk through fire '			0
now , whenever she 's feeling insecure , she can think back to that first performance ; @entity7 recommends other people find a similar ' courage reference ' - a moment you felt brave that you can think back to at times when you feel more insecure and afraid			2
self - esteem boost : @entity7 said she was nervous before her first performance because of how her arms looked , but now she feels great about her body @entity103 crowd - pleaser : while a few people have left nasty comments on the @entity107 page for her ted talk , @entity7 said the response has been mostly positive though @entity7 gave her @entity10 talk in 2014 , it was only posted on @entity107 three weeks ago			1
since then , the clip has generated nearly 38,000 views - and plenty of positive feedback			0
' i ’ve never been so happy in all my life , ' she wrote for @entity118			0
' i ’ve had this stupid grin on my face for a week straight			0
' besides a few ' trolls ' posting vicious negative comments , @entity7 received a slew of positive messages , including letters of thanks , personal stories , and an email from a teenage girl who watched the video with her younger sister and said it made them reevaluate the way they viewed their bodies			2
' i really think we - and by " we " i mean nice people and body - positivity - are winning , ' she said .			1

at 240lbs , @entity7 says she 's not being negative when she calls herself ' fat ' - she is just being factual
she says she likes performing burlesque because it helps open people up to liking different body types
the dancer says she 's *thrilled* at the positive reception her @entity10 talk has received , adding that she believes it means ' body - positivity ' is working
