mrs @entity1 , who has shrunk from a size 38 to 22 since her operation in 2012 , said : ' i ca n’t afford to pay for a weight loss camp , but i do n’t see why the government ca n’t step in and provide for her with a funded camp on the @entity3			1
' it would be an investment for her future - i have tried everything i can to help her at home , with no luck			0
' mrs @entity1 had her gastric band operation done for nothing by a private surgeon after she appeared in the press two years ago calling to have the operation on the @entity3			1
at the time , she said : ' i ca n’t afford a personal trainer or weight - loss surgery – i need help from the taxpayer			2
' now she believes the only way her daughter will lose weight is by attending a weight - loss camp for children - paid for by the @entity20			1
' i do n't want @entity4 to end up the way i was and if she does n't stop , that 's exactly what 's going to happen , ' she said			1
' i just ca n't get through to her - she will eat anything she can get her hands on			1
' i make hearty home cooked meals at home from scratch , and i serve up smaller portions , but @entity4 will always have seconds or finish up any leftovers - even though she does n’t need it			2
' mrs @entity1 said : ' i would love her to go to a kids ’ boot camp but it is just so expensive and way out of my price range			1
the camps i 've looked at cost about £ 4,500 and that ’s just not the kind of money i have			0
' i think she would really benefit from going to a boot camp , so she can be out of the home environment and completely educated by health professionals			2
' if she keeps on she will end up with no choice but to get a gastric band like me , and i do n’t want that for her			2
' i think my mum has done really well and i ’m proud of her			0
i do want to lose some weight so she can be proud of me too , but i do n’t find it easy			0
