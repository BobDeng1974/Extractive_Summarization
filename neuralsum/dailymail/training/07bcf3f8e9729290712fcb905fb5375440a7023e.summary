most people know lengthy , pretentious restaurant menus will hit you in the pocket - and now a major study has set the price at 11p per letter			1
linguistics professor @entity7 came up with his claim after spending months analysing 6,500 menus , from @entity11 - starred enclaves to cheap roadside diners			1
he said restaurants with longer , more complicated words in their descriptions would cost punters more , while cheap eateries tended to choose generic words such as ' tasty ' and ' hearty '			1
@entity25 's ( left ) @entity27 restaurant has lengthy words , as does the flasghip @entity31 diner by @entity32 ( right ) his research is published in a book called @entity35 : a @entity36 and includes his observations on a wide range of culinary language			1
only cheap diners feel the need to tell their customers the food is ' real ' , he writes , while expensive ones are more likely to tell their customers where it comes from			2
it was not so much the length of the menu description that was important , but the words within it			2
cheap restaurants had rambling descriptions but which used easy - to - understand words , while expensive ones tended to be more to - the - point but with more obscure and lengthy culinary terms			1
by analysing 650,000 dishes in the 6,500 menus he found online , prof @entity7 , of @entity63 's @entity62 , calculated a menu with longer words would cost 18 cents ( 11p ) more for every extra letter within them on average			1
costly : a study claims longer words in restaurant menus add 11p per letter to the price			1
pictured is @entity25 's restaurant @entity76 aux @entity75 , where dishes like assiette ( plate ) of piglet cost £ 54 wordy : customers at @entity83 in @entity31 , where three courses cost £ 95 , can expect ' @entity86 halibut with @entity88 king crab , cauliflower couscous , finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth ' he told @entity94 high - paying customers liked to be reminded that they were highly educated with lengthy or obscure menu descriptions			1
' you 're flattering your customers , but it 's also a bit of showing off , ' he told the newspaper			2
' cheap places ca n't do it because the diners want to know what they 're getting			2
' @entity25 's @entity76 aux @entity75 in @entity27 , touted as @entity105 's priciest restaurant , certainly lives up to the theory - up to a point			1
exception : @entity110 's elaborate dishes have names such as ' meat fruit ' and ' snail porridge ' its menu has words which would make many diners furrow their brows , including agnolotti ( filled pasta similar to ravioli ) of goat ’s cheese for £ 42 , assiette ( plate ) of piglet for £ 54 and @entity129 ( @entity128 ) chocolate and raspberry chocolate for £ 28			1
those without such deep pockets can head to the @entity134 branch of @entity135 , for the more humble ' juicy ' bangers and mash ( £ 4.99 ) or ' @entity139 , flame - grilled chicken breast , served with a fluffy jacket potato and buttered peas ' ( £ 5.99 )			2
compare that to @entity83 in @entity31 , @entity143 , where three courses cost £ 95 - plus a 12.5 per cent service charge			2
meals there include ' @entity86 halibut with @entity88 king crab , cauliflower couscous , finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth ' , ' fillet of sea bass with shellfish and sea vegetable minestrone , @entity156 , fennel and lovage ' , and ' ravioli of lobster , langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oscietra caviar and sorrel velouté '			0
@entity168 's restaurant @entity166 in @entity169 , west @entity143 , also uses exotic words - though its mostly resists telling its diners where there food has come from			1
@entity176 names there stick resolutely to describing the ingredients , which are expensive enough by themselves			0
the names range wildly from ' ballotine of guineafowl , @entity182 and tarragon jus ' ( £ 18.50 ) to ' fillet of sea bass , spiced peppers , aubergine caviar , basil oil ' ( £ 19.50 )			0
there are some notable exceptions to prof @entity7 's rules , however			1
@entity110 's @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity194 - where the tasting menu costs £ 220 per person - has famously pithy names for its dishes including simply ' snail porridge '			1
and at the tv chef 's dinner by @entity110 in @entity202 , west @entity143 , names include ' meat fruit ' , ' rice & flesh ' and ' savoury porridge '			0
that could explain why they 're all around the ' cheap ' price tag of £ 17 - by a celebrity chef 's standards , at least			2

study carried out by prof @entity7 of @entity63 's @entity62
he analysed 6,500 restaurant menus for length and the type of words used
dishes described with longer words cost more - ' at a rate of 11p per letter '
costly menus show off about food 's origin while cheap ones call it ' tasty '
