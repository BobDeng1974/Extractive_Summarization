by @entity0 published : 01:54 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 04:07 est , 20 january 2014 ultra-long lorries weighing up to 60 tonnes could be allowed into @entity3 despite fears they will pose a danger to cyclists , pedestrians and other drivers			1
plans to widen the use of 83ft ' @entity11 ' , already used in @entity12 and @entity13 and the length of two double - decker buses , are being considered today by @entity17 officials			1
but campaigners claim there is a gulf between conservative meps , who support their boost to business , and those in @entity25 who fear they will cause more road deaths			1
monsters : 83ft ' @entity11 ' like this one could soon be allowed on @entity3 's roads under plans to widen their use @entity31 , of the @entity32 , told the @entity33 : ' conservative meps plan to support the increased use of massive trucks across the @entity17			1
' this is despite the @entity25 government opposing their use on @entity3 roads because they cause more fatal accidents , more congestion and more pollution			2
' we risk letting mega trucks on to our roads via the back door			2
' the vehicles , known officially as @entity48 and @entity49 or @entity50 , can be as much as 22ft longer than the largest hgvs currently allowed in @entity3			0
they transport billions of tonnes each year in @entity13 , where they carry 90 per cent of all road freight			1
the huge trucks also carry almost three - quarters of the road freight in @entity12			1
trucks : more than a billion tonnes of freight a year are moved around @entity3 using traditional @entity58 , pictured yet they have been slow to spread to other @entity17 countries because of concerns about their safety			1
they are being trialled in @entity64 , the @entity65 and most recently in @entity66 , where they are only allowed to use motorways and major national roads			0
the trucks were barred from crossing international borders until a ban was partially lifted by the @entity73 in march 2012			0
the report , to be considered today by the transport committee of the @entity76 , said : ' there is widespread agreement that @entity50 would reduce operating costs for road freight and greenhouse gas emissions per tonne - km of goods transported as less vehicles would be used to transport the same amount of goods			0
' however , pollution could actually increase if the ultra-long trucks shift more freight away from the railways , the report admitted			0
danger : shorter hgvs have been involved in several collisions with cyclists in the past , including this one in @entity95 , north @entity96 , in october			0
there are concerns larger lorries could pose a bigger risk ' @entity101 could help with the @entity103 € ™ s objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 , but that there is a significant variation in the predicted impact , and that if modal shift towards road freight is significant , greenhouse gas emissions could in fact increase , ' it said			2
conservative mep @entity113 told the @entity33 @entity3 hauliers should be allowed to compete on a ' level playing field '			0
she added the government could refuse entry to @entity11 if it decided they were ' not appropriate for our roads ' .			0

@entity123 lorries weighing up to 60 tonnes are twice the length of a bus
they are already used in @entity12 and @entity13 where they boost business
@entity132 @entity131 said to support them but campaigners have raised safety fears
