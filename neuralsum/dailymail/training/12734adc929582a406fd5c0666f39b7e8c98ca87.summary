‘ he was spending money like crazy , ’ one of his worried creditors told @entity44			0
@entity1 , who said he had a banking background , struck him as very ‘ gentlemanly , cordial and very willing to listen and learn ’			2

@entity1 publicly broke his long silence for the first and last time on april 2 when he vehemently denied any wrongdoing			1
he said he originally left @entity9 on a ‘ short - term temporary basis ’ to raise additional capital ‘ for the business through the sale of my equity as we had run out of liquidity ’			0

but , according to @entity1 ’s sales pitch , it was traditional banks that people could no longer trust following the precedent of @entity9 ’s painful ‘ bail - in ’ last year			2
