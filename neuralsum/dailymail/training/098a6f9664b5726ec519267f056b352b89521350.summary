@entity0 will find it difficult to emulate the achievements of the ' @entity4 ' side of a decade ago and win the @entity6 title , according to former @entity8 star @entity7			1
the @entity9 was part of the @entity0 side which went unbeaten throughout the 2003 - 04 campaign en route to winning the league			1
the current @entity8 side lay sixth in the table on sunday morning after their 2 - 2 draw against @entity18 the previous day , 11 points off the pace set by @entity21 , who remain on course to go unbeaten all season too , albeit with 30 games still to go			1
@entity26 celebrates putting @entity18 ahead at the @entity27 to continue @entity0 's poor form @entity29 and @entity30 were unhappy with @entity32 's decision to allow @entity18 's first goal when asked if @entity0 could win the @entity6 title this season , @entity7 told @entity35 : ' it 's very difficult			1
' the current squad lacks the physical power the @entity4 team had in players like @entity41 , ( @entity43 ) @entity42 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
' but in football , everything is possible			0
they have ( the points gap ) with @entity21 , but we can still win the league			2
' pires , who left @entity0 in 2006 , is currently playing with @entity52 in the @entity53 - his first game with the club ended in a 2 - 1 defeat			1
however , it is a world apart from the pressures @entity60 is under at the moment , as @entity0 gave away a first - half lead to @entity18 and then had to rely on a @entity64 stoppage - time equaliser			1
@entity0 managed to earn themselves a point with @entity64 's stoppage - time equaliser @entity60 was frustrated throughout the game , but @entity7 says @entity0 fans should stick with him this season promises to be an even tougher test to 2013 - 14 , when @entity60 overcame severe criticism over his big - money signings and tactics to win the @entity74 and end a nine - year trophy drought			1
@entity60 recently celebrated 18 years with @entity0 , a testament to the club 's support , and @entity7 wants the fans to continue doing so as well , saying : ' i understand that the fans want to win the trophy			1
' but do not forget that @entity60 built the @entity0 team			1
' of course , it is important to win the title			0
but i always believe in @entity60 and in the team			2
@entity7 was part of @entity0 's ' @entity4 ' team along with the club 's record goal - scorer @entity45 @entity7 says his side had more ' physical power ' than @entity0 's current squad , who are 11 points off the pace ' he spent a lot of money on the team because he always wanted a good team			1
but i think the fans should trust him and believe in him			0
' the faith for @entity60 comes on both a footballing and a personal level for @entity7 , even if he does not consider himself worthy of following in @entity60 's managerial footsteps just yet			1
' @entity60 is a very important person in my life , ' @entity105 winner @entity7 added			2
' when the offer from @entity53 came forward i consulted with him , i explained to him the concept			2
he very positively said , ' @entity7 , go			2
if you are confident to play do n't wait			0
you need to go '			0
the @entity0 boss is still ' a very important person in my life ' says @entity7 , who is playing for @entity52 in the @entity53 @entity111 was a bright spark for @entity0 in front of their fans , but even he showed his frustration ' the job of a manager is very difficult			1
it 's a tough job			0
at this point of time i do n't think i 'm ready to take up that role , maybe later sometime i might			0
' football is my passion and i can still play , so i decided to come back to playing football			0
' if you have the passion , you need to play			0
whether it 's @entity0 or @entity52 , i am always up for a challenge			2
' meanwhile , @entity129 echoed his former team - mates sentiment regarding @entity0 's prospects this season , claiming @entity0 are now competing for third or fourth place			2
' i think @entity0 are fighting for third or fourth place , ' @entity129 told @entity134			2
' you look at @entity136 and @entity21 and they 're in a different league compared to @entity0			1
' they 're so far above @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity0 and @entity140			0
i think all these teams are fighting for two places , they 're fighting for third and fourth			0
' @entity21 grind out results			0
they 're so clinical in the way they get results and @entity136 stand a great chance , particularly if ( @entity148 ) @entity147 can keep playing like that			0
he was fantastic ( against @entity140 ) , absolutely different class			0
' those two teams are far apart from @entity0 , @entity139 , @entity138 and @entity140 , so that 's what @entity0 are left fighting for			0

@entity7 says current squad ' lacks the physical power ' his side had
@entity9 *midfielder* calls on @entity0 fans to back @entity60
@entity7 not ready for management yet as he continues *career* in @entity53
@entity129 said @entity21 and @entity136 are in a ' different league '
