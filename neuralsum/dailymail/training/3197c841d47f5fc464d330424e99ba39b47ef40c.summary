by @entity0 in the 1930s , countries around the world began to introduce white canes , which both helped blind people ‘ feel ’ the ground in front of them and made them more visible			0
the invaluable tool has barely been innovated since , but now several companies have developed technologies that help the cane ‘ sense ’ objects nearby			0
so - called smart canes use sonar to let blind people know , through vibrations , if there are objects ahead - and which way to go to avoid them			2
the device , which attaches to the top of standard white canes , uses sonar technology and vibrations to tell a user how far away an object is and can detect obstacles above knee level , preventing accidents the @entity22 is designed to help users detect obstacles above knee - level and prevent accidents from occurring			1
using sensors , the device detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft ( three metres )			2
it attaches to the top of a standard folding white cane , currently used by millions of visually impaired people across the globe			1
the @entity22 mimics the capabilities of bats , using sonar to detect objects in the surrounding environment			2
ultrasound waves are sent out and , when they return to the cane , they vibrate on the relevant side of to warn of an obstacle ahead			2
different patterns and intensities let the user know how far away an object is			0
the latest smart cane to hit the market is the aptly named @entity65 , from the @entity67 ’s @entity66 ( @entity68 )			1
according to the @entity70 , 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide			1
almost 90 per cent of these live in developing countries , with @entity74 home to the most , at 12 million			0
with that in mind , the @entity22 is designed to help users detect obstacles above knee - level and prevent accidents from occurring			1
using sensors , the device detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft ( three metres )			2
these sensors can detect a small 1 - inch ( 3cm ) wide and are adjustable , meaning people of different heights and with different cane holding styles can still use the device			2

different patterns and intensities let the user know how far away an object is			0
the device was perfected after extensive field trials with over 150 people and is now on sale for the equivalent of £ 30 ( $ 50 )			1
another , similar device is called the @entity122			1
it uses similar technology to help blind people navigate			0
it comes equipped with a dual - range , narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a hazard protection area in front of the user ( pictured ) @entity22 claim the device is especially useful for blind people avoiding obstacles ( demonstration pictured ) when they do n't have assistance , including low - hanging tree branches			1
each side of the device vibrates with different intensity if an obstacle is ahead to let the user know which way to move to avoid a collision an ultrasound sensor kit could enable people with visual impairments to ride a bicycle independently			1
the @entity149 unit has sensors to give the rider constant directional feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side , via vibrating buttons beneath each thumb			0
the device , which is detachable and can be fitted onto the handlebars of any bike , was designed by electronics engineer and entrepreneur @entity161			0
‘ blindness is not just a medical condition but possesses the larger dimensions of social exclusion , stigma and neglect , ’ said dr @entity162 , who has played a key role in the development of the @entity22			0
‘ blind people are often taken by surprise by over-hanging branches , protruding air - conditioners and parked vehicles while navigating through unfamiliar terrain			0
‘ @entity65 warns the user of such objects in their path through a unique system of vibratory patterns , designed to detect potential obstacles even at head height			2
’ and dr @entity184 , business development manager for @entity186 at the @entity187 said : ' the @entity22 is a mobility aid device that will have a positive impact on the day - to - day activities of the visually impaired in @entity74 and possibly further afield			1
' the cross-disciplinary team approach behind the @entity22 has enabled the successful delivery of this technology to the marketplace			0
' another device known as the @entity122 ( pictured ) is on sale in the @entity198			0
it comes equipped with a dual - range , narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a ' hazard protection area ' in front of the user using similar ultrasound technology to the @entity22 despite its innovation , the @entity22 is not the first such product to hit the market			1
another known as the @entity122 was launched in various countries including the @entity198 back in 2011 , using a similar technology			0
it comes equipped with a dual - range , narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a hazard protection area in front of the user			0
two ultrasound sensors provide range data on the closest potential hazards such as plants , people , road signs and over-hanging branches			1
and two small , button - shaped tactile vibrators on the handle give the user information about upcoming obstacles in much the same way as the @entity22			2
both devices are seen as being invaluable tools for the visually impaired , and could help to drastically reduce the number of accidents that occur when using white canes .			1

@entity74 company @entity68 have *unveiled* their £ 30 ( $ 50 ) smart white cane
called @entity22 , it helps the visually impaired avoid potential hazards
device uses ultrasound to detect obstacles up to 10ft ( 3 metres ) away
it will then vibrate to tell the user which way to move to avoid a collision
another product called the @entity122 has been on the market since 2011
