@entity0 has lifted the lid on the row between @entity3 and coach @entity4 at @entity5			1
in a turbulent week in @entity6 , @entity3 seemed to agitate for a move away from the @entity9 side , with the fuss he caused eventually resulting in president @entity11 calling the club elections a year early			2
following that controversy , @entity5 have been on a strong run of form , beating champions @entity16 three times			2
@entity3 ( left ) in action for @entity5 in their @entity20 clash against @entity16 on wednesday @entity3 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) clashed after the former threw a tantrum in a pre-season training session , according to @entity5 defender @entity0 the 31 - year - old , in action for @entity5 against @entity26 , says the argument was resolved immediately after after wednesday night 's 3 - 2 @entity20 quarter - final victory over @entity31 's side , @entity0 spoke to @entity33 radio station @entity32 and explained how the row started			1
he said : ' it happened when we returned from holidays			0
suddenly , because of a foul that did n't get called [ in training ] , @entity38 threw a tantrum			2
there was some friction , some things were said			0
' afterwards , the coach spoke to him in the dressing room and that was that			0
it happens at every club , but because this is @entity5 it 's big news			0
and that 's the problem			0
' while @entity0 claims the issue ends there , the @entity9 press reported several other points of tension between @entity3 and the coach			1
speculation fuelled that @entity3 could be on the move after he then followed @entity65 's @entity64 account @entity5 - based @entity66 reported that @entity3 was angered by @entity4 on the day the @entity68 coach arrived at the club , declaring that he was the team leader			1
he was also upset by the club firing kitman @entity70 , a great ally of the players , while two other companions , @entity74 and @entity75 had already left in the summer			0
after the row , which @entity0 claims was sparked by that incident in training , @entity3 was dropped by @entity4 for the clash against @entity82 's @entity81 , which @entity5 lost 1 - 0			1
@entity3 skipped the club 's open training session the day afterwards and all hell broke loose , with the @entity5 no 10 following @entity65 on @entity64 to add to the confusion .			1
