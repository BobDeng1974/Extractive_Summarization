@entity3 women should be allowed to wear a full - face veil while appearing in court , @entity1 's most senior judge has suggested			1
@entity6 , the president of the @entity7 , said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should ' show , and be seen to show ' respect towards different customs			1
he said judges should be ' sensitive ' to the fact that they usually came from ' more privileged sector of society ' than many of those facing them and they should have an understanding of the ' different cultural and social habits '			2
@entity6 said @entity1 's privileged judges must be aware of their ' subconscious bias ' when dealing with poorer members of society his address to the @entity26 came at a time of uncertainty over the place of @entity3 traditional dress in the legal system			1
following a controversial trial in 2003 of a @entity3 woman accused of witness intimidation , lord chief justice lord @entity32 said there was a need for clear guidance on the issue			0
@entity40 refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying			2
the 22 - year - old was later sentenced to six months in prison at @entity47 after changing her plea			0
@entity40 refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying			2
here she pictured during her court hearing last year , the @entity51 upheld a ban by @entity53 on wearing the @entity3 full - face veil , the niqab			1
a case was brought by a 24 - year - old @entity53 woman , who argued that the ban on wearing the veil in public violated her freedom of religion and expression			2
in @entity6 's address , he said judges and lawyers often failed to recognise how ' artificial and intimidating ' courts could be for ordinary people			2
he said : ' i sometimes wonder whether our trial procedures really are the best way of getting at the truth			0
' would you feel that you had given of your best if you had been forced to give evidence in unfamiliar surroundings , with lots of strangers watching , in an intimidating court , with lawyers in funny clothes asking questions , often aggressively and trying to catch you out , and with no ability to tell the story as you remember it ? ' @entity86 was later sentenced to six months in prison at @entity47 ( pictured ) he said this did not mean a call for a major overhaul of court proceedings but said judges , lawyers and court staff must do as much as possible to help people feel at ease in court			0
he continued : ' judges have to show , and have to be seen to show , respect to everybody equally , and that requires an understanding of different cultural and social habits			0
' it is necessary to have some understanding as to how people from different cultural , social , religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave			0
' well known examples include how some religions consider it inappropriate to take the oath , how some people consider it rude to look other people in the eye , how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered , and how some people deem it inappropriate to confront others or to be confronted – for instance with an outright denial			0
lord @entity6 also suggested @entity3 women should be allowed to wear a full face veil while appearing in court ' more broadly , judges should be courteous and , generally , good - humoured ; and , while they should be firm , they should never , however great the temptation , lose their temper			1
' the judge made the comments a week ago during an address to the @entity26 , in which he spoke of modern aspects of the @entity1 legal system			0
in a lengthy speech entitled ' fairness in the courts : the best we can do ' , @entity6 also said judges and lawyers should always keep in mind how ' intimidating ' the court process can be for those involved in trials , including ' the parties , their families , the victims , the witnesses and the jurors '			2
speaking in the context of legal aid cuts , he said the importance of ensuring all parties involved in a case understand the goings - on in a court is now greater because ' people are having to choose between representing themselves or not getting justice at all '			0
he also said : ' judges may not appear to be neutral because they will almost always be seen , normally rightly , to come from a more privileged sector of society , in both economic and educational terms , compared with many of the parties , witnesses , jurors in court			1
' a white male public school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from @entity173 accused of assaulting or robbing a white female public school woman will , i hope , always be unbiased			1
' however , he should always think to himself what his subconscious may be thinking or how it may be causing him to act			0
' @entity177 , executive director of the @entity178 , told the @entity179 : ' @entity6 understandably recommends judges understand the expectations of how those ' from different cultural , social , religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave ' and that the judiciary should show ' respect to everybody equally '			1
' it was a missed opportunity , however , not to acknowledge that occasionally – for example on a defendant wearing a full face veil – doing so might conflict with justice being seen to be done , or even justice being done			1
' my concern is not theoretical ; it is now 18 months since a judge at @entity197 wasted a great deal of court time dealing with the question of full - face veils , and made a heartfelt plea for central guidance to avoid this inefficient use of expensive court 's resources being replicated elsewhere			1
' the lord chief justice 's office has been dealing with this for a long time but seems disappointingly reluctant to issue any direction			0

@entity6 said @entity3 women should be allowed to wear a full - face veil when appearing in court to show respect to ' different customs
he also said judges must be aware of their ' subconscious bias '
judges are ' rightly ' seen as from ' privileged ' part of society , he said
he cited a judge ruling on a case of an unemployed traveller as an example
