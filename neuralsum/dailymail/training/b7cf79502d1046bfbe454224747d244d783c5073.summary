with progression to the next round almost out of @entity3 ’s reach and holiday prices discounted as the @entity15 led to limited demand , @entity3 supporters are expected to cut their losses and rush to book the remaining deals before prices return to their normal value			1
the @entity15 has had an impact on the @entity23 travel industry this year as patriotic holidaymakers chose to put - off their holiday plans in fear they ’d miss out on the celebrations if @entity3 were to progress to the later stages of the tournament			2
grief : booking a holiday may be the perfect tonic for @entity3 supporters this summer typically one of the busiest periods , bookings in june have been lower than normal causing the industry to offer deals to fill flights and accommodation during the peak holiday season			2

' a slow booking period followed by a sudden surge in activity is a trend we see time and time again			0
however , when there is more supply than demand , prices drop			0
' @entity3 fans deserve to be cheered up this summer , that ’s why we ’re encouraging them to seize the opportunity and book their getaway while there are still deals to be had			0
' @entity81 football fans can still score a good holiday deal , even if their national team ca n’t score on the pitch			0
