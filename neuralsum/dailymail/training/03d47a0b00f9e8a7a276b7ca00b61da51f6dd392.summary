by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor labour leader @entity2 today promised to end the ' terrible scandal ' of low pay by linking the minimum wage to average earnings			1
but the move threatened to backfire after the @entity8 highlighted official figures which suggested the minimum wage would be 20p lower today if the policy had been introduced in 2010 when they took over			2
business minister @entity12 claimed the minimum wage had ' never been higher ' as a proportion of wages , suggesting that @entity16 's proposal would hit low earners in the pocket			1
labour leader @entity2 unveiled his minimum wage proposal in a speech at the @entity21 in @entity22 today @entity16 rejected the claim - as seperate analysis said the national minimum wage could be worth more than 60p an hour for 5.2 million people if it was set at 60 per cent of average take home pay			1
mr @entity2 told @entity28 's today programme that @entity30 had ' much , much further to go ' to end poverty pay			0
he said increasing the minimum wage as part of a ' national mission ' for the @entity16			2
the @entity16 leader said : ' what we ’re proposing is the government will set , the next @entity16 government will set a target for the minimum wage for the five years of the next parliament , set as a proportion of average earnings			1
' we want to raise it as a proportion of average earnings compared to where it is now because i believe the minimum wage is too low , i do n’t believe we ’re doing enough to tackle low pay			1
' but official figures over the four years since 2010 show that average earnings rose 6.2 per cent according to the @entity54			2
at the same time , the national minimum wage will have gone up by 9.6 per cent , the low pay commission says			1
if the @entity58 had linked the minimum wage to average earnings it would have gone up from £ 5.93 to £ 6.30 - and not the £ 6.50 it is today			1
@entity2 unveiled his minimum wage policy to @entity16 supporters today			2
in a radio interview this morning he claimed raising low pay would be the next @entity58 's ' mission ' mr @entity2 this morning insisted he was not going to set out the exact level he wanted to minimum wage to be - but the @entity8 insisted his plan to link it to average earnings could hit ordinary workers ' pay packets			1
he said : ' i do n’t want to be overly coy , but i do n’t want to name a figure today because we precisely want to get this right			0
' what we need is something which is a much clearer aim for a parliament and it will be the @entity81 ’s job to meet that target and i think that ’s the right thing to do for our country			0
' we can carry on as we are , or we can say this is n’t good enough and we ’ve got to change and we ’ve got to build a higher wage , higher skill economy with higher productivity and the minimum wage is an essential part of that			2
' under the @entity94 's plans a five - year target would be set in 2015 by the new government , with the independent @entity81 left to decide how best to implement it			0
the minimum wage is currently £ 6.31 for adults , but less for younger people and apprentices , and is due to rise to £ 6.50 this year			1
one suggestion is that @entity16 would raise the minimum hourly rate to 60 per cent of median earnings , which would see it rise to around £ 7.14			1
explaining the minimum wage mr @entity2 said : ' i want people to be in no doubt - we are determined , as part of a national mission for the next @entity16 government , to tackle the problem of low pay and substantially raise the minimum wage			1
' he said his proposal ' gets at what i think is aterrible scandal in this country , which is that we have still five million people in low - paid work , unable to make ends meet '			0
the @entity16 leader added : ' the minimum wage has done a good job in tackling the worst of exploitation , but we ’ve got to go further now in tackling the problem of low pay			1
' but the plans were attacked by business groups			0
the @entity132 's @entity131 said : ‘ the national minimum wage has been a success in raising wages for the lowest paid because it 's been left to the @entity81 , not politicians , to set the rate			2
' a government proposed target would undermine the @entity81 ’s independence			0
' the manufacturer 's organisation the @entity141 said : ‘ the proposals to overhaul the remit of the @entity81 , including … setting a statutory minimum wage target linked to average earnings is an unnecessary distraction			1
its primary objective is to provide an evidence - based judgement on what the @entity151 rates should be			0
' the @entity153 said : ‘ there is a clear risk that ahead of next year 's general election , politicking around the minimum wage … could lead to unaffordable promises that cost jobs and growth			2
' the @entity81 must be allowed to get on with its job and base recommendations on clear economic evidence , not political promises			0
' and the @entity166 said : ‘ the minimum wage must not become the subject of a political competition to see who can offer the most , irrespective of what the economy and employers and can afford			0
' the @entity81 has done a good job of balancing the rate against inflation , economic growth , productivity and the effect rises would have on small businesses and young people			0
' in contrast , setting a target linked to average earnings risks seeming a little simplistic … any increase to the minimum wage must be timed carefully , and ultimately reducing the tax burden on both employers and employees will help strengthen the position of those in low paid jobs			1
' mr @entity2 insisted it was not ' anti-business ' , adding : ' he argued it was the @entity8 , not @entity16 , who were seen abroad as a threat to business prospects			0
' i ’m the person who ’s saying we ’ve got to stay in @entity201 , that we ’ve got to reform the @entity202			0
' what ’s the biggest threat to prosperity in this country ? it ’s the potential of a @entity209 government after the next election which has @entity30 turning inwards for two years , deciding whether to exit the @entity202			0

@entity16 would link minimum wage to average earnings to boost low pay
but minimum wage has risen more than average earnings since last election
set to rise to £ 6.50 but would *'ve* been just £ 6.30 under proposal , say *critics*
but if it was *pegged* at 60 *%* of average earnings it would rise by 60p
