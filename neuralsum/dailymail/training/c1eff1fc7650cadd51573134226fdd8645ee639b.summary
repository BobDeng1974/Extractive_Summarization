a series of earthquakes and trembles that have struck in the @entity3 in the past week suggest that an underwater volcano is about to blow			1
the largest of these quakes reached a magnitude of 5.1 off the coast of @entity9 - the smallest island in the @entity10 - and the island is said to have swelled by three inches			1
if the volcano was to erupt , the force could push masses of molten rock to the surface and could subsequently create a new island or islet in the canary chain			1
a 5.1 - magnitude earthquake hit @entity9 in the @entity10 on friday suggesting a nearby underwater volcano could soon erupt			1
this could force rock to emerge from the sea , creating a new island			1
in 2011 , the southern tip of @entity9 was shaken by a 4.3 - magnitude quake and magma appeared off the coast , pictured this @entity31 image shows seismic activity off the southwest coast of @entity9 in 2011 it would also mean all 10,000 residents on the 107 square mile stretch of land would need to be evacuated			1
@entity9 itself was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high			2
according to @entity42 , the @entity43 of the @entity10 , over 550 earthquakes were reported and monitored between monday and @entity44 on wednesday			1
some 30 of these were said to have been a 3 - magnitude quake or higher			1
the majority of these quakes , as well as the swelling on @entity9 , were centred on the region of @entity51 on the south coast of the island			2
the 5.1 - magnitude quake was the strongest ever recorded in the region and its epicenter was said to be around nine miles deep			1
in october 2011 , @entity9 was shaken by a 4.3 - magnitude quake as an underwater volcano started spewing matter 60ft into the air , pictured			1
the island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake in november this year , a powerful volcanic eruption in the @entity66 created a new island off the coast of @entity69 , pictured			2
the mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed @entity75 - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of @entity78 in october 2011 , the same region of @entity9 was shaken by a 4.3 - magnitude quake as an underwater volcano just off the coast started spewing matter 60ft into the air			1
the island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake			0
vast quantities of magma also began bubbling into the sea off the port of @entity51 resulting in its 600 residents being evacuated			0
under the @entity10 lies an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the @entity96 - on which the islands sit - shifts			0
most of the islands are still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller , previously undetected fault line also runs through the chain			0
@entity9 was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high			2
volcanic activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused @entity9 to expand continually			1
the last time it erupted was in 1793			0
some 50,000 years ago , massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a large part of the island to crack off and fall into the @entity3 , according to @entity113			2
that created the @entity116 valley on the island and caused an 300ft - high tsunami that probably reached the @entity120 coast			0
this feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on @entity124 - the most tectonically active of the @entity10 - could trigger a mega-tsunami			0
the theory - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line through the island would cause a major landslide under certain circumstances			0
that landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage all down the @entity3 of the @entity120 , the @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and the east coast of @entity138			0
by december the same year , the eruption was said to be subsiding because the number of tremors and earthquakes decreased			0
this increased again in january 2012 , but by march the authorities on @entity9 declared the eruption threat to be over			2
following the swarm of quakes early last week , @entity9 ’s monitoring agency raised the volcanic eruption risk to ‘ yellow ’			2
following the rise in seismic activity in 2011 , dark brown magma was spotted off the coast of @entity9 , pictured left , near the town of @entity51			1
@entity51 was evacuated and shipping in the area was banned but the activity subsided by march 2012			0
right , a closer image of the magma in the water this computer - generated image shows the underground volcano off the southern-most @entity10 , @entity9 the most recent previous ‘ yellow ’ alert was released in june 2012 , but the volcano failed to erupt then as well			1
in november this year , a powerful volcanic eruption in the @entity66 created a new island off the coast of @entity69			0
the mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed @entity75 - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of @entity78			1
when it first emerged , the new island was 600ft in diameter and appeared next to a small , uninhabited island in the @entity66 called @entity176			0
further eruptions last week , however , have caused the new island to move and join @entity176			0
the last eruption on @entity9 was in 1793 and lasted for a month			2
the last eruption in the @entity10 as a whole took place on the island of @entity124 in 1971			0

in the past week , over 550 earthquakes have struck the @entity3
on friday , a 5.1 - magnitude quake hit the southern tip of @entity9
this seismic activity suggests an underwater volcano could soon erupt
eruption could force masses of rock to the surface , creating a new island
in 2011 , residents were evacuated following *similar* activity but the volcano failed to erupt
