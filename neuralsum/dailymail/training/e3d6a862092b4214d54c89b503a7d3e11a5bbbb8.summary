@entity8 , a popular church organist , suffered ' unsurvivable ' head injuries in the attack @entity19 , 22 , who has already admitted murdering mr @entity8 @entity25 , @entity26 , prosecuting , said : ‘ these two men were walking the streets looking for a suitable victim			1
‘ if it had not been mr @entity8 it would have been someone else			2
‘ they both intended to inflict really serious bodily harm to mr @entity8 and that was exactly what was done to him			2
’ the 22 - year - olds went out in the @entity37 area of @entity15 armed with a pickaxe handle and a hammer or similar weapon after spending hours drinking lager and @entity42 and @entity43 , said mr @entity25			1
@entity45 footage showed them following mr @entity8 closely as he walked to @entity47 , where he had played the organ for more than 40 years			1
the pair then started to run at him before launching an attack at a dimly - lit spot near a park , the court heard			0
but the motive was not robbery as their victim ’s briefcase was left and his pockets not searched , the jury was told			0
mr @entity8 , a grandfather and father of four , was found by a delivery driver a short time later with ‘ catastrophic ’ head injuries			2
he died three days later in hospital			0
the suspected killers ran off through the park and mr @entity25 told jurors that witnesses heard them ‘ laughing together ’			0
when police later released @entity45 footage taken of two suspects near the scene , friends and relatives of the men – described as ‘ virtually brothers ’ – recognised them			0
@entity20 was ‘ faced with no choice ’ but to hand himself in at a police station , jurors were told			1

however , mr @entity25 said both men ‘ were in this together ’ , causing injuries to mr @entity8 similar to those seen in road crash victims			1

a pickaxe handle allegedly used in the assault was later found by police at an address linked to @entity19			2
@entity20 is said to have approached a police officer near the scene four days after the killing and said the crime was a ‘ disgrace ’ and he hoped whoever was responsible would get ‘ hammered in prison for beating up an old man ’			2
@entity20 , who lived in the same suburb of @entity15 as mr @entity8 and his wife @entity80 , also allegedly told an officer he would ‘ grass up ’ the killers if he knew who they were			1
