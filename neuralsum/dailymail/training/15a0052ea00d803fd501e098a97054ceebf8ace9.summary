by @entity1 reporter published : 07:01 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 08:16 est , 17 may 2013 @entity2 with her kitten @entity3 , who survived a full cycle in a washing machine his namesake was a character in @entity9 , the famous novel by @entity11			1
but @entity3 the kitten has proved to be a lord of the @entity14 - after surviving a 30 - minute cycle in a washing machine			1
the eight week - old hid in a pile of laundry to escape the noise of owner @entity2 hoovering			1
ms @entity2 then tipped the load into the washing machine and put it on a full colour wash without spotting her inside			1
she returned to her living room to hoover and half an hour later opened the washing machine - and @entity3 fell unconscious onto the kitchen floor			1
the 22 - year - old picked her up and ran with her to the nearby vets for lifesaving treatment			1
the tortoiseshell kitten was so cold and had so much fluid around her lungs that it took an hour to raise her temperature			1
but after being fitted with a drip she eventually regained consciousness and returned home the same night to be reunited with her brother @entity38			2
ms @entity2 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ' i 'd been hoovering , and the other cats went upstairs to get away from the noise			1
' @entity3 went into the kitchen and must have hopped in			0
i went to pull my washing out and she was just slumped on top of it			2
' when i saw her i was devastated			0
she was meowing so faintly i could barely hear it , and she was hardly breathing			0
it was just so unexpected			0
' i literally just ran into the vets and explained what happened			2
they whisked her off instantly into the back room			0
' we waited and when they came to say she was ok i was so relieved			0
she is practically back to her normal self			0
they said she should n't jump around but she was jumping around just the same			0
it took vets an hour to raise @entity3 's temperature ( pictured with owner @entity2 ) after she fell unconscious @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity40 , where staff treated @entity3 after she survived 30 minutes in a washing machine ' i 'm so grateful to the vets for saving her life			1
' @entity68 , practice manager at @entity69 , in @entity64 , @entity40 , said : ' it took 45 minutes just to register a temperature			2
' she is an amazing little kitten			2
she is like a miracle case			0
we are amazed she survived			0
