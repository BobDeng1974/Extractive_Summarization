by @entity0 if you want to spot a hippopotamus , @entity1 is n't the first country you would consider visiting			1
but if you head around 200 miles of the capital @entity6 and you are likely to see hippos roaming free , and causing problems for the local community			2
the dangerous animals once belonged to notorious drug kingpin @entity11 , who was killed in a shootout with police in 1993			2
and while the rest of the animals in the zoo were relocated following his death , the @entity27 hippos still remain at large			1
while the animals were left on the drug lord 's ranch , they have started venturing further afield , with locals reporting that they are now using a pond near to a local school			1
infamous : @entity25 , about 200 miles north of @entity6 , was @entity11 's hideout some families have even taken in hippo calves and nursed them at home as pets , according to @entity46 newspaper			1
a young girl told the paper : ' my father brought a little one home once			0
i called him @entity52 ( @entity53 ) because he was very sweet â€” we fed him with just milk			0
' the animals , which are known for killing more people per year than lions , elephants , leopards , buffaloes and rhinos combined , are becoming a serious problem			0
@entity65 ecologist @entity64 told the @entity66 : ' it 's just like this crazy wildlife experiment that we 're left with			0
gosh ! i hope this goes well			0
' locals in rural @entity72 , first started reporting hippo sightings in 2007 , and now it is estimated there are between 50 and 60 of the violent animals roaming around the park which was once @entity11 's opulent home			1
museum : burnt - out cars are on display at the ranch which now has exhibitions dedicated to the drug kingpin however , despite a fence supposedly keeping them within the grounds , there have been increasing reports of the hippos bypassing the boundary and venturing into the surrounding area			1
despite not being native to @entity1 , the hippos are thriving , with females giving birth on average to a calf a year - higher than the average in @entity27			2
they are also venturing ever - further , with sightings reported up to 150 miles away as well as complaints from farmers about them destroying crops and even killing cows			1
dangerous : the hippos have found a way out of the ranch and now wander freely through the surrounding countryside the gamekeepers who are responsible for the animals try to keep the hippos close by providing food , but the alpha male - known simply as @entity113 ( the old one ) - has been chasing the younger hippos off , forcing then to venture further away and form their own herds			2
despite being rundown , @entity116 has reopened as an adventure park with a @entity120 theme , and touts itself as a family - friendly destination , despite its narcotic links			0
more animals are on order and giant dinosaur statues , commissioned by @entity11 for his son , are also on display			0
the building at the ranch also has a museum dedicated to the drug trafficker .			0

@entity134 smuggled into @entity1 for drug baron 's *private* zoo

locals report sightings as far as 150 miles away as hippo population soars
