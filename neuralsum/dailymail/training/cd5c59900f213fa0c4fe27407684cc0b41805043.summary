it is a surreal sight			2
hundreds of people running in the cold , pitch - black of a mid-autumn night , their faces lit from below by neon bands on their arms			2
and in the middle of this mass of humanity is 39 - year - old solicitor @entity11 , running on her own , glossy jet - black hair streaming down her back and tears running down her face			1
‘ i call it my 10k run and cry , ’ she says			0
she is taking part in @entity20 , a five and ten - kilometre race launched four years ago after @entity11 ’s fiance , 38 - year - old blind adventurer @entity21 , fell out of a two - storey - high window in 2010			1
he broke his back in three places and is paralysed from the waist down			1
the run takes place in 45 cities across the world and raises money for research into a cure for paralysis			0
a film about @entity11 and @entity21 , called @entity38 : the @entity39 ( released in @entity40 and coming to the @entity41 in the @entity42 ) , tells how they have overcome seemingly impossible hurdles			1
light in the dark : blind athlete @entity21 , 38 , pictured with fiance @entity11 , fell out of a two - storey - high window in 2010 , broke his back in three places , and is now paralysed from the waist down originally from @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity40 , @entity21 was five when he went blind in one eye aged five from a retinal detachment			1
this occurs when the retina comes free from the inner part of the eyeball			0
the problem affected his other eye when he was 22			1
in spite of two desperate operations to save his sight , he went completely blind			1
he subsequently forged a successful career as a motivational speaker and adventurer			2
@entity11 and @entity21 met when he took up salsa dancing and she , a solicitor , offered to help him learn			1
they were just four weeks away from marrying when @entity21 suffered his catastrophic accident			1
@entity11 has said that back then , she did n’t worry about @entity21 following his heart on extreme adventures , because he was so well prepared			1
‘ it is normally the mundane that gets you , ’ she said			0
and that ’s exactly what happened			0
@entity21 had been staying in a house with friends visiting @entity77 for the famous regatta when he decided to have an early night and went up to bed alone			1
walking tall : @entity21 in the @entity81 bionic suit @entity11 was in @entity40 , planning their big day			1
inexplicably , @entity21 fell from his bedroom window and crash - landed on to concrete , fracturing his skull and breaking his spine			1
to this day , he has no idea how it happened			0
he spent 16 months in hospital			0
so marriage plans were put on hold and @entity11 found herself taking a year - long sabbatical and spending day after day sitting by @entity21 ’s bedside			1
the spinal cord relays movement commands from the brain as well as sensory information back from the body up to the brain			2
it also controls certain automatic sensory information back from the body to the brain , and affects some automatic bodily functions such as breathing , sweating and regulating the body ’s blood pressure			0
with a diagnosis of complete spinal - cord injury , @entity21 had no significant movement or feeling below his belly button			1
although he believed he might pick up on his adventuring again , albeit in a wheelchair , a training trip to @entity113 made him realise that this was not possible			0
‘ i did n’t get the same buzz , ’ he mourns			0
‘ i was being helped too much			0
finding a cure for paralysis has become my adventure			0
’ @entity11 says : ‘ i read literature about his condition almost from the moment he was in hospital			1
‘ when @entity21 ’s @entity128 team - mate , @entity127 , came to see him , i noticed that he was reading a book about neuroplasticity – how the brain and central nervous system are ‘ ‘ plastic ’ ’ and capable of change			1
it may be one of the keys to helping paralysed people			0
’ @entity127 offered to help @entity21 with physical training			1
‘ without that , i think we would have given up on our quest , ’ says @entity11			1
‘ it ’s hard enough going to the gym at the best of times , never mind when it takes three hours to get up , have a shower and get out of the door			0
’ @entity21 points out that in order to cure paralysis , we need to be aware of the unpleasant realities that come with it , such as lack of bladder control			2
and he gives an example to show how his paralysis affects every single moment of the couple ’s lives			0
‘ if i want to turn over in bed at night , i have to be physically wide awake and use my arms to lift up my legs , and then i disturb @entity11			2
’ following a fundraising drive , @entity21 became the first person to have his own £ 100,000 @entity167 exoskeleton suit , which allows him to walk , with support			2
‘ now i can hug my girlfriend , ’ he says			0
he already holds the accolade of being the first blind person to reach the @entity128 on foot , and has also won two @entity174 medals for rowing			0
he and @entity11 travelled to @entity176 earlier this year to take part in a ground - breaking experiment			1
‘ scientists from a number of disciplines are looking at a cocktail of treatments for paralysis , ’ he explains			0
‘ this is a combination of therapies , including robotics , electrical stimulation and drugs			0
’ he has volunteered himself to help the scientists in their quest			0
@entity11 adds : ‘ this is exciting stuff , this quest for a cure			2
and @entity21 does the hard stuff – the training , the drugs and the rehab			2
‘ even if these interventions do n’t help @entity21 , we hope to contribute to science which helps others			2
’ @entity202 is an acknowledgment of their current situation , and the atmosphere is electric with hope for the future			0
‘ the first year we did it was in @entity209 and it was raining so hard , ’ recalls @entity11			1
‘ a man came over and told us that his baby had a spinal injury – hearing about @entity21 ’s struggle was keeping him going			2
’ @entity214 takes place on november 12 in five official locations			0
