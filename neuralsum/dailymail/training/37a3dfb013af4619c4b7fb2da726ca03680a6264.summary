a swirl of swallows , passing through from deep in @entity2 to the distant north , zipped around the windows of the @entity6 restaurant on the 27th floor of the @entity8			0
it is one of the more delicate wonders of @entity12 , communing at eye level with a supreme athlete of the skies			1
i 'm sure these birds have already updated the migratory map imprinted in their navigation system			0
after all , this sumptuous landmark in the shape of a yacht with billowing sail , where @entity24 and @entity25 once famously played tennis on the helipad , already qualifies as , if not quite ' old ' , then certainly well - established			2
it 's been here all of 15 years , one of @entity12 's few trophy buildings from the @entity31			1
@entity6 is arabic for @entity32 , but that superlative is so widely bestowed in @entity12 these days ( world 's tallest building , and biggest airport , with the ambition to be the world 's most visited city - beating @entity39 - by 2020 ) that we may soon have to think of new ones			1
now others do something similar			0
so i would suggest ' best ' high tea with scones and @entity64 clotted cream , and champagne cocktail with gold dust , served under the world 's highest atrium ( 590ft )			1
@entity70 though it is , touristic @entity12 already has dates in its social calendar to rival some of the most famous of the world 's grand hotel occasions , such as afternoon tea at @entity76 's in @entity77 and cocktails at @entity79 in @entity80			1
tea at @entity55 is one			0
friday brunch in the @entity12 is another			1
i would add an event of my own : a drink at dusk on my ninth - floor balcony in @entity12 's @entity79 , to take in the whole of that crazy , magnificent , skyline			1
let 's reduce the appeal of @entity12 to this			1
it 's the most brazen , fast - moving , outrageous , exciting and most rapidly updated visitor experience in the world			1
that view from @entity96 was n't possible ten years ago			2
this hotel did n't exist ; that skyline was n't there			0
and i 'm sure things have changed even since my visit			0
do n't look down ! @entity24 and @entity25 played tennis on the @entity8 's helipad in 2005 @entity103 hit : @entity24 hits a ball out to sea from the @entity8 's helipad during his match with @entity25 @entity12 has done all this frantic building because it wants to base its future on tourism and events such as the @entity111 , @entity112 and international cricket , and its financial sector			1
unlike its richer neighbour @entity117 , this emirate never had much oil , and its reserves could be gone by the next decade			0
its next big target is @entity121 and we can expect it to be unlike anything we have seen before			1
on one level you could simply treat @entity12 as a conventional winter break			1
a stroll along the strand with your feet in the @entity130 in february is certainly a great antidote to the @entity133 winter			0
lavish : @entity12 's @entity79 makes a good stab at impersonating @entity135 all that glitters : the @entity79 's gold and marbled lobby and , right , its stylish bar but walking out on to the beach from a high - end hotel is an option available around the world , and it 's easy to forget where you are			1
in @entity12 you never do			2
inside and out it makes a good stab at impersonating @entity135			0
the only other place on @entity151 where they do so much gold and marble and huge vaulted space , and with such attention to detail , is @entity158			0
the best way to make sense of @entity12 is to ride the elevated @entity161			1
it 's brand new , obviously , with seductively curved and gilded stations			2
completed in just five years , it connects the airport to a stop close to the major hotels			2
we crammed into the front of the driverless train to snap the 2014 edition of the towering skyscape			2
@entity173 : the 2,716ft @entity174 is the world 's tallest building and gives stunning views over @entity12 , right twenty - first century travel : the best way to make sense of @entity12 is to ride the elevated @entity161 there is a better vantage point still for photographs , from the world 's highest building , the 2,716ft @entity174 , which is the most unreal structure i 've ever seen			1
after a 120 - floor , two - minute , nonstop lift ride we emerged on to the viewing platform			2
this is as high as some geographers ' definition of a mountain			0
while @entity117 is building its future around worldclass museums , including outposts of the @entity196 and the @entity197 , @entity12 prefers to mark its forward march with pure wow and wonder			1
and it is doing it at a rapid rate			1
this was my third visit in seven years , and i 'm seeing a new @entity12			1
to put this in perspective , imagine visiting @entity208 at its peak , then returning a little later to find they had built a @entity211 bigger and grander than the original			0
so @entity12 has the new @entity213 , already partly open			1
on completion it will be the world 's largest passenger and cargo hub			1
up to four aircraft will be able to land simultaneously , 24 hours a day , on parallel runways			0
@entity220 meets modern : @entity222 ferries still sail up and down @entity223 @entity12 is a blur of nationalities			2
the mixologist who gave me my cocktail - making lesson in @entity12 the @entity229 was @entity230			1
the singer was from @entity232			0
the senior staff we spoke to in hotels were @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241			0
the real @entity242 were more likely to be swishing grandly in their dishdashas out of @entity244 in the @entity245 , or standing outside a hotel restaurant , waiting for the valet to deliver the @entity248			0
that sums up how far @entity12 has come since the days when tribesmen of the @entity252 family measured their wealth against the bounty the pearls divers brought up out of the shallow seas			2
but some things do n't change			0
you can still wander down to the @entity223 and , for 20p , take the noisy , smokey and utterly authentic abra ferry			0
every time i return , i visit this ancient tableau of open wooden boats scooting over this narrow inlet with foreboding			0
have they ' modernised ' the @entity223 ? i 'm delighted to report that , apart from every offduty boatman being busy on his smartphone , no they have n't			0
in its fast and furious dash to the future , i think @entity12 will be true to its past			1
