we are here this week to carry our voice into the political arena			2
¿ and , asked when he would ‘ bring back socialism ’ , he replied : ‘ that ’s what we are doing			1
it is about fighting the battle for economic equality , for social equality and for gender equality too			2
‘ that is a battle that is not yet won in our country			0
’ mr @entity14 said @entity4 would scrap the @entity38 ’ free schools policy and force primaries to stay open for longer to offer ‘ wraparound ’ childcare from 8am to 6pm			1
however , his remarks did not appear to appease @entity4 ’s union backers , who have clashed with him over his plans to reform their relationship with the party			1
‘ we are certainly not going to accept any advice on democracy and transparency from the people who brought us the cash for honours scandals , ’ said @entity49 boss @entity48			0
promises : mr @entity14 made a pitch to the @entity17 at the weekend by promising a mansion tax , a higher minimum wage and monitoring of how many women appear on tv at a fringe event , mr @entity6 suggested @entity4 must show it is following the unions ’ agenda or his union would pull its support , saying : ‘ my challenge to @entity14 is to make it clear that the @entity4 is the party of working people , is the party of organised labour			1

demonstrate that you ’re on our side			0
’ the @entity13 leader called on anti-austerity campaigners to rise up , drawing a bizarre parallel with the @entity84 , which he said showed ‘ people power can bring down dictators ’			1
he also condemned ‘ evil ’ capitalism ’ and @entity4 for backing the principle of flexible markets			1
mr @entity48 , meanwhile , said the union link would not be ‘ washed away for an electoral gimmick ’			2
he insisted that a dilution of the unions ’ collective voice in the @entity4 was simply ‘ not on the agenda ’			2
mr @entity14 is facing a further potential blow from the unions today when @entity98 attempts to overturn his policy on public sector pay			1

mr @entity14 wants union members to opt into party membership rather than be automatically affiliated			1
debate : @entity49 boss @entity48 has clashed with mr @entity14 over his attempts to appease @entity4 's union backers but mr @entity48 , who announced plans this month to slash funding to @entity4 by £ 1million a year in protest at the reforms , said : ‘ we can expand ad infinitum the number of people we bring into the tent , but if what they say is ignored , as has been the case in the past , in favour of dinner party babble , then why bother ? ’ mr @entity48 , who received a standing ovation from union leaders inside the hall , urged mr @entity14 to focus on bread - and - butter issues such as jobs and living standards , saying the public ‘ do not give a fig ’ about party funding			1
a special conference will be held next march on whether the planned reforms will be accepted			2
share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			0
petri , @entity142 , @entity143 , 1 day ago the unions should be reformed so that sub-par clowns like @entity146 would not ever be anywhere near a position of power			0
it should be quite simple , actually : change the laws so that the right to strike is tied with voting in the unions ' leadership elections			0
if you still go on strike without the right to do so , it would be grounds for an immediate an automatic dismissal			0
( this should apply to all illegal strikes			0
) sick of @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity143 , 1 day ago " it 's our party " those three words tell you all you need to know in order to avoid liebor like the plague			2
vote @entity171 - how much worse could it be @entity173 , @entity174 , 1 day ago if you want to put a rocket up @entity14 donate a few £ million to @entity171 that will get his undivided attention			1
@entity178 , @entity179 , 1 day ago the unions & labour forget that out of 26 million people in work , only 6 million belong to a union			2
they are thinking off the day , in the future , when if you dont have a little red book you dont get a job or food. , dream on baby @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity143 , 1 day ago what is it about the current gang of union leaders that gives the clear impression of inept self serving individuals who would be ridiculed if they had to enter the workplace they so miserably claim to defend			2
@entity202 , @entity203 , 1 day ago for @entity204 , @entity205 ...			0
and while our boys were fighting and dying in @entity209 , they brought the miners out on strike to put pressure on the government to open a second front to help ` our fellow communists ` ... ie : @entity217			0
keith , beijing , @entity219 , 1 day ago trade unions are a cancer @entity222 , lndn , @entity143 , 1 day ago mr @entity14 made a pitch to the @entity17 at the weekend by promising a mansion tax , a higher minimum wage and monitoring of how many women appear on tv			1
* * * * such world shaking issues pity none of them will work and the last is just ridiculous			0
what is a mansion ? people who are only rich in property not cash will downsize and take the once only capital gains hit which will work out cheaper			0
this tax will not even pay politicians expenses and will shrink as people move to avoid it so the value of properties eligible will be lowered to copensate			0
our heritage historical properties that bring tourists will become bankrupt			2
higher minimum wage , if minimum wage goes up everyone earning more will want a parity increase and the unions will be the first in line demanding that parity is maintained causing inflation monitoring of how many women appear on tv , why ? who cares except for a few left wing minority groups			0
the @entity260 being uber pc does that already even to the detriment of quality			0
@entity222 , lndn , @entity143 , 1 day ago asked when he would ¿ bring back socialism ¿ , he replied : ¿ that ¿ s what we are doing			1
it is about fighting the battle for economic equality , for social equality and for gender equality too			0
* * * * * * * * * what is economic equality , everyone being paid the same as in equal , how will that work ? it will not be worth spending years training for anything difficult if everyone is paid the same			0
social equality , everyone a clone living on council estates , just what does that phrase mean ? gender equality fair enough assuming there will be no allowances whatever made for gender differences such as pregnancy either			0
does this twit really understand the meaning of the word equality ? unless he is referring to the type of equality they have in @entity300 and that is only an illusion people are still treated differently there are still social and financial layers these words are just meaningless sound bites for the benefit of his hard line socialist followers			0
@entity311 , @entity312 , 1 day ago it 's your party ... ah , yes , financed by obligatory ' donations ' from your union members many of whom do no support the @entity4 nor would wish to donate			1
