@entity1 does everything in his @entity14 home with bottled water - washing , cleaning and even flushing the toilet for less than the cost of his previous monthly bill			1
the 25 - year - old 's brave decision came after @entity23 asked him for a £ 14 per month standing charge , and so instead of paying up he asked them to cut off his supply			1
he now is now saving cash by buying water in bulk from the supermarket , which he says more than enough for him and his two - year - old dog @entity32			1
@entity1 cleans himself using baby wipes and bottled water each day and pops to friends ' houses or the gym to use a shower			1
to avoid any washing up he drinks and eats using disposable cups , plates and cutlery			0
the cash he is saving will help him pay for the redecoration of his home , he says			0
' it 's been fantastic for me			0
it has saved me money , ' he told @entity50			0
' in april i used one unit of water , and they charged me £ 16 including a £ 14 standing charge so i asked them to cut me off			1
' when i need the loo i just take the dog bowl and use that to flush the loo and put more bottled water into the dog bowl for her to drink			2
this means the dog gets fresh bottled water all day			0
' in the morning i wake up and use baby wipes i bought in bulk to clean myself and in the evening i have a strip - down wash			0

his best week was last week - £ 3.66			2
mr @entity1 , who works from home and runs a self - harm support charity , also decided to cut off his gas supply after his boiler broke and he did n't have the £ 1,000 to replace it			1

i also try to live in one room			0
' my electricity bill is now £ 4 per week and i want to get it lower '			2
@entity1 's entrepreneurial skills have already hit the headlines after he turned the tables on the cold - callers by setting up his own premium rate phone number – and has since pocketed £ 300 as a result			1
cheers ! @entity1 says by buying water by the case he has more than enough to drink , make cups of tea and coffee and make food clever : the 25 - year - old says his new cheaper life is ' fantastic ' and he eats items that only require a kettle good health : the entrepreneur says that his dentist has told him that his teeth have got better since he starting using only mineral water technique : @entity1 cleans himself with baby wipes , bottles water or grabs a shower at a friend 's house or at the gym remarkable : the young man has even set - up his own 0871 number to make money from cold - callers washing : cleans with bottled water , baby wipes and showers at friends or at the gym eating and drinking : items like tea , coffee porridge , pasta or noodles made in plastic pots or cups using boiling water going to the loo : he uses water from the dog bowl to flush the toilet heating : has bought warmer duvet , has an electric blanket washing up : @entity1 uses disposable items that can be thrown away when used or broken the 25 - year - old paid £ 10 plus vat to set up a personal 0871 landline and now makes money every time he receives an unsolicited phone call			1
he said it was ‘ extremely easy ’ to set up the number online			0
he chose an 0871 number because it was more profitable than one starting with 0845 or 0844			2
mr @entity1 said he gave out the premium rate number whenever he needed to talk to utility companies but had a separate line for his friends and family to call			2
‘ i was getting annoyed at the @entity180 calls i was constantly getting so i thought there must be a way to make money out of them , ’ he said			0
‘ i decided i would get an 08 number and realised if i had an 0871 number they would be charged 10p a minute			2
@entity50 has asked @entity23 to comment on his case			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

only uses electricity after cutting off gas as he could n't *afford* a new boiler
has set up his own 0871 number to make cash from irritating cold - callers
