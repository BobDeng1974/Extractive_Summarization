it 's a pivotal policy for the @entity1 but questions are being asked of the prime minister 's understanding , or lack thereof , around metadata after his bizarre claim that he never worried about police looking into his , when he was a journalist			1
the problem with his attempt to allay fears of the modern day media is that metadata was hardly a player when @entity16 was reporting in the 1980s and early 90s , before the advent of the @entity18			1
' in the days when i was a journalist there were no metadata protections for journalists , ' he stated to a gathering of reporters on wednesday			1
but if you do the math , his argument simply does not stack up			0
i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that @entity31 police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister said			1
his writing career ended before the internet began while metadata does include some traditional methods of investigation ; including phone numbers and length and time of calls , the overhaul 's main thrust is aimed at computer based functions , particularly the online and email world			1
the @entity18 came to be , effectively , in 1992			1
full text searches were not available for two years after that and email access came to being about the same time			0
by then , @entity16 was well and truly ensconced as press secretary to opposition leader dr @entity51 , his days as a writer for @entity53 and the @entity31 all but over			2
' i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that @entity31 police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister said			1
' a contested warrant is more like a court case and if you had to have a court case to access metadata , well , the whole process would absolutely gum up , ' he said			0
in trying to explain the planned two - year retention , mr @entity16 has previously stated that he believed metadata to be the ' sites you 're visiting '			1
' it 's not what you are doing on the internet , it 's the site 's you are visiting , it 's not the content it 's just where you have been			0
' it 's the person you are sending it to , the person sending it , it 's the date and the place it 's posted from			0
' @entity84 had earlier agreed to support new metadata laws with amendments			1
the government bill , which is expected to pass parliament by the end of next week , forces telecommunications companies to keep two years of customer data , such as the time and length of a phone call			0
the laws would allow for warrant-less access by government agencies			2
the government has agreed to a number of @entity84 amendments , including better protections for journalists			2
@entity104 chairman @entity103 , has expressed his concern the laws could crush investigative journalism and dissuade whistle - blowers from coming forward			1
' a healthy democratic society requires robust free speech and a free and vigorous press to hold governments and other powerful interests to account , ' he said			0
' i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that @entity31 police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister told the @entity121 media gallery metadata is the footprint left by electronic communications			1
the worry for journalists is that sources might be hesitant to come forward knowing that metadata could lead investigators to their door			2
' these are not hypothetical concerns , ' professor @entity103 said			0
he said governments were increasingly chasing down leaks and stripping away whistle - blower protections			0
' these legitimate concerns can not be addressed effectively short of exempting journalists and media organisations			0
' attorney - general @entity139 had previously said that in a ' newly dangerous age ' it was vital that those protecting @entity31 were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed a parliamentary committee recommended in february the laws be passed , but called for safeguards for journalists			2
it recommended the issue of protecting journalists ' sources be referred to a separate inquiry to report to parliament within three months			2
attorney - general @entity139 had previously said that in a ' newly dangerous age ' it was vital that those protecting @entity31 were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed			0
the government wants the regime legislated this month .			0

prime minister says journalists should not hold any fear of the new metadata laws giving up sources
@entity16 said police accessing his metadata when he was a journalist in the 80s and early 90s was never a problem
the @entity18 and email did not come to be until 1992 - just as @entity16 's reporting career was coming to a close
the government 's proposed laws focus heavily on the retention of users ' computer footprints
