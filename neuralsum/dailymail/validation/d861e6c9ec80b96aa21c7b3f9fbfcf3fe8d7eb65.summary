for fans of @entity3 's breakfast menu who have dreamed of the day it was served outside of morning hours , the time has come ... but only as a test run in @entity7			1
select locations will serve all - day breakfast with the partial menu featuring some of the chain 's breakfast sandwiches and hash browns			1
the exact sandwiches have not been revealed			0
depending on how successful the test is , the chain could expand the all - day breakfast menu to other markets , according to @entity29			1
last month , the fast - food chain began looking at how it could make breakfast available later in the day , said @entity33 , head of @entity34			1
offering both the breakfast menu past 10.30am alongside the lunch menu had been considered logistically impossible , given the tight kitchen spaces of the restaurants			1
@entity3 's even tweeted about the topic in february , saying it does not serve breakfast all day because its grills ' just are n't big enough for breakfast and lunch			0
' on their website in response to why they do not serve breakfast all day the company wrote : ' here ’s the thing : it comes down to the sheer size of kitchen grills			0
' they simply do n’t have the room for all of our menu options at one time — especially considering we use our grill to prepare many items on our breakfast menu			2
' the push to make breakfast available outside normal hours partly reflects how @entity16 is working to keep pace with shifting habits			0
in particular , executives have noted that customers increasingly want foods personalized to their tastes and schedules			0
breakfast also accounts for about 25percent of sales at @entity16 , and is the strongest part of the day for the chain , according to the @entity76			2
if the test is successful , @entity16 could expand the all - day breakfast menu to other markets ' we look forward to learning from this test , and it 's premature to speculate on any outcomes , ' wrote spokeswoman @entity84 in an email , according to @entity86			1
' we 're excited to serve our customers in this area some of @entity3 's great - tasting breakfast sandwiches , hash browns and other favorites all day long			1
' @entity3 's said on monday that it was too early to speculate on any outcomes from the test			0
@entity95 had released an analyst note earlier and said that their industry sources had told them @entity3 's planned to test all - day breakfast in the @entity99 the analyst note was released before @entity3 's confirmed the report			2
' having those breakfast items available to sell all day would also serve as a reminder to customers ( and the media			0
) that @entity3 's does indeed have craveable food to sell , ' @entity95 analyst @entity107 wrote .			0

fast - food chain will begin test in april at select locations in @entity7
the partial menu will feature some breakfast sandwiches and hash browns
