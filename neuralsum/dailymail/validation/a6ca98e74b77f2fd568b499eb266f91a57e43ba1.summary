officials say they remain ‘ hopeful ’ of a deal but expect a day of ‘ brinkmanship ’ with @entity2 trying to win concessions on crippling @entity9 sanctions in return for agreeing to limits that would prevent @entity12 from producing enough fuel for a nuclear weapon within a year			1
foreign secretary @entity16 stressed as he arrived in @entity17 for the talks : ‘ we are here because we believe a deal can be done but it has to be a deal which puts the bomb beyond @entity2 's reach			1
@entity43 prime minister @entity42 , who has campaigned vehemently against the negotiations , said in @entity45 that the agreement being put together in @entity17 sends the message ‘ that @entity2 stands to gain by its aggression ’			1
the six - nation group is offering a package of relief measures , lifting the @entity53 oil embargo and removing banking restrictions , in moves synchronised with the suspension of corresponding @entity32 sanctions			1
but it insists that some @entity9 sanctions must stay in place until @entity2 has convinced the international community it has no intention of pursuing a weapons programme , something that could take many years			2
@entity2 appears unwilling to compromise further , its supreme leader , @entity65 , has left them no negotiating space insisting yesterday : ‘ sanctions must be lifted in one go , not as a result of future @entity2 actions			2
’ a @entity73 diplomat warned : ‘ there are still some quite important gaps , ’ amid warnings that ‘ an agreement is far from certain			0

’ much appears to hinge on @entity2 ’s willingness to sacrifice a considerable proportion of its 9,900 working centrifuges and export a large amount of its 7.9 tons of low - enriched uranium			0
the @entity32 and its @entity101 allies want a mechanism that would allow suspended @entity9 sanctions to be put back into effect rapidly if @entity2 reneges on a deal			1
@entity34 reportedly accepts this , but wants to ensure its @entity108 veto rights are protected			0
@entity34 ’s foreign minister @entity109 announced he was to break - off from @entity17 to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate			1
his officials appeared more optimistic than many of an agreement			0
@entity34 ’s foreign minister @entity109 ( pictured right ) announced he was to break - off from @entity17 to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate despite deep disagreements on several points , @entity73 officials said the two sides had previously been closing in on a preliminary deal that could be summarized in a brief document which may or may not be released			1
officials said the talks could run at least until the deadline of midnight on tuesday or beyond			0

@entity12 , which denies it is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability , demands in exchange for limits on its atomic activities a swift end to sanctions			0
