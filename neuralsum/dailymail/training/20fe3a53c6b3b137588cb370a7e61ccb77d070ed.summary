by @entity0 a ship which sank during a violent storm a century ago has been found largely intact at the bottom of a lake by a group of divers			2
the @entity8 freighter went down in @entity9 , @entity10 after sailing into the @entity11 of november 1913			1
the @entity12 reported on sunday that shipwreck hunters found the boat last month in about 535 feet of water off the shore of @entity17			1
courtesy of @entity19 secrets of the deep : the ' flying bridge ' of a previously undiscovered shipwreck in @entity9 about 30 miles north of @entity17 , @entity10 almost 100 years after the boat is believed to have sunk in a huge storm watery grave : the @entity27 was a steel - hulled , propeller - driven lake freighter which sunk in 1913 , killing all 25 crew on board the group says it has n't seen the name of the ship on the wreck yet , but all signs indicate it 's the @entity8 , sitting amid a spilled load of iron ore			1
' it 's the most satisfying find of my shipwreck - hunting career , ' said @entity42 , of @entity43 , part of the group that has found many lost ships in recent years			1
' it 's a fantastic find , ' said maritime historian @entity48 , of @entity17 , who has written about the @entity8			1
' i 'm excited at the opportunity to look at the video and see if we can learn the cause of the wreck , to write the final chapter of the ship			0
' the @entity8 and its crew of 25 disappeared after sailing into the @entity11 of 1913			1
the storm , one of the biggest on the lakes , wrecked more than a dozen ships and killed about 250 sailors			0
the @entity8 was safe in the @entity17 harbor on november 7 and 8 , and loading iron ore , but on the evening of november 9 , captain @entity65 decided to leave port for @entity67			1
hidden depths : the shores of @entity70 where shipwreck hunters recently found a boat believed to have sank 100 years ago ' the lake was still rolling , but there seemed to be a lull in the wind , the velocity having dropped to 32 mph , " shipwreck expert and longtime @entity80 professor @entity78 wrote in @entity81			1
' the gale ... should have blown itself out			0
but , this was no conventional storm			0
in taking his vessel out of the safety of @entity86 , captain @entity65 sailed into eternity			0
' sailors on other boats reported seeing @entity8 deckhands battening down hatches as it went onto the open lake , @entity48 wrote in his book , went missing			1
other witnesses watched the ship make a turn to port , as if @entity65 had decided to head back to shore			2
then the @entity8 vanished - and entered @entity101 lore as a ' ghost ship '			1
calm exterior : the @entity104 of @entity9			2
the 1913 storm is legendary in the area , wrecking more than a dozen ships and killing 250 sailors @entity19 is n't revealing exactly how his group found the @entity8 , because he hopes to use the same method to find other wrecks			1
but he said it was n't a case of merely running a grid pattern over the lake in hopes of getting lucky			0
he said the group used a culmination of hunches , research and data to pinpoint a specific search area			0
the data pointed them toward a possible wreck about 30 miles north of @entity17 , and the hunters found the @entity8 just 20 minutes after dropping a sonar unit into the water			1
an underwater camera captured enough detail in videos and photos to convince the group that they found the @entity8			1
' a number of wrecks we 've found have been over the span of 20 years searching , multiple times a year , ' said @entity139 , a member of the hunting group from @entity141 , @entity142			2
' going and finding a wreck 20 - some miles offshore in the span of a couple hours is extraordinary			0
' fellow hunter @entity146 , of @entity147 , said it appears the ship is broken in the middle but largely intact in the front			0
the stern has more damage , @entity146 said			0
' it 's a beautiful wreck ' with great visibility , he said			0
' no zebra mussels ; clean			0
' the crew will return to the site this summer in hopes of getting more questions answered			0
but the group is already starting to piece together events that led to the @entity8 's demise			2
' it 's very clear to me that this one appeared to have broken on the surface , spilled its iron ore contents over the bottom , and then landed on the iron ore , ' said @entity19 , who had been considering retiring from wreck hunting partly because he was n't expecting any more significant finds on @entity9			2
' this was a gift from the lake gods , ' @entity19 said .			0
