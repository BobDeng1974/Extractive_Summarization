@entity0 yesterday called on @entity1 to ‘ junk talk of austerity ’ and pump more money into big spending projects amid fears the economy could be heading towards a triple dip recession			1
the plea from one of the @entity12 ’s most prominent figures came after bleak figures from the @entity14 showed output fell 0.3 per cent between october and december			1
this weaker than expected performance left @entity18 experts predicting an unprecedented triple dip recession , while others said the downturn is now worse than the @entity22 of the 1930s			0
and in a sign of coalition tensions over the flatlining economy , @entity40 made clear the @entity44 will demand higher capital spending on infrastructure projects in the next public spending review – a shot across mr @entity1 ’s bows			1
the @entity14 said the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last three months of 2012 , which meant there was no growth overall last year construction grew by 0.3 per cent , but not enough to make up for sharp drops in the last year @entity57 chief economist @entity56 said the @entity58 in march would be a good time to slow the pace of austerity the slump rounded off the worst four - year period for the @entity64 economy , excluding the aftermath of war , since the 1830s			1
it is feared it could be followed by another quarter of decline at the start of this year , which would mean @entity64 was in recession again			2
the @entity14 report said that the @entity64 economy did not grow at all in 2012 and has now shrunk for four of the last five quarters , with the only growth coming between july and september when output rose 0.9 per cent with the help of the @entity76			1
the economy is still 3.3 per cent below its pre-crisis peak in 2008 and fears are mounting that @entity64 will be stripped of its coveted @entity81 credit rating as tax receipts dwindle and debts soar			0
addressing @entity64 business leaders at the @entity85 in @entity86 , mr @entity0 called for a change of tack from the government			1
‘ we need to junk talk of austerity and recognise that the single biggest inhibitor of demand is lack of confidence , and that if only some of the people in this room would invest some of the cash in their balance sheets we would see that confidence rewarded in a virtuous circle , ’ he said			2
he attacked the downbeat rhetoric emerging from both the @entity105 and the @entity36 and alluded to the painful age of austerity overseen by post war @entity109 chancellor sir @entity108			1
the sharp drop in output was caused mostly by contraction in production , wiping out a small rise in construction ‘ i do n’t think austerity is a terribly useful concept in this sort of climate , ’ he said			0
‘ the hair shirt stuff , the @entity108 agenda , that is not the way to get @entity64 motoring again			0
’ mr @entity0 said he backed the chancellor ’s plans to cut the deficit but said more cuts would need to be found to invest in housing and infrastructure			1
mr @entity40 warned that ‘ there is some way to go before the recovery really takes root ’ and conceded that it would be ‘ a long , painstaking job before the @entity64 economy fully recovers ’			2
a day earlier he admitted in an interview that the government should not have cut capital spending so much when it first came to power			2
aides said he is not challenging the chancellor ’s overall levels of government spending			2
but they said he will argue for even more capital expenditure on infrastructure projects in the next spending round			0
‘ this is a priority for us , ’ one said			0
but speaking in @entity86 yesterday , mr @entity1 insisted he would not change course			0
‘ we have a reminder today that @entity64 faces a very difficult economic situation , ’ he said			0
‘ a reminder that last year was particularly difficult , that we face problems at home because of the debts built up over many years and problems abroad with the eurozone , where we export most of our products , in recession			0

@entity14 *announces* *negative* growth for final quarter of last year
results mean there was no growth overall for the whole of 2012
@entity40 admits government was *wrong* to cut *funding* for big building projects , *damaging* jobs and growth
@entity0 says it is time to ' junk the rhetoric of austerity '
@entity57 chief economist says the chancellor should use the @entity58 in march to ' take stock ' and change course
experts warn of longest depression in living *memory*
