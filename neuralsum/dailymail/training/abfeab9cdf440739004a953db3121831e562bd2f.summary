a disgraced @entity1 doctor who killed a @entity3 man by injecting him with a massive dose of painkillers is now suing a @entity7 author because he mentioned the incident in his book			1
@entity10 killed @entity11 after giving him ten times the correct amount of diamorphine at his home in @entity15 while he was working a locum			1
he is already trying to sue the victim 's son for branding him a killer despite a coroner ruling the death was manslaughter			1
now he wants judges at @entity24 to rule against author dr @entity25 , claiming that no mention should be made again of the incident or that he is @entity1 by birth			0
legal action : @entity1 doctor @entity10 ( left ) is suing @entity7 author dr @entity25 ( right ) for mentioning the fact that he killed a @entity3 patient by injecting him with ten times the correct dose of painkillers dr @entity25 , 50 , who currently has a book at number three in the bestselling chart in @entity7 called ' @entity39 ' , is aghast at the lawsuit which he promises to fight ' tooth and nail			1
' he said : ' if i was dr @entity10 , i would be ashamed to be involved in this after what he did			2
' at first , my publisher and i laughed when we got his lawyer 's letter , but he is deadly serious			0
' he thinks no mention should ever be made again of his mistake which caused a man to die			0
' @entity10 's latest attempt to silence anyone who mentions the incident comes at a time when he is still involved in litigation against dr @entity57 , son of the man he killed , who also lives in @entity7			1
@entity10 , who lives in the west @entity7 industrial town of @entity60 , went to the @entity3 in 2008 as a locum because he wanted extra money			1
he was working for an out - of - hours medical service when he gave 70 - year - old mr @entity11 a fatal injection in @entity15			2
@entity10 confused the amount of painkiller he should give renal patient mr @entity11 and injected him with ten times the dosage of diamorphine he should have done			1
mr @entity11 died within minutes at his home in @entity71 , @entity15 , on 16 february 2008			2
dr @entity10 is seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation from dr @entity25 over a passage in his 2011 book called ' @entity76 ' ( above ) which mentions the incident in which he killed @entity11 in 2008 coroner @entity78 later ruled his death ' gross negligence and manslaughter ' and issued 11 recommendations to the @entity83 for the improvement of out - of - hours gp services			1
an arrest warrant was issued in the @entity3 for @entity10 to be extradited to stand trial			1
but he cut a dubious deal with @entity7 prosecutors that allowed him to receive a fine - by post - together with a nine - month suspended jail sentence for causing death by negligence			1
his ability to work in @entity7 was never questioned despite the fact he was struck off by the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) in @entity3			1
he refused to attend the inquest into his victim and the medical hearings which barred him from ever working in @entity3 again			2
the @entity100 , the equivalent of the @entity96 in the @entity3 , wanted @entity10 struck off			1
but they are powerless to force him to go while he still retains the support of the local authority which licenses him			0
@entity11 's sons dr @entity106 , who lives in @entity107 , @entity108 , and his brother @entity109 , who works as a @entity111 scientist in @entity112 , have been campaigning to get @entity10 struck off in @entity7			1
@entity57 is still battling demands from @entity10 for compensation after he branded him a killer and a charlatan at a plastic surgery conference he was speaking at five years ago			2
now dr @entity25 , 50 , finds himself enmeshed in litigation , with @entity10 seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation			0
it stems from a passage in a book written by him called ' @entity76 ' in 2011 about the effects of immigration on societies in @entity126			0
' part of this , a very small part , was articles taken from the @entity130 and from @entity3 newspapers about the @entity10 case , ' said dr @entity25			2
' it mentioned what he did and the death of dr @entity11			2
it was not racist and never intended to be			0
' it was n't until just recently that myself and my publisher received from @entity10 's lawyers his complaint that the book violates his human rights and that no mention should be made of his name or this incident , or indeed his race , the fact that he is barred from ever working as a doctor in the @entity3 again or the fact that he had ever worked there			1
it was a very small chapter and it was all true			0
i do not know how he can carry on like this considering what he did to mr @entity11			0
' the hearing against him and his publisher is scheduled for may 20			0
he said : ' i am confident that common sense will prevail but you never know what will happen in a courtroom			0
' even if he loses , i am sure he will appeal all the way to the @entity166			0
he thinks he is a supreme medical man who should never be challenged			0
' dr @entity10 has not responded to calls requesting comment .			0
