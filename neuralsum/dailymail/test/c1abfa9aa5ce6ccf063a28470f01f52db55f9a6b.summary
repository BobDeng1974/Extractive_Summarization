apology : @entity4 chief @entity3 whose rogue staff misled the @entity5 a @entity7 bank has been hit with a record £ 21million fine after being caught falsifying documents to avoid compensating victims of mis - selling			1
now there are calls for criminal charges to be brought over an extraordinary cover - up lasting more than two years at @entity4 and @entity17			1
rogue staff misled the financial ombudsman – deliberately obstructing its investigation into payment protection insurance complaints			1
they deleted records and tampered with evidence to make it look like the customer was never sold @entity27 , or they lied about not being able to trace documents			1
politicians called for a police investigation into the wrong - doing , which took place between may 2011 and july 2013			1
@entity34 , a @entity35 former member of the @entity36 , said : ‘ this all took place well after the financial crisis , when banks said they had changed			0
‘ it would be unacceptable if criminal charges are not brought against the people who perpetrated this			0
an example must be set			0
’ @entity46 ’s @entity45 said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud or forgery			1
‘ the police or the @entity52 should look at the evidence , because clearly there is a possibility of fraud or forgery which cheated people out of compensation , ’ he said			2
it is a criminal offence under the @entity60 to falsify documents			0
mr @entity45 added : ‘ this behaviour is reprehensible and shows the lengths some banks have been prepared to go to mislead regulators			2
‘ the police really need to look into this – fines are not enough			0
’ @entity4 and @entity68 @entity17 are part of the same group and owned by @entity71 , with around three million customers and just under 300 branches			2
@entity4 holds the banking licence for both in the @entity76			2
according to the @entity80 watchdog , the worst of the cover - up – which lasted from may 2012 to june 2013 – resulted in up to 42,200 @entity27 complaints being rejected unfairly and up to 50,900 customers receiving inadequate compensation			1
in one case a married couple were cheated out of a £ 5,100 pay - out because the lender lied to the ombudsman that it had not been able to trace records of them having bought @entity27			1
in reality , it never looked for them in the first place			0
the @entity60 said the bank had an ‘ inappropriate policy ’ for its complaints handling in 2011 – instructing staff not to search for @entity27 complaints relating to loans and mortgages that had been repaid more than seven years prior to the complaint			1
@entity4 also failed to trawl back through credit card statements dating before 2000 for customers mis - sold @entity27 alongside a credit card			1
this resulted in some customers being short - changed on compensation pay - outs , or missing out entirely			0
but the wrongdoing escalated in may 2012 when a team of staff started to provide false information to the @entity5 when it was investigating complaints on old @entity27 policies			1
this included deleting any reference to @entity27 on documents related to a customer			2
@entity119 also tampered with computer records to make it look like that documentation had been destroyed			0
this information was then printed out and sent to the @entity5			2
the @entity80 watchdog said management at the bank were not aware this was going on			0
@entity128 , of the @entity129 , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s failings were unacceptable and fell well below the standard the @entity60 expects			2
fined : the @entity60 investigation found ' serious failings ' in the way @entity4 handled its @entity27 complaints ‘ the fact that @entity4 misled the @entity5 by providing false information about the information it held is particularly serious and this is reflected in the size of the fine			1
’ @entity4 and @entity68 ’s failings were so serious that the £ 20.7million fine dwarfs the next biggest penalty handed out for @entity27 , which was £ 7million imposed on @entity145 in 2008			1
the policies were meant to protect customers with loans who lost their jobs or became too sick to work			0
@entity46 's @entity45 said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud or forgery but they were widely sold to customers who would never have been able to claim – including the elderly and those with existing medical conditions			1
high street lenders – which made huge profits from selling @entity162 – have been forced to set aside £ 24billion to compensate customers			0
@entity4 has so far set aside just over £ 800million , of which £ 291million has been paid out – with average settlements of £ 2,900			0
but its bill is set to grow as it is forced to revisit 180,000 old cases			0
the cost of @entity27 mis - selling is expected to spiral as complaints continue to flood in			1
@entity170 has racked up a bill of more than £ 12billion so far – around half the amount put aside by the entire industry			0
the @entity174 continues to be swamped by 4,000 complaints a week , but banks complain that claims management firms – which bombard customers with nuisance text messages and phone calls – are driving many people to make bogus @entity27 complaints			1
@entity4 said it had taken disciplinary action against the staff involved			2
acting chief executive @entity3 said : ‘ we deeply regret any instance which led to the @entity188 receiving incorrect or incomplete information from us			0
‘ these practices were not authorised or condoned by the banks			0
as soon as this issue was discovered , we took immediate steps to stop it ; we made the regulator aware and rapidly introduced strict new monitoring procedures			0

staff at @entity4 and @entity200 misled the @entity5
they obstructed investigation into @entity27 complaints by tampering evidence
politicians called for *enquiry* into wrong - doing between 2011 and 2013
mp @entity45 said those who falsified documents could be guilty of fraud
