the @entity0 on wednesday took the unprecedented step of announcing they are to appeal the decision to hit @entity3 goalkeeper @entity4 with only a one - match ban for betting on matches			1
@entity8 compliance officer @entity7 made the surprise move after deciding the suspension — which included a one - match suspended ban — was ‘ unduly lenient ’			0
and , as the appeal was announced , former @entity8 compliance officer @entity13 called the punishment ‘ light ’ , insisting tough sanctions against footballers who gamble were necessary to help stave off the rising threat of match - fixing			0
however , @entity4 ’s legal team believe the original sentence was fair , given the keeper gambled just £ 202 over a 12 - month period on a total of 55 matches			2
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity4 was handed a one match ban for breaching betting rules the @entity29 ’s modest bets were mainly placed on games played in @entity29 and @entity31			1
he bet only once on a @entity33 match — a @entity35 fixture — and never on games involving his own team			0
the 35 - year - old former @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity41 keeper argued in front of the @entity0 - convened independent judicial panel earlier this month that he believed @entity33 football followed the same rules as the @entity0 down south when he moved north of the border in 2013			1
in @entity29 , players were forbidden from betting on matches involving their own teams and on competitions in which they feature			0
the @entity0 have since updated their rulebook to follow the @entity0 ’s own zero - tolerance approach , which outlaws betting on any professional football game in the world			1
the @entity0 believe the ban handed out by an independent judicial panel is too lenient and will appeal against it the one - match ban handed down on february 12 saw @entity4 sit out of a 2 - 0 home defeat against @entity62 rivals @entity61 at @entity63 24 hours later			1
this is the first time since the right of appeal on judicial panel judgments was introduced at the start of this season that the @entity0 have exercised their option to challenge a verdict			1
the appeal date has yet to be set			0
last night an @entity0 statement read : ‘ the @entity0 can confirm that the compliance officer has appealed against the sanction imposed on @entity4			2
‘ an appellate tribunal will convene in due course to consider the appeal on the basis that the sanction imposed was unduly lenient			0
’ ironically for @entity3 , a key driving force behind the @entity0 pushing to introduce the power of appeal in judicial panel cases was the sentence handed out to @entity63 midfielder @entity85			1
@entity4 gambled just £ 202 over a 12 - month period on a total of 55 matches mostly in @entity29 and @entity31 in september 2013 , @entity85 was banned for 10 games — with seven of those suspended until the end of that season — and fined £ 7,500 after admitting betting on 160 matches over a seven - year period , including , crucially , laying three wagers against his own club winning			2
in another case last year , @entity97 of @entity98 , was last year given a four - game ban — with two suspended — after placing 150 bets , including seven bets on six matches involving his own team			2
last night @entity13 told @entity109 : ‘ taking a tough stance now is the way to stop that ( match - fixing ) coming into the game			0
‘ for @entity4 to miss one match is perhaps light when you consider what else gets you a one - match ban , for example two yellow cards			0

@entity4 was banned for one game for betting on football matches
@entity0 believe the ban handed out by independent judicial panel is ' lenient '
