a tunnel is set to be built under @entity1 to relieve one of @entity4 ’s most traffic - congested roads			0
chancellor @entity5 is expected to commit hundreds of millions of pounds to give the long delayed project the go - ahead			1
it would end years of debate over the infamous bottleneck on the @entity11 , which runs right past the @entity12 in @entity13			2
historic : the world heritage site was recently visited by @entity17 president @entity16 during a @entity19 summit it is expected that the new scheme will be along the lines of earlier plans considered for the site it will also provoke furious opposition from campaigners , who fear a tunnel could damage the hugely important 5,000 - year - old site , visited only last month by @entity17 president @entity16			1
traffic jams on the @entity11 , one of the main routes into the @entity33 , have plagued motorists for decades – prompting a local mp to brand it the ‘ devil ’s highway ’			2
plans to tunnel under the monument were ditched by the last @entity42 in 2007 when the cost of the proposed 1.3 - mile subterranean passage reached £ 540 million			1
however , government insiders last night signalled that mr @entity5 will use his autumn financial statement to commit money to reviving the scheme			1
improving the road to make a real alternative to using the @entity51 and @entity52 would be hugely popular with motorists heading to and from the @entity33 – a key battleground for the conservatives at next year ’s general election			0
@entity57 wants the longest tunnel possible to take as many cars and trucks away from the site chancellor @entity5 is expected to announce the @entity11 upgrade plan in his @entity63 a source stressed that no final decision had yet been made but suggested the move would be part of several major road improvement schemes set to get the go - ahead			1
‘ because we ’ve got a grip on the public finances , we can make investments in important infrastructure all over the country as part of our long - term economic plan , ’ he said			0
the expected go - ahead comes after reports yesterday that the @entity57 was now ready to support the idea of a tunnel up to 1.8 miles long under @entity1			1
it also follows transport secretary @entity84 ’s decision earlier this year to order a feasibility study into improving the @entity11 , including tunnelling under @entity1 or moving a section of the road to the north			1
but sources indicated last night that the tunnel option was the likeliest to proceed			0
three weeks ago , mr @entity84 told the @entity93 conference in @entity94 that he wanted to improve ‘ vital congested roads like the @entity11 ’ soon			2
five other major road projects , including extending sections of dual - carriageway on the @entity99 in @entity100 and improving the @entity101 along the @entity102 , are also under consideration			0
@entity1 , pictured , has been a major bottleneck on the @entity11 providing access to the south west last night , @entity108 mp @entity107 , whose constituency includes @entity1 , welcomed the prospect of an end to the bottleneck			2
but he said : ‘ both the people of @entity13 and anybody who uses the road to go to the @entity33 in the summer need a solution that will be deliverable in a believable time - frame – not a vague aspiration that falls at the first hurdle			0
’ @entity120 , author of the book @entity11 , highway to @entity123 , cast doubt on whether the tunnel would be built			1
he said : ‘ i ’ll believe it when i see it , and i do not expect to see it			0
it is about as likely as @entity130 getting his eye back			0
‘ and if they do build it , it would deprive hard - working , tax - paying motorists of the pleasure of a free view of the most famous prehistoric monument in @entity139			0
’ @entity57 was unavailable for comment .			2
