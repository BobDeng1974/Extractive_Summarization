by @entity0 we 're always being told that white bread is unhealthy and we should stick to wholemeal			1
but new research suggests it could actually be a healthy option			0
a study found it significantly boosts the number of ‘ good ’ microbes in the stomach , warding off disease and leading to better health			2
eating white bread could increase the levels of ' good ' bacteria in the gut , research suggests the finding could mean the much - maligned white loaf regains some of its popularity after being banished to the back of the supermarket shelf			1
in a surprising twist in the white bread story , scientists found it encourages the growth ‘ good ’ gut bacteria			1
the @entity28 study looked at the bacteria in people ’s guts and what role they play in people ’s health			0
this is important because it is known that when certain populations of bacteria drop , we become more prone to disease			1
one of the most effective ways to maintain a good balance of the microbes is to eat well			0
the team , from the @entity45 , investigated the role of polyphenols , common in such items as spices , teas , fruits and vegetables and how they worked to help balance the microbes in people ’s guts			0
if ' good ' bacteria levels fall , people are at increased risk of disease they asked 38 healthy adults questions about their diets and worked out which bacteria were present in their stool samples			0
their analysis revealed that pectin , a compound in citrus fruits , lowers the levels of some helpful bacteria , contrary to previous research			0
but , their most unusual finding was that white bread boosted @entity74 , a group of beneficial bacteria			1
to date , wholegrain foods have been linked to increased ‘ good ’ bacteria levels , because of their high fibre content			0
however , the latest study found consumption of often undervalued refined grains – such as in white bread and white rice – could also boost the level of health - giving microbes			1
study co-author dr @entity88 said : ‘ although the limited sample size and high variability of individuals do not allow firm conclusions to be established , our study highlights the importance of considering diet as a whole , rather than isolated components			0
‘ the identification of an association between the intake of regular foods , such as oranges or white bread , and certain microbial groups emphasises the requirement of future research focused on diet rather than on isolated compounds			1
’ however it has not been all good news for white bread lovers			2
just two weeks ago , a study revealed eating three slices of white bread a day increases the odds of becoming overweight by almost half			2
the @entity117 on @entity118 , in @entity119 , @entity120 , was told wholegrain bread does not lead to weight gain while white bread does			2
the researchers , from the @entity124 , in @entity28 , revealed that people who eat 120g or more of white bread a day are 40 per cent more likely to pile on the pounds than those who eat 60g or less a week .			1

when certain populations of gut bacteria drop , diseases can develop
white bread was found to boost @entity74 , a group of beneficial bacteria
this means it can help fight off disease and ill health , say researchers
