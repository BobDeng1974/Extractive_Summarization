by @entity0 when it was unveiled earlier this month , @entity2 's uniform for the @entity3 was widely ridiculed			1
there was even a petition set up which gained hundreds of signatures calling for it to be replaced			1
but this evening , @entity2 athletes wore the lurid bright blue tartan with pride as they walked round @entity12 stadium in @entity13 during the championship 's opening ceremony			1
the athletes paraded in front of the stadium crowd , which included the @entity20 , in their @entity21 designed outfits which have been described as ' embarrassing ' , ' shocking ' and ' humiliating ' by people on social media			1
but those who signed a petition , started by @entity43 @entity42 on @entity44 calling for it to be ditched , said it made a mockery of the host nation			1
but @entity2 were n't the only country whose kit has been lambasted in the run up to the games			2
the @entity55 outfits designed by @entity56 , from @entity57 , also left a lot to be desired			1
without sparing their peer 's feelings , another fashion designer , @entity59 , said the @entity55 jackets have a ' @entity63 from @entity65 ' look to them and that the jumpers look ' homemade			2
' proud : despite being mocked in the build up to the games , the @entity55 wore their @entity65 style jackets with pride at the opening ceremony @entity73 me up , @entity75 : designer @entity59 has taken a pot shot at the @entity55 jackets saying they look like something @entity63 from @entity65 might wear wrapped up for a @entity80 summer ( do n't tell them we 've had a heat wave ) : @entity55 's @entity3 athletes model the team 's outfit in the run up to the games the @entity55 team were also equipped with woolly scarves to help them keep warm during the @entity80 summer			1
@entity56 told the @entity91 earlier this month that she was n't bothered about the criticism			2
' i do n't want to dwell on the negatives , ' she said			0
' i 've heard it , and you expect it from some people , i 'd rather talk about the positives			0
' @entity56 was the lead designer on the project in a team of five , who constructed the uniforms based on its functionality , comfort and style			0
she said the uniform 's ' brief ' had been stuck too and that the athletes approved			2
they certainly looked proud as they modelled the yellow and green kit this evening			0
perhaps they felt they did n't look so silly after all after seeing the uniforms of some of their fellow competitors from other countries			0
@entity121 : the team from the @entity123 wore flowers in their hair with their floral print frocks feminine : the @entity129 team wore colourful frilled dresses drab trousers : the @entity133 team were full of enthusiasm if not style the @entity2 were n't the only ones in tartan as the team from @entity139 also wore the pattern and the @entity141 wore tartan trousers			1
while some countries like @entity145 stuck to track suits in their nation 's colours , others were more adventurous with their outfits			1
the @entity151 uniform was certainly eye - catching			0
their bright orange garb was accessorised with tiger print - but poignantly , they also wore black arm bands in remembrance of the victims of the recent @entity151 airline disasters			2
the @entity160 were also prepared to shine as night fell on the stadium as they wore high - vis style neon jackets			0
the @entity123 , @entity164 and @entity165 all paid homage to their tropical climates with bright @entity170 style shirts			0
the @entity123 female athletes topped off their looks with colourful flower garlands on their heads			0
sticking with tradition : the team from @entity177 wore their formal attire of woven mats - but this athlete also embraced the host nation by donning a @entity183 shirt surf 's up : @entity164 's squad wore bright shirts more tartan : this time in the @entity139 team outfits neon : the athletes from the @entity160 were brightly dressed ready to board : @entity193 's team looked a little like air hostesses with their red blazers and silk scarves all blacks : the @entity199 kit also kept with tradition on trend : the @entity203 women look good in flattering red dresses @entity205 : the cardigans gave the outfits a more relaxed look like the @entity2 in their kilts , the team from @entity177 chose to reflect their country 's signature style by wearing their traditional formal attire which consists of woven mats			1
meanwhile , the team from @entity216 looked like a an @entity218 team in their baseball style jackets while the team from @entity193 were reminiscent of air hostesses in their red jackets and silk scarves			0
one team who did n't stand out from the crowd was @entity133 , who played it safe in black blazers , red shirts and drab beige trousers			0
the @entity199 athletes also stuck to what they know - wearing black rugby - style shirts			0
the red dress has quickly started to overtake the lbd and so the @entity203 team took the prize for the most on trend style with their flattering red dresses			1
but of course the athletes wo n't be concerned about who tops the table in the style stakes - it 's all about the medals and they will now be battling to do their countries proud in their sporting fields as the championship begins .			2

@entity2 's uniform was *panned* when it was unveiled earlier this month
critics said @entity21 designed bright blue outfits with tartan were ' embarrassing '
petition was set up calling for it to be ditched
@entity55 outfits also *condemned* for lack of style
but athletes wore them with pride at this evening 's opening ceremony
other nation 's failed to win any medals for their fashion choices on display in @entity12
@entity203 were best dressed in flattering red dresses
