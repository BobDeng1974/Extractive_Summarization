our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start without fluent @entity5			1
the highly standardised curriculum continues to present a one - size - fits - all roadblock , preventing teachers from addressing pupils ’ actual needs			1
having been a child who does n’t speak the local language twice – in both a @entity14 and an @entity16 school – as well being as a teacher in an @entity19 primary school where many pupils did not speak @entity5 , i have seen both sides of the coin			1
but when i was teaching a decade ago , children were not given the same level of support , and were often left to muddle along			0
@entity37 , who believes schools have been failing children for years some progress has been made since then , but trying to ‘ press on ’ and not address poor @entity5 is a lose - lose situation for everyone , including native @entity5 speakers			1
the pupils who do n’t receive opportunities to develop their language skills risk going through the education system with a major disadvantage			2
in turn , those who speak @entity5 can end up being neglected in classrooms where teachers are struggling to cope with weak language skills			1
whether you ’re happy or unhappy with immigration levels , it ’s a straightforward reality that many children in this country begin primary school speaking a different mother tongue			0
policymakers ’ failure to properly address this is an extraordinary oversight			0
ignoring @entity5 in schools simply makes no sense			2
for those championing the opportunities of immigrants , a strong command of @entity5 is imperative to making a successful life in this country			2
for those less embracing of multi-culturalism , a common language is crucial to help maintain a sense of unity			0
this country has never been very good at languages			0
but perhaps we could at least improve the command of our own .			0

@entity37 says schools ca *n't* cope with non- @entity5 speakers
adds standardised curriculum prevents addressing pupils ' actual needs
believes we need to improve our command of our own language first
