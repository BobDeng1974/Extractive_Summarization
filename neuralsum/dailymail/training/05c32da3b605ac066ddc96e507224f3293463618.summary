what does two times six equal ? in this case , it ’s a dozen twins - all starting at the same primary school on the same day			2
the remarkable line - up of four - year - olds is likely to require double the concentration for teachers and classmates			0
but yesterday they were looking forward to ensuring they can put the right names to all the new faces			0
they are ( from left ) @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , and @entity33 and @entity34 in a line : @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , and @entity23 and @entity24 @entity25 and @entity26 : first reports said the twins were delighted to find themselves in the company of other twins and were happily getting to know one another all at the same time : @entity29 and @entity30 ( left ) , and @entity27 and @entity28 ( right ) are among the twins starting at @entity18 it will be good practice - because with multiple births on the increase , teachers up and down the country will see more matching pairs of siblings starting school life together			1

‘ we are very lucky to have them all with us , ’ said headteacher @entity52			0
‘ we ’ve never known this many sets of twins to start , but it has n’t been too much of a logistical problem			1
thumbs up : @entity23 and @entity24 ( left ) , and @entity33 and @entity34 ( right )			0
in 2012 there were 11,228 sets of twins born in @entity62 and @entity63 starting school together : @entity31 and @entity32			1
about one in every 64 births in the @entity67 today is twins , triplets or more unusual situation : @entity71 headteacher @entity52 ( pictured ) said the school is ' very lucky to have them all with us ' back to school : the two identical and four non-identical sets of twins are enjoying their first full week at @entity18 in @entity19 ‘ it has been school policy to try to split sets of twins up where possible , and we ’ve managed to do that across the three foundation classes			1

identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one fertilized egg divides			1
all women have approximately the same chance of having identical twins – about one in 350 to 400			1
identical twins do not run in families			1
however , there are some factors that make having non-identical twins more likely : ‘ the whole idea then is that the twins can be mutually exclusive , can branch out on their own and have separate groups of friends			1
’ despite best intentions , there were still a few tears on a nerve - racking first day , and not just for the children			0
@entity105 , mother of @entity33 and @entity34 , said : ‘ they ’re my first to start school , so it ’s been exciting and upsetting all at the same time			0
‘ at one point i was walking up to their classroom door with one gripped around each leg			0
they ’re so close , so one crying just sets the other one off			0
but it ’s lovely that they ’ve got other twins to make friends with			2
’ @entity118 , mother of @entity28 and @entity27 , said : ‘ it ’s just so bizarre , is n’t it ? ' i never thought there would be this many sets of twins starting at the same time			2
' my two are used to being unique , and now they ’re two in a crowd			0
it ’s lovely to see though			0
’ first reports said the twins were delighted to find themselves in the company of other twins and were happily getting to know one another			0
dressed in matching green uniforms , they were also helping to remind class teachers who was who			0

@entity151 , director of the @entity152 , based at @entity154 ’s @entity153 , said : ‘ in recent years and because of infertility treatments , the number of twins born has been rising			1
’ she supported the policy adopted by many schools to try to separate twins if possible			2
‘ each twin relationship should be looked at to see what suits the children best but being in separate classes can bring huge benefits , ’ she said			2
