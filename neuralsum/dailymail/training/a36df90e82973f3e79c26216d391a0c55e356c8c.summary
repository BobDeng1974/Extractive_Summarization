by @entity0 technology that could one day power your smartphone using just body heat has been developed			1
wearable computers or devices have been hailed as the next generation of mobile electronic gadgets , but finding a way to deliver sufficient , long - lasting power has been a problem			2
now scientists have come up with a novel solution using a glass and fabric - based thermoelectric generator that could spell a new age of discreet smart technology			1
a team of researchers at @entity20 in @entity21 headed by @entity22 of electrical engineering have proposed a novel solution to creating wearable technology by developing a glass fabric - based thermoelectric generator ( pictured )			1
the device converts body and can charge mobile phones a team of researchers at @entity20 ( @entity33 ) in @entity21 headed by @entity22 of electrical engineering are behind the innovation			1
@entity37 designer @entity36 demonstrated wearable technology at this year 's @entity39 in @entity40			2
the @entity41 is a ' onesie ' made of copper woven within layers of cotton thread			0
these wires can be connected to chips including @entity48 , @entity49 and gps batteries and processors are hidden inside built - in pockets on the onesie			0
@entity36 is now working with tech firms to develop the product further			0
but there are no immediate plans to launch the garments commercially			0
professor @entity60 with his team created a flexible thermoelectric ( @entity64 ) generator that allows you to recharge electronic devices from your own body heat			2
the device is suitable for recharging heart monitors , smartglasses and other wearable technology , experts claim			1
a thermoelectric generator is a device that can convert heat , or a temperature difference , into electric energy			1
using the small but significant temperature difference between skin and air , professor @entity22 and his team have been able to produce this tiny and wearable thermoelectric generator			1
for electronics to be worn by a user , they must be light , flexible , and equipped with a power source , which could be a portable , long - lasting battery or a generator			2
@entity20 's generator is extremely light and flexible and produces electricity from the heat of the human body			2
professor @entity22 confirmed that the generator could also charge smartphones			0
' right now we are trying to make a sample that provides electricity for medical sensors , ' he says			0
' after that , smartphones will be next application of the @entity64 generator			0
' it is so flexible that it can be bent almost in a complete circle , and there are no changes in performance even if the generator bends upward and downward for up to 120 cycles			0
wearable computers or devices have been hailed as the next generation of mobile electronic gadgets , from smart watches to smart glasses to smart pacemakers			1
professor @entity22 's device ( pictured ) is suitable for recharging heart monitors , smartglasses and other wearable technology the glass fabric - based thermoelectric generator is so flexible that it can be bent almost in a complete circle with a gap of just 20 millimetres ( 0.8 inches ) , and there are no changes in performance even if the generator bends upward and downward for up to 120 cycles to date , two types of @entity64 generators have been developed			1
these are based either on organic or inorganic materials , the former being carbon - based compounds found in biological systems and the latter molecules lacking carbon found in geological systems			2
the benefit of organic - based te generators is they are highly flexible and compatible with human skin , ideal for wearable electronics , but they have a low power output			1
inorganic - based te generators produce a high electrical energy , but they are heavy , rigid , and bulky			1
professor @entity22 came up with the new concept and design technique to build a flexible @entity64 generator that minimises thermal energy loss but maximises power output , combining the benefits of both organic and inorganic materials			0
when using the generator for a wearable wristband device , it will produce around 40 milliwatts of electric power based on the temperature difference of 0.5 ° @entity158 ) between human skin and the surrounding air			1
for now it is intended to be suitable for charging small devices like mobile phones ' this is quite a revolutionary approach to design a generator			0
in so doing , we were able to significantly reduce the weight of our generator , which is an essential element for wearable electronics , ' he says			0
when using @entity20 's te generator for a wearable wristband device , it will produce around 40 milliwatts of electric power based on the temperature difference of 0.5 ° @entity158 ) between human skin and the surrounding air			1
professor @entity22 further described the merits of the new generator			0
' our technology presents an easy and simple way of fabricating an extremely flexible , light , and high - performance te generator			0
' we expect that this technology will find further applications in scale - up systems such as automobiles , factories , aircrafts and vessels where we see abundant thermal energy being wasted			0

a team of @entity21 researchers have devised a fabric - based generator
device produces power *due* to temperature difference between skin and air
to date wearable technology has struggled because generators are too big
but this innovation could make smart glasses and more a *reality*
it is small enough to be worn on your body and charge a mobile phone
