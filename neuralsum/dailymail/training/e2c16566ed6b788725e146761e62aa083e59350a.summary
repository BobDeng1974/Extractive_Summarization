@entity1 insurgents in @entity2 are bribing starving children as young as eight years old to plant deadly roadside booby traps , be decoys in ambushes and even act as suicide bombers			1
despite the @entity11 fundamentalists ’ claim they have no children in their ranks , extremists have been actively recruiting orphaned and homeless young boys and training them to use guns , improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) and suicide vests			1

’ in the immediate aftermath of the raid , @entity32 was kidnapped by @entity1 leaders and taken to a nearby town and shown how to use guns and make ieds			1
they plied him with sweets and he was initially delighted when they said they planned to bring him an extra-special gift – a suicide vest packed with bullets and grenades			1
‘ they made me try it on			0
the grenades went all around my body and then they offered me the coins [ 50 @entity71 – about 60p ] , ’ he said			0

other children are less fortunate			1

film - maker @entity110 said : ‘ thousands of children are being recruited and taught to make bombs or become suicide bombers			1
it is common for 13 - year - olds to carry guns			1
less than ten per cent of the population is educated so these children do n’t have their own minds , they only have what the mullahs are telling them in the mosques			1
’ @entity110 was given unprecedented access to a £ 500,000 @entity123 - built prison in @entity101 , where the cells each hold 20 boys			2
@entity126 , @entity127 , was 12 when he joined the @entity1 following his father ’s death in a @entity131 air strike			0

’ @entity110 added : ‘ i felt incredibly sad listening to @entity127 and others			0
they are already dangerous men			0
when they leave prison they will be recruited for other campaigns			0
’ most @entity2 do not know their date of birth and the @entity1 – whose code of conduct allows any male with facial hair to become a fighter – use the uncertainty to insist they do n’t use children to fight			2
@entity110 said : ‘ many believe there will be civil war and it wo n’t just be the @entity1 recruiting children – all groups will target them			1
they are the fighters of the future and that is a problem not just for @entity2 but for the world			0
