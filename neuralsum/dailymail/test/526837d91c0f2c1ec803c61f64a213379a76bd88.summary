in a sport so often dominated by egos , the idiom ‘ if he was chocolate , he ’d eat himself ’ could be used on a weekly basis in boxing			0
and going by the sobriquet ‘ @entity9 ’ , you might expect @entity10 to have an appetite to match his ring alias			1
instead , the man who will stand in the opposite corner to @entity16 ’s @entity15 next weekend comes across as anything but the egotist			1
@entity10 ( left ) may be nicknamed ' @entity9 ' but he shows none of the expected arrogance at times , the 31 - year - old ’s verbal patter buzzes with a modesty and philosophical slant which often betrays the expectations of a hard - hitting middleweight , carrying a 71 per - cent knockout rate in his undefeated record			1
only once during the course of an exclusive interview with @entity31 does @entity10 speak with a hint of bite to match the aggression that saw him put @entity35 on the canvas six times en route to his 2012 world - title win			1
this comes when he is questioned about the criticism he received after opting to vacate his @entity43 world championship last year			2
while @entity15 is the defending champion next weekend , @entity10 , the challenger , is also the former title holder having never lost the belt in the ring			1
the 31 - year - old had been due to defend against undefeated @entity48 @entity47 but turned down a career - best $ 1.4million pay day when deciding not to fight the mandatory challenger			2
@entity15 later stepped in to defeat the @entity48 ( for a much lower purse ) , leaving @entity10 to face accusations of ‘ ducking ’ his obligations as champion			1
only recently did @entity10 reveal that he took a sabbatical to deal with the conflicting emotions of welcoming his first child into the world , while seeing his uncle unsuccessfully battle cancer			1
‘ i learned a lot of patience through that , so i could n’t care less what people ’ s opinions are or what they ’re about			0
nobody gets paid to care ! , ’ blasted @entity10 about the flak he faced for giving up his belt			1
‘ it ’s about being challenged , you ’ll be challenged for all different decisions that you make – [ decisions ] that i made in my life and i think that applies to anybody else			0
the @entity77 has a 71 per cent knockout ratio , but he is keeping his feet on the ground ahead of the fight ‘ i just worry about myself , keep good thoughts and a positive mind and keep a great mindset for myself and that i ’m just focused			1
’ @entity10 ’s first son , @entity85 , was born last august , at the same time his close uncle , @entity86 , battled pancreatic cancer , losing his fight just two months ago			1
he has been out of the ring for 12 months since his last title defence			1
has he been able to shake the ring rust and the emotional baggage ? ‘ everything is a challenge in life			2
i was always in the gym , but i was dealing with mental stuff and i ’m glad i overcame those things			0
‘ now i ’m back to where i need to be at , ’ answered @entity10			1
‘ testament to that is when i step into the ring with @entity15 on april 11			1
i challenge myself to overcome these things			0
‘ my uncle ’s in his casket and gone now so i got a closing period , a one on one with my uncle before he passed			0
‘ i left him in @entity106 ( @entity107 ) on february 2 and he passed three days after			0
it was like a rough thing , but i had my closing period where i accepted that the fate of @entity112 is going to be what it is and i did n’t have no control over that			0
i just learned some powerful things – that i need to accomplish as much as i can while i ’m living so that i do n’t have regrets when it ’s my time			0
‘ now i ’m just looking forward and @entity15 is who ’s in front of me right now			1
’ moving on seems to be a regular feature of @entity10 ’s life			1
next week ’s fight with @entity15 will take place in the challenger ’s adopted home town , but to call @entity10 one of ‘ @entity128 ’ is to ignore his path			1
born in @entity130 , but raised in @entity106 , only his ‘ @entity9 ’ nickname hints at his pedigree			0
@entity10 , who will fight @entity15 next week , says it will be a big test against the @entity135 fighter he was christened with the alias owing to his physical resemblance to the legendary @entity139 featherweight champion of the same ring name , but @entity10 also has a blood connection to the @entity143 island as his father was born there before defecting to the @entity77			1
‘ i went there in 2009 and spent two - and - a - half weeks there and it was one of the best times			0
i got to learn about life and experience , something different other than what i ’m used to , ’ says @entity10 on his pilgrimage to @entity139			1
‘ living in the @entity77 all your life , you go out to another country and you assume you know everything until you see other people living a certain way			2
‘ i had to recheck myself and say i ’m not somebody that knows everything … i found out that it ’s not really about the money , it ’s about your family			0
‘ my father left @entity139 and met my mom in @entity130 – my mom ’s an @entity172 black lady			0
my mom spoke nothing but @entity175 and my dad spoke nothing but @entity178 , but my dad learned @entity180 from my mom and my mom learned @entity178 from my father			0
‘ my father knew the original @entity9 in @entity139 , but he ’s no relation			0
it ’s part of my destiny that i was named @entity9 by other people			0
@entity10 has been away from the ring for a while , but is now ready to recapture his title against @entity15 ‘ i knew i had a big responsibility when it came to taking on the name			1
it ’s a great part of my story to inherit a name like that and fight for the legacy of a fellow @entity139			0
’ undefeated in 31 fights with 22 knockouts , @entity10 is doing his best to uphold that honour but critics have suggested that he has not always taken on the best opponent available			2
he has defeated some big names , including an old @entity204 , while his stoppage wins over tough contenders were impressive and his title win over @entity208 ( @entity15 ’s opponent at the @entity210 ) proved his world - class ability			1
but @entity15 is arguably his most testing opponent to date			2
@entity10 is reluctant to compare their respective levels of opposition , however			2
‘ @entity15 is just going to be one of those tests for me to go out and challenge [ myself ]			2
‘ for me to criticise other people ’s performances , that ’s not what i came in the game for , i came in the game to be a fighter and worry about fighting			0
‘ i gave @entity15 nothing but respect for accomplishing what a lot of people did n’t get to do , which is become a champion so i look at him like a champion and a guy that has never took a loss			2
‘ you got to realise that @entity15 is who he is now and @entity15 today might be different from the @entity15 that was [ around ] yesterday or in the future , you never know			2
‘ we just prepare and train hard to make sure we ’re able to learn [ about ] people right there in that ring and focus on that			0
‘ you just have to accept sometimes that people try to be great like other people and never become great , but if you ’re able to take what you already have and work with those things you become great			0
’ his words read as a tasty recipe to become a champion .			0
