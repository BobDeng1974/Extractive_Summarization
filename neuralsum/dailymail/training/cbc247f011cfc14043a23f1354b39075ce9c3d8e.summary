when i was in @entity1 recently talking to victims of sex abuse , i heard a terrifying story			1
if it is to be believed — and after the events of this week it seems increasingly credible — it speaks volumes about how corruption and cover - up in the town reached right to the heart of the council			1
i was told that a girl in her late teens was at home one evening when the door - bell rang			2
it was in the run - up to the local elections last year , and people were canvassing for votes			0
she opened the door of her family ’s house — and found herself staring into the face of a man she recognised			0
he had been part of a gang who had sexually abused her time and again when she was a child , between the ages of 12 and 14			0
she screamed with horror , slammed the door and ran upstairs , leaving him on the step			0
‘ i thought he had come to find me and that the rapes would start all over again , ’ she later told her friends			0
this girl , and hundreds of others like her , were not believed or listened to when they related accounts of sex abuse to authorities in the town at the centre of one of @entity60 ’s biggest - ever child exploitation scandals			1
now , with every passing month , the stench of a cover - up grows stronger			0
files from an independent youth group which counselled the victims — because no one else in officialdom seemed to care — were taken away by @entity69 staff , then they mysteriously disappeared and the organisation was shut down			0
in another incident , a council worker writing a report for the @entity73 on how to stop grooming gangs in the area had her documents stolen from a locked office			1
even today , 17 years after the start of the shameful scandal which led to so many girls being abducted , beaten , threatened and forced to witness other rapes , a new report says that @entity69 and many of its employees remain in denial over the abuse			1
@entity87 ( pictured ) was asked to inspect @entity69 after the child abuse scandal emerged last year and said it is ' not fit for purpose ' yet the truth , however , uncomfortable , is irrefut - able			1
when i took an early victim of the sex abuse gangs into @entity1 town centre one night last year , she was able within a few minutes to point out by name men who had systematically raped her as a 13 - year - old schoolgirl			1
they were free , on the streets , driving their flashy cars around , and — as the girl told me — almost certainly still picking up young girls to abuse			1
the young woman herself is now a counsellor to abused girls			2
she claimed she knew some young mothers in @entity1 who have five illegitimate children apiece			1
they are the product of rapes by the gang members who groomed , attacked and pimped them with total impunity			0
‘ these children are going to school now			0
everyone knows where they came from , ’ she told me			0
‘ as for their abused mothers , they will have thought that gang rape was just a normal part of growing up here			0
’ i first warned in the @entity123 five years ago of young girls being traded in provincial towns as sex slaves			1
i was accused by social workers , police , councillors and even faith organisations of making it up			1
in fact , i had learned the truth from parents who rang or emailed me in desperation , saying that no one was heeding their warnings			0
later , i heard it from the girls themselves			2
yet when i wrote about the scandal , i was branded racist			0
the reason ? i dared mention the truth : that most of the victims were white or of mixed race , while all too often the perpetrators were of @entity60 - @entity148 heritage			0
@entity149 came in a major report last year by professor @entity151 , who confirmed that the greatest number of abusers were from this community			2
of course the vast , decent majority of @entity156 must , surely , be as disgusted as the rest of us at the abuse			2
but this racial element remains an uncomfortable aspect of these obnoxious crimes , which was confirmed again yesterday			2
and so we reach the crux of the problem			0
i believe the crimes were not tackled — and , indeed , were covered up in @entity1 — because the racial make - up of the sex gangs made the whole issue taboo for politically correct politicians , social workers and police			1
in modern @entity60 — so ultra-sensitive on matters of race — the authorities were terrified of being accused of racism if they targeted the culprits			2
@entity69 ( pictured ) faces new elections and new management after the latest damning report over the town 's child abuse scandal time and again , the authorities which should have been protecting the girls blamed them for being out of control , wilful youngsters who consented to sex with men old enough , in some cases , to be their fathers in exchange for a ‘ good time ’ — alcohol , free food and a ride around in a flash car			1
lies were leaked to the media : that the girls were from dysfunctional families , had been put into care to protect them , and could not be persuaded by social workers or police to stop their wild sexual behaviour			1
this was far from the reality			0
virtually all of the victims of child grooming i ’ve interviewed — whether it be in @entity1 , @entity213 , @entity214 or @entity215 , all places where these predators have operated — are from caring families			1
it has taken nearly two decades for the truth to emerge , but only now are we discovering the chilling extent of the abuse , and the level of cover - up .			2

@entity225 warned of girls being traded as sex slaves in provincial towns
said she was accused by social workers , police and councillors of lying
