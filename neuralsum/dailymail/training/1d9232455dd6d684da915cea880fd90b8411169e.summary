by @entity0 the @entity1 is considering a bold move to label perks like free lunch given to workers by companies as taxable			1
the agency wonders if freebies like haircuts and gym memberships are a way to compensate the highly skilled rather than just a way to jumpstart productivity			2
companies say it would be a step too far that needlessly chips away most notably at the fruitfulness of industries in @entity18 that have become a driving force behind the @entity21 economy			1
free lunch ? the @entity1 is debating whether or not it should tax the free lunches given out to workers at firms like @entity26 and @entity27 as a form of compensation ' i clearly think it ought to be taxable income , ' @entity32 tax law professor @entity31 , @entity30 told the @entity36			1
after all , argue proponents of such a tax , workers at @entity18 firms like @entity27 and @entity26 receive free meals from famously fancy in - house eateries every day			1
some companies even go a step further by offering freebies like haircuts , car services , and child care			2
typical workaday folks can expect to pay for all these using their fully taxed wages , an argument at the heart of the agency 's reason for pondering the added tax			0
' i buy my lunch with after - tax dollars , ' @entity31 told the @entity36			0
' and i have to pay taxes to support free meals for those @entity27 employees			0
' @entity27 reportedly serves 50,000 meals per day in its 120 cafes worlwide			0
on the flip side , and in addition to arguments that the tax agency is already hopelessly burdened , are complanies ' claims that the perks are n't perks at all : they 're incentives			0
in the eye of the law , free meals are permissable , for instance , if they are ' noncompensatory ' and a ' convenience to the employer			0
' perk or incentive ? @entity27 doles out an estimated 50,000 meals per day at its 120 cafes worldwide			0
firms with freebie policies tend to consider them a means of incentivizing their workers rather than a perk ' there are real benefits for knowledge workers in having unplanned , face to face interaction , ' tax law prof from the @entity87 @entity86 told the @entity36			2
in @entity18 , where collaboration is the key to innovation , employers say they facilitate by putting workers lunch rooms where the munch free gourmet food			1
it 's also an environment where the less time employees are away from their desks , the more time they 're working on projects that benefit the company			0
and according to at least one @entity18 tech start - up founder , those projects benefit @entity21 as a whole			2
' our customers win [ because ] they get a higher quality product and then our shareholders win because they see our momentum in the market , ' @entity108 of ceo of @entity110 , a cloud computing company , told @entity118			0
' if the @entity1 wanted to stop the productivity of @entity18 and of the economic growth engine that this place is , ' he said , ' then they can have at it			1
' as the government grapples with whether or not they should tax the recipients for their free meals -- or whether it 's even got the manpower to add the task to its ever - growing list of to - dos -- @entity18 companies already know how they 'll respond			1
legal experts largely agree that tech companies eager to keep programmers and the like well - fed and hacking away will probably just report the meals as taxable income and pay workers more to make up the difference .			1

the huge move would largely affect @entity18 firms where workers are *accustomed* to freebies like lunch
the @entity1 wonders if these perks are compensation but companies argue it 's an incentive to work harder
