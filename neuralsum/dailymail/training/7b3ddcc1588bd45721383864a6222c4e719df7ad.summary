the @entity1 @entity0 today ruled that a police officer in @entity3 lawfully stopped a car with a faulty brake light - and then found a stash of cocaine in the vehicle - even though driving with one working light is not illegal in the state			1
in an 8 - 1 decision , the court ruled against @entity13 , who had argued that the sandwich bag of cocaine found in the april 2009 search should not have been allowed as evidence when he was charged with drug trafficking because the @entity20 sergeant had no valid reason to stop the car			1
@entity13 , who consented to the search of the car after he was stopped , pleaded guilty and was given a maximum prison term of two years			1
the officer pulled over the vehicle for a faulty brake light and found the cocaine ( library imaged used ) chief justice @entity31 wrote on behalf of the court that the officer 's mistake in believing that it was illegal to drive with one working light was not sufficient to violate @entity13 's right to be protected from an unlawful search under the @entity1 @entity38 's @entity37			1
under court precedent , a vehicle stop is valid only if the officer has ' reasonable suspicion ' that the driver broke a law			2
the court concluded in the @entity3 case that ' reasonable mistakes of law ' like those made by the officer in question do not make a search invalid			2
@entity31 rejected the argument made by @entity13 's lawyers that such a ruling would dissuade police officers from learning the law			0
he wrote that an officer ' can gain no @entity37 advantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is duty - bound to enforce			0
' justice @entity61 was the sole dissenter , writing that the court was ' further eroding the @entity37 's protection of civil liberties in a context where that protection has already been worn down			0
' she said lower courts will have difficulties assessing in future cases when an officer 's mistake was reasonable .			0

a police officer in @entity3 stopped a car with a faulty brake light , which is not illegal in the state , but found a stash of cocaine
@entity13 argued that the stash of cocaine should not be used as evidence because the officer had no valid reason to stop the car
