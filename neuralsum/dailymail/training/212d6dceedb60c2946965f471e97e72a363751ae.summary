by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 19 november 2013 @entity2 : 06:42 est , 20 november 2013 proposals : new parents would get up to 15 months leave between them and be able to switch time off with little notice under @entity8 plans plans to allow new parents to ‘ chop and change ’ time off work in the first year of their child ’s life are in turmoil after a bitter coalition row			1
to the anger of senior conservatives , who argue businesses can not be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy comes out of recession , their @entity8 partners have proposed a dramatic extension of @entity27 plans for shared parental leave			2
according to one senior @entity30 source , @entity8 want to extend the maximum time off after the birth of a baby to 15 months and allow parents to repeatedly switch periods of leave between them			1
business secretary @entity38 and equalities minister @entity39 are at odds with @entity30 colleagues over plans that couples must be allowed to switch leave up to at least half a dozen times , so that one has a spell at home , the other at work , before swapping over time and again			1
they also suggest that new parents should be guaranteed a return to the same job however long their period of leave			1
currently , employers can offer an equivalent post after six months			2
the proposals are understood to have prompted a major row inside the coalition , with conservative ministers , including @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 objecting so strongly that they have now been shelved			1
deputy prime minister @entity66 , who has condemned existing rules meaning new fathers only get two weeks off work as ‘ @entity70 ’ , was on the point of announcing the extended parental leave package , drawn up by @entity73			1
the coalition has agreed that new fathers should be able to take up to six months of paid leave from work			1
the @entity77 will give them the right to ‘ mix and match ’ childcare arrangements in the first year of their baby ’s life from april 2015			0
employed mothers will still be entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave			2
however , working parents will have much greater flexibility about how they ‘ mix and match ’ their leave			1
they may take it in turns or take it together , providing it is not more than 52 weeks in total			0
outrage : ministers @entity65 , left , and @entity64 , right , were said to be very strongly against the plans mothers will have to take at least the initial two weeks of leave after birth as a recovery period , but can then choose to end the maternity leave and parents can opt to share the remaining leave			1
legislation to revolutionise the workplace by introducing flexible parental leave prompted dismay from some business leaders , who have said it will be a ‘ nightmare ’ to administer			0
the government insists employees will have to give employers proper notice of their intention to take leave , to allow businesses to plan for absences			1
employees must tell employers at least 15 weeks before the week a baby is expected when they want their leave to start , though they can change this with 28 days ’ notice			1
controversial : the dramatic extension of the government 's plans were drawn up by @entity39 , pictured , equalities minister however , according to one well - placed source , @entity8 ministers attempted to change the agreed package of reforms so that couples could ‘ chop and change ’ shared parental leave with less notice			1
the @entity8 say firms only need eight weeks ’ notice of an employee ’s intention to return , while the @entity140 say it should be at least 12 weeks			0
the @entity8 also are said to have suggested that the total leave period should be increased to 65 weeks and that employers lose the right to offer employees who return after more than six months an equivalent post , not necessarily the same one			2
‘ the government has agreed a package of reforms with business and then all this extra stuff was all slipped in by the @entity8 , even though a lot of it had n’t even been consulted on , ’ said the source			0
‘ it was actually about to be announced by @entity66			0
how on earth would the typical small business with three or four employees contend with staff mixing and matching time off with a week ’s notice ? ’ shared parental leave is designed to smash the traditional assumption that it is the mother who should take time off work to care for a new child			0
ministers say the measures will offer more flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to be the main breadwinner and allow fathers to spend more time with their children			2
the issue caused a @entity179 rift with some ministers having argued that pledges to extend parental leave and flexible working rights at a time of economic difficulty			1
under existing rules , mothers are entitled to take 12 months maternity leave , of which nine months are paid			2
fathers can take two weeks paid paternity leave			2
slammed : deputy prime minister @entity66 has condemned existing rules of two weeks paternity leave as @entity193 in the past the deputy prime minister said recently fathers should be able to do more of the ‘ heavy lifting ’ if mothers want to return to work after having a child			1
‘ we are revolutionising parental leave so it is not paternity leave anymore , it becomes parental leave , ’ mr @entity66 said			0
‘ you and your wife or partner will be able to chop and change , and exchange the block of leave that presently is afforded to the mother through maternity leave , as you wish			0
‘ i know plenty of women who feel that they want to go back to work earlier than their partners or their husbands do , that ’s just the way families are , obviously that ’s great			0
‘ but we ’ve got these @entity70 rules - i ’ve experienced it myself three times			0
it ’s crazy that when your child is born you ’ve got just a couple of weeks , when in a sense you ’re least relevant to the child , because they ’re barely aware that you ’re there			0
’ miss @entity73 wrote on @entity228 that shared parental leave is ‘ a fantastic , much - needed policy ’			0
she insisted that @entity30 claims the @entity8 had proposed a leave period as long as 65 weeks were ‘ just wrong ’ .			0

parents would get up to 15 months of leave between them in plan
idea drawn up by equalities minister @entity39 caused rift in coalition
conservative ministers objected so strongly it has now been shelved
coalition agreed new fathers should be able to take up to six months off
