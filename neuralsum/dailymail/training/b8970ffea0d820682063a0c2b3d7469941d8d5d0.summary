by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 16:44 est , 19 august 2013 the man who was attacked by a polar bear last month in a @entity4 national park , is back home in @entity6 and set to undergo jaw surgery today			1
@entity8 flew into @entity9 last tuesday after spending three weeks recovering at a @entity11 hospital from a polar bear attack at his camp in @entity14 on july 24			1
thanks to the quick actions of his camping group , he miraculously survived and is back at his home in @entity19 , @entity6			1
miracle : the lawyer mauled by a polar bear last month in @entity4 returned to the @entity23 last week and was pictured at his home in @entity19 , @entity6 saturday back home : @entity8 , pictured with his wife @entity25 , is set to have jaw surgery today after being attacked by a polar bear july 24 @entity8 , a lawyer for @entity28 , was attacked during a @entity30 guided tour of the @entity31 in the far @entity32			1
@entity8 's primary fear before going on the trip was that he would n't be physically fit enough			1
he trained all winter to make sure he would be able to cover the terrain			0
polar bears are rampant in the park during the summer months when the melted ice confines them to land			2
but @entity8 was unconcerned about the polar bears			1
plus his group had an electrified fence used to surround the camp at night and keep the bears out			1
he even saw a few on the trip before the attack			0
one morning they witnessed a mother out with her baby cub			0
' my god , they are cute , like a little stuffed animal , ' @entity8 told the @entity55			2
' then we had another big boy that came in and sat and watched us for a bit			0
we had to fire a flare at him to chase him off			0
' @entity61 beautiful : @entity8 was mauled while on a guided tour of the @entity31 led by the @entity30 but somehow the fence failed because a bear slipped through on july 24 while the rest of the camp was sleeping			1
@entity8 was awake and saw the bear through his one - person tent			1
he yelled ' @entity68 in the camp ! @entity68 in the camp ! ' before the beast latched onto his neck and would n't let go			1
contrary to early reports by his wife that he fought back , @entity8 says he did no such thing			2
his body went limp and he gave in			0
' i thought i was dead , ' he said			0
' i could hear the bones crunching back in my head where he was chewing on me			0
i could see the bear ’s legs			0
i was kind of under this belly with big white legs — no doubt what it was			0
i remember thinking to myself , it ’s got ta happen to everyone			0
' and then he saw the light			0
his group shot off flares at the bear as he was dragging @entity8 down to the beach and the beast lost it 's grip			1
@entity8 believes it must have been a younger bear since an older one probably would n't have dropped him			1
before : @entity8 , a lawyer at @entity28 , pictured before the attack his group carried @entity8 back to the camp and performed what first - aid they could while they waited for emergency responders to arrive			1
it was a long wait			0
they were unable to communicate with the @entity106 's telecommunications center until 6:30 a.m. the next morning			0
seven hours after the attack a helicopter arrived take @entity8 and a doctor form the group to a base in @entity112 that had a trauma clinic			1
they were later transferred by fixed - wing aircraft to @entity116 for further treatment			0
the rest of the group was left with an @entity119 - the only people allowed to carry guns in the park			2
while @entity8 suffered severe injuries to his back and head , it could have been a lot worse since the bear 's bite did n't cause any spinal chord damage			1
' if he had bitten any other way , i think i would have been dead , ' @entity8 said			2
' either i would have had a stroke or been paralyzed			0
but now , here i am , sitting in @entity19			2
' lucky : the polar bear 's grip surprisingly did n't damage @entity8 's spinal chord , which could have had debilitating effects @entity8 's wife @entity25 is glad her husband is home safe and sound			1
@entity25 was informed of the attack the afternoon after it happened and flew into @entity11 to be by her husband as he recovered			2
‘ the @entity4 did an amazing job of getting him transported			0
there was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start , ' she said			0
@entity151 locked : polar bears became more populated in the park during the summer when they are confined to land due to the melting of ice a spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005			2
' there are high densities of bears in the park and you are at very high risk of encountering a bear			2
that said , this is the only incident we have had of this seriousness since the park was established , ' said @entity174 , manager of resource conservation for @entity176 in @entity177 and @entity178			0
@entity14 is a 3,700 - square - mile @entity179 located on the @entity32 in @entity177 and is home to seal - hunting polar bears , caribou and remnant glaciers			1
@entity8 is expected to make a full recovery .			1
