claiming : @entity0 , 31 , pays a reported £ 100 a week rent to a private landlord for her three - bedroom terraced home in @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 reacted with outrage last night after an immigrant mother of ten who receives £ 34,000 a year in benefits demanded that the council gives her a larger home			1
@entity14 @entity0 , 31 , arrived in @entity15 with three of her children in 2008 and moved into a council - maintained three - bedroom house			1
four years later , however , the single mother says she is unhappy living there – because she has had three more children and four others have moved over from @entity14			1
‘ i have ten children living here with me , ’ she said			1
‘ i ’m the only adult			0
i am on the council waiting list , but we ’re still here			0
‘ they do n’t have a big enough house			0
i want a bigger house			0
i do n’t like it here			0
when we moved in it had bed bugs			0
’ her neighbours are fuming			0
they say up to 18 people lived in the terraced home at one point , creating mess outside			1
one claimed the property was , essentially , a ‘ halfway house ’ for @entity14 when they first arrive in the country			2
another neighbour , @entity43 , 39 , said : ‘ this kind of thing is beyond belief			0
if they want a bigger house they should have to earn it like everybody else			0
‘ it is not for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for a bigger house			0
’ but the council appears to be supporting her , with one councillor saying he is ‘ sympathetic ’ to her demands			0
miss @entity0 , a self - employed cleaner , pays only £ 100 in rent a week to a private landlord for the house in @entity5 , @entity6			1
the property is maintained for her by @entity5 borough council			1
she claims working tax credits , child tax credits and child benefits			2
every week , she receives £ 527 in child tax credit and working tax credit as well as £ 127 in child benefits			1
in total , she receives £ 34,000 a year from the state – far more than the average @entity15 salary of just over £ 26,000 before tax			1
the amount is also much higher than the £ 9.26 per child she would receive each month if she were still living in @entity14			1
there , couples can claim up to £ 1,865 per baby , but payments dip after children reach 18 months			2
home : nearby workmen said they are frequently called to the privately - rented three bedroom house in @entity5 ( pictured ) to fix damage caused by the children			1
they said they constantly slam windows and break hinges miss @entity0 claimed she has ‘ no choice but to move ’ from the house because her children are crammed inside , with some having to sleep on mattresses in the living room			1
‘ i came to @entity95 to live – because we are from @entity14 , which is in the @entity97 , i could just come , ’ she said			0
miss @entity0 added that she was concerned the council ‘ may be angry now and make me go back to @entity14 ’			2
up keep : the backyard of the three bedroom house has cracked paving and furniture sacked outside ' i came to @entity95 to live – because we are from @entity14 , which is in the @entity97 , i could just come ' @entity0 she lives in the house with @entity106 , 16 , @entity107 , 13 , @entity108 , 12 , @entity109 , 11 , @entity110 , ten , @entity111 , eight , @entity112 , seven , @entity113 , four , and twins @entity114 and @entity116 , three			1
the three youngest children were born in @entity15 and the others have joined her from @entity14 over the last four years			1
miss @entity0 will not reveal how many men fathered her children			1
one of her neighbours , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ there have been up to 18 people living there			2
‘ there have also been complaints about the rubbish which has been put outside the property			2
the council know about it			0
plea to move : writing on the wall of the rented home			2
ms @entity0 says she 's the only adult living in the house and she does n't like the home as when she moved in it had bed bugs general street view : ms @entity0 privately rents the house and all the maintenance is carried out by the landlord			1
a general view of the road is pictured			0
the average income for a @entity15 taxpayer in 2008 was £ 24,769 ‘ it is almost like it is a halfway house for people arriving from @entity14 , who then move on			1
’ a builder , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ i often do jobs on the house			0
' i am sympathetic to her needs			0
i am also sympathetic to the needs of ten children			2
it is not ideal that they are living in overcrowded accommodation ' @entity161 , @entity5 council ‘ the kids are everywhere			1
there is nothing wrong with the house			0
there was nothing wrong with it when she moved in , anyway			0
’ but @entity161 , the councillor in charge of housing at @entity5 council , said : ‘ i am sympathetic to her needs			2
‘ i am also sympathetic to the needs of ten children			0
it is not ideal that they are living in overcrowded accommodation			0
‘ on the other hand providing accommodation for a mother with ten children is a fairly big ask in most areas , let alone @entity5 where that is n’t readily available			1

she earns £ *10,000* a year more than the average @entity15 worker in benefits
