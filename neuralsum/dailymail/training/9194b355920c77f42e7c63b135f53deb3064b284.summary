by @entity0 @entity1 continued their preparation for their return to the @entity4 with a 2 - 2 draw at @entity6			0
the @entity1 looked on course to record a 2 - 1 victory at the home of fellow @entity10 side @entity6 , after goals from @entity12 and @entity13 put them in front following @entity15 's early opener			1
but a @entity17 strike six minutes from time denied a @entity20 side without @entity22 victory at the @entity23			1
back of the net : @entity13 gave @entity1 a 2 - 1 lead with a curling free - kick two minutes into the second half heads i win : @entity6 's @entity15 ( centre ) scores with his head the opening goal past @entity1 ' @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 looking on : ex-orient chairman @entity36 ( second left ) and @entity1 manager @entity20 ( second right ) watch the game from the @entity23 stands @entity6 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity15 , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 46 ) , @entity17 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 67 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49			1

goals : @entity12 19 , @entity13 47 attendance : 2,996 @entity22 was just one of many admissions from the @entity1 team , but @entity20 still fielded a fairly strong side with @entity78 , @entity13 and new arrival @entity34 all handed starts			1
and it was the former @entity82 defender who was caught napping early on as he was beaten to a right wing cross by @entity15 who powerfully headed the @entity87 side into a 10th minute lead			1
it was a deserved lead for the @entity90 but @entity1 soon hit back nine minutes through @entity12			0
the winger took one touch to set himself before firing an effort into the bottom left - hand corner with a 20 yard effort			0
@entity13 saw an effort deflected over shortly after but soon turned the game on its head for the @entity1 , with a sweetly struck free - kick two minutes after the break			2
the @entity1 looked like they would hold on for a second pre-season win of the season but @entity17 found space before slotting home with his left foot from just inside the box with just six minutes to play			0
despite the late strike , a draw was just reward for @entity6 who matched @entity1 throughout the game even forcing @entity58 into a smart double stop just before the hour mark			0
embrace : @entity13 is congratulated by @entity63 after netting his side 's second goal new faces : new signing @entity34 featured in the @entity1 defence but @entity22 was not in the squad heads up : @entity6 's @entity119 and @entity1 's @entity63 challenge for the ball down on the touchline : @entity20 moved to watch the game from behind the bench as the match unfolded			1

hoops held to draw at @entity23 after @entity17 strikes late for @entity87 side
@entity13 and @entity12 had helped turn game around following @entity15 's opener
@entity22 left out of @entity20 's squad for all - @entity10 *clash*
