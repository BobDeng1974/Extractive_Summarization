by @entity0 published : 22:31 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 03:32 est , 3 december 2013 @entity1 was last night accused of backsliding from his pledge to wean @entity3 off its reliance on union funding by delaying reform for five years			1
the @entity3 leader had previously vowed to overhaul party funding to give union members more rights to opt out of funding @entity3 through the political levy			1
he made the promise in the wake of the @entity15 candidate selection scandal , which laid bare @entity3 ’s reliance on the union @entity17			1
@entity1 was last night accused of backsliding from his pledge to wean @entity3 off its reliance on union funding by delaying reform for five years but it has now emerged that mr @entity1 only wants to give that option to new union members and to enact the changes over five years			1
the move is seen by critics as an attempt to appease @entity3 ’s union paymasters , whose funding accounts for around £ 8 out of every £ 10 raised since mr @entity1 became leader in 2010			1
it is also seen as a ploy for the cash - strapped party not to lose its main revenue stream			0
in july , mr @entity1 vowed to reform funding , saying : ‘ you have my word that this reform will be thorough , wholesale and lasting			1
’ last night @entity41 , chairman of the @entity42 , said : ‘ in the summer , @entity1 promised to take on @entity43 ’s @entity17 by reforming the @entity3 ’s link with the unions			2
‘ but now we learn that @entity1 is buckling under pressure from his union paymasters and watering down his reform proposals			1
‘ once again , @entity1 has shown he ’s too weak to stand up to the union barons fixing his own party ’s selections			2
and if he ’s too weak to stand up to @entity43 , @entity1 ’s too weak to stand up for hard - working people			2
’ mr @entity1 is now locked in talks with the unions and @entity56 , former general secretary of the party , according to the @entity58			2
@entity17 ’s executive will meet next week to decide whether to back the reform , which mr @entity1 said is designed to mend , not end , the party ’s union link			2
unions fear their voting rights at the @entity3 conference and in leadership elections could be slashed if they sever the funding link			0
he made the promise in the wake of the @entity15 candidate selection scandal , which laid bare @entity3 's reliance on the union @entity17			1
( general secretary @entity43 pictured ) @entity73 , chairman of the @entity75 and eastern region of @entity17 , said : ‘ our executive has got to keep a collective voice and that collective voice has to be expressed through the block vote at a decision - making party conference where unions keep 50 per cent of the vote			0
that is the main point			0
‘ if unions stand together , with half the votes at @entity3 ’s conference , and supported by many constituency parties worried about the severe threat to the party ’s finances from @entity1 ’s proposals , as well as the negative impact on the left within the party , then the link can be successfully defended			0
‘ the changes that were proposed were not thought through and they are both bad for the unions and bad for the party			0
’ @entity41 , @entity96 criticised the move			0
