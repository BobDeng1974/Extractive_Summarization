a mystery investor or hedge fund reportedly made a bet of almost $ 1billion at odds of 10/1 last month that the @entity4 would lose its aaa credit rating			1
now questions are being asked of whether the trader had inside information before placing the $ 850million bet in the futures market , or if the bet happened at all			1
there were mounting rumours that investor @entity14 , 80 , famously known as ‘ the man who broke the @entity17 ’ , could be involved			2
was it him ? @entity14 , 80 , has been mentioned as potentially being the mystery investor who won a $ 1billion bet that the credit rating would fall he made more than $ 1billion on currency speculation when the @entity26 pound left the @entity27 on black wednesday in 1992			1
but a source with knowledge of the firm said @entity14 was not involved in the rumoured trade and questioned whether in fact there had been such a trade at all			1
the latest bet was made on july 21 on trades of 5,370 ten - year @entity38 futures and 3,100 @entity38 bond futures , reported etf @entity40			2
now the investor 's gamble seems to have paid off after @entity43 ’s issued a credit rating downgrade from @entity45 to aa + last friday			0
whoever it is stands to earn a 1,000 per cent return on their money , with the expectation that interest rates will be going up after the downgrade			0
concerned traders : @entity55 opened down on monday after @entity43 's issued a credit rating downgrade from @entity45 to @entity57 + last friday the link has been made to mr @entity14 in part because he has been tied to president @entity61 ’s administration since 2008 , reported @entity62			0
he also recently stopped managing money for outside investors , meaning he is under less scrutiny from the @entity67 and @entity66 but the mystery bet could easily have been made by another trader with similar resources , despite mr @entity14 ’s links with the @entity61 administration			1
the bet also raises questions of whether president @entity61 and treasury secretary @entity75 knew that a downgrade was on the cards			0
mr @entity75 said in april there was ‘ no risk ’ of a downgrade - but the government now appears annoyed , not surprised , by last week ’s decision			0
he has since slammed @entity43 for showing ' terrible judgment ' in their decision and a ' stunning lack of knowledge ' of @entity4 fiscal budget maths .			0
