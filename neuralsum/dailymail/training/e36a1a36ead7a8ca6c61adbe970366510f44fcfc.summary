a vast new hostel for @entity2 migrants hoping to sneak into @entity3 is to be opened in @entity4 as temperatures are expected to plummet			1
the ' cold weather emergency centre ' in a 40,000sq ft warehouse fitted with beds and hot showers will be opened when temperatures fall below -5 centigrade			1
it will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the northern @entity14 port			2
that centre was used as a stepping stone to @entity3 by an estimated 18,000 refugees during its six years of operation			1
@entity4 prefect @entity33 said the centre , two miles from the town 's ferry port , would be available for use within the ' coming days '			1
he said : ' the cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall			2
' we need a space that can house around 1,500 people , that they can reach on foot , but one that is not in the town centre , because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in @entity4			2
' a separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women , children and elderly migrants will also be opened			1
the @entity3 government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to come to @entity4 hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to @entity62			1
the centre will become the first large - scale shelter for @entity4 migrants since the @entity28 @entity27 hostel was bulldozed in 2002 ; it was used as a stepping stone to @entity3 by an estimated 18,000 refugees the @entity3 government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to come to @entity4 hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to @entity62 but mr @entity33 insisted the shelters were ' humanitarian gestures ' , adding : ' neither of these centres are in any way new @entity28 - type hostels in @entity4			1
' tensions have been mounting in the town in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the @entity81 and poverty in @entity83 flood across @entity84			2
mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during july and august			0
in october , home secretary @entity88 promised to give @entity14 Â£ 12million to tighten security in @entity4 after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the @entity93			0
the @entity3 also offered @entity4 an 11 - mile long high security fence used at a @entity96 summit in @entity97 to keep the migrants out of the terminal			0
@entity4 mayor @entity100 recently blamed the @entity3 's ' generous ' state benefits for their influx of refugees			0
she said : ' @entity4 is a hostage to the @entity3			0
the migrants come here to get to @entity3			0
' the situation here is barely manageable			0
the @entity3 border should be moved from @entity4 to the @entity110 side of the @entity93 because we 're not here to do their jobs			0

the hotel is 40,000sq ft and will feature beds and hot showers
and comes as a day centre offering hot food and showers is to open
the hostels are being *compared* to the @entity28 @entity27 hostel
