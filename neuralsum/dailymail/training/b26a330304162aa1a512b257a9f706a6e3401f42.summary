by @entity0 this set of pictures shows the incredible interaction between alligators and a group of sanctuary daredevils who swim , wrestle and hand feed the reptiles underwater			1
massive alligators are not only wild in the state of @entity13 but are also considered to be a nuisance - meaning they can be legally killed			1
but the kind - hearted and fearless staff at the @entity17 in the town of @entity19 have taken in all the nuisance alligators they can , averaging around 200 a year			1
to make money to feed the huge beasts the staff put on daily shows , where they wrestle and hand feed the animals in front of a paying crowd			1
during the shows the reptiles are wrestled and hand fed staff such as mr @entity32 capture alligators reported as a nuisance before they are legally killed , saving the animal and then attempting to re-home it photographer 's assistant @entity45 also felt safe enough to take a swim , pictured here getting up close with a gator and even rubbing the reptile 's throat wildlife photographer @entity51 , 41 had never before swum with an alligator when he took the plunge and jumped into the 50ft pool			1
' the guys at the farm invited me down to take some pictures of them with the gators and said i could get in with them and keep all the pictures i liked			2
' for the first ten or 15 minutes i had to acclimatise myself with them but then i figured they did n't want to hurt me so i felt much more comfortable			0
' i would swim towards them and they would swim away			0
gators only eat once a week and depending on the time of day			2
they can be quite placid animals			0
' they know what is and is not food but they are in no regard tame - you can not tame a gator			0
' mr @entity32 posing for a picture with one of his adopted gators - which can grow to be bigger than 3 metres in length depending on their age and sex photographer @entity51 said he had never swum with an alligator prior to the photo shoot , but he had dived with sharks for many years and understood wild animals staff member @entity85 , left , pictured with @entity45 , undertakes the hair raising wrestling routine daily for paying crowds at the @entity13 sanctuary @entity32 and @entity85 work at the farm and attempt to re-home each and every alligator in a neighbouring farm or sanctuary - as nuisance gators can never be released back into the wild			1
they invited mr @entity51 , who lives in @entity98 , @entity13 , to the farm to photograph their up - close and personal encounters with the large reptiles			2
' it was a really fun day but you ca n't forget these people do some fantastic work , ' he said			0
' if a gator shows up at somebody 's house or at a bbq or anywhere else in the state of @entity13 more than a couple of times then the state will deem it a nuisance			1
' there are around 7,000 nuisance alligators reported each year and legally people can then just go out and kill that animal			1
' @entity119 and @entity85 will then try to rescue it by hand to avoid hurting it			2
' it 's a completely non-profit organisation - they do it all just to save the animals			0
' photographer @entity51 said he had to spend the first 10 or 15 minutes in the water acclimatising himself to swimming in the presence of the alligators staff member and alligator wrestler @entity32 is pictured holding two alligators at once as a less brave looking @entity45 watches on from a distance he added : ' they allowed us to swim with the animals but that 's not normal at the farm			1
i have dived with sharks for many years so i understand wild animals and it was a great experience			0
' my girlfriend was also very comfortable - i think it 's just about how you handle gators and you 've got to be calm			0
' they do n't just attack , they need to be hungry or agitated			0
' it was a great experience			0
