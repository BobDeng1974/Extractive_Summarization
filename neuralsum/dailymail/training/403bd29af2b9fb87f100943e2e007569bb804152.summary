concerns : @entity2 director @entity1 has warned of travelling crooks who exploit cheap flights and visa - free travel to commit crime abroad travelling criminals are exploiting cheap flights and visa - free travel to launch ' burglary blitzes ' in foreign countries including the @entity10 , says @entity12 's top policeman			1
organised criminals are flying in crooks from eastern @entity12 for short - term crime sprees , then shipping them out before they can be tracked by police , said the chief of @entity2			1
the growth of such gangs is now raising questions about the ability of @entity10 police to cope with international organised crime			1
one in seven people arrested last year in @entity25 and @entity26 was a foreign national			0
@entity1 , the director of @entity2 , the @entity29 crime agency , told i : ' in the past , 95 per cent of housebreakers were committed within half - a - mile			2
' now you 're having @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 gangs and others from across @entity12 jumping on airlines , knocking off [ homes and businesses ] , and almost getting out of the country the next day			1
' we have some criminal groups we 've identified in @entity12 that are operating literally in every @entity29 country over a one - or two - year programme			1
' last year it was revealed that police from @entity12 were being drafted in by their @entity10 counterparts in a crackdown on the growing number of foreign criminals			1
for the first time officers from @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity35 were working alongside @entity10 colleagues and targeting known convicts from their home countries			0
but since then the tactics used by international gangs have only got more sophisticated			2
the i cited senior police who said foreign crooks were increasingly working with domestic criminals to plan crimes and launder the profits			1
and those criminals who are caught before they are able to flee the country are increasingly being allowed to stay , according to a report earlier this month that found hundreds are escaping deportation			2
@entity70 , the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration , gave the report to the home secretary in the summer but it was only published at the beginning of this month			0
the report looked at a major new scheme known as @entity75 , which involves immigration officials working in police stations to run checks on suspects ’ immigration status and criminal history			0
it concluded that despite significant improvements in some areas , many foreign offenders were still being released by police without checking they were allowed to be in the country			2
@entity88 border control : organised criminals are flying in crooks from eastern @entity12 for short - term crime sprees , then shipping them out before they can be tracked by police , said mr @entity1 the scheme has had a ‘ positive impact ’ after it was introduced in @entity96 in october 2012 , the report said			1
the number of immigration offenders deported from the capital has risen by 158 per cent from 418 in 2011 - 12 to 1,077 in 2013 - 14			0
but 336 of 717 foreign nationals detained by @entity102 – the other force in the scheme ’s trial – were released before their immigration status was checked			0
the force also only saw a small rise in the number of foreign criminals that were removed – from 239 in 2012 - 13 to 274 last year			0
and some suspects held by the @entity112 were freed because staff shortages meant there were no immigration officers available to run the checks .			0

crooks from eastern @entity12 are being flown in for short - term crime sprees
they are then shipped out of the country before police can track them
domestic gangs are helping to plan the crimes and launder the profits
