it is one of those magical moments a footballer seldom gets the chance to experience ... a return to the place he once called home			0
and for @entity13 , a man maligned by many , @entity10 's @entity9 fourth round trip to @entity12 provided an opportunity to prove himself at the highest level once more			1
at 37 years of age , it is something @entity13 himself admitted he never thought would happen			1
at the end of last season , he was plying his trade at @entity26 @entity25 side @entity24 , meandering towards the end of his career			0
but the big man had one last stint left in him			0
he wanted a move back to @entity32 , to play out his remaining season or two on home turf			0
@entity10 gave him that opportunity , and alongside @entity36 - himself 36 - he was tasked with leading the line in the @entity9			1
@entity13 ( right ) was involved in a battle with @entity40 ( centre ) and @entity12 's back three @entity13 ( right ) worked hard up front for 55 minutes , and was given a standing ovation when he left the pitch @entity13 's heat map shows that he sat on the @entity12 back line to hold the ball up for @entity36 it is a cup competition that @entity13 holds in high regard			1
in fact , he won it with @entity12 in 2001			1
poetic that he should return to @entity50 in perhaps his last season participating in it			1
his reaction from the crowd pre-match was marvellous - and fully deserved			0
@entity50 loves a returning hero , and four successful years at @entity12 have earned him respect on @entity58			1
in truth , @entity13 's first - half contribution was minimal			2
he sat on @entity12 's back line , a relatively imposing three of @entity40 , @entity62 and @entity63 , waiting for his moment			2
it would be unfair to expect a world - beating performance ; those days are gone			0
@entity10 were always going to be on the back - foot , playing on the break after stifling a @entity12 attack , and that proved to be the case			1
his heat map shows exactly what you 'd expect			0
a dark patch in the middle of @entity12 's half			2
and his aerial stats , too			0
10 contests with a defender , six won			0
on the floor , he had 11 duels , and won seven of those			0
he did n't set the game alight , but he provided a presence for @entity90 's side			1
strength and power , attempting to hold the ball up for @entity36 in behind him			0
@entity13 has fond memories of his time at @entity12 , and is loved by the @entity50 faithful the former @entity12 man 's overriding memory of the @entity9 will be winning it with @entity12 in 2001 @entity13 will remember his return to @entity12 , and the reaction he received , for the rest of his life it was the same in @entity12 's treble - winning season in 2001 ; @entity13 teeing them up , and @entity106 firing them home			1
as for @entity13 firing one home himself , it was n't to be			2
there will have been millions watching from their sofas at home , wanting , waiting , wishing for the @entity115 man to put one past @entity116			0
alas , his number was up after 56 minutes , @entity90 revealing after the game that @entity13 had felt a slight tweak in his hamstring			2
if more proof was needed of his status on the red half of @entity12 , the whole stadium were on their feet			2
a standing ovation for the man who evokes proud memories for the @entity50 faithful			1
memories of an @entity9 , @entity133 and @entity134 treble - winning campaign			1
memories of 60 goals in a @entity12 shirt			2
memories of that partnership with @entity106			0
there was no magical moment on saturday night			1
but it was n't necessarily about that			0
it was a moment for @entity13 to savour , and one that he deserves after a 21 - year career			0
that long round of applause as he left the @entity50 pitch for perhaps the last time as a player is something that will stay with @entity13 for the rest of his life .			1

@entity13 spent four years at @entity12 between 2000 and 2004
he won the treble in 2001 ; the @entity9 , @entity133 and @entity134
saturday night saw him return to @entity50 , playing up front for @entity10
he did not set the game alight , but was a big presence for the *visitors*
@entity13 received a standing ovation when he was *substituted*
