by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 24 october 2013 @entity2 have taken over the internet , entertaining millions with their short and often amusing animations			0
but the viral picture format has , up until now , been trapped in digital form			0
now a project is planning to liberate the @entity8 from the internet using a technology invented in the 1940s			0
lenticular film , which shows pitted , prismatic plastic pictures , used to be popular in childhood stickers and notebooks			2
the image in lenticular film appears to move as the viewer moves , with its animation looping through a short number of frames			1
the technology dates back to @entity22 and , like a @entity8 , has its format constraints			0
source : gifpop ! for instance , a lenticular image can only store about 10 frames , while a @entity8 has to be small enough to download easily			0
this got the designers thinking that the two formats may be able to share common works of art. @entity15 and @entity16 launched their @entity46 campaign for @entity18 ! with the aim of making this a reality			1
the project was almost immediately funded			2
as well as the custom gifs , the designers hope to be running off limited batches of works by three @entity8 artists , including mr @entity56 , 89 - a , and @entity57			0
the @entity58 reports that the two designers were inspired to develop the company after seeing @entity61 , another card - based @entity46 campaign			1
they envision a @entity61 - style game played with @entity8 cards			2
' one card would say , ‘ ” my face when i see my ex with her new boyfriend , ” and then players would put reaction @entity8 cards down , ’ said @entity15			0
@entity18 ! still has 25 days of its @entity46 campaign to go and plans to ship its first custom cards in november			1
a pledge of $ 12 ( £ 7.40 ) will get one business or postcard size @entity8 of your choice			1
the company also plans to use @entity82 and @entity83 , in addition to @entity2 , to create the lenticular cards .			1

@entity14 - based @entity18 ! plans to print @entity87 onto lenticular cards
lenticular cards are plastic , pitted pictures that move as the viewer moves
their @entity46 campaign was almost immediately funded and will allow anyone to get a @entity8 of their choice printed for £ 7.40
