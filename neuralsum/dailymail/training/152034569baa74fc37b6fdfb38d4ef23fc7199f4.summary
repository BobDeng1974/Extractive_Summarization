by @entity0 a spectacular country estate designed by @entity2 , @entity3 's ' greatest gardener ' , has come on the market for £ 5.75million			1
but if the new owner wants a stately home to match the grandeur of the huge parkland , they will have to build it themselves , as the last one was demolished after the grounds fell into disrepair			1
@entity14 , near @entity15 , @entity16 , dates back to the @entity17 and a magnificent mansion was built there in 1545			1
the @entity14 estate , near @entity15 , @entity16 , has gone up for sale for nearly £ 6million but has no stately home due to the mansion being demolished after the @entity23 @entity24 was built in the 16th century before its owners brought in famous gardener @entity2 to design the grounds in the late 18th century but @entity24 fell into a state of neglect and after the @entity23 , when @entity3 was virtually bankrupt , it was demolished due to a lack of money to repair it			1
the footings and foundations remain today and planning experts believe obtaining permission to build a new hall in its place would be a formality			0
it could cost an extra three million pounds to build but the value of the whole estate would then be worth more than 10 million pounds			1
the parkland was landscaped by @entity2 in the 1760s			0
he remodelled the estate , most notably turning a small stream into a 44 acre lake and planting clumps of oak trees			1
@entity24 is one of about 170 parklands design by @entity2 in @entity3			0
it has been owned by @entity51 and @entity52 for the last 40 years			0
the couple converted a large stable block on the grounds into a six - bedroom cottage where they live today			1
the estate includes a six - bedroom cottage which was built by converting the park 's stables , but sellers say getting permission to build a larger mansion should be easy the estate , pictured in 1907 , comes with 100,000sq ft of agricultural buildings , 142 acres of arable farmland and 77 acres of woodland @entity2 , real name @entity70 , got his nickname from his habit of telling prospective clients that their grounds had ' great capabilities '			1
before his time , gardens were formal exercises in geometry ; walled in , topiaried , criss - crossed by straight paths , everything intended to show man ’s control of nature			2
@entity2 abolished walls and introduced curved paths and flowerbeds			0
the word at the time was ' landscape ' , the idea that country houses were part of the landscape and you should see no boundary between the grounds and the surrounding countryside			2
nearing retirement , the @entity99 are selling the estate that comes with the cottage , boat house and a @entity105 listed folly that can easily be lived in			1
it has 100,000sq ft of agricultural buildings which are currently hired out for storage , 142 acres of arable farmland , 173 acres of grassland and 77 acres of woodland			2
despite the huge size of the estate - the equivalent of 814 football pitches - the agents selling it claim it is ' perfectly manageable '			1
@entity119 , of estate agents @entity120 , said : ' the vendors maintain the estate themselves using tractors and mowers			1
they are n't daunted by looking after 460 acres , it is perfectly manageable			0
' from a farming point of view , it is n't very big			0
it is predominantly parkland and it is n't that labour intensive			0
' @entity24 began life as a medieval deer park in 1211 when the @entity136 of @entity15 had a hunting lodge there			2
the imposing hall was built in the 16th century before the estate was bought by sir @entity140 , the then lord chief justice , in the 1702			1
it was his great - nephew who had the estate redesigned by @entity2 70 years later			1
it remained in the @entity140 family until 1971 when the @entity99 bought it			0
mr @entity119 said : ' the @entity99 spent the majority of their time looking after it and making changes			0
' there is quite an extensive range of agricultural buildings that form a business for storing agricultural produce			2
' the resurrection of @entity24 is perhaps the only project not undertaken by the current owners			2
' the hall was requisitioned during the war and was used to billet @entity3 and @entity162 military personnel			0
the gardens became a wilderness			0
' after the war the then owner decided to demolish the hall to raise money to plough into the estate			1
the contents were sold and the house itself was taken down brick by brick			2
the footings are still there			0
' our planning department has carried out an assessment of the site and concluded it may be possible , subject to planning consent , to reinstate the hall			0
' the opportunity to buy a @entity2 property just does n't happen very often			0
' it is estimated that it would cost an extra three million pounds to build a new mansion on the site but a new property would boost the value of the estate the parkland was landscaped by @entity2 in the 1760s			1
he remodelled the estate , turning a small stream into a lake and planting a number of oak trees			0

estate in @entity16 whose grounds were *re-modelled* by the famous 18th century gardener goes on the market
despite containing a six - bedroom cottage and numerous farm buildings , @entity14 has no stately home
the mansion which once stood on the site was demolished brick - by - brick to raise money after the @entity23
estate agents say the park would be a unique buy for potential owners , who could *rebuild* the mansion if they wanted
