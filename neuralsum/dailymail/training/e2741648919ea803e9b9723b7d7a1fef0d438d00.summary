by @entity0 for @entity1 it sounds like a textbook millionaire 's bolthole - four bedrooms , two bathrooms and a mooring on the @entity7			1
but this £ 1.8million manor comes with something even the most imaginative buyer could only dream of - a prison made of stones from @entity13			1
former @entity15 journalist @entity14 bought the long - forgotten fragment when he and his wife @entity17 built their mock - @entity18 in @entity20 , @entity21 , from scratch in 2002			1
millionaire 's bolthole : the mock @entity18 in @entity20 , @entity21 , was built from scratch in 2002 by former @entity15 journalist @entity14 and his wife @entity17			1
it has a garden feature for the man who has everything - an imitation prison made from the original stones which were used to build the 19th century @entity13 another brick in the wall : the stones at the bottom of the garden look innocuous - but they are from the 19th century @entity13 and comprise a mock prison no bridge needed : if the owner can make it beyond the bridge - jail , lying in wait is a private mooring on the @entity7 with enough room for two boats mr @entity14 was fascinated by the history of the site , which had formerly housed a sprawling manor which came with its own title			1
the @entity51 had to provide a jail so mr @entity14 did just that , building it out of the stone fragments which had been removed from the @entity57 bridge when it was widened more than 100 years ago			1
the 19th century @entity13 was designed by @entity59 and opened in 1831 , replacing its 600 - year - old @entity61 predecessor which had become crammed with traffic			2
it was the latest in a long history of @entity7 crossings dating back to @entity66 but had to be expanded in 1896 , to accommodate the heaving crowds for the @entity68 of @entity70 @entity69 the next year			2
it is then that it is thought the stone fragment was removed and taken to a field near what is now @entity76 , where it lay forgotten for several decades until it was reportedly rediscovered by the engineer and inventor sir @entity80			1
heaving : a view of the 19th century @entity13 before it was dismantled and reassembled piece - by - piece in the @entity84 desert - with the @entity21 chunk missing sprawling : the luxurious house was custom - built just over a decade ago by its most recent owners , former @entity15 journalist @entity14 and his wife @entity17 throne : sitting on the site of a former estate , the mock @entity91 home brings with it the rather grandiose title of @entity51 and the need to have a private jail the @entity97 was eventually dismantled in 1967 and reassembled stone - by - stone in @entity99 , @entity84 , after the oil tycoon @entity100 bought the remains for $ 2.46million			1
but the millionaire had little idea that a piece of his bridge , which still stands today , had been left behind			2
now 77 , mr @entity14 and his wife spent many years running a floating antiques shop on their barge on the @entity7 before finally deciding to sell @entity18 this year			1
the mock @entity91 property is on the market for £ 1.8million and is set in around three acres with its own 130ft - long private mooring on the @entity7 with room for two boats			1
@entity114 , sales director at @entity115 , said : ' it is not a large house , but it is lovely property			0
it would suit a couple and there is a mooring ' @entity124 and new : although the house features the remains of @entity13 , most of it is considerably more modern with a number of outbuildings large : it also has two reception rooms , one of which has a bay window and double doors looking out on the @entity7 , along with a conservatory and several outbuildings it also has two reception rooms , one of which has a bay window and double doors looking out on the @entity7 , along with a conservatory and several outbuildings , including a stable			1
@entity114 , sales director at the @entity20 office of @entity115 , said : ' the home was on the land of a large manor home which was split up			2
whoever buys it gets the title of @entity51			0
' one of the historic jobs for the @entity51 was to provide a jail			0
so the developer built a mock jail in the garden using parts of the old @entity160			2
' it is not a large house , but it is lovely property			0
it would suit a couple and there is a mooring so it is ideal for a boat person			0
' unlikely attraction : the bridge took three years to ship to the @entity173 and reassemble along with a traditional ' @entity175 ' village , with open - air shops and a hedge maze it was an unlikely fate for a piece of @entity182 engineering - dismantled stone by @entity184 stone and painstakingly reassembled across a lake in the middle of the @entity84 desert			0
but that is exactly what the tycoon @entity100 did in 1968 when he bought the bridge for $ 2.46million , around £ 10.2million in today 's money , in an enthusiastic bid to turn the barren @entity99 into a tourist attraction			0
popular legend tells that @entity100 thought he was buying the far more famous @entity196 , but the rumour was always furiously denied			0
argument aside , his wacky idea was generally seen as a success			0
the bridge took three years to ship to the @entity173 and reassemble , and with it he built a traditional ' @entity175 ' village which featured open - air shops and a hedge maze			2
the bridge still stands today , and the area around it has seen hefty modern redevelopment			0
tourist strip : a more recent view of the bridge , which still stands today			0
its original stonework was built around a new , stronger concrete structure			0

@entity216 in @entity20 , @entity21 , has four bedrooms and a 130ft private mooring on the @entity7
but it has an *unusual* feature - a mock jail with stones from the @entity57 arch @entity13 , demolished in 1967
the stones were removed from the bridge when it was widened in 1896 but left for decades in a field near @entity76
fragment bought by former @entity15 journalist @entity14 and wife @entity17 , who built their mock @entity91 manor in 2002
