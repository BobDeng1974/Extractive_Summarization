by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 11:45 est , 2 december 2013 crisis : a shortage of hospital beds and surgeons are to blame for the high number of cancelled operations , new figures reveal around 170 @entity10 operations are cancelled every day at the last minute as hospitals struggle to cope with a lack of beds , staff and faulty equipment , new figures reveal			1
a total of 30,415 elective operations were shelved between april and september this year on the day patients were due to have surgery or scheduled to arrive in hospital - a 12 - year high			1
experts blame a chronic shortage of beds with @entity10 trusts unable to juggle planned operations and run overstretched @entity28 departments			2
meanwhile other factors blamed for the high cancellation rate include administrative errors , earlier operations over-running , and emergency surgeries taking priority			2
the average daily rate of cancellations is 169 - higher than the average daily rate for the same period in any year since 2001			1
the average daily cancellation figure for april - september last year was 151 and the year before that 142			1
one in five hospitals has bed occupancy rates of more than 95 per cent and a handful of trusts are running at full capacity - leaving them unable to cope with swelling emergency admissions			1
news of the cancellations comes as @entity10 medical director sir @entity48 claimed a two - tier @entity28 should be created to ease pressure on ' an emergency service at its limit '			2
@entity52 , of pressure group @entity53 , said : ' vast number of hospitals have no capacity to take in a mix of emergency and elective cases			0
' ' emergencies will always take priority so if you fill your hospitals up with emergency cases then elective cases are going to be bounced back			0
' these numbers show that hospitals ca n’t cope with the combined caseload			0
' the six - month figure , released by @entity70 , is the highest it has been since 2001 when the number of cancelled elective operations , also revealed in @entity10 figures , topped 41,000			1
but mr @entity52 warned : ' the squeeze is going to continue to tighten as @entity28 caseloads continue to be high and , in some cases , running at winter - peak levels right throughout the year			2
' last month a @entity79 survey found that bed occupancy rates averaged nearly 90 per cent across @entity10 trusts in @entity70			1
they found that a fifth of all trusts reported rates of more than 95 per cent between january and march 2013			0
the number of elective operations being cancelled is at the highest level for years ( stock photo ) bar chart illustrating the number of cancelled operations in @entity70 's @entity10 hospitals in april - september each year the worst performing health trusts for cancelled operations between april - september this year included @entity94 in @entity95 , the @entity96 , and @entity97			1
financially troubled @entity98 in east @entity95 cancelled 649 elective operations between january and june , the most in @entity70			1
its chief executive @entity100 previously said the trust - which covers @entity94 and the @entity102 - was at risk of ' financial failure ' amid reports it was losing £ 2 million a week			0
the @entity96 , meanwhile , cancelled 441 elective surgeries and @entity97 called off a further 296 operations			2
both were labelled in ‘ highest risk ’ category for failing patients by the @entity112 in october			0
@entity94 in east @entity95 falls under @entity98 , one of the worst for cancellations the term ‘ last minute ’ is used by the @entity10 to describe cancellations on the same day surgery is scheduled or operations axed after a patient has arrived in hospital			0
as well as a chronic lack of beds , the @entity10 said operations were shelved because of staff shortages , faulty equipment , administrative errors and earlier scheduled operations over-running			1
the number of cancellations is usually higher in the winter , as numbers of @entity28 admissions rise further			1
an @entity70 spokesman said : ' @entity70 believes that cancellations should be avoided wherever possible as we recognise the concerns that patients face when this happens			0
' hospitals strive to use their beds as efficiently as possible , and at the same time need to respond to surges in demand when these occur			0
' such surges are usually due to an increase in the number of emergency admissions , and whilst health communities endeavour to plan for this , an above - expected rise in emergencies can lead to cancelled operations			2
' this is not directly related to the performance of @entity155 , but to the need to admit patients with sudden and severe illness and injury			0
' the spokesman added : ' an important aim of sir @entity48 's first stage review of urgent and emergency care is to reduce hospital admissions , where these can be safely avoided , and alleviate some of the pressure on hospital beds			0
' therefore , as the recommendations of the review are implemented over the next three to five years the chance that an operation will be cancelled at short notice , which is already very low , should reduce still further			0

total 30,415 elective operations cancelled between april - september 2013
the daily average cancellation figure is highest since same period in 2001
@entity70 blames lack of beds , staff , and faulty equipment for high rate
high bed occupancy means hospitals struggle to fit in @entity28 admissions
