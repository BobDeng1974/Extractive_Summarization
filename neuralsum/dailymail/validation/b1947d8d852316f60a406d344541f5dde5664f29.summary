a striking set of twins , who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed - race parentage , have revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers			1
appearing on @entity7 's @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity9 , both 18 , said classmates at school thought they were telling fibs when they revealed they were twins			1
@entity8 and @entity9 's mother @entity13 is half @entity14 and their father @entity15 is white , and in a genetic quirk , together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin			1
@entity8 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) @entity9 , both 18 , have faced questions from curious strangers throughout their lives over their radically different looks			1
@entity8 even uploaded a photo of her birth certificate to @entity25 the twins say it is n't just their looks that are different , they have individual personalities too			1
@entity8 ( far left ) says she 's much more shy than her sister @entity9 ( second left ) , despite being born 23 seconds before her speaking to @entity31 and @entity32 , the twins , from @entity34 , opened up about how their distinctively different looks had often made life difficult at school			1
red - haired @entity8 said her pale complexion had prompted speculation that she 'd been adopted : ' my classmates used to ask if i was adopted because my siblings are all quite dark			2
' it was pretty hard , it went on in secondary school and it was n't very nice			0
' when the girls were first born in 1997 , their mother @entity13 had no idea that she could give birth to such different looking twins , described by experts as a one - in - a - million chance			1
growing up , the girls said they regularly overheard people asking their mum ' which one is yours ? ' or ' are you the childminder ? '			2
although most of their friends now know their unique story , they still have to present new acquaintances with photos of their birth certificates to prove they really are twin sisters			0
' our friends do believe us now because we make a big fuss , ' says @entity9			2
' we 've got birth certificates			0
@entity8 even had a picture of hers on her @entity25 [ profile ]			2
' as the girls have turned into grown - ups they 've tried to find their own style			0
@entity8 , who has naturally curly hair , straightens it to ensure a sleek look			2
and the twins stopped wearing the same outfits when they were seven			0
@entity8 says : ' i think i said to my mum : " i do n't want to wear the same clothes as @entity9 any more "			1
' same same , but different : @entity8 and @entity9 , 18 , from @entity34 are non-identical twins when asked at what age the girls knew their situation might raise questions from others , they say it took them a long time to know that their family was anything but ordinary			1
' it is what it is , ' says @entity9			2
' we never even picked up on it until friends started talking about it at school			0
' their mother , who is 47 and a warehouse worker , and their 53 - year - old father , who works as a scaffolder , split up after the twins were born			1
the 18 - year - olds have three older siblings , @entity108 , 23 , @entity109 , 22 , and @entity110 , 21			0
@entity8 told the @entity111 : ‘ our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween @entity9 and i. we are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween			1
‘ but my grandmother has a very fair @entity118 rose complexion , just like mine			0
’ she added : ‘ no one ever believes we are twins			0
even when we dress alike , we still do n’t look like sisters , let alone twins			0
’ family line : the twins ' mother @entity13 is half @entity14 and their father @entity15 is white , and their siblings @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 all have darker skin than @entity8 and lighter than @entity9 two of a kind : the twins , who live in @entity34 , were born in january 1997 @entity131 studies law at @entity133 , while ' shy ' @entity8 studies art and design at @entity136 all together : @entity9 and @entity8 with their mother @entity13 and siblings @entity108 , 23 , @entity109 , 22 , and @entity110 , 21 non-identical twins come from separate eggs , so inherit different genes			1
the girls ’ half - @entity14 mother carries genes for both white and black skin			1
by chance , @entity8 will have inherited genes for white skin and @entity9 will have genes that code for black skin			1
people with @entity155 heritage often have some @entity157 dna , dating back in many cases to the slave trade			0
this increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin			0
@entity8 said of her time at school : ‘ we were in the same class , but no one had a problem telling us apart			2
@entity170 are known for swapping identities			0
but there was no way @entity9 and i could ever do anything like that			0
‘ most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we could n’t look more different if we tried			0
we do n’t look like we have the same parents , let alone having been born at the same time			0
’ the twins ’ interests are as different as their looks			0
@entity8 studies art and design at @entity136 whilst @entity9 studies law at @entity133			1
@entity8 explained : ‘ @entity9 was outgoing whilst i was the shy one			1
but @entity9 loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and i ’m very proud of having a black twin			2
