who needs airport bartenders when there 's a perfect pint pulling machine to do all the hard work ? this genius automated beer dispenser is quite the draw in the @entity9 at @entity11 's @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
the @entity13 machine works exactly like a fountain drinks dispenser but with one very important extra : it has a tilt feature to help drinkers get the right amount of head on their drink , without spilling a single drop			2
self - service : a man grabs a glass and prepares to use the automated draft beer dispenser thirsty travellers help themselves to a chilled pint glass and simply place it on the drinks stand , before pressing a button on the machine			1
with a soft , robotic whirr the back of the stand swiftly moves forward , gently tilting as golden liquid streams down from the overhead nozzle			0
pour : the man places the glass in the machine and presses the buttons tilt : moments later the machine tilts the glass at the required angle and pours in the beer head : the machine then straightens up the glass and a head is poured into the glass creating the perfect pint as the pint glass gets filled , the stand reverts to its original position and a six - second spurt from the machine fills the rest of the glass with a perfect head			0
the perfectly poured suds are now ready to drink the automated draft beer dispenser is one of only an estimated five in the country			2
the machines have been around for quite some time but are uncommon outside of international departure lounges .			0
