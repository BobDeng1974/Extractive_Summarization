by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:23 est , 27 december 2013 @entity3 : 16:01 est , 28 december 2013 @entity4 has confirmed that customers ' encrypted pin data was i fact removed during the catastrophic hack that occurred earlier this month			1
the company issued a statement friday that additional forensic work has shown that encrypted pin data was removed along with customers ' names and card numbers			2
but @entity4 says it believes the pin numbers are still â € ˜ safe and secureâ € ™ because the information was strongly encrypted			1
it says the pin can only be decrypted when received by its independent payment processor			0
according to the company , the decryption key needed to translate the unintelligible code back into the pin was not stolen during the breach because it was not in @entity4 's system			1
' we remain confident that @entity18 numbers are safe and secure , ' company spokeswoman @entity36 said in a statement cited by @entity40			0
' the pin information was fully encrypted at the keypad , remained encrypted within our system , and remained encrypted when it was removed form our systems			2
' data connected to about 40 million credit and debit cards used at @entity4 were stolen between november 27 and december 15			1
@entity48 - based @entity4 says it is still in the early stages of investigating the breach			2
@entity51 insisted earlier this week that ' no unencrypted pin data was accessed ' and there was no evidence that pin data has been ' compromised '			0
she confirmed that some ' encrypted data ' was stolen , but declined to say if that included encrypted @entity58			1
denied : @entity4 says there is no evidence @entity58 were compromised as part of the retail behemoth embarrassing and worrisome @entity64 security breach one major @entity66 bank fears that the thieves would be able to crack the encryption code and make fraudulent withdrawals from consumer bank accounts , said the executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data breach is still under investigation			1
the hackers who attacked @entity4 and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers , according to a senior payments executive familiar with the situation			1
' we continue to have no reason to believe that pin data , whether encrypted or unencrypted , was compromised			2
and we have not been made aware of any such issue in communications with financial institutions to date , ' @entity51 said by email			0
' to date , there is no evidence that unencrypted pin data has been compromised , ' @entity4 said in a statement ' in addition , based on our communications with financial institutions , they have also seen no indications that any pin data was compromised , ' @entity4 said the no. 3 @entity66 retailer said last week that hackers stole data from as many as 40 million cards used at @entity4 stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season , making it the second - largest data breach in @entity66 retail history			1
@entity4 has not said how its systems were compromised , though it described the operation as ' sophisticated '			1
the @entity109 and the @entity110 are investigating			0
officials with both agencies have declined comment on the investigations			0
the news comes as the retailer says it has learned of some incidents of scam emails related to its recent data breach			0
the company says it is aware of ' limited instances ' of scam emails , but does not have specific information			0
the @entity48 retailer says it is creating a section of its website for @entity4 's official communications so customers can verify the authenticity of notes from the retailer			2
the attack could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars , but it is unclear so far who will bear the expense			0
@entity136 reports the company faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status as a result of the cyber-attack			1
the suits were filed by people who claim their information was stolen , and they allege @entity4 either failed to properly secure the customer data , did not promptly notify customers of the breach or both			2
but so little information disclosed so far about the breach , it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations			0
hacked : the hackers who attacked @entity4 and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also allegedly managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers meanwhile , @entity159 , @entity160 of @entity161 and @entity162 of @entity163 , have asked the @entity164 to investigate the breach			1
' if @entity4 failed to adequately protect customer information , it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects their personal information , ' @entity160 said in a letter to @entity164 chairwoman @entity173 today			2
' its conduct would be unfair and deceptive			0
' while bank customers are typically not liable for losses because of fraudulent activity on their credit and debit cards , @entity175 and @entity176 said they have lowered limits on how much cash customers can take out of teller machines and spend at stores			2
the unprecedented move has led to complaints from consumer advocates about the inconvenience it caused from the late november @entity192 holiday into the run - up to @entity194			0
but sorting out account activity after a fraudulent withdrawal could take a lot more time and be worse for customers			0
@entity175 has said it was able to reduce inconvenience by giving customers new debit cards printed quickly at many of its branches , and by keeping branches open for extended hours			0
a @entity176 spokeswoman was not available for comment today			0
security experts said it is highly unusual for banks to reduce caps on withdrawals , and the move likely reflects worries that @entity58 have fallen into criminal hands , even if they are encrypted			2
' that 's a really extreme measure to take , ' said @entity218 , a @entity219 analyst who specializes in cyber security and fraud detection			0
' they definitely found something in the data that showed there was something happening with cash withdrawals			0
' litigation : @entity4 reportedly faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status while the use of encryption codes may prevent amateur hackers from obtaining the digital keys to customer bank deposits , the concern is the coding can not stop the kind of sophisticated cyber criminal who was able to infiltrate @entity4 for three weeks			1
@entity241 , ceo of @entity242 , a cyber security consulting firm , said banks were prudent to lower debit card limits because they will not know for sure if @entity4 's pin encryption was infallible until the investigation is completed			1
as an example of potential vulnerabilities in pin encryption , @entity241 said he once worked for a retailer who hired his firm to hack into its network to find security vulnerabilities			0
he was able to access the closely guarded digital ' key ' used to unscramble encrypted @entity58 , which he said surprised his client , who thought the data was secure			1
in other cases , hackers can get pins by using a tool known as a ' @entity264 ' , which captures the @entity58 while they are temporarily stored in memory , @entity241 said			1
the attack on @entity4 began on november 27 , the day before the @entity192 holiday and continued until december 15			1
banks that issue debit and credit cards learned about the breach on december 18 , and @entity4 publicly disclosed the loss of personal account data on december 19			1
on december 21 , @entity175 , the largest @entity66 bank , alerted two million of its debit cardholders that it was lowering the daily limits on atm withdrawals to $ 100 and capping store purchases with their cards at $ 500			2
on monday , the bank partly eased the limits it had imposed on saturday , setting them at $ 250 a day for @entity282 withdrawals and $ 1,000 a day for purchases			0
( the usual debit card daily limits are $ 200 to $ 500 for cash withdrawals and $ 500 for purchases , a bank spokeswoman said last week			1
) on monday , @entity176 - a unit of @entity290 's @entity176 - followed suit , lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and purchases on @entity176 and @entity294 branded debit and credit cards of customers who used them at @entity4 when the breach occurred			1
@entity176 did not disclose the new limits , but said it was monitoring the accounts and issuing new cards to customers who were affected			0
the largest breach against a @entity66 retailer , uncovered in 2007 at @entity304 , led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months .			1
