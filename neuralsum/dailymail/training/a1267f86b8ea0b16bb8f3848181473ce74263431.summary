by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 22 november 2012 @entity2 : 07:37 est , 22 november 2012 a @entity4 robot designed to withstand high levels of radiation and extreme heat at damaged nuclear plants froze as it was unveiled for the first time yesterday			2
the failure occurred as @entity11 presented the four - legged device , forcing embarrassed technicians to meekly carry it away			0
although it is a world leader in robotics , @entity4 did not have a device capable of entering the damaged @entity19 nuclear facility after last year 's devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
embarrassment : @entity11 engineers carry away their company 's new four - legged , nuclear - proof robot after it froze during a its first public demonstration on its testing ground at the firm 's @entity28 complex yesterday @entity30 cocked : staff look bemused as the robot breaks down mid-step instead , authorities were forced to bring in @entity36 robots to survey the extent of the damage inside the devastated reactor buildings			2
@entity11 's machine , which was designed to plug the gap , is able to carry up to 20kg of equipment and is capable of lifting itself up if it falls over on uneven surfaces and amid debris			1
standing just over one metre tall , the @entity47 robot weighs 65kg and is equipped with sensors to detect radiation levels and a camera so investigators can operate the machine from a safe distance			1
its multiple - jointed legs are controlled via a dedicated movement algorithm that gives it the ability to negotiate uneven surfaces , avoid objects and even climb stairs to reach areas wheeled robots can not access			0
when it works ... @entity11 's machine is able to carry up to 20kg of equipment and is capable of lifting itself up if it falls over on uneven surfaces and amid debris nimble : the @entity47 robot 's multiple - jointed legs are controlled via a dedicated movement algorithm that gives it the ability to negotiate uneven surfaces , avoid objects and even climb stairs the machine also carries a smaller companion robot mounted with a second camera which can be deployed via a folding arm to enter narrow spaces and tubes its mothership is too large to enter			1
@entity11 said it is still developing the capabilities and operation of the robot to give it the ability to carry and install radiation shielding , stem flows of water and remove obstacles from its path			2
however , it seems that they also have some more basic technical glitches to iron out as , during the demonstration , the robot experienced a case of stage fright			0
the shuffling @entity47 locked up and suddenly froze after it tried to balance itself			0
needs work : @entity11 said it is still developing the capabilities and operation of the robot to give it the ability to carry and install radiation shielding , stem flows of water and remove obstacles from its path it is the second time such @entity4 robotic technology has experienced problems			1
last october , a crawling robot developed by the @entity112 lost connection with operators and was abandoned inside @entity19 's no. 2 reactor building			0
@entity4 is home to the largest number of industrial robots in the world , and although still at a relatively early stage in their development , they are already being put to a range of uses in @entity4 , from making sushi , to passing @entity127 € ™ s entrance examinations , @entity116 reported .			0

@entity4 is world leader in robotics but had no machine to enter @entity19 plant after *meltdown* last year
@entity11 's @entity47 machine walks on four legs , weighs 65kg and is able to carry up to 20kg
it is equipped with radiation sensors , a camera for remote operators and a separate *mini-robot* that can *explore* small spaces
