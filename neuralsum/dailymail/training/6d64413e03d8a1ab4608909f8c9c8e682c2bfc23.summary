by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:50 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 27 march 2012 @entity2 got his first @entity4 close - up monday			1
the headline - grabbing @entity4 backup qb went out of his way to play down any conflict between himself and starter @entity9			1
acquired last wednesday from @entity11 , the exciting but flawed quarterback is coming off a season of incredible comebacks with the @entity11			0
the @entity14 are hoping he has more surprises left in him			0
@entity2 's new club threw him a quick challenge on monday , sending him out alone to take questions at what was probably the biggest news conference ever for a second - string @entity22 player			1
asked if he and lead quarterback @entity9 are on good terms , @entity2 responded : ' me and @entity9 have a great relationship			1
' we 've been friends past three years and have already texted back and forth			0
we are going to have a great working relationship and i think we 'll have a lot of fun together			0
' coach @entity44 , general manager @entity45 and owner @entity46 were not at the @entity14 field house			1
they were down at the @entity22 meetings in @entity50 , @entity51 , far away from the wild scene at the team 's headquarters			2
teamwork : @entity2 said he was ' excited ' to work with head qb @entity9 @entity56 : the media crowds were at least six deep while @entity44 and @entity45 insist @entity9 is entrenched as the first - string quarterback , @entity2 will also see plenty of time on the field and certainly much more of the spotlight			1
@entity44 suggested on sunday that @entity2 could be used at a position other than quarterback			1
he kept referring to @entity2 as a ' football player , ' his ability not limited to quarterback			1
' i do n't see @entity2 just holding a clipboard , ' @entity44 told a group of reporters while in @entity51 for a meeting of @entity22 team owners			1
' he 's going to be playing for us			0
' @entity44 added : ' there wo n't be a better wildcat quarterback in the game			0
is that his only role ? i do n't believe that			0
' @entity2 said first and foremost he 's a quarterback , and that 's his hope and dream , but ' however i can help the team , i am open to it			1
' the newest @entity87 has already helped his team get some attention			0
while the club claims the trade for @entity2 was a football - related move , it was also marketing gold as the polarizing qb has occupied the back - and , in some cases , the front - pages of the @entity4 - area tabloids			1
and that 's just weeks after the @entity101 won their second @entity102 in four years			0
legions of fans have been snatching up @entity2 's green and white no. 15 jersey			1
the famed @entity106 in @entity107 already has a sandwich named after him , and @entity109 has a digital billboard ad outside the @entity111 - on the @entity113 side - with the underwear company saying it supports ' @entity2 & @entity4			2
' tebowing : @entity2 , known for his famous position of prayer , was traded by the @entity11 leader of the pack : @entity9 was drafted by the @entity14 in 2009 it 's been a whirlwind of a few weeks for @entity2 , who just last month was declared @entity11 's starting quarterback going into this summer by @entity122			1
not long after that , @entity123 was suddenly in town and @entity2 was told he could get traded			0
so much for ' @entity126 ' in @entity11			0
well , it has hit @entity128 in full force , making ' @entity130 ' and the @entity132 ' sensational @entity131 seem like a distant memory			0
@entity123 was introduced as the @entity11 ' newest quarterback last tuesday , and just over 24 hours later , @entity2 was on the move , surprisingly headed to @entity4			2
and then , he was n't			0
a snag in the deal held things up between the @entity14 and @entity11 , the delay centred on a salary advance due @entity2			1
@entity141 , once considered one of the favourites to land their hometown star , jumped back in the hunt			0
but eight hours later , the @entity14 finally completed the trade , agreeing to pay half of the $ 5million @entity11 owed @entity2			2
there was yet one more delay before the trade became official , as a technicality required @entity2 to sign a rewritten contract which kept him on the @entity11 ' salary cap until saturday afternoon			0
but now @entity2 is here , a member of the @entity14			2
and they intend to make things work with him and @entity9 , who was given a contract extension that included $ 20.5million guaranteed less than two weeks ago			0
bucking bronco : seen left to right , @entity11 owner @entity157 , new quarterback @entity123 and general manager @entity122 leader : manning , number 18 , was traded from the @entity160 he has n't commented publicly on the deal yet , but training camp up in quaint @entity164 , @entity165 , might be a pretty hot spot - especially if @entity9 struggles and restless fans push for more @entity2 , creating a quarterback controversy that could last all season			1
@entity14 fans have been decidedly mixed on the trade , with many wondering why the team would add a monster distraction to a locker room that had serious issues last season and was partly to blame for an 8 - 8 finish			2
@entity9 's leadership and confidence were questioned by some players , speaking anonymously in newspapers reports , and the addition of @entity2 could cut into the starting quarterback 's ability to regain the room			1
@entity186 ripped the trade , calling it ' a publicity stunt , ' and cornerback @entity188 wondered on @entity189 why the @entity14 would even need a guy like @entity2			2
he later reversed course , saying he supported @entity2 and the team , but there have been plenty of other critics who have made it clear that they think the @entity14 made the wrong move			2
while @entity2 took @entity11 from 1 - 4 to @entity201 champions last season , the 2007 @entity199 winner hit fewer than 50 per cent of his passes and often seemed more comfortable running than passing			2
throw in @entity2 's public displays of faith - he is a devout @entity206 - and he quickly has become a player who triggers a strong reaction from fans			1
but whether anyone likes it or not , @entity2 is part the @entity4 sports scene			0
now the @entity14 must figure out how to make it a winning addition			0

@entity2 says he 's ' excited ' to play with @entity14 qb @entity9
general manager *implied* @entity2 could play other position besides that of quarterback
news conference held in @entity14 field house and is ' largest turnout for second - string @entity22 player '
