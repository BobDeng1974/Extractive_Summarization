@entity0 expects brother @entity1 to be cheering him on in front of a television screen when @entity4 take on @entity5 on friday			1
@entity7 's side have defied expectations in the first three rounds of @entity11 qualifying by taking maximum points , all without @entity14 defender @entity13			0
the centre - half is arguably his country 's most high profile player , but a combination of suspension and injuries has kept him out of victories over @entity22 , the @entity23 and @entity24 , with a lingering ankle complaint also preventing him making the trip to @entity27			1
@entity0 ( right ) is set to be involved for @entity4 in their @entity11 qualifier with @entity5 @entity13 will miss @entity4 's match in @entity27 with an ankle ligament injury younger sibling @entity0 , meanwhile , played an important role in @entity33 and @entity34 and is expected to start again versus the second - placed @entity5			1
and , just as before , he is sure @entity1 will be kicking every ball with him			2
' @entity1 is obviously really frustrated he has n't been able to play so far in this campaign			1
he is desperate to get back because playing for @entity4 means the world to him , ' said @entity0			1
' i know from talking to him he is so eager to meet up with the lads and be a part of it all and more importantly , help us on the pitch			0
' he will be sitting at home again cheering us on and like the first three games			0
i know he will be the first person to text me after the game			0
' it is very difficult for him at the minute because things are going so well and he wants to feel a part of it like the rest of us			0
@entity7 's @entity4 side have won their first three @entity11 qualifiers they currently top @entity57 with nine points from a possible nine gained so far ' but once he is fit , i know he will be a major boost to our hopes of creating history by qualifying for the @entity63 for the first time			1
' after their stunning start to qualifying , @entity4 need only a point this week to remain top of @entity57 well into the new year			1
for a side who finished fifth in their last @entity74 group and dropped a seeding pot as a result , that would represent a huge achievement			0
' having the opportunity to remain at the top of the group until the next qualifier in march is a big deal for us , ' admitted the @entity85 midfielder			0
@entity86 celebrates his goal and @entity4 's second in the 2 - 0 win over @entity24 last time out @entity90 marks his goal in @entity4 's win over the @entity23 last month ' we want to remain unbeaten by the time we come home from @entity5 and a draw would be a good result			2
' there 's no doubting it is a massive game because @entity5 are second in the group and we are sitting at the top after three games			2
' we are going in to every game now believing we can get a result and so far we have done			0

@entity4 travel to @entity27 sitting top of @entity105
they have won their first three matches on the road to @entity110 2016
@entity0 has played an important role so far and should play again
but his brother @entity1 will again sit out with his ankle ligament injury
