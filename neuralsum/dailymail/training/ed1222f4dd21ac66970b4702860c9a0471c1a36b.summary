the @entity1 administration official closest to the disastrous rollout of @entity3 dodged questions from a congressional committee chairman – eight separate times – about how many @entity7 have signed up for coverage through government - run marketplaces			1
@entity11 administrator @entity10 refused to provide hard numbers to @entity14 chair rep. @entity13 , a @entity16 @entity15 , saying only that ' we 'll have that information available until mid-november			1
' that practiced phrase would come back time and time again			0
yet ' we have a system that 's working , ' she told dumbfounded @entity23 on the panel			1
' it 's just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want			2
@entity10 said tuesday only that 700,000 @entity7 nationwide have filled out applications for coverage , the first step toward enrollment			1
' then they go into the shopping experience where they can look at plans , ' she said			0
@entity10 also would not say how many of those 700,000 applicants were seeking @entity59 coverage , instead of a traditional medical insurance policy with paid premiums and out - of - pocket costs			1
some media reports have estimated that as many as 80 per cent are lower - income applicants signing up for @entity59 , a taxpayer - funded , poverty - targeted program whose upper income limits were expanded under the @entity39 in states that choose to take advantage			1
@entity10 also said @entity70 and the public wo n't know until mid-november how many applicants are actually hoping to enroll in insurance policies			1
she said the same about statistics that would show how many young people have applied to participate			0
next up : @entity77 secretary @entity76 will be on the hot seat wednesday when she faces congressional questions about the @entity39 rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers the @entity1 administration needs approximately 7 million americans enrolled in the @entity39 scheme in order to make its books balance			2
that includes 2.3 million young and healthy people , whose monthly premiums are required to fund the skyrocketing medical costs of the old and sick			0
in the face of withering questions about the @entity39 website which is failing by every standard , @entity10 urged @entity7 to apply instead by mail , by phone , or through ' people in their communities			1
' that 's a reference to the @entity103 that has come under fire in some states for failing to background - check its participants			2
trouble : @entity10 told a congressional panel that @entity39 's website is ' fixable ' ' i want to apologize to you that the website is not working as well as it should , ' she said , while simultaneously insisting that ' there are more methods ' for submitting applications ' than just the website , and that 's important			1
' the @entity118 has focused on those other methods , including a phone line , paper applications and the @entity122 , since the glitch - prone website itself became the subject of late - night comedians ' jokes			2
but the @entity122 typically guide consumers through the website , and lack any other way to interface with the @entity39 system			1
the firms processing paper applications , too , enter their data into the website			0
and phone operators tell callers that when the website is down , they 're powerless to help			0
ultimately , @entity10 insisted , ' this healthcare.gov site is fixable			2
' @entity141 @entity140 rep. @entity140 demanded to know why the website was n't ready on time			2
' you have had nearly four years to get it ready , ' @entity140 sniped			2
' why should the @entity7 people believe you now ? ' ' my constituents are frightened , ' he said			1
' they are being forced out of health care plans they like			0
the federal website is broken			0
their health care is n’t a " glitch			0
" ' @entity13 was equally unimpressed			0
' no amount of website fixes can make right the president 's broken promises that health care costs will be lowered by $ 2,500 , ' he said , ' or that @entity7 will be able to keep the plan they have and like			1
' sen. @entity163 demanded hhs secretary @entity76 ' resignation on tuesday , saying that at least 1.5 million @entity7 are losing their health insurance because their policies are not legal under @entity39 one contentious exchange between @entity10 and @entity169 @entity168 rep. @entity41 highlighted what may be a loophole in the @entity39 website 's application process			1
@entity14 chairman rep. @entity13 needled @entity10 over and over about the @entity39 system 's enrollment success rates , but got the same rehearsed answer each time top brass at the @entity47 , @entity41 said , have testified that they wo n't be able to confirm until 2016 whether consumers are eligible for health insurance subsidies in 2014			1
the @entity1 administration 's decision to delay for 1 year the so - called ' employer mandate ' under the law has created a 12 - month during which companies are n't required to provide information about which of their workers are covered by group insurance plans			1
also of particular interest are those under 26 years old who are covered by their parents ' insurance policies , @entity41 said			0
neither group is eligible for subsidies			0
but it 's unclear whether healthcare.gov is capable of verifying an applicant 's ' yes ' or no ' statement about those scenarios			2
' are we really verifying at the front end whether a person is eligible for the subsidy or not ? ' he asked			0
@entity10 pointed to ' help instructions ' and reminders that applicants are filling out online forms ' under penalty of perjury			1
' under the @entity39 , @entity7 who wrongly receive subsidies will be charged for them when they submit a tax return that claims a refund , an outcome that @entity41 called ' a rude awakening			1
' @entity39 call center employees like these in @entity223 depend on the healthcare.gov website to walk consumer through the @entity39 application process , rendering them less - than - helpful when the site is down in the @entity229 , two key @entity168 lashed out on tuesday			1
' it 's getting harder to tell the @entity39 headlines from the @entity39 punchlines these days , ' quipped @entity229 minority leader @entity232			2
' paper applications , 800 numbers , applying by fax ; @entity39 appears to be leading us boldly into the 1980s			0
' and sen. @entity163 , the @entity15 who is the @entity168 's ranking member on the @entity229 health committee , called openly for the resignation of hhs secretary @entity76			0
' no private sector ceo would escape accountability after such a poor performance , ' said @entity163			0
' expecting this secretary to be able to fix in a few weeks what she has not been able to fix during the last three and one half years is unrealistic			0
it is throwing good money after bad			0

@entity10 provided few answers in a @entity14 hearing tuesday
' we have a system that 's working , ' she *boasted*
@entity39 website is n't verifying applicants ' *eligibility* for subsidies , instead reminding them that they risk perjury charges by lying
the one - year delay of the employer mandate means the @entity47 wo n't know until 2016 whether people told the truth about 2014 subsidies
' you have had nearly four years to get it ready , ' sniped one congressman . ' why should the @entity7 people believe you now ? '
