by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 08:32 est , 3 october 2013 @entity2 is to do battle with @entity4 in the richest fight ever to involve a @entity7 boxer			1
@entity10 ’s former @entity9 hero will meet the greatest pound - for - pound fighter in the world in @entity13 on may 3			0
@entity2 ’s share of this $ 200million blockbuster is expected to be no less than $ 6m and is likely to climb to at least double that from pay - tv sales on both sides of the @entity19			1
the mask produced five times as much oxygen as breathing normal air			0
just sitting in the oxygen chamber produces 41 per cent oxygen			0
the official announcement will be made in the next few days and @entity2 has already pulled out of his challenge to world welterweight champion @entity42 , scheduled for december 7 in @entity43 , to ensure that his dream fight with @entity4 is not jeopardised			1
@entity2 is being given this opportunity of a lifetime thanks to a conviction in @entity48 that his exceptional speed will present a unique test to @entity4 , who has dealt imperiously with all threats from bigger and supposedly stronger foes			2
@entity53 , head of sports for the giant @entity56 cable tv network which bankrolls both men , says : ‘ @entity4 has seen off the tough , heavy punchers			0
it remains to be seen what he will do against extreme speed and i like the @entity2 fight very much			1
’ @entity2 had already begun preparing in @entity62 to face @entity42 and will remain almost permanently in camp there with his new trainer @entity64 for the next seven months			1
@entity4 had expressed interest in fighting at @entity66 but reliable sources in @entity48 confirm that prospect has been discounted on financial grounds			0
not only would an early - afternoon timing in the @entity48 compromise pay - per - view takings there but even a live gate of 70,000 at the stadium would generate revenue of no more than £ 7million			0
there are also significant tax benefits from boxing in @entity77			0
reaching out : @entity4 lands a punch against @entity25 as he extended his unbeaten record on the defensive : @entity2 was unconvincing in his victory over @entity22 but has the fight he wanted @entity4 ’s master - class victory over @entity25 broke the $ 20m ( £ 12.5m ) barrier for ticket sales at the @entity86 in @entity13 , while @entity56 pay - per - view subscriptions reached $ 157m … and rising			1
@entity2 ’s chance comes even though , as a two - time world light - welterweight champion , he lost his belts in successive bouts with @entity93 and @entity94			1
even though he has redeemed himself with comeback victories over @entity96 and another former world champion , @entity22 , he will be viewed in some quarters as jumping the queue to board the @entity4 money train			0
however , the ring ’s newest mantra is ‘ speed kills ’ and @entity103 , the promoters of both men , will be using that special asset of @entity2 ’s as a foundation of the massive marketing campaign to come			2
that will include a tv documentary series , with the episodes focusing on @entity2 providing an exotic and fascinating insight into the life and times of the world ’s pre-eminent , newly - wed @entity118 boxer			1
there will also be a multi-city promotional tour in the new year , which will bring @entity4 to @entity7			2
out of the ring : @entity4 at a basketball game and ( below ) @entity2 and his wife @entity123 at @entity124 initial public reaction is likely to be that @entity2 has little chance against the the superlative ring craftsman of his generation and he will enter the betting as a heavy underdog			2
those odds are likely to shorten , however , as boxing weighs up all the factors surrounding the most extraordinary evening of @entity2 ’s existence			2
while @entity4 is nothing short of being a genius in the ring he struggled in the early rounds against the speed of @entity140 – who @entity141 in six - before securing a points victory			0
nor is he a one - punch knockout artist like the two men to have stopped @entity2 , namely @entity94 and @entity146			1
@entity4 is more a cumulative puncher and when he stopped @entity149 six years ago the concussive effect was compounded by @entity151 ’s @entity150 striking his head against a corner post as he went down			0
high - profile defeat : @entity2 lost first to @entity93 ( above ) and then to @entity94 who knocked him out then there is the age factor			1
@entity2 , who will be 27 in december , is 10 years younger than @entity4 , who has announced that he is in the final stages of his career			1
this will be the third in his series of six fights with @entity56 on a contract expected to net him more than $ 200m			1
he has banked $ 41.5m from his virtuoso performance against @entity25 , with more to come when figures are in for overseas tv and merchandising revenue			0
it is unclear whether he will box on beyond the end of that contract in the autumn of 2015			0
that decision is likely to depend on whether he shows signs of slowing down			0
older boxers can hit the age barrier at any moment , virtually without notice			0
while that is unlikely to afflict @entity4 as early next may , the interim does give @entity2 the time to be in the most potent condition of his life			2
challenge : but @entity2 has been told to up his dedication to 100 per cent to reach @entity4 's level all smiles : but @entity4 ( centre ) has warned @entity2 ( left ) is has to earn the right to fight him @entity2 has promised @entity64 that he will eschew his celebrity lifestyle of late , after his trainer warned that nothing less will do from now on than @entity4 ’s exemplary , rigorous commitment to ‘ hard work and dedication			1
’ he will have to remain grounded through the star - spangled hype which will precede this happening of immense sporting magnitude , complete with its chat show appearances on network television			2
and where @entity25 whipped up the support and hard cash of tens of millions of his @entity205 fans , @entity2 will be expected to excite massive interest in @entity118 communities in @entity48 , @entity7 , the @entity208 and across the world			1
no matter how wary the @entity7 reservations may be about his chances of dethroning the great @entity4 , there is certain to be a trans - @entity19 invasion of @entity13 next spring			1
invasion : @entity13 was taken over when 30,000 @entity215 travelled to see @entity149 take on @entity4 while the number of supporters following @entity2 may not reach the 30,000 who made the pilgrimage for @entity149 ’s tilt at @entity4 in 2007 , the @entity7 interest seems certain to push the @entity223 gate revenue record for boxing in @entity77 even higher			1
and , in one crucial sense , the belief that @entity4 is omnipotent works heavily in favour of our highest profile ambassador for @entity230 relations			0
@entity2 is totally convinced that his speed and skills can overcome @entity4			2
even if he fails in that ambitious bid for ultimate ring glory , no - one will think any the worse of him			0
and if he were to lose heroically in a terrific fight he will enjoy enormous exposure and acclaim around the world – with his market value for future world title challenges as significantly enhanced as his experience of the mega-occasion			0
this , for @entity2 , this , is a no - lose situation .			2

$ 200m bout in may will be richest to involve a @entity7 boxer
@entity2 has pulled out of fight against @entity42 in december
newly - married @entity215 will shun celebrity lifestyle
he will remain in a training camp for the next seven months
trans - @entity19 invasion expected for the fight
