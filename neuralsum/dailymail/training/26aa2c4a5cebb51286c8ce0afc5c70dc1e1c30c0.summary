by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:28 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 23 november 2013 @entity2 faced increased pressure over his close relationship with the co-op last night as it emerged he lavished praise on the stricken bank even after it had racked up £ 1.5billion of debt			1
attending a fund - raising dinner , the @entity9 boasted that he was the ‘ co-operative shadow chancellor ’ who was ‘ looking forward to taking co-operation into the @entity12 when we get the chance ’			1
mr @entity2 also said the bank would go from ‘ strength to strength ’ – even though disgraced chairman @entity19 had just been forced out for what it is now known to be major concerns about his expenses			1
@entity2 ( left ) speaks to @entity23 at a reception at @entity25 for the launch of a co-op venture in 2010 the words further undermine mr @entity2 ’s attempts to distance himself from the @entity31 scandal and from @entity19 , who was arrested late on thursday night after revelations that he bought crystal meth , crack cocaine and ketamine			1
the senior @entity37 figure has received £ 50,000 in funding from the co-operative movement and refuses to hand the money back , saying he was ‘ proud ’ to accept it			1
on thursday , he said any attempts to link him to the scandal were ‘ smears ’			0
but , as @entity19 was bailed until the @entity45 after being quizzed by police over an ‘ ongoing drug supply investigation ’ , it emerged : the @entity48 has seen the transcript of a plush dinner at which the @entity9 gushed about how the ‘ fabulous ’ bank had emerged from the financial crisis as one of the strongest on the @entity54			1
the former chairman of the @entity31 , @entity19 the praise he heaped on the struggling bank at the annual co-op dinner on june 20 came despite the fact that just two weeks earlier , @entity19 had been forced out after it emerged the co-op bank had racked up a £ 1.5billion black hole of debt			1
mr @entity2 was forced to deny claims he was too close to the co-op after mr @entity19 told mps they had met at @entity37 functions			1
both men attended a reception at @entity70 in 2010 but mr @entity2 says they did not have a conversation			0
his denials were undermined when it emerged that he had bragged about his role in rubber - stamping legislation that paved the way for a disastrous takeover deal at the @entity79 op. mr @entity2 also accepted a £ 50,000 donation from the @entity81 in march 2012 , when @entity19 was chairman of the co-op bank			1
@entity37 has also benefited from millions of pounds in ‘ soft ’ loans with preferential rates of interest			1
earlier this week , mr @entity2 insisted that he had not held meetings with @entity87 , and said he had ‘ never in my life ’ had a conversation with him about the funding of his office			1
but on june 20 , the @entity9 hosted senior co-op executives and guests from the @entity94 at a private £ 70 - per - head dinner in a luxury @entity98 hotel			2
flowers had been on the guest list , but @entity37 sources said he did not attend			2
speaking about the co-operative movement , mr @entity2 said : ‘ we are going from strength to strength			1
i am the first ever @entity105			0
but , more importantly , i have a team of five in the @entity107 including me			0
three are women ; two are men			0
‘ three are co-operative and @entity37 mps : a majority of co-operators in the shadow @entity12 team , looking forward to taking co-operation into the @entity12 when we get the chance			1
’ he also drew attention to the fact that four ‘ fabulous ’ by - election successes over the last year had seen four more @entity37 and co-op mps in @entity123			1
‘ people ask : “ does being a @entity37 and co-operative mp help you get elected ? ” well , what we are seeing in this @entity123 is they are queuing up to be co-operative mps			2
because , we know , on the doorstep the values of our movement and the difference we make really makes a difference			0
’ mr @entity2 admitted that it had been a ‘ tough week ’ for the co-op movement , with @entity87 having just been forced out			1
but he added : ‘ let ’s be completely honest : the performance of the co-operative group over recent years has been fabulous , across all its many different retail businesses			2
and actually , as a bank , the co-operative bank was one of the institutions which came through the financial crisis strong enough to step in and help other organisations in difficulty and in trouble			0
‘ that commitment to local engagement , and to local values , the ability to innovate – that is important for the future			0
’ during the dinner there was an auction for mr @entity2 to make a lasagne for the co-operative member who made the winning bid			2
the auction proved so popular that mr @entity2 promised to make lasagnes for two members who had each bid £ 4,000			2
last night a @entity37 source said mr @entity2 had also talked in his speech about the difficulties at the bank , how there had been a change of management and that there were significant challenges ahead			1
the @entity12 was also dragged into the co-op scandal last night after former @entity175 leadership contender @entity174 questioned why officials had not spotted its financial problems years ago			0
regulators and @entity12 staff should have noticed its shortcomings back in 2011 , the mp said , when the financial problems were becoming visible			0
the co-op ’s financial woes were set out in a letter in january 2012 to the @entity186 board when it made its doomed bid to take over the banking giant			0
the letter was written by @entity189 , a city veteran who was heading a rival bid			0
mr @entity174 said that should have set alarm bells ringing to the @entity12 , @entity186 and @entity192 , which handled the government ’s stake in the @entity79 op. @entity19 racked up a £ 63,000 expenses and allowances bill at @entity199 before he was forced to resign over the discovery of porn on his laptop			1
the @entity48 has learned that the disgraced former co-op boss received the cash over three years while he was a councillor at the authority			2
last night a local government minister urged the authority to find out whether the claims are genuine			0
earlier this week this newspaper revealed that @entity19 is suspected of claiming as much as £ 75,000 in false expenses while heading a drugs charity			0
@entity19 claimed £ 63k in expenses while serving as a councillor in @entity199 he made claims for ‘ a lot of dining ’ and frequent hotel stays and travel , but resigned from the @entity219 before internal proceedings against him could be concluded			1
the co-op is also trawling through his expenses claims amid claims he may have used some of its money to fund his sordid lifestyle			0
it is believed that the head of the @entity81 became concerned about @entity19 ’s ‘ excessive use of expenses ’ before he resigned			2
the @entity233 minister claimed £ 63,103.77 in allowances , expenses and other perks from @entity199 – £ 13,362.84 in 2009/10 , £ 35,091.37 in 2010/11 and £ 14,649.56 in 2011/12			1
@entity237 , a @entity175 local government minister , said : ‘ this level of expenses seems suspiciously high and should be investigated			2
a full breakdown of what these expenses were and the business case for them needs to be looked at			0
’ @entity87 resigned after adult material was found on his computer , but colleagues were told at the time that he left because of pressures of his work at the co-op bank			1
the council ’s chief solicitor , @entity254 , said all the claims had already been checked			0
‘ all councillors ’ allowances and expenses are a matter of public record and are published on our website dating back to 2004/5 , ’ she added			2
‘ the basic allowance payable to all councillors is currently £ 13,042.94 a year			0
‘ special responsibility allowances are paid to councillors who have significant additional responsibilities such as being a member of the executive			0
‘ claims for travel , accommodation or meals are checked before any payments are made			0
the system for making payments is regularly audited			0
’ but @entity279 , of the @entity280 ’ @entity278 , said : ‘ given mr @entity19 ’s track record of expenses , taxpayers will be rightly concerned about how these councillor ’s allowances may have been used			1
‘ it further adds weight to the need for a full and proper investigation into what ’s happened during his time in power			0
