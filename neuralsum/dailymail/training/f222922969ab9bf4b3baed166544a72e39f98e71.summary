a 67 - year - old piano tuner who has worked for @entity2 and @entity3 is fighting to keep a beach house owned by his late parents against organizers of a major @entity9 development who are trying to tear down			1
@entity11 has refused a buyout from the state agency in charge of redeveloping the ailing resort city 's shrinking casino industry			1
the 93 - year - old home sits down the street from the failed $ 2.4 billion @entity19 , which will close for good this weekend			1
the state agency hope to transform the casino and its surrounds into a a two - and - a - half - block tourism district , but need to purchase the properties currently sitting on the land , including @entity11 's			1
the @entity45 wants to take the home where @entity11 parents lived , and where his mother was killed , even though the @entity36 is closing next week the three - story brick house belonged to his holocaust survivor parents and represents a great deal of family sentimentality			1
' this building gave ( my father ) dignity			0
it was his refuge , ' @entity11 said			2
' as it was for my mom when my dad passed away			0
because of this building , my dad did n't die in a nursing home			0
' not even the killing of his mother there during a 1998 robbery diminished @entity11 's beautiful memories of what the house meant for his family			1
it 's those memories that keep him from accepting a buyout			2
even with the hulking glass structure down the street preparing to sit empty after @entity36 closes this weekend , the @entity45 says it still wants to redevelop the nearby land where @entity11 's house sits			1
@entity11 's lawyer and an attorney representing other tenants affected by the redevelopment plans met thursday with a judge who is deciding whether the @entity45 has the right to force them out through eminent domain			1
the judge heard arguments from both sides in may and scheduled another hearing for october 6			0
though @entity11 does not live at the house , he still goes there almost daily			2
he uses the first floor for his business tuning pianos played in the city 's casinos , and to play the piano still in the living room , which is surrounded by pictures of his family			2
' the building has been my refuge in a similar way , ' he said			0
' i 've been able to continue making a living and doing what i do			0
' clientele : @entity11 taught himself how to tune pianos as a child and went on to work with numerous stars in @entity9 , including @entity2 ( pictured here in 1954 ) the building is one of a few inhabited properties that dot the landscape , surrounded by patches of grass and undeveloped lots with for - sale signs			1
his parents , @entity119 survivors , bought the house in 1969 for $ 13,000 when @entity11 was in college , and he still rents out its two apartments			2
according to the @entity124 , @entity11 's parents were @entity125 jews who escaped the @entity126 by hiding out in forests and joining the partisans			2
his mother , @entity129 , lost her first husband and a three - year - old daughter to @entity133 slaughter , and his father , @entity134 , lost his wife			1
the pair married and in july 1944 @entity129 gave birth to the couple 's first son , @entity138 , who she delivered herself during the war			0
the family moved to @entity142 to live with a relative in 1952 before relocating to @entity144			0
when @entity11 suffered a psychotic breakdown while studying music at @entity148 , his father decided to move the family to @entity9 , buying the home at 311 @entity150 in 1969 for $ 13,000			1
@entity151 , an attorney representing @entity11 from the @entity153 - based @entity152 , said the @entity45 does n't have any concrete plans to redevelop the area and is out to ' destroy @entity157 home '			1
' they 're just moving forward no matter what to create more vacant land in @entity9 , ' @entity151 said			2
determined : @entity11 said his commitment to keeping his @entity9 house was to honor his parents @entity164 , a spokeswoman for the redevelopment agency , said she could n't comment on @entity11 's case , but that the agency is ' accumulating land that makes it attractive for developers to buy '			1
the opening of @entity36 two years ago had inspired plans for the surrounding @entity174 area , including a $ 75 million entertainment complex proposed by a group that includes former @entity178 star @entity177			0
the @entity45 had planned to use its share of revenue from @entity36 — 1.25 percent of gambling winnings — to pay for a $ 50 million bond to buy and clear several blocks			0
but @entity36 's struggles led the agency to use a more modest $ 8.5 million to remake the neighborhood			0
@entity11 , who lives 30 miles inland in @entity187 and has made a living by tuning pianos at the casinos for @entity2 , @entity3 and others , said he was offered fair market value for his family 's house , about $ 240,000			1
he said he would leave if he was given a detailed reason on what the city wants to do with the land			0
' i was hoping that my parents would see some turnaround and some progress , and now i 'm hoping and praying that i 'll be the one that sees the turnaround and progress in spite of @entity36 and in spite of @entity208 and ( @entity210 ) @entity209 , because we 've gone through some tough times , ' he said			0
' and if it means going through more tough times , so be it			0
