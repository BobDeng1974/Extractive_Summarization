@entity1 ’s reputation at home and abroad is in tatters after it emerged they have been responsible for a trail of misinformation and confusion over their signing of @entity10			1
@entity1 are already fighting to keep the @entity12 public onside after their decision to retain @entity10 ’s services for the second half of the @entity17 season , rather than release him to play in @entity18 for feeder club @entity19 as planned			1
the club ’s image took a further pounding after they were forced to admit they had unintentionally misled the public on both sides of the @entity26 from the moment it was announced @entity10 had ‘ signed ’ for @entity19 on a two - year deal last summer			1
@entity1 have admitted that they have misled fans and @entity31 over @entity10 city had wrongly claimed that @entity10 signed for @entity31 last summer before agreeing a loan move @entity35 apps : 3 starts ( 12 sub apps ) @entity37 : 5 @entity38 : 1 goals : 0 @entity40 : 1 goals : 2 @entity42 : 1 ( 1 ) @entity37 : 0 @entity43 : 6 ( 13 ) total goals : 7 that , was not true			1
nor was the subsequent announcement that the 36 - year - old had joined @entity1 on a ‘ loan ’ until the end of the calendar year			1
the truth , admitted by @entity1 , is that @entity10 put his name only to a pre-contract agreement with @entity19 , stipulating that he would join them on january 1			1
the only binding contract he signed was with @entity1 , one that saw him contracted to the club for one season with a ‘ break clause ’ inserted that would enable him to head to @entity31 for @entity18 pre-season in january if deemed convenient			1
we know now that @entity1 , quite legally , removed that clause on @entity66 in order to keep him until the end of the season			2
under pressure from the media and unhappy fans in @entity12 , @entity1 finally admitted some of this on friday only to then find themselves in trouble with the @entity17			0
@entity10 is mobbed by @entity78 team - mates @entity79 and @entity80 after scoring against @entity81 the former @entity83 man is pictured in action during @entity1 's @entity17 clash with @entity81 the whole affair has left supporters on both sides of the @entity26 angry and confused , click here to read @entity91 's six questions that must be answered			1
in releasing five points of clarification friday lunchtime , @entity1 admitted making ‘ mistakes ’ and ‘ errors ’ in their initial announcements regarding @entity10			1
however , the @entity17 were furious to see @entity1 claiming that @entity10 ’s contract with them had only been until december 31 and that there had been no break clause			2
instead , @entity1 claimed , @entity10 had merely signed a second short - term contract with them on december 31			1
this angered @entity17 officials as not only was it not true , it would also have been in direct contravention of @entity106 that stipulates no player contract can be for less than 12 months			0
after contact from the @entity109 , @entity1 backed down and privately conceded that @entity10 ’s contract had been for the whole season			1
but they have not broken any rules throughout and will not face any punishment			0
but friday the headline in the influential @entity115 labelled the whole @entity10 situation as a ‘ fraud ’			0
even though representatives from @entity19 are due to meet disgruntled fans for talks today , it seems all goodwill in @entity18 has already been lost			2
over here , @entity1 face searching questions about why the whole saga has been characterised by untruth and misinformation from the start			0
@entity1 ’s stance friday was that the initial announcements — in @entity31 and @entity132 — were simple mistakes			2
@entity10 's deal to join @entity31 will now begin in the summer after he completes the season with @entity1 the midfielder ( right ) released a statement on his @entity139 page on friday denying that he misled @entity18 fans there is no direct proof to the contrary but it seems incredible that a club of @entity1 ’s size — with an ever expanding communications team — could make such an error , given that announcements about @entity10 ’s ‘ signing ’ were followed up by tweets and other social media news flashes essentially carrying the same message			1
one school of thought , popular in @entity12 , is that it was in @entity31 and @entity19 ’s best interests to announce @entity10 ’s ‘ signing ’ to help season - ticket sales along in the @entity12			1
@entity1 deny this and say the announcement was just an error			0
it would perhaps not have had the same effect had it been revealed that he had actually signed for @entity1 with a clause meaning he ‘ may ’ come to @entity31 in january			2
that is all speculative and suggestions that @entity10 never intended to switch to @entity31 this month are quite wrong			2
it is only @entity10 ’s impressive form on the field that has seen him retained			0
he has simply proved more valuable to manager @entity170 than anybody ever imagined he would			0
i want to make it completely clear about my situation as i have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days			0
when released from @entity83 last year at the end of my contract i signed a commitment to play in @entity19 for two years starting january 1 2015			1
i was then offered the chance to train and be part of the @entity1 squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into @entity31			2
this period has since been extended by @entity1 and i now will start playing for @entity19 at the end of this current @entity17 season			1
there has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone			0
i can say that i am very excited about arriving in @entity31 and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the @entity18 as soon as possible			1
thanks everyone for your ongoing support and i wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015 ! @entity10 holds up a @entity19 scarf after ' joining ' the @entity18 club at the end of last season @entity10 has scored seven goals since joining @entity1 to help them draw level with his former club @entity83 calls made to @entity10 ’s representatives to ask why a former @entity209 captain allowed himself to be part of something that has subsequently turned out to be misleading were also not returned			1
earlier on , however , @entity10 did issue a statement designed to ‘ clear up ’ any confusion			0
the statement said : ‘ i want to make it completely clear about my situation as i have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days			0

’ aug 2014 @entity10 joins @entity1 ‘ @entity245 ’ man city : ‘ @ mcfc midfielder joins # mcfc on loan * ’ * @entity1 posted a link to the story on their website but the page has been removed			1

’ @entity256 2014 pellegrini says @entity257 @entity258 : ‘ it is not impossible for him to stay here			0

’ oct 2014 @entity263 suggests he could extend his stay @entity10 : ‘ i am here until january 1 so i will focus on that and see what happens then			0

’ dec 2014 pellegrini wants frank until end of season @entity258 : ‘ of course i want him to stay			0

’ jan 2015 @entity10 sticks with city @entity283 @entity31 fans : ‘ we would like to denounce @entity10 ’s decision to extend his loan			2
many fans decided to support the team , committed to season tickets , and bought merchandise under the impression that @entity10 would be playing for @entity31 , not @entity1			1

@entity1 have admitted misleading supporters over @entity10 deal
the champions had *previously* claimed the former @entity83 star would be arriving on ' loan ' after signing for @entity31 fc
@entity1 now admit that the former @entity209 midfielder was not yet a @entity19 player when signing with the club on a supposed ' loan '
the 36 - year - old will now leave for the @entity18 at the end of the season
