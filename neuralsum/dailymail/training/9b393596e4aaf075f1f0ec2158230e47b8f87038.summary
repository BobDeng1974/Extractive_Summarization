by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 6:06 pm on 14th february 2012 @entity3 could be deported to @entity4 if the government chose to reject a @entity7 ruling , a former @entity9 minister said today			1
@entity10 said home secretary @entity11 should simply ignore the ruling in @entity13 that prevents @entity14 throwing out the hate preacher because he could stand trial for terrorism offences involving evidence gathered through torture			1
speaking after @entity20 was released from prison , he said : ' the ruling in @entity13 is a gnat - bite that the @entity14 government is totally free in law to ignore			1
' there is clearance up to the level of the @entity27 here to deport him to @entity4 , which is a friendly state with a civilised government			1
freed on bail : hate preacher @entity3 is released from @entity32 under the cover of darkness			1
it will cost £ 10,000 per week to keep him safe a convicted @entity37 terrorist is on the run after escaping from house arrest in @entity40			2
@entity43 extremist @entity41 , 46 , fled while being held under tight bail conditions at a hotel in the southern city of @entity47			2
his escape will fuel fears @entity3 may be helped to freedom from house arrest in @entity14			0
@entity41 had links to @entity53 , the deceased former leader of @entity54 in @entity55 , and also met @entity56 at terrorist training camps in @entity58 in 2000			2
he was arrested in 2002 for plotting bomb attacks on @entity40 targets , and sentenced to ten years in prison in 2007			2
he was released in december , pending a court ruling on whether to deport him back to @entity43			2
but - as also in the case of @entity3 - @entity7 has asked for him not to be sent back to his homeland over risks he may be tortured			2
it was not revealed exactly when former @entity43 soldier @entity41 escaped , but judicial sources said he had not reported to local police under his bail terms since january 22			0
one official source told @entity40 daily paper @entity71 : ' we have no idea at all where he is			0
he has vanished his lawyer @entity74 said he had ‘ no idea ’ where his client was , adding : ' but he has no money and does not have working papers for @entity40			0
' - @entity79 ' if the home secretary chose , as she should , to put him on a plane this morning and send him back , she would have broken no laws			1
he blamed ' paralysis ' within the coalition for mrs may ’s failure to act			0
he said : ' a combination of ( justice secretary ) @entity90 and the @entity91 makes this a political fight she feels she can not win so she is funking it			0
' his comments came as another former @entity97 minister added her voice to fears about the threat posed by @entity20 , who was released from prison last night			1
former security minister @entity103 said of the @entity37 extremist : ' he 's unlikely to be much of a risk at the moment under that degree of surveillance , but what we know is that 's not going to be a permanent situation if an agreement ca n't be somehow found within three months with the @entity4 government , so there 's a long - term risk there			1
' this is a man who ... has a record of preaching real violence			0
here 's a man who wished death upon others and i 'm less convinced that he 's somehow been neutralised , so we must regard him as a threat			1
' her comments came as @entity3 's own mother called for him to be kicked out of @entity14			2
today home office minister @entity130 was reported to have boarded a flight to @entity4 in a bid to broker a deal with @entity136 's home government to create the right conditions in which @entity14 could legally deport him			1
as the @entity141 extremist was released from jail , @entity139 , 70 , speaking from her home in the capital , @entity145 , insisted : ‘ @entity14 is very wrong to keep my son			2
’ she said @entity20 , once @entity56 ’s spiritual ambassador in @entity148 , would be better off to return home to face trial in @entity4			1
call for action : former conservative home office minister @entity10 , left , said @entity14 could ignore a @entity7 ruling and deport @entity20 , while @entity103 said @entity3 presented a long - term risk to the country she said : ‘ he has been away too long			1
we want him home now			0
i do n’t know why the @entity14 keep him			0
there is no good reason			0
i ca n’t see why they would want him			0
’ @entity3 was freed from high - security prison under cover of darkness last night			1
as well as a 22 - hour curfew , he is banned from contacting a list of terrorists including @entity54 chief @entity165 and hook - handed hate preacher @entity166			1
ministers are desperate to deport him and are pinning their hopes on a promise by @entity4 to ban the use in terror trials of evidence obtained by torture			1
the prospect of @entity20 , who is also known as @entity3 , being prosecuted using evidence obtained by ill - treatment led to the @entity7 ruling he must not be deported			1
in turn , @entity13 ’s judgment led directly to the @entity14 courts releasing him on bail yesterday			2
he is wanted in @entity4 in connection with plotting a terrorist atrocity to mark the millennium			2
in an exclusive interview , mrs @entity139 insisted her son was not a terrorist			0
but his brother and a close friend revealed how he was in regular phone contact with @entity56 until 2001 and thought the @entity195 leader was a ‘ wise man ’			1
bring him back : @entity3 's mother @entity139 , right , said her son should be allowed to return to @entity4			1
the ramshackle family home in @entity4 , left hate preacher : @entity20 pictured walking the streets of @entity199 before he went to prison they said @entity20 supported jihadist groups in @entity43 and @entity203 but denied he had any involvement in terror attacks in @entity4			1
his younger brother , @entity207 , 32 , said he wanted @entity20 to return to @entity4			1
‘ i wish very much to have him back , of course , but i am worried he will be tortured if he returns if there is not a special agreement to say he can not be harmed and that he will have fair treatment by the authorities , ’ he added			0
‘ i am very uncertain about whether that is possible			0
’ he last spoke to @entity20 two months ago when the preacher telephoned the family home from prison			1
‘ we are concerned about him , but he is a strong man who did not complain to us about prison life			0
‘ he will be much happier to be out though , i am certain about that			0
’ @entity3 ’s best friend from school , @entity224 , said : ‘ he spoke to @entity56 many , many times by phone , although they never met in person because they were never in the same country together			1
left - wing newspaper @entity232 today added its voice to the overwhelming calls for @entity3 to be deported from @entity14			0
despite its traditional pro-mass immigration stance , the newspaper acknowledged that ' there is not a soul in this country who thinks that @entity14 is a better place for the presence of @entity3			0
' in a leader article , it said : ' the case for deportation from this country is immensely strong			0
' it went on : ' deportation of @entity3 would clearly be the better course ... @entity14 would like to deport @entity3 to @entity4			1
' however , @entity232 also celebrates the fact @entity20 was released from prison because he has never been charged with a criminal offence in this country , calling his detention an abuse of the ' rule of law '			1
‘ before september 11 , speaking to @entity56 was not a big deal			1
‘ he admired @entity56 as a wise man who knew many things			2
he liked and respected him a lot			0
’ while fighting deportation , @entity20 , 51 , has been held for six - and - a - half years , more than any other detainee in modern immigration history			2
as ministers continued to work frantically to strike an extradition deal with @entity4 , @entity265 left open the door to defying @entity13 and simply putting @entity20 on a plane			1
such a move – while hugely popular with the @entity14 public and @entity273 mps – would bring the government into open conflict with @entity148			0
but , asked whether @entity14 could ignore the ruling , the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to removing him from the country			2
we want to see him deported			0
we are looking at all the options for doing that			0
’ the comments from @entity286 came as @entity273 @entity271 continued to heap pressure on the prime minister to remove @entity20			2
they point out other countries , including @entity290 and @entity40 , have kicked out terror suspects in clear defiance of the court ’s rulings			0
@entity273 mp @entity295 said : ‘ the lawyers have haggled and quibbled long enough			0
@entity20 is a threat to public protection and should be put on a flight back to @entity4			1
no ifs , no buts			0
’ and @entity273 mp @entity302 accused @entity13 of subverting the original founding principles of the @entity304			2
the taxpayer will have to find up to £ 10,000 a week to help protect @entity20 from vigilante attacks now that he has been released			1
police surveillance will require 60 officers a day divided over three shifts to keep a 24 - hour watch on him			0
@entity130 , the security minister , is due to fly to @entity4 to gain necessary assurances that will allow the @entity14 to deport @entity20			1
the case has become so sensitive that officials will not say publicly when the talks will take place			0
@entity317 , the government ’s former reviewer of terror laws , said : ‘ this should all have been sorted out long ago			0
freed : radical @entity141 cleric @entity3 was being held at @entity32 , in @entity321 , until he was released last night held : once described by a judge as @entity56 's right - hand man in @entity148 , @entity20 , 51 , was in a van which left the high - security @entity32 in @entity326 , @entity321 , ( pictured ) for his @entity199 home at about 9.15pm ‘ the incredulity of the public and the media is entirely justified			1
we have to find a way of making him leave			0
‘ there are legal rule of law ways of achieving that , it ’s a pity it was n’t done before			0
’ @entity338 , the shadow home secretary , said : ‘ as soon as the @entity7 judgement was delivered a month ago now the government could have appealed the decision and begun urgent negotiations with the @entity4 government			1
instead the government did nothing			0

just ignore @entity13 ruling and kick him out , @entity10 tells home secretary
