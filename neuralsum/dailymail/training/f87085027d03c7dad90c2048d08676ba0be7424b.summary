@entity0 has confirmed that a small foreign submarine illegally entered its waters off the coast of @entity4 last month			1
military officials said the nationality of the intruders can not be confirmed , but several defense analysts say @entity9 remains the likely culprit			2
@entity9 media has in turn responded by claiming that it was a @entity14 submarine , and accusing the @entity0 of cowardice and deliberately keeping the nationality a secret			1
proof : an image of the seabed off the coast of @entity4 which was provided as evidence of foreign submarine activity at today 's press conference the @entity25 ' commander - in - chief @entity24 confirmed the violation during a press conference this morning , held with prime minister @entity28 and defense minister @entity29			1
' the @entity0 armed forces can now confirm that a smaller submarine violated @entity0 territory , ' @entity24 said			1
' there is no doubt about this			0
we can rule out all other alternative explanations			0
' @entity24 added that the government is ' one - hundred per cent sure ' of the violation , which he calls ' deeply serious '			0
' it 's impossible to confirm any nationality			0
but we can confirm the fact that it has been there , ' @entity24 said			0
@entity0 's prime minister @entity28 , defence minister @entity29 , and the @entity25 ' commander - in - chief @entity24 arrive for a news conference in @entity4 where they confirmed that a small foreign submarine illegally entered its waters last month is this it ? this grainy amateur photo showing a mysterious vessel in @entity4 's archipelago was released by the @entity0 military during the hunt , the captions bottom right reads : ' object moves at speed through the water			1
heavy self - generated foaming ' prime minister @entity28 warned that such incursions into @entity0 territory presented ' enormous risks ' for those involved and that @entity0 would defend its borders ' with all available means '			1
should a nationality be confirmed at any point , it will be a major test for mr @entity28 , a former welder who has never even sat in parliament before becoming prime minister , and his @entity76 - @entity75 coalition government			0
during the week - long hunt for the intruders , it was reported to have been a @entity9 intrusion into @entity0 waters , and several defense experts maintain that this is the case			1
today , former foreign minister @entity84 made a thinly veiled hint at @entity9 responsibility , by tweeting : ' @entity25 ca n’t identify nationality of intruding submarine			1
looks like small green subs ' the ' small green subs ' refers to the @entity9 annexation of @entity93 , which began with ' green men ' landing on the @entity97 peninsula			2
the leader of the @entity99 , @entity98 , went even further , telling @entity100 , that there could be no other conclusion than that @entity9 was responsible			2
@entity9 media was quick to hit back , with @entity105 newspaper @entity104 accusing @entity14 of being responsible for the intrusion , and the @entity0 military of keeping schtum about it			1
' so it is about their own - @entity14			0
but to say that means admitting that the @entity9 are not responsible			0
' but the @entity0 military is clearly not able to take such a manly step			0
this is why mr @entity24 acts as if he had water in his mouth [ a @entity9 saying meaning ' clamming up ' ] any other logical explanation to his inability to announce which country the submarine was from , clearly does not exist , ' writes @entity122			2
under attack : although he @entity0 government has confirmed an illegal breach of @entity0 borders , the nationality of the vessel can not be confirmed armed and ready : prime minister @entity28 said @entity0 would defend its borders ' with all available means ' @entity24 said the military obtained evidence of the intrusion with its own sensors , and provided images of the seabed where trails left by the submarine could be seen			1
@entity28 noted that @entity0 's coastline is as long as the @entity141 @entity140 , making it difficult to monitor , but promised to strengthen the country 's ability to find and identify intruders			2
' let me say this , loud and clear , to those who are responsible : it is completely unacceptable , ' @entity28 said			0
the @entity151 country launched its biggest submarine hunt since the @entity153 on october 17 , after receiving eyewitness reports of ' underwater activity ' in the archipelago that extends from @entity4 into the @entity157			2
the week - long hunt has involved more than 200 troops , stealth ships and helicopters but the military called it off after concluding that the vessel had probably escaped into the @entity157			1
the military said then that it was likely that a foreign submarine or divers had been active in the archipelago , but fell short of concluding that there was absolute proof of an intrusion into @entity0 water			1
@entity0 built up an anti-submarine force after a @entity175 sub with nuclear weapons ran aground off its southern shores in 1981 , but started dismantling the force as part of deep cuts in defense spending after the @entity153 ended			0
anti-submarine helicopters were phased out in 2008 and replacements are not expected until 2018 .			0

foreign submarine violated @entity0 borders , government confirms
which country was behind illegal intrusion is still *unclear*
@entity9 media responded by claiming it was a @entity14 sub
comes after *initial* denial that breach had been made by submarine
more than 200 troops , ships and helicopters involved in hunt last month
several *sources* said at the time that the submarine was @entity9
