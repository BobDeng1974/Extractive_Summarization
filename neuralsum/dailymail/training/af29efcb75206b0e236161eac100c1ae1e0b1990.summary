by @entity1 reporter published : 04:02 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 1 july 2013 fake : the signs claimed there were checkpoints like this ahead			1
but instead there were just police checking for motorists ' reactions an @entity11 police department have come under fire for setting up fake checkpoints to search drivers and their cars for drugs			1
police in the city of @entity19 recently posted large yellow signs along @entity21 that warned drivers that there was a drug checkpoint ahead , to be prepared to stop and that there was a drug - sniffing police dog in use			1
there was no such checkpoint , just police officers waiting to see if any drivers would react suspiciously after seeing the signs			1
authorities say that four people were stopped , with some arrests and drugs seized			2
they declined to be more specific			0
the @entity38 in @entity19 reports that some civil rights leaders and at least one person pulled over by police are questioning the tactic , wondering if it could violate the @entity43 against unlawful searches and seizures			1
' i do n’t think it accomplishes any public safety goals , ' said @entity49 , a prominent @entity19 civil rights attorney			2
' i do n’t think it ’s good to mislead the population for any reason if you ’re a government agency			0
' @entity55 , a spokesman for the @entity19 office of the @entity57 , said his office will be looking further into the fake checkpoints to determine whether anyone ’s rights may be being violated			1
@entity62 , a @entity63 assistant prosecutor , said the fake checkpoints are legal and a legitimate effort in the war on drugs			2
' we should be applauded for doing this , ' @entity62 said			0
' it ’s a good thing			0
' a 2000 @entity72 @entity71 ruling said actual drug checkpoints are not legal and that police can randomly stop cars for just two reasons : to prevent immigrants without legal permission to be in the @entity72 and contraband from entering the country and to get drunk drivers off the road			1
no checkpoint : police in @entity19 posted signs along @entity21 that warned drivers that there was a drug checkpoint ahead , to be prepared to stop and that there was a drug - sniffing police dog in use			1
there was n't it ’s unclear how that ruling would apply to a fake drug checkpoint or whether any other police department in the nation has used similar tactics @entity99 , one of the four drivers pulled over as a result of the fake checkpoint , said he wonders if he was targeted because he has long , unkempt hair			1
@entity99 , of @entity104 , said he was driving on the interstate when he missed his exit			0
he pulled over to check his phone for directions , then pulled back onto the freeway when his phone disconnected from the charger , causing him to pull over again to reconnect it , he said			0
soon after returning to the freeway , police pulled him over			2
@entity99 said the officer asked him what kind of drugs he had in the car , saying it would be much easier to confess before other officers and a drug - sniffing dog arrived			1
@entity99 insisted he had no drugs			0
as promised , other officers and the dog were summoned , and @entity99 agreed to allow his car to be searched			2
' the last time i checked , it is not against the law to pull over to the side of the road to check directions , ' said @entity99 , who added that the officer who stopped him commended him for being safety conscious			0
' i see what they ’re doing , but i think it ’s kind of dangerous , ' @entity99 said			0
' it ’s one thing to do this on a 25 mph road ; it ’s another on a busy interstate			0
i think it ’s a violation to just be pulled over and searched			0

police in @entity19 posted large signs on i - *271* warning of checkpoint ahead
but no checkpoint existed , just officers looking for suspicious reactions
drug checkpoints are *illegal* in @entity72 but it is unclear if signs for fake ones are
