@entity5 took out £ 200 from a cash machine in order to buy @entity8 presents for her children , shortly before popping into a bar for a drink with friends			1
but a woman who saw her pull out the banknotes ambushed her in the toilet and brutally beat her , leaving her covered in blood			1
warning : graphic images attacked : @entity5 , 24 , was beaten up in a bar because she was carrying a wad of cash damage : the young mother had to go to hospital after the brutal and unprovoked attack on saturday the attacker took the 24 - year - old 's money , then went back to her friends at the bar and carried on drinking			1
ms @entity5 was helped out by another reveller , who took pictures of her horrific injuries before taking her to hospital after the attack at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
' i feel lucky to be alive as there must have been up to 40 blows to my head , ' said ms @entity5 , who has a six - year - old son and a daughter aged four			1

' i was left on the floor in a pool of blood			2

' a lady came and she went to get help and i was escorted out of the back of the club while [ the attacker ] was still drinking at the bar like nothing had happened			2
i ca n't believe someone could do that to another person			2
