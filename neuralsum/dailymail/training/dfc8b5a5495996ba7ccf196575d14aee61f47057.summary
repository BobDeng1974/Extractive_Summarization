looking back nearly two weeks on i am still stunned by the scale of @entity3 's fight against @entity4			1
the pressure on everyone involved was so big , but no one carried more than @entity3			2
the winner was always going to go on and become the biggest household name in @entity11 boxing and i always felt that despite everything @entity3 has achieved , he would be judged on that night			2
that ’s brutal but that ’s life			0
i went in to see him before the fight and i told him : ‘ you simply have to win because everything you have achieved will mean nothing if you do n’t			2
’ he said : ‘ i know , it 's unbelievable , eh ? ’ it ’s not fair , but what can you do ? the finish was stunning , the night was stunning			0
job done : @entity3 celebrates his win over @entity4 at @entity26 in may now we are looking at the next step for @entity3			1
there is no cast iron guarantee that @entity3 will fight again unless the opportunity is right			1
if the right fight does n't present itself there is a real possibility @entity3 will retire			1
there are three realistic options for opponents – a third fight with @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
i do n’t think @entity3 is in any rush to fight again and i do n’t think in his mind he is 100 per cent about coming back			2
it is all about the opportunity			0
a fight in @entity48 is what he really wants to do and @entity50 would be the most realistic fight to happen in @entity48			1
it is not necessarily ' vegas or nothing ' , but all the noises from @entity3 are that he has done almost everything and what could possibly follow @entity26 ? ‘ what can get me motivated like i was for that fight ? ’ is how he looks at it			2
i had a meeting with @entity40 last week , i am meeting @entity62 on wednesday and on tuesday i spoke to @entity63 about @entity50 and @entity48			1
like i said and @entity3 has said many times , he wants to fight in @entity48			1
i think he wants @entity50 more , but there is always a case for big domestic fights and he likes going to war with @entity39			1
they like punching each other			0
if @entity40 or @entity39 could be made in @entity48 then @entity3 would consider those as well , but being realistic @entity50 is the @entity48 fight and i know it would sell			1
write caption here the big one : @entity3 would rather fight @entity41 ( left ) in @entity48 we now need to look into the demand , appetite and money for all our options			1
@entity40 is an interesting case because he is the @entity81 mandatory challenger , but @entity3 does n’t have to fight him until february			2
it ’s feasible that @entity3 will fight someone else this time and then come back to @entity85 in @entity86			1
it is also possible that @entity3 will take a break and come back next @entity86 , but if he comes back this year it is likely to be at the end of november			2
he wants @entity48 and that is what i am working on			2
from one world title fight to another			1
we have agreed terms with @entity97 for @entity98 to fight @entity99 on august 9 at the @entity100 in @entity101			1
i have been quite vocal on @entity102 in not announcing fights until contracts are signed			0
the process is simple – you agree terms and then you proceed to contracts			0
that is where we are at in this moment			0
we expect to execute those contracts within the next 24 hours			0
i do n’t see any issues coming up			0
we tried everything we could to get @entity99 to the @entity11 but there was zero interest from their team			0
we are very happy with the deal , though , and @entity98 is in fantastic shape			0
he has been training since march , when he had his last fight , and his weight is perfect			0
he is absolutely firing on all cylinders			0
i can not see anything else other than a stoppage win for @entity98			2
done deal : @entity98 ( right ) is down to fight @entity99 on august 9 at the @entity100 in @entity101 no trip : @entity99 ( here knocking down @entity128 ) did n't have any interest in a fight over in @entity131 it is a big shout – @entity99 is a great talent			1
but let ’s break it down			0
@entity99 ’s win over @entity137 to win the @entity81 title was impressive , but @entity137 was inactive			1
then there was the performance against @entity128 , which was impressive but how much does @entity128 have left ? @entity99 also drew with @entity141 , and went the distance with @entity143			0
@entity99 is certainly not superman			0
i am confident that if he mauls forward and tries to fight like he did against @entity128 , then he will walk on to one against @entity98			2
when he hits you , you know about it			0
a deal will be done on wednesday or thursday and then @entity98 will have the fight he wants so badly			2
i was so happy to see @entity150 become a two - time world champion on @entity3 ’s undercard			1
he has had a horrible 12 months , having his @entity81 world title stripped because of politics , but he has the @entity156 world bantamweight title and we are now planning his next move			1
who next ? we saw @entity160 beat @entity161 to take @entity150 ’s old @entity81 belt and now we have the prospect of two @entity11 fighters in a unification fight			1
@entity166 , @entity167 ’s promoter , says he has made an offer , but neither @entity150 nor i have received an offer			0
just champion : @entity150 became a two - time world title holder at @entity26 next up ? @entity150 could face @entity160 ( right ) in a unification fight that said , it is a fight we would love to make			1
we have sent a written offer to @entity160 's team for a huge purse of £ 200,000			1
if @entity166 wants to beat that offer , then we will certainly consider it			0
we do n’t want to play games , let ’s make this fight			0
@entity184 is fighting for a world title this weekend against @entity186 in @entity101			1
this is a huge opportunity for @entity184			2
he has been out there for a couple of weeks and is living the dream			0
there are question marks over whether he can do it at this level , but he is a mandatory challenger and has earned the right to this shot			0
he is very confident and we all believe he can do it , but this is a tough , tough job			0
i am going to @entity101 on wednesday where i have a series of meetings lined up with @entity97 , @entity204 , @entity205 etc to discuss all sorts of things			0
i am discussing @entity99 against @entity208 , @entity3 and @entity50 , the possibility of @entity210 against @entity211 for the @entity81 lightweight title , and the possibility of @entity214 against @entity215 for the @entity81 featherweight title			1
a @entity219 win would make this an incredible trip			0
the big one : @entity184 ( right ) is fighting for a world title this weekend against @entity186 in @entity101			1

@entity3 will retire if he does n't get the right opportunity
talks have started with @entity85 , @entity39 and @entity50 , but @entity50 in @entity48 is what @entity3 wants
why i **'m** convinced @entity98 will knock out @entity99
i have offered @entity160 £ 200,000 to fight @entity150 in a unification fight
i **'m** off to @entity101 to watch @entity184 win a world title
