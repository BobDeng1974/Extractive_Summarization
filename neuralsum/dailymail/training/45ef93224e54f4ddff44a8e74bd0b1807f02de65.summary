by @entity0 published : 04:37 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 8 october 2013 the new $ 100 bill , with an array of high - tech features designed to thwart counterfeiters , will get its coming out party today after being plagued by printing problems			1
@entity7 remains as the face of the bill , but he is joined by a new changing colour ink well and bell and a 3d security ribbon			1
the new design bills were previously scheduled to be launched in the @entity14 in february 2011 , but the @entity15 first hit has been set back with printing and quality control issues since 2010			1
there was later a problem with ink smearing that further delayed introduction of the new notes			0
then earlier this year , a ' mashing ' issue - when too much ink is applied making it impossible to create crisp lines - resulted in at least 30 million $ 100 bills being destroyed			1
the problem occurred at one of three printing factories and set back issuance of the new design by several more months			2
but officials say the problems have now been fixed			0
@entity44 , deputy associate director at @entity45 , said in a video statement that ' issuance was delayed until the @entity15 resolved some unexpected production challenges			0
' @entity49 , the director of the @entity15 said the bureau is now confident it has resolved the various production issues			2
today , the @entity52 will transport the highest value @entity14 currency in armored trucks from its regional banks around the country headed to banks , savings and loans and other financial institutions with the new notes			1
being rolled out : americans could get their hands on a new bill as early as tomorrow			0
the government reminds people their existing $ 100 notes will remain usable some bank customers could start seeing the new bills , which took a decade to redesign , by tuesday afternoon depending on how close their bank is to a regional @entity52 facility			1
' we have 3.5 billion of these notes which we think will be more than ample to meet domestic and international demands , ' said @entity76 , program manager for @entity14 currency education at the @entity52 the bill redesign , the first for the $ 100 bill since march 1996 , will still have @entity7 on the front and @entity83 's @entity82 on the back			1
in addition , there is a disappearing @entity88 in an ink well and a bright blue three - dimensional security ribbon with images that move in the opposite direction from the way the bill is being tilted			2
the number 100 also shifts from copper to green			0
' the 3 - d security ribbon is magic			0
it is made up of hundreds of thousands of micro-lenses in each note , ' said mr @entity49 , the director of the @entity15			0
' this is the most complex note the @entity14 has ever produced			2
' improvements : compared with the existing $ 100 bills , there is an additional blue ribbon , a changing colour @entity88 , and tiny inscriptions along @entity7 's collar the $ 100 bill is the last bill to get a make - over in a process that began in 2003 with the $ 20 bill			1
the government redesigned the greenbacks with subtle colours and other security features to make it harder for counterfeiters			0
the $ 100 bill , which is the most commonly counterfeited note outside of the @entity14 , was redesigned with even more complex security features			1
officials stressed that the $ 900 billion worth of $ 100 bills currently in circulation will remain good and will only be gradually phased out as worn - out bills are returned to @entity52 facilities			1
the $ 100 bill is the largest @entity14 denomination in circulation and has the longest life at 15 years			2
the $ 1 bill lasts 5.9 years			0
the new $ 100 bills will have one old feature			2
the signature on the bills will be that of former treasury secretary @entity139			0
