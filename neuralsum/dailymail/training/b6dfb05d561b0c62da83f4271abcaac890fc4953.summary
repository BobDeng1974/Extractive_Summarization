once seen widely as a currency attracting criminals , its reputation is now soaring - not to mention its price			1
but users have reported several alarming recent thefts of @entity6 , the digital currency taking the world by storm			2
invented in 2009 , the global currency 's anonymity and lack of control from any government makes it ideal for digital entrepreneurs , but also a prime target for hackers			1
vulnerable : real - world bitcoins pictured in april			1
hackers have attacked sites hosting the digital currency in the most recent attack hackers stole 1,295 bitcoins worth more than $ 1 million from one of the world 's biggest sites , the @entity24 news site reported			1
the criminals attacked the servers of the @entity33 - based @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , wiping its data			1
they weakened the site by launching a catastrophic denial of service attack - where a server is bombarded with data until it collapses - before stealing the virtual currency			1
chief executive @entity42 said the attackers may have been from @entity44 and neighbouring countries , @entity24 reported			0
he wrote on the @entity46 : ' please be advised that attacks are not isolated to us and if you are storing larger amounts of coins with any third party you may want to find alternative storage solutions as soon as possible			2
' soaring : the value of @entity6 in dollars has more than quadrupled in november			0
source : @entity56 security breach : @entity42 , chief executive of the @entity59 , said his site suffered a catastrophic hacking attack			0
he added : ' several consumer wallets have been compromised ' a statement on the firm 's website said : ' @entity32 has been a target of a coordinated attack and subsequent security breached			0
several consumer wallets have been compromised and @entity32 will be contacting the affected users			0
' as a consequence @entity32 will temporarily close down the wallet initiative to focus on real - time merchant processing business which does not include storing of @entity6			1
suddenly the world is fascinated with @entity6 - which has soared in value since the start of november			2
it is currently worth about $ 1,100 per coin and yesterday one coin was worth more than an ounce of gold for the first time , it 's claimed			1
and it is hitting ' real life ' , with a cash machine in @entity88 , @entity89 , and a sushi restaurant in @entity91 dispensing and accepting the currency			1
the virtual money - whose value is determined by no government , instead by a peer - to - peer network of mainly anonymous users - was invented by @entity99 in 2009			1
but that is not his real name - he , too , was anonymous			1
the inventor released the coding for his currency in open - source form , and users can now create their own bitcoins			2
it happens through a process called mining , which forces computers to solve algorithms so complex that the amount of power they take up limits how much currency can flood the market			2
its value works just like any undefinable commodity , with the same potential pitfalls			0
in one of the most famous price bubbles , tulips took on enormous value in 17th @entity126 with lovers of the flowers remortgaging their houses - before the price suddenly collapsed			2
' @entity32 will consider to reintroduce the wallet initiative with a re-architected security model			0
' angry users of the currency took to forums to protest at the loss of their money , including an anonymous user who lost 90 bitcoins ( about $ 100,000 )			2
the user said people who were affected should file a class - action lawsuit			0
he admitted @entity6 was the ' wild west ' of currency but said : ' i think it 's reasonable , fair , and legal for the affected individuals to get together and try to negotiate as a group for some kind of compensation			0
' meanwhile @entity151 website bitcash.cz had its entire balance stolen - which last month was estimated at about $ 100,000			1
a statement on the firm 's website said : ' on november 11 , in the evening , there was a security breach on our server			0
' the unknown attacker managed to convert the entire ... balances in users ' wallets			0
' it also comes after @entity167 site @entity165 claimed $ 1.3 million of @entity6 were stolen three weeks ago - just as the currency 's value began soaring			1
several sites which have fallen victim to the hackers , including @entity165 , have been forced to deny accusations of an ' inside job '			0
such was the case with the @entity177 website @entity178 , which put a long statement on its website last week			2
it said : ' it is understood that in this situation you expect a detailed explanation , but we can not make public information such as what data has been lost , what has been recovered , at what stage the proceedings [ are ] because it will harm the investigation			0
' your speculation , allusions and often accusations directly , not having the slightest basis in reality and posted on the forum are very hurtful , bring chaos and anxiety , as well as damage [ our ] image			0
' we understand your bitterness , but please refrain from drawing conclusions and issuing extrajudicial [ action ] until the end of proceedings			0
' global : @entity208 , a restaurant in @entity91 , has begun accepting @entity6 despite the controversy meanwhile in a separate issue , an entrepreneur who makes physical bitcoins - @entity212 , from @entity214 , @entity215 - suspended all new orders on thursday over unspecified ' regulatory issues '			1
a statement on his blog said : ' for the time being , i have suspended accepting new orders , pending resolution of some concerns i have as to regulatory issues			1
' i am anticipating a possibility of having to prequalify buyers , and am holding off taking orders until i know for sure			0

more than $ *2m* stolen from @entity33 , @entity177 , @entity151 and @entity167 sites
man who makes real - life coins also halts orders amid ' regulatory issues '
virtual currency was worth more than gold for the first time yesterday
