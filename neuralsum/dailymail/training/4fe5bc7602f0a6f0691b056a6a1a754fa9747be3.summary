since march 2011 , around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire in protest against the @entity4 occupation of @entity5 by @entity6 published : 10:44 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 12:37 est , 5 december 2012 martyr : @entity8 betrays nothing in this picture of her plan to set herself on fire in the name of home and country peering thoughtfully into the camera , her mouth curved into the faintest of smiles , 17 - year - old @entity8 looks the picture of youthful promise			1
but by the time she took this photograph in the darkness of her bedroom , her plans were already in motion to travel to a @entity4 government office building in eastern @entity5 , douse herself in petrol and light a match			1
the only clue to her final act are the haunting words , scrawled roughly on her hand in @entity40 script : ' @entity5 is an independent nation '			1
by then she knew this act of self - immolation would be her last , so she left a will in an envelope , alongside this picture , written in the form of a poem			0
at the head of the note , she wrote : ' beloved children of the @entity52 , sons and daughters of the @entity54 , warriors of the snow mountain , do n’t forget your are @entity40			1
' she became the latest of a string of young @entity40 to set fire to themselves in the name of independence when she took her life in a ball of flame on november 26			1
since march 2011 , around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire in protest against the @entity4 occupation of @entity5			1
there were 25 in november alone , according to campaigners			0
this wave of self - immolations reveal the desperation among @entity5 's youth after 60 years under @entity76 's thumb and underlie a harsh crackdown in recent years by the @entity4 government any who dare question its sovereignty over the mountain nation			1
until her tragic and violent death , @entity8 had been a nun at the @entity86 near the @entity87			0
she left a note with the picture , in @entity40 script , which included the words : ' look up , @entity40 , look at the snow mountains			1
the snowland ’s era has begun			0
and @entity5 is free and independent ' there she would have been well schooled in @entity98 teachings , in particular its emphasis on non-violence , even in the face of conflict			2
indeed , the first of the five precepts that all @entity106 should follow is ' avoid killing , or harming any living thing '			0
her death serves as a stark reminder of the passion that fuels this spate of self immolations and the lengths young people in @entity5 are prepared to go in order to raise awareness of their region 's plight			2
she goes on with a call to arms to her countrymen to join her fight for a free @entity5			1
@entity8 's name joins a rapidly growing list of young @entity40 so angry at their @entity4 rulers that they are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to draw the world 's attention to their region 's plight			1
self immolations in @entity5 have become so common that they happen on an almost daily basis			0
already since @entity8 's death , on november 26 , nine @entity40 have followed suit as calls for an independent @entity5 continued to echo throughout the world , according to campaign group @entity140			1
in november , 25 protesters - aged between 15 and 30 - set themselves on fire , following ten such cases in october			0
and on sunday , 17 - year - old @entity145 , set himself on fire near the @entity147 in @entity148			0
he is believed to have survived and was taken away by @entity4 police			0
the first stanza reads : ' look up , fellow @entity40 , look at the blue twilight above , like a heavenly tent of white mountain , my lama has returned			2
' in the fourth stanza , goes on : ' look up , @entity40 , look at the snow mountains			2
the snowland ’s era has begun			0
and @entity5 is free and independent			2
' in the two closing stanzas , she pays tribute to the @entity163 and the @entity164 , who has been missing since 1995 , spirited away by the @entity4 government at the age of six after he was officially named the reincarnation of the @entity168			1
' @entity169 , when he lived far away , he travelled around the world , praying for the end of suffering of the red - faced @entity40 , and released us from darkness , at a time when @entity164 is in prison , he looks out from his prison cell , prays for " the dawn of peace and happiness in my land of snow "			2
' she becomes the sixth person to set herself on fire in @entity5 in as many weeks			2
the @entity4 government has sought to crack down on @entity40 dissidents issuing a stern warning to the authorities of eastern @entity5 to punish all self - immolators and their relatives - and even those who send condolences to bereaved families			1
it said all government aid would be removed from the families of self - immolators while development projects in communities that have been home to such protesters would be cancelled			0
the charity and campaign group @entity140 says it has documented multiple cases of collective punishment , imposed against the communities and families were individuals have set themselves on fire , or were other forms of protest have taken place			0
it says punishments have included homes being ransacked , development projects which were planned for a village cancelled and ‘ public criticism ’			0
of the 90 protesters who have set themselves on fire , the majority have died of their injuries			0
those who survive , are arrested and taken away			0
they are rarely seen again , say campaign groups			0
@entity221 , director of @entity5 , said : ' tibetans from all walks of life , young and old , mothers , nomads , students , monks and nuns are rejecting @entity4 ’s occupation of their homeland			1
burning issue : since march 2011 , around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire in protest against the @entity4 occupation of @entity5			1
in march this year , @entity40 exile @entity237 , 27 , set himself on fire during a protest in @entity240 @entity5 's spiritual leaders : @entity8 paid tribute to the @entity163 , left , and the @entity164 , right , who has been missing since 1995 since he was named the reincarnation of the @entity168 aged six ' warriors of the snow mountain ' : @entity246 as seen from the @entity247 in @entity5 , @entity4			1
in her poem , @entity8 urges @entity40 to ' look up at the snow mountains ... the snowland 's era has begun ... @entity5 is free and independent ' ' @entity4 is trying to crush protest through arbitrary detention , collective punishment , communications blackouts , bribery and much more – this has only strengthened the resolve of the @entity40 people in their struggle for freedom			1
' @entity5 is receiving reports of protests inside @entity5 on an almost daily basis			0
these protests will only continue until each and everyone one of us stands with the @entity40 people in their struggle for freedom and our governments stop kowtowing to an unelected @entity4 regime			1
' but it is also a moral and policy dilemma for @entity5 's spiritual leader , the @entity163 , and a new generation of exiled politicians			2
the @entity163 fled to @entity279 in 1959 with hundreds of followers and they set up base in @entity282 , a town in the @entity284 foothills about 400 km ( 250 miles ) north of @entity240			0
the deaths raise theological questions about non-violence and highlight a long - standing schism between the elderly @entity163 's softly , softly approach to @entity4 and activists who want to fight for independence .			2

days after photo was taken , @entity8 went to a @entity4 government building , in eastern @entity5 , doused herself in petrol and light a match
in a note she wrote the words : ' @entity301 , warriors of the snow mountain , do *n't* forget your are @entity40 '
it is accompanied by a poem in praise of the @entity163 and a free @entity5
since march 2011 , around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire in protest against the @entity4 occupation of @entity5
