@entity1 believe an @entity3 return for @entity4 next summer will prove almost impossible , it emerged on friday			1
united supporters are praying their former hero comes back from @entity8 to end his career with them next summer			0
however senior @entity3 sources told @entity11 that they believe the cost of bringing the @entity14 back to the club will in all likelihood prove prohibitive for a player who will be halfway towards his 31st birthday by the start of next season			1
add a transfer fee of about £ 60m to that and the cost of the deal becomes clear			2
a @entity1 source said today : ' @entity4 will always be loved here			1
' but if you look at the numbers and his age than you have to ask if it really could be made to work			0
' we are not at all sure it can			0
' @entity4 made his name at @entity1 , signing in 2003 before moving to @entity8 six years later @entity4 celebrates winning the 2008 @entity46 in @entity47 with sir @entity48 @entity50 return to @entity1 could cost £ 60m matches : 290 ( 2003 - 09 ) goals : 117 honours : 3 x @entity54 1 x @entity56 , 2 x @entity57 1 x @entity46 1 x @entity59 @entity1 believe that their best chance of buying @entity4 back was actually last summer when he made it clear to them that he was unhappy with life at @entity8			1
club insiders believe that had former manager sir @entity48 been in charge then the deal may well have happened			0
a new @entity1 team would then have been built around him			0
as it was , @entity69 was in the first stages of his own short reign at that point and ultimately @entity1 believe they were led on by the @entity4 camp as he tried to engineer a new contract at the @entity76			1
the @entity32 forward celebrates scoring for @entity8 in the @entity46 this week ironically , it is that deal – eventually signed last september – that now makes it so difficult to bring @entity4 back to the club where he first came to the world ’s attention			2
with @entity4 contracted now until 2018 , @entity8 president @entity83 holds all the cards in terms of dictating a fee for the club ’s prize asset			2
