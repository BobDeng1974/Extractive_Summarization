but when it came to a wandering hedgehog , @entity6 's opening batsman was left completely stumped			1
@entity1 , 38 , found himself having to call out rescue workers to cut through the entrance to his garden after a prickly intruder got stuck there			1
the female hedgehog was given a clean bill of health before being released back into the cricketer ’s garden in @entity35 , @entity6			1
@entity1 praised the efforts of staff at @entity38 in nearby @entity39 , which is holding a hedgehog open weekend this saturday and sunday			2
he said : ' it was a bit different holding a prickly ball rather than a cricket ball			0
hedgehogs in t'pitch : the @entity6 cricketer called in the help @entity48 to come to the aid of the prickly , yet surprisingly portly animal 56913 26703 143523 112617 36433 38267 48018 30860 32601 bowled over : @entity1 watches as animal experts from @entity52 in @entity6 free a hedgehog which got stuck in the gates of his house ' my wife and family were delighted with the fast response from @entity52 and hope their forthcoming weekend is a huge success			1
' the drama began last week when @entity1 and his wife woke up to find the hedgehog wedged in the lower rungs of their front gates			1
after failing to prise the animal free he called in @entity52 and gave them permission to cut through the gates			2
@entity52 founder @entity72 said : ' hedgehogs are renowned for getting themselves into prickly situations like this			0
' we are delighted that on this occasion the hedgehog was able to be returned back into mr @entity1 ’s garden			2
' he was a part of the rescue mission too			0
he held her back whilst we were cutting through the bars			0
' he was then able to let the hedgehog go at night as we are pretty sure she had babies in the garden somewhere			0
' he says he has n’t seen her since			0
that is definitely the first time we have had to cut through someone ’s gates to free a hedgehog - they do love squeezing into tiny gaps though			2
' we were very lucky that @entity1 was so understanding in letting us cut the gates , we welded them back together for him			0
