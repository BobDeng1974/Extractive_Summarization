government insiders have likened the @entity4 battle to the @entity9 book and film , in which 24 people are pitched into a battle to the death insiders said a ‘ battle to the death ’ reminiscent of the film the @entity9 has erupted in @entity16 , as ministers try to off - load some of their costs by reclassifying them into areas with rising budgets			1
it is a reference to the futuristic sci - fi book and film , starring @entity37 , in which 24 people are pitched into a battle to the death			1
@entity40 today signalled that some defence spending could be shifted into the foreign aid budget to ease financial pressures on the armed forces			1
food , health and education programmes could also be moved into the @entity49 , the prime minister hinted			1
he said it was ‘ right to ask the question about what does development actually consist of ’			2
he told @entity55 : ‘ of course there are vaccination programmes , there ’s helping the poorest people in our world to grow food programmes , there ’s helping people go to school programmes			1
‘ but there is an argument that one of the most fundamental parts of development is security ; you do n’t get development without peace and security			0
’ @entity40 hinted that spending from some unprotected areas could be shifted into the protected foreign aid budget mr @entity40 yesterday admonished defence secretary @entity79 for leaking details of @entity82 plans to grab £ 200 million from the @entity83 and another £ 120 million from the school ’s budget to pay for private schooling for the children of servicemen			1
at a @entity91 political cabinet yesterday morning , the prime minister called on ministers to ‘ keep their thoughts to themselves ’			0
the future of the @entity97 budget has now become a bitter battleground			0

‘ it ’s a battle to the death , like something from the @entity9			0
’ health secretary @entity114 is refusing to accept any cuts to his budget			1
he will remind the prime minister that ringfencing the @entity97 budget was his personal pledge to voters and argue that great harm will come to the @entity91 brand if he backtracks			0
‘ we will be arguing for the retention of the ringfence , ’ a @entity124 source said			0
‘ this was a pledge the prime minister made in opposition			0
it was a big call to make and it has proved to be right			0
‘ demand is rising by 4 per cent a year in the @entity97 and having the budget means we can just about meet the requirements and plan ahead			2
there is a very strong case for maintaining the ringfence			0
it would undo much of the good work of the original pledge			0
’ he seems to have an ally in mr @entity106 , who defended the controversial decision to protect spending on foreign aid and the @entity97			1
‘ we ’ve decided we ’re sticking with the protected departments , ’ he said			2
‘ now the unprotected departments are being weighed up to see what savings they can yield			1
