by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 15 march 2013 a desperate family is appealing for help raising the £ 200,000 needed to allow their son to have last - chance cancer treatment in the @entity6 @entity7 , 16 , was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour when he was just nine - years - old			1
however , tests earlier this month revealed that the tumour has now started to grow , meaning his only chance is specialist radiation treatment only available in the @entity6 the treatment is not yet available in the @entity14 so the family , from @entity16 , @entity17 , is waiting to find out whether the @entity18 will pay for @entity7 to be treated abroad			1
@entity7 ( right ) is pictured with his brother @entity19 , 13 , ( left ) and parents , @entity21 and @entity22			2
@entity23 has pledged to dedicate his life to charity if @entity7 's fundraising appeal is successful @entity7 ( pictured in 2006 ) has been battling the cancer since he was nine if their application is refused , they will have to find between £ 100,000 and £ 200,000 to pay for the proton beam therapy themselves			1
@entity7 ’s father has pledged to dedicate the rest of his life to helping other children in similar positions if his appeal is successful			1
writing on his son ’s @entity38 fundraising page , @entity23 , said : ‘ the time for personal pride and ego has passed			0
i am hoping that by reaching out to you all , you might be able to support us in trying to offer @entity7 a future that ’s as normal as possible			1
‘ @entity7 is going to get the best treatment there is to give him a future			1
that is not in question			0
how we make it happen is the challenge			0
‘ we ’re currently all still reeling from the scale of the news we ’ve received but we do n’t have the luxury of time to waste			0
we have to act now			0
‘ if this appeal works , i ’m prepared to dedicate the rest of my life to helping other children in similar positions			1
‘ we have to make this work for @entity7 and we 've got just over two months to find the money			2
’ until his diagnosis seven years ago , @entity7 was a perfectly healthy nine - year - old			0
@entity7 ( pictured on his 11th birthday in january 2008 ) is to sit his gcses this summer however , his family was then given the devastating news that he had a brain tumour			1
the tumour itself is one of the less dangerous types that can often be treated very successfully with surgery			0
however , @entity7 was unlucky			0
his tumour is in one of the worst possible places - on his midbrain at the top of his brain stem - making even partial removal impossible without catastrophic consequences			0
mr @entity7 , 44 , explained that during the past seven years , @entity7 has been fighting his condition daily , enduring many surgical procedures , infections , countless blood transfusions and even post-operative meningitis as well as the permanent effects of the tumour			2
he explains that his son also endured a two year course of chemotherapy which successfully slowed the progression of the tumour			0
mr @entity7 wrote : ‘ there are some lasting side effects of his condition and from the cruel chemotherapy regime , but due to his personal strength , @entity7 brushes those aside and battles on with his life , thriving in school and making the most of every day			2
‘ @entity7 has a close circle of friends who are very supportive , helping him live a full and varied life			2
he studies hard and is looking forward to successful gcse results this summer			0
‘ he 's doing really well and is on course for getting @entity110			0
’ @entity7 's best chance of a normal future is proton beam therapy in the @entity6 he is pictured here ( left ) with his mother , @entity22 , and his brother , @entity19 however , recent scans have shown that the tumour has become more active and that there are large cysts developing around it			1
@entity7 ’s doctors have recommended that he has radiation treatment but the family are torn as there are potentially severe side effects			1
the treatment has a good chance of being able to render @entity7 ’s tumour dormant and may result in no further treatment for that tumour – ever			1
however , because of where @entity7 ’s tumour is , radiation treatment is very dangerous			1
healthy parts of his brain would be exposed harmful radiation			0
mr @entity7 explained that this could affect everything from his vision to his hearing , motor function and memory			0
on top of this , the tumour is near @entity7 ’s pituitary gland and if this is damaged he could suffer problems with growth , thyroid function , metabolism , sex hormones and blood pressure			2
however , in the @entity6 a more advanced treatment – known as proton beam therapy – is available			1
it allows the radiation to be targeted directly at the tumour meaning that healthy surrounding tissue is not damaged			0
@entity7 ’s family believe that this is the best option for him			2
