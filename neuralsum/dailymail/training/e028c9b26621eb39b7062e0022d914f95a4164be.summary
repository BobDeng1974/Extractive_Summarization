plans for a massive new @entity2 development which would feature an @entity4 theatre and gondola tram have sparked a bitter land dispute			1
the proposed project would be built on the eastern rim of the @entity10 canyon on an untouched plateau and would be linked down to the canyon floor by the tram			1
the site for the proposed development is called ' the confluence ' and is where the @entity17 meets the @entity19 on the canyon 's east side - and according to the @entity22 creation story , is the spot where their people first emerged			1
developers @entity27 want to provide visitors to the @entity30 with a new 420 - acre attraction ( pictured ) which would feature an @entity4 theatre , shops , hotels and a gondola tram but now developers @entity27 want to create a new 420 - acre multimedia complex complete with @entity4 theater , shops , hotels , an rv park and gondola tram which would ferry visitors the 1.6 miles to the canyon floor in just 10 minutes			1
the @entity30 attracts more than five million tourists every year			0
but it is also spiritually significant to the @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity22 tribes			1
@entity51 , a member of the @entity52 , said : ' it is my church , it is where i say my prayers			2
it is where i give my offerings			0
it 's where i commune with the holy ones , the gods that walk along the canyon , ' she told @entity69			0
the developers have also outlined plans for a ' @entity72 ' on the canyon floor which would include walkways , restaurants , a tramway station , toilets , a terraced seating area and a wastewater package plant			0
@entity80 said the confluence is the ' final spiritual resting place ' for @entity48 ancestors , and building the project ' would severely compromise access and our ability to practice religion ' on the site those supporting the project argue it will allow tourists to see the canyon in a different way			2
at the moment the shortest path down to the canyon floor is seven miles of scrub path - the proposed gondola would make the trip just 10 minutes			2
the @entity101 has said the @entity2 is ' in danger ' under the project and @entity30 superintendent @entity103 branded the plans ' a travesty '			2
but @entity52 president @entity106 said he will support the project and the $ 65 million required from the tribe for road , water and communication facilities			1
he said he sees the plans as an ' opportunity ' for the @entity22			2
' i want my people to have a better life			0
i want them to have jobs , they need homes , good homes			0
they need better education , ' he told @entity69			0
when mr @entity106 was asked about those @entity22 tribal members who do not want the development he said : ' some of them want to go back to the old ways			1
but you ca n't go back			0
' @entity128 ( pictured ) a member of the @entity52 , opposes plans to develop on the sacred site mr @entity106 added the @entity22 suffer from high unemployment and suicide rates			1
business opportunities on the land are scarce because for 40 years development on 1.6 million acres of tribal land was halted by the government under ' @entity139 '			0
it was intended to prevent both the @entity48 and @entity22 tribes from building on the land , because the tribes disputed its ownership			1
members of the @entity48 tribe are opposing the project and have said the proposed development is too close to one of their sacred sites , the @entity150			1
@entity80 , director for the @entity48 's @entity151 , said the confluence is the ' final spiritual resting place ' for @entity48 ancestors , and building a tourist destination ' would severely compromise access and our ability to practice religion ' on the site			2
but @entity22 @entity161 , one of @entity27 ' developers , argues the project will allow his tribe to profit from their land while giving visitors to the area a breathtaking view			2
he claims the tribe could receive up to 18 percent of gross revenue from the development			0
mr @entity106 is expected to sign a proposed resolution authorizing the project soon , and developers hope to begin the project as early as the spring of 2017 - but tribe members say they will not stop opposing the development			1
they have founded a group called ' save the @entity27 ' and are spreading their message with stickers and painted signs across the @entity22 reservation			0
mr @entity80 said : ' these landscapes and the canyon and the confluence today are still very , very important to the @entity48 people and we 'll never let that go			0
' we 're not going to give up on being good stewards of these lands			0
' the @entity101 said the @entity2 ( pictured ) is ' in danger ' under the proposed project			1

proposed project would build 420 - acre multimedia complex on plateau
development would include *cinema* , shops , hotels and gondola tram
but @entity2 site is spiritually significant to @entity22 and @entity48 tribes
@entity52 president @entity106 has said he will support the project
but tribal members and authorities say the complex would be a ' travesty '
the holy site is considered sacred to both the @entity22 and @entity48 tribes
