by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:46 est , 3 december 2013 bird beaks were thought to have evolved since the dinosaurs to replace teeth , but new fossil findings suggest beaks are much older			1
beaks are a typical hallmark of modern birds and can be found in a huge variety of forms and shapes to cope with the environment and food sources			1
for example a hummingbird has along thin beak to get at flower nectar while others such as parrots evolved to be able to crack nuts and fruit seeds			0
a study led by the @entity25 has found that dinosaur beaks evolved for eating prior to their role in aiding flight			1
pictured is the original fossil of @entity32 ( back ) and life reconstruction ( front ) depicting the animal with a keratinous beak however the new study by the @entity25 has shed light on the functional importance of dinosaur beaks			1
less well known was that keratin - covered beaks had already evolved in different groups of dinosaurs during the @entity44			1
employing high - resolution ct scanning and computer simulations scientists used digital models to take a closer look at these dinosaur beaks			0
computer models of the skull of @entity32 show it without ( left ) and with a keratinous beak ( right )			1
colour plots on this image reveal the degree of deformation in the different skull configurations @entity32 was a large herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur , which lived more than 90 million years ago during the @entity44 in what is now @entity61			2
in 1980 , @entity62 named @entity32 after the @entity63 from @entity61 mythology			0
these dinosaurs , which may have been feathered , were fairly large and had long , sharp hand claws			0
the snout of the 10 - to 13 - foot - long ( 3 - to 4 - metre - long ) therizinosaur is thought to have been partly covered with a keratinous beak			0
these beaks may have developed to improve stability of the skull while the dinosaur was feeding			0
the focus of the study was the skull of @entity32 , a 10 - 13ft large herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur , which lived more than 90 million years ago during the @entity44 in what is now @entity61			2
the dinosaur showed evidence that part of its snout was covered by a keratinous beak			0
the study reveals that keratinous beaks played an important role in stabilising the skeletal structure during feeding , making the skull less susceptible to bending and deformation			2
dr @entity92 of @entity93 of @entity94 said : ' it has classically been assumed that beaks evolved to replace teeth and thus save weight , as a requirement for the evolution of flight			1
' our results , however , indicate that keratin beaks were in fact beneficial to enhance the stability of the skull during biting and feeding			2
' @entity32 was a large herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur , which lived more than 90 million years ago during the @entity44 in what is now @entity61 dr @entity109 a reader of @entity111 added : ' using @entity112 , a computer modelling technique routinely used in engineering , we were able to deduce very accurately how bite and muscle forces affected the skull of @entity32 during the feeding process			0
' this further allowed us to identify the importance of soft - tissue structures , such as the keratinous beak , which are normally not preserved in fossils			0
' ' beaks evolved several times during the transitions from dinosaurs to modern birds , usually accompanied by the partial or complete loss of teeth and our study now shows that keratin - covered beaks represent a functional innovation during dinosaur evolution , ' said professor @entity135 of @entity136 .			1

snout of the @entity32 was found to be covered with keratin
keratin is a tough material found in the beaks and claws of birds
scientists believe the presence of keratin made the skull less likely to bend
this suggests beaks evolved for eating prior to their role in aiding flight
