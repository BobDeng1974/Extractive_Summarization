the cash bonanza from the @entity2 ’s new tv deals is going where everyone expected - the players ’ pockets - with experts @entity6 saying the total wage bills for the 20 clubs rose over £ 2billion last season			1
when costs for non-playing staff are removed that works out at something likely to be slightly more than £ 2.5m per season per man			0
and as the rich get richer , the gap to the rest of football has got bigger , with @entity20 clubs suffering a double whammy of lower income and higher wage costs at the same time , meaning bigger losses			1
the top of the tree : @entity27 won the @entity2 title after a hard - fought campaign @entity6 ’s annual report considers in detail the season for which full financial accounts are all available , the 2012 - 13 campaign , but crucially also forecasts what has happened in the season just finished			2
@entity2 income for all clubs combined grew to £ 2.5bn in 2012 - 13 and that will have leapt to £ 3.2bn by 2013 - 14 , @entity6 say , thanks to the new 2013 - 16 tv deals with @entity43 and @entity45 sport			2
wage costs were £ 1.8bn in 2012 - 13 , or almost 72 per cent of income , and these are believed to have jumped a massive 22 per cent to £ 2.2bn in 2013 - 14			1
high earner : @entity50 penned a new deal with @entity52 in february worth a staggering £ 300,000 - a - week on @entity20 clubs , the report says : ' the 2012/13 season was a particularly bleak year for the finances of @entity20 clubs			0
a revenue reduction of £ 39m was compounded by a £ 40m increase in wage costs , leading to record operating losses of £ 241m			0
pre-tax losses also increased by £ 170m , equivalent to an additional £ 7m per club , to £ 323m			0
@entity64 , senior consultant in the @entity65 at @entity6 , said : ' the 2012/13 wages to revenue ratio for @entity20 clubs of 106 per cent is the highest ever recorded by an @entity70 division and is clearly unsustainable without ongoing owner support			2
' the introduction of the @entity73 was widely seen , and advocated by the clubs who voted it in , as a necessary step to change clubs ’ behaviour			0
the severity of the punishments applied to those who have not complied with the rules in the 2013/14 season and the eventual result of efforts to change the rules , will determine the extent to which they present an effective deterrent to widespread overspending			0
