it is regarded as the most probable place in the solar system to host alien life			1
and now @entity5 ’s @entity4 has been found to have tectonic activity like @entity7			1
it is also the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet			1
scientists have found evidence of plate tectonics on @entity18 ( pictured ) – the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than @entity7 , raising hopes that life could one day be found there less than a year ago , scientists discovered plumes of water vapour erupting from @entity5 's moon ’s south polar region , so it may be possible for a robotic probe to sample @entity32 ’s liquid water at a distance without landing on it			1
the latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists for years			1
until now , researchers have had visual evidence of @entity32 ’s icy crust expanding , but they could never find areas where the old crust was being destroyed to make room for the new			1
examining images of the moon taken by @entity53 ’s @entity52 in the early 2000s , planetary geologists @entity45 of the @entity46 and @entity47 of the @entity48 in @entity49 , discovered some unusual geological boundaries			1
the surface of @entity32 is slightly smaller than the @entity7 ’s moon and is riddled with cracks and ridges			1
blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the @entity63 move past each other on @entity7			2
the surface of @entity32 is slightly smaller than the @entity7 ’s moon and is riddled with cracks and ridges			1
blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the @entity63 move past each other on @entity7 @entity32 is the sixth closest moon to @entity5 and the smallest of the four @entity72 satellites that belong to the planet			1
it was discovered by @entity74 in january 1610 and is named after a @entity76 noblewoman in @entity78 mythology who was courted by @entity79 and became the queen of @entity81			0
@entity32 orbits @entity5 in around three - and - a - half days with an orbital radius of 670,900km			0
it is slightly smaller than the @entity7 's moon , but at 3,100km in diameter it is the sixth largest moon and 15th largest object in the entire solar system			1
it is likely to have an outer layer of water , some 100km thick			0
the outer layer of the water is believed to be frozen with a liquid ocean underneath			0
the moon has plate tectonics like on @entity7			1
it is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface , which is tectonically active and relatively young			1
many parts of @entity32 ’s surface show evidence of extension , where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart , and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap , a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading , according to the study published in the journal @entity115			1
‘ we have been puzzled for years as to how all this new terrain could be formed , but we could n’t figure out how it was accommodated			0
we finally think we ’ve found the answer , ’ dr @entity47 said			0
scientists studying @entity32 often reconstruct the moon ’s blocks into their original configuration to get a picture of what the surface looked like before disruption occurred			2
it was when they were rearranging the terrain that the two experts discovered that more than 12,000 square miles ( nearly 20,000 square km ) of the surface in the moon ’s high northern latitudes was missing			0
further evidence suggested that the missing terrain had moved under a second surface plate - a scenario commonly seen on @entity7 at plate - tectonic boundaries			2
the two scientists said that ice volcanoes on the overriding plate possibly formed through melting and absorption of the slab as it moved below the surface , while a lack of mountains at the subduction zone , implies that material was pushed into the interior rather than crumpled up as the two plates mashed against each other			0
the surface of @entity32 is slightly smaller than the @entity7 's moon and is riddled with cracks and ridges			2
blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the @entity63 ( pictured in @entity161 in @entity162 ) move past each other on @entity7 less than a year ago , scientists discovered plumes of water vapour erupting from the moon ’s south polar region ( illustrated ) , so it may be possible for a robotic probe to sample @entity32 ’s liquid water at a distance without landing on it they believe the subducted slab has been absorbed into @entity32 's ice shell – which may be up to 20 miles ( about 30 kilometers ) thick - rather than diving through it into the moon ’s underlying ocean			1
@entity32 ’s surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old , which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics as older material was destroyed			1
scientists have previously seen evidence of material moving up from under the shell , but until now , no mechanism had been found for moving material back into the shell , and possibly into the large ocean below the ice			0
‘ @entity32 may be more earthlike than we imagined if it has a global plate tectonic system , ’ dr @entity45 said			2
he told @entity189 : ‘ @entity7 may not be alone			0
there may be another body out there that has plate tectonics			2
and not only that , it 's ice ! ’ there have been various proposals to explore @entity32 over the years , such as the @entity197 ( pictured ) which would be taken underground by a larger drill before it was then released into the ocean , searching for signs of past or present alien life ‘ not only does this discovery make it one of the most geologically interesting bodies in the solar system , it also implies two - way communication between the exterior and interior – a way to move material from the surface into the subsurface – a process which has significant implications for @entity32 ’s potential as a habitable world			1
’ some scientists said that plate tectonics were essential to how life evolved on @entity7			1
the theory goes that tectonics replenished nutrients and helped to stabilise the @entity7 ’s climate			2
@entity5 's moon ’s shell is thought to be 12 to 19 miles ( 20 to 30 kilometres ) thick to subducting plates probably plunge a mile below the surface , so it is unlikely that nutrients from the surface are carried down to the ocean quickly			0
but dr @entity45 said that this could possibly happen over time			0
@entity53 has set aside £ 14.6 million ( $ 25 million ) to design probes that could reveal whether @entity32 is habitable			0
in july , the agency asked scientists to come forward with potential experiments for a @entity32 probe that could be launched in the 2020s and arrive at the icy satellite within three years of take - off			1
it said that next year , about 20 proposals will be chosen to receive shares of the £ 14.6 million ( $ 25 million ) for further study			0
the mission is designed to characterise the extent of @entity32 's ocean and its relation to the deeper interior			0
it will also look at the ice shell and determine global surface , compositions and chemistry , especially related to whether life could survive in that environment			0
previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon 's icy crust			2
this ocean covers @entity32 entirely and contains more liquid water than all of @entity7 's oceans combined			2
although @entity32 and @entity5 's other moons have been visited by other spacecraft , they were each limited to a single distant flyby of these satellites			0
@entity53 ’s @entity52 spacecraft , launched in 1989 by the space shuttle , was the only mission to make repeated visits to @entity32 , passing close by the moon fewer than a dozen times			0
in december 2013 , @entity53 ’s @entity274 observed water vapour above the moon 's frigid south polar region			0
this provided the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon 's surface , and a spacecraft could even be designed to fly through the plumes to make measurements of the composition of the underground ocean .			0

scientists have found the first sign of this geologic activity on a solar system world other than @entity7 a year after discovering jets of water on *europa*
experts from the @entity46 and the @entity48 , @entity49 , say @entity32 could be more @entity7 - like than experts imagined
latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists
it shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding
@entity32 ’s surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old , which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics
