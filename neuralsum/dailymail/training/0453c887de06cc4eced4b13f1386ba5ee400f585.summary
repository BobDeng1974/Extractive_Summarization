by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages			1
called @entity7 , it is being developed at @entity8 , the company 's secret research lab , which is also developing its self - driving car and @entity13 wearable computer			1
the firm says the drones could eventually be used for disaster relief by delivering aid to isolated areas - and for package delivery			1
' self - flying vehicles could open up entirely new approaches to moving goods – including options that are cheaper , faster , less wasteful and more environmentally sensitive than what 's possible today , ' the firm said			2
' there 's a lot of friction in how we do things currently – double - parked delivery trucks clog city streets , traffic jams choke the fast - growing cities of @entity41 and @entity42			1
' @entity7 's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m ( 4.9ft ) and have four electrically - driven propellers			1
they will fly a programmed route with just the push of a button , and they 'll follow rules to respond safely if they run into unexpected situations like a gust of wind , @entity2 says			2
the project was originally envisaged by @entity2 boss @entity57 as a way to deliver defibrillators to heart attack victims , but has since been expanded			1
' even just a few of these , being able to shuttle nearly continuously could service a very large number of people in an emergency situation , ' @entity61 , captain of @entity63 - @entity8 's name for big - thinking projects , told the @entity70			2
@entity7 's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m ( 4.9ft ) and have four electrically - driven propellers			1
the total weight , including the package to be delivered , is approximately 10kg ( 22lb )			0
the aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg ( 18.7lb )			0
the hybrid ' tail sitter ' design has wings for fast forward flight , and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take - off and landing			1
dual mode operation gives the self - flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters			0
it can take off or land without a runway , and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages			0
packages are stored in the drone 's ' belly ' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground			0
at the end of the tether , there 's a little bundle of electronics the team call the ' egg , ' which detects that the package has hit the ground , detaches from the delivery , and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle			0
' we expect it will take years to develop a service with multiple vehicles flying multiple deliveries per day , ' @entity2 said			1
eventually @entity2 said it could use unmanned flying vehicles to deliver shopping items to consumers at home			1
' self - flying vehicles could open up entirely new approaches to moving goods – including options that are cheaper , faster , less wasteful and more environmentally sensitive than what 's possible today , ' the firm said			2
' throughout history , major shifts in how we move goods from place to place have led to new opportunities for economic growth and generally made consumers ' lives easier			0
' from steam ships to the railroads , from the postal service to delivery services like @entity142 and @entity143 , speed has reshaped society not only with greater convenience but also by making more goods accessible to more people			2
' furthermore , there 's a lot of friction in how we do things currently – double - parked delivery trucks clog city streets , traffic jams choke the fast - growing cities of @entity41 and @entity42			1
and have you ever thought about how environmentally unfriendly it is to send a 2000kg car across town with a 2kg package of food ? ' the prototype vehicles that the company has built have successfully been tested by delivering packages to remote farms in @entity167 , @entity21 from neighbouring properties			1
@entity21 was selected as a test site due to what @entity2 calls ' progressive ' rules about the use of drones , which are more tightly controlled in other parts of the word			1

the drones could compete with @entity206 's @entity205 plans			0
@entity206 is asking the @entity207 for permission to use drones as part of its plan to deliver packages to customers in 30 minutes or less			2
the online retailer created a media frenzy in december when it outlined a plan on @entity218 ' 60 minutes to deliver packages with self - guided aircrafts that seemed straight out of science fiction			2
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds			0
about 86 percent of @entity206 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said			0
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making @entity205 available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' @entity206 said .			0

@entity2 has been working on @entity7 for two years
has already tested system in @entity21
@entity235 ' tail sitter ' design has wings for fast forward flight , and rotors for hovering for delivery and take - off and landing
goal to develop drones that could be used for disaster relief
could also deliver goods in urban areas
