by @entity0 @entity1 has urged northern cities to adopt @entity4 - style elected mayors – just two years after thousands of voters said they did not want them			2
the chancellor offered cities ‘ serious devolution of powers and budgets ’ if they agree to vest authority in directly elected figure like the mayor of @entity14			1
the pledge comes despite the fact that voters in 2012 across the north delivered the government a humiliating blow by throwing out plans for elected mayors			0
@entity1 has urged northern cities to adopt @entity4 - style elected mayors - just two years after thousands of voters said they did not want them @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 all rejected the idea in referendums			1
in @entity24 yesterday mr @entity1 said he is ready to offer a bigger carrot in terms of local decision - making power to tempt the cities to reconsider			1
his offer came as he set out his vision of an economic ‘ powerhouse ’ in the north of @entity41 , with a high - speed rail link between @entity24 and @entity27			1
the chancellor said the combined economic and creative energies of northern cities could compete on a global scale			0
bringing the cities of the north together could create a second ‘ global city ’ for the @entity49 , which would be not a rival but a ‘ brother in arms ’ for @entity14 as they fight to grow @entity49 ’s share in the world economy , he said			0
but he set no timescale on the high - speed rail line – dubbed @entity58 – or give any indication about its route			0
mr @entity1 said there was a ‘ strong case ’ for more elected mayors who could drive growth and development in northern cities			1
@entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 all rejected the idea to have mayors - similar to @entity14 - in referendums ‘ a true powerhouse requires true power , ’ he said			1
‘ so today i am … starting the conversation about serious devolution of powers and budgets for any city that wants to move to a new model of city government – and have an elected mayor			2
’ mr @entity1 said the northern cities should consider the value to @entity14 of having a strong and globally - recognised city leader in @entity4 – ‘ the haircut that is recognised all over the world ’			1
‘ @entity83 has its own parliament , and can pass its own laws			0
the economies of @entity24 and @entity27 are each individually bigger than @entity83			2
but they do n’t have a single leader who can speak for the whole area			0
’ the chancellor ’s vision of a high speed rail link was praised by @entity93 figures in the north last night – but attacked by shadow chancellor @entity95			0
the mayor of @entity97 welcomed the chancellor ’s ‘ bold step ’ , while the leader of @entity27 council , @entity30 , said : ‘ i ’m delighted @entity1 appears to be listening to the leaders of northern cities and accepting the role our cities have to play in the national economy			1
’ but mr @entity95 said : ‘ the @entity108 scrapped @entity93 ’s successful regional development agencies , failed to implement @entity111 ’s growth report and are planning to cut infrastructure investment next year			0
’ lord @entity113 said that much of mr @entity1 ’s vision echoed the @entity116 initiative , which he launched in 2004 to drive growth across the region			2
‘ this is more about northern votes than northern growth , ’ he said @entity113 .			0

made plea despite @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 all rejected the idea in referendums
