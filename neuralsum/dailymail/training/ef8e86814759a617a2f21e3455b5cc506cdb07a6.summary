a teacher who appeared in the tv documentary @entity1 has been banned from the classroom after having sex with two former pupils			1
@entity5 , 35 , began a relationship with an 18 - year - old girl following his school ’s end of term ball , which continued after she went to university			1
the fling ended when @entity5 ‘ rekindled a relationship ’ with another ex-pupil of the same school , whom he met on a night out			1
his ‘ inappropriate ’ contact with one 17 - year - old girl was deemed to be ‘ sexually motivated ’ and included chats about cross-dressing			1
he told the vulnerable teenager about a sexual fantasy which involved her ‘ on top of him ’ in school uniform			2
all the girls he targeted were pupils or ex-pupils of @entity23 in @entity24 , where he taught history before moving in 2012 to @entity45 near @entity46 , @entity47 , which was featured in the award - winning @entity49 series			1
an investigation was launched in january last year after a report that @entity5 was communicating in an inappropriate way with the 17 - year - old , named only as @entity55 , from his former school			1
he was suspended from his job as head of humanities at @entity60 and resigned three months later			0
@entity5 also admitted sending sexual messages to a vulnerable 17 - year - old girl from @entity63 while he was working at @entity64 , where educating @entity47 was filmed ( file image showing @entity60 headteacher @entity66 ) details of his behaviour and indefinite teaching ban were revealed by the @entity70 in a summary of the disciplinary panel ’s findings			1
@entity5 admitted allegations concerning five pupils between 2007 and 2012			1
the panel was told how he sent messages to three pupils at the @entity24 school on @entity80 after moving to his new job			1
he hid his identity by using fake names – @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
only @entity55 responded , and they began chatting over social media			0
@entity5 soon admitted his real identity to his former student , who had special educational needs			1
through text and @entity99 messages to the girl , he ‘ raised a question about what students thought of cross-dressing ’ , the panel heard			2
he said he was jealous of her and other girls in her class who ‘ looked sexy in tights ’ because he wanted to wear them himself			2
@entity5 sent messages discussing sexual fantasies , including imagining @entity55 in her school uniform and smoking a cigarette ‘ on top of him ’			1
the girl told police she had begun to trust him			0
while employed at @entity60 ( pictured ) @entity5 sent the girl @entity80 messages discussing cross-dressing , and saying that he wanted to see her ' in her school uniform and smoking a cigarette on top of him ' @entity5 told investigators he regarded the messages as ‘ silly conversations ’ and that he had been drinking when he sent some of them			1
but inquiries also uncovered an ‘ inappropriate relationship ’ with a year 13 pupil several years earlier			0
@entity5 said it started during the summer holidays when he saw her as a ‘ former pupil ’			2
the panel heard they saw each other for about six months and became ‘ intimate ’ when the girl went to university			0
another sexual relationship with an ex-pupil from the same school was not found to be inappropriate , as the girl was not at @entity137 while @entity5 taught there			2
they had ‘ met on a night out in @entity139 ’ rather than at school , the panel was told			0
@entity142 for life from teaching in any school or children ’s home in @entity147 , the panel concluded that he had ‘ acted dishonestly and breached his position of trust ’			0
@entity5 had claimed he used the fake @entity80 accounts to ‘ escape ’ from stress and financial problems			2
he was not available for comment yesterday			0
@entity5 was banned from teaching after admitting to having a sexual relationship with two girls , one of which was ruled to be inappropriate			1
both of them had left school when the relationships took place , but teaching guidelines were still applied			0
this is because the guide allows for any behaviour ' within and outside school ' to be considered , if it might call the profession into disrepute			0
of the two sexual relationships @entity5 admitted , the one that was found to be inappropriate was with a girl who had been at @entity23 while @entity5 was teaching there			1
this is because the guide specifically refers to ' safeguarding pupils '			0
the second girl likely can not be considered a @entity5 's pupil if she was not at the school at the same time as him			2
the panel also said they were concerned ' that there was a pattern of repetition ' to @entity5 's actions that put vulnerable students at risk as well as engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a girl who had left the school , @entity5 went on to send ' sexually motivated ' messages to current pupils			1
when he was questioned over his behaviour towards @entity55 , he acknowledged he was wrong and deactivated his @entity195 account , only to reactivate it and carry on offending			0
his behaviour fell ' significantly short ' of the teachers ’ standards , which say instructors must ' uphold public trust in the profession and maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour			0
' the panel also found that he showed little understanding of the impact of his actions , especially considering that one girl had special educational needs			0
he was given a lifetime ban from the classroom on the grounds of unacceptable personal conduct which was likely to bring the profession into disrepute .			0
