by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 17 october 2013 a teacher was so embarrassed by a pupil 's naughty comment about her weight that she shed a massive eight stone			1
primary school teacher @entity6 weighed nearly 18 stone and was teaching a year 3 class when she heard an eight - year - old boy turn to a classmate and make a cheeky remark			1
she said : ' i 'd arrived at the school for a work placement just three days before			2
@entity6 was prompted to lose eight stone from 18 stone ( left ) to 9 stone ( right ) ' one of the little boys i was teaching turned to a classmate and whispered : ' miss @entity6 's fat			1
' ' the whole class heard and giggled out of surprise			2
i knew i should have disciplined him for being rude , but despite myself i was too embarrassed			0
' i was absolutely mortified			0
i thought : ' i 'm so fat , even the children are laughing at me '			0
the episode , which occurred during a teacher training work placement at @entity28 's primary school , launched @entity29 , of @entity30 , into an intensive 18 - month weight - loss programme which saw her ditch her usual chips and takeaways for healthier alternatives			1
@entity6 , pictured before her dramatic weight loss with boyfriend @entity36 , says her diet consisted mainly of junk food she was supported in her quest for a slimmer figure by personal trainer boyfriend @entity41 , 28			1
she said : ' @entity36 said my size did n't matter and i knew he meant it , but i still felt huge and disgusting			2
the pupil 's comment spurred me into action			1
' just a month later , @entity6 celebrated the start of 2011 at a @entity49 celebration with @entity36 and was shocked when she looked at the photographs taken of her that evening			1
she recalled : ' it was the final straw			0
i looked really horrible in the pictures			0
i knew i had to do something to lose the excess weight			0
@entity6 says that she used to pretend that her size did n't bother her ' i 'd always been conscious of my size , but i tried to ignore the fact that i had got so big			1
' @entity36 said he loved me how i was , and i tried to pretend i did n't care as i threw myself into my teacher training degree			0
' she struggled to control the urge to overeat and used any excuse as a chance to overindulge			0
' at least three times a week i 'd feast on greasy takeaways , ' she said			0
' while i was attending university for my teacher training i 'd snack on chocolate , crisps and biscuits			0
' determined to take back control of her life , she joined a slimming class in january 2011 and learned how to make simple and healthy meals			2
@entity6 says she is now grateful to the cheeky pupil for prompting her to address her unhealthy diet she said : ' straight away i realised how bad my diet was			1
no wonder i had got fat , with all the junk food i was eating			1
' @entity6 began taking long walks and started swimming with @entity36			2
by the summer of 2012 , @entity6 had dropped from dress size 22 to size eight and was celebrating the fact she had reached her target weight of nine stone			1
' as the weight fell off , i felt like a different person , ' she said			0
before her dramatic weight loss , @entity6 's breakfast was typically made up of a bacon sandwich on white bread with butter or a bowl of @entity95			1
lunch would be a shop - bought pizza or a pasty with a sandwich , and dinnertime consisted of chips with gravy as an after - work snack , followed by curry from a jar			0
@entity6 , with the support of personal trainer boyfriend @entity36 , totally changed her diet and now eats healthy , snacking on fruit and vegetables between meals she would snack on crisps , chocolates and cakes			1
now , breakfast is usually porridge and fruit , followed by a jacket potato with beans and salad for lunch			2
a favourite dinner is spaghetti bolognese with extra-lean mince			0
the sweet and salty snacks have been replaced with fruit or vegetable sticks			0
@entity6 , who graduated from her teacher training course this year and is currently looking for a permanent placement , said she is delighted with the reaction she 's had			2
she said : ' a couple of former coursemates did n't recognise me at first because i look so different			0
they could n't believe i was the same person when i showed them some old photographs			0
it made me feel proud of my achievement			2
' @entity6 is now grateful for her pupils comment , and is enjoying wearing figure hugging - size eight dresses			1
' if boys in class are giggling behind my back i 'm told it 's because they 've got a crush on me , ' she said .			1

@entity6 , 22 , went from 18st to *9st* and from size 22 to size 8
embarked on 18 month diet after cruel comment by a pupil
helped by personal trainer boyfriend @entity41 , 28
*swapped* junk food for porridge , salads and healthy home made dinners
' if boys in class are giggling now it 's because they 've got a crush on me '
