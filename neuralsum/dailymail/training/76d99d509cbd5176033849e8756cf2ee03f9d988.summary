we have showed him the cctv and he now accepts his injuries were caused during the fall			0
' having had oversight of the investigation ... i accept his report was made in good faith			0

he wrote : ' here is my face after a homophobic attack : four of my teeth are gone , not fallen out but deep inside my gums and cheek ... my face is swollen , both my knees are badly injured and i struggle to walk ... @entity5 wo n't be charged with wasting police time as he really believed he had been attacked , police said ' my whole face is constantly throbbing and i 'm now on four tablets a day for pain and infection and may require surgery to sort out the damage			1
' all of this and what was their motive ? because of my f * * * * * * sexuality			0
' police initially said @entity5 was left so disorientated by the attack , he could not recall exactly where he was assaulted			2

in an interview with his local paper , he said : ' i heard a group of men shouting homophobic abuse at me			0
student : @entity5 studies contemporary theatre and performance at the @entity42 ' the next thing i know i was punched in the back of the head			2
i was violently assaulted - all because of my sexuality			0
' i was covered in blood and had my face stamped on , causing my teeth to go into my gums			0
i might need surgery to amend the damage done			0
it ’s absolutely disgraceful to violently attack someone because of who they are			0
' @entity5 went on : ' from all of this , all i want is awareness ... i want people to see what can happen if you are as stupid as me to be alone on a night out '			2
