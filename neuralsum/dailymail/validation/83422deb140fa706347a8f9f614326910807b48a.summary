@entity0 was today accused of ' making it up as he goes along ' as @entity2 ditched the idea of capping immigration			1
the @entity2 leader is setting out his party 's policy on immigration , claiming the current system is ' unsustainable , unethical and unfair ' and calling for more high - skilled workers and people from the @entity11 to be allowed into @entity12			1
but during a radio interview it ditched the idea of reducing net migration to below 50,000 , which had been backed by @entity2 's immigration spokesman @entity18 just last week			1
a split also emerged over the party 's policy towards people with serious illnesses coming into the @entity12 , with mr @entity18 backing them but mr @entity0 suggesting they were not welcome			1
in a keynote speech , he will call for future immigration to focus on highly - skilled workers and ' our friends from the @entity11 ' as opposed to ' low - skilled , eastern @entity43 migration '			1
the party has attacked @entity45 for failing to meet his promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands			2
new figures last week showed it hit almost 300,000 in the year to september			0
in response , mr @entity18 said : ' we will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the @entity12 by introducing a fairer			1
' at last year 's party conference , mr @entity18 announced : ' @entity2 commits to bringing @entity12 net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year			1
' but mr @entity0 today jettisoned the idea , claiming that under an @entity62 - style system it was ' very unlikely that we would need 50,000 people '			1
he told @entity65 's programme @entity2 would bring immigration levels ' back to normality ' , with numbers similar to those seen before 2000			1
but he added : ' i 'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that			0
the point is this : we currently have no control over the numbers , we are incapable of debating anything now in politics without caps and targets and i think the @entity12 public are bored with it			0
' mr @entity0 was spotted wearing songs featuring pound signs as he addressed the media and party members mr @entity0 used a speech at the @entity90 in @entity91 to call for for future immigration to focus on highly - skilled workers and ' our friends from the @entity11 ' as opposed to ' low - skilled , eastern @entity43 migration ' fresh confusion emerged today over the @entity2 policy on migrants with serious illnesses			1
the party 's immigration spokesman @entity18 told @entity103 : ' if someone came to our borders and was on there , you know at the border control and they announce that they 've got a cancer or tumour we are not going to turn them away			1
' what sort of nation are we to do that ? that is n't going to happen			0
' but mr @entity0 told the @entity65 : ' we want people with skills and trades they can bring to @entity12			0
“ we want people who have n't got a criminal record			0
“ we want people who have n't got a life threatening illness			0
' he later told @entity126 that he had discussed the policy with mr @entity18 yesterday			1
' policies evolve , they develop , they move on			0
i do n't want the emphasis from today to be what our cap is ; what i want it to be today is the fact that @entity2 is putting forward a policy that will take immigration into @entity12 back to normal			1
' our intention is to bring net immigration into @entity12 back to 20,000 to 50,000 a year			2
it 's a range , it 's a range			0
well again , you see , you ca n't help it you guys , you 're obsessed with targets , let 's talk about policy			2
' the u-turn was seized on by the @entity149 as proof that @entity2 's policy was in chaos			1
chancellor @entity153 said : ' @entity0 seems to be making it up as he goes along , one moment he is proposing a cap and then he is ditching it live on air – a novel approach to policy making			1
' we are the people with a sensible plan , whether it 's on the economy or immigration			1
' the @entity165 are to repeat the promise to limit net migration to the ' tens of thousands ' , despite missing it so spectacularly			0
' this is absolutely our ambition , ' mr @entity153 said			2
' of course we have n't met it in this parliament , as everyone knows			0
' that 's partly because the @entity12 economy has been so much stronger than other @entity43 economies			0
' but the way to deal with this is the welfare reforms that @entity45 has set out so you ca n't just turn up in this country and claim welfare from day one			0
' @entity165 chancellor @entity153 accused the @entity2 leader of ' making it up as he goes along ' , as he stood by the @entity165 promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands @entity2 's immigration spokesman @entity18 @entity2 's immigration spokesman @entity18 has repeatedly promised a cap on immigration			1
just last week he said his party would ' set a cap ' on the numbers of people able to come to the @entity12 : september 26 : ' within the points based system @entity2 commits to bringing @entity12 net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year ' october 23 : ' i promised to cap migration to 50,000 a year ' february 26 : ' we will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the @entity12 by introducing a fairer , and more transparent points based system ensuring we get the skilled immigrants we need and in numbers that the economy can manage ' @entity2 's proposals depend on @entity12 leaving the @entity211 , and include an @entity62 - style points - based visa system which , it says , would ensure the right numbers of highly - skilled workers were able to enter the country while imposing a five - year moratorium on visas for unskilled workers			1
rules discriminating between @entity211 ( @entity211 ) and non-eu nationals would be abolished , and those workers who qualified under the system would be issued with a visa valid for five years			2
during that time , they would not be entitled to claim @entity12 benefits and would be expected to take out health insurance			0
after five years they would be entitled to apply for permanent leave to remain , provided they had not broken the law			0
mr @entity0 said : ' the @entity12 public has acknowledged that they ca n't trust the other parties to be serious on immigration			0
' despite mr @entity45 's pledge , net migration is now up to 300,000 people per year			2
it is unsustainable , unfair and unethical			2
' that 's why @entity2 has developed a policy focused around an @entity62 - style points - based system , led by a newly - formed migration control commission , tasked with bringing numbers down and focusing on highly - skilled migrants and our @entity11 friends - as opposed to the low - skilled , eastern @entity43 migration that the @entity149 and @entity249 have expanded			1
' mr @entity0 insisted ' normal was from 1950 until the year 2000 '			0
' i am not getting caught up with ridiculous arguments about caps , ' he added			0
' there is no u-turn , there is a change of emphasis			0
' he went on : ' our intention is to bring net immigration into @entity12 back to 20,000 - 50,000 a year			2
that 's a range ... ' you ca n't help it , you guys - you are obsessed with targets , obsessed with targets			2
let 's talk about policy			2
' mr @entity0 said a mooted £ 27,000 lower limit on earnings to gain access to the @entity12 was ' not absolute ' and there could be exemptions for some skills , such as nurses .			0
