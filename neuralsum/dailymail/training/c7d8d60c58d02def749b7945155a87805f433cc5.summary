@entity1 leader @entity0 , 49 , delivered a eulogy for the ages in honour of @entity5 on wednesday , referring in most reverent terms to @entity8 21st prime minister as ' this old man ' who was ' truly @entity8 's greatest white elder '			1
as he listed off the @entity5 achievements one - by - one , he told the congregation in @entity14 's @entity13 and those watching in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , that @entity5 provided equalities and opportunities to his people , unmatched before or since			1
those present were held spellbound by the @entity24 @entity23 oratory , in which the renowned lawyer and academic announced ' i do n’t know why someone with this old man ’s upper - middle class background could carry such a burning conviction that the barriers of class and race of the @entity8 of his upbringing and maturation should be torn down and replaced with the unapologetic principle of equality '			1
' mr @entity0 outlined how important the @entity5 overhaul of discrimination laws was to @entity8 's indigenous communities			1
' raised next to the wood - heap of the nation 's democracy , bequeathed no allegiance to no political party i speak to this old man 's legacy with no partisan brief , ' he announced			2
' rather , my signal honour today on behalf of more people than i could ever know , is to express our immense gratitude for the public service of this old man			0
' outlawing the discrimination that my father and his father lived under since my grandfather was removed to the mission as a boy			2
' he would go on to tell the story of when , in 1976 , in the western @entity92 , @entity1 farmer @entity91 sought to buy a pastoral lease from its white owner but the @entity95 refused the sale			1
the @entity97 , however , upheld the then @entity98			0
a candle is lit next to a portrait of former @entity8 prime minister @entity5 at @entity13 ahead of his @entity48			1
@entity5 was the 21st prime minister of australia			1
he died on october 21 , aged 98 ' however , in an act of spite the @entity95 converted the lease into national park , ' he stated			0
' @entity91 died a broken man			0
the winner of a landmark @entity97 precedent but the victim of an appalling discrimination			0
' without this old man , the land and human rights of our people would never have seen the light of day			2
' there would never have been @entity117 and its importance to the history of @entity8 would have been lost without the @entity5 program			1
' only those who have known discrimination truly know its evil			0
' only those who have never experienced prejudice can discount the importance of the @entity98			0
this old man was one of those rare people who never suffered discrimination but understood the importance of protection from its malice			0
' his next statement drew a rousing reception			0
those listening to @entity0 's requiem heard him say that ' without this old man , the land and human rights of our people would never have seen the light of day ' emotional times			1
former prime minister @entity140 listens intently as speakers , including @entity0 and @entity142 , pay tribute to @entity5 ' the @entity144 is the text - book case of reform trumping management , ' he stated			1
' in less than three years , an astonishing reform agenda , leapt off the policy platform and into legislation and the machinery and programs of government			0
' the country would change forever , the modern cosmopolitan @entity8 finally emerged like a technicolour butterfly from its long dormant chrysalis			2
' and 38 years later we are like @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity161 's @entity160 ranting against the despotic rule of @entity163 , defiantly demanding " and what did the @entity164 ever do for us anyway ? " ' apart from @entity177 and the @entity178 , cutting tariff protections , no - fault divorce and the family law act , the @entity182 , the @entity183 , the @entity184 , federal legal aid , the racial discrimination act , needs - based school funding , the recognition of @entity175 , the abolition of conscription , the law reform commission , student financial assistance , the heritage commission , non discriminatory immigration laws , community health clinics , @entity1 land rights , paid maternity leave for public servants , lowering the minimum voting age to 18 years and fair electoral boundaries and senate representation for the territories ... apart from all this , what did this @entity164 ever do for us ? ' mr @entity0 , founder of the @entity195 , told those listening that mr @entity5 was before his time			1
' there is no need for nostalgia and yearning for what might have been , ' he said			0
' the achievements of this old man are present in the institutions we today take for granted and played no small part in the progress in modern @entity8 ' there is no need to regret three years was too short , was any more time needed ? ' the breadth and depth of the reforms secured in that short and tumultuous period were unprecedented and will likely never again be repeated			2
' the devil - may - care attitude to management as opposed to reform is unlikely to be seen again by governments whose priorities are to retain power rather than reform			0
' we could not be more indebted to this old man 's foresight and moral vision for universal opportunity			0
' we salute this old man for his great love and dedication to his country and to the @entity8 people			2
' when he breathed he truly was @entity8 's greatest white elder and friend without peer to the original @entity8			1
