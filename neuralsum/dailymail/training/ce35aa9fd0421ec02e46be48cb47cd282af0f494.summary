@entity1 boss @entity0 believes @entity2 can be the answer to his striker shortage but insists a deal has not yet been completed for the @entity7 forward			1
@entity2 , who joined the @entity7 from @entity9 side @entity8 in the summer , reportedly underwent a medical at @entity1 on tuesday after struggling to establish himself at @entity11			1
@entity0 has made no secret of his desire to add at least one more striker to his squad in january and the @entity1 manager believes @entity2 fits the bill			1
@entity19 boss @entity0 has admitted he is keen on loaning @entity7 forward @entity2 the @entity9 was the first of nine signings made by @entity7 in the summer but has n't nailed down a spot ' he 's a player we 've been talking about loaning , it 's not done yet though , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's a no 10 , a clever player who can open the door			0
' i first came across him at @entity29 a few years back when he played under @entity30			0
' it 's not done and dusted it 's just something we 're interested in - we are looking to loan a player or two			0
' @entity2 has scored two goals in seven league appearances for @entity7 this season but has struggled for a starting spot ahead of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity7 boss @entity42 responded to claims he had treated @entity2 unfairly by insisting the 27 - year - old had simply not been good enough to secure a regular place in the side			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity42 said he 's done well enough but you can see why he has n't played - they 've got @entity39 , @entity49 , @entity41 , @entity50 and @entity2 - they 've got five strikers			1
' they 're good players and they 've been in great form , they 're a threat to anybody so it 's been difficult for @entity2 to get in			2
' maybe @entity42 prefers the others and they 've been in great form so you can see why			0
' @entity0 is hoping to bolster his attacking options to avoid relying on @entity61 @entity1 boss @entity0 has labelled @entity7 outcast @entity64 a ' clever no 10 ' @entity0 added : ' it 's important to have options up front			1
you need somebody else to weigh in with goals			0
' we ca n't rely on @entity61 ( @entity72 ) getting all the goals			0
' it 's an area we 're looking at but it 's difficult , who is going to loan you a striker who will score 10 to 12 goals before the end of the season ? everyone is looking for a striker			0
' a goalless draw at home to @entity85 on sunday leaves @entity1 15th in the table and two points above the relegation zone			2
@entity0 's side host @entity89 on @entity91 , hoping to continue their excellent form at @entity93 which includes three wins in their last four home matches			2
' our home form has been fantastic for us , we 've been difficult to beat at home , ' @entity0 said			2
' we now play all the top teams at home in the second half of the season and we go away to the bottom teams			0
' @entity0 added : ' @entity89 are a good side , @entity102 has done a great job with them and he 's just carried on from where they were			2
' they 've had great managers in the last few years , who have gone on to do great things and he 's another in that line			0
