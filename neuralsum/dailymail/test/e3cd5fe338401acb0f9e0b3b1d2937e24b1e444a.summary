the kidnapper who claims to have masterminded the @entity2 kidnapping of @entity3 in @entity4 says he will turn himself in , but only if his co-conspirators are given immunity			1
in yet another email to the @entity9 , the individuals wrote that police could accept this offer , or that he would ' go overseas and teach @entity12 ' or ' live off the grid and read books for the rest of my life			1
' this came just one day after the group demanded an apology from the police for calling the entire incident a hoax			2
@entity23 , 29 , was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on march 23 , then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents ' home			1
after her ' release ' police accused them of staging the kidnapping â€“ a claim they both strongly denied			2
but it will be made crystal clear that the @entity46 , and you , mr. [ @entity63 , had every opportunity to stop it			0
' last week @entity67 , the spokesman for the @entity46 , said that the kidnapping of @entity41 , which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers , 40 detectives and numerous @entity73 agents , was an ' orchestrated event			2
' the letter to the @entity9 says authorities had until noon on tuesday to apologize			2
that time came and went however , and this new email arrived tuesday afternoon			0
the old email had demanded that the police make clear that neither @entity41 or her boyfriend @entity52 - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges			1
as for the main reason behind the kidnapping , they write ; ' the @entity90 kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets			0
' they then compare themselves to the cast of @entity98 , the famous caper film that starred members of the @entity100 when it premiered in 1960 and @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 in the 2001 remake			0
it is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either , also reaching out to them on march 24 with an audio file of @entity41 to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in @entity90			1
she eventually turned up in @entity114 , where both of her parents live , just a few hours later			0
this latest email , sent on saturday from a dummy account , was 9,000 words long , and detailed why the group kidnapped @entity3 , and how they went about taking her from her home			0
the group consists of three members , two with college educations , and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area			0
they claim they drilled holes in the window of @entity41 and @entity52 's home to gain entry , and then used squirt guns with ' strobe flashlights and laser pointers ' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms			1
they say they played ' calming music ' as they went about the abduction , and put monitors on @entity52 , 30 , so they could make sure he did not go to police			1
they then say they put @entity41 in the trunk of @entity52 's car and drove off with her			1
the group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of @entity41 and @entity52 's home ( above ) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take @entity41 the kidnapping , which has been called an ' orchestrated event ' by authorities , has drawn comparisons to the film @entity2 ( above ) in the end however , they claim it was a case of mistaken identity , and they did not mean to take @entity41 , thinking that someone else would be in the house			1
they say that is why they decided to drop her off in @entity114 and that they were ' horrified at what we had done			0
' as for the ransom they requested , what police believe to be a rather paltry $ 8,500 , the group said : ' we chose $ 8,500 because it was below the $ 10,000 reporting threshold , and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law			0
' attorneys for both @entity52 and @entity41 claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email , and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth			1
@entity23 ' attorney , @entity195 , said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used ' sophisticated computer skills ' that neither they or the @entity73 could ' comprehend			2
' @entity202 , the @entity46 and the @entity73 all have yet to comment on the emails .			0

the self - proclaimed kidnapper behind ' @entity207 abduction ' of @entity41 now says he will turn himself in to police
he *revealed* this in an email to the @entity9 , and said that his co-conspirators must be given immunity
he then said if police did not agree to this deal , he would go teach @entity12 overseas or ' go off the grid '
*huskins* and her boyfriend @entity52 have yet to make a *public* statement about the kidnapping
@entity23 , 29 , was allegedly snatched from her home on march 23 , then released one day later 400 miles away in her *childhood* *hometown*
her boyfriend @entity52 , 30 , was allegedly tied up and monitored by the kidnappers , which is why he could not go to police for 12 hours
