as the @entity1 and @entity2 jostled for supremacy during the cold war , both sides spent a great deal of time and money investigating how animals could be used as spies			1
many of the ideas sound bizarre , but at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , experts had a government contract to train animals specifically for defense and intelligence work			1
not all of their attempts were successful , some never got past the drawing board , but others were used during the cold war era for spying purposes included training ravens to deposit and retrieve objects , conditioning pigeons to warn of enemy ambushes and even teaching cats to eavesdrop on human conversations			1
@entity33 and his team at the @entity13 in @entity15 had government funding in the 60s and 70s to develop animals such as ravens for spying purposes @entity40 : using cochlear implants , @entity33 's team attempted to use cats as transmitters with a wire running from the cat ¿ s inner ear to a battery and instrument cluster implanted in its rib cage ‘ we never found an animal we could not train , ’ @entity33 , who worked on the program , told @entity52			1
now 76 , he was the first director of training in the @entity57 's @entity56 , before he joined @entity13 and becoming general manager of @entity13 ( @entity59 ) , the company who owned the zoo			2
although animals had been used for military intelligence purposes since ancient @entity67 times , it was during the 1960s that the work came especially into vogue			2
as well as a tourist destination where parents could take their children to watch chickens play baseball and macaws ride bicycles , the @entity13 started to receive funding from governments agencies - including the @entity80 - to use animals for other purposes			1
@entity13 was founded by @entity83 and @entity84 , who were advocates of operant conditioning to train animals such as this ' muscular goat ' which could trip a sledgehammer to ring a bell ‘ they came to us to solve problems , ’ said @entity33			1
‘ it was the height of the cold war			0
’ the zoo was opened by @entity84 and his wife @entity83 , who had been students of the psychologist @entity99 , who had devised the concept of operant conditioning and teaching animals to carry out complex processes			0
during @entity104 , @entity99 had received defense funding to research a pigeon - based homing device for missiles , although it was never deployed			2
prior to joining @entity13 , @entity33 had been the first director of training for the @entity57 ’s pioneering dolphin program , which developed methods of training them to perform tasks including detecting and clearing mines to retrieving tools			1
a partially declassified 1976 @entity80 document on naval dolphin training notes , the @entity120 were ‘ also assessing and replicating @entity1 systems while possibly developing countermeasures to certain @entity1 systems			0
’ soon after joining @entity59 , @entity33 got involved in the ‘ acoustic kitty ’ project , after the @entity80 ’s @entity123 had proposed using cats as listening devices			2
both the @entity2 and @entity1 tried to dolphins to perform tasks including detecting and clearing mines and retrieving tools according to @entity33 , the theory was that no one would pay attention to the animals ’ comings and goings			2
‘ we found that we could condition the cat to listen to voices , ’ said @entity33			2
‘ we have no idea how we did it			0
but ... we found that the cat would more and more listen to people ’s voices , and listen less to other things			0
’ using cochlear implants , his team attempted to use cats as transmitters with a wire running from the cat ’s inner ear to a battery and instrument cluster implanted in its rib cage			0
the cat ’s movements could be directed - left , right , straight ahead - with ultrasonic sound			0
the fate of the ‘ acoustic kitty ’ is n't clear as there were conflicting accounts about the project			0
ex-cia official @entity162 claimed in the book ‘ @entity164 ’ that the cat was run over by a taxi before his skills could be utilized			0
@entity84 , training a dolphin for the @entity57 , started @entity13 with his wife after working with acclaimed psychologist @entity99 ravens were another creature that @entity33 and the team found could be used for spying purposes			1
he recalled building a ‘ movie set ’ of the area around the @entity176 in @entity177 and then conditioning a raven , via a laser spotter , to pick out a particular room			0
@entity33 claims that both ravens and cats were successfully used to spy , but the program suffered a cut in funding following in 1975 after the @entity186 to @entity187 with @entity188 to @entity189 was formed to investigate abuses of power at several @entity1 intelligence agencies , including the @entity80			1
in more recent years , the work carried out by @entity33 and team at @entity13 has been overtaken by technology			1
' today , all you have to do is illuminate someone with an infrared laser and pick up the scatter back from that , and you can listen to their conversation without any trouble at all , ' he said			0
' you do n’t need a cat			0
' in the 1960s , the @entity13 was a tourist attraction for children who came to see the likes of ' the bunny photographer ' ( above ) , while behind the scenes experts worked on animals for other purposes for the @entity80			1

experts were being paid by the government during the 60s and 70s to investigate how animals could be used as spies
@entity33 , who worked at the @entity13 in @entity15 , has *revealed* that he helped train ravens to deposit and retrieve objects
cats were also taught how to eavesdrop on humans
funding for the research ended in the mid- 70s and spying nowadays uses advanced technology
