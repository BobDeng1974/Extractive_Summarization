by @entity0 for @entity1 as one of the quieter members of @entity5 , @entity2 does n't usually hit the headlines			1
but the claim that the pregnant singer is planning on eating her own placenta after giving birth to her fourth child later this year is guaranteed to catch a few people 's attention			1
@entity2 , 32 , is expecting her first daughter with @entity16 singer @entity15 , 34 , and after being told about the supposed health benefits , has decided she will get the body part made into pills to eat after the birth			1
' for those of you who have n’t heard about it , it is where your placenta is taken away after birth , it ’s dehydrated and ground into a coarse powder and then placed into small capsules to be taken as a daily supplement			2
' i was told this would help replace lost hormones more quickly , help to fight against post-natal depression ( @entity47 ) and also boosts milk supply			1
' the messy , gross side is taken away and you are given a daily vitamin , this appealed to me far more than adding raw placenta to a smoothie to be honest			0
the star , pictured here with her three sons ( pictured from left to right : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 claims to have suffered from severe @entity47 in a previous pregnancy ' and i did n’t fancy bringing my own placenta home in a @entity64 box and having to dry it out and chop it up myself ! ' as i ’ve suffered with severe @entity47 in the past and struggled with getting a good milk supply , i will take anything harmless if it prevents me getting @entity47 again			2
' the star is n't alone - actresses @entity72 and @entity73 has both admitted to eating their placenta after giving birth			0
in good company : @entity2 is n't the only celeb to be interested in eating placenta , both @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) also consumed it in pill form after the births of their children @entity73 said earlier this year : ' someone gifted me my placenta in the form of a pill , they encapsulate it			2
' i thought that 's harmless , i 'll try it			0
' and i have to tell you that i really loved it			0
" ' i 've got to the point that my husband said : " did you have your happy pills today ? '' ' and i was really sad when they were gone , it really helped me ' but the practice could soon be forbidden under new rules from the @entity101 , something that @entity2 is campaigning against			1
she wrote in her blog : ' the @entity101 is trying to class it as a “ novel food ” and in the process taking away our rights to nourish ourselves with something that has come from our own body			0
i understand that there are hygiene issues , but surely these companies that agree to take them away are fully aware of how to store a placenta ? ' i have followed this story closely and signed a petition with @entity117 that @entity118 have issued along with a lengthy dossier to the @entity101 and they are now awaiting a response on their final decision			0

@entity2 , 32 , is pregnant with her fourth child
the singer is hoping the nourishment will ward off @entity47
but the practice could be forbidden by the time she gives birth
