by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 25 june 2013 @entity1 was n't showing the strain of supporting @entity4 's number one tennis player as she arrived at @entity5 today to see him take victory in his first match			1
while @entity10 's mother @entity9 was seen earlier looking tried and grey , by contrast @entity1 looked happy and relaxed as she walked towards centre court with @entity15 's entourage			1
she carried a @entity17 handbag as she walked in heels wearing jeans and a cream blouse with an orange stripe down the front			0
what pressure ? @entity1 smiles broadly as she walks to centre court to watch her boyfriend stylish : the 25 year old wore a blue blazer and jeans as she carried her @entity17 handbag she topped her outfit off with a colourful blue blazer , a broad smile and perfectly blow dried hair			2
but despite her demeanor today , on the @entity35 documentary broadcast last night called @entity10 : @entity37 , when asked by @entity38 if she looked forward to @entity5 she replied with a laugh : ' no , i used to ! ' the 25 - year - old is usually seen to be on tenterhooks as @entity10 goes from round to round as the pressure for him to win on home turf is immense			2
last year he came painstakingly close to becoming the first @entity45 to win the title in decades as he made the final and won the first set , only to then be defeated by @entity49			0
he famously choked back tears as he gave a gallant loser speech while @entity1 was also seen looking tearful in the royal box			0
colourful : @entity1 teamed a blue blazer with a cream and orange blouse here we go again : @entity1 arrived in her seat in time to see @entity15 take to centre court again still smiling : @entity1 could relax as @entity15 won the first set and then the match one step closer : @entity1 applauds as her boyfriend 's quest to win @entity5 gets off to a good start @entity1 recalled of the heartbreaking moment : ' there were a lot of tears , it 's just horrible seeing someone you care about going through that			1
the immediate aftermath was n't pretty			0
' but since then she has seen her boyfriend go from strength to strength - winning @entity80 gold and silver medals and his first grand slam title in @entity82			0
@entity10 returned to centre court today to begin his campaign today against @entity86 's @entity85			1
confident start : @entity10 celebrates after staring the tournament with a win in straight sets relief : @entity92 had looked strained earlier in the day but broke into a smile after her son 's victory supporters : @entity97 and @entity98 have been following the centre court action all day and cheered @entity10 on on his match the tennis champ took to @entity102 ahead of his opener to express gratitude to his fans for their backing and encouragement			1
' i 'll give everything i have on the court starting with round 1 ' , he wrote			0
he was true to his word , beating the @entity86 in straight sets 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2			1
as well as @entity1 , also watching from the royal box was his ever present mother , @entity9 , and tennis fans @entity97 and @entity98			0
high hopes : once again the nation is behind @entity10 's bid to become @entity5 champ support : @entity1 told @entity38 that she does n't look forward to @entity5 and it was hard last year when her boyfriend was so upset by his loss in the final on yesterday 's @entity35 documentary @entity1 also revealed what it was like to be suddenly thrust into the lime light when he won his first tournament at @entity132 in 2006			2
she was a teenager still at school at the time and explained : ' i went away with him thinking it 's fine because he 's never going to win so i 'll be back in time for school on monday and then he did ! i remember saying to my mum , you 've got to call in and tell them i 've got the winter vomiting virus and i wo n't be in but then it was on the front cover of the paper so i was busted ! ' it was a weird for a few days after as i had photographers turning up at my school all the time but after that it calmed down			2

@entity4 's number one beat @entity85 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2
his *girlfriend* was smiling as she arrived on centre court
but she 's admitted she does n't look forward to @entity5
