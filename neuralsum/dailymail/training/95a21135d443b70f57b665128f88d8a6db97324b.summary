@entity24 , owner of @entity66 , first removed a crown atop the copper and gold - leaf lion 's head , cut cables holding the box in place inside the head , and removed the rectangular box , which weighed between five and 10 pounds and measured 8 - by - 12 inches in length and about 6 inches deep , according to @entity24			1
the society , which manages the @entity14 , first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great - great - granddaughter of @entity80 , a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion 's head and catalogued its contents			1
a 1901 article from the @entity86 surfaced later , alluding to contents of a copper box ' which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence			2

one of @entity22 's most popular tourist attractions , the @entity14 has a storied history			2
it was once the seat of @entity125 rule in the northern colonies , and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of @entity125 and @entity130			0

a 1901 article in the @entity86 reported on the original placement of the statue , as well as the box inside that has nbw been found : the work of the coppersmith is completed , and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box , which is placed in the head of the lion , and which contains contributions from state and city officials , the @entity22 daily newspapers , the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn , and others , which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years @entity201 source : @entity203 replaced wooden version : the copper lion and unicorn atop the building today replaced older wooden versions seen here in a lithograph that shows the reading of the @entity140			1
