@entity0 will be looking to prove he can still be the force he once was against two of golf 's young rising stars when the @entity5 gets under way on thursday in @entity7			1
@entity0 will be making yet another comeback from injury at @entity10 in his first event of the 2015 season and first tournament since he finished joint last at the @entity15 in december			1
he will play the first two days paired with 21 - year - old world no 9 @entity18 and 15th - ranked @entity17 , 24 - the two players who probably left @entity20 with the most credit after the @entity24 ' third straight @entity23 loss last year			1
@entity0 will compete in his first tournament of the year at the @entity5 in @entity7 @entity0 says he is driving better than ever and feels confident in his technique @entity0 was all smiles as he addressed the media after a practice round in @entity10 on tuesday @entity0 could not compete in @entity30 as he continued to recover from the effects of back surgery , but the 39 - year - old is confident those problems are behind him			1
and @entity0 also believes his driving , which was notably erratic even at his peak and has been put in the shade by the game 's new big - hitters , is as strong as when he last played this event 14 years ago			1
' my driving has come around a lot faster , ' he told a press conference			0
' i 'm a lot longer than i thought i ever could be again			0
my speed is way back up , and that 's fun			0
i 'm touching numbers that i did 15 years ago , so that 's cool			2
' he added : ' i 'm driving it			0
it felt great , driving my ball			0
' @entity0 ' disappointing week at the @entity15 was notable for his poor chipping , and the 14 - time major winner feels he has now adjusted to his new methods with swing consultant @entity59			1
@entity0 says he has adjusted to a new chipping technique after working with new coach @entity59 woods gestures as he goes around the @entity10 during a practice round ' i was caught between techniques , between my old release pattern and body movement when i was working with @entity66 ( @entity67 ) and then my new release pattern , ' he added			1
' we had to basically just hit thousands upon thousands upon thousands of chips and just get it out of there , and now it 's better			0
' @entity0 was clearly more relaxed facing the media in the desert than he often is and , while he seemed confident , he admitted he had some obstacles to overcome over the 7,152 - yard lay - out			2
' i think i need to work on a little bit here , getting the speed of these greens , because in your head , you assume hard greens with a lot of spring to them are going to be fast , but they 're not fast , ' he said			2
' they spring , but they putt slow			0
so i need to do some work to try to overcome the mental hurdle to make sure i can hit the putts hard , even though i know coming into the greens i have to throw the ball straight up in the air , play for a big hop , chips , play for two big hops before the ball starts thinking about stopping			2
' @entity17 ( in action at the @entity98 ) will partner @entity0 at the @entity5 @entity99 will play in his first tournament since his alleged kidnapping and beating in @entity102 woods may be the main attraction at @entity10 , but he will have competition from a strong field including world no 4 @entity107 , last week 's @entity98 winner @entity109 and @entity111 champion @entity110			1
defending champion @entity112 will not be playing due to a wrist injury , but @entity99 returns to action following his alleged kidnapping and beating in @entity102 , and the notoriously raucous crowds will be backing @entity118 alumnus @entity117			0
@entity119 and @entity120 lead the @entity122 charge , with @entity30 duo @entity123 and @entity124 , @entity126 's @entity125 and @entity128 veteran @entity127 also in the field .			0
