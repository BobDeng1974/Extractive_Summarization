by @entity0 forget @entity2 , smartwatches and even the biohacker who inserted a microchip under his skin , @entity1 is hoping to trump them all with its microphone tattoo			1
according to a patent filed by the @entity13 - owned phone maker , the tattoo would be placed onto a person ’s throat and pick sounds created by their voice			1
if the user is making a phone call , the tattoo would then send these sounds wirelessly to the smartphone and the caller			1
according to a patent submitted by @entity13 - owned @entity1 , the firm also has plans for electronic tattoos , illustration pictured , that could be used to read fluctuations of muscle or tissue in the throat and register what the wearer was saying			1
these plans could be a step towards microchips in brains the tattoo ’s built - in microphone would pick up the sounds made by a person ’s voice by reading vibrations and fluctuations of muscle or tissue from their voicebox			2
if the user is making a phone call , the tattoo would then send these sounds wirelessly to the smartphone , and the caller			1
@entity1 said the tattoo would either contain a battery that ‘ may or may not be rechargeable ’ , or alternatively , could be powered by an @entity56 or @entity57 charging device			1
the patent added : ‘ it is contemplated the electronic tattoo can also be applied to an animal			2
’ the patent is called ‘ coupling an electronic skin tattoo to a mobile communication device ’ and was originally filed in may last year			0
throughout the patent , @entity1 calls the device ‘ electronic tattoo 110 ’ and said it would ‘ comprise audio circuitry that enables reception of acoustic signals from a person 's throat ’			1
put simply , the tattoo ’s built - in microphone could pick up the sounds made by a person ’s voice by reading vibrations and fluctuations of muscle or tissue from their voicebox			2
it continues that the tattoo would either contain a battery that ‘ may or may not be rechargeable ’ , or alternatively , could be powered by an @entity56 or @entity57 charging device			1
the patent addedsaid : ‘ it is contemplated that the electronic tattoo 110 can also be applied to an animal as well			0
’ @entity1 is set to release its new @entity90 handset on 13 november , a leaked image of the phone is pictured , and some analysts believe the software may be updated to work with devices such as the neck tattoo			2
a release date for the tattoo has not been announced explaining the reason behind the plans , @entity1 said : ' mobile communication devices are often operated in noisy environments			1
' large stadiums , busy streets , restaurants , and emergency situations can be extremely loud and include varying frequencies of acoustic noise			0
' communication can reasonably be improved and even enhanced with a method and system for reducing the acoustic noise in such environments and contexts			0
' @entity1 is set to release its new @entity90 handset on 13 november and some analysts believe the software may be updated to work with devices such as the neck tattoo , yet a release date for the tattoo has not been announced			2
as with all patents , the submission does n't guarantee the technology will ever be available			0
@entity1 announced in may this year it was looking to replace traditional passwords with electronic tattoos or authentication pills that people swallow			1
the neck tattoo is n't the first time @entity1 has discussed the wearable technology			1
@entity1 's senior vice president of advance research @entity131 , showed off an electronic tattoo at the @entity135 conference in may , pictured , designed as an alternative to traditional passwords speaking at the @entity135 conference , @entity1 's senior vice president of advance research @entity131 showed off a tattoo , developed by @entity142 - based engineering firm @entity140 , that contains flexible electronic circuits attached to the wearer 's skin			1
she claimed these circuits , which also contain antennae and built - in sensors , could be adapted to work with mobile phones and tablets			0
the mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner 's identity and log them in to accounts automatically			0
this would prevent thieves and other people from being able to access a phone , or individual apps on the device , if it is stolen or lost			0
another password - alternative presented by @entity1 at the @entity166 's @entity135 conference was the ' vitamin authentication pill '			2
it contains a computer chip that creates an 18 - bit signal when swallowed			0
@entity1 is testing whether this signal can ' talk ' to mobile phones and be used to authenticate a wearer 's identity another idea presented during the keynote talk at the @entity166 conference was a swallowable pill			2
the @entity179 pill has already been approved by the @entity180 and was given @entity182 regulatory approval in 2010			0
it contains a computer chip that can be powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer 's stomach			0
once swallowed the ' vitamin authentication pill ' creates an 18 - bit @entity191 - like signal inside the wearer 's body that can be picked up by mobile devices and authentication hardware outside			0
this could be used verify the wearer is the correct owner of the device or account .			0

tattoo picks up sounds caused by changes in throat muscles when talking
it sends these sounds wirelessly to a smartphone using @entity57 or @entity56
@entity13 - owned @entity1 also claims it could be *fitted* to animals
the technology could make it easier to hear callers in noisy places
the firm has also said it is working on tattoos to replace passwords
