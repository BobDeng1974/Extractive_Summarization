by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 4 october 2013 a three - year - old girl who has spent her entire life in hospital as a result of a rare condition which means she can not breathe on her own is preparing to go home for the first time @entity8 suffers from @entity9 which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe , a condition which previously made it impossible for her to leave @entity13			1
however , thanks to a new portable ventilator , @entity8 will be able to leave the hospital and go home to her family in @entity19 , @entity20			1
@entity21 : @entity8 , pictured with her parents @entity23 , 23 , and @entity24 , 26 , is set to go home for the first time on monday after spending all her life in hospital the @entity30 fan requires 24 - hour ventilator treatment for the rare condition , which is medically know as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( @entity9 ) , which sees her brain fail to send the vital messages to her lungs and muscles to tell her to breathe			1
her brain fails to send the correct messages telling her to breathe but @entity8 also suffers from malacia of the airways - ‘ floppy ’ airways that do not hold their shape properly			1
now , @entity8 , who also suffers from malacia of the airways , can look forward to a future outside of @entity13 and hopefully be able to go to a normal school in the future			1
@entity13 staff held a going - home party on @entity48 yesterday to celebrate the little girl ’s bravery as @entity8 , who celebrates her third birthday this month , gets ready to move out on monday			1
her mother @entity23 , 23 , said : ‘ we can not wait to bring @entity54 home and enjoy being a normal family			0
it ’s felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime			0
happy ending : after spending all her life at @entity13 , staff threw @entity8 a leaving party to celebrate her new portable ventilator and to say goodbye normal life : @entity8 has never played with other children and her parents hope that she will be able to make new friends as she joins a local nursery int heir home town of @entity19 , @entity20 ‘ everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know @entity8 inside out			1
‘ she knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl			0
she ’s hardly ever upset			0
i do n’t think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time			2
‘ our friends and family have helped us decorate the house and get it ready for her			0
we ’ve painted her bedroom cream and we have got some lovely stick - on stencils for the walls			0
’ the new ventilator is intelligent enough to know when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a @entity9 episode and require ventilation			0
ms @entity23 , who suffers from a less complex form of @entity9 , and @entity8 ’s father @entity24 , 26 , have been fully trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers			2
the couple have mostly been living in hospital accommodation ever since @entity8 was transferred to @entity13 from @entity101 when she was three months old			1
they have taken it in turns to make the hour - and - a - half journey back to their home			0
as a result of her condition @entity8 , who loves @entity30 and playing @entity111 on her father ’s @entity112 , has hardly spent any time with other children			1
her parents now hope she will be able to mix with other youngsters at nursery			0
family curse : @entity8 's mother @entity23 suffers from a less complex form of the condition which has blighted her daughter 's life mr @entity24 said : ‘ she will have to get used to lots of new faces as she only really sees close family and her nurses			1
‘ hopefully she will soon learn to share her toys and play with other children			0
’ dr @entity130 , a consultant in respiratory paediatrics at @entity13 , is working with a number of children requiring long - term ventilation , including @entity8 , to allow them to spend more time at home with their families			1
he also treated ms @entity23 when she was younger			0
he said : ‘ @entity8 ’s situation is quite complex because she has a combination of different respiratory conditions , but we are hopeful this new technology will allow her to go home , be with her family and start enjoying a fuller , more normal life			2
‘ we have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long - term ventilated children to go home - not only because it greatly enhances their quality of life , but also because it ’s much better for their development			2
‘ the family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop , and @entity8 will now be able to go out and about with her family , make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer			2
’ dr @entity130 said @entity9 can run in families but added : ‘ it is incredibly unusual to see two generations affected by it like this			0
‘ @entity8 ’s condition is more severe than her mother ’s and is also complicated by the additional problem of malacia of the airways			2

@entity8 , 3 , has lived at @entity13 her entire life
rare condition means her brain forgets to tell her body to breathe
thanks to portable ventilator she will now to go home for the first time
