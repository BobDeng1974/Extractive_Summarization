@entity0 , 67 , sold hundreds of vintage and modern police uniforms to film studios and tv companies including the @entity4 and @entity5 a police uniform trader who sold helmets and truncheons to the @entity4 , @entity5 and prestigious theatres has been prosecuted after being unable to prove they were not being bought by potential terrorists			1
@entity0 , 67 , provided hundreds of vintage and modern police uniforms for film studios and even sold helmets to the @entity16 in @entity17 for a number of productions			1
the trader from @entity21 , @entity22 , was found guilty on eight counts of illegally possessing items of police clothing under the @entity26 and was fined £ 250 at @entity27			1
his appeal was quashed last week after a judge ruled he had not properly vetted the people he sold the items to and he was ordered to pay a further £ 300			1
police raided his home last year and seized 236 helmets , 56 baseball caps and 92 helmet badges worth more than £ 10,000			1
mr @entity0 's solicitor @entity37 warned that this landmark case could open the floodgates for similar prosecutions against theatres and tv shows like @entity43			1
speaking after his conviction , mr @entity0 said he was ' incredibly frustrated ' because he supplied the uniforms to the entertainment industry rather than potential criminals			1
' their argument was that i did n't know who i was selling to but i did know			0
i sell mostly to theatres and film and tv companies , ' he said			2
' for example , we sold helmets to the @entity16 of @entity57 for their production of @entity59 because they wanted policeman from the miners ' strike in the 1980s			2
' i also sold some tunics and helmets to the set of a film featuring @entity67 , as well as to the @entity4 and @entity5 and the @entity16 in @entity17			1
' of course i sell to individuals but i always talk to them and i know what they want them for			0
' most of the stock was historic , a lot of it dating back to the 1970s and relating to now - defunct police forces like the @entity75			0
' i trade in a lot of cap badges which are mostly silver and not enamel like the ones used today			0
' but now i have been convicted it is case law and i suppose other traders are liable for prosecution			0
' ' anybody who has got a police uniform that has not been authorised by the police could be prosecuted			0
' mr @entity0 's solicitor @entity37 warned that this landmark case could open the floodgates for similar prosecutions against theatres and tv shows like @entity43 ( pictured ) mr @entity0 revealed he had sold to most of the theatres in @entity93 including the @entity16 in @entity17 he sourced the products from @entity95 , the @entity96 and a specialist wholesale firm and sold them for use as props and to known collectors in the @entity101			1
mr @entity0 sold the items online and from his shop @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 , which closed down in august			1
@entity106 , representing @entity0 at the appeal hearing , tried to argue that his client did not have a responsibility to monitor his buyers and that the @entity26 was aimed at people caught in possession of police equipment in suspicious circumstances			1
he said : ' did he intend to do something with these items that was illegal ? as he clearly stated at interview , he did not			0
' but a judge ruled that he had not taken adequate steps to ensure his buyers were reputable			1
judge @entity120 said the @entity26 was intended ' for the protection of the public ' and ' the maintenance of the integrity of the police service '			2
he said the nature of @entity0 's business was such that he could not and that he had not taken steps to warn his customers of their legal obligations			2
mr @entity0 said he is now planning to take the matter to the @entity131 as long as he could secure the funding			2
his solicitor mr @entity37 said : ' anybody who has got a police uniform that has not been authorised by the police could be prosecuted			0
' all sorts of people have police uniforms for the purposes of fooling members of the public			1
' when you watch heartbeat there are people in uniforms designed to fool the watching public			0
' many of the items that mr @entity0 had came from museums and other items came from various websites like @entity95			1
' if he is guilty then it stands to reason that all these other people must be guilty as well			0
' we are surprised that the police have n't yet gone after these people , it does n't make sense			0
if he is doing wrong than the others must be doing the same thing			0
' the @entity163 suggested certain people are authorised to have uniforms but we can not find any law or act where you get that authorisation			0
' it seems the @entity163 went after mr @entity0 to try and a test case			2
' of course they are worried about people impersonating police officers but there are separate laws that deal with that			0
' there is no case law for this so mr @entity0 's case is a first			2
