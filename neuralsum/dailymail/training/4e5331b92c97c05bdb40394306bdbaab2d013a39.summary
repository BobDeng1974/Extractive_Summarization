@entity0 have n’t scored for four games , and they have scored only one goal in their last six outings in the @entity4			1
their tally of just 11 goals in 21 games so far this season is pathetic – it ’s comfortably the lowest total in the @entity4 and it ’s less than half the number @entity11 have managed			1
losing 1 - 0 at @entity12 on saturday was as bad as it gets for @entity0			1
they created virtually nothing , the fans booed them at half - time and full - time , chanted for @entity20 to go and told the manager he did n’t know what he was doing			1
@entity0 and @entity12 players clash in saturday 's @entity4 match at the @entity25 @entity20 is under pressure as his @entity0 side continue to slide down the @entity4 table @entity0 is one of @entity31 ’s finest football clubs			1
the leading representative of @entity31 ’s second city , they have reigned supreme at home and in @entity35 in the past and have a stadium that is the envy of many			0
but on the pitch right now they ’re useless			0
if the fans are expecting a return to the @entity43 days when @entity0 challenged ( albeit in vain ) for a top - four place , then that ’s optimism gone mad			1
@entity43 left because he did n’t want to work within financial restrictions imposed by owner @entity48			1
@entity20 has taken the job on , occasionally he has got @entity0 playing some decent stuff but those games have been too infrequent , and right now they are non-existent			1
@entity52 , battling with @entity53 , has everything a top striker needs ... other than his finishing @entity0 striker @entity57 looks like a player who does n't want to be at the club @entity0 should n’t be contenders at the top , but they should n’t be this bad			1
fans fear a relegation fight and with good reason			2
i believe @entity20 is a good manager who has lost his way			0
fielding a midfield three of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 against a team bottom of the table with only one home win all season is shameful			0
i ’m a fan of @entity77 as a holding midfielder , there ’s a hint of @entity80 about him			0
but in terms of invention and creation there is nothing			0
further forward , @entity88 looks like he ’s retired already , @entity87 ’s progress has halted , @entity57 looks like he wants to be at another club while @entity52 has everything a top striker needs – except that he ’s a terrible finisher			0
@entity0 fans will be expecting a return to the @entity43 days where they challenged the top four elsewhere , contracts for top players are running out			1
@entity99 and @entity100 will both have to leave in this window if @entity0 want to make any money from them			1
take those two out of this squad and @entity0 are staring down the barrel of the @entity106			1
@entity20 is working within the confines of the financial equivalent of a gastric band set to its tightest , so i have some sympathy			0
fat chance of @entity0 returning to glory in these circumstances			1
but he is n’t helping himself at all			0
his teams have no enterprise , and are definitely not exciting to watch			0
there does n’t even seem to be an intention to entertain the fans			2
losing is never good , but fans would be more willing to forgive if you were trying to do something positive			2
but losing while stinking the place out is harder to accept so that ’s why @entity20 is getting relentless grief from the fans			0
@entity100 is being courted by @entity128 and @entity0 may be tempted to cash in on the defender this month the @entity0 story should be so different			2
from the ownership of the club downwards , @entity0 should be forward - thinking , progressive and successful			2
@entity0 need an owner who can grab hold of the club and drag it back to where it should be			2
for a bright owner and for a dynamic manager there is the chance to achieve something special and memorable at a big club like @entity0			2
but nobody wants to seize that opportunity it seems			0
@entity0 fans should be mixing it with @entity151 and @entity152 just like they used to			1
right now they ’re looking more likely to be slumming it with @entity154 in the second tier of @entity31 football			0
sad times at @entity158 .			0

@entity0 have failed to score in their last four outings
they *'ve* scored 11 in 21 games ... less than half the number @entity11 have
fans are expecting a return to the days under former boss @entity43
but right now they are heading for the *championship*
