@entity2 yesterday confirmed that @entity3 will replace @entity4 at the @entity5 following the latter ’s dramatic decision to step down on monday night			1
mr @entity3 , 58 , is one of the few senior @entity17 to publicly state he would vote to leave the @entity9 unless it reforms			1
other prominent eurosceptics receiving promotions included mr @entity3 ’s successor as @entity22 , @entity23 , and new environment secretary @entity24			2
the appointment of mr @entity3 , who is close to home secretary @entity26 , will also make him a major player in the eventual contest to replace mr @entity6 as @entity30 leader			1
but the main focus yesterday was on what the appointment signals about mr @entity6 ’s approach to negotiations with @entity35 ahead of a promised in / out referendum on @entity37 in 2017			2
@entity39 , director of the respected @entity41 think - tank , said the @entity46 had ‘ clearly taken a more @entity12 turn ’ , adding that mr @entity3 ‘ undoubtedly has a higher threshold than @entity4 ’ for what would be a good deal for @entity7			1
mr @entity39 said : ‘ having a figure who has said that reform must be substantial for him to back an “ in ” will add credibility to their election campaign and help win back voters who have left to vote for @entity51			0
‘ it ’s fair to say mr @entity3 is the most @entity12 @entity30 foreign secretary since @entity13 declared war in 1939			1
’ former @entity30 minister @entity57 welcomed the appointment : ‘ he ’s clearly much more of an overt @entity12 and the whole story post-the - 2015 - election is going to be about renegotiation with @entity37 ahead of a referendum			0
same policy : @entity4 rejected the theory that naming mr @entity3 as his successor marked a more @entity12 approach from the @entity17 ‘ @entity4 has done a fantastic job , one of the best @entity69 , but has not been as outspoken on @entity12 as many perhaps would like him to be			1
’ but mr @entity4 rejected the theory that naming mr @entity3 as his successor marked a more @entity12 approach from the @entity17			1
he said : ‘ we are very clear and united on @entity37			0
@entity3 , @entity6 and i all have exactly the same policy on @entity37			2
‘ we want to improve @entity7 ’s relationship with the @entity9 and then hold a referendum on staying in or leaving the @entity9			2
’ last year mr @entity3 said he would vote to leave the @entity9 ‘ if the choice is between a @entity9 written exactly as it is today and not being a part of that ’			1
but yesterday he attempted to play down his doubts about @entity35 , saying he believes @entity7 can achieve an acceptable deal from the @entity9			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ i ’m going to focus on making sure that we get a successful renegotiation with our @entity37 partners			0
i do n’t think the way to enter a negotiation is to start issuing threats			0
the way to enter a negotiation is to look for the areas where we do agree			0
‘ there are many issues where @entity7 is not isolated , where there are other members of the @entity9 that also understand the need for reform and particularly understand the need for reform to allow the @entity100 and the @entity102 part of @entity37 to be able to work together			2
‘ i believe it will be possible to renegotiate significant change to the way the @entity9 works			0
’ mr @entity3 is seen by the prime minister as a safe pair of hands and was instrumental in tackling the disastrous finances of the @entity110			0
but his cheese - paring approach was unpopular with some members of the military top brass			0
mr @entity3 will be plunged immediately into a series of international crises , including the bloody civil wars in @entity117 and @entity118 , the renewed fighting in @entity120 and the continuing @entity122 threats against @entity123 .			0
