by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 06:02 est , 5 september 2013 a school principal has apologised after @entity4 pupils were inadvertently fed bacon when a box of sandwich spread was wrongly labelled as halal chicken and sweetcorn			1
@entity11 , the executive principal of @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , formally apologised for the mix up on the school 's website , putting it down to ' human error '			1
a former teacher pointed out the mistake after eating one of the baguettes herself at the school where more than 50 per cent of pupils are from ethnic minorities			1
@entity4 pupils at @entity12 in @entity14 unwittingly ate the bacon after picking up baguettes labelled as halal chicken and sweetcorn the principal posted a statement of apology on the school 's website , saying it is ' nationally and internationally acknowledged as a high achieving , innovative and exciting school which recognises and celebrates the diversity of its community			1
' the halal food error was discovered by a @entity4 teacher who had bought one of the baguettes at lunch in july , during the last week of term before the summer break			1
the teacher , who has now left the school , said : ' all the halal food is meant to be labelled clearly as halal and i took what i believed was a halal chicken and sweetcorn baguette			1
' but after eating it i became aware of a smoky smell and taste			1
as i looked inside i was horrified to find that there were pieces of what i thought were ham			0
' she approached catering staff who confirmed the mislabelled baguette contained bacon			0
the statement on the school 's website highlights its culturally diverse student body , apologising for the ' unfortunate mistake ' which ms @entity73 later put down to ' human error ' ' i felt physically repulsed , terribly upset			1
i had never eaten pork before and could n’t believe i was eating it by mistake at school , ' the teacher said			2
' i had taken the last baguette so all the others and the sandwiches with the same filler in would have been eaten by the pupils , many of whom are @entity4			1
' this means pupils were therefore not only given non-halal chicken , but were also given bacon , a meat that is clearly forbidden in @entity92 and is not supposed to be anywhere near the lips of a @entity4			2
