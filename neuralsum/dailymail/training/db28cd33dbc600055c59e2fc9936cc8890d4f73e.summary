@entity1 's ' @entity0 ' is to undergo a few design tweaks after a successful maiden track test in @entity4			1
@entity5 ran the led display system on top of one of their cars on the second day of the final two - day test of the season at the @entity13			1
using information provided from race control , the aim of the concept is to provide to the viewing public positional data , along with other information such as tyre strategy and on - track flag condition			0
the @entity0 was tested by @entity5 in @entity4 , it was placed above the driver 's head the test at least highlighted to @entity1 , whose son @entity26 was crowned @entity28 world champion for a second time last sunday , where areas of modification are required			1
@entity1 said : ' as i suspected the bright sunlight made it a bit difficult to see the leds when the cars were out on track			1
' in the garage it looked like it was going to be bright enough , and at particular points on the circuit it looked bright enough			2
' but we 're probably going to need to change the @entity35 , make them slightly larger and slightly brighter			0
problems appeared when it proved difficult to see the led lights in the bright sunshine ' overall ( @entity5 ) thought it looked quite good and think it 's going to work well if we can just brighten it up slightly			1
' you can do as much testing here in the @entity53 you think is viable , but obviously we do n't have the bright sunshine like in @entity4			1
' nevertheless it was a good test , and it bodes well for the new version			0
' the next version of the system will incorporate a new - shaped camera mount and a double - led display showing not only race position data , but also the first three letters of a driver 's surname			0
the technology will be able to display a variety of information once it is fully operational ' based on the feedback we 're going to be designing the new unit right now , and i hope to have the new circuit board ready in the next three weeks , ' added @entity1 ' i 'm going to persevere with it because based on the story that emerged last week there has been a huge amount of interest			2
' people love the idea , although of course there are the die - hard fans who say ' we understand racing , we do n't need that '			0
' but it 's not just for the die - hard fans , it 's for fans generally			0
' @entity1 is currently awaiting feedback from the sport 's world governing body the @entity87 .			2

the ' info wing ' was tested in @entity4 by @entity5
@entity1 *admitted* that tweaks needed to be made to the design
the led lights proved difficult to see in the bright sunlight
