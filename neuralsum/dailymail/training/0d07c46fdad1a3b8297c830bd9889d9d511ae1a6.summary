by @entity0 and @entity1 a retired @entity2 with nearly two decades of aviation experience has stepped forward with a compelling theory about a mysterious plane that was spotted flying over @entity6 last month			1
on march 10 , photographers @entity7 and @entity9 took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over @entity12 , and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes			0
retired - @entity2 @entity15 has submitted one of the more interesting explanations , telling the @entity18 he believes they are @entity19 - a spy plane that can cross the @entity21 in less than an hour , unmanned			1
the triangle over @entity6 : two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over @entity6 last month mystery solved ? a retired @entity2 says the plane pictured in @entity12 last month is the @entity27 - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour the mystery aircraft seen over @entity12 on march 10			1
three of the craft were spotted flying by in 1956 , @entity34 magazines started getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the @entity37 , then operating out of @entity38 on its first spy flights over the @entity40 - marking the first sight of a stealth plane that government 's had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes			1
it provided day and night , very high - altitude ( 70,000 feet / 21,000 m ) , all - weather intelligence gathering			0
@entity15 spent 17 years as a @entity2 and also worked with a jet squadron in @entity49			2
he says the @entity50 may have dispatched the planes to the @entity52 to aide in the search for missing @entity55			0
but @entity7 , who saw the planes himself , does n't agree			0
' the @entity57 is still in development , ' he said tuesday			2
' plus it 's a high - speed , high - @entity60 plane			2
these were going airliner speed			0
they were not in a hurry to get anywhere			0
' the @entity57 is currently being developed by @entity67 in @entity68 , and according to the company 's website they say the plane could be operational as early as 2030			1
it is the predecessor of the @entity73 which broke speed records when it flew from @entity77 to @entity78 in less than two hours in 1976			0
@entity67 's @entity80 program manager @entity79 wrote that the plane is designed to ' strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour			1
' ' speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades			0
the technology would be a game - changer in theater , similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today , ' @entity79 said			2
another source told the @entity18 that the plane was a @entity95 , but the two photographers discovered that no b - 2s were flying in the country that day the @entity57 is a successor to the @entity73 which broke speed records when it flew from @entity77 to @entity101 in less than two hours in 1976 another reader who wished not to be identified told the @entity18 with confidence that ' it 's a b - 2 stealth bomber flying out of @entity105 in @entity106			1
' that 's what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of aircraft , but they say they checked with the base and no b - 2s were flying anywhere in the @entity21 that day			0
instead , @entity7 believes that the planes are a no type of spy plane - a stealth transport plane that could sneak troops into a another country unseen .			1

a retired @entity2 says the mysterious plane is an @entity57 - a *super-fast* spy plane currently in development
the @entity57 is designed to cross entire continents in less than an hour , unmanned
developers at @entity67 say the plane could be operational by 2030
the man who photographed the plane does n't believe it 's an @entity57 but rather a stealth transport plane
