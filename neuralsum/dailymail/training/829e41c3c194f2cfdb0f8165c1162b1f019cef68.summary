by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:56 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 8 january 2013 reforms to stop elderly people having to sell their homes to pay for care will be passed into law before 2015 , @entity2 revealed today			1
the deputy prime minister sought to diffuse growing anger about coalition delays in overhauling the social care system , two years after a commission called for a cap on the amount individuals are expected to pay			0
the move comes amid warnings that elderly people have suffered ‘ an abominable betrayal ’ over social care			1
every year , at least 20,000 people have to sell their homes to pay for care but the coalition is to legislate to cap costs in the future the coalition ’s @entity26 , published yesterday , did little to suggest any progress was likely to be made soon			2
but mr @entity2 today told mps the government would ‘ enshrine ’ in law the principle of capping care costs , with the taxpayers picking up the rest of the tab			1
under @entity41 ’s current system , pensioners with assets of £ 23,500 or more – including the value of their homes – have to pay unlimited care charges			2
it means that every year , at least 20,000 have to sell their homes to pay for care			0
deputy pm @entity2 revealed the government would legislate before 2015 two years ago an independent commission led by economist @entity47 suggested these charges should be subject to a lifetime cap of around £ 35,000 , with the state paying the rest			1
the measure is designed to stop pensioners being forced to sell their homes to cover costs			2
it is understood the coalition is likely to opt for a cap of around £ 75,000			1
mr @entity2 revealed the government will set out legislation on introducing a cap within weeks which ‘ will address this issue of how to avoid individuals and households facing catastrophic costs in funding their care ’			1
speaking in the @entity66 he added : ‘ we have said all along that we believe in the principles and basic models set out by @entity47			0
‘ of course there is an issue about how we pay for this in future , but as you quite rightly identify the first step is to enshrine this approach in legislation which we will be seeking to do during this parliament			2
’ @entity80 opposition to a multi-billion pound reform of the care system has been blamed for the lack of progress to date			2
last week care minister @entity85 pleaded with the chancellor @entity86 to ‘ get on with it ’			2
‘ my absolute determination is to get the principle in legislation so we have that debate rather than it remaining in the long grass , ’ he told @entity1			1
it came after his predecessor , @entity95 , suggested curbing the winter fuel allowance for all but the poorest pensioners to raise £ 1.5billion - a - year to help pay for the reforms			0
in the @entity66 today , mr @entity95 said the @entity26 only committed to the principles of a cap and reform of means - testing ‘ to end the care lottery that we have in this country ’			0
he called on mr @entity2 to ‘ now go further than just looking at principles and commit the government to introducing the legislation during the life of this parliament … to give people the peace of mind they deserve ’			1
meanwhile professor @entity113 , incoming president of the @entity114 , said the generation who established the welfare system were being let down by a lack of funding			0
the number of elderly people receiving daycare from their councils has fallen by nearly a quarter since 2009 ‘ the elderly are frightened of what is going to happen to them			0
there is a debt of honour we owe the elderly			0
’ they fought in @entity132 or contributed to the war effort and wanted to create a secure environment that came to be known as the welfare state which is now being portrayed as dependants and layabouts			0
it is an abominable betrayal , ’ he told the @entity140			1
‘ social care has to be properly funded and all parties are avoiding this issue			0
without proper funding we are going to have more and more care scandals			0
’ yesterday prime minister @entity147 insisted that the coalition government would set out reforms to cap " the potentially huge cost " of social care , but prof @entity113 claimed ministers were ‘ fiddling while @entity154 burns ’ .			1

@entity2 reveals legislation will be introduced in this @entity157
@entity159 *recommended* capping costs at £ *32,000* but ministers likely to opt for £ 75,000 limit
@entity164 accuses ministers of ' abominable betrayal ’
