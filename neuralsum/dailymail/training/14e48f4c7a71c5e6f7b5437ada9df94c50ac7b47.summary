but @entity1 's afternoon was cut short after he came to a halt at turn four with an oil - pressure problem with 30 minutes of the session remaining			1
it meant @entity1 completed 14 laps , crucially 21 fewer than his rival @entity11			1

it 's not ideal but we 'll recover			0
' @entity11 meanwhile was dealt a boost in his title ambitions after he escaped punishment for passing @entity51 's @entity50 under red flags following @entity54 's huge shunt in the opening session			1
the @entity56 was called to see the stewards , but they opted to take no further action			1
the stewards stated in their decision that @entity60 's speed had dropped to just 24mph which contributed to their ruling			0
' having reviewed data from several cars in the same area of the track , several angles of video and having spoken to the driver concerned , the stewards determined that : the driver of car 6 had driven the lap fully within the regulations and was travelling at a safe and reasonable speed throughout , ' an @entity66 statement read			0
' at the moment of the overtake , car 26 pulled fully off line and slowed to as low as 38kph in what appeared to be a very unusual manner , in an area of the track that was visibly completely clear ; and that the driver of car 6 took reasonable avoiding action of a car			0

it is the third time this year that @entity11 has escaped punishment following an investigation by the stewards			1
he was cleared in @entity157 after running off the track during qualifying and thus thwarting @entity1 's best shot at pole position			2
