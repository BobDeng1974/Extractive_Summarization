senior @entity1 figures piled pressure on @entity3 over his row with @entity6 business last night , with one of the party ’s biggest donors claiming it is ‘ in danger of promoting communism ’			1
and in a separate attack , former minister @entity13 accused his party ’s leadership of a ‘ terrible , neglectful ’ attitude to its relations with captains of industry			1
mr @entity13 , who worked in the @entity20 as paymaster general alongside mr @entity3 , then an adviser to @entity22 , insisted : ‘ the mood music is wrong			1
i do n’t know how it ’s happened but it needs to be corrected			0
they are still @entity1 , all the policies , all the statements on business			2
if they [ the shadow @entity38 ] have n’t given that impression it ’s a terrible , neglectful omission on their part			1
‘ we have got to engage			0
we are not anti-business , we are not anti-trade union			0
we are for both of them			0
’ @entity27 , the @entity47 - born entrepreneur and owner of @entity28 , who donated £ 110,000 to labour as recently as last june , accused the party of treating successful businessmen as if ‘ they should go away and die ’			1
‘ i create wealth , exports and jobs			0
what ’s wrong with that ? @entity1 is promoting socialism – and they ’re in danger of promoting communism , ’ dr @entity27 said			1
lord noon , another prominent donor , who is now a @entity1 peer , criticised @entity65 ’ inability this week to recall a single business supporter ’s name as well as mr @entity3 ’s failure to mention the deficit in his conference speech last year			1
‘ i cringed when @entity65 forgot the name of a business backer and @entity3 forgot whole paragraphs from his conference speech			1
it is very embarrassing , ’ he said			0
he suggested the @entity1 leader and the @entity80 should ‘ eat almonds ’ – said to improve memory – ‘ every day so they remember things when they speak in public ’			0
piling on the pressure : former minister @entity13 ( pictured left with @entity3 ) accused his party ’s leadership of a ‘ terrible , neglectful ’ attitude to its relations with captains of industry sir @entity88 , founder of @entity89 and one of 63 business figures who signed a letter supporting @entity1 in 2005 , said he was ‘ frightened ’ by the idea of the party winning may ’s general election			1
the business community felt ‘ isolated ’ by @entity1 ’s shift to the left , he warned			0
‘ as a business person i ’m frightened of an environment where there is n’t sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts , ’ he said			0
‘ it feels like we have gone back to old @entity1 and business people feel very detached from the party			1
’ mr @entity3 has announced a series of policies taking aim at what he calls capitalist ‘ predators ’ across a range of industries from energy suppliers to private landlords			2
the latest row began at the weekend , when the @entity1 leader went to war with @entity123 chief executive @entity122 after he expressed concern at the prospect of the party winning the election			2
@entity1 criticised mr @entity122 as a tax avoider and raised allegations about the tax affairs of the chain , which has 2,500 stores and 70,000 staff in @entity6			2
his stance appears to have backfired badly , prompting other business leaders to join a chorus of warnings about @entity1 ’s plans			0
mr @entity3 was defiant last night , insisting the row had revealed ‘ a truth about our country ’			1
‘ it was five days which showed the two different paths for @entity6			2
the conservatives believe that when a few at the top succeed , the country succeeds , ’ he said in an interview with the @entity144			0
‘ we think a country succeeds with an economy based on a different idea , that it is only when working people succeed that @entity6 succeeds			2
’ mr @entity13 said a warning from former @entity160 boss @entity159 that mr @entity3 is a ‘ @entity162 throwback ’ who is ‘ blowing apart ’ @entity6 ’s pro-business consensus in an article for the @entity166 earlier this week was deeply worrying			1
describing lord @entity159 , who advised mr @entity22 and is now a @entity168 peer , as a ‘ very good man ’ , he added : ‘ if @entity170 can say that there is something obviously wrong with our communication with business			0
’ @entity3 has admitted that he will be hit by the mansion tax on his £ 2.7million home			2
the @entity1 leader whose four - bedroom home @entity178 has risen in value by £ 1.1million since it was bought five years ago , said he would be ‘ very happy ’ to pay the controversial charge , which he has said will raise money for the @entity182 .			0
