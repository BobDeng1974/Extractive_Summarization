just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease , a study has found			1
researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen			1
@entity12 is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause , and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer			1
just two cups of coffee a day can halve the risk of breast cancer returning and boosts the effect of the drug tamoxifen , researchers found most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow , and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells			1
this means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether			0
as part of the study , @entity26 and @entity27 researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients , in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago			0
they found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen , and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day , had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee , or none at all			1
@entity43 , a researcher from @entity44 who carried out the study , said : ' the study also shows that those who drank at least two cups of coffee a day had smaller tumours and a lower proportion of hormone - dependent tumours			1
' we saw that this was already the case at the time of diagnosis			0
' researchers also looked more closely at two substances that usually occur in coffee â€“ caffeine and caffeic acid			0
they found the breast cancer cells reacted to these substances , especially caffeine			1
caffeine caused the cells to divide less frequency , and die more often , especially when it was drunk in combination with tamoxifen			1
the study found caffeine caused breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and die more often ms @entity43 said : ' this shows that these substances have an effect on the breast cancer cells and turn off signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow			1
' the team demonstrated both in in breast cancer patients and at cell level that coffee can reinforce the effect of treatment with tamoxifen			2
however , they emphasise the importance of taking prescribed medication			0
ms @entity86 added : ' they are incredibly important , but if you like coffee and are also taking tamoxifen , there is no reason to stop drinking it			2
' just two cups a day is sufficient to make a difference			0
' this is not the first study to link coffee consumption with improved cancer prognosis			0
drinking coffee may reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers , research has found			2
a @entity104 study shows the hot drink can protect against liver cancer , which is often associated with alcohol abuse			0
for each cup consumed a day , there is about a 14 per cent decreased risk of liver cancer , found the study by the @entity104			0
and scientists at @entity113 have found that women who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a 20 per cent lower risk of developing the most common form of skin cancer compared to those who had less than one cup per month			2
they also found that men who drank the same amount saw a nine per cent lower risk of the skin cancer , basal cell carcinoma .			0

coffee can stop cancer returning in women treated with tamoxifen
@entity12 stops oestrogen reaching tumour cells , so they do not grow
coffee drinkers had fewer cancers and their tumours were smaller
caffeine cuts of signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow
