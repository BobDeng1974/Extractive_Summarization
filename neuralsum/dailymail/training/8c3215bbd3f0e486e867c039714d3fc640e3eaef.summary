the institution cost more than one billion @entity5 dollars ( £ 65million ) to build , and is the largest project of its kind in the @entity211 country			0

her shy twin sister @entity212 hides from the monarch ( right ) although possibly one of the more modest gifts the @entity2 has received in her 59 - year reign , the eucalyptus twig in question was , in fact , art. it was part of an @entity281 - inspired collaborative artwork in which children have painted messages on sticks and made a nest out of them			1
when she was presented with the stick and its message of hope and sustainability by 16 - year - old @entity290 , the @entity2 looked suitably grateful during her tour of the @entity292 , part of the @entity294			2
@entity38 , however , did not twig the significance of the item and said : ' put it on the nest , ' prompting the assembled dignitaries to burst out laughing			2
