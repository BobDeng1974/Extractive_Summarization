by @entity0 resplendent in a bright pink striped dress , a fluorescent shell and bead necklace and a gleaming lion skin robe , @entity1 looks every inch the queen			1
one of the @entity8 's last tribal monarchs , @entity9 @entity9 , leader of the @entity11 tribe , offered photographer @entity12 a rare glimpse into her world and allowed him inside the royal palace , which is protected by an elaborate labyrinth			1
from within her sprawling thatched palace , she rules over the @entity11 's 55 villages with the help of a council , or board , whose members she chooses herself and can fire at will			1
indeed , according to @entity12 , she did so just before the visit on the grounds that the offending councillor was ' lazy '			2
royal : @entity1 is the queen of the @entity11 people of northern @entity8 and has reigned since being elected in 2005 dynasty : queen @entity9 has four children and one adopted son , and is the granddaughter of @entity8 national hero , @entity34 home : the @entity9 lives in a royal palace that is surrounded by a labyrinth built from mopane wood and designed to baffle unwanted intruders @entity40 : queen @entity9 has embraced modernity and dreams of meeting @entity9 whom she says could learn much from the tribe another duty is managing the ' omaada ' or royal granary which is filled courtesy of a tax levied on subjects that requires each to turn over part of his or her harvest to the @entity9			1
if famine strikes , the store opened up to the populace so no one goes hungry			1
when not taking care of business at the omaada or tending to her @entity61 positive adopted son , much of her time is spent touring her kingdom , visiting the sick in hospital and hearing the petitions of village elders from the throne room in the centre of her palace			1
to get in , visitors must endure an elaborate security process that begins with shouting loudly on approach and involves navigating an intricate labyrinth before submitting to a ceremonial greeting and a lengthy wait in one of the antechambers before being called in to see her			0
' only those who are familiar with the palace know how to get inside , ' says @entity12			0
' it was built to make the invaders lose their way and it 's protected by the men who live on the outside			0
the women live in the middle and the @entity9 ls in the centre			2
' annex : guests visiting the palace must wait to be greeted in the second antechamber ( pictured ) before being allowed an audience with @entity9 @entity9 tradition : like her ancestors , the @entity9 wears a lion skin robe and sports a delicate shell necklace of the sort also worn by other women in the tribe family : 30 people currently live in the palace with @entity9 @entity9 , among them her adopted @entity61 positive son who came to live with her last year royal family : the @entity9 with her four children , adopted son and her horde of grandchildren - all of whom live with her in the palace colourful : the onyoko necklace is made from seashells and was once a symbol of wealth			1
now easily available , the jewel is now a symbol of womanhood home : the royal palace is designed to protect the women and children who live there , so the strongest men are given sleeping places around the outside colourful : queen @entity9 says that the part of @entity11 tradition she 's most keen to preserve is the gorgeous colourful clothes and traditional jewels elegant : the @entity11 are famous for their love of bright colour and print , as well as their traditional onyoka shell beads @entity12 travelled with guides from @entity145 and @entity146 , which offers a 12 - day tour that includes a visit to the @entity9 's lands plus accommodation , meals and transfers , with packages starting at £ 1,874 per person			1
for more information , see @entity156 @entity158 offers return flights to @entity160 from @entity161 via @entity162 from £ 1,010			0
for further information on @entity8 , please visit namibiatourism.com.na for more of @entity12 's work both in @entity8 and elsewhere , see ericlafforgue.com			1
surrounding the palace is a stockade made from tough mopane wood , which is spiked in a bid to keep both enemies and local elephants at bay			0
' by the fence is the olupale where the men gather to tell stories at night while having a few drinks , ' explains @entity12			0
' people put the skulls of the cows killed during the reign of the @entity9 on the fence			1
cows are slaughtered for weddings or funerals , and sometimes to use as a trade for millet if the harvest was bad			0
when the @entity9 dies , all of it will be burned			2
' @entity9 , who has ruled the @entity11 since being elected by a council of elders in 2005 , hopes to one day build a museum to house some of the tribe 's most important cultural artifacts and to highlight some of her most illustrious ancestors , among them , her grandfather @entity34			1
the last king of the @entity11 , @entity34 is a national hero in both @entity8 and neighbouring @entity199 and was killed fighting @entity201 forces as they swept through what was then @entity205 [ @entity204 @entity203 ] in 1917			1
after @entity8 was incorporated into @entity201 , many of the tribal royals were banned and @entity9 @entity9 's family were only reinstated , following much discussion among the elders , after the country gained independence in 1990			1
since regaining her throne , @entity9 @entity9 's mission has been to boost @entity11 culture and wellbeing of its people , and says there is much that other royals , the @entity220 's own @entity9 among them , could learn from her tribe and its traditions			1
' she dreams of meeting @entity9 one day and has invited her to visit twice , ' explains @entity12			1
queen @entity9 adds : ' anyone can enter my palace			1
the @entity9 should come here to take lessons from our traditions			2
' dapper : the women are n't the only ones with a natty sense of style : the men too embrace fashion although they do n't always make it as colourful stylish : cowhide sandals are worn by almost everyone and last for years			0
according to the @entity11 , if the bottom of your foot itches , someone is coming to visit dancing queens : @entity11 girls clap and laugh as they break into an impromptu dance - much to the delight of everyone watching happy : most @entity11 live off the land and consider their cows to be their wealth			2
most are never killed and are kept solely for milk and barter busy : most of the @entity11 work in the fields or in their villages			2
others help staff the royal palace building the vast elephant - proof mopane wood fences @entity262 's @entity261 might be the @entity203 's best known monarch thanks to his vast harem of wives but the priapic king is by no means alone			2
from @entity269 to @entity270 , the continent is awash with royal families , although few enjoy powers comparable to those of @entity261 @entity270 is home to no fewer than five monarchies , among them rulers belonging to the @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 tribes			0
most powerful are the ' @entity281 ' of the kingdom of @entity278 ; an area located in and around @entity270 capital @entity284			0
currently , the tribe is led by the @entity287 - educated @entity286 , who has ruled the kingdom from the imposing @entity289 since 1993			0
like @entity220 royal wives , his spouse , @entity290 , the @entity291 of @entity278 , spends her time working on charitable campaigns and has her own foundation , the @entity296			0
she is also patron of the @entity297 and @entity298			0
other @entity270 royals include @entity300 , @entity301 of the @entity303 people who inhabit the @entity304 , and 18 - year - old @entity305 whose mother , the colourful @entity306 , is notorious for her links with former @entity309 leader @entity308			0
elsewhere , the @entity311 people of @entity269 are ruled by @entity312 , formerly the @entity269 ambassador to @entity313 and the emir of the @entity315 since 1953			0
while most of his reforms have proved popular , his embrace of education has put him at odds with radical @entity321 group @entity320 , and he narrowly avoided assassination last year following an attack that injured two of his sons and left his driver and bodyguard dead			0
one of the few remaining monarchies that still rules by decree is that of sultan @entity330 of @entity331 , who has enacted a number of far reaching changes to the laws of the country since his accession in 1999			0
among them are making the @entity339 language one of the country 's official tongues , guaranteeing social and civic equality for women and handing more power to @entity331 's elected parliament - in particular , the prime minister who now has the power to dissolve @entity348 at will			2
delicious : during the rainy season , children make a little extra pocket money by catching frogs , which the tribe then eat boiled and sprinkled with salt happy : under @entity9 @entity9 , no person will go hungry thanks to the royal granaries which are opened up to the @entity11 people when famine strikes helping out : during harvest , every member of the tribe pitches in to help grind up millet for flour and also to prepare it for storage competition : during milling , women will chant ditties about their strength with each encouraging the others in a bid to be seen as the strongest @entity373 : an @entity11 girl carries a woven plate full of millet and shows off her cheerful sunshine yellow top as she goes friends : when the @entity9 was reinstated after @entity8 regained independence , younger members of the tribe welcomed her back help for the aged : elderly people play a key role in @entity11 society and are helped in their old age by @entity9 and younger members of the tribe @entity389 : @entity390 falls over @entity11 lands in northern @entity8			1
tribal land also extends across the border into southern @entity199			0
