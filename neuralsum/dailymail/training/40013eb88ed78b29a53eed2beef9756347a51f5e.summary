health officials have opened a debate about how the future of gp services across the capital should be transformed			2
@entity34 @entity44 ’s @entity37 arm said that ' tweaking around the edges will not be an option ' as it launched the debate			2
there is ' unprecedented strain ' on gp practices across the capital as population growth and widening health inequalities drive up demand for services , officials said			0
setting out the case for change in a new report , officials said a greater proportion of patient contacts are likely to be carried out through non-face - to - face digital channels			1

dr @entity17 , who has recently been appointed by @entity44 ( @entity37 ) as clinical chairwoman of primary care transformation , said the number of patients who access care online will ' rapidly grow ' in coming years			1
' if we fast - forward 10 years there will be a much higher percentage of contacts with patients online through a different offering , just like our banking services and just like our non-grocery shopping - which i understand is going to be 80 per cent by 2020 , ' she said			1
' i do n’t think it will be as high as that but i would n’t be surprised if online access to some form of healthcare would n’t be about 40 per cent			1
many people are already using online support			2
many people @entity96 their symptoms			0
on the increase : electronic consultations , instead of the traditional face - to - face meetings with @entity100 , are also expected to become more popular ' if you look at the exponential rise of how people use banking and online shopping , once we reach a tipping point where patients are comfortable to use it , doctors and nurses are comfortable with the technology and the platforms are robust , we probably will see an exponential rise in the number of people using online help through an accredited or systematic way			1
' she added : ' if we fast - forward to 2020 , online booking to gp practices , repeat prescribing will be pretty much 100 per cent			1
the transactional stuff will be nearly 100 per cent but the stuff that requires the consultation may well be a good bit less but i think it will grow year - on - year			2
' dr @entity17 cautioned that any online health platform must be ' safe ' , adding : ' it has to be done safely otherwise you end up having a pregnant woman having a miscarriage and we say it ’s a urine infection , so it has to be safe			1
' @entity34 officials said that the future of general practice in @entity37 could see ' federations ' of @entity140 surgeries			0
these groups of practices could improve access to gp services and could also mean that basic diagnostic elements , such as blood tests , are carried out at @entity139 so patients do not have to go to another appointment in another building , officials said			0

there is a growing consensus that we need to look at how we deliver services			0
@entity100 are saying that they can not provide the care that they want to provide to their patients and get the outcomes they would like			1
' she added : ' a population boom , more complex long - term conditions and longer life expectancy together with rising costs means that many doctors simply ca n’t meet the demands placed on them			2
' that can often mean a long wait for an appointment , lack of choice over the doctor you see and opening hours that do n’t work for working people			0
it also means less co-ordinated care for patients with long - term conditions which can result in fragmented care			2
' in january , @entity44 will publish a set of proposals describing what gp services in @entity37 should look like .			0
