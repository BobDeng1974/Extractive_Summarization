astronomers have found a distant planet so strange , that according to current planet formation theories , it should n’t even exist			1
the planet is 11 times @entity5 ’s mass and orbits its star at an incredible 650 times the average @entity9 - @entity8 distance			1
named hd 106906 b , the planet is unlike anything in our own solar system and does n’t fit with any existing planet formation theories			1
however , this process acts too slowly to grow giant planets far from their star			0
another proposed mechanism is that giant planets can form from a fast , direct collapse of disk material			0
but primordial disks rarely contain enough mass in their outer reaches to allow a planet like hd 106906 b to be created			0
@entity45 b is shown in thermal infrared light			0
the planet is more than 20 times farther away from its star than @entity49 is from our sun hd 106906 b is 11 times @entity5 ’s mass and orbits its star at an incredible 650 times the average @entity9 - @entity8 distance			1
at only 13 million years old , this young planet still glows from the residual heat of its formation			0
it has a temperature of @entity61 ( about 1,500 ° c ) making it much cooler than its host star			1
it emits most of its energy as infrared rather than visible light			0
@entity9 , by comparison , formed 4.5 billion years ago and is about 350 times older			0
several alternative theories have been put forward , including formation like a mini binary star system			2
‘ a binary star system can be formed when two adjacent clumps of gas collapse more or less independently to form stars , and these stars are close enough to each other to exert a mutual gravitation attraction and bind them together in an orbit , ’ said @entity71 , a student at @entity21 who led the research			2
‘ it is possible that in the case of the @entity86 system the star and planet collapsed independently from clumps of gas			2
’ one problem with this scenario is that the mass ratio of the two stars in a binary system is typically no more than 10 - to - 1			2
‘ in our case , the mass ratio is more than 100 - to - 1 , ’ she explained			2
‘ this extreme mass ratio is not predicted from binary star formation theories – just like planet formation theory predicts that we can not form planets so far from the host star			1
’ the team was able to confirm that the planet is moving together with its host star by examining @entity107 data taken eight years prior for another research programme this system has also sparked interest because researchers can still detect the remnant ‘ debris disk ’ of material left over from planet and star formation			1
‘ systems like this one , where we have additional information about the environment in which the planet resides , have the potential to help us disentangle the various formation models , ’ said ms @entity71 added			0
‘ future observations of the planet 's orbital motion and the primary star 's debris disk may help answer that question			1
’ at only 13 million years old , this young planet still glows from the residual heat of its formation			0
it has a temperature of @entity61 ( about 1,500 ° c ) making it much cooler than its host star			1

@entity9 , by comparison , formed 4.5 billion years ago and is about 350 times older than @entity140 b. the team was able to confirm that the planet is moving together with its host star by examining @entity107 data taken eight years prior for another research programme			1
‘ such detailed information is rarely available for directly imaged exoplanets , making hd 106906 b a valuable target for future study , ’ said co-investigator @entity145 , a graduate student in the @entity21 @entity146 .			0

the 1,500 ° c planet , named @entity153 , is 11 times @entity5 ’s mass
it orbits its star at 650 times the average @entity9 - @entity8 distance
according to current planet formation theories , this should *n't* be possible
the system has also sparked interest because there is a remnant ‘ debris disk ’ of material left over from planet and star formation
