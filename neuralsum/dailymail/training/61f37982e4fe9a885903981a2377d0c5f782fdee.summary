rating : @entity0 looks like an ordinary family home - and , more important , it feels like an ordinary family home			1
it has been run as a hotel by one family since 1948 , and so you might expect a little complacency to have crept in			1
sitting just outside @entity10 in @entity11 , this is not so much a class act as a lesson in top - notch hospitality without a whiff of pretension			2
you feel at ease , relaxed and gloriously comfortable			2
anyone for tennis ? the inspector found a slice of country - retreat splendour at @entity0 we are talking old - fashioned smart , a reminder that pelmets and chintz have not entirely had their day			1
the ladies ' loo on the first floor is called @entity31			2
there are two grass tennis courts in summer			1
a grand woman called @entity35 , who lived to be 97 , and her husband @entity36 used to run it ; their grandson is now in charge			1
at least , we think she must have been grand			2
in the bar - where you help yourself and jot down what you 've had - there are framed photographs and letters , including a note from the @entity48 about her racehorses and a signed snap of @entity51			0
princess @entity52 is up there , too , along with @entity54 and @entity55			0
our room has no fewer than three big sash windows and a fourth in the bathroom			0
it looks out over an immaculate six - hole pitch and putt course and the rolling @entity63 beyond			0
a spa has been added , with a terrific indoor pool and treatments galore , set discreetly away from the house			1
pool your resources : the hotel has been in the same family since 1948 , but shows no sign of complacency there 's nothing old - fashioned about the food			1
the @entity78 chef works his magic with fresh ingredients sourced locally			0
some people might want a livelier atmosphere in the dining room and at one point my wife finds the conversation at the next table more interesting than at ours			0
but that 's my problem			0
it 's not bad value either			0
we 're paying £ 249 for bed , three - course dinner and a delicious breakfast			0
we arrive late on a friday and leave early - ish the next morning , but still feel we 've had a proper break in a proper hotel			2
