@entity0 can still lift 100kg weights - despite being eight months pregnant			1
the 39 - year - old , who is 38 weeks into her first pregnancy , is still lifting heavy weights at @entity6 sessions and believes the practice has helped her stay healthy throughout her pregnancy			1
company pregnancy health and safety regulations at @entity0 's job as a conference and events sales manager mean that she ca n't even lift a water receptacle in the workplace			1
@entity0 , from @entity24 , had been practicing @entity6 for three years before falling pregnant and after finding out she was expecting , she began researching the effects of exercise			2
she said : ' when i first fell pregnant i researched online and found a lot of positives about exercise and pregnancy			2
' i spoke to the midwife in my initial visit and she told me to listen to my body			0
' she said that strength training is fine and to keep it up			0
although @entity0 is aware that some women have received criticism for exercising during pregnancy , she is confident that she is doing the best for herself and her baby ' i trust my own judgement			1
' @entity0 continued her regime of weightlifting , cardio and gymnastics , altering her exercise as the pregnancy progressed			1
she continued to train up to five times a week , but scaled down her exertions to a level that felt safe for herself and her baby			1
she said : ' i have reduced the weights as my pregnancy has progressed and i only do what feels comfortable			2
' and @entity0 's fianc√©e @entity20 , 28 , a fellow @entity6 enthusiast , has been supportive of @entity58 's continued exercise			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity20 is ever so proud			1
he crossfits himself and thinks it 's fantastic i 'm keeping it up			0
@entity0 has continued her regime of weightlifting , cardio and gymnastics up to five times a week ' he 's been really supportive of me			1
once in a while he does say i need to slow down a little bit because i am quite competitive on certain things , but mainly he 's very supportive and proud of what i 'm doing and achieving			2
' we 're both trying to find out information and be careful			0
' @entity20 , a flight stimulator technician , also researched the effects of pregnancy and @entity6 and helped @entity0 to adjust			1
he said : ' we sat down when we first found out she was pregnant and worked out how she could continue her training in a way that was safe for her and the baby			0
' eventually she started doing press ups on a box so her bump would n't hit the floor and she uses bands to lessen the strain of pull - ups			0
' but she 's really taken the reins herself and listened to her body			0
i fully trust her and she 's done fantastically well			0
' but not everyone agreed with @entity0 's decision to power on with her @entity6 regime , including her soon - to - be mother - in - law			1
@entity20 said : ' my mother was slightly apprehensive of @entity58 doing exercise			2
@entity20 also researched the effects of pregnancy and @entity6 and helped @entity0 to adjust ' she 's of the old school era where doing things like this are slightly frowned upon and she would have preferred @entity58 to be at home resting			1
' but @entity58 has shown that it is possible and really encouraged other women that you do n't have to just sit down , you can be energetic , go for walks and go swimming , and that 's perfectly fine for you and the baby			0
' elsewhere reactions to @entity0 's intensive regime have been mixed			1
@entity0 said : ' everyone at @entity6 has huge respect for what i 'm doing as they understand the discipline and my dedication			2
' other people who do n't know a great deal about @entity6 have been more worried and sceptical			0
' my family are supportive but they just warn me to be careful and not to overdo it			0
' and although @entity0 is aware that some women have received criticism for exercising during pregnancy , she is confident that she is doing the best for herself and her baby			1
' a hundred years back women did n't stop working in the fields because they were pregnant , they still had manual stuff to do , ' she said			0
' i train four or five times a week and i feel absolutely fantastic			1
my energy levels have kept up and it 's helped me throughout the whole pregnancy			2
' i 'm not just swinging weights around , i 'm taking care of my body and my baby and if something does n't feel right then i try something else			0
' i think sometimes we forget that life goes on and does n't stop because you 're pregnant - it 's not an illness			0
' and at the end of the day , i 'm not doing what 's right for other people , i 'm doing what 's right for me			0
' now @entity0 and @entity20 are excitedly awaiting the birth of their new arrival			1
' i ca n't wait to be a father , ' added @entity20			2
' i ca n't wait to see the smile on @entity58 's face and just look in the baby 's eyes and start this family rolling			0
