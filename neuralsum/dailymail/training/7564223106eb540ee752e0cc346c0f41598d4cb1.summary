when @entity2 began talking about intimidation on sunday , @entity1 ’s penalty shoot - out hero admitted he crossed the fine line when it comes to sporting behaviour			1
the @entity8 goalkeeper , thrown on by @entity9 in the 119th minute of their quarter - final with @entity12 in @entity13 , had screamed ‘ @entity16 ! ’ in the face of every penalty taker			1
it pushed the boundaries , but @entity2 could n’t care less			1
@entity1 play @entity19 in a mouth - watering semi-final in @entity22 on wednesday and @entity12 are on their way home from the @entity25 in @entity26			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t think i did anything wrong			2
i did n’t shout in an aggressive manner			1
‘ i did everything in my power and i would be happy to do it again , absolutely no problem			0
i was ready for the moment			0
‘ i told them i knew where they were going and i had analysed it			1
i tried to get in their heads and it worked			2
‘ the manager and the ' keeper coach @entity65 told me before the game that if there was a substitution left then there was a possibility i would be used in the shoot - out			2
‘ i only heard at the hotel , when i was stepping on to bus to the stadium that i could be used			0
‘ @entity65 told me to keep it between us because we wanted to finish it the job before the 90 , or 120 , minutes			2
i watched the game with a different feel because i knew that it could happen			2
’ when it did , in the 119th minute of a dramatic and absorbing clash , @entity38 kicked a water bottle as he walked off the pitch			2
the @entity87 keeper was calmer on sunday , even joking that he only kicked the bottle to spray water over @entity65 to ‘ cool him down ’			0
power of persuasion : did @entity2 influence the @entity12 players with his pre-penalty routine ? jokers : @entity95 ( right ) has a laugh with @entity97 ( left ) and @entity98 in @entity1 training ready : the @entity1 are now preparing for their next challenge against @entity19 in the semi-finals 2006 - now : @entity8 ( 122 apps ) 2007 - 2008 : @entity103 ( loan ) ( 22 apps ) 2008 - 2009 : @entity106 ( loan ) ( 9 apps ) 2011 - now : @entity1 ( 6 caps ) by then @entity2 had been through a thorough warm - up on the touchline in the @entity112 as they attempted to psyche out @entity12 ’s players in the moments before the end of extra-time			1
@entity2 , who revealed @entity12 ’s players changed the direction of their penalties in the shoot - out , went on to save efforts @entity123 and @entity34			1
2010 - 2011 : @entity124 ( 34 apps ) 2011 - now : @entity87 ( 34 apps ) 2013 - 2013 : @entity87 ( @entity127 ) ( 3 apps ) 2013 - now : @entity1 ( 13 caps ) the @entity1 ' keeper added : ‘ when i started my warm up the whole bench was confused about what was going on			1
‘ if you see their manager ’s ( @entity135 ) face , he was looking over to see @entity9 and it was priceless			1
‘ they were under massive pressure to deliver			0
it was a way of trying to psyche them out and they were definitely unsettled when i started warming up			0
‘ i did nothing crazy			0
against @entity146 they took the penalties five times differently from the way they took them against me			0
’ @entity95 revealed that he had turned to @entity2 because he believed the goalkeeper ’s greater physical presence would be a psychological advantage in the shoot - out			1
at 1m93cm @entity2 is five centimetres taller than @entity1 ’s first choice keeper , but his record at saving penalties has not been good			1
save : the more physical @entity2 says he ' did nothing crazy ' during the shoot - out against @entity12 ready : @entity2 says ' when i started my warm up the whole bench was confused about what was going on ' video @entity164 a step closer to ending trophy drought @entity1 : @entity38 6 ( @entity2 , 120 , 8 ) , @entity166 6 , @entity167 7 , @entity168 6 ( @entity169 105 ) , @entity170 6 , @entity171 7 , @entity98 7 , @entity172 6 , @entity173 8 , @entity174 6 , @entity175 6 ( @entity176 76 6 )			1
