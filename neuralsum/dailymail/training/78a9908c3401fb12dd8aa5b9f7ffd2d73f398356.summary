by @entity0 out : @entity1 paid the price for his ' toxic ' public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms @entity1 was demoted yesterday as @entity7 ’s election guru @entity8 engineered a ruthless elevation of women and @entity11			1
the education secretary , a hero for the @entity14 , paid the price for his ‘ toxic ’ public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms			1
to the alarm of education reformers , he was shifted to become chief whip – a position hailed as ‘ one of the most important jobs ’ in government by @entity7 , but one which will mean a substantial pay cut and an end to his full @entity28 status			1
mr @entity1 ’s former aide , @entity30 , accused the prime minister of ‘ surrender ’			1
the populist hand of mr @entity8 , the @entity34 ’ @entity36 chief election strategist , was detected across yesterday ’s reshuffle			2
designed to turn the @entity14 top team into an ‘ election - winning machine ’ , it was by far the most extensive shake - up mr @entity7 has carried out in his nine years as party leader			1
a succession of telegenic women – including two working mothers , @entity45 and @entity46 – won big promotions			0
at 38 , miss @entity45 , tipped as a potential future party leader , became the youngest woman cabinet minister ever , while mrs @entity51 will replace mr @entity1 as @entity52			1
@entity53 , appointed as foreign secretary after @entity55 stood down to become leader of the @entity57 , was hailed as the most @entity11 holder of the post since the @entity60			0
opponents of @entity14 plans to reform @entity63 human rights laws , including attorney general @entity64 , were swept away			0
in all , 11 male ministers , most of them middle - aged , jumped before they were pushed or were sacked by mr @entity7			2
his most difficult exchange is understood to have been with outgoing environment secretary @entity68 , whose dismissal infuriated some on the @entity14 of the party			0
the biggest shock was the move out of education for mr @entity1 , one of the prime minister ’s oldest friends and allies			1
just weeks ago , mr @entity7 appeared to guarantee him his job during exchanges at @entity76 ’s questions			2
mr @entity1 , the architect of the government ’s new free schools , funded by the state but unshackled from council control , told allies just days ago that he was going nowhere			1
shake - up : @entity8 ( left ) , @entity7 's election guru , designed the reshuffle to make the top @entity14 team an ' election - winning machine '			1
it 's by far the biggest shake - up in the prime minister 's nine years as leader but senior figures in @entity95 , including chief of staff @entity96 , are understood to have been increasingly exasperated by mr @entity1 ’s public battles with colleagues			1
in recent months , he has clashed with education minister @entity100 and home secretary @entity101 , and has maintained a constant state of warfare with an education establishment he branded ‘ @entity105 ’			0
mr @entity8 is thought to have pointed to polling evidence suggesting mr @entity1 ’s unpopularity had spread beyond teachers and was contaminating the government ’s education message more widely			1
one recent @entity112 poll showed voters now oppose schools becoming academies by 41 per cent to 31 per cent and mr @entity1 ’s flagship free schools project by 53 per cent to 23 per cent			1
other polling evidence showed the @entity52 had become one of the most recognisable members of the government – equal only to mr @entity7 and chancellor @entity121 – but by far its most unpopular senior minister			2
within the past few days mr @entity7 is understood to have spoken to mr @entity1 to suggest a move to replace sir @entity124 , the outgoing chief whip , who is in charge of party discipline			1
traditionally , the role is conducted out of public view , but the prime minister sought to sweeten the pill by promising mr @entity1 he would be one of his main election advisers and would appear regularly in the media			1
former @entity14 whip sir @entity133 said : ‘ if the spin is true and we have a chief whip who regularly addresses the nation , i think this will prove a mistake			1
’ there were claims – hotly disputed by the @entity142 – that @entity121 initially opposed the idea of a move for the @entity52 , who has emerged as the unofficial head of the chancellor ’s campaign to succeed mr @entity7			2
@entity149 's teachers wasted no time in gloating over @entity1 ’s demotion yesterday , going online to share expletive - filled insults and pictures of voodoo dolls to send the @entity52 on his way			2
within hours of the shock announcement , # @entity156 was trending on @entity157 amid reports of teachers cheering , ‘ weeping with joy ’ and high - fiving each other in the corridors of schools around the country			0
one staff room reportedly even brought out ‘ the posh biscuits ’ to celebrate			0
a knitted doll of mr @entity1 , stuck with pins , was tweeted by @ @entity169 , with the message : ‘ @entity46 replaces @entity1 as education secretary			1
probably wo n’t need this any more then			0
’ opponents were also encouraged to attack him on @entity157 via an online game called ‘ slap @entity1 ’ , which saw him being struck hundreds of thousands of times yesterday			0
there were also mocked - up photos of mr @entity1 receiving an ‘ f ’ in his exam results and being ‘ sent to the naughty step ’ , while he was even likened to a sexually transmitted disease			1
trade unionists could not contain their glee as they claimed the @entity186 strike last week , which caused disruption to thousands of parents and pupils , had successfully ousted mr @entity1			2
an @entity186 poster was circulated online , stating : ‘ your pressure has had an impact			0
government policy must now urgently change			0
’ glee : the @entity186 poster that was shared online ( left ) and a mobile phone game which allows you to ' slap @entity1 ' asked if the change of job represented a ‘ punishment ’ , mr @entity7 insisted : ‘ i can tell you , if you are prime minister , the chief whip is one of the most important jobs in government			1
i wanted one of my big hitters , one of my real stars , one of my great brains , someone who has done extraordinary things for education in this country , to do that job , to deliver the government ’s programme , to help secure the future for our country			0
’ he said he was proud to lead ‘ a fresh team with the ideas , the energy and the ability to take this country forward ’			0
aides insisted mrs @entity51 was ‘ 100 per cent ’ behind mr @entity1 ’s reforms			2
mr @entity1 insisted the prime minister had given him the choice of taking charge of the whips ’ office or staying where he was			2
he appeared unaware that the move will mean taking a pay cut – from £ 141,647 to £ 103,937			0
he admitted : ‘ it ’s naturally a wrench to be moved from a job i love … @entity237 , emotion , locomotion , whatever i ’m engaged in today , i ’m pushing forward the government ’s agenda			0
’ there was dismay on the @entity244 at his move			0
senior mps questioned why miss @entity45 , who was mr @entity1 ’s deputy as schools minister , had not been promoted to take the job if there was no desire to signal a break with his agenda			2
there were indications on unhappiness in the party at the scale of mr @entity7 ’s purge			0
centrists were dismayed at the departure of pro-european veteran @entity260 , mr @entity64 , who had defended the @entity63 court of human rights , and climate change minister @entity263			0
former @entity14 mp @entity264 claimed the ‘ desire for publicity ’ of mr @entity1 ’s former aide mr @entity30 , who has been scathing about mr @entity7 and his senior officials , had ‘ got the best education secretary we ’ve ever had sacked ’			1
mr @entity30 dismissed that accusation and suggested instead it was a surprise that mr @entity1 had lasted so long			1
he added : ‘ we got away with subverting every @entity274 and @entity275 process , and it took @entity7 four years to surrender			0
we assumed he would in 2012 and 2013			0

@entity1 paid the price for his public image which turned voters against him
will become chief whip , leading to the loss of his full @entity28 status
