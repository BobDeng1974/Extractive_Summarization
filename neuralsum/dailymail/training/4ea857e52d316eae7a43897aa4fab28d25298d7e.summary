by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 06:33 est , 23 october 2013 vine videos are a relatively new phenomenon but the idea of making short moving pictures dates back as far as the early 19th century			0
in 1829 , a @entity6 physicist invented the phenakistoscope , or ' spindle viewer ' as a toy for his sons			1
it spun images around an axis making them appear to move when looked at in a mirror			1
the images depicted traditional scenes , including couples dancing and horses jumping , to more abstract clips such as men diving into the mouths of lions , and now artist @entity24 has created digital versions of these stunning animations			1
still images were drawn onto a disc and each image was slightly different , in the same way images are drawn on the pages of a flip book			1
this disc was attached to another that had slits cut around it and both were attached to an axis in the centre			2
the disc with the images on was held in front of a mirror and was spun around this axis			1
when looked at in the mirror , the images appeared to move in circles			1
the toy was created by blind scientist @entity49 at the same time @entity51 @entity50 designed an identical device called the stroboscope			2
still images were drawn onto a disc and each image was slightly different , in the same way images are drawn on the pages of a flip book			1
this disc was attached to another that had slits cut around it and both were attached to an axis in the centre			0
the disc with the images on was held in front of a mirror and was spun around this axis			1
when looked at in the mirror , through the slits , the images appeared to move in circles			1
the phenakistoscope was also referred to as the @entity74 and @entity75 and was ultimately replaced by @entity77 's zoetrope			2
a zoetrope is different because the images are fitted inside a spinning wheel and users peer through the slits in the side of the toy			0
this means more than one person can see the moving images for various angles			0
although the toy was invented before @entity90 took to the throne , it became popular during her reign			0
@entity49 's design was based on the work of @entity95 and his ' @entity96 ' , which spun two discs in opposite directions to create an electrical charge from a magnetic field			0
the phenakistoscope toy , pictured left , was created by blind scientist @entity49 and showed moving images in a mirror			2
it was ultimately replaced by the zoetrope , pictured right , that used the same principles but the images are instead fitted inside a wheel and can be viewed by multiple people from different angles it used the principle of ' persistence of motion ' in which images are used in such a way to create an illusion of motion			0
a later , handheld version of @entity49 's design was created in which the discs were separated , thus removing the need for a mirror			0
examples of scenes , depicted on the original phenakistoscope , include a couple dancing and horses jumping over fences			2
others show jesters performing star jumps as red and yellow birds fly near their heads , frogs hopping around a circle of grass blowing in the wind , and magpies bouncing on top of people 's heads as the people are showing eating small blue balls			0
there are also kaleidoscopic phenakistoscopes that use geometric shapes to create a hypnotic effect , and more surreal images of men climbing ladders into the mouth of the @entity154 , or diving into the mouths of lions .			0

@entity74 was created in @entity6 as a *predecessor* to the flip book
images were spun round an axis in such a way that they appeared to move
the *gif* *-* style results include couples dancing and leaping *clowns*
artist has now turned a *selection* of these images into *mesmerising* *gif*s
