by @entity0 two incredibly well - preserved @entity2 tridents discovered in northern @entity3 have gone on show to the public for the first time			1
the pristinely preserved wooden tridents , which measure around six feet in length , were each crafted from a single plank of oak almost 6,000 years ago			1
they could be among the earliest farming tools used in @entity13 but no - one is entirely sure what the tridents were used for			1
the perfectly preserved wooden tridents , which measure around six feet in length , were each crafted from a single plank of oak almost 6,000 years ago the perfectly preserved wooden tridents , which measure around six feet in length , were each crafted from a single plank of oak			1
carbon dating has shown that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old , when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in the area the tridents could be used for farming , hunting or fishing			1
@entity29 , of @entity30 believes they are not curved enough to be a kind of pitchfork and are too heavy and unbalanced to be a fishing spear			0
he thinks they could have been used to pin fish to a river bed , while another man collected the catch in a basket			0
the tridents are made from mature oak and required a great amount of skill and time to make them			2
they survived intact for so long as they were buried in waterlogged deposits , which kept the air out and stopped them rotting			0
four almost identical tridents are known of and another two might have turned up in @entity53			1
the tools were discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations prior to the construction of the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) near the village of @entity61			0
carbon dating has revealed that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old , when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in the area			2
however , while they may well be agricultural tools and bear some resemblance to pitchforks used for turning hay , experts believe the tridents could have been used for hunting or fishing			1
@entity29 , of @entity30 , who oversees the project , told @entity75 the tool appears to be too over-engineered to be a simple fishing spear - which were usually made of light , narrow strips of wood with a bone or flint tip so they could be thrown easily - while wood with a natural curve was usually chosen for pitchforks			2
the tridents discovered are heavy and made of mature oak			1
' it would have taken a massive effort to fell a big oak tree and split it into planks with hand axes and then carve the trident using stone tools - that 's hours of work , ' he said			2
' nothing fits very well so we think the trident had a very specific purpose			0
' some experts believe the tools could have been used for fishing , but instead of an individual throwing a simple spear , a trident was used to ' wedge ' salmon or eels to the floor , while another man collected the large fish in a basket			0
they also think it could have been used to stretch and hold a net across a stream , but the fishing connection would seem to be logical as the @entity117 , where the tridents were found , is still known for its excellent salmon fishing			2
the tridents survived intact for such a long period of time as they were buried in waterlogged deposits which , according to an archaeologist from @entity125 , kept the air out			0
just four similar tridents have been found in the @entity129 and all of them were unearthed the in 19th century , @entity127 reported			2
carbon dating has shown that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old , when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in @entity13			1
however , experts believe the tridents could have been used for fishing or hunting as well as for farming the latest discovery adds to the mystery surrounding the finds in @entity13 and @entity53 200 years ago			1
all the tridents have near identical designs and show a proficiency in woodworking suggesting they were made for an accepted purpose , experts said			0
the newly - discovered tools have gone on show at the @entity125 , which is encouraging visitors and social media followers to give their theories for what the tridents might have been used for			2
two of the other tridents , which are displayed at the @entity157 , were found in @entity158 , @entity13 , while the other two were plucked from a bog in @entity160 , @entity53			1
however , mr @entity29 said another couple of tridents discovered many years ago in @entity163 might have come to light recently as a result of the publicity surrounding the ' new ' @entity2 tools			1
the tools were discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations prior to the construction of the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) near the village of @entity61 so far , the tridents have only been found in areas that suggest an @entity176 distribution , he said , hinting that their design might have evolved to suit a relatively local purpose			0
mr @entity29 said that archaeologists have also found insect and pollen traces as well as preserved wood and seeds , which could give them a better picture of the valley environment in which our ancestors lived			0
he said that groups of people were still fairly mobile at the time but were starting to cultivate the land by planting seeds and probably keeping cattle			0
they lived in valleys and woodland composed of @entity198 , @entity199 and elm trees and at the time the trident was made , the number of oaks declined , perhaps indicating that people started clearing trees and used them make tools and shelters			0
the tridents were discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations prior to the construction of the @entity58 no houses were found near the site where the tridents were discovered , but there is a henge monument around 150 metres away , said mr @entity29			0
the archaeologists hope to learn more about the site and whether there are other similar tridents in private collections that could help them with their research			0
mr @entity29 said that the tridents discovered could even be 1,000 years older than currently thought .			1

the wooden tridents , which were discovered in @entity13 , measure around six feet in length and were each crafted from a single plank of oak
no - one is sure exactly what they were designed for but our ancestors might have used them for farming , fishing or hunting
the latest discovery add to the mystery surrounding very similar finds in @entity13 and @entity53 200 years ago
