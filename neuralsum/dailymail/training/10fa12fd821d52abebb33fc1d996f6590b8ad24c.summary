by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 this , as thursday demonstrated , is going to be a @entity3 of wild contrasts			1
a tournament played out against the backdrop of rubber bullets and civil unrest			0
a chaotic , carnival of football inside every stadium and a growing sense of resentment among those who could not even begin to entertain paying the price of a ticket			2
while 11 million @entity21 continue to live in abject poverty , the team whose job it is to remind them that this is not just about @entity24 suits and excess — but also about something as simple , as beautiful as a game of football — embarked on their journey			2
an encounter with @entity30 was the first of what @entity32 regards as the seven steps @entity35 must climb to win what he regards as their @entity3			1
ugly scenes : protestors clash with police on thursday afternoon before @entity35 's opening game firing line : police fire non-lethal rounds at protestors as tensions flare in @entity47 but it remained more than a little surreal given that it was only a few miles away that riot police employed extreme measures to deal with a group of protesters numbering no more than 50			1
it sounded as unnecessary as enlisting the services of @entity47 ’s @entity56 to escort @entity57 from his car to a hotel lobby earlier this week			0
the difference yesterday was that people got hurt , and that is sure to have saddened @entity32 and his players however much they would have been lifted by a staggering rendition of the national anthem by the @entity21 supporters who kept singing even after the music had stopped			0
the atmosphere was electric , the sense of excitement nerve - tingling			1
the night was not without its problems for the hosts			0
in one section of the stadium the lights appeared to fail , highlighting the fact that it takes more than a few thousand sacks of potatoes placed on seats — apparently each one was supposed to represent the weight of a small person — to establish whether it was ready for occupation			2
not in the script : @entity86 ( second right ) scores an own goal as @entity35 fall behind to @entity30 in shock : @entity35 fans ca n't believe it as their side fall 1 - 0 behind to @entity30 after a @entity86 own goal but @entity30 , labelled ‘ the @entity21 of @entity93 ’ , also put a bit of a spanner in the works , at least until @entity35 gained some composure and began to play with the finesse that propelled them to victory in last year ’s @entity101			1
that they failed to make their possession count as much as they would have liked was of little consequence in the end , the softest of penalties enabling @entity110 to send this place potty			0
it was not the only incident that will leave @entity30 aggrieved			0
@entity114 favoured the hosts last night , as did the decisions of a @entity118 referee who should wince when he watches the replays of this clash			0
level best : @entity110 ( left ) scores for @entity35 to make it 1 - 1 and ( below ) celebrates pure relief : @entity35 are ecstatic after @entity110 scores to make it 1 - 1 against @entity30 but that will do nothing to dampen the belief that the dream can become a reality and , as @entity32 said on the eve of this game , that their time has indeed arrived			1
that @entity110 ’s time appears to have arrived too might just alter the atmosphere beyond the walls of the @entity137			0
after this there might just be more desire to embrace the team if not the tournament as a whole			0
that said , even after this victory , the @entity146 studio in @entity147 was attacked by protesters who pelted it with missiles and cracked the glass			0
going to ground : @entity154 goes down after seemingly minimal contact from @entity30 defender @entity156 come back here ! @entity30 players charge after the referee after he awards @entity35 a penalty it will also help that , having beaten the second best team in their group , steps two and three against @entity162 and @entity163 should not hold many problems			1
whether it leads to a shift in the polls and the number of @entity21 in favour of hosting the @entity3 rises above 50 per cent again remains to be seen			1
but every tournament needs the hosts to do well and this @entity3 is no exception			1
it also needs its star players , and in @entity35 certainly have one .			2

riot police used extreme measures against protestors prior to the game
atmosphere in the stadium during the game way was electric
@entity35 's *success* will determine how this @entity3 is *remembered*
