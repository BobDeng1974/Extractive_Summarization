@entity1 manager @entity0 has warned his high - flying players he will not tolerate any big - headedness following their impressive start to the season			1
the @entity1 , who face @entity7 on saturday , are currently fourth in the @entity9 table following an excellent start to the campaign			1
@entity1 ’s start to the season has come as a surprise to some , with the @entity1 tipped to struggle this season			1
@entity17 has made a fine start to his @entity1 career with seven goals in as many starts the @entity1 striker scored the winner for his side against @entity9 champions @entity25 @entity17 ( centre ) , @entity27 ( right ) and @entity28 ( right ) have impressed for the @entity1 so far but a raft of summer arrivals including seven - goal @entity17 , @entity32 , @entity27 and @entity28 have so far quashed fears of another season battling relegation			1
however , @entity0 has fired a warning shot to his players , saying : ‘ it ’s not difficult for me ( to ignore the praise ) but sometimes the players find it a bit difficult			1
‘ i said to the players do n’t start reading about yourself too much or else we ’ ll have to start changing the size of the doors to get their heads through			2
‘ so keep your feet on the ground and do n’t read too much praise about yourself like you should n’t read too much of the criticism			2
@entity32 produced a commanding performance in @entity1 's midfield as they beat @entity25 ‘ you play it for the enjoyment and the praise that you get but make sure you manage it and control it well			1
‘ we have got to maintain it and our levels of performance			0
that is my responsibility because we have not been tested like this before and it ’s about whether we can sustain this success			0
‘ even last year when we had our darkest moments and we came out of it and won four on the trot and then lost four on the trot			0
‘ we have got to find that level of sustainability and consistency in our levels of results and performances			0
they have got to find out and i have got to find out if we are capable of that			0
’ @entity17 will be given until saturday morning to prove his fitness to @entity0 ahead of the @entity7 clash @entity0 added : ‘ as a manager , sustainable progress is what it ’s all about			2
‘ you can be too slow and lose your job and then too quick and falter and then lose your job			0
if you build slowly and steadily and success is improved year in , year out then you can eventually get to stage where @entity1 becomes like an @entity92 is at the moment			2
‘ that ’s not only sustainability but looking at cup competitions and winning a trophy and getting into @entity98 and that can happen in this season and in the next two or three years perhaps depending upon the investment and the improvement of the squad			0
