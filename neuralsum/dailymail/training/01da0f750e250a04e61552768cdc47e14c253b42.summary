by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has already opened talks with @entity4 with regard to signing a new deal			1
last week @entity4 confirmed they had signed @entity7 to a new long - term contract , believed to run through to the end of 2016			1
the @entity11 manufacturing giant is now eager to extend its partnership with @entity2 , who still has another 18 months to run of his initial three - year agreement			1
the 29 - year - old stated he was ' very , very happy in the team ' , adding he felt it would be ' very difficult for me to see myself anywhere else ' given his association with @entity4 since the age of 13			1
@entity2 , however , kept the door slightly ajar for a move elsewhere as he said : ' but you never know what the future may hold			2
' @entity2 , @entity7 and @entity4 are currently @entity34 's dream ticket as the duo have won nine of the 10 races so far this season , whilst the team is firmly on course for the constructors ' title			1
although there have been moments of consternation for motorsport boss @entity47 to contend with , the @entity43 is eager to retain @entity2 beyond the end of 2015			2
' we are already sitting together and negotiating with @entity2 about a multi-year contract , ' said @entity47 , speaking to @entity43 's @entity52 newspaper			1
' @entity2 is a fixed part of the team , and i would hope for a long time to come			1
' second fiddle : but he currently playing catchup to team - mate @entity7 in the standings @entity60 signs @entity4 extension comeback : @entity2 came from the back of the grid to finish third at @entity65 on sunday any decision from @entity67 may be some way off yet , and much could depend on the outcome of this year 's title fight with @entity7			1
@entity2 has fallen 14 points adrift after @entity7 's win on home soil at @entity65 on sunday , although the @entity74 deserves full credit for limiting the damage after a stirring drive from 20th to third			1
a qualifying crash following a right - front brake disc failure again put @entity2 on the back foot in his duel with @entity7			1
@entity2 required acupuncture ahead of the race , and this week will also have physiotherapy prior to competing at a circuit he has made his own in recent years , the @entity87 just outside @entity88			1
@entity2 has won four @entity90 @entity89 from seven attempts , and the last two in particular , so completing a hat - trick to go into the sport 's summer break on a high would provide him with a huge tonic			2
' i 'm not going there with any concern about maintaining my record , ' said @entity2			2
' i 'm simply going there to win , as was the case ahead of the weekend in @entity11			0
i went into it with the right mentality and preparation			0
' but things happened and got in the way			0
that 's not to say i want luck or wish for luck			0
i never pray or wish for that			0
i just do n't want anything like that			0
' all i hope is the car sticks together so i can go out there and do the job			0
' teamwork : @entity2 speaks with @entity4 boss @entity47 smash : @entity2 recovered in @entity11 after a heavy crash in practice before the race to that end , @entity2 would love nothing more than three trouble - free days as he feels he deserves as much given his problems of late			1
qualifying especially has proven a thorn in his side of late as he has had to contend with issues or his own failings at the last five race saturdays			0
' a couple of times it 's been down to me not getting the lap , ' said @entity2			2
' i think i would have got the lap in @entity11 , but then who knows			0
the car broke down , but that 's okay , there are many more races to go			0
' with a laugh , @entity2 said : " i 'm certainly not planning on starting at the back in @entity143 ! ' but a clean weekend is what i 'm aiming for , to come away from there with some strong points ahead of the break when i 'll get some rest going into the last part of the season			2
' with a huge grin he then added : ' maybe i 'll go visit some @entity153 , or a @entity154 and rub his belly or whatever			0
' i 'll try all the different religions to see if i can get some luck			0

@entity2 has already opened talks over a new @entity4 deal
