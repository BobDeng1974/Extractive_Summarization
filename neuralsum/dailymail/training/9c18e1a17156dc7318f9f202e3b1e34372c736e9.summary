@entity0 is just 14 years old			2
a softly - spoken boy with thick - rimmed black glasses and a mournful air , he seems gentle and is clearly devoted to his mother			2
and yet , @entity0 is one of 150 boys living in @entity6 , a wing of @entity7 in @entity8 that specialises in the treatment of young sex offenders			1
like an estimated 70,000 juvenile offenders across the @entity12 , @entity0 , and his room mate @entity13 , 15 , is a ' chomo ' - a child molester			1
' my friends tell me they will kill me if they see me again			2
i feel like people see a label on me now because of that one thing			2
' the child of a single mother and an absent father , @entity0 's childhood was blighted by his mother 's drug addiction which she funded by turning to prostitution			2
and his story is by no means unique			2
' the majority of the boys have come from very difficult backgrounds , ' explains @entity38 , who spent a month inside the prison filming new documentary , @entity41			1
' most of them are n't bad eggs			2
they do it out of bad decision making			2
' both @entity0 and @entity13 are taking part in a programme aimed at rehabilitating the boys and turning their lives around			1
if they pass the nine - month course , they will be released and have their record wiped clean			1
if not , they will stay in the facility indefinitely			2
tough : @entity7 houses 150 teenage ' chomos ' - slang for child molester troubled : @entity0 , left , and room mate @entity13 , right , have both endured troubled childhoods the programme , which is overseen by an army of counsellors , has produced a re-offending rate of around seven per cent - half the amount of recidivism found among adult sex offenders			1
' they 're in here for sexual misconduct with animals , young children , ' explains one @entity76 counsellor in an attempt to explain how the children end up on the programme			1
' they 're having sex with animals , their younger sisters , each other ... some of them are watching porn at a very young age			1
that has to have something to do with it			2
' sadly , the treatment does n't always work as the case of @entity90 , @entity76 's most notorious sex offender , reveals			1
@entity91 , now 18 , has been in sex offender treatment programmes on three separate occasions and was first sent to the facility aged 15			1
each time he has been released , he has re-offended and has to be kept in segregation and monitored 24 hours a day , thanks to his predilection for grooming the younger boys			1
he complains to staff and constantly asks to be moved to a room where he can watch the other boys in the shower			1
tough : boys are allowed out of their wing for an hour of exercise in the prison grounds once a day notorious : @entity90 , 18 , is kept segregated due to his predilection for grooming younger boys nevertheless , he insists that should he leave , other children will be safe from him			1
' i have been in here three times because they do n't think i can control my sexual issues , ' he explains			1
one of the worst things i did was sexually abuse a kid to get revenge on my mentor because i wanted him fired			1
' @entity91 says his own history of abuse , which began when he was first placed in care aged six , has left him a troubled individual			1
' i 've been abused by my biological family and in care , ' he reveals			2
' i 've had a pretty rough life			2
everyone says i 'm really messed up in the head			2
' @entity91 , who expects to be released before he is 22 , will leave @entity76 knowing that if he re-offends again , his next stop will be adult jail			1
for the others , among them 15 - year - old @entity13 , release means the chance to attempt to build a ' normal ' life			0
' my family has forgiven me , ' he says			0
' do i deserve it ? probably not			0
i just want to live a normal life			0
i want to be a marine biologist			0
' @entity13 , who says he first saw pornography online aged eight , is the child of a loving mother and an abusive father , a man who disappeared three years ago when allegations of abuse were laid at his door			1
gentle : @entity0 , seen with his friend @entity13 , is devoted to his mother and wants to feel cared for troubled : @entity13 was himself a victim of violent abuse at the hands of his father his father , who he first met aged five , would physically abuse him during visits to his house and once threw him into a washing machine and switched it on			1
' for me , being abused made it feel like something was missing in me , ' he says			0
' i call it the hole			0
my dad would use corporal punishment , he 'd make me stand in the corner all night			0
' it 's crazy not being able to live with myself because all the time i was a little kid , i 'd be thinking , did i do something to deserve this ? am i really this bad that he has to do this stuff to me ? ' but , as with @entity0 , @entity175 's troubled childhood resulted in sexual abuse of others , in his case , attacking a younger female family member over a period of four years			1
children like @entity13 and @entity0 are helped by counsellors , among them @entity183 who is in charge of dealing with the younger boys			1
' the counsellors were saints , ' says @entity38			0
' miss @entity183 helps these kids through really dark times			0
counsellors are like surrogate parents for these kids			0
' for her part , @entity183 , who has heard some of the most harrowing stories imaginable , says she has been desensitised to much of what she hears - and says that is a good thing			0
' at first i got chills but with time , i 've become desensitised , ' she explains			0
' i think that helps them [ the children ] because i 'm not looking at them with shock all the time			0
' but not all of the young inmates are easy to deal with			1
' the inward kids are the ones you have to pay the most attention to , ' she says			0
' they 're the ones you have to watch			0
' one child who does n't appear to be any sort of mastermind is @entity0 , who @entity183 describes as ' one of my most interesting boys			1
' all @entity0 really wants is to see his mother			0
' it 's been five months since i saw my mom , ' he says			1
' i 'm alone up here , so i want to see her more			0
' sometimes i blame her for not being a better parent			0
but she 's never given up on me			0
without her , i 'd be much worse			0
' @entity0 , who says his crime was motivated by wanting ' someone to care for me ' , also has big plans for the future			0
' i 've always wanted to be a scientist , ' he says , smiling shyly			0
' i want to do something with science			0
maybe that is my calling			0
