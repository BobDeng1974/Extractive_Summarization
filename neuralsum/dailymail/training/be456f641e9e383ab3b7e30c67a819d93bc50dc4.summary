did you see those photographs of all the black @entity3 taxis blocking a bridge over the @entity5 as the drivers protested about a phone app for ordering cabs on line robbing them of business ? notice anything ? not one of them had an @entity15 flag flying from its window			1
those red and white standards used to be the first sign of @entity20 fever in our country			2
not flying the flag : the @entity24 flies on the mall but the @entity26 is nowhere to be seen on the taxis as soon as you stepped into one of those taxis the driver would ask you what you thought of @entity15 's chances			1
most of them were bullish about reaching at least the semi-finals			0
in fact , i did not see a single @entity15 flag on a black taxi before boarding a flight to @entity42 , with the first game against @entity44 in @entity45 barely two days away			1
nor an @entity46 - app or any other mini-cab come to that			2
neither have i chanced upon any in the streets of central @entity3			0
as for the shops , not a glimmer of patriotic paraphernalia			2
and at stores like @entity55 , which used to be brimming with all manner of @entity15 and general football memorabilia before and during @entity58 past , are devoid of so much as a key ring			1
never mind coffee mugs and tea towels			0
as i passed through @entity63 at @entity64 ... not a flag in sight			0
nor a single @entity15 shirt			2
nor do you see many on the buses , the @entity71 or on the pavements			0
at a guess , replica kit sales are well short of the usual			0
it is estimated that fewer @entity15 fans are heading for @entity42 than for any @entity20 since @entity77 in 1962			1
the distance and the cost may have something to do with that but the @entity15 lads on tour used to save up for four years , dip into their overdrafts and get there somehow			2
the crazy , gung - ho optimism of so many of these tournaments was wildly misplaced and perhaps the fans have largely given up hope			2
but the gloom and doom is uncharacteristic of us as a nation			0
where has all the @entity94 - ishness gone ? @entity96 has a young team full of hope			1
they may not win but i for one give them a 50 - 50 chance of getting out of the group - at @entity44 's expense by the way - and reaching their par for the @entity20 course : the quarter finals			1
a bit of @entity20 fervour ? a taxi driver waves a replica @entity20 during the protest against ' @entity46 ' the tv companies , desperate to build viewership in return for their @entity20 investment , have scoured the land for signs of @entity15 fervour			1
they have filmed some pubs decked out in red and white regalia and the odd street bedecked with bunting			0
but they are hard to find , as are invitations to street parties			0
perhaps my low - key @entity3 experience reflects more on the capital itself , with its rising proportion of immigrants and its political and social life dominated by a metropolitan elite whose snobbishness would be discomfited by displays of common enthusiasm			0
but the taxi drivers ? most of them are good old @entity3 boys			1
if they have lost the faith , hopefully @entity144 will at least do enough in @entity42 to win them back			1
difficult to find : this house in @entity148 is decked out in red and white but it is in the minority a publication * now on the book stands comes as a poignant reminder of when @entity15 ruled the game it gave to the world - but also how long it is since that solitary triumph			1
veteran @entity20 reporter @entity158 has re-published his tome every four years since @entity161 led the boys of summer ' 66 to our only @entity20			0
sadly , although @entity158 brings the broader @entity20 story skillfully up to date , he has not yet had any need to change its title : @entity15 's last glory			1
@entity168 thinking : sir @entity169 ( left , celebrating in 1966 ) , writes in @entity158 's updated book ' hopefully i will have to do that before my time is up			0
on this occasion he has to settle for a very good foreword by the only man to have scored a hat - trick in a @entity178 , our own sir @entity169			0
* @entity15 's last glory , by @entity158 , pavilion Â£ 8.99			2

@entity144 need to win back the fans
taxi drivers are usually the *barometer* of football fever
there 's a marked drop in the *appearances* of patriotic *paraphenalia*
@entity96 's @entity15 will probably get to the quarter - finals
