@entity0 is sticking by his comments that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households			1
the government wants to reintroduce twice - yearly indexation of the fuel excise , a budget measure opposed by both @entity9 and the @entity10 who say it will hit low - income families the hardest			1
but the treasurer disagrees , saying there there was a clear trend that showed the higher the household income , the more fuel taxes were paid			0
that comment drew a rebuke from @entity9 leader @entity31 and some welfare groups			2
' are you serious , @entity0 ? are you really the cigar chomping , @entity35 of @entity37 politics where you 're saying that poor people do n't drive cars ? ' mr @entity31 told reporters in @entity40			1
@entity42 chief executive @entity41 said the treasurer was making a massive assumption			0
' in fact many low - income households are heavily dependent on quite old motor vehicles that are not terribly fuel efficient as their only means of transport , ' he told @entity52			2
the @entity53 wants to reintroduce twice - yearly indexation of the fuel excise on wednesday , @entity0 brushed off the controversy surrounding his comments cheaper housing was also often located in areas that were poorly served by transport , but far from jobs , so they have to travel long distances at times			1
when quizzed by reporters in @entity40 later on wednesday , mr @entity0 was unrepentant , labelling the reaction to his comments as ' hysteria '			1
' the fact is that there is a clear trend in @entity37 - the higher the household income the more fuel taxes are paid by the household , ' he said			0
his office also released figures that showed average weekly expenditure on petrol ranges from $ 16.36 for those on the lowest income to $ 53.87 among the highest incomes			0
households in relatively disadvantaged areas were also less likely to own motor vehicles than those in relatively advantaged areas			0
where motor vehicles were owned , households in relatively disadvantaged areas were most likely to own only one car whereas households in relatively advantaged areas were more likely to have two or more motor vehicles .			0
