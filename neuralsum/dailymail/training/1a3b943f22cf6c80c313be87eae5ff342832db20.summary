@entity0 may yet remain at @entity1 , despite strong reports linking him with a move away from the club			1
the @entity7 international 's contract at the @entity8 expires at the end of the season			2
and after talks with @entity1 over a new deal continued to drag the 29 - year - old looked set for pastures new			1
@entity0 could yet sign a new @entity1 deal despite being linked with a move away from the club @entity0 arrived at the @entity8 in 2010 from @entity18 for a reported fee of £ 26 million the @entity7 midfielder 's contract situation has attracted interest from clubs both at home and abroad but @entity25 understands both club and player have not yet given up on reaching an agreement that would see @entity0 extend his stay in @entity30			1
negotiations are set to re-open in the near future and much will depend upon assurances over playing time			0
while this season @entity0 has made 11 first team starts in the @entity36 compared with 12 in the whole of last season , he is under no illusion that the impact of injuries and and non-availability of the likes of @entity44 and @entity45 have helped his cause			2
in @entity1 's last two matches @entity0 has started in his preferred central midfield position and would welcome more opportunities at the same spot			1
the player is known to have options at home and in @entity54 and @entity55			0
however , it is understood that signing a pre-contract deal with a foreign club is unlikely			0
regardless of how talks with @entity1 pan out , @entity0 is thought to be keen to stay at the @entity8 for the rest of the season and to honour his previous deal			1
the fact that he is an @entity7 international available for free means he is in a strong position as he looks for a new deal at the age of 29 but playing time , rather than cash on the table , is thought to be the main incentive			2
it is understood that regular first - team football will be @entity0 's main priority when deciding his future meanwhile , @entity1 declined to comment on whether they have a plane on standby to bring @entity77 pair @entity44 and £ 25m new boy @entity78 home from the @entity80 should their side lose to @entity82 on wednesday night and be eliminated			1
the club are reluctant to discuss the prospect out of respect to the @entity77			0
should a defeat transpire , though , both would no doubt be welcomed into the fold by @entity89 ahead of saturday evening 's title race showdown with league leaders @entity92			0
@entity1 could recall midfielder @entity44 ( left ) from @entity77 duty if the elephants lose to @entity82 @entity44 and @entity78 ( pictured ) , who joined @entity1 earlier this month , are currently at the @entity80			0

@entity0 could yet extend his stay at @entity1
the 29 - year - old is out of contract in the *summer*
he has attracted interest from clubs both *domestic* and foreign clubs
playing regular first - team football is @entity0 's main priority
