@entity0 was jailed for fraudulently helping learner drivers pass their theory test a @entity4 interpreter was jailed today for helping more than 100 learner drivers cheat on their theory tests			1
@entity0 , 45 , charged £ 110 to get @entity8 speakers through the written part of the @entity11 driving test			1
a court heard @entity0 was cheating by telling candidates when to use ' dui ' the @entity8 word for ' yes ' on multiple choice questions			1
but bosses at the @entity18 became suspicious of the number of @entity4 learners queuing up to hire @entity0 for their theory tests			1
she was arrested at @entity23 theory test centre on 18 october 2012			1
an investigation team analysed a random sample of 27 recordings of @entity0 ’s translations and found they were all fraudulent			2
and the agency believes some candidates never bothered to learn the @entity30 because they knew @entity0 would get them through			1
@entity0 , of @entity23 , admitted making 27 fraudulent translations and asked for another 40 offences to be taken into account			2
she was jailed for 12 months at @entity34			1
@entity18 chiefs said it was in the process of tracing 94 people who used @entity0 to pass their theory test at a centre in the @entity42 capital			1
they will have their test pass certificates revoked and will have to sit their entire driving test again			0
the @entity18 ’s head of fraud and integrity , @entity45 , said : ' the driving test is there to ensure that all drivers have the skills and knowledge to use the roads safely and responsibly			2
' anyone who tries to circumvent this process is putting innocent road - users at risk			0
' this sentence sends a clear message that driving test fraud is a serious offence and will be dealt with accordingly			0
' the theory test which costs £ 31 is a series of multiple choice questions on a computer screen at an official driving test centre			1
the interpreter charged £ 110 to help @entity8 speakers pass the £ 31 theory test under current legislation learners whose first language is n’t @entity73 can use an interpreter on both the theory and practical driving tests			1
theory tests candidates can choose from an approved list of interpreters compiled by the @entity18			1
the candidate pays for the interpreter - who can charge as much as they like for their services			0
to become an approved by the @entity18 interpreter ’s must have a qualification from a recognised body and attach two references to their application			2
after their qualifications and references have been checked and approved they are free to charge candidates for their services			0
road safety minister @entity93 said drivers must have the correct skills before taking to the road @entity18 spokesman @entity97 said interpreter fraud was a ' serious problem '			2
he said : ' there are a relatively small number of tests conducted with interpreters			0
' when you look at the overall figures it is a serious problem but not widespread			0
' this is the third conviction in as many years of interpreter fraud			0
' earlier this year the government launched a consultation on proposals to withdraw foreign language support for driving test candidates			2
this was in response to concerns about potential road safety implications and the risk of fraud			0
road safety minister @entity93 said : ' we want to ensure that all drivers have the right skills to use our roads safely and responsibly			0
' we also want to keep test fees to a minimum for candidates , and i am not convinced that providing translations is the most effective use of resources			0
' there is a potential road safety risk of drivers not understanding important traffic updates or emergency information			0
' allowing interpreters on tests also presents the risk of fraud , for example if they are indicating the correct answers to theory test questions			1
' the government ’s response to the consultation is expected in the autumn .			0
