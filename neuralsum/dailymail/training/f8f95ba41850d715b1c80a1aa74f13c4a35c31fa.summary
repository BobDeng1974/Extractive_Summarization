the corncockle is a dainty pink or purple flowering plant that can be potentially fatal if ingested a group of @entity4 unwittingly planted poisonous wild flowers in a public park as part of a project backed by the @entity11 ’s @entity10 programme			1
council groundsmen were called in to clear the rare toxic corncockles after being alerted by an amateur photographer			1
around 230,000 packets of mixed seeds were given away as part of the @entity19 campaign to encourage members of the public to plant native wild flowers , meaning they could have sprung up in other public areas			1
although touching the plants carries a low risk of harm , ingesting the plant or its seeds can lead to severe stomach pain , vomiting , diarrhoea , dizziness , slow breathing and even death			1
the @entity4 sowed the seeds in @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , in may			1
@entity38 , who identified the corncockles , said : ‘ i looked in my flower book and it said these were scant and very rare , so i did a bit more research on them			2
when i googled them i found out they could be deadly			0
’ the corncockle is a dainty pink or purple flowering plant			2
at one time , they were a common sight in fields , but modern agricultural methods have all but eliminated them from the wild – hence their inclusion in the ‘ @entity59 ’ scheme			0
cultivated corncockle seeds are sold widely so it is not uncommon to see them in gardens			0
@entity10 worked with the @entity63 in @entity64 to promote the seed packets during an episode of the programme earlier this year			1
@entity64 arranged the production and distribution of the seed packets , which were sent out to members of the public in march			2
professor @entity72 , director of the @entity73 , assured gardeners that the plants are not high risk			0
she said : ‘ this plant , like many we have in our gardens , does contain compounds that can be toxic if eaten in large amounts or eaten frequently over a period of time			2
if eaten by a child , they would most likely be sick or complain of a stomach ache			0
there is no evidence that eating a few seeds would cause acute toxicity			0
’ @entity97 , of the @entity98 , added : ‘ merely touching this plant is a very low risk indeed			0
we know of no instances of harm occurring from this plant in gardens			0
’ a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ earlier this year @entity10 worked with @entity64 on their @entity19 campaign and the packs of seeds in the give - away were provided and distributed by @entity64			1
