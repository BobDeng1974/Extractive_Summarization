@entity0 has admitted @entity2 's players are fighting for their futures after a season in which he says they have let themselves down			1
@entity2 ’s dreams of winning the @entity6 evaporated spectacularly on thursday when they were beaten 5 - 2 by @entity7 and now they have nothing to play for other than trying to salvage some respectability in the @entity10			1
it is a far cry from what @entity0 and his team - mates anticipated at the beginning of the campaign but the performance in @entity17 was indicative of how wretched @entity2 's form has been			1
he accepts they have not been good enough and owe their supporters a response			2
@entity0 challenges with with @entity7 's @entity23 during the 5 - 2 @entity6 defeat @entity2 's @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity0 stand dejected after conceding @entity28 left back @entity0 admits that @entity2 players are fighting for their future after difficult season they now have nine games left to move away from the fringes of the relegation battle , starting tomorrow at @entity36 , and @entity0 has accepted if the situation does not improve , there is likely to be a summer of change at @entity40			1
‘ you have got your own personal standards , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in the last few seasons , we have been striving for something towards the end			2
this is now a bit different			2
we have got some important games coming up and we are in a position we do n’t want to be in			0
‘ the sooner we get a couple of wins on the board , the better			0
but it is about your own personal standards			0
the boys have got to keep their standards up , you know ? with the way things have been going , you are playing for your future in some respects			0
that is a useful way of looking at it			0
’ a disconsolate @entity2 attempt to come to terms with the glut of goals they conceded @entity26 can only reflect on what might have been after conceding five goals on a dreadful evening @entity2 ’s capitulation summed up a miserable week for @entity74 clubs in @entity75 but , more than anything , reminded @entity78 ’s squad of the opportunity they had missed			1
there had been a feeling within the group that they could go all the way to @entity84 and it is crucial they now respond			0
‘ we have let ourselves down , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ they were the better team			0
we knew they would be better ( than they were at @entity40 ) this time around but we didn ’ t approach the game and think “ we ’ve got to sit back ”			0
‘ we were all thinking that we would push on			0
we had all the confidence in the world and i do n’t think anyone would have foreseen the way things have gone this season			1
we had been upbeat and positive and it just has n’t been a good season			2
