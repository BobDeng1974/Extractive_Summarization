the @entity0 is struggling to recruit enough technical experts for a secretive psychological warfare unit intended to combat @entity4 ’s domination of the internet and social media			1
the specialised 77 @entity7 , launched with great fanfare in january in response to the jihadis ’ mastery of online propaganda , is in disarray after failing to enlist the right personnel			0
earlier this year , it was widely reported that the brigade would be made up of 2,000 social media and psychological warfare exponents who would enable @entity21 forces to fight wars ‘ in the information age ’			1
but @entity24 can reveal that even when fully operational , the brigade will number just 454 regular and reservist troops			1
and in a letter to his troops , the brigade ’s commander says he has failed to recruit enough ‘ talent ’ to challenge @entity32 ’s ascendency online			2
the @entity0 is struggling to recruit enough technical experts for a secretive psychological warfare unit intended to combat @entity4 ’s domination of the internet and social media ( stock image above ) brigadier @entity39 says he needs computer whizzkids skilled in ‘ social media , financial operations and counter-criminality ’ but admits that civilians with the relevant experience are not natural recruits for the @entity0			1
the role of these keyboard warriors was expected to include covertly leaking messages about @entity21 successes to the enemy , via platforms such as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , and contacting jihadis directly to spread false information			1
brigadier @entity39 ’s letter adds : ‘ we are potentially not attracting the broadest range of talent from across the nation			0
‘ capacities such as social media , financial operations and counter-criminality will need an increased diversity of talent , opinions , skills and viewpoints			0
members of @entity73 regularly post on social media and just two days ago @entity76 television network @entity75 was hacked by individuals claiming to belong to the group ‘ we may need to redesign our terms and conditions of service to attract those that have these skills			0
’ the letter suggests some reservist troops will lose their posts in @entity7 , while many soldiers do not know what roles they will be assigned			2
sources say this has led to a ‘ mutinous atmosphere ’ at the brigade ’s hq – @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97			0
last night , the @entity98 said reservists who lost their posts in 77 @entity7 will be offered alternative roles .			0
