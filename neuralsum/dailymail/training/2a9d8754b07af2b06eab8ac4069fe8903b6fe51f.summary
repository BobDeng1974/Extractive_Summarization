by @entity0 published : 13:43 est , 12 may 2012 updated : 13:43 est , 12 may 2012 time to go : @entity1 said it ' beggars belief ' that @entity4 was still in his job @entity1 tonight said it ' beggars belief ' that culture secretary @entity4 is still in his job after an email claimed he asked the @entity10 empire to help him stop a phone hacking inquiry			1
the @entity13 leader said today the ' accumulation of evidence ' about the minister 's close ties with @entity18 meant that his position was untenable			2
at the time the latest bombshell email was sent , mr @entity4 was supposed to be the independent arbiter who decided whether the company 's bid to buy out @entity25 was successful			2
the message asked @entity18 to ‘ advise him privately ’ as the @entity27 was engulfed in hacking allegations			1
the disclosure is another blow to mr @entity4 , already fighting to save his career over claims about his handling of the @entity34 ’ £ 8billion takeover bid			2
it also implicated @entity37 in the row for the first time			0
today mr @entity1 said that mr @entity4 had the @entity10 's interests and not the government 's interests at heart			0
' one of the reasons so many people hate politics so much right now is that they think politicians stand up for the wrong people , not the right people , ' he said			0
' this is a clear example of that - @entity4 was standing up for @entity10 , not for the public interest			0
' out of touch with the many			0
too close to the few			0
' in the email sent on june 27 last year , a @entity18 lobbyist told mrs @entity59 , then one of mr @entity10 ’s most senior @entity61 executives , that mr @entity4 was poised to make an ‘ extremely helpful ’ statement about their company ’s proposed acquisition of @entity25			1
@entity66 suggested the @entity4 would give a green light to the bid because he believes ‘ phone hacking has nothing to do with the media plurality issues ’			0
it also said mr @entity4 ‘ wants to prevent a public inquiry ’ into the culture of phone hacking at the @entity27			1
pressure : @entity59 , pictured at the @entity77 yesterday , received an email from @entity18 's @entity79 claiming @entity4 , right , was asking him for ' private advice ' the email raises questions about the @entity4 ’s close relationship with the @entity10 empire			1
mr @entity4 ’s special adviser @entity84 resigned last month after it emerged that he secretly passed mr @entity66 privileged information on @entity18 ’s takeover bid for @entity25 while mr @entity4 was supposed to be ruling on the bid as an impartial , quasi-judicial watchdog			1
mr @entity4 , who has insisted he acted with propriety throughout and did not know what mr @entity84 was doing , yesterday insisted the latest email was ‘ completely inaccurate ’			2
his spokesman pointed out that soon after the email exchange took place , the @entity4 asked the watchdog @entity96 to rule on whether the phone hacking scandal should affect the @entity25 bid			1
mr @entity66 has admitted that his repeated references to ‘ jh ’ in emails in fact referred to information obtained from his special adviser , and @entity100 officials suggest he exaggerated his contacts to impress his bosses			0
proof ? the email which apparently proves @entity4 asked for advice from @entity10 's empire in the email mr @entity66 , @entity18 ’s head of public affairs for @entity114 , told mrs @entity59 that mr @entity4 ‘ will be making references to phone hacking in his statement on @entity118 [ the codename for the @entity25 bid ] this week ’			1
he said the @entity4 believed police were ‘ pursuing things thoroughly and phone hacking has nothing to do with the media plurality issue ’ , a position mr @entity66 described as ‘ extremely helpful ’			0
he claimed mr @entity4 wanted to widen the remit of a parliamentary inquiry and ‘ prevent a public enquiry ’			1
‘ @entity131 [ @entity4 ] is now starting to looking to phone - hacking / practices more thoroughly and has asked me to advise him privately in the coming weeks and guide his and no 10 ’s positioning , ’ the email concluded			2
tough day : mrs @entity59 leaves in a @entity135 after giving evidence to @entity77 three days later , on june 30 , mr @entity4 told mps that while the phone hacking allegations were ‘ very serious ’ they were ‘ not material ’ to his consideration of the @entity25 bid			1
days later , however , the @entity142 revealed that @entity144 ’s voicemail messages had been targeted by the @entity27 – a disclosure which led to @entity18 dropping its bid for @entity25 , mrs @entity59 ’s resignation and the government setting up the @entity150 inquiry , although the revelations have now been discredited			1
@entity37 has refused to refer the allegations against mr @entity4 to a sleaze watchdog which oversees the ministerial code until after he too has given evidence to @entity150			2
mrs @entity59 , giving evidence yesterday , said that after briefly discussing the @entity25 bid with mr @entity156 at a dinner in december 2010 , she had a more substantial conversation with mr @entity159 at a restaurant that month			0
the following day she emailed mr @entity66 saying that mr @entity159 had expressed ‘ total bafflement ’ at @entity96 ’s latest response to the bid			0
will he be seeing @entity59 ? @entity164 arrives at @entity165 from the @entity166 yesterday after his former colleague 's appearance before the @entity77			0

mr @entity4 ' asked @entity18 to advise him privately ' as he ' wanted to prevent a hacking inquiry '
@entity172 came during @entity59 evidence to @entity77
@entity13 deputy leader also @entity175 calls for @entity4 to be sacked
email was from @entity18 lobbyist @entity79 to @entity59 on june 27 2011 before @entity144 hacking revelations
