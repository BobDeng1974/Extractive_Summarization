they state he must hold a @entity25 vote on the issue before the election in 2015 to prove he means it – and to expose @entity29 and @entity30 , who have made clear they oppose it			1
the latest @entity22 referendum revolt comes after an opinion poll suggested mr @entity4 ’s @entity36 rival @entity37 would wipe out @entity39 ’s six - point lead if the @entity41 mayor was @entity12 leader			2
and well - placed sources say 25 of the 46 mps needed to trigger a leadership contest have now written to @entity45 , chairman of the party ’s @entity46 of @entity11 , asking for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister			0
in the letter to mr @entity4 , written by @entity54 mp @entity53 but understood to bear the signatures of one in three @entity12 mps , the rebels tell him to enshrine his referendum pledge in law now – or be accused of ‘ broken promises ’			1
mr @entity4 had hoped to silence his @entity61 critics in january by vowing to hold a referendum on @entity21 membership of the @entity22 if he wins the next election			1
