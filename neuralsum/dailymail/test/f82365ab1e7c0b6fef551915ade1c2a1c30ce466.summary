it is not often you hear this said but the goalkeeper really should have scored			2
deep in injury time , with @entity9 ’s @entity8 journey about to end , @entity4 appeared for a corner and found the ball at his feet as it dropped from a jumble of players 12 yards out			1
@entity4 , oddly , had time and , even more strangely given the melee in the area , he had space , too			1
he had the whole goal to aim at			2
as it happened , his right - foot shot on the turn was struck well enough but it was straight at @entity24 goalkeeper @entity23 , who managed to parry the ball and then grab it as it threatened to spin over the line			1
we do not blame @entity4 , of course			1
but he will wake this morning knowing that a peculiar and romantic part in @entity8 folklore could have been his			1
@entity24 celebrated a place in the @entity8 semi-finals after beating @entity9 , setting up a @entity36 encounter with @entity37 @entity38 scored the decisive goal for @entity24 with 20 minutes to play in their quarter - final replay at @entity42 @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 celebrate after @entity24 secured their place in the @entity8 semi-finals @entity24 manager @entity47 celebrates with @entity43 after his team ousted the @entity50 outfit @entity9 players look dejected while @entity24 celebrate their progression after a hard - fought quarter - final replay @entity9 goalkeeper @entity4 almost scored a dramatic late equaliser when he went up for a stoppage - time corner @entity9 defender @entity56 sinks to the floor at the final whistle after @entity9 's elimination @entity9 : @entity4 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity56 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 65 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			1

referee : @entity93 ( @entity94 )			0
@entity9 may not have gone on to win			0
they were losing 1 - 0 at the time and a goal so late on would only have taken them in to extra-time			1
nevertheless , @entity24 will go on to a semi-final date with @entity37 knowing that they were almost part of one of the great cup stories — and not in a good way			1
@entity9 boss @entity104 had looked ready to celebrate the unlikeliest of goals			0
he said : ‘ i think it was more shock that he managed to do that and turn			0
it was an unbelievable turn from him , a last roll of the dice			0
to have pushed @entity24 like that over two games and still have a chance like that means there ’s nothing but praise for my players			1
’ over the course of the piece , @entity24 deserved their win			1
they were not wholly convincing and will need to improve markedly if they are to win this competition or make another desperate late dart towards the @entity127 places			0
nevertheless , they dominated the majority of the possession and defended manfully when they had to			0
without their two best defenders — the suspended pair @entity132 and @entity133 — @entity24 reverted to a back four and then lost @entity79 to injury			1
however , the makeshift pair of @entity78 and @entity44 stepped up and deserve credit			0
toure was wretched in the @entity140 defeat at @entity141 at the weekend but was excellent here			0
at times , experience counts for much			0
so does timing , of course , and @entity146 ’s was excellent on wednesday			0
with 20 minutes to go , this was a game that looked as though it may be about to swing towards @entity9			0
@entity38 watches his shot find the bottom corner of the @entity9 goal to give @entity24 the lead with 20 minutes to play the @entity155 's shot flicks the inside of the far post before nestling in the back of the net at @entity42 @entity38 was mobbed by his team - mates after scoring what proved to be @entity24 's winner in the tie @entity9 goalkeeper @entity4 had a chance in the dying stages to force extra-time , but his shot was saved @entity83 , pictured being closed down by @entity9 's @entity60 , returned to the @entity24 starting line - up @entity24 winger @entity82 tries to elude the challenge from @entity9 's @entity60 @entity9 's @entity68 beats @entity43 to the ball as he forces a header towards the @entity24 goal reading vs @entity141 sat 18 april , 5.20pm @entity37 vs @entity24 sunday 19 april , 3pm ( both ties to be played at @entity36 ) having just thrown on their big forward @entity66 — a player who had caused @entity24 so much trouble in the first game a month ago — the @entity50 team were beginning to seriously trouble their opponents			1
within a minute of his arrival , @entity66 outmuscled @entity43 in the middle of the field and released @entity67 , who had to be tackled desperately by @entity44			2
then , from the ensuing corner , @entity23 was forced to come and palm the ball away rather desperately under pressure			2
for @entity104 and his team , it looked as though the perfect storm was brewing			0
@entity24 had enjoyed huge swathes of possession but had most of their approach play floundered against @entity9 ’s defensive barricades manned by the exceptional @entity56 and @entity61			1
@entity24 goalkeeper @entity23 makes a save onto the post to deny @entity68 giving @entity9 the lead @entity9 's @entity67 is clipped by @entity24 defender @entity80 after evading the @entity196 's challenge now , with the last quarter of the game upon them , @entity9 were scenting blood only for @entity38 to draw their sting with one of the few moments of stardust quality @entity24 managed all night			1
seeing a 70th minute corner come back to him from a defender , @entity38 had the awareness to lay the ball off to @entity43 and then make a move towards the return			1
it was this that created the space and the rest — the control and shot across goal in to the corner — was down purely to confidence , touch and purpose			1
these three qualities had been missing from much of @entity24 ’s play			1
@entity83 , for example , was wretched			0
for him every second touch was a tackle and young @entity82 did not do an awful lot better			0
@entity24 's @entity155 midfielder @entity38 tries to unlock the @entity9 defence as @entity56 stands him up @entity44 watches on after @entity9 goalkeeper @entity4 makes a save during the first half at @entity42 @entity69 attempts a shot at goal in the second half , but it was blocked by @entity24 defender toure @entity24 goalkeeper @entity23 punches the ball clear as @entity9 's @entity66 attempts to head the ball @entity24 , though , do have players of high class and when people like @entity38 are around the keys to the jail cell are never far from reach			1
afterwards , @entity9 manager @entity104 did have a complaint to make			0
at the start of the second half , @entity23 made a diving save from @entity67 and then , from the corner , an even better one from a @entity68 header			2
replays showed that the ball may have brushed @entity45 ’s arm before it reached the @entity24 goalkeeper			1
if it did , though , it did not deviate			0
there is no way that referee @entity93 could have spotted it			0
it would have taken cricket ’s @entity256 to reveal the thinnest of outside edges and as such it was hard to feel too much empathy with @entity104			0
@entity67 steps away from a challenge from @entity24 midfielder @entity45 during the quarter - final replay @entity24 manager @entity47 and @entity9 boss @entity104 talk in the technical area @entity42 was sold out for the quarter - final replay after the initial tie at @entity268 last month ended goalless on the whole , his team were excellent			1
so , too , were the home crowd who have rather criminally been deprived of nights like this since their club ’s ownership changed hands four - and - half years ago			2
just as they did in the first game , @entity9 struggled for prolonged possession but still scared @entity24 at times			2
@entity69 , for example , should have scored with a header in the first half			2
@entity24 , for their part , lived on half chances			2
they are not fluent at the moment			0
they are in the last four , though			0
had the goalkeeper taken better aim , it may have been different .			0

@entity38 scored in the 70th minute for @entity24 at @entity42
the @entity155 found the bottom corner of @entity4 's goal in @entity8 quarter - final replay
the first tie between the two sides at @entity268 last month ended in a goalless draw
@entity24 to face @entity37 in semi-final at @entity36 on sunday , april 19
