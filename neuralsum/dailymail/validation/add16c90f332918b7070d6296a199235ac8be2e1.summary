holiday costs in eurozone countries are looking significantly cheaper this year			2
on friday , the pound was worth € 1.38 – which for @entity4 holidaymakers heading to , say , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 is the most favourable rate for more than seven years			1
it ’s around 14 per cent better than this time last year , and 20 per cent better than five years ago			1
holidaymakers booking a village in the @entity13 can save more than £ 200 compared with last year put more graphically , if that villa in the @entity13 you ’re looking at costs € 2,000 ( £ 1,450 ) a week to rent , it ’s £ 231 cheaper than it was in 2014 and £ 353 cheaper than in 2010			1
likewise , a meal for two in @entity19 with a € 100 ( £ 72 ) price tag costs roughly £ 12 less than this time last year , and £ 18 less than in 2010			1
here are some issues that the better pound / euro exchange rate raises – but remember that if you use cards to get cash out of overseas atms , settle hotel and restaurant bills and make purchases , the actual exchange rate wo n’t be quite as good , due to the banks taking commission			1
holidaymakers may get a better deal by booking direct , in euros , as most prices were fixed last year book direct ? most holiday companies will have fixed their prices with hoteliers and villa owners last year , when the pound was weaker against the euro			1
this means you may well get a better deal by booking direct , in euros			0
that said , i know of a number of operators and villa agencies that have recently lowered prices to take into account the better exchange rate , and tailor - made arrangements may be based on current exchange rates			1
so it ’s worth doing diy vs package price comparisons			2
also bear in mind that you get better financial protection and back - up when you book a package			0
if you do book direct , to be sure of benefiting from the current good exchange rate , you need to pay in full now rather than putting down a deposit or paying on arrival / departure			1
the rate may be even better in a few months ’ time , but of course it may have worsened			0
you could hedge your bets by obtaining some ( but not all ) of your spending money now buy euros now ? the pound was worth about € 1.40 a week ago , but by friday it had fallen slightly			1
no one knows what it will do next , so if you buy euros now , you ’re taking a gamble			0
but you could hedge your bets by obtaining some ( but not all ) of your spending money now			0
consider doing so with a pre-paid euro currency card – the exchange rate used will be whatever it is on the day you upload the funds			1
the @entity86 ( ukash.com ) has very competitive exchange rates and charges no fees for making purchases or cash withdrawals			0
a driving holiday on the continent ? the combination of more favourable exchange rates and lower oil prices means that filling up the car in eurozone countries is costing @entity4 motorists a lot less than a year ago			1
according to a @entity107 report , when converted into pounds , the price of a litre of unleaded petrol in @entity5 , @entity7 , @entity6 , @entity104 and @entity105 is down year - on - year by at least 20 per cent			1
in many @entity110 countries , fuel is also markedly cheaper than in the @entity4 – about 10p less per litre of unleaded in @entity5 than in the @entity4			2
@entity112 is an attractive destination for @entity4 as the @entity115 koruna has plummeted against sterling beyond the eurozone exchange rates have also improved significantly for @entity4 travellers heading to some @entity110 countries outside the eurozone			0
notoriously expensive @entity122 is looking more affordable			0
compared with this time two years ago , the @entity124 krone and @entity126 krona are about 25 per cent weaker against the pound			2
you might also want to consider a break to @entity112 : the @entity115 koruna has plummeted over 20 per cent against sterling since spring 2013			0
but if you ’re thinking of heading to the @entity132 this year , things are not looking so rosy			0
the strength of the @entity132 economy means that the pound is weaker against the dollar than at any time since june 2010			2
worth a paltry $ 1.47 on friday , the pound has dropped by more than ten per cent from 12 months ago – bumping up accommodation and day - to - day costs			2
bear in mind that it ’s not just in the @entity142 where the strong dollar is making things pricier for @entity4 visitors			0
the same is true in other holiday spots where currencies are pegged to the @entity132 dollar , such as @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 in the @entity152 , and @entity153 .			0

the pound **'s** value against the euro on friday was strongest in seven years
the pound **'s** worth of € 1.38 is 14 per cent better than this time last year
it means a villa in the south of @entity5 worth € 2,000 ( £ 1,450 ) is £ 231 cheaper
compare @entity167 vs package prices to ensure you *'re* getting the best value
with the exchange rate and low oil prices , fill up the car for a road trip
