by @entity1 reporter published : 04:46 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 05:36 est , 24 december 2012 it 's the worldwide hit that 's spawned a thousand impersonators , some impressive , some downright shocking			1
and it is probably fair to say @entity7 news reader @entity6 's attempt at taking off @entity8 falls firmly in the latter category			1
the presenter broke into the worst type of dad - style dance to the smash hit during an online segment called ' what 2012 has taught me '			1
struggling to sing and dance in time with the music , ms @entity6 lurches from side - to - side as she tries to replicate @entity21 's horse - riding - style , seemingly struggling to move freely in her high heels as she belts out the words , ' @entity45 , sexy newsroom '			2
since being released in june by @entity48 act @entity21 , the hit has gone viral on the internet and reached number 1 in more than 30 countries			2
it has been viewed more than 1bn times on @entity54 , surpassing the site 's previous record with @entity58 's ' baby '			0
@entity8 refers to a district of @entity60 in @entity48			0
mercifully , the performance only lasts a few seconds before a slightly out of breath ms @entity6 admits defeat , blaming her dancing on her shoes and urging viewers not to try it with similar footwear			0
writing on her @entity29 feed later , the presenter seemed red - faced , saying : " good idea at the time but having watched it back it 's the most embarrassing thing i 've done since losing teenage drinking game # gangnam			1
" she later wrote : " thanks all # gangnam tribute tweets			0
think the consensus is do n't give up the day job ... so i wo n't ! " despite her fears , some viewers praised her effort , with @ _ @entity82 writing that ' it was absolute gold and possibly better than the original ' , while @ @entity85 said ' " hey sexy newsroom " is genius '			1
the popularity of the original song seems to know no bounds			0
by the end of october 2012 , the it had topped the music charts in countries including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and the @entity101 .			0
