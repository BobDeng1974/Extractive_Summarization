furious mps are in revolt over a decision to sell off the @entity4 silver – to save a ‘ paltry ’ £ 200 a week			1
some of the silver - plated cutlery used in @entity4 dining rooms could be sold to tourists as souvenirs and replaced by stainless steel knives and forks made in @entity11			2
a leaked report obtained by @entity13 reveals a plan to strip the new cutlery of the traditional @entity4 portcullis logo to deter visitors from stealing them			1
faded : the silver cutlery used in the dining rooms at the @entity4 a report accepted by the @entity21 says the move will save nearly £ 50,000 over the next five years – £ 10,000 a year or just under £ 200 a week			1
but @entity24 mp @entity23 , who is leading a battle to get the decision overturned , said : ‘ selling off @entity28 ’s family silver to save a paltry £ 10,000 a year is taking cheeseparing to ridiculous lengths			1
‘ there is a fundamental triviality about trying to save this sort of money when we are told we need to find £ 3 billion to restore the @entity36			0
‘ dignitaries who come here rightly expect to use silver - plated cutlery – not something one stop short of plastic forks and polystyrene cups			0

’ the officials say it would cost £ 72,400 over five years to keep the silver cutlery , including : fighting cause : @entity24 mp @entity23 is leading a battle to get the cutlery decision overturned by contrast , a new stainless steel set will cost £ 17,000 to buy and £ 6,800 to replace items that go missing			1

but that does not include the potential profit from selling some of the silver cutlery through commons gifts shops , which officials are looking at			0
the report says ‘ the best ’ of the silver cutlery will be kept for ‘ mp dining clubs , a member ’s wedding breakfast etc ’			1
