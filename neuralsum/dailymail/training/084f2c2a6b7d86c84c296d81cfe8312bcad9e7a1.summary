at the same time as the house blaze , a neighbour ’s car was torched			1
police are investigating the theory that the five may have died at the hands of yobs who have attacked other cars on their estate			2
three - year - old @entity28 , on the far right , survived and is being treated in hospital couple : doctor @entity31 survived with severe smoke inhalation while his wife @entity34 died yesterday officers revealed how @entity31 , 45 , ‘ fought hard ’ to rescue his family after an intense fire engulfed their end - of - terrace house as they slept			1

burned out : special fire crews attend the scene of a major house fire in @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 tragedy : four children died in the blaze , aged 13 , 11 , nine , and six			1
fire damage can be seen at the back of the house , on the brickwork and the walls are black with smoke among various lines of inquiry is the theory that the @entity31 family were singled out because of issues within the local @entity76 community , in which they were reportedly very popular			1
officers stressed , however , that there is no evidence of any racial motivation			0
another theory is that the @entity82 were not deliberately targeted , and the fire was either intended for previous tenants or started by arsonists who had attacked other cars on the estate			0
@entity88 reported seeing as many as four people in the street beforehand , and said other vehicles had been previously targeted by arsonists in the area			1
firefighters were called to the @entity82 ’ rented house in @entity57 , @entity58 , shortly before 2am yesterday			1
they found flames pouring from both front and back doors and temperatures inside in excess of 1,000 degrees @entity100			0

‘ he , as you would expect , is in severe shock			0
our work with dr @entity31 to establish some of the facts of this case will , inevitably , take time because of the emotional trauma he has suffered at the loss of his family			1
’ but he indicated that the answers to the mystery lay in the local community of @entity57 , and appealed to anyone with information to come forward			2
