staff at @entity1 were left red - faced after they gave a customer a receipt with a description of him and his friend - as ' gay guys ' so that colleagues knew where to deliver their food a bar has been forced to apologise to two customers who were given a receipt describing them as ' gay guys on stools '			1
@entity16 and his friend , both aged 26 , were left fuming when they were handed the bill at the end of their lunch			1
a waitress had written ' gay guys ... stools ' on it to show fellow staff where the pair were sitting when they delivered their food			1
he complained after spotting the line on the receipt at @entity1 , in @entity31 , @entity32 which was used as a guide to indicate to staff where customers were sitting			1
mr @entity16 has been left angered by the treatment he received calling it as ' unacceptable as racism			1
' he said : ' my friend spotted it first and said " i think the manager 's misconstrued our lunch " ' i obviously thought it was inappropriate			1
it took a while for it sink in			2
it was not insulting , it was just a shock			0
i would not expect it anywhere else			0
it 's as equally unacceptable as racism			1
' it 's not a bad thing to be called gay - although i 'm not and neither is my friend - but i think it 's prejudiced			1
it 's jumping to a conclusion without the need to do so			0
' mr @entity16 , who was visiting his home town from @entity62 , where he works as an aerospace engineer , claimed when he had complained in person at the bar he had not received an apology			1
instead the barman simply told him : ' sorry , there 's nothing i can do			0
' he then sought out owner mr. @entity70 and complained to him and @entity1 now says it has ' apologised unreservedly ' and said the member of staff involved , who had been working at the bar for a few days , has been disciplined			1
bar owner @entity70 said : ' we have apologised unreservedly			2
while it was completely wrong , i do n't feel it was prejudiced			0
' it was completely unprofessional and it is not what our business is about			0
unprofessional : owner @entity70 has apologised unreservedly and called the conduct of his staff ' unprofessional ' , he also says the waitress involved has been disciplined ' we understand why the two gentlemen concerned were offended and we have apologised to them unreservedly			1
' we have also disciplined the waitress concerned and put in place a procedure so it will not happen again			2
i would add that everyone is welcome at @entity1 's			2
' but equality campaigners have still criticised the behaviour as ' inappropriate			0
' @entity93 , of the sexual equality charity @entity95 , said better staff training was needed in order to prevent behaviour like this in the first place			0
he said : ' incidents like this highlight the importance of staff training			0
identifying customers by their perceived sexual orientation is unnecessary and could cause offence			0
' it 's right that the bar should apologise to the customers for this inappropriate behaviour			0
' a spokesperson from the @entity112 said : ' clearly this is an unacceptable and wrong stereotype made by a member of staff at the bar , but it is also a mistake which could cause great offence and upset to anyone involved , regardless of their sexuality			2
' we would welcome any business to contact us should they feel their staff require training on issues of equality , where we would be more than happy to assist			0
