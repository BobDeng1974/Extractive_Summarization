by @entity0 @entity2 coach @entity1 has revealed that @entity3 has been to see experts to determine why he has been vomiting during matches , but says there is no cause for alarm			1
@entity3 , 26 , was sick on the pitch during @entity11 's midweek friendly against @entity12 , and has been reported to have thrown up in other matches for his country and @entity2 previously			1
when asked about the subject on friday , @entity1 admitted the bouts of vomiting were ' not normal ' but played down the seriousness , adding that the issue has not been affecting the four - time @entity21 's ability to perform			2
unwell : @entity3 was physically sick on the pitch during @entity11 's draw against @entity12 under the weather : @entity3 reacts at the end of their international friendly against @entity12 back to the day job : @entity3 trains with @entity2 ahead of the @entity31 game ' i 've spoken with him and it happens regularly			1
i 'm not a specialist but i understand it 's not something normal , ' @entity1 said ahead of this weekend 's @entity38 trip to @entity31			1
' he 's even been to see specialists at certain times and a solution has n't been found yet , but there 's no cause for concern it does n't affect him doing his work at all			0
it 's something he 's had for some time			0
' @entity1 also heaped praise on ' irreplaceable ' defender @entity49 following the centre - back 's decision to leave the @entity53 giants			0
@entity49 , 35 , announced earlier this week that he would bid farewell to @entity2 at the end of the season after 19 years at the club in which he has made 593 first - team appearances - second only to current team - mate @entity60 in the club 's history - and helped them win 21 trophies			1
@entity1 said : ' i think he 's a footballer who is irreplaceable			0
i 'm probably not the best - placed person to comment on this , because i 've only worked with him for seven or eight months , but that 's enough to say what i said			0
in the spotlight : an irresponsible member of the crowd used a laser pointer to shine a light on @entity3 on the ball : @entity3 takes on @entity12 's @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 ' he 's the type of player that a club has only once every so often			1
life goes on at @entity2 , and the club will look for a replacement , but he 'll always be in everyone 's heads because he leaves an indelible mark			2
' @entity49 admits he does not know what his next step will be - save to take a bit of a break in the summer - but @entity1 has played down suggestions that the centre - back , who has won 100 caps for @entity96 , might immediately try his hand at football management			0
' it 's not that i do n't see him as a coach , i 've thought that he could , but he told me he 's not looking there , at least now , ' @entity1 said .			2
