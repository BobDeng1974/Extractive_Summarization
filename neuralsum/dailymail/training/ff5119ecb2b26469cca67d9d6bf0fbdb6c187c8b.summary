by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 19:32 est , 26 july 2012 if anyone knows a thing or two about making the vintage look work , it 's @entity5			1
the @entity6 star single - handedly sparked the early @entity8 bombshell trend when she first hit screens as @entity10 in 2007			1
and it seems the actress , 37 , has a penchant for decades past off - screen too , as she reveals in a new interview with @entity16 's @entity15 show the look			1
she offers a glimpse of her favourite pieces from her wardrobe , and takes the crew on a tour of her favourite @entity24 vintage stores			1
in a second store , a hat boutique , she was more enthusiastic still , trying on countless hats , before selecting a wide - brimmed number to take home			2
@entity41 essential : the actress models an embellished capelet , that she says goes with everything she issues words of wisdom in the process too , like : ' you 've got to lock down your fascinator , ' and ' the secret to wearing a hat is that you have to commit to it			1
you 've got to commit to these feathers			2
' @entity5 , who is married to fellow actor @entity56 , is certainly experienced enough to know			0
she reveals that she has been seeking out thrift store finds since the age of about ten			1
' i lived in @entity60 , @entity61 , and there were n't a lot of shops , ' she says			0
' i learned very early on to go to the @entity65 and just little vintage stores , and create my own looks			1
oftentimes tragic ... @entity69 's entertainment ! @entity5 had a ball in her favourite headwear store , trying on an array of designs titfer tat : the star looked fantastic in every piece , but chose a wide - brimmed number ( right ) as her favourite ' there were some very original looks that i put together			1
i had my goth phase , which was pretty ... dramatic			0
' another source of knowledge and inspiration , has of course , been @entity6			1
she credits the show 's costume designer , @entity88 , with steering her towards fitted silhouettes that flatter her curvy figure			1
' i 've learned a lot from being on @entity6 actually , as far as tailoring , silhouettes and things like that , ' she continues			1
' @entity88 , our costume designer , she 's taught me a lot			1
setting trends : @entity5 shot to fame as office bombshell @entity10 on @entity6 woven headpiece : ' this is one of my favourite hats ( above )			1
it 's straw , but it 's moulded			2
cool , right ? very gypsy			0
' the nice thing about this hat , cause it 's very formal , is that you could actually wear this to a dinner party and you do n't have to take it off because it 's part of the outfit			2
' embellished capelet : @entity5 says : ' this [ capelet , above ] is one thing that i find i wear often , and you would think that because it 's so sort of specific that you would n't			2
' it 's ... one of my absolute favourite things because you can wear it with jeans and a t - shirt or you could wear it with a dress			1
' it looks also very vintage as well , but it 's actually new			2
' ' i think i have a lot more pencil skirts			0
i used to like very sort of 1920s baggy , sort of floral lacy things that probably were n't the most flattering on me , but were just so gorgeous that i wore them anyway			0
' among the items that @entity5 insists every woman must own is a metallic coat ' for the evening '			0
picking up one such garment in vintage store @entity138 , she remarks : ' it 's incredibly subtle			2
' she admits having the money to spend on her wardrobe has certainly helped keep the fashion faux pas to a minimum			0
she worked as a model between the ages of 18 and 27 , living in @entity147 and @entity148 , and could not afford to splash out on fashion			0
' there were probably some really bad outfits then , because i did n't have any money to shop , ' she said			0
' i could only shop at @entity154 ! ' i 'd go back home where my family lives in @entity158 , there was great vintage stuff there because a lot of people did n't want the stuff that i wanted , so i 'd go and get that stuff and mix it in with a little @entity154 tank top or something			0
' one thing @entity5 does remember splashing out on was a pair of leather jeans			0
' i remember saving up when i lived in @entity148 , ' she recalled			0
' i wanted a pair of leather jeans so badly and there was some shop down on @entity174 's ... i think they were $ 200			2
' that was a really big purchase for me			0
i saved up and saved up , and i wore them every single day			0

the @entity6 actress also reveals favourite pieces from her own closet , and what she has learned from the show 's costume designer , @entity88
