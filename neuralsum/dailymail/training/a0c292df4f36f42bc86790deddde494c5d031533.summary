by @entity0 ten of thousands of birds flying over @entity2 are being scorched to death each year by powerful sun beams from the world 's largest solar plant			1
the birds have been dubbed ' streamers ' by workers at the plant in the @entity11 , for the smoke plume that comes from them as they ignite in midair			1
federal wildlife investigators visited the @entity18 plant last year and watched as birds burned and fell , reporting an average of one ' streamer ' every two minutes			2
estimates per year now range from a low of about a thousand by @entity18 to 28,000 by an expert for the @entity38 environmental group			0
the deaths are ' alarming			0
it 's hard to say whether that 's the location or the technology , ' said @entity43 , renewable - energy director for the @entity2 chapter of the @entity46			1
' there needs to be some caution			0
' the bird deaths mark the latest instance in which the quest for clean energy sometimes has inadvertent environmental harm			0
debate : plant officials dispute that all the streamers are caused by birds			2
pictured is @entity59 that was found at the @entity26 solar plant solar farms have been criticised for their impacts on desert tortoises , and wind farms have killed birds , including numerous raptors			1
' we take this issue very seriously , ' said @entity69 , a spokesman for @entity70 of @entity71 , @entity2 , the second of the three companies behind the plant			2
the third , @entity75 , deferred comment to its partners			0
wildlife officials who witnessed the phenomena say many of the clouds of smoke were too big to come from anything but a bird , and they add that they saw the ' birds entering the solar flux and igniting , consequently become a streamer			1
' the $ 2.2 billion ( £ 1.32 billion ) plant , which launched in february , is at @entity26 near the @entity2 - @entity89 border			1
the operator says it is the world 's biggest plant to employ so - called power towers			1
more than 300,000 mirrors , each the size of a garage door , reflect solar rays onto three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high			0
the water inside is heated to produce steam , which turns turbines that generate enough electricity for 140,000 homes			0
@entity106 rays sent up by the field of mirrors are bright enough to dazzle pilots flying in and out of @entity110 and @entity111			0
federal wildlife officials said @entity113 might act as a ' mega-trap ' for wildlife , with the bright light of the plant attracting insects , which in turn attract insect - eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused light rays			2
federal and state biologists call the number of deaths significant , based on sightings of birds getting singed and falling , and on retrieval of carcasses with feathers charred too severely for flight			2
@entity26 officials dispute the source of the so - called streamers , saying at least some of the puffs of smoke mark insects and bits of airborne trash being ignited by the solar rays			1
high tech , high mortality rate : more than 300,000 mirrors , each the size of a garage door , reflect solar rays onto three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high			0
when birds fly through the powerful reflected light , they 're scorched and leave a trail of smoke federal wildlife officials said @entity113 might act as a ' mega-trap ' for wildlife , with the bright light of the plant attracting insects , which in turn attract insect - eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused rays @entity166 @entity165 officials say they want a death toll for a full year of operation			1
given the apparent scale of bird deaths at @entity26 , authorities should thoroughly track bird kills there for a year , including during annual migratory seasons , before granting any more permits for that kind of solar technology , said mr @entity43 , of the @entity46			1
the toll on birds has been surprising , said @entity180 , chairman of the @entity181			0
' we did n't see a lot of impact ' on birds at the first , smaller power towers in the @entity166 and @entity187 , @entity180 said			0
the commission is now considering the application from @entity190 - based @entity18 to build a mirror field and a 75 - story power tower that would reach above the sand dunes and creek washes between @entity195 and the @entity2 - @entity197 border			1
the proposed plant is on a flight path for birds between the @entity201 and @entity2 's largest lake , the @entity203 — an area , experts say , is richer in avian life than the @entity26 plant , with protected golden eagles and peregrine falcons and more than 100 other species of birds recorded there			1
unsettling : authorities at the plant call the trails of smoke left by scorched birds ' streamers ' @entity220 officials warned @entity2 this month that the power - tower style of solar technology holds ' the highest lethality potential ' of the many solar projects burgeoning in the deserts of @entity2			1
the commission 's staff estimates the proposed new tower would be almost four times as dangerous to birds as the @entity26 plant			1
the agency is expected to decide this autumn on the proposal			0
while biologists say there is no known feasible way to curb the number of birds killed , the companies behind the projects say they are hoping to find one — studying whether lights , sounds or some other technology would scare them away , said @entity244 , senior vice president at @entity18			0
massive : the $ 2.2 billion plant part - owned by @entity75 is the world 's largest and company @entity18 wants to build one even bigger @entity18 also is offering $ 1.8 ( £ 1.08 ) million in compensation for anticipated bird deaths at @entity250 , @entity244 said			1
the company is proposing the money for programs such as those to spay and neuter domestic cats , which a government study found kill over 1.4 billion birds a year			2
opponents say that would do nothing to help the desert birds at the proposed site			2
power - tower proponents are fighting to keep the deaths from forcing a pause in the building of new plants when they see the technology on the verge of becoming more affordable and accessible , said @entity270 , a renewable - energy expert			0
when it comes to powering the country 's grids , ' diversity of technology ... is critical , ' mr @entity270 said			0
' nobody should be arguing let 's be all coal , all solar , ' all wind , or all nuclear			2
' and every one of those technologies has a long list of pros and cons. ' the @entity18 plant is located in the @entity11			0
it is currently the largest solar thermal power plant in the world even bigger : the @entity181 is now considering the application from @entity190 - based @entity18 to build a mirror field and a 75 - story power tower that would reach above the sand dunes and creek washes between @entity195 and the @entity2 - @entity197 border			1

experts claim @entity2 solar array is killing nearly 30,000 birds per year
solar plant is the world 's largest , but plans for a larger one are *underway*
proposed new 75 - story plant would be located near a huge bird *sanctuary*
authorities call the smoke trails left by scorched birds ' streamers '
