by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 08:19 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 22 january 2013 a deadly batch of super-strength ecstasy known as ‘ dr death ’ is suspected to be behind a spate of tragic deaths among young partygoers			1
five people have died in the last month – three last weekend just hours after they apparently took the drug			1
the first was 20 - year - old @entity13 , a promising student in the final year of an art degree			1
her body was found on december 22 in a flat in the picture - postcard town of @entity18 in @entity19			0
as her funeral was held there yesterday , tributes from friends were piling up on a @entity25 tribute page			1
warning : @entity13 , who died in @entity19 last month after apparently taking the drug			1
her uncle has issued a warning to young people to think before they use such pills @entity31 , 19 , from @entity32 , left , who died on sunday and @entity33 , 28 , right , who died on monday			1
it is thought they both took contaminated ecstasy tablets beside them was an emotional message from @entity40 ’s uncle , warning teenagers of the perils of taking illegal party drugs			1
dr @entity44 , often shaped like @entity46 sweets and also called @entity47 , has the chemical name @entity49			0
it is thought to be behind a wave of hospital admissions with nine people being rushed in for treatment in the last week			0
it is sold to clubbers for as little as £ 3 a pill and dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy ( @entity60 ) but it is around five times as strong and causes a dangerous rise in body temperature			0
the effects also take longer to act than ecstasy causing some users to take pill after pill , leading to fatal doses			0
earlier this month @entity49 was linked to the deaths of eight revellers in @entity71 and there have been other deaths in @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
the five suspected @entity79 victims – @entity40 and four men – all died within a 60 - mile radius in @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity19			1
@entity40 was a student at @entity86 in @entity87			0
on her @entity25 page , 40 - year - old @entity88 wrote : ‘ i ’m @entity40 ’s uncle and am absolutely devastated by my family ’s loss			1
our beautiful girl gone far too early			0
i am heartened by the fact that so many of you have commented but let this tragic sequence of events teach you a few things			0
@entity13 , 20 , from @entity102 and @entity103 , 18 , from @entity104 , both of whom died in december , sparking police to issue a warning of the perils of using pink ' ecstasy ' ‘ think long and hard about how you live your lives , about which group of people you hang about with and about who influences you			1
it ’s all very well writing a few “ nice ” things on a fb wall but if you carry on living your lives as so many of you are then – as much as it seems like a laugh at the moment – you are running the risk of your families being torn apart with grief like mine is			0
‘ so , by all means quote the poems and write the testimonials , but do n’t let our little girl ’s tragic death be in vain			1
some of you have the chance to be shining stars whilst still here , and believe me that is far better than being one in death			1
‘ so remember @entity40 with happiness , remember her vitality , carry on loving her as some of you did , and most of all learn from this as that is the best testament that you can give to my beautiful niece			1
’ the second victim was 18 - year - old @entity103 , who died in a flat in the neighbouring town of @entity104 on december 23			2
his father @entity159 , 40 , said : ‘ so many kids take these recreational drugs but they just do n’t know what ’s in them			0
they go out to parties , they see their friends taking them , so they have some too , and they do n’t realise they ’re playing @entity156 roulette			2
these pills are deadly , and whoever made them needs to be caught and locked up			0
’ mr @entity159 , who is separated from @entity103 ’s mother , @entity164 , said his son was ‘ just a really lovely , likeable lad ’ who hoped to follow him into the offshore oil and gas industry			0
in the wake of the deaths , police made 11 arrests in a series of raids in @entity19 and warned recreational users of the dangers of using @entity176			2
then last weekend three men died after taking similar drugs within the space of 24 hours			1
@entity33 , 28 , a plasterer from @entity32 , suffered an adverse reaction after he apparently took the drug and began sweating profusely			2
he went out into his girlfriend ’s freezing garden to cool down and collapsed from a massive heart attack			0
friends paid tribute to @entity31 , pictured , saying he was ' such a nice lad ' who will be ' truly missed ' paramedics were called and he was taken to hospital but suffered another heart attack and died later the same night			1
his girlfriend , @entity192 , 29 , revealed that their ten - day - old daughter , @entity193 , had died of a chest infection a year ago			2
she said : ‘ it was the one year anniversary since her death on january 16 and then four days later @entity33 had gone too			2
@entity197 was hard because it was without @entity193 and we should have had her there			0
but @entity33 was my rock and i would n’t have been able to get over her death without @entity33			2
this has come as a massive shock not least because he was n’t a drug abuser			2
i ’d tell other people just not to do drugs			0
it ruins the people who are left behind and we have to pick up the pieces			0
i want this to make people think twice and i hope this opens their eyes to other people ’s grief			0
’ @entity31 , 19 , also from @entity32 , became the second fatality of the weekend after taking the lethal drug			2
a 26 - year - old football fan from @entity222 , whose name has not been released , also died on sunday after collapsing at a guesthouse in @entity84 having taken the ecstasy style drug following a football match at @entity227			1
yesterday police in @entity83 confirmed that toxicology tests were taking place and that they are liaising with other forces			1
they have arrested two men , aged 33 and 34 , on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug			1
what the contaminated tablets could look like : @entity237 coloured ecstasy tablets in a heart shape which can be lethal			0

@entity13 ' uncle @entity241 urged her friends to ' learn ' from her death
police have not ruled out a link between her death and that of four others all believed to have taken super-strong drug and lived in a 60 mile radius
two men died in the @entity83 area on sunday and monday
