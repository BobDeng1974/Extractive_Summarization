@entity0 went from feeling lousy to happy after watching his @entity2 team return to winning ways against @entity4			1
substitute @entity5 scored his third goal of the season just four minutes after his introduction to hand @entity2 a 1 - 0 win at @entity10 on saturday			1
going into the match on the back of a three - match winless run , @entity11 had said he felt ' lousy ' , but his team are now just two points outside the top four			1
@entity0 was pleased with @entity2 's win , despite disappointing first half at @entity10 @entity5 strikes from the edge of the box with a shot that was deflected past @entity24 there was a slight hint of frustration about @entity11 's persona post-match			1
the @entity2 boss was unhappy his men did not score more goals against a solid and packed @entity4 defence			2
but his over-riding emotion was happiness			0
' i am happy with the three points , ' @entity11 said			1
' they came to defend and that is always very difficult to play as a team against			0
' we had a lot of time on the ball , we created possibilities , not big chances , but possibilities			0
' we could have scored in the first half but i said at half - time , " okay , we played better than the matches before because we kept the pace before and the opponents will tire and there will come a moment we will score "			0
@entity5 celebrates breaking the deadlock in front of a delighted @entity10 crowd after 67 minutes @entity57 had the best chance of the game but his lob over @entity61 was also over the crossbar ' it was @entity5 ( who did ) and after that goal i think we created more big chances because then they had to come forward , only we have to finish these chances because they were big chances			1
' but i said several times when we are ahead in a game we have to kill the game and we did			0
so i 'm happy , we have three points and we are two points behind fourth place so it is in our hands and that 's important			2
' @entity5 exchanged passes with @entity77 in the 67th minute before dispatching a curling low shot past @entity24 off the head of @entity80			2
@entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 all spurned chances to score and @entity85 also went close with a fine shot after a stunning run from his own half			0
@entity11 waves to the @entity10 crowd after doing ' what everyone in the stadium expected ' with a win @entity4 had perhaps the best chance of the match though			1
@entity57 was presented with a golden opportunity in the first when he went clean through after a mix - up between centre - halves @entity100 and @entity102 , but the former @entity2 striker put the ball over the bar			1
' just before half - time there was a misunderstanding between @entity102 and @entity100 and i could have been sitting here differently , ' @entity11 acknowledged			2
' but the team has done what everybody in the stadium expected today			0
' it was not as easy as everybody thinks			0
but we have won and that is good			0
