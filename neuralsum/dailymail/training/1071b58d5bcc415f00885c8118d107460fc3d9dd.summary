by @entity0 last updated at 12:16 pm on 5th august 2011 brainchild : @entity3 's aide @entity2 the death penalty , pulling out of @entity5 and withdrawing from the @entity6 topped the agenda as the public yesterday got the chance to decide what @entity10 debates			1
the government launched its ‘ e-petition ’ website with the promise to consider discussing any subject which attracts 100,000 signatures			2
passions ran so high that the site continually crashed as thousands sought to raise issues that politicians usually shy away from			1
other popular subjects included calls for the legalisation of cannabis and @entity27 to be kept on @entity28			2
but last night the subject attracting the most interest , with 6,000 names , was the death penalty – with calls for and against			1
forty of the 200 most subscribed petitions called for the return of capital punishment			2
seven of the top 200 , including the top one with 3,000 signatures , called for it not to be reinstated			0
the issue now looks certain to attract enough signatures for it to be debated in @entity10 for the first time since 1998 , and a vote could follow			1
among the most prominent pro-death penalty e-petitions is one calling for child killers and those who murder on - duty police officers to be executed			2
more than 1,000 people a minute visited the website yesterday			1
writing in the @entity54 yesterday , the @entity52 , sir @entity53 , warned that @entity55 can not ignore the popular groundswell			0
but critics warned that the e-petitions would allow the @entity59 to be hijacked by special interest campaigns and mean mps spending precious @entity63 time on proposals that have little or no chance of becoming law			0
popular petitions included calls for @entity69 to withdraw from the @entity70 and the @entity6 , an absolute right to self defence in your own home and the decriminalisation of drugs			2
others called for prisoners ’ diets be restricted to bread and water as in the ‘ good old days ’			0
fail : the highly - anticipated e-petition website crashed within hours of going live and there were several bizarre petitions including demands that bodybuilding be encouraged to improve the nation ’s health , and calls to make it a criminal offence to cruise along in the middle lane of motorways			1
no 10 ’s previous e-petition site was suspended ahead of the general election then shelved by the @entity98			0
but it has been resurrected by @entity101 ’s director of strategy , @entity2 , with the promise that those that attract more than 100,000 signatures will be considered for debate in @entity10			1
several @entity108 mps have said they will back calls to reintroduce the death sentence			1
the last hangings in @entity69 were in 1964			0
@entity108 mp @entity112 said the public was sick of seeing criminals freed from prison committing further crimes			0
sir @entity53 wrote in the @entity54 yesterday that the death penalty is likely to be discussed by @entity10 he said : ‘ we should recognise that with advances in technology and dna the chances of getting somebody wrong for a crime like murder is much more remote than it was in the past			1
‘ if at the very least this debate ends up with us going back to what we were promised at the time the death penalty was repealed – which was that murderers will spend the rest of their days in prison – then the debate will have served the country well			1
’ another @entity108 mp , @entity112 , said : ‘ it is about time we had a national debate in @entity10			1
the number of murders was about half in the 1950s			0
‘ the state makes the decision about drugs , it makes the decision about young men and women being sent to war and it talks about abortion			0
why are those so different that this particular issue ca n’t be talked about ? ’ but fellow @entity108 mp dr @entity152 said he would fight attempts to restore the death penalty			1
he said : ‘ the real clincher for me is that you can always get the wrong people and that is a terrible , terrible tragedy			2
’ @entity108 mp @entity158 said : ‘ too many politicians come from safe seats which means they only answer to other politicians			0
they have refused to discuss a lot of issues that matter to a lot of people			1
’ any petition signed by more than 100,000 @entity69 citizens goes to the cross-party commons backbench business committee , which will decide whether it is worthy of debate			0
this does not mean any parliamentary bills will be tabled as a result , simply that the matter will be discussed			0
a spokesman for @entity177 , which runs the e-petitions website , acknowledged that many users had experienced difficulties			2
‘ we apologise for any inconvenience			0
this is a result of greater - than - expected demand , ’ he said .			0
