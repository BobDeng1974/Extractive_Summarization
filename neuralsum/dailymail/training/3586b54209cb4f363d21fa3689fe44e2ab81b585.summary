few women would pass up the chance of being whisked away in a helicopter by 007 star @entity3 – even the @entity4 could not resist such an invitation			1
a great - grandmother and octogenarian , she is probably too mature now to be called a @entity8 girl			1
but when the secret agent from the movies called on the @entity11 to ask her to accompany him on a special mission , she had no hesitation in accepting			1
in the segment , prerecorded at @entity11 , the @entity4 receives the 007 star with the words : ‘ good evening , mr @entity8			1
’ they then leave and walk towards a helicopter , corgis in tow , and at one point @entity3 gives a nuanced glance in @entity4 ’s direction			1
it was the @entity4 ’s first film role , but it was revealed yesterday that she needed only one take			1
‘ she ’s a good actor , ’ said mr @entity33 last night			2
‘ she ’s very sharp			2
you did n’t have to tell her anything twice			2
’ not only that , he added , but she also ‘ got along with @entity8 very well ’			2
it was all the irrepressible mr @entity33 ’s idea			2
he raised it with @entity52 chief @entity51 , who thought it inspired			2
if @entity51 was a little doubtful , however , that it would be well received by the @entity4 ’s courtiers , he was quickly reassured			2
they listened sagely , laughed , and promised to ask the @entity57			2
the @entity58 has discovered that it was her deputy private secretary , @entity59 , a former adviser to @entity61 , who acted as the go - between			0
the @entity4 arrives in the @entity62 at the @entity63 alongside @entity65 president @entity64 ( left ) daredevil : @entity67 @entity17 , who stood in for the @entity4 , prepares his special ' wingsuit ' for a jump in may the @entity4 greets 007 at @entity11 with the words ' @entity70 , mr @entity8 ' in the film sequence leading up to her parachute ' jump ' some insiders refer to him as the ‘ secret agent ’ – because he was the key link between the @entity11 and mr @entity33 ’s team			1
lord @entity51 had served as chief of staff to @entity61 around the time mr @entity59 was working as the then @entity82 leader ’s communications chief			0
palace insiders felt it was a fortuitous connection that at least gave @entity51 a chance of winning approval for the plan			0
the idea appealed to mr @entity59 , 45 , who went to @entity89 and worked in managerial roles at @entity91 before becoming an adviser to shadow chancellor @entity93 and then mr @entity61			0
mr @entity59 , who is married , moved to @entity94 as communications director in 2001 before taking up his role at @entity11 in 2007			0
smooth operators : @entity8 actor @entity3 and the queen in the helicopter sources said her majesty ’s only stipulation for her acting role was that she would choose what to wear			1
eschewing the bikini favoured by some who have gone before her – most memorably @entity108 and @entity109 – she decided on a salmon dress			0
in the helicopter scene , she was played by @entity112 , famed for portraying @entity113			1
the scene concluded with the stunt double of the queen parachuting into the @entity63			0
seconds later the real @entity4 , wearing the same dress as she did in the filmed sequence , was met with roars of laughter and a standing ovation as she entered the arena together with prince @entity124			0
the @entity11 scenes were filmed in the quadrangle , the @entity125 , the @entity126 , the @entity127 and the @entity128 – and even starred her majesty ’s dogs , including 13 - year - old @entity133 , previously owned by the @entity134			1
the @entity4 was said to have ‘ immensely enjoyed ’ her acting experience			0
yesterday , reciprocating mr @entity33 ’s favourable comments about her acting skills , the @entity4 declared his show ‘ wonderful ’			0
and one @entity140 veteran said : ‘ it was a brilliant and daring move – all film performances can slip from being such a good idea at the time to then getting an appalling reception from viewers			1
‘ @entity4 played a blinder by acting and , like all great performers , also being herself			0
’ dramatic entrance : the helicopter hovered over the @entity63 , before the ' @entity4 ' jumped out , pulling the rip cord on a @entity152 parachute having made history as the first skydiver to safely land without using a parachute , daredevil @entity17 is used to high - profile @entity156 , after acting as the @entity4 ’s skydiving stunt - double during the @entity16 , the father of two says he has realised his dream			1
‘ i had the best seat in the house for a show that was seen around the world , ’ he says			0
@entity17 and @entity8 double @entity22 , 41 , underwent months of secret training for their show - stealing jump			1
on the night , @entity17 , 43 , was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the @entity4 was wearing , and the duo were driven to @entity172 , @entity173			1
their helicopter was given the all - clear to take off at 8.50pm by military air - traffic controllers and then guided into position over the arena at 800ft for the pair to make their entrance			0
after deploying their parachutes at 500ft , the duo steered away from the stadium and landed on a nearby bridge			0
@entity17 now says he has only one regret from the night : ‘ i really wanted to keep the dress , but i was n’t allowed			1
it would have looked great on a night out			0
’ in may , @entity17 completed the world ’s first skydive without a parachute			1
