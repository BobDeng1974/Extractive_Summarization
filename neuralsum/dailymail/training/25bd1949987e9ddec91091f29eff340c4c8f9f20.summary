by @entity0 if you want to unlock the mystery of how humans migrated from @entity4 , then the unsightly cold sore could provide the answer			1
the different genome variations in the cold sore virus have been hitchhiking their way around the world for tens of thousands of years			1
tracking these variations is part a project by the @entity13 who has been analysing 31 samples of herpes simplex virus type - 1			0
when the researchers compared the strains of @entity20 collected in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity4 and @entity23 , they were ' stunned ' by the results			1
the map shows how the cold sore virus originated in @entity4 and gradually spread outwards , evolving along the way			1
different variants ( labelled as ' i ' , ' @entity30 ' , ' v ' etc ) in the herpes virus have been hitchhiking their way around the world for tens of thousands of years and mirror the theory of how man populated the world the @entity37 theory is the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of modern humans			0
studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from @entity4 roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago , and then spread eastward toward @entity23 , and westward toward @entity22			1
these settlers replaced other early humans ( such as @entity48 ) , rather than interbreeding with them			0
their analysis showed the most genetic diversity was found in @entity4 strains of the virus , suggesting it had the oldest roots			1
the results give weight to the proposed by the ‘ @entity37 ’ theory of human migration			0
‘ the viral strains sort exactly as you would predict based on sequencing of human genomes , ’ said senior author @entity58 , a professor of medical microbiology and ophthalmology			2
‘ we found that all of the @entity4 isolates cluster together , all the virus from the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 clustered together , all the viruses in @entity22 and @entity21 , with one exception , clustered together			1
’ the researchers compared the strains of the herpes simplex virus ( pictured ) which were collected in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity4 and @entity23 geneticists explore how organisms are related by studying changes in the sequence of bases , or ‘ letters ’ on their genes			1
from knowledge of how quickly a particular genome changes , they can construct a ‘ family tree ’ that shows when particular variants had their last common ancestor			0
studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from @entity4 roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago , and then spread eastward toward @entity23 , and westward toward @entity22			1
the findings reflect the view that a small human population passed through a ‘ bottleneck ’ to get from @entity4 to the @entity97			2
from there , they went their separate ways to @entity22 and @entity23 , and eventually to the @entity101			2
nearly all of the samples from the @entity104 were linked to @entity22 strains , but one sample from @entity107 was linked to @entity23			1
@entity58 claims that the sample may have come from someone who picked up the virus during a trip to the @entity71			0
studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from @entity4 roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago another theory is that the person picked it up from someone with native american heritage whose ancestors passed over a ‘ land bridge ’ between @entity23 and @entity21			1
‘ we found support for the land bridge hypothesis , because the date of divergence from its most recent @entity23 ancestor was about 15,000 years ago , ’ professor @entity58 said			2
‘ the dates match , so we postulate that this was an @entity128 virus			0
’ the researchers said @entity20 strains are ideal for tracking long - term migration patterns because they 're easy to collect and capable of forming lifelong latent infections			0
because the viral genome is so much simpler than the human genome , it 's cheaper to sequence			2
‘ while preliminary , our data raise the possibility that @entity20 sequences could serve as a surrogate marker to analyse human migration and population structures , ’ the researchers said			0
the technology of simultaneously comparing the entire genomes of related viruses could also be useful in exploring why certain strains of a virus are so much more lethal than others			2
in a tiny percentage of cases , for example , @entity20 can cause a deadly brain infection , @entity58 notes			0
‘ we 'd like to understand why these few viruses are so dangerous , when the predominant course of herpes is so mild			0
‘ we believe that a difference in the gene sequence is determining the outcome , and we are interested in sorting this out , ’ he said .			0

most genetic diversity found in @entity4 strains of the cold sore virus
pattern matches movement of human genome that gradually spread outwards from the *continent* to @entity23 and @entity22
researchers hope the technique could also help explore why certain strains of a virus are so much more lethal than others
