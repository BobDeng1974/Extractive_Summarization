by @entity0 for @entity1 a new study into the benefits of @entity4 for patients suffering cystic fibrosis is being funded by the family of a woman who lost her life to the disease			1
@entity11 died in november 2007 of sepsis , after being admitted to hospital for what should have been routine treatment for her illness			1
the 24 - year - old was diagnosed with the genetic condition , which causes a build up of mucus in the lungs and digestive system , when she was just a year old			1
in a cruel twist of fate , her younger brother @entity23 , born three years later when @entity11 was four , was also diagnosed with @entity25 @entity11 , 24 , died in november 2007 after being admitted to hospital for treatment for her cystic fibrosis @entity11 was diagnosed with the hereditary disease , which causes a build - up of mucus in the lungs and digestive system , when she was a year old			1
her family are now raising money to fund a new research programme into the effects of @entity4 on the condition cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease caused by a faulty gene			1
the gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells in the body , and so causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus			2
sufferers struggle to breathe and digest food and require intensive therapy and treatments			0
six months after his sister 's death , mr @entity53 , from @entity54 in @entity55 , and his family established the @entity59 for @entity25 ( @entity60 )			1
the family 's aim was to help @entity25 patients and fund evidence - based complementary medicine for @entity25 sufferers , to help improve their quality of life			1
the trust has set up a patients ' assistance fund , directly paying for or buying equipment for patients , including treadmills , bikes , pulse oximeters , while others get acupuncture and @entity4			2
the 25 - year - old , neuroscience student , told @entity1 : ' we set up the trust to help other patients with cystic fibrosis			1
' he said they have raised nearly £ 200,000 since setting up the trust in 2008			0
and of that , nearly £ 40,000 has been raised to fund a new study into the effects of @entity4 on patients suffering @entity25 the study is being carried out by a team of researchers from @entity95 's @entity94 at the @entity96 in the capital			1
@entity11 's brother @entity23 , pictured , was also diagnosed with @entity25 when he was born			1
he and his family set up the @entity59 for @entity25 in 2008 , to raise money to help other sufferers in her memory so far the trust has raised nearly £ 200,000 since it was established			1
to fund the remainder of the study at the @entity96 in @entity95 in @entity4 and its effects on the condition , mr @entity53 said they need to raise a further £ 11,000 @entity11 pictured with her mother @entity109 , left , did not let her condition hold her back , studying a music and @entity113 degree at university and traveling through @entity115 for six months mr @entity53 said : ' you can sit down and take it or get up and move , was her ( @entity119 ) outlook			1
she convinced me to do the same			0
' cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease affecting the lungs , glands , pancreas and digestive tract			1
it is caused by a faulty gene			1
the gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your cells , so the lungs and digestive tract become clogged with mucus , making it hard to breathe and digest food			2
more than 2.5 million people in the @entity141 carry the faulty gene - around one in 25 of the population			1
there is no cure for the disease			0
but there are a number of different treatments available to help manage the condition , including physiotherapy , exercise , medication and nutrition			2
each week five babies are born with @entity25 and two people in the @entity141 die from the disease			2
more than half of sufferers will live past the age of 41 , and improved care treatments mean a baby born with @entity25 today is expected to live even longer			2
symptoms of @entity25 include a troublesome cough , repeated chest infections , prolonged diarrhoea and poor weight gain			2
mr @entity53 said : ' it is really exciting as it has never been done before			0
' it is something i do to help my cf and it helps my mental health and overall feeling of wellbeing			0
' it is excellent at maintaining health for @entity25 patients and improving mental health too			2
' the study is already underway and in total the @entity60 need to raise around £ 51,000			2
this weekend a group of friends are taking on the @entity181 to try and help mr @entity53 and his mother @entity109 , 56 , from @entity54 , raise the final £ 11,000 needed to complete the research			1
mr @entity53 said the trust is a ' fitting ' tribute to his big sister 's memory			0
he told @entity1 : ' the two of us became very close			0
' she was my big sister and was always making sure i did n't skip my medication			0
she proved to me that you could do anything , regardless of being a @entity25 sufferer			2
' she showed me it was possible to go to college and travel			0
@entity11 spent six months in @entity115 , she did what she wanted and proved it to me too			0
' of course it took a lot of effort and determination but she was always positive			0
mr @entity53 said @entity4 helps him to maintain his health as well as improving his mental health			0
he hopes the results of the study will help other sufferers ' as a @entity25 patient you always hear negative stories , horror stories , but @entity11 's story was an example of real achievement despite her illness			1
' @entity11 had so many friends , she never let @entity25 hold her back			1
if i ever whinged about it , i would get a swift slap around the head			0
' mr @entity53 added : ' @entity11 had a firm belief that laughing is a massive part of life and we all should live life laughing			0
' she managed to draw on this in all situations and it seemed to work			0
' i would often ask , " what 's the point if you live so short ? what 's the point if you 're going to die " ? ' she would reply , " it 's not about how long but how much you do "			0
' and she led by example , she volunteered as a helper for a charity in @entity242 , helping disabled children			0
' you can sit down and take it or get up and move , was her outlook			0
she convinced me to do the same			0
' visit the @entity59 website here , or the family 's @entity248 page to donate to their cause			1
the money raised for this weekend 's @entity181 will go directly to the @entity253 , who are working with the @entity59 , to enable them to continue their research into @entity4			1
