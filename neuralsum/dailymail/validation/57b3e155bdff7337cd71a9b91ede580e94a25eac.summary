@entity0 admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death the police chief on duty during the @entity8 disaster has admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death			1
but @entity0 denied his mindset was focused on hooliganism rather than safety at the inquest into the deaths of 96 @entity18 fans during the @entity20 semi-final in april 1989			1
the retired officer , 70 , has already made a series of admissions about ' mistakes ' he made , confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised ' unreservedly ' to fans ' families			1
he said he initially thought the problem was crowd disorder and only realised it was a ' medical emergency at 3.04pm ' - 12 minutes after the crush started on the terrace			0
but at that time transcripts of tape recordings made in the police control box where the match commander was stationed showed a subordinate officer calling for police dogs			1
@entity40 , representing families of the victims , said : ' you must have asked him to do this			0
it 's a medical emergency			0
can you explain that ? why on earth do you need dogs at the stadium ? ' mr @entity0 said he had ' no idea ' other than he wanted to create a ' secure area ' for the rescue operation			1
mr @entity53 asked : ' so dogs requested , ambulances yet to be requested			2
correct ? ' the witness replied : ' it would appear so			0
' at 3.06pm mr @entity0 called for operational support , a request for all available officers in the force area to go to the stadium			1
mr @entity53 asked : ' why more manpower ? ' , to which @entity0 replied : ' to help the rescue			2
' the @entity65 representing the families said responded : ' what rescue ? you have yet to call for ambulances or fire crews			0
' the inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend @entity8 was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back - up from dog - handlers			1
on the day of the disaster , police became overwhelmed by fans at the turnstiles as kick - off approached and mr @entity0 gave the order at 2.52pm to open gates to let them in			1
around 2,000 fans poured in through @entity85 , many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them			0
but mr @entity0 , as match commander , had not ordered this to be closed , which was a ' blunder of the first magnitude ' , the inquest jury heard			1
the tunnel led directly to the already - full central pens on the @entity96 terrace			0
some 96 @entity18 fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded @entity96 terrace around 2,000 fans poured in through @entity85 ( pictured ) , many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them , which had not been closed off by police ninety - six @entity18 fans died in the ensuing crush minutes later on the terraces of @entity107 's @entity8 ground as the @entity20 semi-final against @entity109 kicked off			1
mr @entity53 said police records did not record @entity111 declaring a major incident , which would have triggered a disaster rescue plan by emergency services			2
mr @entity0 insisted he had done so and there was an ' omission ' in the records			2
jurors were also told that an officer at the scene of the disaster made a call at 3.13pm for fire crews equipped with cutting gear to attend the scene			2
mr @entity53 pointed out to mr @entity0 that the request for fire service assistance came up to eight minutes after the semi-final was halted			2
mr @entity0 agreed that the eight minutes represented a ' serious amount of time ' lost in the effort to save lives but said he was making decisions in a ' very critical ' situation			0
during the closing minutes of his questioning of the retired officer , mr @entity53 asked him if he felt it necessary to be present on the pitch			0
mr @entity0 replied : ' not at all			0
the incident commander remains in the control room because if i am not in the control room i ca n't make decisions			0
' the inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend @entity8 was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back - up from dog - handlers accusing mr @entity0 of showing little , if any , organisation or control while in the control box , mr @entity53 asked the witness : ' your leadership and co-ordination and emergency response was woefully inadequate from start to finish ? ' mr @entity0 answered : ' i disagree , sir			1
' rejecting claims that he was involved in ' building ' @entity165 's case that drunken fans caused the disaster , the former policeman said : ' after the disaster i was marginalised and i took no part in anything like that at all			0
' mr @entity53 then asserted : ' your mistake ( in failing to foresee where fans would go or close the tunnel ) was the most terrifyingly bad mistake that fell woefully below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent match commander , was n't it ? ' mr @entity0 responded : ' sir , i have made my admissions , i take it no further			1
' mr @entity53 continued : ' it was gross negligence and ultimately it caused the disaster and the deaths of 96 @entity18 fans , did n't it ? ' mr @entity0 answered : ' no , sir			1
my view is it was an oversight , a mistake			0
' at an earlier hearing he told the jury he was a @entity194 at the time of the accident , but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent			0
he denied taking part in a ' cover - up ' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to @entity18 fans ' bad behaviour			1
the former officer also admitted he was ' possibly in denial ' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans , leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the @entity217 stadium			2
