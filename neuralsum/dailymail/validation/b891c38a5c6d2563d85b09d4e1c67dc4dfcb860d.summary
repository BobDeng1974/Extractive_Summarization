an eyesore bus station dubbed ' the mouth of hell ' was today dramatically razed to the ground by thousands of explosives			2
the dilapidated @entity6 bus station in @entity7 , a stark example of 1970s brutalist architecture , was reduced to rubble in just six seconds after more than 2,200 explosive charges ripped through the redundant building , tearing it to the ground			1
the dramatic collapse came after a five - minute warning siren which had sounded out across the four - acre site , warning the hundreds of locals who had gathered for the occasion that the demolition was about to take place			1
the historic event was also live - streamed online , after @entity47 pleaded with spectators not to watch it in person			1
