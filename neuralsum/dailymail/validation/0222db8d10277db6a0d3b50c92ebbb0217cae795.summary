@entity0 will unleash their ' special ' force of nature , @entity3 , against @entity4 at @entity5 on saturday to add clout and dynamism up front following the crushing loss to @entity9			1
@entity11 's 26 - year - old lock returns to the starting xv as one of two changes from the setback in @entity15 which dashed hopes of a @entity17 for yet another year			1
the other sees @entity19 full back @entity20 reinstated as @entity21 announced his line - up on wednesday for the latest installment of an increasingly one - sided @entity25 rivalry			1
@entity3 will make a welcome return for @entity0 against @entity4 at @entity5 on saturday backs : @entity28 ( @entity19 ) ; a @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity30 ) , @entity32 ( @entity11 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) ; @entity35 ( @entity30 ) , @entity36 ( @entity37 ) forwards : @entity39 ( @entity19 ) , @entity40 ( @entity11 ) , @entity41 ( @entity37 ) ; @entity42 ( @entity30 ) , @entity43 ( @entity11 ) ; @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , @entity48 ( @entity19 , c ) subs : @entity51 ( @entity37 ) , @entity52 ( @entity47 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , @entity55 ( @entity37 ) , @entity56 ( @entity11 ) , @entity57 ( @entity47 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) @entity3 will add clout and dynamism up front to @entity21 's side reeling from their loss to @entity9 head coach @entity21 said : ' there 's always a lot of competition for places and having experienced players like @entity3 , @entity73 and @entity74 available after playing well for their clubs in the last few weeks adds to our options			1
' it 's been an intense two weeks of training as everyone wants to be on that field on saturday and we 've had to make some tough selection calls			0
' @entity3 will win his 37th @entity84 cap against the @entity86 , having proved his fitness with the @entity88 after being out for two months with an ankle injury			1
two comeback club matches have been enough to convince the @entity0 management that he is primed to reignite their championship campaign			1
reuniting @entity3 with @entity95 in the second row means @entity97 of @entity47 is out of the match - day 23 , for the time being			1
having dipped against @entity9 after storming displays in the wins over @entity103 and @entity104 , the rookie has made way , with @entity37 's @entity106 , @entity107 , coming on to the bench along with flanker @entity109 - another back from injury - and prop @entity111			1
full back @entity20 will also be back when @entity112 announces his side on wednesday @entity20 takes part in full training at @entity116 on tuesday as @entity0 prepare for the @entity25 forwards coach @entity117 said : ' @entity3 is a special player			1
he 's been good for us			0
he 's really maturing as a player and as a person			0
you ca n't hide what he can bring for us physically			0
i 've watched his last two games for @entity11 and he 's played well			1
this time last year , on the summer tour and in the autumn series , he played exceptionally well and he 's back to his best			2
' we 've got a lot of athletes in the second row			2
i 've been very pleased with the progress of the guys who have been performing in the absence of @entity3 and @entity74 over the last few months			1
but we have a lot of riches in that area now			0
' for many years , @entity3 has been acclaimed for his destructive impact as a tackler and athletic ball - carrier but @entity117 insisted he is equally adept at doing the unglamorous duties required from a tight forward			2
@entity3 reunites with @entity95 while @entity107 ( pictured ) comes back onto the bench flanker @entity109 ( pictured ) also returns from injury , as will prop @entity111 ' he is capable of the ' grunt ' work , ' he said			1
' that area of his game has significantly improved , his work - rate			0
that 's what you get with @entity3 : high work - rate but also a lot of stand - out moments			2
' the reshuffle of the impressive lock stocks extends to a recall for @entity107 as a replacement after the first half of his season was disrupted by concussion			1
he has forged a reputation as a supreme lineout operator but @entity117 also paid tribute to his carrying efforts in recent seasons , and his leadership as an experienced figure who was a mainstay of the @entity171 ' success in @entity172 in 2013			0
forwards coach @entity117 describes @entity3 as ' a special player ' for what he brings physically @entity176 expects a high work - rate along with some stand - out moments from @entity3 on saturday @entity0 's defeat in @entity15 was notable as a rare off - day for captain @entity181 , who had been leading the side with increasing authority of late			1
@entity117 did n't duck the fact that the skipper needs to raise his game again			0
' i 've been happy with @entity181 this last six months , ' he said			0
' he did well in the autumn , against @entity190 too , injured his shoulder then came back to be outstanding against @entity103			2
he played well against @entity104 but , among a lot of other guys , did not have his best game in @entity9 against a very good outfit in terms of breakdown and set - piece			0
@entity181 had a rare off day against @entity9 but @entity117 expects the @entity0 skipper to bounce back ' we have had frank reviews and i 'm sure we will have a reaction from @entity181 this week			1
this group are very good at putting their hands up			0
one of his greatest qualities is his honesty			0
' @entity48 acknowledged the collective need to lift standards back up to where they were in @entity212			2
he will be hoping @entity103 scupper @entity213 @entity17 hopes before trying to deal with the expectation of a resounding home win against @entity4			2
' there are different pressures , ' he said			0
' we 're favourites going into that game at home			0
' you want to deliver and set the standard of how you want to play			0
hopefully we win , but hopefully we do it in the right manner			0

@entity3 returns for his 37th @entity0 cap against @entity4
the dynamic second row proved fitness in two @entity11 matches
@entity3 reunites with @entity95 , meaning @entity97 will miss out
@entity20 is also back for @entity21 after suffering concussion
@entity107 comes on to the bench along with flanker @entity109
