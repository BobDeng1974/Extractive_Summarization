from identical shirts to shaving razors , deodorant and even children 's chocolate , a new website has exposed that @entity7 women are paying more than men for the same everyday consumer goods			1
since campaigning group @entity10 launched @entity12 website last week , members and everyday consumers have identified nine separate products that have identical female versions which cost more			1
@entity18 has been identified as one of the main culprits , advertising a button - up shirt , that comes in both ' summer blue ' and ' blue denim ' colour options , on their @entity7 website for $ 59.95			0
@entity10 's new website , @entity12 , has exposed nine everyday items that cost more for women this is despite the products being identical in almost every way except whether they are targeted towards women or men however , the exact same shirt advertised under the men 's clothing section is advertised for only $ 49.95			1
other examples highlighted on the website , which show increases from as little as 11c or even 1c for items marketed towards females , highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further			2
while some might argue that they do n't mind paying an additional few cents now and again , @entity10 's senior campaigner , @entity45 , told @entity47 that the costs accumulate significantly over a number of years			2
' i do n't mind paying an extra 60 cents for whatever item it might be that i like , but when you think about it in terms of weekly and yearly costs , it 's hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than my partner would be paying - even if we had the same shopping list , ' ms @entity45 said			2
other examples highlighted on the website , which show price increases by as little as 11c or even 1c for items marketed towards females , highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further @entity67 chocolate eggs , for instance , which were advertised on @entity70 ' website for $ 2.20 , have a pink packaged ' girls ' version for $ 2.30			2
meanwhile a packet of five @entity76 disposable razors for women was photographed costing $ 4.50 at a supermarket while the men 's version , a packet of 10 disposables identical in everything but colour , cost $ 8.91			1
the reason for the 1c price difference per razor remains a mystery			0
when asked why companies would charge women more for the same items , ms @entity45 said there were two answers that @entity10 had considered			2
while some might argue that they do n't mind paying an additional few cents now and again , @entity10 's senior campaigner , @entity45 , told @entity47 that the costs accumulate significantly over the years a children 's mechanic set , sold by the same company , differs greatly in price			0
but is there really a difference ? ' one is the idea that men 's products are thought of as the standard product - the neutral or base product - but the women 's version is usually a " special " version or a side product			0
it all comes down to a theory being debated , that women are considered " the other " and different , and thus it being ok to charge a premium for the product even if it 's no different , ' she said			0
' the other reason is that they 're probably just able to get away with it			0
i 'm not privy to the conversations going on in these organisations , so i 'm not sure , but i dare say that if they can find a way to make a profit on women 's products by making them cost more , then they 'll probably continue doing it			1
' ms @entity45 said that @entity10 launched the website due to its interest in protesting against the gender pay gap , while drawing inspiration from similar campaigns being launched overseas			1
' we know that the gender pay gap is growing at the moment and that it 's only getting worse - right now it 's at 18.8 per cent , and there 's also a big superannuation gap so it 's been on our members ' minds for quite some time			0
we 've also been hearing more examples about the cultural pressures for women to buy more products , ' ms @entity45 said			0
ms @entity45 said that @entity10 launched the website due to its interest in protesting against the gender pay gap , while drawing inspiration from similar campaigns being launched overseas ' in @entity150 and the @entity151 in particular , campaigns have started around the " women 's tax " and we were curious to see if this was something @entity7 women were also experiencing , ' ms @entity45 said ' in @entity150 and the @entity151 in particular , campaigns have started around the " women 's tax " and we were curious to see if this was something @entity7 women were also experiencing			1
' the @entity12 website aims to engage @entity7 women in the global conversation that is taking place around the ' pink tax ' and encourage them to share their own experiences of the ' price gap ' while seeing whether it 's something they are interested in campaigning about			1
ms @entity45 warned that price differences were not always obvious due to items for different genders being held in different isles or floors , adding : ' it only becomes visible when you pay attention to it '			0
' we 've had a couple of submissions and we are starting to get a lot of attention drawn to the site , particularly in the last 48 hours , so we do expect the list to increase , ' she said			0
