they have some of the most provocative names around and , at first glance , may seem less than appetising when reaching for a snack or drink			1
but what seems like terrible brands to us could just actually be the true meanings of words getting lost in translation			1
from @entity14 's @entity13 biscuit rolls to @entity17 's @entity16 crips , @entity11 reveals some of the most unfortunately named foods in the world			1
@entity14 's @entity13 is a biscuit snack shaped like small tubes and filled with cream @entity23 biscuit snacks shaped like small tubes and filled with cream should not be labelled with such a laughable name			1
the @entity28 product , which is manufactured by the country 's biggest confectionery company @entity29 , is a favourite with students and children			1
@entity13 , which of course is sounds and looks like the name for the large intestine , was a deliberate choice of moniker for this particularly product			1
one ca n't help but wonder what the manufacturers were thinking when they came up with this gem			2
breast munchies are made from 100 % chicken breast nuggets and are enjoyed by @entity47 breast munchies produced by @entity47 brand @entity48 , the chicken nuggets , or breast munchies to give them their rightful name , are a popular oven - cooked meal in @entity53			2
made from 100 per cent chicken breast , the munchies are a good example of the @entity47 sense of humour , which does n't take anything too seriously			2
and we have to applaud them for that			2
@entity17 's @entity63 are similar in smell and taste to @entity65 @entity66 they look like @entity65 , they may smell like @entity65 and according to their fans , they even taste like @entity71 but they 're definitely not known as @entity71			2
instead , this cheesy snack from @entity17 has been given a rather rude name , which will no doubt bring tears of laughter to all corn - based snack connoisseurs			2
@entity78 yogurt is a product of @entity81 company @entity80 and is made from cow 's milk @entity84 yogurt @entity81 dairy company @entity80 's yogurt has one of the most unlikely names for a product of its nature			0
but rest assured that this treat is definitely not made from the milk of bats but instead comes from normal cows ' milk			0
the company received such bad press after launching the product that they decided to change the name to something less offensive			0
@entity104 hot drink urinal is made with cranberries and is said to offer ' natural protection ' urinal hot drink while in some places this is commonly used as a receptacle in male restrooms , for some people urinal is a hot drink			0
@entity104 's hot cranberry cordial drink is said to offer natural protection ( due to natural antioxidants in cranberries ) and ' contribute to fluid in the body			0
we can not however confirm if it is a diuretic			0
@entity123 's only puke crackers are actually known as only @entity124 only puke crackers with a name that makes you think of vomiting , this snack is not going to be the first choice for those looking for a savoury treat			1
the honey bean crackers are a product of @entity123 and are actually known as only @entity124			1
unfortunately due to bad product design , the last two letters in the word are invisible , saddling this treat with a name that could make you lose your appetite			1
@entity14 's @entity143 or @entity144 made with hazelnut paste and malt and covered in chocolate @entity143 the second @entity28 product appearance in the list , the provocative @entity143 or @entity148 is a confection made with hazelnut paste and malt , covered in crisped rice and chocolate			1
and while it may look like a downmarket version of a @entity157 , online reviews say that these nude balls are less tasty than the product that could have inspired from			0
at a @entity161 party ? dip your crudites in tzatziki , muhammara or cemen @entity166 surely no party is complete without some cemen dip ? the spicy garlic spread is found on chiller cabinets in @entity161 supermarkets and is a case of the true meaning of a word getting lost in translation			1
in @entity161 cemen is actually the word for a dip made from tomato paste			1
unfortunately it translates as something else in @entity182			0
slake your thirst with a @entity187 @entity186 beer @entity186 beer a pale lager produced in @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 is said to have a light hoppy flavour with hints of malt			0
according to beer reviewer @entity197 , the only negative about this beer is that it also has a mild metallic flavour			0
here are some more of our favourites : @entity206 's @entity205 chocolate accounts for 95 per cent of confectionery sales in the country			0
funny colas : the amusingly named @entity210 ( left ) is a product of @entity212 and is bottled in the capital city of @entity214			0
@entity215 ( right ) is the brainchild of the the @entity217 @entity219 pasta : typically filled with vegetables such as steamed carrots and green beans , this @entity221 product also contains ricotta cheese and onions @entity228 ice - lollies are made in in @entity229 avoid caffeine buzz with @entity232 coffee from the @entity233 @entity14 's @entity234 ( left ) and @entity237 's @entity236 juice ( right )			0

@entity28 enjoy @entity240 rolls and @entity241
no @entity161 party is complete without a tub of @entity245 or tomato dip
only @entity249 honey bean crackers from @entity123 may make you feel ill
