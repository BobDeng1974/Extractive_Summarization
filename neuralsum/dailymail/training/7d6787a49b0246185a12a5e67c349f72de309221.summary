by @entity1 reporter published : 08:31 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 17 november 2013 @entity2 's top one per cent are now paying almost 30 per cent of all income tax - despite only earning 10 per cent of all income			1
research shows the share paid by the highest earners , those who make £ 160,000 a year or more , jumped to almost a third from just 11 per cent when @entity9 came to power			1
it comes a month after government figures last confirmed the rise , crediting the coalition 's policies for lower and middle income earners			0
paying their share : how the share of tax paid by super-earners has risen ( source : @entity23 ) the rise since 1979 was revealed in research by the accountancy firm @entity27 for the @entity28			1
the top one per cent of earners in 1979 paid just 11 per cent of the nation 's income tax - despite the highest rate of income tax being set at 83 per cent			1
deputy prime minister @entity34 , pictured today on the @entity36 's @entity35 , wants to raise the income tax threshold further to £ 10,500 what they pay in proportion to everyone else has risen sharply since then , the paper reported , to a new high of 29.8 per cent this year			2
that is despite the super-earners , who number about 300,000 people , accounting for a far smaller 10 per cent of all @entity2 's income , according to the left - wing think tank @entity48			2
when it comes to their assets , however , the super-rich are far better off - with the richest 10 per cent owning 44 per cent of the nation 's wealth , or at least £ 437,000 each			2
the figures come after chancellor @entity57 argued those with ‘ broadest shoulders must take the biggest burden ’			1
low earners have seen their income tax bills cut , with the amount people can earn without getting taxed rising steadily to £ 10,000			0
deputy prime minister @entity34 wants to raise that further to £ 10,500			0
but the top one per cent of earners , who paid 20.8 per cent of all income tax just ten years ago , have seen the proportion they give to the taxman rise			1
it will be welcome news to the coalition , which faced attacks after lowering the top rate of tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent			0
@entity76 said it was a tax cut for the rich - but @entity78 insisted it would stop the super-wealthy moving their income out of the country altogether			0

i 'm not one of those people who complain that the rich are paying too much			0
' but i do think there needs to be much greater awareness of the fact that the same people politicians like to bash to win votes are contributing an awful lot to @entity2 's public services			0
