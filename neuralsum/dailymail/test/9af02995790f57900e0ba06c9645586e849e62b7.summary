a union conference heard today that schools are struggling to cope with an influx of children arriving unable to speak @entity9 - forcing some teachers to use @entity20 translate to make lesson plans in other languages they also said @entity9 - speaking children are not getting their ‘ fair share ’ of attention from teachers because of the additional needs of those from abroad			1
in a speech to delegates from the @entity31 , @entity33 teacher @entity32 said many staff had little or no training in how to deal with pupils with @entity9 as an additional language ( @entity38 )			1
she said : ‘ @entity13 schools are educating a rising number of @entity38 pupils			2
this continues day by day			0
‘ there are now 300 different languages and this is a challenge as we are experiencing growing numbers , and areas of previously no [ bilingual ] students now have them for the first time			0
’ she pointed out that it takes some pupils up to seven years to gain adequate language proficiency for academic work - which means their lack of @entity9 holds them back			1
teachers have warned that schools are now having to deal with pupils across the @entity13 speaking up to 300 different languages - but hardly any @entity9 she said that it was even harder to deal with those who had ‘ complex needs ’ such as communication disorders , autism and moderate learning difficulties if they also had poor @entity9 skills			1
around one in six primary school pupils do not have @entity9 as their first language , while in secondary schools the figure is one in seven			1
official statistics released in 2014 showed the proportion of non-native speakers in primary schools increased from 18.1 per cent to 18.7 per cent in a year			2
in secondary schools , the proportion increased from 13.6 to 14.3 per cent			2
some schools in multicultural areas have pupils with more than 20 different native languages			0
earlier this year , it was revealed that only 10 per cent of pupils at @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 , were native @entity9 speakers			2
@entity84 , who also teaches in @entity33 , told the conference in @entity86 she had @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 children in her class			2
she said : ‘ i was up until midnight writing individual lesson plans for the three @entity38 students and two other differentiated ones for the rest of the class			0
all the materials handled were self made and individual instructions using @entity1 were put into @entity88 and @entity90			0
‘ without the appropriate funding , the @entity38 students do not get the specialist support staff they need			0
‘ the non-eal students do not get a fair share of the teacher ’s time			1
the stress levels of the teacher go through the roof			0
’ @entity111 , a teacher from @entity112 , told the delegates : ‘ it ’s hard , not just for the teachers but for the children as well , and we need to be able to support them			2
' i ’ve learnt how to speak a little bit of @entity121 , a little bit of @entity123 , a little bit of @entity125 , and i ’m currently learning @entity126			0
’ @entity127 , from @entity128 , said pupils were arriving in schools with @entity9 which was ‘ rudimentary to say the least ’ and not developing their skills at home			1
statistics show non-native speakers in primary schools increased from 18.1 per cent to 18.7 per cent in 2014 he added : ‘ unless we do something to actively encourage parents to be a part and recognise that they are a part of this problem , it is still going to go on			0
‘ i know of schools where there are over 30 different languages being spoken			0
how do we expect to be able to cope with that unless we have support from everywhere ? ’ the teachers ’ concerns come amid a growing crisis over places in primary and secondary schools , fuelled partly by migration and a baby boom			1
in parts of @entity82 , almost half of families did not get their first choice of secondary school this year			0
@entity163 chief sir @entity162 warned last year that schools needed more help to deal with growing numbers of children who can not speak @entity9			1
he said : ‘ when they ’re faced with an influx of children from other countries , they need the resources and capacity to deal with it			0

schools are struggling to cope with children who can not speak @entity9
teachers are using @entity20 translate to plan lessons for migrant children
