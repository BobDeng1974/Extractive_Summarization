by @entity0 @entity2 and @entity3 's defense chiefs faced off over a territorial dispute about islands in the @entity6 , with defense secretary @entity7 wagging his finger at the @entity2 and telling them that they do n't have the right to unilaterally establish an air defense zone over the islands			1
and he said on tuesday that the @entity3 will protect @entity15 in a dispute with @entity2 , as laid out in @entity3 treaty obligations			1
@entity2 defense minister @entity18 said his country will not take the initiative to stir up troubles with @entity15 , but @entity22 is ready to use its military if needed to safeguard its territory			1
and he warned that the @entity3 must ‘ stay vigilant ’ against @entity15 's actions and ‘ not be permissive and supportive ’ of @entity26			2
@entity33 took a two - hour tour around @entity2 's sole aircraft carrier on monday , in an unprecedented opening by @entity22 to a potent symbol of its military power ceremony : @entity33 and @entity18 listen to the @entity2 national anthem during a welcome ceremony prior to their meeting @entity3 secretary of defense @entity7 , left , is welcomed by rear admiral @entity45 , director of foreign affairs office of the @entity32 and @entity3 ambassador to @entity2 , @entity48 , upon his arrival at @entity50 on monday the @entity3 has criticized @entity22 's recent declaration of an air defense zone over a large swath of the @entity6 , including disputed islands controlled by @entity15			1
in their remarks , the two men aired their countries ' well - known positions about the territorial disputes , although doing it for the first time in @entity2 , shoulder to shoulder after nearly two hours of meetings here			2
‘ every nation has a right to establish an air defense zone , but not a right to do it unilaterally with no collaboration , no consultation			1
that adds to tensions , misunderstandings , and could eventually add to , and eventually get to dangerous conflict , ’ said @entity33 , poking his figure toward the television cameras and photographers at the back of the room , as shutters clicked			0
greeting : @entity48 shakes @entity33 's hand at @entity50 just moments after he stepped off the plane high - ranking meeting : accompanied by @entity15 lt. gen. @entity85 , second from left , @entity3 secretary of defense @entity7 , left , walks on the tarmac of the @entity88 , @entity15 , prior to his departure for @entity50 , @entity2 on monday for his part , @entity18 said @entity2 stands ready to resolve the disputes diplomatically			1
but he made it clear that @entity2 is always ready to respond to threats			2
on the issue of territorial sovereignty , @entity18 said , ‘ we will make no compromise , no concession , no trading , not even a tiny ... violation is allowed			0
’ on a broader scale , the meeting focused on how the @entity3 and @entity2 can build stronger ties , in the wake of years of frosty relations over @entity22 's military buildup , persistent cyberattacks against @entity3 government agencies and private industry , and aggressive @entity2 territorial claims in the @entity6			1

in @entity2 they are known as the @entity124 and @entity15 calls them the @entity124 islands			1
they are significant because they lie near undersea oil and gas reserves , rich fishing waters and punctuate strategically important shipping lanes			1
@entity2 says they have been part of its territory since 1534 , but they were officially assimilated into @entity15 in 1895 after it surveyed them and established that they were uninhabited			1
in 1951 , under the terms of the @entity154 , @entity15 relinquished several territories , including @entity129 - but the @entity124 moved to @entity3 control			0
it was only a temporary arrangement , though , with @entity15 taking ownership once more in 1971			0
@entity2 , however , says that the @entity154 should have returned the islands to its territory			2
@entity15 hit back , saying that @entity2 did n't make any complaints at the time and that protests only began - from @entity129 , too - once oil reserves were discovered nearby in the early 1970s			1
it also disputes that the islands were ever part of @entity2 's official territory			2
the biggest island measures just 1.66 square miles - and the smallest is really just a big rock			0
@entity22 's recent declaration of an air defense zone over a large swath of the @entity6 , including disputed islands controlled by @entity15 has raised complaints from the @entity3 , deepening concerns that it could spark a confrontation			1
@entity177 has refused to recognize the zone or follow @entity2 's demands that its aircraft file flight plans with @entity22 's @entity181 and heed @entity2 instructions			2
@entity2 has warned of unspecified retaliatory measures against aircraft that do not comply , but has so far taken no action			0
he also said the @entity3 and @entity2 must be more open with each other about their cyber capabilities , saying that greater openness ‘ reduces the risk that misunderstanding and misperception could lead to miscalculation			0
’ @entity33 pointed to the ongoing threat from @entity195 , which recently threatened additional missile and nuclear tests			0
and he said the @entity3 and @entity2 have a shared interest ‘ in achieving a verifiable , irreversible denuclearization of the @entity200			0
’ in recent weeks the @entity201 has conducted a series of rocket and ballistic missile launches that are considered acts of protest against annual ongoing springtime military exercises by @entity208 and @entity177			0
@entity195 says the exercises are rehearsals for invasion			0
‘ our vision is a future where our militaries can work closely together on a range of challenges , such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions			0
however , to reach this objective , we must be candid about issues where we disagree , ’ @entity33 said			0
@entity33 also said the two countries have agreed to conduct a joint military medical exercise , although not date was set			0
the islands lie closer to @entity2 than @entity15 , but both countries have claimed them and he said they will set up new formal procedures that will allow their armies to better communicate and also set up an @entity233 between the assistant defense secretary for the @entity235 and @entity2 's director of the @entity237 so they also can more easily exchange views			1
the @entity3 ' campaign to encourage @entity2 to be more open about its military growth and intentions got a symbolic boost monday as @entity33 got a rare tour of the country 's first aircraft carrier , but efforts to get the @entity248 giant to be more transparent about cyberattacks and other defense operations has been less successful			2
in a speech planned for later tuesday , @entity33 will point to cybersecurity as an area where the @entity3 wants the @entity2 to be more transparent , said a senior @entity3 official , who was not authorized to talk publicly by name about the speech so spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity33 arrived in @entity22 after a stop in @entity15 , where he told reporters that @entity2 must be more open about its military buildup and better respect its neighbors - a pointed allusion to the territorial disputes			2
during unusually forceful remarks during his stop in @entity15 , @entity33 drew a direct line between @entity272 's annexation of @entity275 's @entity274 region and the ongoing territorial disputes between @entity2 , @entity15 and others over remote islands in the @entity6			1
calling @entity2 a great power , he added that ‘ with this power comes new and wider responsibilities as to how you use that power , how you employ that military power			0

defense secretary @entity7 wagged his finger at the @entity2
he said they have no right to an air defense zone over disputed islands
@entity15 and @entity2 both claim islands in @entity6 as theirs
they are uninhabited but stand over undersea oil reserves
