@entity0 is drawing up emergency plans for the collapse of the ‘ creaking ’ @entity3 amid warnings debt - stricken @entity6 will need a £ 500 billion bailout involving billions of pounds of @entity0 taxpayers ’ money			1
chancellor @entity10 said the @entity11 had ‘ stepped up ’ contingency planning and aimed to be ready for ‘ whatever the @entity3 throws at us ’			1
it emerged yesterday that the @entity15 , in which @entity0 is a major shareholder , could be forced to offer @entity6 a € 600 billion ( £ 514bn ) rescue package to give its unelected new prime minister @entity18 12 to 18 months ’ breathing room to implement big tax rises and spending cuts			1
chancellor @entity10 , left , has ‘ stepped up ’ contingency planning while unelected @entity6 prime minister @entity18 , right , could be given breathing room to implement big tax rises and spending cuts and in another move , @entity25 chancellor @entity24 and @entity27 president @entity26 were revealed to be plotting a new pact on economic union without consulting @entity0 or other countries outside of the @entity32			1
they are determined not to give @entity0 the chance of insisting on powers being handed back from @entity36 by negotiating a major new @entity32 treaty			1
@entity25 's original plan was to try to secure agreement among all 27 @entity32 countries for a limited change to the @entity42 by the end of 2012 , making it possible to impose much tighter budget controls over the 17 - member @entity3			1
countries will be forced to submit their budgets for @entity32 approval before they go to national parliaments , will have to sign up to strict new rules on the size of debts and deficits and will be sued for any breach in the @entity55			1
plot : @entity25 chancellor @entity24 , left , and @entity27 president @entity26 , right , are plotting a new pact on economic union without consulting @entity0 or other countries outside of the @entity32 the @entity60 - @entity25 plan will effectively mean an end to national sovereignty over budgets for countries remaining in the euro			1
@entity66 said it had become clear to mrs @entity24 and mr @entity26 in recent weeks that it appears impossible to get all 27 @entity32 countries on board for the plan			1
it could take years to secure the necessary changes , while a rapid loss of market faith in @entity6 , @entity73 and even @entity27 suggests urgent measures are required within weeks			1
@entity32 sources said @entity27 and @entity25 civil servants have been exploring other ways of achieving the goal , either via an agreement among just the @entity3 countries			2
alternatively , they could strike a separate agreement outside the @entity32 treaty that could involve a core of around just eight to ten @entity3 countries , officials say			2
the move will infuriate @entity0 eurosceptics , who have been urging @entity89 to insist on a repatriation of powers for the @entity0 from @entity36 in exchange for agreeing to let the @entity3 countries move towards fiscal and political union			2
in a sign of the deepening turmoil in the @entity3 , @entity15 officials were quoted by the @entity6 newspaper @entity97 as saying a bailout would be needed to give the country a window of 12 to 18 months to implement urgent budget cuts and growth - boosting reforms			1
the @entity15 would guarantee rates of 4.0 per cent or 5.0 perc ent on the loan -- far better than the borrowing costs on commercial debt markets , where the rate on two - year and five - year @entity6 government bonds has risen above 7.0 per cent			2
the size of the loan would make it difficult for the @entity15 to use its current resources so different options are being explored , including possible joint action with the @entity116 in which the @entity15 would act as guarantor			2
as a major shareholder in the @entity15 , billions of pounds of @entity0 cash would be put on the line under any deal , though it is not clear how much			2
@entity6 ’s vast £ 1.6 trillion national debt and its low growth rate have caused deepening alarm on the international markets in recent weeks , and even a @entity36 - inspired ‘ coup ’ which saw @entity127 removed and a government without a single elected politician in it installed failed to stop the rot			0
mr @entity10 confirmed yesterday that @entity0 is preparing for a break - up of the @entity3 that would have cataclysmic effects for the @entity0 economy			0
‘ well , of course countries like @entity25 and @entity27 have now openly asked the question whether countries like @entity140 can stay in the @entity141			0
it is a very , very difficult and dangerous situation , ’ the chancellor said			0
‘ it is having a hugely chilling effect on the @entity0 economy at the moment			0
we have contingency plans for all situations			0
we have obviously stepped up that contingency planning in recent months			1
you would expect us to do that as the @entity0 government			0
but that does n’t mean we are predicting any particular outcome			0
‘ we ’re just ready for whatever the world , whatever the @entity3 throws at us			0
@entity156 collapse of the @entity3 would have a massive impact on the @entity0			0
i mean , for example , one in seven pounds we export goes to @entity159 , @entity6 , @entity160 , @entity73 and @entity140 - just those countries			0
‘ so in other words , it ’s a very important part of our economic strategy that we get the @entity3 moving as well			0
