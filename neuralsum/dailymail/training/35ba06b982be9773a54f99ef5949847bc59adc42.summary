the agency declined repeated requests for comment			0
@entity10 's daughter @entity102 , 20 , who grew up with the tiger cubs sleeping in her bed until they became too big , says she thinks the big cats would be mistreated if taken away , ' and our family would go into a severe depression			1

you never know what 's going to set these animals off because they 're wild			0
' @entity13 takes a swim : one animal welfare campaigner says , ' people sometimes get lucky for a while , but sooner or later an accident is going to happen ... because they are wild ' pounce : campaigners say breeding in captivity does n't help conserve the tigers unless they 're bred in their native habitat and there is a plan to release them instead of promoting the animal 's welfare , @entity138 said the @entity168 have done the opposite			1
' breeding in captivity does n't help conserve the tigers unless they 're bred in their native habitat and there is a plan to release them , ' she said			2
' they ca n't get habituated to people			1
they 're condemning these tigers to a life of captivity			0
' the @entity10 family is n't hearing any of it			1
inside a high fenced - in area where the tigers now sleep , @entity10 roughhoused with the animals , playfully slapping one on the flank and then leapt atop him , holding onto the animal 's fur with both fists and grinning widely as the cat growled			1
' my father would die or kill himself if these tigers are taken away , ' @entity110 said			0
' they 're everything to us , they 're my brothers			0
we 've lived with them day and night for eight years			0

@entity10 saved @entity11 and @entity13 the tigers from a travelling circus in 2005
he keeps them in his garden in @entity17 , @entity4 , with a host of other pets
he has also used them to breed and now has seven other tigers too
while he has keeper 's licence , officials say he used them to breed illegally
he is fighting *action* to make him *sterilize* so they ca n't reproduce
