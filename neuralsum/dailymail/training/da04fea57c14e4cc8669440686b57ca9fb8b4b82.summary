by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 13:27 est , 24 january 2013 one - on - one lessons , no noisy distractions and the teacher 's undivided attention			1
it may sound like the sort of education many parents could only dream of for their children			0
but this is the reality for one little seven - year - old girl in @entity13 who is the only pupil in her entire school			2
@entity15 is one of a few students living in rural @entity13 who have ended up being taught completely alone in school after their thriving villages turned into ghost towns			1
lonely : @entity15 , aged eight , sits alone in a classroom at the school in @entity22 , south - east @entity23 one - on - one tuition : @entity25 is taught by sole remaining teacher at the school , @entity28 it comes as more and more villagers are abandoning their countryside homes in a desperate attempt to try and find work in the cities			1
@entity25 's school - located in @entity22 in the south - eastern @entity23 - is just one of many to have been left with no children to teach following the mass exodus			1
once it would have held taught dozens of pupils living in the small but thriving community			0
but as villagers deserted the area , the school was eventually forced to close in 2009 and 2010 because there were no registered students			2
it only reopened last year when @entity15 , then seven - years - old , was admitted			2
lively pupil : despite being the only child in the entire school , @entity25 does n't appear to mind too much count down : but four new pupils will be attending the school with @entity25 next year @entity25 was born with a missing spinal disc and needs extensive family care			1
because of this it was decided that the local school was her best choice as it 's very close to her home			0
now she attends the school every day to be taught by the sole remaining teacher @entity28			1
he follows the national curriculum - even playing basketball and jogging with @entity25 during @entity68 classes			1
once a week they hold a national flag raising day with @entity15 standing alone in the schoolyard to sing the national anthem			2
singled out : @entity25 is one of many pupils who have ended up being the only pupil in rural schools after villagers have left their homes to find work in cities nap time : the school was closed in 2009 and 2010 because there were no registered students until @entity15 joined last year warming up : @entity25 is taught the national curriculum - so her teacher @entity28 also teaches her @entity68 but @entity15 , who has been teaching for 35 years , said that while the one - student teaching looks easy , it is actually is very tiring and lonely			1
two player game : @entity28 challenges @entity25 to a game of basketball he said : ' when i am alone in the office , i do n't even have a person to chat with			1
' @entity15 's mother is a migrant worker in @entity97 city while her father and grandmother work in a local tea garden			2
' she is very considerate , ' said @entity15 's 76 - year - old grandma			2
' she often stops me from going out to work , saying i am too old and it 's dangerous for me to work outside			0
' but , in a sign that migration to the cities may be reversing , @entity25 can take heart that next year she will have some classmates as four new children will be starting at the school			1
but she is not alone in being the only pupil to an entire school			0
last week , the @entity114 covered the story of eight - year - old @entity116 who is the only pupil to attend his elementary school in , @entity23 , @entity13			1
his three - storey school building was built in 2005 and boasts 24 classrooms - all of which are empty apart from the one where @entity116 receives his lessons			2
two years ago the school had 80 students which dropped to 17 last year			0
but now there is just @entity116 , who sits alone at a solo desk in the middle of an empty room with a concrete floor			0
his teacher @entity132 said : ' although we have only one student , we teach him strictly with the plan made by the education bureau			0
' he is a good student and as teachers we also feel less pressure ' torn apart : @entity15 lives with her father and 76 - year - old grandmother in the village			0
her mother has moved to a city for work home time : @entity25 waves goodbye to her teacher @entity28 and a security guard running all the way home : @entity25 manages to keep herself entertained despite having no children her own age to play with he added : ' we try our best to let him feel the same as in other schools			1
as some day he may leave and join in another school			0
' mr @entity132 explained that the students had either quit school or had gone with their parents to the cities look for work			0
one of the last pupils to leave was @entity116 's 13 - year - old sister			0
@entity23 is a mountainous province in the south - east of @entity13			1
it has a population of around 35million			0
many people are forced to move away from the area where they were born to look for work in cities			0
single student : @entity116 is the only pupil at his school in @entity173 , @entity23 , where two teachers attend to his every need industrious : the eight - year - old was once one of 80 pupils at the institution but all the others have left wide world : many of @entity116 's fellow students have moved away when their parents went to look for work hopeful : his teachers say that @entity116 may eventually go to a normal school where there are other students			1

@entity15 is the only pupil at a school in @entity194 , south - east @entity23
she is taught by the sole remaining teacher @entity28
they follow the national curriculum - @entity25 is even learning to play basketball
many rural schools have been left half - empty after villagers were forced to leave their homes to find work in cities
