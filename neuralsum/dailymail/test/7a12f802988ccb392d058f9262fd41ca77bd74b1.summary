she said : ‘ getting my eyebrows back has done for me overnight what psychotherapy and anti depressants could not			0
‘ it has made me look more " normal " and feel more accepted because i do n’t look so different anymore			2
' i had forgotten what a difference eyebrows can make to a face and only wish i had access to this treatment years earlier			2
it could have saved years of anguish			1
‘ the incredible difference it has made to me is why i think eyebrows should be available on the @entity6 and i hope that i can help make a difference to other sufferers			1
’ miss @entity7 says she does not consider the treatment to be cosmetic , but reconstructive			1
she said : ‘ i was so young when i lost my eyebrows that i had n’t ever really drawn them on and if i did they were wonky and rubbish and made me look worse			1
‘ i remained very self conscious about it			0
’ the children ’s entertainer from @entity66 was 14 when she was diagnosed with alopecia universalis			1
she woke up one morning to find hair on her pillow and when she scratched her eyebrow it fell out			2

it was then when she started wearing a wig to school that the bullying started			0
she explained : ‘ i was nicknamed " cancer girl , " despite the fact i did not have cancer			0
' my wig would be torn off my head to be used as a football or flushed down the toilet			0
’ she endured six traumatic months before her teachers and parents agreed she should be home schooled			0
‘ the bullying was so bad that i had just shut down mentally , ' she said			0
' i was n’t learning anything at school at all anymore because the bullying dominated everything			0
’ she says she became very reclusive and rarely left the house for the next three years			1
‘ looking back i was likely suffering agoraphobia triggered by the alopecia - but it was n’t ever diagnosed			1
’ it was only when her parents were able to purchase more expensive natural looking wigs that she started to feel confident enough to face the world again			2
miss @entity7 had a £ 300 procedure to tattoo eyebrows on to her face ( she is pictured before , left , and after , right )			1
she said : ‘ it was like my face changed overnight			0
it had structure and definition again ' after securing a work placement at a local nursery , her confidence slowly grew and she one day admitted to the children that she wore a wig			0
she said : ‘ working with children was a great tonic for me because they are so accepting and did n’t care a jot that i was bald			0
' in fact they loved playing with my wigs			0
it did wonders for my confidence			0
’ in time , she started work as a children ’s entertainer and enjoyed being able to ‘ hide ’ behind the costumes which concealed her hair and face			2
then last year her mother - in - law to be then told her about eyebrow tattooing , but miss @entity7 could not afford the £ 300 procedure			1
she hoped it would be available on the @entity6 but when she learned it was n't , her future - mother - in law offered to treat her			1

it had structure and definition again			0

‘ i ca n’t explain how good that felt			0
‘ i ’m in a totally different place because of it and feel strongly that it should be available to all sufferers			0
‘ i was very fortunate to have family pay for it but others wo n’t be			0
and they may be costing the @entity6 more in therapy or pills to lift their mood			1
‘ i seriously think it needs to be addressed			0
