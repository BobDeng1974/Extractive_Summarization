@entity0 , a player so desperate to force his @entity1 move through that he was banished to train with the @entity3 reserves , got his wish on friday			1
the 28 - year - old became @entity1 's fourth signing of the summer - the second from @entity3 - and is designed to replace the departed @entity8			1
@entity0 does n't make the top 10 most expensive signings of the summer			2
he is n't even the most expensive left back , nor is he @entity1 's priciest purchase , yet there can be few as shrewd			2
@entity39 from last @entity41 season 26 - goals conceded in 32 games 131 - tackles made 49 - interceptions made 80.3 - per cent pass completion rate 1048 - passes completed out of 1305 @entity45 , @entity47 's new left back , cost almost twice as much as @entity0			1
that brought up questions : is an 18 - year - old worth £ 31.5m ? is @entity45 ready for that responsibility ? will he bow to the pressure of high expectations ? @entity45 , who turned 19 last week , has plenty to prove under @entity54			1
@entity0 , on the other hand , can be considered a safer bet by @entity22			2
the @entity24 's stock has risen over time , and that comes as a result of proving himself in @entity61			0
@entity0 made 32 appearances in a defence that conceded just 26 goals last year to guide @entity3 to their first @entity41 title in 18 years			1
he kept a pass completion rate of 80.3 per cent , made 131 tackles and intercepted 49 times			1
before all that , though , @entity0 joined @entity36 for a modest £ 1.7m			2
that time in @entity70 was what piqued @entity3 's interest who , in 2010 , paid £ 11.3m to bring him to the @entity74			2
there have been downsides , though			0
he failed to win the @entity78 last year , losing 4 - 1 in extra time to rivals real , and was overlooked by @entity81 for @entity27 's @entity83 squad			0
nevertheless , one of those remains a wrong @entity0 feels he can put right : ' i want to go one better in the @entity78 and , in terms of the @entity88 , i want the trophy badly			0
' @entity0 has allowed the @entity91 shirt - his regular at @entity3 - to remain vacant , too			1
that is in tribute to his predecessor , @entity8 , who joined @entity95 after an eight - year stint at @entity1			1
tourist : @entity0 and his family make a visit to his new home , @entity101 , after signing his three - year deal happy to be here : @entity0 tweeted his delight at joining the team he says he has watched a lot of @entity107 ( £ 32million from @entity3 ) @entity108 ( £ 30million from @entity109 ) @entity0 ( £ 16million from @entity3 ) @entity110 ( undisclosed from @entity111 ) instead , @entity0 takes the no 5 , last worn by @entity113 , and was keen to express the move to @entity115 as a ' dream come true '			1
‘ i ’m very happy and looking forward to getting started and giving my best for the team during the coming seasons , ' he said			0
' i 'm going to give my best in all the games			0
you are never going to see @entity0 walking on the field , always running			0
' i will give my best and give a lot of work and effort			0
i hope we can bring trophies to the fans and they are going to be very happy with everybody			0
' only time will tell if it is as shrewd a bit of business as it looks by @entity22 when @entity1 's season gets going against @entity137 on august 18 .			0

@entity0 signs for @entity1 after @entity3 accept £ 16million fee
@entity0 wears no 5 at @entity101 , last worn by @entity113 , as @entity1 leave no 3 vacant after @entity8 joined @entity95
@entity0 played 32 times as @entity3 won @entity41 last year - and made 131 tackles , conceded 26 goals and had pass completion rate of 80.3 per cent
@entity0 signs three - year deal and joins former @entity3 team - mates @entity149 and @entity107 at @entity1
