by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 17:43 est , 1 march 2014 neurologists have warned that @entity3 now seems unlikely to make a full recovery after spending nearly two months in a drug - induced coma			1
the 45 - year - old fell while skiing in @entity7 and hit the right side of his head on a rock , cracking his helmet			1
doctors operated to remove blood clots from his brain , but some were left because they were too deeply embedded			1
nearly two months after @entity3 suffered serious head injuries in a skiing accident some neurologists say the seven - time @entity22 champion seems unlikely to make a full recovery			1
the racer with his wife @entity25 the seven - time formula one world champion 's condition stabilised after he was placed in the coma			0
late last month , doctors began the process of withdrawing sedatives to try to wake him up			1
his agent , @entity34 , said in an email that ' @entity3 is still in the wake - up phase ' and that ' this phase can be long			1
' @entity3 's family has released few details of his condition to protect his privacy			2
' it does not bode well , ' said dr @entity44 , professor of neurosurgery at @entity46 who is not connected to @entity3 's care			2
' the fact that he has n't woken up implies that the injury has been extremely severe and that a full recovery is improbable			0
' his agent , @entity34 , said in an email today that ' @entity3 is still in the wake - up phase ' and that ' this phase can be long ' patients who have had major head injuries are sometimes put in a drug - induced coma to give the brain a chance to heal ; a coma reduces the need for blood flow and may help the swelling go down			1
@entity44 said doctors typically try every few days to bring someone out of a coma			0
' if you do n't start getting any positive signs , that becomes very worrisome , ' he said , adding that @entity3 's doctors are probably doing regular brain scans to look for signs of activity - though such signs may be difficult to detect if he is still being sedated			1
other experts said it was premature to make an accurate prognosis			0
' about 90 percent of the recovery is made within nine to 12 months , so this is still early days , ' said dr @entity80 , an emeritus chair in neurosurgery at @entity82			0
' the longer someone is in a coma , the worse their recovery tends to be			0
' his agent , @entity34 , said in an email today that ' @entity3 is still in the wake - up phase ' and that ' this phase can be long ' now that several weeks have passed since the accident , doctors may also have a better idea of how the rest of @entity3 's brain is doing			1
' mri scans can show any secondary deterioration in the brain structure , ' said dr. @entity99 , a neurosurgeon at the @entity100 in @entity101 and a trustee for @entity103 , a @entity105 brain injury charity			0
he said other parts of @entity3 's brain that were n't directly affected by the accident might now be starting to show worrying signs that may not have been visible before			2
@entity99 said that if @entity3 does eventually come out of the coma , he probably would face significant disabilities because of the length of time he has already spent comatose			0
while there have been rare instances of people emerging from comas months and years later with the ability to communicate , @entity99 was doubtful that would be the case with @entity3			0
he said the cases where comatose people made a surprising recovery had mostly suffered things like poisoning , strokes or failed resuscitation attempts			0
treatment : @entity3 is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the @entity128 ( above ) in @entity7			2
