by @entity0 @entity1 exists in a freeze - frame hybrid of @entity4 ’s @entity3 and the dissolute glamour of @entity8 — well , it does for me			1
this intensely romantic island contains the history of three millennia and glories in its extravagant culture and food , its vast ruins , glorious churches , showy bunches of basil and big gnarled lemons			1
as there are also golden beaches and brioscio ( that ’s ice cream served in a brioche ) , i ’m hoping that with three children in tow , aged 11 , nine and seven , this will be a family holiday that tames the tiny barbarians and invigorates their parents			1
superb @entity1 : an aerial view shows the @entity34 district and @entity35 , with @entity36 in background the leopard is set on the less touristy , wilder , west side of the island , where we are headed , arriving 90 minutes later up a bumpy track at our villa , @entity44			1
a single - storey farm building converted into an airy , high - ceilinged , three - bathroom house , it ’s spacious yet cosy			1
a pool sparkles at the end of a lush lawn			1
it is chlorine - free ( there are some baby frogs in it at one point ; the children want to keep one as a pet ) and around it there is an atmospheric hide - and - seek garden full of giant cobwebby cacti and prickly pears			2
it ’s quiet and isolated , overlooking vineyards , wild flower meadows and olive groves all the way across a tideless sea to the distant @entity70			1
the children could happily spend all week right here , playing something called ‘ @entity73 ’ in the pool , reading by the unlit stone fire on the huge sofas ( i imagine it could be blissful in winter , too , remote and snug ) and playing bridge ( their granny has got them addicted ) at the outside table in the shade where we eat			2
but i have other ideas			2
ten minutes away is the local town of @entity34 , a blowsy beauty , which looks part - spaghetti @entity88 set , part baroque fantasy			1
it ’s low built , with lots of decorative stonework , and seemingly more churches than people			2
fun for the whole family : @entity0 , with her son and two daughters here we have the first brioscio , a calorie bomb of sugary , bread deliciousness the size of a small child ’s head			1
from there , we get a cable car ( a hit with the children ) up the mountainside to @entity112 , from where you can see across the salt pans out to the glittery sea			1
we potter up and down hot cobbled streets , past snoozing dogs , to its finest pastry shop , the @entity121			2
it was set up by an orphan , raised by nuns , who taught the 500 - year - old convent the art of pastry making			2
we sit in the shaded garden , among pots of geraniums , eating almond biscuits in paper cups and ice - cool lemon granita			2
crystalline waters : @entity35 beach is a must visit on the north west side of the island extra treats arrive for the children and the ‘ piccolo ’ , as the smallest child becomes known , is growing accustomed to a cheek pinch from sentimental waiters			1
as a rule , @entity144 do n’t speak @entity146 , but their warmth is palpable			2
of course we must go to a beach , and @entity35 on the north - west tip is a perfect golden arc of sand with a mountain at one end and transparent turquoise sea to swim in			1
its backdrop is a laidback , sand - swept town with a strong @entity161 @entity160 influence			2
the church was an @entity164 fortress , though today there are monks praying in white robes			2
the food at @entity169 , serves the local speciality — fish couscous , which comes with a spicy red sauce			2
we find it very hard to leave @entity35 : my son is building ‘ @entity179 ’ in the sand , while the eldest reads and the youngest is pretending to be a dog digging for a bone			1
@entity1 has some of the most beautiful @entity181 ruins in the world			1
the site of @entity184 , less than half an hour from our house , was originally an @entity187 city ( the people who inhabited @entity1 before anyone else arrived ) , and contains a near - perfect @entity191 temple on top of a hill covered with poppies and yellow daisies			1
picturesque : the salt flats between @entity34 and @entity198 are punctuated by two old windmills up the hill are the remains of the old city and its jewel , an amphitheatre with a panoramic view from the top of @entity207			1
it looks deceptively small ; its smooth marble seats , now occupied by a few weeds and the odd lizard , once sat 4,000 in an intimate semi-circle			0
the children ca n’t resist hopping around on stage ; the acoustics are still powerful			0
‘ friends , @entity218 , countrymen			0
what ’s a few centuries out when you get this far back			0
the next day we are at @entity184 ’s mortal rival of a city , @entity225 , on the coast			1
here there is a well - preserved network of temples			0
one lies just as it has fallen ; huge pillars scattered in blocks like immense @entity233			0
once it was a gleaming stone colony with thousands of inhabitants ; you can sense still how prosperous it must have been			0
at dusk , it is almost empty , and a wonderful place for the children to play make - believe			0
on day four , there is a revolt			0
though they have ‘ loved it all ’ the barbarians , annoyingly backed up by my husband , think i have over-played the culture card			0
they try to hide my list and declare a ‘ villa day ’			0
they will be padding around the cool stone floors and reading in the sun or on the admittedly very comfortable four poster in the girls ’ bedroom			0
the youngest has just discarded armbands so is desperate to practise her widths in the shallow end			0
after a short walk to the local shop , we have a picnic lunch , made in the well - stocked , open - plan kitchen ; creamy cheeses , mortadella , tomato salad			0
that night a chef ( booked through @entity271 ) comes to cook us supper , and the children , amazingly , eat tuna carpaccio , swordfish , and less amazingly , cannoli , the local speciality of ricotta in sweet fried dough			0
cobbled streets : @entity0 and her family enjoyed pottering around the mountaintop town of @entity112 enough lounging around			1
the next day i ’ve seen off the mutiny and we are out again , at the salt pans on the flat plains leading to the sea ; those strange , pale expanses of water and salt , punctuated by old windmills that separate the two			0
piles of salt lie in small mountains by the road , with tiles on top to keep them dry			0
we take a short boat trip from the pans to the ancient island of @entity302 , one of four islands in the @entity305 off the west coast			1
here lie the remains of another lost civilisation : a @entity311 city from the 8th century @entity312 , centuries before the @entity307 arrived			0
a @entity315 - @entity314 heir to the @entity198 wine fortune excavated the island and turned his villa into an archaeological museum			1
there are pots and lamps and tiny gold jewellery , while its treasure , ‘ the youth of @entity302 ’ , a sophisticated @entity181 marble statue of a young boy has just been returned from the @entity329			0
@entity302 is hot , historic and incredibly pretty			0
like the rest of the family , i fell totally in love with it — and with @entity1 and its vigorous , grubby elegance , and barely felt we ’d taken the first layer off the brioche			1
@entity339 ’s @entity44 ( 020 7377 8518 , thethinkingtraveller.com / thinksicily ) costs from £ 2,100 a week and sleeps up to five			0
@entity342 ( flyairone.com ) flies direct from @entity343 to @entity344 from april to the end of october , from £ 62 return .			0

with its beaches , romance and history , @entity1 makes an ideal family holiday
the @entity353 on the wild west side of the island is a quiet getaway
@entity0 visits @entity34 , @entity112 , @entity35 beach and @entity225
