sir @entity0 said @entity1 had a 50 per cent chance of leaving the @entity3 , adding the country ' could not absorb ' so many migrants in the future @entity1 is likely to leave the @entity3 unless it allows us to restrict immigration , sir @entity0 warned last night			1
in an extraordinary intervention , the former prime minister said ‘ our small island can not absorb ’ the huge numbers moving here each year			1
sir @entity0 , who declared as premier that he wanted @entity1 at the heart of the @entity3 , claimed our chances of leaving the union were ‘ just under 50 per cent ’ – and warned this would increase unless @entity21 reforms rules on freedom of movement			1
he said that although the country welcomed hard - working migrants , the ‘ sheer scale of the influx ’ had put ‘ strains on our health , welfare , housing and education services ’			1
@entity1 had accepted ‘ one of , if not the largest population movement in peacetime @entity36 history ’ , he told an audience in @entity38 , adding that failure to tackle the trend would cause ‘ huge public disquiet ’			2
‘ it is a matter of numbers , ’ he said			2
‘ whereas some @entity36 populations are falling , the @entity1 has grown by 7 per cent in a decade			2
’ more than a million people have entered @entity1 from @entity46 and seven other former eastern bloc countries since 2004 , when temporary restrictions on migrants from those nations were dropped by @entity51			2
officials had predicted that just 13,000 would arrive each year			0
sir @entity0 , the last @entity53 leader to win a @entity55 majority , stressed that he grew up among immigrants in south @entity57 who were friends and neighbours			1
‘ i hate having to make this argument			0
i do n’t wish to close our doors to strangers , especially strangers with skills from countries that are often allies			0
‘ but i do recognise , reluctantly , that our small island simply can not absorb the present and projected numbers at the current speed			0
it is not physically or politically possible without huge public disquiet			0
’ sir @entity0 also launched a strong attack on @entity74 , saying : ‘ i hope we are going to push them back to the fringes of politics from which they should never have emerged			1
’ the @entity53 grandee – whose remarks were shown to and discussed with @entity81 in advance – sketched out @entity84 ’s plan to negotiate looser ties with @entity21			2
sir @entity0 said the country had received one of the largest population movements in peacetime @entity36 history , with droves more expected			1
migrants try to board lorries bound for @entity1 in @entity93 ( pictured ) @entity36 migrants should only be entitled to child benefit equal to the rate paid by the country where their child lives , @entity94 has said			2
the move would result in @entity46 parents in @entity1 with children who live in @entity46 receiving £ 18 per month , rather than the @entity1 rate of £ 80			2
the call for change – ahead of wider government proposals to limit migrants ’ benefits – follows a ruling by @entity36 judges to restrict benefits tourism			0
mr @entity94 said on @entity113 that we should go further to address the ‘ absurd ’ practice of paying child benefit to @entity36 who live here but whose children are still abroad			0
the deputy prime minister has told officials to look into a ‘ fairer ’ policy – although he conceded legal obstacles could be ‘ difficult to straighten out ’			1
mr @entity84 has promised to then hold an in - out referendum by 2017 if the @entity124 are still in power after the general election			1
sir @entity0 told a foreign affairs think - tank in @entity128 that a ‘ great nation may be poised to leave the @entity3 ’ unless it is offered an opt - out from ‘ ever - closer union ’ , reforms to free movement rights and legal guarantees that @entity21 can only act where individual member states can not			1
in what seems to be intended as a wake - up call to other @entity3 leaders , he said : ‘ opposition has reached a critical mass and now , for the first time , there is a serious possibility that our electorate could vote to leave the @entity3			0
' i put the chance of exit at just under 50 per cent			0
but if the negotiations go badly , that percentage will rise			0
' conversely , with genuine reform , it will fall			0
i ask our @entity36 partners to realise we are close to a breach that is in no - one ’s interest			0
’ sir @entity0 , who fought bitter battles with eurosceptics when in @entity81 , appeared to rebuke mr @entity84 after he erupted over the @entity3 budget at the last @entity21 summit , suggesting it was time to ‘ tone down the oratory and turn up the diplomacy ’			1
however , he insisted that as large net contributors to the @entity3 ’s budget for 40 years , @entity1 expected the ‘ national dilemma ’ of seeking to control free movement ‘ to be treated with consideration ’			2
labour leader @entity170 said sir @entity0 's speech ' is a pretty damning indictment of @entity84 ' ‘ it is not too fanciful to say that our partners must weigh up a choice : help us on this issue , or deny us – knowing that the latter course can only fuel the @entity158 argument			1
’ sir @entity0 stressed that migration across borders was not just a problem for the @entity1 , arguing the ‘ sheer volume of migration across @entity36 is alienating citizens from their governments ’ in countries such as @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			1
‘ it is powering the rise of single - issue political parties whose convictions are alien to a liberal and civilised society			0
' some are racist : others are border - line racist			0
some are merely bigots , ’ he added			0
sir @entity0 went on to criticise @entity74 , claiming the party is ‘ anti-everything ’			1
he continued : ‘ they are anti-foreigner , they are anti-europe , they ’re anti-establishment , they ’re anti-politics – i have n’t found out what they are for , but by goodness we know what they are against			0
' a thoroughly negative body like that is not the place into which you should put your faith or your trust , and certainly not your vote			1
’ national insurance numbers ( @entity221 ) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the @entity3 , up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed labour leader @entity170 warned that leaving the @entity3 would be a ‘ disaster ’ , but claimed mr @entity84 was unwilling to take on his party ’s @entity158			2
‘ the @entity53 party is increasingly a party drifting towards exit from the @entity3 – that is where the centre of gravity of the @entity53 party is , ’ he said			0
mr @entity170 added that sir @entity0 ’s speech was a ‘ damning indictment ’ of the prime minister , who was ‘ burning bridges and not helping @entity1 in @entity36 ’ .			1

sir @entity0 said ' sheer scale of the influx ' strained @entity1 's *resources*
former prime minister described immigration as ' a matter of numbers '
criticised ' anti-everything ' @entity74 as a ' thoroughly negative body '
@entity84 promises an in - out referendum by 2017 if *re-elected*
