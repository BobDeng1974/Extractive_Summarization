@entity0 and her husband @entity1 have threatened to a lawsuit against @entity3 after it fined them $ 3,500 for posting a negative review a @entity8 couple has allegedly been threatened with a $ 3,500 charge or credit blacklisting by a company who they wrote a bad review about online			1
@entity0 claims her husband ordered ' trinkets ' from @entity3 in 2009 , but @entity18 cancelled the transaction when the goods were n't delivered within 30 days			1
@entity0 told @entity21 she tried unsuccessfully to contact the company before venting online			2
the young mom wrote a negative review on @entity25 , slamming the online retailer 's ' incompetent customer service ' and ' refusal to ship products to @entity30 , @entity8			2
' but that was n't the end of it , according to an investigation by @entity21			0
three years later , @entity0 's husband got an email from @entity3 demanding the post be removed or the couple would be fined			1
the company claimed @entity0 had violated a ' non-disparagement clause ' buried in the sale terms and conditions			1
' in an effort to ensure fair and honest public feedback , and to prevent the publishing of libelous content in any form , your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits you from taking any action that negatively impacts @entity53 , its reputation , products , services , management or employees , ' the clause stated			0
disappointed : @entity0 's husband ordered trinkets like those pictured from @entity3 in 2009 which never arrived the clause also said if a consumer violates the contract , they will have 72 hours to remove the post or face a $ 3500 fine			1
if that fine is not paid , the delinquency will be reported to consumer credit reporting agencies			0
' this is fraud , ' @entity0 said			2
' they 're blackmailing us for telling the truth			0
' @entity3 appears to have removed the clause from its terms of sale within the last couple months			1
it appeared on the website as recently as august 2013			0
@entity0 contacted @entity25 to remove the post , which would allegedly cost $ 2,000			1
when she did n't pay @entity3 the ' fine ' within 30 days , the company contacted credit bureaus , which dinged her credit score			2
she said the family has been rejected by numerous lenders			0
' i have the right to tell somebody else these guys ripped me off , ' @entity0 said			0
this is @entity0 's critical post on ripoffreport.com for which she was fined $ 3,500 @entity21 said the company defended its policy , saying the clause was a ' term of sale '			1
the company also said requiring @entity0 to remove the post or face a fine was a ' diligent effort to help them avoid [ the fine ] '			1
@entity0 is not the first person to complain about the retailer , with dozens of similar criticisms on @entity25			2
moreover , the @entity106 slapped the company with an ' f rating ' in 2010 for ' not delivering products purchased online in a timely manner '			0
@entity3 today has a ' b rating '			0
@entity0 claims she and her husband have been rejected by several lenders because @entity114 reported her ' delinquency ' to credit companies @entity0 ( pictured with son ) said the family had applications for a credit card and a car loan rejected @entity124 attorney , @entity123 a judge would likely consider a non-disparagement clause unconstitutional			1
' i think this is outrageous that a company like this would force a consumer to relinquish their first amendment rights to speak about their product as a condition of sale , ' @entity123 told @entity21			0
' i have a serious question about whether a court would enforce that kind of covenant because it 's massively over broad and against public policy			0
