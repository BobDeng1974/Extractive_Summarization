when the first @entity1 launched on 3 april 2010 , opinion was split on how popular the product would turn out to be , and whether the tablet market would grow			1
now five years - and 225 million sales - later it might be natural to presume that those who doubted the device have been proved wrong			1
but amid falling sales and a new generation of alternative devices , some industry experts have predicted that the @entity1 ’s days are numbered			1
five years and 225 million units later , it seems many critics have been proved wrong - for now when @entity15 revealed the original @entity1 in @entity23 in early 2010 , it was met with derision by many technology experts , who failed to see how such a product would prove popular			1
at the time , blogger @entity27 from @entity28 said : ' is it a must - have ? the quick and dirty answer is : for many people , right now , no. ' unlike the @entity33 , which filled an already well - established need , there is no existing need the @entity1 fills			2
' @entity35 at @entity36 agreed			0
he said : ' i ca n’t see anybody who needs a laptop buying an @entity1 , and i ca n’t see people using it as a smartphone either			2
' but opinion soon swung back in @entity45 ’s favour			0
within the first 24 hours of @entity45 's launch the company sold 300,000 units , and to date , nine incarnations of the @entity1 have gone on sale , with the @entity51 2 and @entity52 being the most recent			1
1st generation : 3 april 2010 2 * : 11 march 2011 3rd generation : 16 march 2012 4th generation : 2 november 2012 mini 1st generation : 2 november 2012 air : 1 november 2013 mini 2 : 12 november 2013 @entity51 2 : 22 october 2014 @entity52 3 : 22 october 2014 * note : the @entity1 2 was the only @entity1 that had a number after its name ( aside from the @entity51 and @entity52 )			1
the @entity1 was soon heralded as being the perfect mid-way device between a phone and a laptop			0
considering , at the time in 2010 , smartphones were still by and large finding their feet , the @entity1 filled a gap in the market that many thought simply was n’t there			1
the @entity70 , a technology blog for ecommerce site @entity73 , cited a number of areas that the @entity1 exceeded in			0
in education , the @entity1 found its place as tablets were preferred to textbooks			0
and , according to @entity85 , it ‘ altered ( and possibly saved ) the publishing industry , forcing magazines and newspapers to create tablet - ready versions for digitally savvy customers			0
’ while the @entity1 was by no means the first tablet on the market , it successfully grew the industry to such levels that , today , news readers or presenters are often seen clutching an @entity1 when talking on the tv , where once they would have used paper			2
launches of @entity45 products are often greeted by swathes of adoring fans - and that was none more obvious than with the launch of the original @entity1			1
pictured is @entity101 picking up the inaugural @entity1 on 3 april 2010 in @entity102 , @entity23 how far we 've come : on the left is the original @entity1 , launched in 2010 , and on the right the @entity1 2 , launched on 22 october 2014 the latest variant of the @entity1 , the @entity1 2 , is shown here being unveiled by ceo @entity107 on 16 october 2014			1
in total nine different versions of the @entity1 have made it to market queues of people are seen here waiting outside the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115 after the release of the @entity1 2 on 25 march 2011 but it seems the tide may be turning for the @entity1			2
according to @entity119 , sales for the @entity1 dropped 18 per cent in the final quarter of 2014 alone			1
and this year , it ’s predicted that sales will fall by five per cent from last year - admittedly still at 60.1 million units - but the lowest level since 2012			2
industry expert @entity124 , from @entity125 , @entity126 , says that while tablets might have revolutionised some markets , it risks being lost in a sea of other products			0
‘ this year alone , shoppers are set to spend £ 6.32 billion [ $ 9.37 billion ] using tablet devices in the @entity133 , up from £ 3.62 billion [ $ 5.36 billion ] 2014 , ’ he said			0
but he added : ‘ we are seeing a strong shift from tablets to smartphones as the lines blur between smartphones , phablets , and tablets			0
’ @entity45 's @entity1 has widely been heralded as kickstarting the tablet industry , creating a huge new market between smartphones and laptops - and seeing many copycat devices made in the process ‘ there are still flashes of life in the @entity1 , ’ @entity148 , @entity149 , told @entity150			1
‘ it ’s still the fastest selling product in @entity45 history with more than a quarter of a billion sold in five years - and that 's quite something up against the @entity33 and @entity159			1
‘ but sales are starting to decline as smartphones are getting bigger and rivals are getting better			0
‘ @entity1 numbers were always going to fall at some point because they had a huge market share to begin with - 75 per cent after the first year of @entity1 - and that was always unlikely to be sustainable once the competition got involved			1
‘ it 's being squeezed from both sides by “ phablets ” like @entity170 and even the @entity171 , but also on the other side by hybrid laptops like the @entity174 3			0
‘ @entity175 and trends change			0
right now , it 's all about larger screen smartphones and full metal bodies			2
tablets are not top of the wanted list for consumers right now , but that does n't mean they never will again			0
’ all is not well for the @entity1			0
the rise of new devices like the @entity187 ( left ) and larger smartphones like the @entity171 ( right ) mean the place for the @entity1 in today 's market is becoming less obvious ‘ to some extent it ’s @entity45 ’s own fault , ’ said @entity191 , deputy editor for @entity192			1
‘ with bigger screens on its iphones , consumers are n’t using their @entity197 like they used to			0
‘ the new macbook is going to dent the @entity1 even further - that machine is like a @entity200 with an @entity1 engine , a real sofa - surfers ' device			0
‘ @entity45 wo n't let the @entity1 die though , so we fully expect an @entity205 later this year ’ on whether @entity45 might consider discontinuing the @entity1 , though , he said he ‘ ca n’t ever see that happening			2
’ he added : ‘ sales wo n’t fall off that dramatically for the @entity1 to be discontinued			2
’ apple store staff in central @entity211 welcome the first shopper waiting in line , @entity214 ( centre ) of @entity216 , the moment @entity45 's @entity217 became available for direct purchase in @entity219 on 25 march 2011			1
hundreds of customers lined up outside @entity45 stores for the launch - but will we see such numbers again ? with the release of smartphones with larger screens like the @entity171 , and other devices like the @entity187 , the place for the @entity1 today is becoming less obvious			1
but , after all , that is what they said five years ago , as well			0
will we be celebrating the 10 anniversary of the @entity1 in 2020 , though , and looking back on another successful five years ? at the moment , it looks pretty unlikely .			2
