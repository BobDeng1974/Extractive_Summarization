on a corner of a street in @entity3 in eastern @entity4 , there is a gap where a block of flats used to be			1
in the wreckage of this destroyed four - storey building lies the chilling motive behind the mass murder of 298 innocent civilians – including ten @entity13 – on @entity14			2
for @entity15 has become the main base for @entity19 president @entity18 ’s clandestine war on @entity4 , and after getting unprecedented access to this town controlled by @entity23 separatists , @entity24 can reveal that the most likely reason missiles were being aimed at the aircraft was revenge – pure and simple			1
two days before the airliner was shot down near this town , @entity3 – part of the breakaway so - called @entity32 ( @entity33 ) which has declared allegiance to @entity19 – was bombed by @entity4 air force jets , which destroyed the apartment block on @entity37 , killing five women and four men and critically injuring a young boy			1
@entity41 is the main base for @entity23 fighters in @entity4 and was bombed by government jets two days before @entity45 was blasted out of the sky as it travelled through @entity4 airspace at 33,000 feet @entity4 fighter bombers hit this apartment complex , killing nine people after hitting the building by mistake the bombers were aiming at a rebel stronghold 100 yards further down the road which acts as @entity18 's hq @entity57 , a newspaper editor in the town who helped pull bodies from the rubble , said : ‘ there is nothing but hatred towards the people who caused this tragedy			1
‘ you have to understand that when we got the little boy out of the building , the lower part of his body was totally crushed by rubble			2
the boys [ rebels ] were very angry			0
’ it is thought the sortie had been targeting a separatist military base just 100 yards away – which has become the headquarters of @entity18 ’s covert war			1
in the words of one local , the bombing attack ‘ spread panic ’			2
a day later , others are said to have died in attacks on nearby villages			0
and this seems to have set in train the chilling sequence of events which led a @entity91 anti-aircraft missile launcher to be driven across the @entity19 - @entity4 border on july 17 , and moved around @entity94 region to a field outside @entity3 , where it launched the weapon that blew the @entity98 out of the sky			1
although it is widely accepted that the @entity23 rebels mistook the airliner for a @entity4 military plane , tensions in the town were high , and locals callously explained the launch as ‘ self - defence ’			1
‘ i think taking down the @entity98 plane might be the reaction to what ’s happening in @entity3 and around our city , ’ said mr @entity57 said			1
‘ the boys are just doing their job			0
the planes bring death into our city so they could have just thought that it [ @entity45 ] was another plane that was about to bomb @entity3			1
it ’s pure self - defence			0
’ despite the @entity45 tragedy , @entity23 forces continue to fire rockets and missiles at @entity4 government targets using grad rocket launchers which have recently arrived in the conflict zone , supplied by @entity19 a column of tanks , armoured personnel carriers and rocket launchers crossed the border earlier this week and as an international team of investigators were finally allowed access to the crash site yesterday , @entity18 and his henchmen showed no sign of scaling down their aggression			1
new photographs and video images of unguided grad rocket launchers being moved across the border emerged yesterday , amid reports that a huge column of @entity19 military vehicles was massing a few miles behind the border			1
the @entity24 was the first @entity13 newspaper to be allowed to visit the centre of @entity3 , and access was only granted because we asked about the @entity4 bombing , rather than the downing of @entity45			1
to reach the town , we negotiated six checkpoints on the road from the regional capital , @entity94			2
at the last , on the edge of the town , a group of militants swaggered back and forth , armed with assault rifles			0
‘ we ca n’t let you through , there is fighting , ’ said one , sunglasses resting on his head			0
as he spoke , a family in a car packed with belongings crossed in the opposite direction			0
on the windscreen was a hastily scrawled poster with the word ‘ kids ’ in @entity19 , presumably , in case anyone mistook them for combatants			1
meanwhile , @entity4 president @entity181 inspected heavy armour near the capital @entity184 president @entity185 also received a demonstration of a fearsome silenced sniper rifle eventually , after we sent a message to the town ’s military commander explaining that we wanted to report on the attack by the @entity4 , the guards let us through			1
all smiles now where once they ’d been sullen , one said : ‘ tell the truth or we will come and find you			0
’ with that he made a throat - slitting gesture and returned to his colleagues			0
certainly few locals would have been particularly surprised to see the @entity91 mobile rocket launcher parked outside a supermarket on the afternoon of july 17 , just hours before @entity205 was shot down			1
residents said they had grown accustomed to the rumble of tanks and armoured personnel carriers moving around their town , with armed militiamen roaming the streets and setting up positions on the outskirts , in anticipation of a @entity4 attack			1
pro-russian forces have access to heavy armour and guided missile systems in are area surrounding @entity41 they said that @entity19 military hardware had been sneaked across the border into the @entity94 region under the cover of darkness in recent weeks			1
accompanied by a young man in fatigues on an old @entity19 motorbike , we drove into the centre of the town along @entity37			1
there was no fighting , but the air was thick with tension			0
‘ there was fighting this morning nearby – the @entity4 are getting closer , ’ said the soldier			1
‘ but we held them off			0
’ he leaned on a railing , listlessly smoking a cigarette as we began to interview more locals			2
they told us that at least half the population has left town because they fear more attacks , their anxiety raised by the downing of @entity45			1
‘ yes , many assume we will take the blame and fear a backlash , ’ said @entity252 , 76 , who was on his way to the chemist to try to buy medicine for his sick wife			0
‘ i go every day but they never have it , supplies are running out generally			0
there is bread but not much other food			0
there is no money in the @entity267			0
we have been taken over by the @entity33 militants			0
’ another man said it was ‘ common knowledge ’ that the rebels received much of their hardware from @entity19 and claimed his cousin spotted a convoy of tanks coming from the border a month ago			1
‘ most of the movement is at night when there is an unofficial curfew , ’ he said			0
behind him lay the remains of the destroyed four - storey @entity284 - era apartment block , once home to more than 200 people			1
was the attack on @entity205 a revenge attack after @entity4 bombed civilian flats in @entity3 by mistake now only 50 - year - old @entity291 remains			1
‘ i am not going to leave and let them win , ’ he said			0
‘ a @entity4 plane hit us at 6.30 in the morning – i was still in bed			1
the building shook and there was this massive explosion and i tried to get out of the door but it was blocked by rubble			2
so i jumped out of the window			0
’ he took us room by room through the building			2
‘ why did they attack these families ? why ? ’ after the attack , the militia began to ‘ appear more panicked ’ , according to one local			2
others spoke of seeing ‘ tanks and military vehicles ’ moving through the town later than night			0
further down @entity37 , less than 100 yards from the apartment block , we came across an empty supermarket and , adjacent , the sandbagged entrance to the militia ’s hq , a converted warehouse			1
this , several residents tell us , was the @entity4 plane ’s real target			2
‘ the rebels looked increasingly nervous after this , ’ said one middle - aged woman			0
‘ and they were angry too , really angry , shuttling all over the place in their military vehicles			0
’ the following day something else happened to intensify their fury : an attack on the nearby village of @entity337 , in which , it is claimed , civilians were killed			2
it was at this point that the rebels decided to hit back , and 12 hours later began moving the rocket launcher around @entity3			1
it was later photographed in the nearby town of @entity344 , under a tree near a supermarket			0
from there it was taken to the outskirts of @entity3 , where it was fired			2
on friday , we requested an interview with the rebel commander in the town			2
‘ he does n’t wish to speak to you , ’ came the reply from his emissary , a rifle - wielding man in his 20s			0
‘ you must go back now			0
’ back in rebel - held @entity94 , the expected major offensive from the @entity4 army to retake the city never materialised , though there were reports of blasts in a suburb			1
experts said the noise resembled those of grads			0
@entity4 security officials claim this photograph shows the vapour trail from the surface to air missile fired by @entity23 forces towards flight @entity45 as it approached the @entity19 border on its way to @entity14 in all , @entity4 ’s bloody insurgency has forced 230,000 people to flee their homes , including 130,000 who have sought refuge in @entity19			1
meanwhile , a @entity387 @entity19 senator claimed a new @entity388 had begun after the @entity389 accused the @entity19 authorities of being in part to blame for the @entity393 airliner tragedy			2
‘ after this statement we can say that a long , tough @entity388 has begun , ’ said @entity394 , a member of the defence committee of the upper house of parliament			0
and the @entity19 government accused the @entity401 of ‘ blatant lies ’ over the crash			2
the @entity404 said accusations against @entity19 were ‘ a common practice in @entity407 when no evidence nor even references to the facts are given as a confirmation , which we could have verified and commented on			2
‘ all the @entity389 says is limited to mentioning some “ intelligence data ” that can not be presented or , and – this is totally absurd – “ information from social media ”			0
’ @entity19 ’s protests , though , count for nothing in @entity3 , the town that will be for ever bound to that appalling explosion 33,000ft above them			1
‘ not all of us want to live like this , in @entity18 ’s pocket , ’ said one elderly resident			0
‘ for years we were happy – but this has changed everything			0

@entity4 fighter jets bombed an apartment complex two days before @entity45
the attack , which killed nine people , struck the wrong building in @entity3
the @entity4 were aiming at a rebel hq 100 yards further down the road
locals in @entity3 believe @entity205 was hit in revenge for the earlier attack
the @entity91 missile launcher arrived from @entity19 just hours before @entity45 blast
