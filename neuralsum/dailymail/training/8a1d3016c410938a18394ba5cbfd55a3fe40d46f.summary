the chances of beating cancer in @entity3 still lag behind those elsewhere in @entity5 , official figures revealed yesterday			1
and although survival rates for many common cancers are improving , for some types of tumour they have slid backwards despite millions of pounds being invested in research and treatments			1
data from the @entity14 show that in 2012 the percentage of patients still alive five years after diagnosis had improved for nearly all cancers , compared to the situation in 2011			2
cancer survival rates are improving , including breast cancer which has risen from 85 per cent to 85.8 per cent , prostate from 81.7 per cent to 83.6 per cent and bowel from 57.3 per cent to 57.6 per cent this includes breast cancer , which rose from 85 per cent to 85.8 per cent , and prostate cancer , up from 81.7 per cent to 83.6 per cent			1
overall , for 19 of the 24 most common cancers , patients saw improvements in survival rates thanks to earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment			1
yet for five types they stalled or got worse , including bladder cancer in women , thyroid cancer in both sexes , testicular cancer , @entity41 lymphoma in women and mesothelioma in men			2
there is no explanation as to why – and in all cases it has only been a very small decline			0
however , waiting times for vital tests to diagnose cancer have gone up recently as the @entity51 struggles to cope with the rise in patients coming forward			0
campaigners said that , despite the overall improvement , @entity3 is still well behind @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 in its survival rates			2
this has been partly blamed on gps missing warning signs , and patients not making an appointment when they first experience symptoms			0
experts say this is because women are more likely to see their gp early with symptoms whereas men ignore them and hope they ’ll go away			0
‘ @entity71 is not yet fixed , we can – and must – be trying to save more lives			0
@entity73 , head of statistical information at @entity75 , said : ‘ this increase in survival shows the power of research - thanks to better treatments , earlier diagnosis and greater awareness more people are surviving cancer than ever before			2
‘ but the story 's not so positive for all types of cancer - lung , pancreatic , oesophageal cancer and brain tumours still have relatively low survival rates , partly because they tend to be diagnosed at a later stage when they 're much harder to treat			1
over the summer , health secretary @entity94 pledged to name and shame @entity61 who were missing cancer on the @entity97 website			0
he wants surgeries which do n’t sent patients urgently for scans to be identified with a red - flag			0
although cancer survival rates are improving , @entity102 still lags behind many other @entity5 countries			1
for example , breast cancer survival rates in @entity56 and @entity106 are 86 per cent it follows an initiative by the government in 2011 to invest an extra £ 60 billion in giving gps better access to scans			1
lung cancer has one of the survival rates and only 10.7 per cent of men and 14.1 per cent of women are alive five years after diagnosis			1
this has slightly improved compared to 2012 when they were 9.7 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively .			0

survival rates for 19 out of the 24 most common cancers have improved
but they still lag well behind those elsewhere in @entity5
this is according to official figures from the @entity14
for five types of cancer survival rates have stalled or got worse
