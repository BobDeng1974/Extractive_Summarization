the £ 135,000 was spent trapping and moving water voles from the @entity1 levels ahead of dredging taxpayers have footed a £ 135,000 bill to move 50 protected water voles - at a cost of £ 2,500 per animal - to allow dredging of the @entity8			1
the bill for moving the creatures is nearly six times the original estimate , it was revealed today			0
in january and february 2014 residents on the @entity14 were forced to abandon their homes after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging			1
more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off in the wettest january since records began in 1766			1
but the @entity25 says it has a legal duty under @entity28 - backed regulations to protect the water voles as an endangered species			1
the £ 135,000 was spent trapping and moving 55 of the six - inch - long furry creatures from their bankside burrows on the @entity8 ahead of dredging work			1
in february , when the scheme was first revealed it was estimated it would cost £ 24,000 to put the tiny voles into ' winter storage '			2
but now the @entity25 has admitted that another £ 86,000 had to be spent on a ' wildlife survey '			0
previously the agency had claimed the wildlife survey was not part of the cost of relocating the voles			2
and when other costs are factored in , the total bill came to £ 135,000			1
now some @entity1 levels residents - while anxious to have rivers dredged to avoid the devastating floods from two winters ago - think the scheme is an unnecessary waste of public money			1
they say the people who approved the plan are living in @entity63 's book for children , @entity65 , featuring @entity65 - a water vole - @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity66			0
farmer @entity70 believes the voles would have moved themselves elsewhere when the dredgers began work and argues they did not need to be captured and moved 100 miles to a new home			0
residents abandoned their homes after rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland ( pictured ) were inundated with quickly rising waters in late 2013 and early 2014 and entire villages were cut off in the wettest january since records began in 1766 he said dredging often took place across the levels before the @entity25 took over , and that in the past it had never appeared to affect the vole population			1
' they 're not stupid , they 'll feel the vibration of the dredgers and move - it 's not like they have n't any other habitat to move on to , ' he said			0
' the river bank adjoins fields so they can move from the river banks to the fields , and move back once the dredgers have gone			2
' money spent on relocating the voles was a small percentage of the £ 6 millionspent on dredging five miles ( 8 km ) of the rivers @entity106 and @entity107 , the agency said previously			1
the ' rescued ' voles spent the winter in an ' over-wintering facility ' before being moved to new riverside homes in @entity112 and @entity113			0
ecology expert @entity114 said the work required professional , academically - trained people ' who hold relevant licences '			0
the @entity25 says it has a legal duty to protect water voles ( pictured ) as an endangered species the levels today , after the flooding - the voles have now been moved to a new home 100 miles away some @entity1 levels residents - while anxious to have rivers dredged to avoid the devastating floods ( pictured ) - think the scheme to remove the voles is an unnecessary waste of public money he said : ' they are undertaking sometimes long , arduous hours in the field to make sure it 's up to the standard that is required nowadays			1
' about 130,000 cubic metres of silt was removed from the @entity107 and @entity106 rivers at @entity139 after the floods devastated hundreds of homes			2
an @entity25 spokesman said ' we had a legal duty to move the voles , which are critically endangered and protected			2
' the over-wintering is necessary to ensure their survival			0
' relocating them was an essential piece of work - if we had n't moved this population of voles then it would not have been possible to complete the dredging			0
' it is unusual for the agency to undertake a substantial relocation project like this			0
' the dredging forms the first phase of the 20 - year @entity161			0
following the devastation , which took place between december 2013 and march 2014 , 8,000 metres of river was dredged at a cost of £ 6 million			1
about 130,000 cubic metres of silt was removed from the @entity107 and @entity106 rivers at @entity139			0

it has cost the taxpayer £ 135,000 to move 55 protected water voles
they have been removed from @entity8 for dredging to take place
in 2014 over 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were flooded with water after rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging
critics say moving the voles is an unnecessary waste of public money
