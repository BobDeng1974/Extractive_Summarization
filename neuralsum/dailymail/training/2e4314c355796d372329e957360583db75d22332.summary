by @entity0 in an age where being a ' protein princess ' is all the rage and ' fit not skinny ' is everyone 's favourite health mantra , you ca n't scroll through your @entity8 feed without catching sight of @entity10 doing a downward dog or @entity12 perfecting her warrior pose			1
but our favourite smug health conscious celebrities seem to have lost sight of the difference between inspiring and just plain showing off			1
the likes of @entity21 , @entity12 , @entity10 and @entity22 have been spamming our social media feeds with an array of complex yoga poses often using props such as a car bonnet , a luxury yacht or even their cooking stove			1
just practising in your back yard then , @entity21 ? the supermodel kills two birds with one stone by showcasing her incredible yoga skills and equally incredible view one of the most prolific celebrities to post selfies in complicated poses is @entity12			1
the 29 - year - old worked as an instructor for the @entity42 - based studio @entity41 before exchanging community classes for a marriage to actor @entity45 and loves showcasing her skills			0
her series of @entity48 showing her posing in awkward locations such as on her stove , on the roof of a car and even on train tracks has helped cement her status as a yoga personality - and it seems that other stars and members of the public are following suit			1
now that 's just showing off ! @entity62 has joined the craze too with some quirky moves on board a luxury yacht what 's cooking ? @entity12 takes her yoga practise where no one has been before - to the kitchen stove that 's just train crazy ! @entity12 is leading the trend for posting crazy yoga poses with the hashtag # yogapostureoftheday @entity21 , meanwhile , uses her yogi snaps to keep us up - to - date with her jet - set lifestyle and she can often be seen practising her best tree pose against a tropical background			1
@entity10 also favours this tactic , which often accrues hundreds of thousands of likes on @entity8			1
and it seems that the general public and yoga enthusiasts are following suit - but is it safe ? speaking about the rising trend , @entity90 , @entity91 and director of personal training at @entity88 , said : ' yoga is undoubtedly the " in " thing at the moment			1
from @entity10 to @entity21 , it seems like every lithe limbed celebrity is busting some seriously impressive moves on social media , and it 's catching on			1
' people usually have strong positive or negative attitudes towards yoga			1
as a @entity105 , i ’m all for anything that gets people enthusiastic about exercise and gives people an outlet to relieve stress			0
if you ’re not moving , you need to move - regardless of what it takes to do so			0
' undeniably , yoga can offer some amazing benefits			1
however , those benefits are only realised when it ’s taught correctly and tailored specifically to the individual			0
otherwise , at best , yoga can be marginally helpful and at worst , dangerous			1
@entity120 : members of the public , @entity123 and yogi enthusiasts are copying mrs @entity12 's moves humble yogi brag : it is n't just celebrities who are taking to social media to show off their moves and their holiday settings anything they can do ! members of the public have started perfecting their show - off yoga moves on tropical beaches a la @entity21 what a view : it seems that our favourite smug health conscious celebrities seem to have lost sight of the difference between inspiring and just plain showing off getting high : @entity12 is at it again , this time posing on top of a giant chimney she 's at it too ! @entity149 shows off some casual yoga moves as she chills in a bikini in her local park @entity153 : ms @entity10 , a serious yogi , makes this backbend look easy - but it is surely not ' we all know that yoga relieves stress and reduces anxiety			1
between the deep breathing , flow of new postures and positive affirmations , you ’ll undoubtedly feel better for giving it a try			0
' however , yoga can over-use the wrong muscles when performed incorrectly			1
for example , the hip - flexors are heavily recruited in many yoga moves			1
' women naturally tend to carry their weight too far ‘ forward ’ and have a tendency to over-arch the lower back because the hip - flexors ( the muscles that help us raise our legs ) are too tight ( sitting at desks all day does n’t help )			0
we do n’t want to compound this potential issue			0
the good life : two yogi enthusiasts show off their yoga pose of the day , with a fairly average backdrop a spot of sightseeing : one @entity8 user uploaded this snap with the caption : ' reaching for the sky using my yogis tools : mentally , physically and spiritually # yoga # handstandsworldwide # handstandseverywhere ' ' to get the most " bang for your buck " , instead of yoga , women are better served improving core stability , fixing postural imbalances and improving their strength through resistance training and metabolic conditioning			1
' ' overall - if you like the sound of yoga , have no glaring postural issues or musculoskeletal injuries and want to see what all the celebrity fuss is about , there ’s no harm in finding a decent practitioner and having a go			2
' be sure to remember however , that yoga is just one of a number of elements that a holistic health , physique transformation or sports conditioning exercise program should contain			2
other areas , like resistance training for strength and metabolic conditioning for fat burning , are where you should invest most of your effort			0
' balanced approach : yoga , as demonstrated by @entity231 here , takes careful instruction and coaxing into positions what 's going on here then ? @entity12 shows off some more zany yoga moves , this time seemingly posing with a workman 's hose in the centre of @entity42 the new cultural stalwart is drawing ire from the yoga community , which claims that these celebrity yoga snaps are nothing more than a publicity stunt and do little to promote the ideals of the ancient practice			1
@entity247 , a @entity42 - based yogi who runs a site called @entity249 , told the @entity250 : ‘ in a sense it mocks what yoga is			2
’ in posting a photo and inadvertently seeking followers ’ fanfare , the likes of ms @entity247 believe that celebrities negate yoga ’s original purpose			1
mrs @entity12 has spoken out in defence of her yoga photos , arguing that such ' harsh judgments ' make for the most un-yogic behavior possible			2
she wrote on @entity264 : ' true yogis dont make harsh judgements			0
so my advice to the haters : get on your yoga mat & breath & feel , until you make peace with diversity			2
[ sic ] ' stairway to enlightenment ? some experts say that @entity12 's @entity8 yoga poses are nothing more than a publicity stunt @entity90 shares his views ... @entity90 , @entity91 and director of personal training at @entity88 yoga can be good for the brain			1
advocates of yoga and meditation say it ’s great for your mind			2
yoga is claimed to boost your memory , help you focus and increase the blood flow to your brain			2
yoga rarely differentiates between good and bad range of motion			2
certain joints in our body - the ankles , hips , and upper back for instance - require more mobility training because they ’re too stable / tight			0
conversely , some joints – notably the lower back and shoulder joint – require a lot more stability training because they ’re too mobile			0
every joint in our body is designed to function with a delicate balance of mobility and stability ; some need more of one than the other			0
my main concern with yoga is the tremendous amount of lower - back bending that occurs ; this is the last thing you want if you have back pain			2
most back problems arise when we get too much movement in the lower back because we lack mobility in the hips , or our core and glute strength is too low to prevent excessive arching or flexing of the lower back			0
yoga can over-use the wrong muscles when performed incorrectly			2
for example , the hip - flexors are heavily recruited in many yoga moves			1
many of us spend all day sitting at a desk ; as a consequence our hip - flexors are stiff and tight , and need releasing rather than extra stiffening / strengthening			0
excessively limber people get injured with ordinary activities like carrying groceries , and can easily break down in sports and worsen existing aches and pains if applying advanced yoga moves in the wrong areas of the body			1
there are more effective ways to invest your exercise time			0
most of us lead very busy , modern lives			0
we want to look , feel , move , and perform at our best , and improve our health , physique or sports conditioning in the most time - efficient way			0
most women already have enough flexibility			0
i believe targeted dynamic mobility work and corrective exercises will give a lady all the flexibility she needs			0
to get the most ‘ bang for your buck ’ , instead of yoga , women are better served improving core stability , fixing postural imbalances and improving their strength through resistance training and metabolic conditioning			0
consistency , effort and determination in these areas are what get results			0
