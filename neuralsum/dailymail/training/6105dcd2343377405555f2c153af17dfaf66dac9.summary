guilty : @entity0 was living in @entity1 when new evidence re-opened the case in july 2011 a former @entity5 state policeman convicted of kidnapping and murdering a young @entity8 girl more than a half century ago was sentenced monday to life in prison			1
@entity0 , 73 , was convicted in september in one of the oldest unsolved crimes in @entity14 history and was given the maximum sentence for the 1957 murder			1
the sentencing took place in @entity19 , the small community where 7 - year - old @entity0 was abducted and killed 55 years ago			1
like @entity23 's trial , it was expected to be emotional for members of @entity25 's and @entity23 's families , as well as 63 - year - old @entity27 , a childhood friend of @entity25 's who was with her until moments before she was abducted			2
judge @entity29 admonished an unrepentant @entity23 for turning to face @entity25 's family and friends as he spoke before sentencing			2
the judge ordered @entity23 to face the bench , but @entity23 kept pivoting toward the gallery			0
' i did not , did not , kill @entity0 , ' said @entity23 , who grew up in @entity19			1
' it was a crime i did not , would not , could not have done			2
' he pointed to a box that he said contained 4,000 pages of @entity41 documents , which his lawyers argued supported @entity23 's alibi that he was not in @entity19 the day of the crime			1
the judge ruled it inadmissible because the people in the documents were dead and could not be cross-examined			0
tragic : @entity48 went missing in 1957 after a man who called himself ' @entity50 ' offered to give her a piggy back ride one night and her friend had run home to get mittens victory : @entity27 ( left ) was the childhood friend who was with @entity0 on the day that she was kidnapped support : she was joined by @entity58 , the murderer 's half - sister who testified against him in the trial @entity23 's attorney said that ruling likely will be part of an appeal			1
before the sentencing , a prosecutor , @entity65 , said that @entity23 had ' left a lifetime of emotional wreckage in his wake			0
' ' @entity0 made @entity19 a scary place , ' @entity65 said			2
' now there was a true boogeyman living among them			0
he is the definition of evil			0
' prosecutors contended that on december 3 , 1957 , a then - 17 - year - old @entity23 , known then as @entity0 , approached @entity25 and @entity27 in front of @entity25 's house and played with them for a while , offering to give them piggyback rides			1
end to the mystery : @entity82 and @entity83 , the brother and sister of @entity48 , answered questions outside the courthouse after the sentence was handed out justice : former @entity90 state 's attorney @entity89 helped prosecute the case when @entity27 ran home to get her mittens , prosecutors said , @entity23 dragged @entity48 into an alley and choked her with a wire , then stabbed her in the throat and chest			1
prosecutors say that he then loaded her body into his car and drove more than 100 miles to where he disposed of her body in a wooded area			0
@entity25 's disappearance drew national attention during a massive , months - long search before her body was found the following april			2
president @entity110 and fbi director @entity111 reportedly asked for regular updates on the case			1
ultimately , members of his own family helped convict him			0
accused : @entity0 , then 18 , went by the name of @entity0 and lived a block away from @entity0 's family in @entity19 , @entity8 but after his alibi cleared him of involvement he left and changed his name birthday girl : forensic testing showed that ' @entity48 , as she came to be known in the press , was stabbed at least three times in the throat during the trial , @entity127 , @entity23 's half - sister , described @entity23 's mother making incriminating comments about @entity23 on her deathbed in 1994			1
@entity127 claimed their mother , @entity134 had told her on her deathbed : ' @entity135 did it , @entity135 did it - and you have to tell someone			0
' she told the court : ' she was very agitated and emotional and she expressed a great deal of guilt			0
' his two other half - sisters said @entity23 never returned home the night the seven - year - old girl vanished but their mother told police he had			2
@entity149 said she stayed up until at least 11:30pm on the night the child vanished but never saw her brother come home			0
but she claimed her mother told police he had been home that evening			2
the mother acknowledged that she had lied to police when she supported @entity23 's alibi			2
after the initial 1950s case went cold , @entity127 , as he was known then , left the @entity163 area , joined the @entity164 and changed his name to @entity0			1
he had told investigators that he was on a train to @entity163 to get a medical exam before enlisting in the @entity170 , but his then girlfriend later found the @entity173 - to - @entity163 train ticket from that day that was unused and unstamped			0
@entity48 's remains were exhumed from her grave in july 2011 so that modern - day forensic scientists may be able to find dna evidence to implicate @entity23 that could not be detected in 1958			0
once a new investigation was launched , authorities went to @entity27 , @entity25 's childhood friend , and showed her an old photograph if @entity23			0
a half century later , she identified him as the teenager who came up to them that snowy day and introduced himself as ' @entity187			2
' @entity23 did not testify			0
family : @entity83 , the older brother of @entity48 , outside the @entity190 in @entity19 , after attending @entity0 's trial @entity23 was one of more than 100 people who were briefly suspects , but he had what seemed like a solid alibi			1
on the day the girl vanished , he told investigators he 'd been traveling to @entity163 for a medical exam before joining the @entity170			0
@entity48 's remains were exhumed from her grave in july 2011 so that modern - day forensic scientists may be able to find dna evidence to implicate @entity23 that could not be detected in 1958			0
@entity19 police chief @entity201 explained : ' he matched the description of the suspect , he wore the same clothing , he had the same first name ' @entity187			1
' ' we were able recently to totally disallow ( @entity23 's ) alibi with fresh information and new interviews			0
' @entity23 eventually settled in @entity1 , working as a @entity5 state police officer			1
@entity48 's murder is not the only atrocity of which the former cop has been accused of committing in the past			0
gone : @entity0 's body was exhumed last year in order to find new dna evidence after @entity23 's ex-girlfriend provided new evidence that cast his alibi into doubt @entity23 was indicted on one count of child sexual assault and four counts of indecent liberties with a child in october last year according to the @entity227 and the @entity228			1
the victim had told investigators that @entity23 raped her when she was 14 in @entity19 , the statement said			0
a probable cause statement filed by @entity1 police in conjunction with @entity23 's arrest in june said that a runaway teenage girl who met @entity23 - who used to go by the name @entity0 - in the early 1980s accused him of sexually assaulting her			1
he was convicted of unlawful communication over his interaction with the girl and fired from his job with the police in @entity246 , @entity5 , the @entity1 statement said			1
the former police officer had also been accused of raping one of his 14 - year - old half - sisters 50 years ago before being acquitted after two key witnesses changed their testimony in court in april this year			1
the alleged victim , now 64 , gave emotional testimony about being sexually assaulted by @entity0 , now 72 , and two friends in 1962 - but in the end , too much time had passed .			2
