by @entity0 open @entity1 : health secretary @entity2 , pictured yesterday at the @entity3 2013 , will outlaw ' gagging clauses ' for @entity1 staff gagging clauses which have prevented hundreds of @entity1 whistleblowers speaking out are to be outlawed			1
departing staff will instead be given a new legal right to raise issues that could be in the public interest , such as patient safety , death rates and poor care			1
last night health secretary @entity2 insisted that creating a culture of ‘ openness and transparency ’ across the @entity1 was vital to prevent a repeat of the @entity19 scandal , in which as many as 1,200 patients died			1
in an interview with the @entity22 , he said that so - called ‘ compromise agreements ’ , under which @entity1 staff can not raise anything embarrassing to their employers when they leave their jobs , would be barred with immediate effect			1
‘ there has been a culture where people felt if you speak up about problems in the @entity1 you did n’t love the @entity1			1
actually , it ’s exactly the opposite , ’ the health secretary said			2
‘ we need a culture of openness and transparency if we are going to stop another @entity40 from happening			2
' the era of gagging @entity1 staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end			1
’ senior figures in the @entity1 had warned that the case of whistleblower @entity48 , who broke a gagging clause to speak to the @entity22 about high death rates , was the tip of the iceberg			1
@entity53 want to question embattled @entity1 boss sir @entity54 about £ 14.7million of taxpayers ’ money spent over three years on almost 600 ‘ compromise agreements ’ with departing staff			1
an estimated 90 per cent of the documents contain gagging clauses which ensure potential whistleblowers are silenced , but there have been growing calls for the practice to be stopped			2
the health secretary said : ‘ we are just going to ban them			2
all these compromise agreements have to be approved by the @entity68 and the @entity69			1
‘ we are now saying we wo n’t approve any with a confidentiality clause that prevents people speaking out about patient safety or patient care			0
' we will make sure there is a specific clause in them saying that nothing in them can prevent people speaking out on issues such as patient care			0
‘ @entity40 happened because there was a culture of covering up problems			0
we need to encourage front - line @entity1 employees who see problems to come forward , in the first instance to tell their own institution about them but then having the ability to go beyond that if they do n’t think anything is being done about their concerns			1
gagging culture : @entity1 boss @entity54 , pictured speaking at the same event as the health secretary yesterday , may be questioned over the £ 14.7million of taxpayers ' money spent on ' gagging ' departing staff first step : health secretary @entity2 said the ban on gagging is only part of the government 's response to what happened at @entity40 ‘ that culture of openness and transparency is at the heart of what we are going to try to do to drive up standards across the @entity1			1
‘ this can only be part of our response to @entity40			0
if we have a culture where whistleblowing is necessary then obviously something has gone wrong			0
’ mr @entity2 said a new chief inspector of hospitals would be charged with ‘ creating a culture of consistent striving for excellence ’			1
‘ the chief inspector will examine lots of areas , but one third of the entire score for a hospital will be based on patient experience – the extent to which patients would recommend your hospital to friends and family , the extent to which your complaints procedure actually listens to people , ’ the health secretary said			1
‘ in too many hospitals , staff think that patient care is something you do when you have done everything else			2
’ previous headlines : the @entity22 reporting on the whistle - blowers on february 15 this year mr @entity48 claimed he was sacked as chief executive of @entity153 on a trumped - up charge after raising concerns about patient safety			0

he broke the terms to speak out last month about a ‘ culture of fear ’ in the @entity1			1
he claimed sir @entity54 ignored him when he raised concerns about patient safety in 2009			0
despite indications that support for sir @entity54 is waning in @entity167 , mr @entity2 said he had an ‘ honest disagreement ’ with those calling for the head of the @entity1 to resign			1
‘ i do n’t think he was personally responsible for @entity40			0
he was part of a whole targets culture that went badly wrong so he has responsibility in the same way that all managers did , ’ he said			0
‘ but he also led the campaign to bring down mrsa rates and bring down waiting lists			0
’ ministers also fear the disruption that would be caused by sir @entity54 ’s exit in the next few weeks , with 30,000 people in the @entity1 due to start new jobs on april 1 as a result of the government ’s @entity1 reforms			1
sir @entity54 is due to appear before mps investigating disastrous health service it projects next week , but members of the public accounts committee also want to question him about his own expenses claims			2

sir @entity54 would not take questions and @entity1 press officers asked tv crews not to follow him around during the rest of the @entity1 conference			2
he is under pressure to resign over his role in the @entity40 scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died between 2005 and 2009			0
