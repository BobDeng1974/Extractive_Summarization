@entity0 was booked for diving in the opening stages of @entity4 's trip to @entity5 , despite @entity5 defender @entity6 making clear contact with him inside the penalty area			1
referee @entity9 booked the @entity10 despite the appeal from @entity4 players , and the visitors had a right to feel aggrieved			1
here , @entity16 's resident refereeing expert @entity15 gives his view on the decision			2
@entity6 makes clear contact with @entity0 as the @entity10 falls to the ground inside the box @entity9 books @entity0 as @entity4 players go to remonstrate with the official with @entity0 pleading his innocence @entity25 said on @entity26 at half - time : ' that could be one of the worst decision i have seen this season			1
how has he [ the referee ] missed that ? ' @entity9 , often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees , made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed @entity6 wipe @entity0 out for a stonewall penalty			1
as if that was not bad enough @entity9 then rubbed salt in the wound by showing @entity42 a yellow card for diving ! however , @entity4 won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that @entity9 made such a blatant mistake – after all he is human ? well i think it does			2
firstly @entity0 has a yellow card to his name that , however wrong , can not be over turned			2
he could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions			0
next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the @entity54 statistics and be forever against @entity0 ’s record			0
so why did @entity9 make such a basic error and can he improve ? his first decision of the game was a very good one but perhaps contributed to the error with the @entity0 incident			1
when @entity61 slid across @entity62 in just the seventh minute @entity9 , despite not having the best viewing angle , did not hesitate to give a free - kick and caution the @entity5 player			0
this was despite @entity61 ’s vehement denial that he had done anything wrong and had in fact played the ball			0
other @entity5 players pressurised @entity9 , querying his decision , perhaps hoping to influence the referee and get into his head early on			2
@entity76 is no cheat - @entity77 @entity0 is clearly fouled inside the area by @entity6 , but was booked for the dive inside the opening 10 minutes despite replays proving that @entity9 was 100 per cent correct to both award the free - kick and to caution @entity61 i think he doubted himself and so when called upon to make a big decision , a penalty kick , he got it wrong by doubting what he saw			1
confidence is an important ingredient in good performances , whatever you are doing ; if you are refereeing at the top level it is vital			0
@entity9 ’ confidence has always been fragile which perhaps offers evidence as to why so many people question his ability to perform at this level			0
i question those who appoint him to such a high profile game , second versus third in the @entity54 .			0

@entity0 was brought down in the area by @entity6 early on
despite making contact , referee @entity9 booked @entity0 for a dive
it was one of the worst decisions of the season , says @entity15
@entity9 is considered the weakest member of the select group of referees
@entity25 said it was one of the worst calls he *'d* seen this season
