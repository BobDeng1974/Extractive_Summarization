by @entity0 junior defence minister @entity1 revealed that almost 10,000 experiments were conducted on animals at military research base @entity5 last year the number of animals being used for military experiments has increased by more than 1,000 in the last three years			1
almost 10,000 pigs , rabbits , monkeys and rodents were used in top - secret tests at the @entity5 military research base in @entity16 last year , it has emerged			1
the figures were revealed by junior defence minister @entity1 in response to @entity20 mp @entity19 who raised concerns about the facility in parliament last month			1
the @entity24 highlighted ' disturbing and cruel ' experiments which include live pigs being blasted with explosives and forced to inhale mustard gas , monkeys being infected with anthrax and guinea pigs being killed with nerve agent			1
and the number of procedures being carried out is on the up			1
mr @entity1 listed the number of animal procedures undertaken at @entity5 over the last three years			1
the figure has risen from 8,452 in 2009 to 9,582 in 2010 and 9,882 last year			2
currently 21 licensed animal procedures are under way at @entity40 ( @entity41 )			2
most of these fall into the ' substantial ' severity category which may cause ' significant or prolonged animal suffering '			2
@entity20 mp @entity19 said he was shocked by the number of animal experiments being carried out at @entity5 in @entity16 every year six of the projects cover work funded directly by @entity50 defence agencies			1
mr @entity19 said he was shocked by the statistics which , until now , were never made generally public			2
he said : ' i was shocked to learn that almost 10,000 animal experiments are taking place at @entity5 every year , including ones inflicting substantial levels of suffering			0
' the details were not included in the annual statistics published by the @entity59 and many people will be totally unaware that this suffering is occurring			0
' it is important that the @entity63 routinely gives more information on its use of animals so the public can be fully informed			0
' mr @entity1 stressed that @entity41 operates in ' strict accordance ' with the @entity69			1
' all the research projects that involve animals are licensed by the @entity59			0
as part of the licensing process , the researchers have to convince the @entity59 that the work is required , that the results can not be obtained without the use of animals and that every step has been taken to minimise pain and suffering to the animals involved , ' he said			0
but @entity24 chief executive @entity82 said : ' it is alarming that almost 10,000 animal experiments for military purposes took place in 2011 and that many animals were subjected to the most extreme suffering categorised by the government			2
' some of the animal research conducted at @entity5 was even funded by the @entity50 defence agencies			0
' the @entity24 is calling for an end to the use of animals , including monkeys and pigs in these gruesome experiments			1
we need to ensure the safety of soldiers and civilians but the answer does not lay in blowing up or exposing animals to lethal chemical warfare and nerve agents			0
' campaigners say the military research on animals such as pigs is ' gruesome ' and any evidence it saves lives is ' questionable ' all scientific experiments on animals , including those at @entity5 , have to be licensed by the @entity59 under the proviso that suffering is minimised as much as possible			1
procedures are graded according to the severity of harm or suffering they inflict			0
of the 21 ' active ' projects at @entity5 , four are ' unclassified ' , three are ' mild ' , six are ' moderate ' and eight are categorised as ' substantial '			0
a moderate procedure may cause animals a ' noticeable degree of pain , suffering , distress or lasting harm ' , according to the @entity59 definition			0
substantial severity ' may cause a major departure from the animal 's usual state of health or well - being with significant or prolonged animal suffering ' .			0
