so , will @entity0 be happy after sunday ’s @entity2 season finale in @entity3 ? the @entity4 , who must finish second to guarantee the title , was , despite the semi-smiles and waves to the crowd , somewhat downbeat after @entity9 stormed to pole in qualifying			1
@entity0 was unable to match the supremacy of his @entity13 team - mate , but will take some comfort from the fact he starts directly alongside his rival for tomorrow ’s race			1
@entity0 has hinted at a career in music after he hangs up his racing gloves , but it is @entity22 who will take centre stage later on saturday when he headlines tonight ’s after - race concert on @entity50			1
@entity22 , seen garage hopping during saturday 's qualifying session and pictured speaking to former spice girl @entity30 , is the artist also responsible for the hit ‘ @entity55 ’			2
it 's an adjective which could be used to describe @entity9 if he claims the championship this weekend			2
@entity0 will start behind pole - sitter @entity9 for sunday 's title - deciding @entity59 prince @entity61 shares a joke with @entity30 in the @entity33 garage in @entity3 @entity0 failed to put together his best lap and will start second with @entity65 breathing down his neck the @entity67 has won five fewer races than @entity0 this year , but would pinch the title if he wins on sunday and @entity0 finishes outside the top two			1
' it was a great day again today , it all worked out well , ' said @entity9			2
' i put a good lap together in the end , but it 's only one very small step			0
it 's about the championship , not about the pole			0
' i was hoping for a @entity22 to be between us , it did n't happen , but hopefully that can be the case tomorrow			0
' my mindset now is i need to get the job done , to continue with the form i showed at the last race in @entity86			0
in any case i 'm sure it will be a great race			0
