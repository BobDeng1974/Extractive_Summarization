hundreds of passengers wait patiently to be rescued yesterday after being trapped in the @entity1			1
many took selfies and other photos of the scene as they were evacuated from a car shuttle train which hit fallen power cables eight miles in			1
the incident blocked one of the tunnel ’s two tracks for most of the day , throwing the travel plans of thousands of holidaymakers and other passengers into chaos			2
massive queues built up at @entity17 and @entity18			0
services through the tunnel is now running with long delays stuck : the @entity1 is designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside , services can still run through the length of the tunnel			1
the train broke down in the north tunnel , which runs trains from the @entity39 to @entity26			1
passengers were taken off the train via a service tunnel and onto a new train in the south tunnel , which then continued to @entity45 , returning to the correct tunnel using one of two under - water cross over points there were fears of a knock - on effect today but operator @entity53 said it hoped services would return to normal by this morning			1
@entity56 newsreader @entity55 was among those whose plans were hit			0
her @entity60 train took five hours to make the journey from @entity17 to @entity62 instead of the normal 90 minutes			1
the incident began at about 7.30am when the @entity53 shuttle service from @entity18 to @entity45 ground to a halt about a quarter of the way into its journey			1
some 20 minutes later , nearly 400 passengers – and four dogs – were ordered to abandon their vehicles and were ushered by officials and emergency services into the service tunnel that runs between the two main rail tunnels			1
they were given evacuation packs containing a pen , notepad , playing cards , torch , fan , water and wet wipes			0
passenger @entity84 said : ‘ all of a sudden i heard this crashing noise			2
it did n’t sound like the train itself had crashed but it came to a grinding halt			0
there was this scraping sound , like the cables were entangled			0
for about 20 minutes the train just stopped and we did n’t know what had happened			2
‘ eventually they said they are going to take us off because they could n’t move our train			0
’ after a half - hour wait , they walked to the other rail tunnel to board a train sent from @entity45 to pick them up			1
@entity53 blamed the incident on fallen power cables but said it was unclear how it had happened			1
a spokesman said the affected train had suddenly lost power and come to a ‘ controlled stop ’ , adding : ‘ we know it was a problem linked to the overhead power supply but we do n’t know what exactly caused it			1
’ services were delayed or cancelled as the broken down shuttle was hauled to @entity45 where , some eight hours later , the passengers were reunited with their vehicles			1
those trains that ran to and from @entity26 took it in turns to use the track that remained operational			2
many drivers booked to use the shuttle service opted to take ferries from @entity128 instead , causing long tailbacks on the @entity130			0
stuck : services from @entity17 to @entity132 to @entity133 are delayed are cancelled because of queues forming at either end of the @entity1 because of the blockage aftermath : because @entity60 also uses the same tunnel , huge queues have formed at @entity17 crowds : @entity141 have been brought in to manage problems as queues build in @entity17 ' queues are building up ' : @entity60 said it had had to cancel four services today and warned passengers to expect delays to ones that are able to run @entity60 passengers in @entity17 were warned of five - hour delays – or told their train had been cancelled and they would have to rebook			1
@entity152 , 37 , from @entity153 , going on holiday with his wife and son to @entity157 via @entity132 , said : ‘ if we ca n’t travel today and we have to rebook our connecting tickets , it could be a nightmare			2
it could cost us more than £ 1,000			0
’ @entity162 , 44 , from @entity163 , said : ‘ they said our train has been cancelled and to book another ticket , but there ’s a massive queue			2
’ @entity169 tweeted : ‘ stuck outside @entity1 entrance at @entity18 ... i ’m only going for the day ! ’ later she tweeted : ‘ crew on the 8:58 @entity17 to @entity133 were great ... & handing out free chocolate			0
’ miss @entity55 spoke to @entity56 news bulletins from the halted train to describe her ordeal			0
on reaching @entity62 , she tweeted : ‘ 5 hours later ... made it ! i ’d be delighted if it were n’t for the fact i ’m on @entity180 home in 6 hrs. in theory ... ’ also delayed was new @entity184 mep @entity183			0
he wants @entity39 to get out of @entity185 – but waited three hours trying to get in			0
@entity53 said it would work through last night to fix the power lines and hoped services would return to normal by 6.30am today			1
but there were fears the @entity190 would face disruption			0
the riders flew out from @entity193 but more than 1,000 support vehicles were seeking to cross the @entity195 by ferry last night			0
cross section : the @entity1 is about 40 metres below the sea bed , has two main tunnels and a central service tunnel connected to both at 375 metre intervals			0
the south tunnel goes from @entity26 to the @entity39 and the north from the @entity39 to @entity26 the south tunnel takes trains from @entity26 to the @entity39 and the north tunnel from the @entity39 to @entity26			2
a smaller service tunnel runs between them and is connected to both at 375 metre intervals			0
this allows access for maintenance and emergency services and also serves as a safe haven if passengers need to be evacuated from their train in an incident			1
in order to deal with blockages , the two main tunnels are each split into three ' intervals '			0
these are designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside , services can still run through the length of the tunnel			2
this is possible because the @entity1 has two undersea crossovers allowing trains to pass from one tunnel to the other to avoid and isolate a section of tunnel that is blocked			0
today almost 400 people were walked from interval two in the north tunnel into the service tunnel and then into a train waiting in interval one in the the south tunnel			1
the train then used a crossover to take it back into interval four and then along the correct tunnel that nearly always takes services to @entity26			1
throughout today trains from @entity26 to @entity39 will take the same route for ninety minutes and then will be forced to wait as trains from @entity39 to @entity26 do the same			1
this means that services will still run under the @entity195 but with long delays because of the queuing system in place until the train blocking the tunnel is removed .			2

hundreds of passengers were evacuated from inside broken - down @entity53 train on way to @entity26 this morning
the service , which carries cars , was stopped after a power problem and passengers said they heard a loud bang
*382* passengers and four dogs were evacuated to another and taken to @entity26 terminal in @entity45 to wait for cars
@entity60 also cancelled four services today and warned of major delays - asking people only to travel if necessary
