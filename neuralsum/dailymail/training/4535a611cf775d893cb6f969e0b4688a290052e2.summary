by @entity0 the skeleton of a bushy - tailed baby dinosaur that roamed @entity3 135 million years ago has been found in @entity4			1
the creature had little ' fuzzy ' feathers , almost like hairs			1
named @entity11 after the tree squirrel species @entity10 , it is the best preserved dinosaur remains ever discovered in @entity4			1
at just 72 cms ( 28 inches ) long , the fanged predator looks like a tiny @entity14			2
it is believed to have been a year - old hatchling and had a large skull , short hind limbs and smooth skin			1
@entity20 - tailed : the 135million - year - old fossil of this dinosaur , named the @entity11 , has been discovered in @entity23			1
it measures just 72cms long and is believed to have been a hatchling its vivid compression with mouth wide open also bears the outline of sharp , serrated little teeth and primitive fuzzy feathers that are more akin to hair			1
these were over its front , below the belly , and back as well as the tail , suggesting the animal 's whole body could have been covered in feathers			1
it is impossible to say exactly what killed the animal , but it has been speculated that it may have drowned			2
previously reported fossils of feathered killer dinosaurs belonged to a group called coelurosaurs that are closely related to birds and from which @entity14 and other meat - eating beasts evolved			2
but @entity11 - dug up out of limestone rock at a quarry near @entity53 in @entity54 , southern @entity23 , in 2009 - was a megalosauroid which were members of the theropods			1
dr @entity58 said : ‘ here we report an exceptionally preserved skeleton of a juvenile megalosauroid , @entity11 , from the @entity62 of @entity23 , which preserves a filamentous plumage at the tail base and on parts of the body			1
‘ the specimen is preserved in complete articulation , lying on its right side			2
’ fossils of theropods - which include @entity14 - are rare and usually fragmented			2
the best @entity14 specimens are about 80 percent preserved whereas @entity11 is about 98 percent intact			1
dr @entity58 , curator of the @entity74 and @entity75 ( @entity76 ) in @entity77 , led an international team that examined the animal			1
he said : ‘ this is one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons ever found worldwide			0
when i first saw it , it was hard to believe it was real because it was so well preserved			0
‘ it looked as if it had been made by someone to hang in their living room			0
but tests quickly showed it was genuine			0
’ he said the find was of ‘ outstanding scientific importance ’ because of the completeness of the skeleton , the presence of hair - like filamentous structures and its youth			2
dr @entity58 said : ‘ it is very difficult to say how large the animal would have grown to as an adult			0
one ca n't rule out it would have been up to eight or nine metres long but it could also have just been two or three metres			0
’ the large size of the skull in proportion to the rest of the body was a sure sign it had been very young when it died , he said			0
examinations of juvenile theropods can help shed light on the mechanisms of evolution because recent research indicates changes in the processes of growing played an important role in how creatures evolved			0
the bones of the theropod are even better preserved than those of feathered dinosaurs found in @entity124 in the 1990s			0
those are the only ones which are similarly complete , but they are millions of years younger , saud the researchers whose findings are published in @entity128			0
dr @entity58 said : ‘ the great thing about this discovery is the preservation of the bones			0
similarly complete skeletons were found in @entity124 of feathered dinosaurs			0
‘ they look great from afar but if you study them under the microscope , you can see that the bone preservation is n't that great			0
’ hair on dinosaurs has been a focus of research because it could have developed into the feathers that were first detected on fossils of @entity145 , the oldest known bird , which were found in @entity23 in the 19th century			1
that discovery suggested dinosaurs may have evolved into birds			0
dr @entity58 said : ‘ this new theropod is probably the most significant fossil found on @entity23 soil since the discoveries of the original bird @entity145			1
