@entity0 : @entity2 socialite @entity1 a ground - breaking tablet that treats psoriasis could mean an end to the debilitating pain and embarrassment suffered by thousands of @entity8 who have the disfiguring skin condition			1
after promising results in clinical trials in @entity2 , the @entity11 is now considering the use of @entity15 in the @entity8 and doctors have welcomed the move			1
' this is a huge step forward in potentially treating a much greater proportion of people suffering from psoriasis , ' says dr @entity22 , consultant dermatologist at @entity23 and the @entity24			1
' many patients are worried about the serious side effects associated with existing therapies , and trials suggest this is a very safe drug that will require minimal monitoring			1
' psoriasis is a common condition in which the immune system produces skin cells too quickly , leading to a build - up of scaly pink patches on the elbows , knees and hands , though they can appear anywhere on the body			1
about three per cent of the @entity8 population suffers , affecting up to 1.8 million people			1
one in 100 suffers an extreme form of the condition that may require hospitalisation			1
celebrity sufferers include socialite @entity1 and singer @entity50			2
@entity51 can appear at any age but usually first develops in adults under 40			0
a third of psoriasis sufferers go on to develop tenderness , pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue , a condition known as psoriatic arthritis			1
psoriasis varies greatly in severity			1
while some patients suffer only minor irritation , for others it dramatically reduces quality of life			0
depression and low self - esteem are common and psoriasis on the hands or feet can make many everyday tasks difficult , while psoriatic arthritis can cause disability			2
first - line treatment is usually moisturisers , shampoos and coal - tar preparations while more intense therapies include steroid drugs , which can have wide - ranging and unpleasant side effects if used long - term			0
ultra-violet light - similar to a sunbed - has proved effective in a percentage of patients , though the benefits last only about six weeks before another course is needed			0
current treatments for psoriatic arthritis involve injectable drugs that inhibit tumour necrosis factor ( @entity92 ) , the substance that triggers the inflammation to occur , but carry serious side effects such as nausea , infections and liver problems			0
the new treatment works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4 ( @entity101 ) , an enzyme in immune system cells , causing an anti-inflammatory effect			0
clinical trials of 1,500 adults with active psoriatic arthritis by @entity2 drugs company @entity108 have shown @entity15 to be safe and effective , significantly reducing inflammation and joint pain and swelling compared to a placebo			1
few patients ( up to two per cent ) showed adverse reactions - such as diarrhoea , nausea , weight loss and headache			0
first - line treatment is usually moisturisers , shampoos and coal - tar preparations studies on psoriasis patients have found that a third experienced a 75 per cent improvement in skin problems			2
@entity126 of the @entity127 and @entity128 in @entity129 , who carried out the study , said of the drug : ' i see this as a prime candidate for future management of psoriasis that allows us to treat a range of patients , including more moderate cases earlier on			2
' first marketed as @entity144 , it was approved in march for use in @entity2 and it is hoped the drug will become available in @entity147 later this year			1
the @entity148 ( @entity148 ) is appraising its use for psoriatic arthritis , with hopes that it will eventually also be available for general psoriasis			2
one patient keen to try the drug is @entity155 , 53 , an ex-serviceman from @entity156 who now works in a warehouse and fears his condition will progress into psoriatic arthritis			0
he suffered minor symptoms in his late 30s but dismissed them as sweat rashes for years , until psoriasis was eventually diagnosed			2
his current treatment is @entity163 , a thick @entity165 - like substance which he finds does n't rub in easily and has never fully cleared up his skin			0
' if the new drug is as effective as other treatments i 've tried but without the side effects , i 'd happily try it , as would many others i know , ' says @entity155 , who has had to take several months off work over the past seven years due to the condition			0
' the ointments can be messy , uncomfortable , and time - consuming			0
a pill that gives relief from the scaly skin and constant itching would transform my life			0
