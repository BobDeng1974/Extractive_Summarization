this is the incredible moment a brave antelope tried to shake off a hungry lioness - by trying to launch her into the air			1
the beast became the lion 's prime target for dinner , after it ran directly into a hungry pride at the @entity11 game reserve , in @entity12			1
when the young lioness finally caught up with the panicking bull , he clearly was n't about to give up without a fight - and tried to launch the lion through the air after putting in an almighty buck			1
but despite getting rid of one lion , the young kudu , a type of antelope , was soon surrounded by a huge group of ravenous lions - and before long was on the menu			1
the pursuit is on : the brave kudu tried to escape the hungry lioness - but it was not to be , and the creature finally succumbed to the herd the plucky beast became the lion 's prime target for dinner after being flushed out by other lions - causing it to run straight towards the pride right behind : the young lioness finally catches up with the panicking bull , but he clearly was n't about to give up without a fight get off ! the kudu tried to launch the lion through the air after putting in an almighty buck - but sadly it was not enough to save his life wildlife photographer @entity45 captured the incredible sequence on camera , while taking pictures at the reserve			1
@entity45 said : ' we were watching a pride of nineteen lions resting on the open banks of the @entity54			1
' two lionesses left the scene and we lost sight of them heading up the steep river bank			2
' their intentions were soon revealed when three large kudu bulls where flushed out of the bush some distance upstream			2
' in the panic , one of the bulls selected the wrong escape route			2
at full speed , he galloped unknowingly toward where the rest of the pride were laying in ambush			1
' we could see the beast steaming in from at least three hundred metres away and had plenty of time to get the cameras ready			2
' dinner is served : the kudu 's death is sad , but it also provides a meal for a whole troop of lions , ensuring a feed for the whole family wildlife photographer @entity45 captured the incredible sequence on camera while taking pictures at the @entity11 game reserve , in @entity12 but in nature , brute strength and size goes a long way , and when the elephants saw the lions , they soon scared them off ' the suspense was immense as we anticipated what might unfold			1
when the bull came among the lions , he veered toward the water in an attempt to get away			0
' one lioness was onto him and the antelope had no chance			1
' she readied herself for the leap , and in one swift motion she was upon the kudu 's rear			0
he tried to fight her off but before long , the kudu collapsed			0
' the pride swarmed around the carcass			0
with this many lions present , the feeding was over after a mere half hour			0
' interestingly it was a sub-adult from the pride that executed the takedown which was an impressive feat for a youngster			0
' at one stage , a small breeding herd of elephants came by			0
at first it looked as though they would pass without a fuss but without warning some of the members of the herd charged at the lions			0
' this was enough to scatter the lions in every direction			0
some young cubs struggled to get away as they treaded in water up to their bellies but eventually they managed to get out of harm 's way			0
