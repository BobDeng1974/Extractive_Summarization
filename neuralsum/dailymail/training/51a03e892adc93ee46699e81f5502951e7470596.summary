@entity1 is almost upon us and , while hearts and flowers help , nothing says romance quite like a glass or two of champagne			2
and while we all like a sip of @entity11 , @entity12 or @entity13 , their hefty price tags put them out of reach for the more cash - strapped			2
but having a less - than - royal bank balance does n't mean you ca n't enjoy a glass or two of champagne , thanks to the wealth of cut - price options being offered by supermarkets			1

which champagne would you recommend for @entity1 ? ' definitely the @entity131 , £ 39.99 , it has a rich flavourful style			1
for those on a tighter budget the @entity135 , £ 19.99 , which is exceptional value and tastes great			0
alternatively a style called @entity138 is made in a similar way but with a gentler fizz - try the @entity140 , £ 13.99			0

' you can get great examples for under £ 10 such as the @entity153 , £ 6.99			0
in the spirit of @entity1 , which pink fizz would you select ? ' @entity157 fizz is an obvious choice for @entity1 , and it can also be a great way to be creative as well as save some money			0
if you want champagne , the @entity160 ( £ 26.99 ) is superb			2
what would you recommend to those who are looking for a low - alcohol option ? ' @entity165 usually has slightly lower alcohol than champagne or @entity148 , but if you really want to pace yourself , the soft , fruity , slightly sweet style of @entity169 is only seven per cent			0
' i would recommend the @entity171 , £ 9.99 – it 's also delicious with puddings ! '			2
