by @entity0 this stunning floral display bursting with colour and delicate blooms looks like a prize - winning creation from the @entity6 -- but glance at the roots and you ’ll notice there ’s something missing			0
rather than growing out of a plant pot , this floral arrangement is emerging from the pages of a book and is in fact a work of the most intricate origami			0
this incredible sculpture and others by artist @entity21 are made entirely from the pages of second - hand books and inspired from the illustrations within			1
@entity25 , which took three months to create , was inspired by a 1840s book of the same name the @entity29 - based artist trawls second - hand bookshops , car - boot sales and markets for titles that inspire her			1
this piece , named @entity25 after the book its been intricately fashioned from , is part of the artist 's latest series called @entity40 , which she embarked on after stumbling across antique books on flora in a vintage bookshop in @entity44			1
‘ the book ’s covers were dusty and they looked like they had n't been opened for years , yet they were full of beautiful illustrations , ’ the artist tells @entity46			1
‘ i wanted the flower illustrations to be the first thing you saw , before having to open the book to see them			2
' a paper sculpture from the @entity57 series , which brings the book 's original illustrations to life in detail : @entity21 's jaw - dropping sculptures are a work of the most intricate origami ‘ books are very intimate , and they have a relationship with their reader			1
i was interested in removing the illustrations and text from the book and offering them out to a wider audience , ' she says			2
this work of efflorescent art , along with another two book sculptures by the artist , are currently on show at @entity29 ’s @entity78 in beyond @entity79 , an exhibition showcasing artists who use books as their medium			1
@entity21 started developing this technique in 2003 following a visit to @entity85 in 2001			2
‘ i encountered paper - art used in spiritual ceremonies , and came across techniques like origami and paper - cutting , ' she says			0
the content of the book seems to grow from the pages in @entity21 's nature in @entity95 ‘ when i returned to @entity95 , i began exploring working with paper , which led me to work with books			1
the first book - sculpture i made was using a second hand book i bought in @entity101 , ' she recalls			0
the artist , who originally studied embroidery at the @entity104 in @entity29 , has always had a penchant for quirky medium			2
‘ i ’ve always been interested in deconstructing non-art objects and then transforming them into works of art , while making them defunct of their original use			0
ten years later , @entity21 has created more than 100 different book sculptures , which cost from £ 5,000			1
migrating words : one of @entity21 's enchanting scultpures migrating words up - close : the artist uses hidden wire to create the structure in her sculptures ‘ when i began making them they were very two - dimensional			1
i have been developing my techniques , and they have become more sculptural , and some include lights and motors to add movement , ' she says			0
‘ it is a tediously slow process , working on a miniature - scale , each sculpture takes around one month to complete			0
’ @entity25 , which is created from illustrations cut from a copy from 1840 and was commissioned by @entity133 for an exhibition at @entity135 , is one of the largest of @entity21 ’s pieces to date and took approximately three months to complete			1
tales from @entity139 : the mosque commissioned by @entity141 took @entity21 two months to create another of her most challenging projects was the mosque she created for the @entity141 in @entity144 , which took two months of work			2
so what ’s the process of turning a piece of literature into a work of art ? ‘ firstly i source the book and read it , often more than once			0
i sometimes draw a sketch of the overall sculpture , and then i draw templates to cut out			0
' i cut through the pages of the book one at a time with a scalpel , and use glue to help strengthen the paper			0
' @entity160 fashioned from a copy of the famous novel careful not to give away the secrets behind her feats of artistic engineering , @entity21 adds , ‘ i use a very fine wire to suspend paper - cut elements , such as snowflakes and stars			2
' so which one ’s her favourite ? ‘ i get emotionally involved with every single piece , so it ’s hard to pick			0
but i think some of the most successful of my works are from the stories that i have had most enjoyed reading , and have lost myself in , like @entity177 , @entity178 , and @entity179			0
’ which of these enchanting creations captures your imagination ? @entity179 : a @entity179 is one of @entity21 's favourite sculptures @entity186 is currently on exhibit at beyond @entity79 , at the @entity78 in @entity188 @entity189 in the @entity190 features birds suspended from the trees in the @entity194 the artist has installed tiny lights to add drama to the piece @entity21 has made over 100 book sculptures in the past ten years @entity199 , fashioned from a vintage book of the same title , has a spooky feel the artist uses a technique using fine wire to suspend elements in her creations the @entity177 is one of the artist 's favourite creations from her works of art the girl in the @entity214 creates the feel of a breeze blowing through the trees the @entity218 is sculpted from a book of the same title for works and commissions go to longandryle.com or @entity222			1
