' a large section of @entity47 members suffer from sexual anomalies and brutal instinctive desire for sex , ' the report reads			1

it claims that the group 's first act upon completely seizing control of @entity9 last year was to ' crack down on women ' and to launch a ' vigorous search by @entity47 fighters for wives '			1
the reasons for the local marriages are three fold , the report says - firstly to tie the mostly foreign terrorists to local families , and secondly to bind the militants to the local area - giving them familial responsibilities that mean they are unlikely to desert or defect from the @entity1			0
the report says the militants have broken local rural customs , which traditionally saw young men and women marrying cousins or other relatives in order retain their family bonds			0
with @entity47 fighters demanding the local women marry them instead , the local women are said to have been left utterly miserable , and in some cases suicidal			2
the militants are understood to pay a dowry of between £ 2,000 and £ 5,000 for each marriage , depending on whether the marriage is to a woman from the city or the surrounding countryside			0
oppressed : details of the @entity40 extremists ' twisted sexual appetites emerged in a report by @entity9 is being slaughtered silently into the terror group 's brutally oppressive treatment of women as part of their so - called ' crack down ' on women after seizing control of @entity9 , @entity47 fighters demanded all women completely cover their body in public - including their hands ; insisted women only venture outdoors when accompanied by a close relative , and prevented any woman older than 50 leaving the house , except in medical emergencies			1
they also closed any centres of education catering to women , demanded women are surrounded by close female relatives if they are working , and relentlessly harassed those seen outdoors alone			0
to force local families to effectively ' sell ' their daughters to a jihadi husband , the militants took advantage of the poverty sweeping @entity9 to offer high dowries and welfare payments			0

according to @entity9 is being slaughtered silently , @entity47 even spread rumours that unmarried women were being kidnapped and never seen again - a rumour that encouraged young females into getting married out of fear for their safety if they chose to remain single			0

if they are later discovered , as many of them are , the women are either stoned to death as apostates or adulterers .			0
