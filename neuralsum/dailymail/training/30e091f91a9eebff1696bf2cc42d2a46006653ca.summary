by mail online reporter the boss of @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , who has sparked an online storm a hostel owner has stumbled into controversy after being branding a customer as a ‘ retard ’ in an online spat			1
@entity12 fired the unpleasant insult at a guest who left a negative review of his property			1
@entity17 stayed at @entity2 in @entity3 during a visit to see the ongoing @entity19			1
but after deciding that her accommodation was less than satisfactory , she vented her frustrations on the hostel ’s facebook page			1
‘ worst hostel i have ever stayed in , ’ she wrote			1
‘ @entity26 , uncomfortable , wires coming out of walls everywhere , mouldy bathrooms , only 1 working shower in the building , aggressive , foul mouthed staff & at 2am there were people having to change beds & rooms about which woke everyone else up			1
‘ no light switch in the room nevermind a plug socket ! bed was a foam mattress which did n't even cover the springs			2
@entity44 is a health hazard			2
’ her words earned the ire of mr @entity4			1
now , as the row has gone viral , the @entity50 hotelier , 46 , has defended his abusive comment – and claimed that @entity17 , from @entity53 , did not raise any concerns during her stay			1
‘ it was totally ridiculous , ’ he said			2
‘ she did n't ask anything or make a peep while she was here and was asked when she left , and said everything was ok			2
‘ four hours later i saw the review on the webpage and it was just ridiculous			2
saying things that were totally wrong			2
‘ she did n't say anything like that			2
we did have a screw up with people in her room			2
she did n't know where stuff like the showers were and she did n't ask			2
‘ after the fourth or fifth person i just started taking the piss out of them			0
just a big joke after that			0
people were calling me @entity79 and all kinds of things , and it just got blown up			0
‘ i do n't remember half the stuff that went on there			0
what can you do ? everybody just started saying all kinds of crazy stuff			0
all of a sudden it 's gone viral			1
‘ the part i stand by is when i said look you did n't ask anybody anything , all your assumptions were wrong			1
‘ nobody has any face - to - face communications any more			0
they can type on @entity96 and ca n't come down to reception and say they 're unhappy			1
angry exchange : the row has been sparked by a stay at the @entity2 which left a guest unsatisfied ‘ all your complaints could have been rectified in two seconds if you 'd asked			1
the rest of it was just a bunch of people blowing things out of proportion			0
’ in his initial online response , @entity4 claimed : ‘ we are having a new fire alarm installed , sorry , we care about safety			1
‘ the light switches are right beside the door , open your eyes			0
there are six sockets in the room you were in , they are in the wall where they normally are in most houses			0
‘ the reason people were being moved is because you retards left your door open and people came in your room that were not booked in your room			0
‘ this is why everyone must have a key and not put shoes in the doors when you go to the toilet ! ‘ not once did you come ask where showers were , if you did you would have been told the locations			0
‘ there are showers on every floor			0
' obviously you have no communication skills other than typing in @entity96			0
’ other people were quick to join the debate between the pair after @entity4 claimed the hostel was for those aged 18 - 35 and said he warned people who wanted ‘ five - star ’ service that this is n't what they will find at his establishment			1
one @entity96 user , @entity155 , wrote : ‘ you 're lucky you are n't 36 , @entity156			0
otherwise you would 've been too old to stay			0
’ @entity4 replied saying : ‘ that 's why we have a age limit , seems after 35 people bitch about everything , ohhh , i booked a 18 bed dorm and could n’t sleep ... ’ a determined @entity17 told the owner : ‘ i did n't want 5 star service ; i wanted a clean bed for the night , the ability to sleep and the ability to have a shower in the morning without scalding myself / feeling sick looking at all the mould			1
’ after the exchange went viral , users of the social networking site moved to @entity173 to post fictitious reviews of the hostel			1
someone even mocked up a picture of the hostel owner on a book cover titled : ‘ @entity180 in customer service and general satisfaction			1
’ the hostel owner remained upbeat about the online conversation which has gone viral online			1
he said : ‘ there 's no such thing as bad publicity			0
who knows what 's going to happen ? it does n't really matter			0
‘ i 've got thriving business and about 2,500 customers in a month and have about four complaints			0
' if she would have just come and asked , everything would have been sorted out , but she did n't			0
