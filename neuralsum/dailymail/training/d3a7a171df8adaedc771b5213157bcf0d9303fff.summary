by @entity1 reporter danger : a study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child 's immune system pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease			1
researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby ’s immune system			1
by contrast mothers can help to kick - start a child ’s ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs			1
a study by the @entity22 in the @entity23 showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection - fighting white blood cells			1
they found that , as with humans , mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth , but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics			1
this left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly e. coli infections , especially when they were born prematurely			2
the researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut ’s vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice			2
exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria , many of which are beneficial , and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn			2
critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution , without proof of infection			0
the study appeared in the journal @entity66			0
@entity67 , first author of the study , said : ' at birth , newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms			0
' animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life			0
' doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength , rather than medication a similar procedure in humans , called a fecal transplant , has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults			1
however , such transplants have not been performed in newborns , and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment			0
despite the findings , babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria			0
but the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long - term goal .			0

drugs tamper with *foetus* 's *developing* immune system , researchers found
makes premature babies vulnerable to diseases such as @entity114
study by @entity22 said germs help build strength
