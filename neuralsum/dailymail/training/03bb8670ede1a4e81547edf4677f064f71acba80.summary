the pictures and video below show the amazing single - stage rocket launching thousands of feet without a pilot , moving through the air and landing back in its original position -- on its tail			1
that was one of several successful launches , others of which saw the rocket reach as high as 10,000 feet , according to the learning channel video ’s narrator			2
the unmanned reusable prototype was built by @entity25 aerospace manufacturer @entity27 in conjunction with the @entity30 ’s @entity29 from 1991 to 1993			1
it was originally called the @entity47 - @entity46 on august 18 , 1993 , a small group of spectators at the @entity51 's @entity50 in @entity52 witnessed the rocket ’s first launch , according to a report from the @entity56			1
the original @entity57 flew three times at the @entity50 before the @entity30 terminated the program in late 1993			2
the rocket was then given to @entity62 scientists , who upgraded the vehicle ’s design for improved performance and renamed the upgraded prototype the @entity3			0
landing : this video image shows the single - stage rocket landing in its original position -- on its tail reusable : the @entity3 could be ready to fly again 24 hours after take - off the prototype ’s oxygen fuel tanks were built in @entity75 using lithium , the lightest of metals , while its hydrogen tanks were made of epoxy , the same material used in bullet - proof vests			1
the @entity82 would reportedly burn 90 % of its take - off weight in its first three minutes of flight			0
the redesigned rocket could be ready to fly again 24 hours after take - off			0
the @entity3 underwent its last test flight in 1996			0
on july 2 that same year , @entity62 granted a contract for another single - stage reusable launch vehicle , known as the @entity90 , to @entity91 for its @entity93 orbital spaceplane			1
small flight crew : while a space shuttle requires more than 30,000 people to launch , the @entity3 only required 15 people to take off remote control : ground crew controlled the rocket by computer from a nearby trailer lightweight : the prototype ¿ s oxygen fuel tanks were built in @entity75 using lithium , the lightest of metals , while its hydrogen tanks were made of epoxy			0
