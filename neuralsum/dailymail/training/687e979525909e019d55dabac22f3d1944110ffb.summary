by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 20:05 est , 12 july 2012 when teenage tearaway @entity2 was treated to a three - month ‘ character building ’ trip to @entity4 it was supposed to deter him from a life of crime			1
but just weeks after his £ 7,000 tour of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 ‘ @entity8 was arrested for drink driving and carrying a knife			0
now , almost 20 years and 113 offences later , @entity2 has been branded a ‘ perpetual villain ’ by a judge tired of constantly seeing him in the dock			1
laughing : hook in 1993 , left , after going on the @entity24 safari and right , now aged 35 in his latest police mugshot			2
he may look back on his life and wish he had taken the opportunity to change his ways @entity2 , 35 , was in jail last night after being sentenced at @entity31 for his latest crimes – mugging an elderly shopper and handling credit cards stolen from another woman			1
he was sentenced to 18 months in prison by judge @entity37 but because he has been in custody on remand for nine months he will be free again within days			1
in his 32nd court appearance , judge @entity40 told career criminal hook : ‘ we have been looking at each other across this court for many years			1
‘ there have been many protestations from you that you are going to become an honest citizen and behave yourself			0
so far you have n’t			0
’ he added : ‘ you have an appalling record			0
’ hook ’s 88 - day junket to @entity4 caused nationwide condemnation in 1993 and was even criticised by the then prime minister @entity55			1
junket : hook , back row second from left , poses with a group in @entity10 at the @entity58 while enjoying the £ 7,000 safari to try and stop his offending in 1993 expelled from school at 14 , @entity2 had been sent to @entity62 in @entity63 , a therapy centre for unruly teenagers			1
the trip was supposed to take him out of the environment where he had been a young offender and show him places where people were worse off than him			2
hook claims he is a direct ancestor of soldier @entity53 who won the @entity71 fighting @entity72 at @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity4 in 1879			1
but the only thing the teenager brought back from his tour of @entity4 was a determination to continue his life of crime			1
in january 1994 , just months after the trip , @entity2 appeared at @entity31 for 34 offences including burglary and taking a car without consent and he was given a year ’s supervision order			1
that year he was back in court twice for burglary offences , handling stolen goods and driving while disqualified			1
by the time he was an adult , @entity2 had blossomed into a lifelong criminal with a heroin and crack cocaine habit to feed			0
over the last 18 years he has served prison sentences for aggravated burglary , theft and wounding.in his most recent court appearance , judge @entity40 said @entity2 ’s crimes were exactly the same as when he was last jailed – for two years – in 2009 for mugging a frail 80 - year - old man in the street			1
he said : ‘ your latest offences were planned and you acted in concert with another person			2
you are a perpetual villain			1
’ @entity2 's innocent smile as a child , left , gave little indication of the terror he would inflict on his victims over the years			0
right , he laughs in in 1994 having been to court for dozens more offences after the taxpayer - funded trip hook pleaded guilty to stealing a bag from an elderly shopper in an alleyway near an @entity118 store in @entity31 in september last year			1
he also admitted handling credit cards stolen on the same afternoon from another elderly woman			0
a second man , @entity121 , 23 , was involved in the offences and has already been jailed for 18 months			1
@entity121 had been arrested soon after the offence and the court heard how @entity2 had called @entity125 claiming he had witnessed the robbery and tried to stop the assailant			1
prosecutor @entity128 said : ‘ he was aware the robber had been arrested and he was worried he might be implicated because his fingerprints might be found on the stolen property			0
’ judge @entity40 was unimpressed by @entity2 ’s actions saying : ‘ it was a pre-emptive strike by him to try to explain his fingerprints			2
’ @entity2 denied any involvement in the offences but was arrested and charged			2
safari : giraffes walk across a plain in the kind of scene that @entity2 was treated to when he was a teenager			0
unfortunately having the kind of holiday that most people dream of did little to temper his offending undeterred by his arrest , @entity2 went into @entity147 ’s in @entity31 two weeks later with credit cards taken from both women and tried to use them			2
@entity151 , defending , said : ‘ he knows you well , your honour , and he does n’t want to shilly - shally with you			2
‘ he is 35 and he has got a four - year - old daughter			1
he has not seen her since he was remanded in custody because her mother will not take her to prison			0
illustrious ancestor : @entity2 claims he is a direct descendant of soldier @entity53 who won the @entity71 fighting @entity72 at @entity161 in @entity74 , @entity4 in 1879 ‘ you may have heard it before but i have no doubt of his sincerity when he says he never wants to be here again			1
’ judge @entity40 responded : ‘ i do n’t want him here again			2
’ mr @entity151 said that while on remand @entity2 had been treated for his drug addiction and had become the jail ’s race relations representative			0
but the judge said the only factor in @entity2 ’s favour was that he had pleaded guilty			2
he sentenced him to 18 months for theft and six months for handling stolen goods			1
the sentences will run concurrently			0
@entity2 ’s mother , @entity180 , has blamed her son ’s continued life of crime on the fact that social services lavished money on him instead of punishing him			0
she has said previously : ‘ they spoilt him rotten and did not prepare him for real life			0
’ but @entity2 has been adept at manipulating the system			0
in 2001 he admitted sending a forged doctor ’s note to court so he could spend @entity193 at home			2
then in 2009 he pledged to work with the @entity195 on a scheme where experienced burglars helped householders to improve their home security			0
@entity2 was one of a host of young offenders pampered by the justice system in the 1990s in a misguided attempt to put them on the straight and narrow			0
in previous years , the delinquents would have been locked up in borstals or sent to approved schools			0
burglar : @entity209 , also known as @entity210 , grew up to be a drug addict who targeted the elderly but in the mid- 1990s they had become ‘ disadvantaged young persons ’ who were given all the help the taxpayer could afford			2
@entity209 was treated to a three - month £ 12,000 barge holiday in 1997 in an effort to deter him from crime			2
the 15 - year - old became known as ‘ @entity210 ’			1
he grew up to be a drug addict who specialised in raiding the homes of the elderly			0
in 2001 he was jailed for three years for stealing from a 91 - year - old great - grandmother and in 2009 he got five years for carrying out 22 burglaries while on parole			1
his brother @entity228 earned the name ‘ @entity230 ’ when he was paid £ 60 a week after 37 arrests between 1992 and 1994			0
after paying out £ 1,560 , social services stopped the money because his offending increased			0
@entity235 was branded ‘ @entity242 ’ after going on holidays costing the taxpayer £ 50,000 to ‘ instil feelings of self - worth by broadening his horizons ’			1
but @entity235 , now 39 , progressed to a life in and out of jail for crimes including conspiracy to rob a post office , burglary , fraud and car crime			0
he even tried to sue social services claiming he had not been taught basic life skills such as how to claim benefits .			0

taxpayer - funded jaunt to @entity4 in 1993 was supposed to stop offending
within a year he was back in court over 34 offences
branded ' perpetual villain ' by judge after a series of appearances since
jailed for 18 months for mugging *pensioner* but he *'ll* be free within days
@entity268 claims to be descendant of @entity53 , hero soldier of the @entity270
