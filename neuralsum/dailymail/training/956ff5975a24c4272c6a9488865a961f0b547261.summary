@entity1 defender @entity0 believes a homegrown spine of @entity4 players is the reason behind the club 's astonishing revival in the last two months			1
at the end of september , a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity9 meant discontent from @entity1 supporters at their woeful start to the season was turning venomous towards manager @entity15			1
but since that game they have only lost once more on a run of form that has seen them rise to seventh in the @entity21 , handing @entity22 their first defeat of the season along the way			1
@entity26 ( left ) closes down @entity27 ( right ) of @entity22 in @entity1 's 2 - 1 victory last weekend @entity29 ( centre ) scored both goals as @entity1 handed @entity22 their first defeat of the season and @entity0 believes the @entity33 core of @entity15 's side has been a huge influence			1
' we are used to being fans of @entity1			2
we know what it feels like to be on the terraces			0
we know what it takes to please the fans			0
we have to do well and represent our area , ' @entity0 said in an interview with the @entity46			0
' i think it does matter having @entity1 in there			2
it helps ground the club and have a link the area			0
' @entity0 believes the result at @entity55 last weekend against @entity22 demonstrates the impact homegrown players can have upon the team			1
' i have been thinking about it this week			0
we had @entity61 , who played for @entity62 but is from @entity63			0
@entity1 boss @entity15 ( centre ) survived the calls from fans for him to lose his job earlier in the season ' @entity69 ( until he was sent off after 83 minutes ) from @entity70 , @entity71 on the left wing from @entity73 and @entity74 in for his debut in goal			1
' @entity1 travel to @entity78 to take on @entity79 in the late kick - off on saturday , knowing victory would see them overtake @entity84 's side and move to sixth in the table .			2

after a wretched start to the season , @entity1 are seventh in the league
they have *beaten* sides such as @entity22 , @entity93 and @entity94
@entity96 believes the @entity33 spine of the side has helped
