an @entity1 oil tanker that disappeared from radar off the coast of @entity4 last week has suddenly reappeared today - and it 's still full of $ 100million in crude			1
the @entity6 is at the center of a legal and political battle over @entity1 's oil wealth between the @entity11 region in the north of the country and the central government in @entity15			1
the tanker vanished from @entity18 tracking systems on thursday and is believed to have shut off its transponder			0
the ship , which has 1million barrels of crude oil aboard , reappeared on radar on monday - in almost exactly the same spot where it was when it vanished			2
it 's currently in the @entity26 , where large ships that ca n't fit in the @entity28 wait to be unloaded			0
as the disintegration of @entity1 amid mounting violence continues , the semi-autonomous regime in @entity11 is trying to cash in on @entity1 's oil reserves and export its own crude			1
oil tanker @entity34 ( also known as the @entity6 ) , which is carrying a cargo of @entity11 crude oil , approaching @entity26 , @entity4 on july 25			1
the boat disappeared from @entity18 radar on thursday a still image from video taken by a @entity44 @entity18 @entity43 aircraft shows the oil tanker @entity45 sitting in the @entity46			1
it reappeared on radar on monday @entity1 @entity11 has exported at least eight million barrels of oil since may , energy experts told @entity51			1
but the increasingly weak regime in @entity15 is trying to keep control of its oil billions and says the @entity11 regime can not sell the oil in the @entity44 the @entity18 's @entity58 ship - tracking system showed no position for the @entity6 on thursday , which was carrying one million barrels - and was 95 per cent - when it went dark			1
the tanker was attempting to unload its cargo at sea , off the coast of @entity4 , after leaving the @entity68 port of @entity69 in june and anchoring near the @entity44 port of @entity26 in late july			1
the @entity18 confirmed to @entity71 today that the last contact the agency had with the @entity34 was when the ship 's certificate of compliance was completed on july 27			0
the vessel 's disappearance was thought to be the latest development in a high - stakes dispute between @entity15 and the @entity11 over the right to export oil			2
several other tankers transporting disputed oil from @entity85 or @entity11 have switched off their transponders before unloading their cargo - making their movements extremely difficult to track			2
a @entity18 official told @entity71 today that the vessel might have turned off its beacon in the @entity46 , which it is not supposed to do			0
legal dispute : the vessel 's disappearance is thought to be the latest development in a high stakes argument between @entity15 and the @entity11 over the right to export oil the tanker @entity99 , which had been carrying a partial load of crude oil from @entity1 @entity11 turned off its satellite transponder on august 17 , north of @entity104 's @entity103			1
it reappeared unladen on august 19 about 30 kilometers off the coast of @entity107 , ship tracking data on @entity110 showed last week			0
it was not possible to determine where the oil had been delivered to or who the buyer was			0
a spokesman for the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) @entity117 would not comment on the tanker 's temporary disappearance at the time			0
@entity110 reported on july 31 that tanker @entity122 , which was carrying more than 1 million barrels of @entity11 oil , had been offloaded into another tanker in the @entity127			1
a senior executive at @entity129 confirmed in july that the ship - to - ship transfer involving the @entity122 took place in a ' legitimate operation '			0
the ship is ' fixed to a legitimate charterer and performing legitimate operations , ' said @entity136 , the chartering manager at @entity129 ' the ship is still in international waters , ' he added			0
the agency has a @entity43 aircraft at its disposal which last took images of the oil tanker @entity45 on july 25			0
only a few days ago , the partially - full @entity99 tanker carrying @entity11 crude oil , disappeared from satellite tracking north of @entity104 's @entity103			2
two days later , the empty vessel reappeared near @entity107			0
in late july , the tanker @entity122 offloaded part of its cargo of @entity11 crude oil onto another ship in the @entity127			2
the evasive behavior is the result of @entity15 wanting to block the @entity11 from exporting the oil as they believe they have the exclusive right to do so			2
the @entity1 government in @entity15 has filed a lawsuit in a @entity44 court to reclaim control of the @entity6 cargo and block the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) from delivering its cargo			1
the suit demonstrates that @entity15 is now stepping up their legal and diplomatic push to block @entity11 's oil deals , which they view as smuggling			1
however , the @entity11 see such deals as crucial to their own dreams of independence			0
on monday , the @entity44 court threw out the order saying it lacked jurisdiction to seize the tanker as it disappeared some 60 miles off their coast			1
but the judge invited @entity1 to re-plead its case over the cargo 's rightful ownership			2
the issue is expected to fuel tensions between @entity181 and @entity15 , as in theory , @entity1 can file claims against anyone taking delivery of the oil			0
a @entity18 official said the vessel in the @entity46 might have turned off its beacon , sailed beyond antennas that monitor transponders , or perhaps some antennas might have been taken out of service			0
however , dozens of vessels were visible on thursday in the @entity26 , where the @entity11 tanker was last seen			0
the @entity6 's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high - stakes dispute between @entity15 and the @entity11 over the right to export oil			1
