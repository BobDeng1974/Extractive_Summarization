the @entity8 was set to premiere the orchestral work on sunday at the prestigious concert hall but the orchestra 's management removed it , saying that such an explosive musical reference required a longer conversation			1
no one has suggested any @entity7 sympathy by composer @entity17 , a 21 - year - old @entity19 @entity18 , who intended for the work to deplore war including recent bloodshed in @entity23			1
composer : the @entity8 canceled @entity17 's ' @entity25 ' after management realized it featured a snippet of a @entity7 @entity6 anthem piece : @entity17 uploaded this photograph of his work ' @entity25 , ' which is @entity23 for ' march to @entity32			1
' it featured both a portion from the @entity7 song ' @entity36 ' and the anthem of @entity38 - ruled @entity23 but the controversy raised a broader question -- how explicitly do artists need to state that allusions to history 's darkest chapters are meant to condemn rather than condone ? the @entity8 , which recognizes performers and composers under age 22 , said @entity17 only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of ' @entity36 , ' one of the @entity51 ' main anthems which is banned in modern @entity6 and @entity52			1
the symphony said that the nine - minute piece could have been ' an important teaching moment for our students ' but that @entity58 refused to lay out his reasons for using ' @entity36			1
' ' without this information , and given the lack of transparency and lack of parental consent to engage with this music , we could not continue to feature his work on the program , ' the symphony said in a statement			2
' we believe deeply in a free creative process			0
but along with freedom comes responsibility , even more so when young people are involved , ' it said			0
@entity17 had entitled his work ' @entity25 , ' which is @entity23 for ' march to @entity78 , ' and it also incorporated the anthem of @entity38 - ruled @entity23			1
he initially explained his work only with a dedication in the program ' to the victims of hunger and fire ' and an excerpt from @entity88 's @entity87 i poem ' @entity90			2
' ' between the conception and the creation / between the emotion and the response / @entity95 , ' runs the verse from @entity88 , who is often considered the premier 20th century english - language poet but also faced accusations of @entity99			0
disclosure : the @entity8 said @entity17 only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of ' @entity36 , ' one of the @entity51 ' main anthems			1
the song is banned in modern @entity6 and @entity52 upset : after @entity58 's @entity1 ( pictured ) debut was cancelled , @entity17 spoke more at length , saying he was ' disappointed and confused ' by the rejection of a piece ' not meant to provoke , but to evoke intent : @entity17 has said the piece is ' devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war , totalitarianism , polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today ' music speaks for itself ? after the cancelation , @entity17 spoke more at length , saying he was ' disappointed and confused ' by the rejection of a piece ' not meant to provoke , but to evoke			1
' the piece '' s devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war , totalitarianism , polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today , ' he said in a statement			2
' the old joke about how do you get to @entity1 -- you practice			0
apparently , you also have to self - censor			0
i 'm disappointed that this work will no longer have the ability to speak for itself , ' he said			0
@entity17 , who is studying at the @entity137 in @entity138 , said that the orchestra had been practicing the piece for weeks without any complaints			1
the controversy has echoes of a furor last year at the @entity145 which staged @entity147 ' ' the death of @entity148 , ' about the wheelchair - bound @entity148 who was killed by @entity150 hijackers of a cruise ship in 1985			0
protesters rallied outside and several disrupted performances in part because @entity150 characters in the opera make anti-semitic remarks as @entity147 tries to set the context for the killing			0
@entity160 , deputy national director of the @entity161 , which fights anti-semitism and racism , said that he could not judge the canceled @entity1 piece without listening to it but urged reflection before banning artwork that cites offensive material			2
' i assume that the @entity8 did what it did out of good motives			0
but i would also say that in works of art , one has to be thoughtful and careful before one wants to censor , ' he told @entity174			0
the orchestra went ahead sunday with a performance that featured rising violinist @entity177 , who performed @entity178 and @entity180 's ' @entity179			2
