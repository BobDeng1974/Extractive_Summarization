@entity7 is readying for the launch of its breakfast menu at all 5,500 locations on march 27 , with items such as the @entity12 designed to appeal to its fan base of younger men			1
the addition of breakfast will be the largest menu expansion for @entity7 in the chain 's 50 - year history			2
and the chain says breakfast will be available until 11am â € ” a half hour longer than @entity21 's offers its @entity22			1
' we can turn the breakfast conversation into a two horse race , ' @entity7 president @entity23 said in an interview , noting that @entity7 intends to be a ' strong no. 2 ' after @entity29			0
scroll down for full menu @entity31 for breakfast : @entity7 will start serving breakfast at all 5,500 @entity34 locations starting march 27 @entity21 's has long been the fast - food leader in the mornings , with its popular @entity37 , hotcakes and other items pulling in roughly 20 per cent of the company 's @entity34 sales			1
but the chain has been facing stiffer competition in recent years , with competitors such as @entity45 and @entity46 rolling out breakfast sandwiches as well			0
it 's not clear how @entity7 's entry into breakfast will alter the fast - food landscape			1
last year , an executive with @entity7 's parent company @entity53 said that breakfast accounted for about 4 per cent of sales in locations where it was tested			2
but that was before the chain put its full marketing might behind the menu , he noted			0
@entity21 's , which has more than 14,000 @entity34 locations , has also said it plans to step up its marketing of breakfast this year as it faces intensifying competition			1
the president of @entity21 's @entity34 , @entity66 , said that the chain is in the early stages of looking at whether it can extend its breakfast hours			1
@entity66 noted that cutting off breakfast on the weekends at 10:30am ' does n't go very well ' with people in their 20s and 30s in particular			0
still , figuring out how to serve both breakfast and lunch poses an operational challenge given the limited kitchen space in restaurants			0
watch your back @entity5 : the chain is expanding to breakfast in order to compete with @entity21 's in the meantime , @entity82 , @entity34 brand and strategy officer for @entity29 , seemed unfazed in an interview late last week by @entity7 's plans to start serving breakfast			1
' i think they 're going to find that going into the breakfast business is not like what they 're accustomed to , in terms of marketing , ' @entity82 said			0
the addition of breakfast is a major undertaking that requires training existing workers , hiring more staff to cover morning shifts and buying new equipment			0
@entity7 , for instance , is bringing in new equipment to its nearly 6,000 @entity34 locations to start serving coffee for the first time			2
to keep operations simple at the start , @entity23 said the chain will start with drip coffee before expanding to specialty coffees such as lattes			0
