by @entity0 and @entity1 a leaked memo reveals that high - ranking executives at @entity4 admit the excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly their fault			1
taking the blame : an internal memo from @entity4 coo @entity9 blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics the company 's chief operating officer @entity9 says in his memo that the nagging , begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by @entity16 was part of what @entity4 paid and trained the employee to do			1
' it was painful to listen to this call , and i am not surprised that we have been criticized for it , ' @entity9 says in the document first leaked to @entity26			1
the memo surfaced just a week after the call to @entity29 founder @entity16 -- who recorded it and put it on @entity32 , where it 's now been played over 5 million times -- went viral			1
' we are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to the customer ’s desire to discontinue service , ' @entity9 wrote			1
@entity4 has since confirmed the authenticity of the call and issued an apology			2
' we are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to the customer ’s desire to discontinue service , ' @entity9 wrote			1
' why is it that you do n't want the faster speed ? help me understand why you do n't want faster @entity50 ? ' demands the @entity4 rep in one portion of the call after @entity16 asks to cancel his service			1
despite @entity16 being adamant that he wanted to cancel , the employee told him that he had to be given a good reason or he would n't do it			0
this ' rude , unhelpful and condescending ' behavior was ' straight up belligerent ' according to a stunned @entity16			0
only eight minutes of the call were recorded because @entity16 's wife was on the phone to the rep for the first ten , during which he acted in the same way to her			2
interrogated : @entity16 was confused by the unyielding attitude of a @entity4 employee who refused to let him cancel his service with the cable giant unless he gave him a good reason ' i started the call by ( very nicely ) saying that we were moving , and that we needed to cancel our service , ' @entity16 's wife , @entity71 , wrote in the description of the recording on @entity32			1
' he asked if we wanted to move our current service			0
i said no , thank you , but we ’ve already signed up for @entity80			0
' ' the representative continued aggressively repeating his questions , despite the answers given , to the point where my wife became so visibly upset she handed me the phone , ' @entity16 wrote in the audio description			0
' overhearing the conversation , i knew this would not be very fun			0
' as fellow annoyed consumers across @entity93 soon learned , it was not very fun.despite that , @entity16 would -- like @entity9 -- come to the employee 's defense , at least in a way			2
in a statement to @entity98 , he too blamed the system that created the customer service rep and not the rep himself			2
' customer retention and other @entity104 departments often provide financial incentives to representatives to prevent customers from disconnecting ( among other things ) , ' he told @entity98			0
' that system effectively pits a representative and the customer against one another			0
everyone loses — except maybe the cable company 's bottom line , sometimes , if they ' save ' an account			0
