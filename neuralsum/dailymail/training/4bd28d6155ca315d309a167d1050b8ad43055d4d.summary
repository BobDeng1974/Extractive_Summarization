a spurned boyfriend who posted naked pictures of his ex-girlfriend on the internet is thought to be the first person jailed for ‘ revenge porn ’ , it emerged yesterday			1
@entity7 , 21 , was sent intimate pictures by the woman during their three - year on - off relationship			1
but she went to police after he posted several of the images on social media sites , together with offensive comments , following the breakdown of their affair			2
jailed : @entity18 was sent a number of intimate photographs by the victim during an on - off relationship that lasted three years			1
he uploaded one of them to online messaging service @entity25 in august the case comes just weeks after justice secretary @entity28 vowed to clamp down on revenge porn			1
he announced it would become a criminal offence , with a maximum jail term of two years			0
jailing @entity7 for 12 weeks , district judge @entity33 said his actions were ‘ pernicious ’ and designed to cause ‘ maximum humiliation ’ to the victim , whose identity was protected by the court			1
‘ you should be thoroughly ashamed of this offence , ’ the judge said			0
‘ i regard this as despicable and a significant breach of trust			0
’ tough stance : the sentencing comes just weeks after the government promised to clamp down on ' revenge porn '			1
above , @entity18 on august 8 this year , @entity7 replaced his profile picture on the internet messaging service @entity25 with an explicit image of his ex , @entity48 was told			1
the victim , who lives in @entity54 , told police : ‘ it disgusted and really upset me			2
’ she had already contacted police over her ex-boyfriend ’s abusive behaviour			1
@entity7 was eventually prosecuted under the @entity59 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the x-rated images			1
he pleaded guilty to harassment and another charge of failing to answer police bail			1
@entity65 , prosecuting , said : ‘ she ( the victim ) called police to report that he had threatened to put explicit photographs of her on the internet			1
she accepted she sent them initially to him but they were for his eyes only			0
’ @entity75 , defending , said @entity7 agreed his behaviour was ‘ unacceptable ’			2
last month the government announced that the distribution of ‘ revenge porn ’ was to become a criminal offence as part of an amendment to the @entity83 , which is currently going through @entity84			2
at the time , mr @entity28 said : ‘ we want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side and will do everything we can to bring offenders to justice			0
’ @entity96 district crown prosecutor @entity95 said : ‘ prosecutors are now following guidance … that clarifies how we can use existing legislation to prosecute perpetrators of these intrusive offences			0
’ those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws			2
it will be made a specific offence , covering the sharing of images both online and offline , in the @entity83 , which is currently going through @entity84			0
it will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as @entity120 and @entity121 will be caught by the offence , as well as those that are shared via text message			0
images shared via email , on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught			0
victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet			1
many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the @entity137 , and requests to remove content are often ignored			0
in some cases , asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images			0
the move to clamp down on ' revenge porn ' came after 149 cases , the vast majority of them involving women victims , were reported over two and a half years			2
only six led to prosecutions			0
however , the new rules do not affect the consensual ' sexting ' of images by under - 18s			2
this is already illegal – but police can not monitor mobile photo messages .			0

@entity18 was sent naked photos by victim during three - year relationship
she contacted police when he threatened to post images after it ended
he *changed* profile picture on internet messaging service to explicit photo
@entity7 pleaded guilty to harassment and was jailed for 12 weeks
comes weeks after @entity175 promised *crackdown* on ' revenge porn '
