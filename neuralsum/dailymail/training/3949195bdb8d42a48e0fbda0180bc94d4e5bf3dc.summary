by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 09:23 est , 4 april 2012 as the country plunges into the depths of a record youth unemployment crisis - with one in four youngsters now out of work - you might expect any jobs would be snapped up within hours			1
but a landlady has condemned @entity10 ’s ‘ stay - in - bed ’ generation of youngsters after spending six months fruitlessly searching for trainee chef			1
despite one in six 16 to 24 - year - olds currently being part of the unenviable @entity17 tribe - short for not in education , employment or training - @entity20 , 53 , has been unable to fill the pub 's vacancies			1
@entity24 ethic : @entity26 and @entity27 are struggling to get many people even to turn up for an interview for a job in their kitchen she has set up five interviews every week on average , but said only half of applicants have turned up			1
and those offered a job , which pays the minimum wage , have failed to show up for work			1
now @entity26 and husband @entity0 , 55 , who run the @entity41 pub in @entity42 , near @entity43 , @entity44 , have criticised the culture of ‘ spoiling ’ youngsters with pocket money instead of instilling a basic work ethic in them			1
it comes 24 hours after deputy prime minister @entity50 launched the £ 1billion ‘ youth contract ’ scheme in a bid to create jobs for youngsters after figures revealed more than a million 16 to 24 - year - olds are without a job , more than at any time since records began in 1992			1
mrs @entity20 said : ‘ our pub is a fantastic place to work - it ’s a young hard working team and another youngster would fit in and enjoy working here			1
‘ but we are struggling to find that person to become an apprentice because of lack of reliability			0
i have to say it ’s not an easy job and it ’s not a doddle but it ’s one you can get a lot out of and hopefully have a whole career in			0
‘ we ’ve had about 30 people apply but barely half of those turn up for interviews			1
it just wastes my time as well waiting for them			0
help needed : @entity27 says when the job in the pub 's kitchen was offered to an applicant , they turned up late or not at all ‘ after a bit you ’re a bit cynical and just think they wo n’t turn up , so i wait 20 minutes and then i wo n’t wait any longer because i ’m too busy			2
‘ most of them just do n’t turn up , they ’re full of enthusiasm over the phone and then they do n’t bother			2
some of them you ask for a trial and they might start off okay but then they just let you down			0
‘ people come to work here then realise the shifts are unsociable hours			2
that ’s when they realise their friends are out doing other things whilst they are working			0
it does n’t help and they let us down			0
‘ all we want to do is give someone a chance but it ’s just finding that person			0
’ the post as a trainee chef would involve the chance to train on a local college course so the person would be a fully qualified chef at the end			0
the position includes food preparation , cooking , cleaning , learning to keep the books and at the beginning is a 30 hour week , with most mornings starting at rather leisurely 10am			0
mr and mrs @entity20 expected hoards of eager youngsters wanting to snap up the trainee chef job and advertised in local shops , the job centre , the pub itself and local colleges , last october			1
but despite youth unemployment being at an all - time high the couple had just 30 people apply for the position - with only half bothering to turn up for the interview			1
no takers : despite lots of advertising , pub landlords @entity0 and @entity20 have been unable to recruit any pot washers , bar staff or a kitchen apprentice one hopeful blamed his lack of bus fare for not being able to come while others just never even called			1
when the applicants were invited for trial weeks they would often just stop coming without warning			2
@entity26 thinks a lack of commitment to hard work and more of a focus on their social life has led to the record numbers of young people who are out of work across the country			2
mrs @entity20 added : ‘ since we first advertised the job in schools , colleges and the job centre , we ’ve had an average of about five interviews set up every week			1
i ’m lucky if two of the applicants turn up			1
‘ the people who have taken the job have been unreliable , claiming they ’ve got no bus fare and making excuses week after week			0
‘ some youngsters are only too keen to stay in bed on a work day because they have been enjoying themselves the night before and we ’ve allowed them to get away with it			1
‘ i think we spoil our children now			0
in our day we had to do paper rounds or milk rounds , you got yourself prepared for work			2
condemnation : publicans @entity26 and @entity27 who run the @entity185 pub in @entity42 , @entity43 , blame a something for nothing culture for their difficulties recruiting kitchen staff ‘ but whilst the world ’s changed due to safety worries , it does make work suddenly come as a bit of a shock			1
‘ i think a lot of youngsters go out at night and ca n’t be bothered in the morning			1
but it ’s not that early , it ’s a 10am start for us - a lot of jobs are a 7am or 8 am start			0
‘ it is unsociable hours and we are out of the way and it is a big commitment but it ’s a job			0
‘ i know they want to do both , going out and working , but they just ca n’t when it comes to the next day and getting up , they ’re not fit for work			2
‘ we want them by the end to be a fully qualified chef			0
it ’s like any job the money is n’t fantastic at the start but you work your way up , it ’s a career			2
‘ we ’re looking to employ someone who we can send to college			0
they ’d be doing @entity222 certificates to do the job professionally and long term			0
we ’re offering someone the chance of further education			0
’ minimum wages for apprentices start at £ 2.60 an hour between the aged of 16 and 19 or £ 3.68 hourly pay for employees aged between 16 and 17 and £ 4.98 for 18 to 20 year olds			0
over 21s can get a minimum of £ 6.08			0
on tuesday mr @entity50 said youth unemployment was akin to a ‘ ticking time bomb			1
’ his youth contract is designed to get young people ‘ earning or learning			2

just half of applicants bothered to turn up for interviews
@entity20 , 53 , blames a something for nothing culture for leaving youngsters with no work ethic
