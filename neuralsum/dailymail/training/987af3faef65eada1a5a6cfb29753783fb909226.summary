however , @entity0 are understood to have discussed a £ 100,000 offer ahead of the january transfer window to fend off their rivals			1
@entity0 manager @entity19 could be set to snatch non-league sensation @entity3 @entity5 chairman @entity20 said : ' it would be wrong of us to stand in his way if a good opportunity arises for him to move to a higher level			2
' the former @entity27 trainee has taken the @entity28 by storm since breaking into the first team last season scoring some vital and spectacular goals			0
talking to the @entity32 , @entity3 said : ' playing under pressure is good for me but at the same time i do n’t want to make any mistakes when the scouts are watching			2
' it ’s really important i stay disciplined and keep concentrating because that ’s helped me so far and i feel both the team and i have benefited			0
it ’s hard to believe some of the clubs i ’ve been linked with but it ’s obviously a massive thrill and exciting as well			0
@entity1 manager @entity44 is among those interested in the 18 - year - old @entity47 starlet ' it ’s a tough level to come in at as you ’re being kicked everywhere every week but that physical side of it is good as it toughens you up			1
