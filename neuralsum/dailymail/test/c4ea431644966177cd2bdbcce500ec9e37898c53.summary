surgeons are calling for the rules on laser eye surgery to be strengthened after an apparent rise in patients receiving substandard care			1
a private hospital in @entity7 says that increasing numbers of people are seeking its help after being given bad advice or poor treatment elsewhere			1
and it says it is now time for the industry to be ‘ taken to task ’			0
a leading private eye hospital is calling for tighter regulations on laser eye surgery after noting a rise in the number of people who have been given inaccurate information or poor care			1
up to 120,000 @entity24 have laser eye surgery each year to correct long and short - sightedness , and almost one in 20 of them suffer some sort of @entity29 operations are done privately , with patients paying up to £ 5,000 to have both eyes corrected			1
last year , the consumer group which ? warned that not all clinics are properly explaining the risks involved			0
regret : law graduate @entity37 law graduate @entity37 said that surgery to correct her short - sightedness left her in agony			1
she suffered from painfully dry eyes after she had the laser treatment , which was caused by damage to the nerves that stimulate tears			1
and in the years after the procedure , miss @entity37 said she had to apply eye drops every day to alleviate the pain , which in itself can bring on chronic eye inflammation			1
miss @entity37 had used contact lenses and glasses since she was at primary school but found they were a nuisance when playing sport			0
she had the £ 1,500 treatment as part of her 21st birthday present in 2010			0
but it was n’t the pain - free experience she was promised			2
she said : ‘ i ’m upset i was n’t warned enough at my initial consultation that anything like this could happen			0
i would have thought much harder about it had i known the risks			0
’ miss @entity37 , from @entity67 in @entity68 , suffered from poor night vision and ‘ floaters ’ in the years after she had the surgery			2
‘ the floaters are like clumps of black lines and dots , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’ve been reassured they ’re harmless , but they are incredibly annoying			0
’ floaters can occur as a result of a popular form of laser surgery in which a flap is cut into the surface of the cornea — the clear , domed part of the eyeball			2
poor night - time vision can occur if part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly			1
despite the side effects , the procedure did correct @entity93 ’ vision			0
its investigation found that one in three consultations by clinics offering the treatment was of poor quality			2
now , surgeons are speaking out			2
they say that despite the term ‘ laser eye surgery ’ , the procedure does n’t have to be done by a surgeon or even someone with specialist eye knowledge			1
instead , all that is required is that the person doing the operation is qualified as a doctor of some sort			2
dr @entity114 , an eye surgeon at the @entity115 , said the unit is treating more patients who have received unsatisfactory treatment elsewhere than five years ago			1
and other specialist clinics are seeing a similar rise			1
dr @entity114 added : ‘ at the moment , anybody who has a basic doctor ’s qualification could in theory go off and spend a few hours or a couple of days learning how to use the kit and set off giving treatment			0
’ @entity130 , the hospital ’s medical director , called for a compulsory register of practitioners that patients could use to find a suitably qualified surgeon			2
he said : ‘ laser eye surgeons are , at present , only required to be registered as doctors ; no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out a laser eye procedure			1
the @entity115 in @entity7 said laser eye surgeons are presently only required to be registered as doctors - and no specialist qualifications are legally required ‘ and with those who trained abroad , it ’s even more difficult to establish levels of expertise in specific treatments			1
this makes a central register all the more important , as it gives patients the tools to check exactly in whose hands they are putting their vision			0
‘ we have seen a rising number of people arriving at the @entity115 who have previously been given inaccurate information or poor care and we strongly believe that it is time for this industry to be taken to task			1
’ the @entity161 of @entity162 says complications occur in almost one in 20 cases			0
these include dry eyes and problems with night vision			0
it says that severe visual problems are ‘ very unusual ’ , but some patients require corneal surgery or hard contact lenses to restore satisfactory vision			0
it advises patients to quiz clinics about how often they perform the treatment and what their success rates are			0
a spokesman said that while in theory the operation could be done by someone who is registered as a doctor but does not have further qualifications , the likelihood of this happening is ‘ very , very negligible ’			1
she added that the organisation is working with the @entity191 to improve standards .			0

warning comes from the @entity115 in @entity7
comes after rise in patients previously given poor information or care
@entity202 laser eye surgeons are presently only required to be registered as doctors - and no specialist qualifications are legally required
