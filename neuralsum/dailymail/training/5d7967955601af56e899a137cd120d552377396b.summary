by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 17:41 est , 9 september 2013 anti-sleaze campaigners claimed a victory for parents yesterday as watchdogs finally rebuked @entity5 for showing nudity before the watershed on one of its flagship reality shows			1
in a landmark judgment , media regulator @entity11 found the broadcaster broke official rules by showing a burlesque dancer ’s naked bottom before the 9pm cut - off			1
it said @entity5 had crossed a ‘ clear line ’ by showing dancer @entity18 stripping to just a feather boa and a necklace during an episode of @entity23 ’s got more talent			1
it is the first time @entity11 has found that @entity23 ’s @entity22 or @entity37 has breached its code on what can be aired before the watershed			1
the decision follows years of criticism of its ‘ toothless ’ regulation of sexualised content and was welcomed as a clear warning to @entity5 to tone down the content of its flagship entertainment shows			2
last year , @entity11 decided a similar burlesque routine by @entity51 dancer @entity50 was on the ‘ margins of acceptability ’ , while a series of raunchy performances on the @entity37 have failed to draw clear condemnation			2
as the routine progressed , presenter @entity57 was seen egging her on from the side of the stage the bare necessities : as the singer 's zip went lower , the denouement of her act became clear lower : the @entity23 's @entity22 audience whooped with delight as the dancer 's dress fell to the floor covered by @entity75 , this is the shot that angered regulator @entity11 , who said it was unsuitable for children now campaigners have urged the watchdog to fine broadcasters who allow offensive language , violence and sex before the watershed			1
@entity89 of lobby group @entity90 , said she was delighted by the ruling , adding : ‘ @entity11 put out guidance on this well over a year ago , but broadcasters simply ignored it			2
hopefully this decision will finally make them change their ways			0
‘ it is a victory for parents who are concerned about what their children are being exposed to before the watershed			0
finally we have a clear signal that it has got to stop			0
‘ i want @entity11 to show its teeth by hitting broadcasters where it hurts			2
i want to see it backing up its words with real sanctions			0
’ currently @entity11 does not have the power to impose fines			2
nevertheless yesterday ’s ruling will be seen by @entity5 as a serious rebuke			0
scarlet cuffs – whose real name is @entity115 – first appeared on @entity23 ’s got more talent on april 13			0
the @entity118 spin - off programme shows footage and auditions not aired in the main @entity51 competition			0
aired at 8.35pm , the episode showed miss @entity123 , 31 , appear on stage in a sequinned dress before singing @entity126 hit @entity127 to judges @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
she slowly unzipped her dress before stripping completely , using only a feather boa to cover what remained of her modesty before turning and wiggling her naked bottom to the audience			0
in its judgment yesterday , @entity11 said that , although a series of one and two - second shots of miss @entity123 ’s bottom were pixelated , the measure was ‘ of limited effectiveness ’ and ‘ did not sufficiently obscure the performer ’s naked buttocks ’			1
judges @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity128 were startled by the striptease judges @entity131 and @entity132 were astonished when @entity112 ' dress fell to the floor it added : ‘ the frequency and detail of these images in context of a striptease in a burlesque act meant that on balance they were not suitable for children			1
’ the episode was repeated three times , at 5.30pm the following day and at 6.30am and 1.30pm on april 17			0
@entity11 said the scenes were seen by a ‘ significant child audience ’ and concluded the episode breached rule 1.3 of its code , which states : ‘ children must … be protected by appropriate scheduling from material that is unsuitable			0
’ earlier this year , @entity11 decided not to investigate @entity23 ’s @entity22 after a risqué performance by @entity172 drew complaints			1
in april last year , it did investigate a routine by @entity51 dancer @entity50 , which was aired at 8pm			0
but , despite the fact she partially revealed her buttocks , it decided the act did not break any rules			0
and in 2011 , @entity11 was criticised for clearing @entity5 ’s other flagship reality show @entity37 over lewd performances by both @entity182 and @entity183			1
@entity184 of @entity11 said : ‘ there is a clear line in terms of what it is acceptable to broadcast before the 9pm watershed			2
a striptease act broadcast at times when a significant number of children were likely to be watching crossed this line			0
’ an @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we note @entity11 ’s decision			1
’ @entity112 is a singer and burlesque artist who describes her stripping routine as ' sing and fling ' show 's over : the performer was brought a coat so she could cover up before the judges addressed her			1

@entity112 stripped while singing @entity208 for the judges
shocked @entity128 , @entity132 , @entity130 and @entity131
@entity11 says showing a bare bottom before 9pm broke the rules
@entity5 says they pixellated her bottom before showing on @entity23 's @entity22
