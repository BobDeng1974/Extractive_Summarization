@entity2 , 24 , was five months pregnant with her first child when her waters broke on may 17 last year			1
she went to hospital and two days later developed a serious infection and was sweaty with a fluctuating temperature , key symptoms of septic shock			1
she told staff at @entity20 , @entity21 , she was in pain on the morning of may 19 , apparently indicating her contractions had started early			1
at 3.15pm on may 19 , when an utlrasound scan showed miss @entity2 ’s baby boy was dying , doctors chose to induce the birth			1
but her family claim staff delayed inducing the labour and did not act quickly enough over signs that miss @entity2 had a severe infection			1
it was not until 9.28pm that evening – more than six hours after the scan – that she gave birth to the stillborn boy			0
she was taken straight to intensive care and placed on a ventilator , but died of multiple organ failure at 9.10am the next day with her family at her bedside			1
her distraught parents @entity40 , 59 , and @entity41 , 53 , have now hired solicitors to investigate the hospital , claiming that neither clinicians or nurses knew what to do and disagreed about treatment			1
they allege that staff were negligent and that this led to the death of their daughter and her child , which she was expecting with boyfriend @entity55			2
miss @entity2 had already been into hospital a month before her death to have a procedure which would prevent her going into premature labour , but it was unsuccessful			1
speaking after an inquest was opened into her death , her father , 59 , said : ‘ how can it be that a healthy , young pregnant woman can go into hospital and for neither she nor her baby to see the light of day again ? ' death : an ultrasound image of the baby boy , who was stillborn in may last year he described how miss @entity2 called him on the day she went into hospital and told him that things did not look good but he should stay at home			1
at 1.30am , she called again and said “ you better get here fast ” ’ ‘ when i saw @entity2 in the @entity80 my first words were " my god , what have they done to her			1
" i just could n’t understand what had happened			0
' we were all talking to @entity2 ; trying to encourage her to stay with us but she just was n’t responding			2
seeing your daughter like that is absolutely devastating			0
' i just could n’t understand what had happened			0
we were all talking to @entity2 , trying to encourage her to stay with us but she just was n’t responding			2
seeing your daughter like that is absolutely devastating			0
‘ the look on the faces of the staff told me how grave the situation had become			0
all we could do was watched as she drifted away from us and then , that morning , she was gone			0
’ the father of @entity97 , pictured , said : ' my family and i are still suffering			0
all summer i tried to bottle it up ' mr @entity97 , a banker from @entity102 , @entity103 , has not worked since july last year after he was diagnosed with depression over his daughter 's death , his solicitor said			0
he said he believes staff could have done far more to save miss @entity2 and his grandchild			1
‘ it was as if the junior staff were left alone to deal with it , ’ he said			0
‘ we witnessed a complete lack of leadership and staff appeared unwilling to step in to take responsibility for @entity2 ’s treatment			1
‘ it felt like someone had pulled the rug from under us			0
@entity2 went into hospital a healthy girl and look what they did to her			2
‘ two lives were lost that day			2
my family and i are still suffering and i will never let it go until our daughter and her baby receive justice			0
' @entity131 , representing the family , said an internal report by the hospital had already identified failings			0
solicitor @entity136 said : ' @entity137 has produced a @entity138 which recognises a number of failings in the care provided to @entity2 - including the failure of the obstetric team to respond with sufficient urgency to the seriousness of @entity2 ’s condition			2
‘ although it was apparent that the doctors and nurses were faced with a busy maternity ward that day , they did not know how to prioritise the patients and there was little involvement from the consultant until it was too late			0
claim : miss @entity2 died in may last year at @entity20 , @entity21			1
her family claim staff were negligent miss @entity2 , a 24 - year - old hairdresser , died of multiple organ failure at @entity20 in @entity21 , pictured ' the window of time when @entity2 ’s life might have been saved was lost and her family are now living with the consequences			1
' the very least they deserve is absolute clarity about what happened on that fatal day in may , and to be reassured steps are taken to prevent the senseless loss of such young lives again in the future			2
' an inquest was opened and adjourned on tuesday and a full hearing will be held later			0
a spokesman for @entity173 said it was not appropriate to comment until the conclusion of the inquest .			0

@entity2 , 24 , developed a severe infection at five months ' pregnancy
the hairdresser was moved onto a ventilator but died the next morning
