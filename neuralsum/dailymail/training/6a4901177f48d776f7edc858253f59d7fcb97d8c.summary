by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 19:14 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 28 november 2013 the comet which astronomers had been watching with great interest because it was passing so close to the sun on thursday appears to have been destroyed			1
@entity7 , which had been branded the ' comet of the century , ' was making its closest approach to the sun , skimming about 730,000 miles above its surface , when it disappeared from the view of space telescopes			1
' @entity7 probably has not survived this journey , ' @entity15 with the @entity17 @entity16 and the @entity19 @entity18 told a @entity19 @entity20 on thursday			1
observers had been hoping that @entity7 would survive its @entity34 close encounter with the sun and emerge to put on a big sky show in december			1
' we have never seen a comet like this , ' @entity16 astrophysicist @entity15 had said during a @entity19 news conference on tuesday			0
' it has been behaving strangely			0
' according to @entity45 scientist @entity44 , even if the comet has died there is a good chance that people on @entity48 will get an interesting cosmic show			0
the comet 's remnants could paint the sky with a wide swath of green in the @entity55			2
@entity7 , which had been branded the ' comet of the century , ' was making its closest approach to the sun , skimming about 730,000 miles above its surface , when it disappeared from the view of space telescopes here , @entity7 enters the field of view of the @entity27 and @entity19 's @entity26 on november 27			1
in this picture , called a coronagraph , the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible			0
the comet is seen in the lower right and a giant cloud of solar material , called a coronal mass ejection is seen billowing out under the sun the comet - two - thirds of a mile wide - is made up of loosely packed ice and dirt , essentially a dirty snowball			2
it is a ' dinosaur bone , ' from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago , @entity44 said			0
it has been in ' deep freeze ' for billions of years in the oort cloud , a vast area of comets and debris that never formed into planets that 's between 450 billion and 9 trillion miles from the sun , he said			2
the comet is racing around the sun , pulled close by our star 's massive gravity , which can also break apart the dirty icy core			1
@entity7 was first spotted by a @entity98 telescope in september last year			0
while many comets come out of the @entity101 cloud and return after a long trip through the solar system and many comets graze by the sun , this is the first one that astronomers have watched that is from the @entity101 cloud and is skimming the sun. @entity44 said @entity7 could behave just like last year 's @entity114 , which fell apart a couple days after passing by the sun. its remnants were visible like ' a beautiful paintbrush swath in the sky ' in the @entity119 , he said			1
@entity7 was discovered by two amateur @entity98 astronomers in 2012 and will come within 730,000 miles of the @entity121 today appearance : @entity7 entered the view of @entity19 's @entity124 on nov. 21 , 2013 , where it can be seen with @entity48 , @entity126 and comet @entity128 unlike many blue comets , @entity7 has been more lime - green because it does n't seem to have as much carbon monoxide as other comets , @entity44 said			1
if the comet does make it around the sun intact and returns past @entity48 , the @entity55 should get good naked - eye views just before sunrise and just after sunset in the first couple weeks of december , @entity44 said			1
but this probably wo n't be as bright and visible as 1997 's @entity140 , said @entity141 of the @entity142 in @entity143			0
over the last few weeks , the reports were n't good for @entity7 's survival			2
on monday , astronomers at @entity147 ' were a little bit worried and depressed ' because the comet produced a classic sign of flaming out , @entity44 said from the @entity151 telescope			0
earlier , astronomers thought it may have broken up			0
then on tuesday , a solar telescope spotted the comet and it was growing brighter just as it should have			0
' it 's a wild ride , this comet , ' @entity44 said			0
' the reports of @entity7 's demise have been greatly exaggerated for the last month or two and @entity7 continues to surprise us			2
' a composite image from the @entity164 's @entity163 telescope in @entity165 shows @entity7 streaking toward the sun on nov. 15			1
the image combines four different 30 - second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths the comet , top right , has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout december and january			1
it could be the brightest for 100 years the comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail			0

@entity7 disappeared from the view of space telescopes on thursday when it was skimming about 730,000 miles above the sun 's surface
experts said it appears @entity7 - *dubbed* ' comet of the century ' - broke up into chunks and the sun evaporated it
observers had hoped @entity7 would survive its @entity34 close encounter with the sun and emerge to put on a big sky show in december
