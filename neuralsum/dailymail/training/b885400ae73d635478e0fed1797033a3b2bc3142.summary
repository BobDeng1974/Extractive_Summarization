by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 24 march 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 25 march 2013 the sight of @entity3 and @entity4 getting out to loose , almost reckless shots when survival was the height of ambition said everything about the sorry state @entity11 found themselves in at the end of a test series they should have dominated			1
@entity11 ’s most prolific and single - minded batsmen are usually perfect for a crisis			1
but their departures on the fourth evening of this final , decisive test in the face of a mountainous target looked to have made this a case of one survival battle too many			0
@entity11 went into the final day at @entity25 perilously placed at 90 for four			1
they were chasing a nominal 481 for victory but needing a rescue act beyond even those that saw them draw tests against the odds in recent times at @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and , in this series , @entity38			0
batting coach @entity39 , who has pretty much seen it all , admitted that @entity11 may have underestimated @entity41			2
‘ i think it ’s a great reality check that you ca n’t take any team lightly and ca n’t play people on what it says in the rankings , or on a piece of paper , ’ said @entity39 after the fourth day			2
‘ you have to play good cricket to compete and in two of the three matches so far , @entity41 have been in the ascendancy			0
‘ our performance has not been up to the standards we ’ve produced on a consistent basis so we ’ll have to look at that , yes			0
but i would n’t say we took them lightly after the first match , when @entity41 dominated the game			0
they ’ve outbowled and outbatted us so far			0
’ the big one : @entity11 captain @entity4 leaves the field after scoring 43 during day four of the third test close catchers : @entity4 bats as his @entity70 counterpart @entity69 deploys his men around the bat bad @entity3 : @entity11 's @entity73 traipses off after being caught behind chasing a wide one in the evening session @entity75 's nicked one : @entity11 's @entity77 ( right ) heads for the pavilion after being caught by @entity41 's wicketkeeper @entity79 for two what makes this so hard to take is that @entity41 , the world ’s eighth - ranked team , lost seven of their eight @entity31 prior to this series and endured an internal crisis over @entity89 ’s removal as captain which was every bit as damaging as the @entity94 affair			1
yet they went into the final day as hot favourites to wrap up only their fourth test series triumph over @entity11 and their first against anybody other than @entity99 and @entity100 since 2006 , when they defeated @entity102			1
the first session of day four summed up this test and the whole sorry series for @entity11			1
they lacked ideas , imagination and , frankly , leadership as @entity41 moved into a position from which history tells you they could not possibly lose this @entity104			0
so bad were @entity11 before lunch that @entity41 , who began the day at 35 for three and under a smidgen of pressure , were able to score freely and aggressively to rack up 141 in the session for the loss of @entity121			1
it was witless , hopeless cricket from @entity11 , notable for the petulance of @entity125 in berating his fielders and the apparent lack of anything resembling tactical nous			2
job well done : @entity69 applauds his team - mates at the close of a very successful day for the hosts double up : @entity134 is applauded off on the day he completed his second century of the test match the biggest recipient of @entity11 ’s largesse was @entity134 , a cricketing journeyman who was expected to be little more than a walking wicket in this series after a four - year absence from the five - day game			1
instead , he became only the fourth @entity142 , after @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , to score two centuries in the same test			0
@entity41 started the fourth day with a lead of 274 but by the time @entity134 and @entity69 , with yet another half - century , had completed their stand of 117 in only 16.5 overs , the @entity104 was out of @entity11 ’s reach barring a recovery of historic proportions			1
@entity155 , who had started the day by taking @entity121 ’s wicket thanks to an excellent catch from @entity158 and bowled four maidens on the trot , was then destroyed to the tune of 52 runs in his next five overs			1
@entity34 : @entity134 celebrates his mean feat with a simple wave of the bat to the sparse @entity168 crowd proud parents : @entity170 and @entity171 watch their son @entity172 score a century on day four @entity134 , vulnerable outside off stump , was allowed to indulge his love of the leg side , seemingly dispatching @entity155 over the short , straight boundary at will			2
it was when @entity134 brought up his hundred with another straight six , off @entity125 , that the game was up			0
@entity69 , a combative , purposeful cricketer who has vindicated his controversial elevation above @entity89 by out - captaining @entity4 , delayed his declaration possibly longer than necessary and set @entity11 481 to win			1
it was quickly made worse when @entity77 , who came into this match with successive centuries , fell cheaply for the second time in the match			0
and it could have been made terminal had @entity4 not been dropped by diving wicketkeeper @entity79 on one			2
down and out : @entity188 , @entity69 and @entity189 celebrate taking @entity4 's wicket it looked likely to be costly but when @entity3 was out , uncharacteristically driving at a wide one from @entity192 , and @entity4 — showing unnecessary attacking intent — was snaffled by a smart @entity121 catch , @entity11 were in big trouble			1
the departure of the @entity197 , nightwatchman @entity198 , to what became the final ball of the day completed @entity11 ’s misery			2
it is time for some soul - searching before the return series in @entity11 in may and then 10 back - to - back @entity31			1
‘ it ’s not the sort of conclusion to the winter we wanted , ’ admitted @entity39			0
‘ we wanted to finish strongly going into a big summer and build on the test cricket we played in @entity212			0
‘ we ’ve had some good performances but here we ’ve not found that form so we ’ve got to be disappointed			0
we ca n’t be happy with the way we ’ve played			0
’ top effort : @entity158 pouches @entity121 's skier ( left ) and celebrates with his team - mates ( right ) @entity219 @entity11 came into this series with a much - envied bowling unit			1
but while @entity223 have been off the pace , the @entity41 underdogs have shown plenty of bite			0
all four of @entity11 ’s main bowlers have underperformed , as the statistics show , while their @entity232 opponents , with the exception of @entity230 , have all improved their career statistics .			2

@entity11 skipper follows toss error with day - four *shocker*
@entity239 claim prize *scalps* of @entity4 and @entity3 despite both making starts
hosts need six wickets to claim only their fourth series win over @entity11
@entity158 remains last hope for *toiling* *tourists* after @entity250 century
