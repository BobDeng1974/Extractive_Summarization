@entity0 is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits @entity3 's misfiring team at @entity4			1
the coach has come in for fierce criticism during another @entity8 campaign of grinding , mid-table mediocrity , but according to two members of the last @entity14 team to win a championship match in @entity16 , exactly a decade ago , the problems run deeper than the man in charge			1
their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the @entity24 league which has stalled the development of home - grown talent – and the death of @entity29 flair			1
@entity0 full back @entity30 ( left ) , who was born in @entity31 , makes a break against @entity33 in @entity34 @entity36 flanker @entity35 ( centre ) is another @entity39 - born player in @entity0 's ranks @entity42 winger @entity41 ( right ) was born in @entity43 but now represents @entity44 @entity45 was snapped up by @entity0 after the @entity39 scrum half qualified on residency grounds @entity0 coach @entity3 has come in for strong criticism following another mediocre campaign @entity52 v @entity0 - extended highlights 72 per cent : @entity54 players in @entity56 match day squads so far this season			1
70 per cent : @entity54 players in 2014 @entity56 final match day squads			1
71 per cent : @entity54 players in @entity56 sides for last round of @entity63			1
45 per cent : @entity29 players in @entity24 squads , according to @entity29 study			2
46 per cent : @entity29 players in 2014 top 14 final match day squads			1
62 per cent : @entity29 players in top 14 sides for last round of @entity63			1
there is still a mathematical chance that @entity44 can win the title this weekend , but that is pie in the sky and can not disguise their chronic limitations			2
@entity79 , the goal - kicking hero of @entity0 's 18 - 17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005 , describes it as a ' bad time for our rugby ' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue			1
' to me , the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the @entity24 and all the good young @entity29 players do n't play enough , ' said the former @entity96 scrum - half			1
' the clubs prefer buying a @entity39 player , or a @entity100 player or an @entity102 player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that			0
the young players do n't play and that is not good			1
' when young players arrive in the @entity29 team , they do n't have enough experience of the high level			1
a few years ago , you had to be good for one or two years for your club , before you could be picked for @entity0			1
now you just have to do one good move in a match			0
former @entity0 scrum half @entity79 fires out a pass during his side 's clash against @entity119 in 2004 @entity79 's sublime goal - kicking performance secured @entity0 's last victory at @entity4 back in 2005 ' @entity123 at @entity0 and against @entity124 in @entity125 , we were not very far from winning those games , but we are missing the experience that is needed			1
if we did n't have so many foreign players in our league , the players would have more experience and we could win those games			1
' @entity133 was another stalwart of the @entity0 team that stormed the @entity4 barricades 10 years ago			1
the @entity137 and @entity138 flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country , adding : ' the politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level			0
@entity54 rugby organises things to give their national players priority			2
' during my time at @entity96 , i played with @entity150 , who won the @entity151 with @entity152			0
these kind of players showed me how to improve			2
to be in contact with them is important , but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters			0
we 've got a lot of talented players like @entity163 and @entity164			2
but @entity163 needs the time to express his talent			2
i do n't know why he has n't had the time			0
' former @entity0 flanker @entity133 ( right ) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the @entity24 @entity41 once captain of the @entity43 schoolboys team , the powerful winger moved to @entity0 after @entity42 set up an academy in the @entity174			1
he signed with the @entity24 club in 2011 and made his @entity0 debut two years later			2
@entity45 the scrum - half was snapped up by @entity44 as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three - year residency rule			2
he was tipped as a @entity31 star following his time with the @entity182 but was overlooked by @entity31 coach @entity183			2
@entity35 despite being born and raised in @entity185 , @entity31 , the flanker made his rugby debut in @entity187			0
he joined the @entity188 on the @entity189 and was offered a deal with the @entity191 but opted for a move to @entity36			0
@entity30 born in @entity194 , @entity31 , the full back came through the @entity182 academy and represented the @entity31 at @entity197 level			0
he signed for @entity198 in 2008 before moving to @entity199 and was granted a @entity29 passport last year			0
the decline of the renowned @entity29 flair has been in evidence at test and club level for several years now			0
a nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled ' try from the end of the earth ' in @entity211 in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic , @entity213 reliance on brute force			0
asked if his country have tried too hard to play like @entity119 , @entity79 said : ' yes , yes			1
we have lost our @entity29 rugby a little bit , because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the @entity29 clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing			1
we must try to keep the @entity29 flair , but i think we have lost that a bit			0
' it is in our dna to play intuitive rugby			0
we do n't have the best organisation and the best game - plans in the world , but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere			0
but we must be open - minded and free to play this rugby , and at the moment i think we 're not free			0
' @entity133 echoed his former team - mate , adding : ' @entity119 has taken parts of the @entity29 to add that x-factor to their game – guys like @entity243 – who are n't just about kicking but can spot the gap			1
' @entity29 rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things , but it 's not always been effective			0
we want players to practise weights more than passing , but we need a more holistic approach			0
the flair comes with confidence and trust			0
you need panache , enjoyment and excitement ; sometimes that 's been missing			0
' what has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture			0
the @entity267 rivalry stirs @entity29 blood as much as it ever did			0
an admiration for those who wear the @entity271 is temporarily shelved at kick - off time			0
' we like @entity54 rugby , but we hate them just for 80 minutes ! ' said @entity79 , who spent a season at @entity277			2
' they are very good players , they are very well organised , they have a very good game - plan and we respect them , but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle			2
@entity133 believes players such as @entity163 ( left ) and @entity164 are hindered by the current system ' of course , it is the biggest game for us			1
it is historic and it is always special			0
it is the last game this year and @entity119 can still win the @entity8			1
for us , we will be more scared before the game than last week or against @entity123 at home , but i 'm hoping we can do something special			0
' that is certainly what @entity79 did in 2005			1
it was his special goal - kicking that helped @entity0 rally from a 17 - 6 half - time deficit to win 18 - 17			1
as it turns out , he was assisted with his match - winning efforts by an @entity54 , whose identity remains a secret			0
' it was crazy because , in the captain 's run training session the day before the game , my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game , ' he said			1
' but in the game , i think one kick hit the post but the rest were good			0
@entity316 - born prop @entity315 ( right ) is another foreign player that is part of the @entity0 squad ' i broke my kicking tee in the captain 's run training session and i had to ask a friend living in @entity16 where i could buy a tee , because i wanted the same one			1
he said the only shop around was at @entity4 , so he went to buy my tee for the game there , but nobody knew it ! i will not tell you the name of the friend , but he is @entity54 ! ' @entity0 surely wo n't be short of a tee or two this time , but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the @entity54 capital			1
but @entity79 has n't abandoned all hope			2
' when people think we are no good , that is when @entity0 do something , ' he said – ominously for the home side			2
' on paper , we would say @entity119 will beat us easily , because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now			2
but with @entity29 rugby , we never know			0

@entity119 face @entity0 in the final round of the @entity8 on *saturday*
@entity0 coach @entity3 has been heavily criticised following another *disappointing* @entity8 campaign
@entity79 concerned by high number of foreign players in top 14 league
@entity79 's goal - kicking secured @entity0 a 18 - 17 win at @entity4 in 2005
it was @entity0 's last victory at @entity362
@entity133 believes @entity0 are not developing enough young talent
