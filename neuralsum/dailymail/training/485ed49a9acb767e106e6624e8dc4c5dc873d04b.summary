support : @entity1 signalled his backing for @entity4 food after previously being sceptical about its use @entity1 has given the clearest signal yet that the government wants to see controversial genetically - modified crops grown across the country			1
the prime minister told a conference of entrepreneurs that @entity14 needs to take a ‘ really good look again ’ at its policy on @entity4 food if it is to prove it is a ‘ pro-science ’ country			1
the intervention from mr @entity1 that he wants to see a @entity4 free - for - all across the @entity14 will alarm those who deride genetic modification as ‘ @entity21 ’			2
it emerged earlier this week that ministers are to push the @entity24 to relax restrictions on the cultivation of @entity4 crops for human consumption			1
but it is the first time that the prime minister has spoken up in favour of the idea			2
in opposition he was seen as being sceptical of @entity4 crops			1
advocates argue that @entity4 techniques increase crop yields , avoid the need for pesticides , and could be essential in assuring @entity14 's future food security			2
however , any relaxation of current restrictions will be in the teeth of much opposition			0
a survey by @entity46 out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology , while 35 per cent opposed it			0
mr @entity1 made the comments as he addressed an audience of scientists and business leaders in @entity53 at an innovation summit linked to the @entity14 's leadership of the @entity57 group of the world 's richest nations			0
he said : ‘ we need to make sure we are a very pro-science country			0
i think there are one or two subjects there we need to take on			0
i think it 's time we had a really good look again at @entity4 food and all of that			1
‘ i think we need to be open to be open to arguments from science			0
’ the government is reported to be ready to call for @entity24 restrictions on cultivation of the crops for human consumption to be relaxed			1
the coalition has allowed small - scale cultivation trials for @entity4 food but widespread use is effectively banned			1
some @entity4 products are contained in imported foods , but most supermarkets have banned the ingredients from their own - brand products because of public unease about the material			2
the prime minister was addressing an audience of scientists and business leaders in @entity53 at an innovation summit linked to the @entity14 's leadership of the @entity57 group of the world 's richest nations genetically improved ? minsters believe @entity4 crops could ' make agriculture more efficient ' and help eradicate diseases such as dieback in the @entity14 earlier this week , science minister @entity99 supported calls for controls on @entity4 crops to be weakened to make it easier for @entity14 ’s farmers to grow them			1
' we believe that @entity4 crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable , by , for example , reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels , ' he said			1
a @entity112 analysis of 130 research projects carried out by 500 groups over 25 years concluded in 2010 that there is ' no scientific evidence associating genetically - modified organisms with higher risks for the environment or food and feed safety than conventional plants or organisms '			2
but opponents of @entity4 crops argue that it is far too early to conclude that the technique is safe – including many farmers , with a quarter of those surveyed saying they would not cultivate them under any circumstances			1
they are concerned that @entity4 crops could foster stronger pests , diseases and weeds that evolve to adapt to engineered plants			1
trials : attempts to grow genetically - modified crops have frequently been disrupted by protesters mr @entity1 also used the innovation event to launch a prize fund , with £ 1million of taxpayers ' money , to encourage revolutionary new ideas aimed at solving the world 's biggest problem			0
he said the modern version of the @entity147 would be a ‘ @entity14 's @entity148 ’ for innovators			0
‘ there are so many problems in our world that need that amazing solution , whether it is a cure for dementia , solving the problem of diabetes , having a flight from @entity14 to @entity160 that 's carbon free , ’ he said			0
‘ let 's challenge the public and challenge the scientists for which is the great problem we want to crack			0
‘ i 'm thinking of something - @entity14 's @entity148 , you know , you switch on the tv and you watch the dog jumping over the pole , or whatever it is			0
let 's actually get the nation engaged on what the biggest problems are in science and in our lives that we need to crack , with a multi-million pound prize to then help us do that			0

prime minister signals *u-turn* on @entity4 food to help feed the world
government is calling for @entity24 controls on new @entity4 crops to be relaxed
but *majority* of consumers want more *information* on impact of @entity4 crops
much of the meat , milk and eggs in stores come from *animals* fed a @entity4 diet
