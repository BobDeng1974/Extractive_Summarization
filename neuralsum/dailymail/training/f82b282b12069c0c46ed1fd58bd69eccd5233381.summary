in a recording of the phone call , the man can be heard telling emergency staff he is upset over his hamburger , demanding to be transferred to a @entity11 police station			2
during the nearly two - and - a - half minute conversation , the man argues with the call handler for telling him that his situation is not an emergency - and finishes off my swearing down the phone , scroll down to listen to the call @entity20 : the man phoned 999 from a location in @entity11 from @entity3 's where he was angry about his hamburger @entity24 have shamed the nuisance caller by releasing audio footage of the phone conversation today			1
during the two minute 17 second clip the man can be heard asking the emergency call operator to put him through to @entity31 in @entity11			2
after a lengthy argument with the operator over his refusal to ‘ do him a favour ’ and transfer him to the ‘ cop shop ’ , the rambling caller eventually reveals the true nature of his emergency			0
he can be heard saying : ‘ i am at @entity41 , i ’m asking for ingredients on the meal i ’m eating			2
’ the 999 call handler then interjects and says : ‘ this is not a 999 emergency			1
’ before the man replies ‘ yes it is though			0
’ the operator tells the man : ‘ you needing to get ingredients in the things you are eating in @entity41 is not an emergency			2
’ at this point the message seemingly gets through to the caller and he replies : ‘ is it not ? @entity57			0
’ the man then ends the conversation with an expletive , before the patient operator says : ‘ do n’t speak to me like that , please			0

hangry about un-happy meal : the man was upset over not being able to get the full list of ingredients for the hamburger he had purchased at @entity41 , demanding to speak to a @entity11 police station ‘ of these , some 10 to 20 per cent are not police matters and around 50 per cent are non-emergency calls where contact is appropriate via the 101 number			2
‘ as well as the bizarre calls police also receive deliberate hoax calls which take up vital time			0
‘ it ’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth			0
‘ each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but , if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency , then a minute is a very long time to wait			2
‘ i can not stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only , for guidance this is defined as : a crime is in progress , someone suspected of a crime is nearby , when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened			0
‘ we do not want to discourage people from contacting the police so for any other reason call 101			0
