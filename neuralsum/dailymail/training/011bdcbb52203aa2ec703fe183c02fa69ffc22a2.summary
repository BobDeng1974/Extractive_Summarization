exposure to @entity3 , the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , can increase the addictive properties of nicotine young people who smoke cannabis are also more likely to become addicted to cigarettes - increasing their risk of heart disease and lung cancer			1
exposure to @entity3 ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) , the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , can increase the addictive properties of nicotine , a study shows			1
the research , published online in the journal @entity19 , suggests previous cannabis use may make people more vulnerable to nicotine dependence and tobacco related diseases			0
cigarettes are often considered a ' gateway ' to other drugs , but there is now evidence to show the reverse can be true - the use of other drugs can lead to nicotine addiction			1
so dr @entity34 , of the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and colleagues tested whether exposing rats to @entity3 would make them more likely to self administer nicotine			2
for three days , one group was given twice daily injections of the chemical while another received an equivalent dose of an inactive placebo			0
beginning a week after their final jab , the rats were trained to work for intravenous injections of nicotine			0
those previously given @entity3 were far more likely to self - administer nicotine than the others , the researchers found			2
in addition , the @entity3 - exposed rats were prepared to work much harder to obtain nicotine than the control group , suggesting the value of nicotine was far greater after @entity3 exposure			1
dr @entity34 said : ' this finding indicates @entity3 - exposed rats placed a higher value on nicotine and devoted more time and energy to acquiring the drug			2
' cigarettes are often considered a ' gateway ' to other drugs such as marijuana ( pictured ) , but there is now evidence to show the reverse can be true although there are many factors that may contribute to a progression from marijuana use to tobacco dependence , the research suggests lasting effects of @entity3 may make marijuana users more susceptible to the addictive effects of tobacco			1
dr @entity34 said : ' tobacco is considered a gateway drug because its use tends to precede the use of other drugs			2
' however , there is epidemiological evidence that cannabis use develops prior to tobacco use in a substantial number of cases , and cannabis use by teenagers increases the likelihood of developing tobacco dependence when they reach young adulthood			0
' while there is also evidence genetic , social and environmental factors encourage the co-use of cannabis and tobacco , findings that cannabis use sometimes precedes regular tobacco use raise the possibility @entity3 exposure might increase susceptibility to nicotine addiction			1
' he added : ' it is estimated cigarette smoking will kill half of all lifetime users			0
in this context , an increased risk of tobacco dependence might be the most important health consequence of cannabis use			0
' previous research involving 2,500 young people in @entity129 found those who smoked cannabis daily for at least a month were four times more likely to become addicted to nicotine by the time they reached their 20s .			0
