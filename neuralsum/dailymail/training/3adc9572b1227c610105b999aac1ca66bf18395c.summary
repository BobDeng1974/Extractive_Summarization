exhausted : both battle - worn animals appear to have little energy left after fighting for an hour in the national park in @entity26 clinging on : the lion digs his claws into the buffalo 's face as he attempts to pull the animal downwards to deliver a killer bite ' the same process continued for about an hour until both animals were completely spent			1
