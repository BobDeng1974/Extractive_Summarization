@entity0 could have had the blockbuster fight he craves against @entity2 instead of treading water against @entity4 , if only his promoter had minded his words			1
now that @entity7 – potentially at @entity8 – may never take place			2
so says @entity2 's father @entity10 as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised @entity12 as his opponent in @entity14 on the same night when @entity0 will be defending his world welterweight title against @entity4 at @entity17 's @entity16 on may 20 promoter @entity18 ( centre ) stands behind @entity0 ( left ) and @entity4 at the @entity16 @entity2 celebrates his victory over @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23 last year @entity24 , who also supervises affairs , says : ' @entity0 could have had his chance against @entity2 right now if @entity18 had toned it down			1
but instead of being patient he 's been so disrespectful			2
' if he carries on like that the @entity0 fight will not take place			1
he keeps shouting about how much the fight is worth but i do n't care about the money			0
for @entity2 it 's more about the big fights and his status in boxing			1
' @entity2 's told @entity0 he will be happy to box him in the next year but @entity18 's jeopardising that			1
he carries on calling us out and insulting us			0
any more of that and it will be all over			0
' @entity0 has said plenty , too			2
but we do n't think this is his fault			0
he seems a good lad			0
it 's @entity18 putting the words in his mouth			1
' initially , @entity18 's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp			1
@entity50 says : ' @entity18 will talk reasonably in the negotiating room			1
but as soon as he gets outside he starts with the nonsense			0
' @entity18 ( centre ) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between @entity0 and @entity4 @entity2 ( right ) poses for a photo alongside father @entity10 ( centre ) and brother @entity59 in @entity60 in 2013 the @entity61 see a telling parable with the way @entity65 's critical harassment of @entity66 offended the @entity67			1
' @entity66 became annoyed and it was hard to blame him , ' says @entity10			2
' it was a fight he would have been happy to take but when the words became unpleasant he walked away for good			0
' and what 's happened to @entity65 after that ? virtually nothing			0
now he 's more less forgotten			0
i can see the same happening to @entity0			2
' yet @entity0 is a fight @entity2 would have been more than happy to have			1
we feel it 's a fairly comfortable fight for us			2
@entity0 has done ok but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of @entity2 's elite level he will be found out			1
' @entity18 needs to calm down			2
' if what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality , it is over to you mr @entity18			1
@entity18 , a fellow columnist here at @entity88 , has pushed through a number of matches with his outspoken pubic challenges			0
but last week he drew a frosty response from @entity93 and his legendary promoter @entity94 when he brandished at them a cheque for £ 1.5million for the @entity97 to meet his man @entity98 in a world super-bantamweight title unification fight			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) go face to face as promoter @entity18 looks on in the background @entity18 displays the cheque for £ 1.5m to set - up @entity98 's fight with @entity93 @entity2 has taken flak for lining up @entity12 for his next fight , after the @entity14 was decked six times en route to an embarrassing , wipe - out defeat by @entity111			1
but @entity112 did defeat the previously feared @entity114 puncher @entity113 to win the world lightweight title , which he still holds			0
and @entity2 says : ' @entity4 has n't done anything to compare with that			1
sadly @entity4 's recent performances against comparatively weak opposition have been anything but convincing			2
good luck to him getting the pay - night but he 's done nothing to justify this world title shot			0
' @entity2 jumped the gun in announcing @entity12 and the may 20 date at the @entity125 in @entity14 , since his advisor @entity126 was still finalising the deal			2
@entity12 ( left ) takes on @entity111 in a @entity129 welterweight title bout in @entity130 last year but all seems to be in place now and the official statement should come this week			0
@entity2 was criticised , also , for allegedly declining the @entity135 offer of a final eliminator against @entity137 for @entity0 's belt			1
@entity50 says : ' we could n't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which @entity0 is so desperate to have			1
' his son was also accused of being less than truthful for saying he knew nothing about the offer			0
but there are suggestions that the secretive @entity126 dismissed the @entity135 offer out of hand , without informing @entity2			0
@entity151 , having bravely lost his two challenges to @entity153 in @entity154 , now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion			0
only this time the elder of @entity160 's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title , even though it is against a far more formidable champion			0
@entity165 , still ranked by many among the top five pound - for - pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring , sees @entity151 as the ideal warm - up opponent , possibly before a rematch with @entity172			1
@entity151 ( right ) throws a punch towards @entity153 during their title fight in @entity176 in february @entity178 , @entity179 - based trainer of both @entity165 and @entity2 , says : ' @entity151 is who we want and i 'm told it 's a done deal			1
but it wo n't be for @entity165 's belt even though it will be over the 12 - round championship distance			2
' the @entity188 have ordered their two super-middle world champions – @entity165 ' super , ' @entity172 ' regular ' – to meet in a unification fight			1
@entity172 declared willingness if @entity165 returns the compliment by travelling to the @entity194 , having won their first meeting in the @entity197			1
@entity165 said he would make the away trip but only as far as @entity17 , not to @entity199 where @entity172 has long desired to box on his hometown @entity202			1
@entity165 ( left ) poses with his many title belts after defeating @entity204 in november 2013 @entity178 declares : ' @entity165 would have gladly taken @entity93 straight away			0
' but now it appears the @entity188 are granting the so - called @entity165 licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights , in his native city across the @entity210 from @entity211			0
@entity172 , meanwhile , is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the @entity23 , against the namesake son of @entity218 legend @entity217			0
step into @entity220 's @entity219 , @entity151			2
good luck to him , in every sense of the phrase			0
@entity165 ( left ) lands a left jab on @entity172 before going on to win their title bout in @entity228 in 2011			1

@entity0 was keen to fight @entity2 at @entity8 this *summer*
but instead @entity0 will take on @entity4 at the @entity16 on may 20
@entity2 's dad @entity10 says @entity0 could have had the fight he wanted
but @entity50 claims that promoter @entity18 has been ' disrespectful '
@entity165 sees @entity151 as an ideal opponent before a @entity172 fight
