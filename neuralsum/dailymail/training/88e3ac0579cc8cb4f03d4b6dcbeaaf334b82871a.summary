the captain of missing @entity1 received a two - minute call shortly before take - off from a mystery woman using a mobile phone number obtained under a false identity			1
it was one of the last calls made to or from the mobile of captain @entity1 in the hours before his @entity10 left @entity12 16 days ago			1
investigators are treating it as potentially significant because anyone buying a pay - as - you - go sim card in @entity18 has to fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number			1
but in this case police traced the number to a shop selling sim cards in @entity12			0
they found that it had been bought ‘ very recently ’ by someone who gave a woman ’s name – but was using a false identity			1
the discovery raises fears of a possible link between captain @entity1 , 53 , and terror groups whose members routinely use untraceable sim cards			1
everyone else who spoke to the pilot on his phone in the hours before the flight took off has already been interviewed			1
@entity53 : the mystery object in a @entity56 satellite image , inset , some 80 miles from the previous search zone today , planes and ships were scrambled to find a pallet and other debris in a remote patch of the southern @entity64 as the search resumed for the missing jet			0
the pallet was spotted by a search plane yesterday , but has not been closely examined			0
@entity70 pallets are commonly used in shipping , but can also be used in cargo containers carried on planes			0
it was the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to pin down to solve the mystery of what happened to flight 370 when it disappeared on march 8 with 239 people on board			0
in a separate development , @entity83 has learned that investigators are now poised to question captain @entity1 ’s estranged wife in detail			1
they have waited two weeks out of respect , but will now begin formally interviewing @entity24 following pressure from @entity93 agents assisting the inquiry			0
searching : @entity96 's deputy prime minister @entity95 ( right ) and @entity97 , senior search and rescue officer involved in the search , look at monitors at the @entity102 's centre in @entity103 although the couple – who have three children – were separated , they had been living under the same roof			1
a source said : ‘ @entity24 has been spoken to gently by officers but she has not been questioned in detail to establish her husband ’s behaviour and state of mind in the days leading to the incident			1
the latest release of a war - themed computer game – centred on a passenger plane that crashes on to a desert island in the @entity121 – has been delayed as the search for missing flight @entity1 continues			1
@entity124 , an update for the battlefield 4 game which has sold millions of copies worldwide , was due for release last week – but has now been put back until tuesday			1
‘ this is partly for cultural reasons			0
it is not considered appropriate in @entity18 to subject people in situations of terrible bereavement to the stress of intensive questioning			0
’ the softly - softly approach has been challenged by the team of @entity93 agents working with @entity18 police			2
they have pointed out that she may hold ‘ vital clues and information ’ to @entity1 ’s mental state			1
‘ the whole world is looking for this missing plane and the person who arguably knows most about the state of mind of the man who captained the plane is being left alone , ’ said a source close to the @entity93 team			0
the source added : ‘ if we want to eliminate the chief pilot from the inquiry , we must interview her in detail to find out what his state of mind was			2
’ the mystery caller emerged when @entity18 investigators examined the phone records of both @entity1 and his co-pilot , 27 - year - old @entity1			1
investigators were keen to trace the caller and interview them , although they have stressed that the fact the sim card was registered to a non-existent id card does not necessarily indicate a criminal or terrorist connection			1
political activists in @entity18 sometimes use sim cards bought with bogus identity cards if they fear that their phones may be bugged by the country ’s authoritarian ruling party			2
up and away : a @entity177 @entity176 takes off at @entity178 to join the search for the missing @entity1 in @entity180 , @entity96 looking : crew on board a @entity177 @entity176 , searching for the missing flight in the southern @entity64 the @entity83 revealed last week that @entity1 is an avid supporter of opposition leader @entity184 , a distant relative , and may have attended a controversial court hearing where @entity184 was jailed for five years			1
it took place only a few hours before the flight			1
' the whole world is looking for this missing plane and the person who arguably knows most about the state of mind of the man who captained the plane is being left alone ' source close to @entity93 team the timing of the call has intensified scrutiny on @entity1 as investigators struggle to establish whether the cockpit crew , a catastrophic accident or hijackers are to blame for @entity1 ’s disappearance			1
meanwhile @entity93 experts in the @entity205 are continuing to examine the hard drive of a flight simulator seized from @entity1 ’s home after it emerged that programs he used on it had been deleted			1
@entity1 used the home flight simulator to practise extreme landings , including on remote @entity64 islands such as the @entity205 air base in @entity215 , investigators have revealed			1
good luck : ground crew members wave to a @entity220 @entity219 patrol plane as it leaves the @entity222 in @entity223 heading for @entity96 to join the search and rescue operation looking : this graphic shows the approximate position of the objects seen floating in a @entity56 satellite image in the southern @entity64 on which the @entity102 is concentrating its search the hard drive was flown to the @entity93 laboratory in @entity233 , @entity234 , at the end of last week after @entity18 investigators failed to retrieve the deleted files , which they suspect may have been ‘ buried ’ in an elaborate process to cover the user ’s tracks			2
the delay in handing the computer hard drive to the @entity93 has proved to be a source of friction between the @entity18 and @entity205 investigators , the source close to the @entity93 said , adding : ‘ we have the technology to do this work quickly and effectively and they simply do n’t			2
’ @entity18 ’s acting transport minister @entity251 yesterday said investigators are coming under increasing pressure as they are aware that time is running out – the black box voice and data recorder only transmits an electronic signal for about 30 days before its battery runs out			2
but he claimed a thorough investigation of the plane ’s cargo manifest had not shown ‘ any link to anything that may have contribution to the plane ’s disappearance ’			0
by @entity266 a mystery object has been spotted in the @entity64 search zone – 80 miles from an earlier sighting of debris			0
measuring 74ft by 42ft , the object appears in a new image taken by a @entity56 @entity273 have been sent to investigate but a ferocious cyclone was yesterday hampering efforts to locate the possible wreckage			0
the news came two days after debris was detected 1,550 miles south - west of @entity180 in @entity96			2
an @entity96 @entity176 aircraft was sent to scour area where satellite imagery pinpointed possible debris the satellite picture of the possible debris was handed over by @entity56 and given a new focal point for search since the announcement , @entity96 search teams scouring the remote area reported seeing a number of small objects including a wooden pallet			0
@entity18 ¿ s acting transport minister , @entity251 revealed the image at a press conference a @entity297 air force @entity296 plane with specialist electro - optic observation equipment was diverted to the location , arriving after the first aircraft left , but reported sighting only clumps of seaweed			2
the @entity56 satellite discovery was revealed yesterday by @entity18 ’s acting transport minister , @entity251 at a press conference			0
he made the announcement after being handed a handwritten note			2
he said : ‘ the @entity56 ambassador has received satellite images of floating objects in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to investigate			0
’ @entity56 is one of 26 nations involved in the search for flight mh370			0
most of those on board the aircraft were @entity56 nationals			0
the @entity323 state news agency said the latest image was taken by @entity56 ’s @entity326 - 1 satellite at about 4am gmt on march 18 and showed objects some 80 miles ‘ south by west ’ from the first site			2
the announcement came after the first @entity96 @entity176 aircraft to make a sortie over the target zone returned without success			0
flying officer @entity334 , the @entity176 ’s captain , said a combination of ‘ less than ideal ’ weather and sea conditions had closed in on the flight			0
he said they covered their entire search area but had not seen any evidence of wreckage .			0

call was made to captain @entity1 just hours before he took off in @entity1
pay - as - you - go phone which made the call was bought with fake @entity350
fake id was used to get around *security* measures put in place after 9/11
@entity356 fears captain @entity1 may have links to terrorism
investigators will soon question the captain 's estranged wife in detail
