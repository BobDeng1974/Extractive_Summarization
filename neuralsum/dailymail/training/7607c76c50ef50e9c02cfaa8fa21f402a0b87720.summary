an obese mother was shocked into shedding a seven stone after a neighbour told her she looked like @entity3			2
@entity4 , 28 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , wore a dress size 22 and weighed 17 stone 2lb when she was compared with the spiritual figure , often depicted as a tubby cross-legged man			1
but eight months after cutting out processed food , sugar and her crisps and chocolate habit she slimmed to a size eight and now weighs just ten stone			1
' now i 'm a whole new person			0
it 's the best feeling in the world knowing i 'm not " the fat one " any more			1
' at her largest , @entity4 was terrified of breaking furniture or getting stuck on swings at the playground because of her giant frame , even though she 's only 5ft 5in			1
she even believed that her five - year - old daughter was embarrassed when she stood next to other mums , who were sometimes half her size , in the playground			0
the property developer had not weighed herself since her daughter was born and was self - conscious in front of her husband @entity22			0
but when in april 2014 , as she rested on a wall , a neighbour said the words , ' you look like a fat little @entity3 sitting there ' , she knew she had to act			1
@entity4 's slim frame is swamped by her old clothes after losing seven stone on the @entity50 before dropping from a size 22 to a size eight , @entity4 felt that her size embarrassed her young daughter @entity4 said : ' just taking my little girl to the playground used to be a struggle - i was scared that i would get wedged on a slide or break a bench under my weight			1
' i could n't be the mum i wanted and i think my daughter was embarrassed that i was the fat mum at the school gates			1
' when my neighbour nipped over and just said ' you look like a fat little @entity3 sitting there @entity4 , ' it was the final straw			1
' i know it was n't meant to be cruel , it was just an off - hand comment , but it really hit home that i needed to take action			2
' i signed up to do the @entity50 the next day and i 've never looked back			1
i ca n't thank him enough now			0
' a neighbour 's off - hand comment that she looked like ' a fat little @entity3 ' kickstarted an eight - month diet since going on her diet plan , @entity4 has cut out all processed food , sugar and her unhealthy snacks @entity4 had tried @entity81 and a juice diet before to no avail but since a friend had slimmed down with the @entity50 , she signed up on the spur of the moment			1
' i knew it would be hard but i cried when i got on the scales for the first time in five years and my consultant @entity90 read out that i weighed more than 17 stone , ' she said			0
before breakfast : coffee , full - fat milk and four sugars lunch : large cheese sandwich with mayonnaise and salad cream dinner : lasagne , chips , daughter 's leftovers snacks : three bags of crisps , three chocolate bars after breakfast : peanut butter bar lunch : healthy vegetable soup dinner : grilled chicken and roasted vegetables snacks : @entity50 shake ' but it really has turned out to be so simple			1
i do n't know why i did n't do it before			0
' i look at the labels on the things i used to have in my cupboards - all the chocolate , crisps and sweets - and ca n't believe i ever ate them			0
' i used to think that all the bad stuff tasted so good			0
i 've had to completely change the way i think to challenge my diet			0
' in the first week she lost 8lb after cutting out processed fats , sugars and snacks			2
in eight months she has dropped more than seven stone and now has no fears about the being compared to a fat little statue			2
' i still feel like a size 22 inside sometimes and i have to remind myself that i 'm not			0
i do n't look like a fat little @entity3 any more - everyone says i look great			2
' the weight came off so quickly that all my clothes were too big and i had nothing to wear			2
' my friend runs a clothes shop called @entity145 and @entity146 and she donated outfits to fit my new figure			0
' thankfully i know that i 'll never be compared to a @entity3 again ! '			0

@entity4 , 28 , was 17st 2lb when she confronted weight gain
mum from @entity5 , @entity6 , said the comment was the last straw
