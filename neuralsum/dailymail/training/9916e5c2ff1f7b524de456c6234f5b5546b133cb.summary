by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has been ruled out of the third test against @entity4 in @entity5 on saturday with a knee injury – leaving @entity7 on course to reclaim the @entity10 no 10 shirt			1
the @entity11 confirmed on tuesday morning that @entity2 sustained a strained medial ligament in his left knee during the 28 - 27 second @entity15 defeat in @entity16 last weekend and he will not be available for the series finale			1
it is a major disappointment for the 22 - year - old , who missed the first clash with the @entity21 in @entity22 due to his involvement in the @entity24			0
injury blow : @entity2 will play no further part in the series after damaging his knee below par : the @entity31 man was not at his best last weekend , picking up a yellow card revealing the bad news about the @entity31 stand - off , @entity10 head coach @entity33 said : ‘ the knee has been scanned and there is a strain there			1
it ’s disappointing for @entity2 as he was desperate to play in the final test but such is his character that he is already working on his rehab and still contributing to the tour			2
‘ fortunately we have three other fly - halves to call on and we ’ll make that selection call over the next few days			0
the squad trained well this morning and we will narrow down selection over the next 24 hours following the game this evening			0
’ @entity7 produced a superb performance at @entity52 , in his first @entity15 appearance for a year , and @entity55 ’s new recruit from @entity56 is certain to take on the playmaker ’s role again			0
yet , his return to the starting xv will leave a bench place up for grabs , with @entity62 seemingly ahead of @entity63 in the tussle to fill it			2
@entity10 ’s injury problems appear to be easing somewhat , as centres @entity66 and @entity68 – who picked up ankle knocks in @entity16 – both trained on tuesday			0
however , there remain doubts about first - choice scrum - half @entity75 ’s chances of shaking off a shoulder problem in time to play in @entity5			2
in contention : @entity7 ( right ) is set to start with @entity62 ( left ) on the bench			1

@entity2 out of @entity10 third test against @entity4 in @entity5
*saracens* fly half strained knee ligament in last weekend *'s* 28 - 27 defeat
@entity7 set to *replace* @entity2 with @entity62 on the bench
