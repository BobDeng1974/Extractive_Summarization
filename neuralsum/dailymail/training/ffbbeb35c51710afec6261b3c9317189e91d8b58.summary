each summer @entity1 ’s football hierarchy sit down to map out transfer targets for the following 12 months			1
back in august , the name of @entity4 was not on the list			2
that less than five months later the @entity7 champions are now on the verge of signing the @entity9 forward says much about how the ebb and flow of a football season can change things but also the enduring financial might of the world ’s richest club			1
it is understood the decision by football director @entity18 and manager @entity19 to pursue @entity4 was taken just 10 days ago and has been driven less by injury concerns over marquee centre forward @entity22 and more by a growing feeling that third - choice striker @entity23 may be sold this month			1
@entity4 scores past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity25 in november as @entity26 lost 2 - 1 @entity4 , pictured climbing above the @entity29 defence in march , says he always tries to be in the right place @entity23 could be allowed to leave the @entity31 this january , paving the way for @entity4 's arrival @entity4 was pictured at the airport on wednesday as he headed for the @entity35 he was pictured with his agent ( right ) as he prepared to head out and represent the @entity37 nevertheless , a mid-season commitment to a £ 30million outlay on a player who will be away at the @entity35 for the rest of this month is remarkable and points once again to just how powerful @entity1 can be in the market when they feel the need			1
one of @entity1 ’s most prominent objectives in recent times has been to ease themselves away from the image of a club prepared to throw money at everything , that of an organisation hard - pressed to get their heads round what is value for money and what is n’t			2
failing @entity60 ’s financial fair play test last year did n’t help but @entity1 ’s £ 200m investment in a new training ground was supposed to help the club draw a line in the sand			1
this , they told us , is where many of @entity1 ’s future first - team players will originate			2
@entity1 mean this , too			0
the club ’s owners knew their early habit of cherry - picking players from across the world - often at over-the - odds prices - had a limited shelf life and have actively moved away from such scattergun spending			0
@entity22 's ( left ) injury has been one of the factors that have forced @entity1 into the transfer market @entity83 ( left ) , talking to @entity22 during @entity1 training , has also been out injured nevertheless , @entity1 ’s plans to grow ‘ organically ’ in the future have been put into realistic context by issues surrounding @entity89 and now @entity4 in the past week			1
@entity19 ’s desire for @entity89 to stay at @entity1 longer than was first intended was as clear as it was understandable			0
the club ’s decision to then pull the rug from under the feet of its feeder club @entity95 was therefore something of a no - brainer			0
to work against the wishes of a coach trying to retain a league title under enormous pressure from @entity103 would have been self - defeating			0
@entity1 , though , will be picking up the pieces of that decision in @entity106 for some time to come			0
the club have spent millions attempting to win friends - and customers - on the other side of the @entity111 , and the @entity89 fiasco may well have swept away that goodwill in a single stroke			0
yet @entity1 clearly felt it was a price worth paying and their attitude reminds their rivals at home and in @entity60 that the single most important component of their business is winning football matches in @entity122 and the @entity123			0
@entity23 ( left ) could be sold this january , paving the way for @entity4 to arrive while @entity89 ( right ) will stay at @entity1 until the end of the season @entity4 has interested a number of clubs having scored the most @entity7 goals in the calendar yea certainly , @entity4 will help			1
strong , powerful and muscular , the @entity37 international is similar to @entity22 in style and - if he signs - will provide @entity19 with a like - for - like replacement for the @entity134 when he is missing and a rather impressive partner when @entity19 decides to play them both			0
@entity19 ’s current second - string striker @entity83 has his qualities but a consistent goalscorer he is not			0
by signing @entity4 , @entity1 will bring depth to their striking options that even @entity103 would envy			1
for all @entity143 ’s excellence so far this season , @entity103 look short when the @entity145 does not play			0
@entity1 , on the other hand , have managed to close the gap on @entity149 ’s team in the weeks that @entity22 has been injured and if february begins with the @entity152 lining up alongside a new partner , then perhaps the holders may begin to look upon themselves as title favourites for the first time since the season started			0
@entity157 ( left ) was allowed to leave the club at the start of the season to join @entity161 on loan @entity4 and his team - mates celebrate his goal at @entity165 against @entity166 , who opted against signing the striker on wednesday , @entity22 was back at @entity170 ’s @entity169 for a check - up on his knee ; he may well be on the bench for the game against @entity175 this weekend , while @entity83 is set to return after calf trouble			1
with @entity4 in the ranks , @entity1 will have to lose one player from a @entity123 roster restricted by @entity60 to 21 as punishment for breaching @entity182 guidelines			2
that player may well be @entity23 , who is attracting offers the club may well find hard to resist in the current transfer window			2
@entity60 ’s punishment for @entity1 ’s @entity182 breach also restricted spending to £ 49m net over this transfer window and the last			2
however , with @entity60 allowing @entity1 to take an agreed £ 25m fee from @entity161 for striker @entity157 , payable this coming summer , into account , they are comfortably within that margin			1
@entity4 , therefore , will become the club ’s 11th centre forward signed at a combined cost of about £ 275m since the takeover of august 2008			1
proof , perhaps , that the more some things change , the more they stay the same			0
@entity1 look set to sign @entity4 after opening talks with @entity26 over a £ 30million deal for the striker @entity4 celebrates after scoring for @entity26 against @entity204 during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity206 on @entity207			1

@entity1 are closing in on £ 30million signing of @entity4
@entity4 will be 11th striker signed since 2008 , at a combined cost of £ 275m
@entity26 forward 's arrival could signal exit for @entity23
@entity4 was not on @entity1 's list of *potential* transfer targets in the summer
but club want to ensure they *overhaul* @entity103 at top of @entity7
