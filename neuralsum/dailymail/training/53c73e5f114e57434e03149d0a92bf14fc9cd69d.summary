by @entity0 a worker at a @entity2 in @entity3 has been diagnosed with hepatitis a and now health officials fear that more than 5,000 customers may have been exposed to the disease			1
the infected individual has not been identified and the only detail that has been released is that they work at the @entity11 , @entity3 location			1
@entity13 reports that the employee 's condition was reported to the @entity11 - @entity16 on tuesday and they have now called on anyone who ate at the location at any point in the last two weeks			2
customer call back : an employee at this @entity11 , @entity3 @entity2 has hepatitis a and may have spread the disease to customers between may 6 and may 8 @entity24 is a highly - contagious liver disease that can cause inflammation which , in turn , prevents the organ from operating properly			1
the disease typically spreads through contact with water or food that an infected individual has touched , making the employee 's job at a fast food restaurant even more dangerous and susceptible to spread			0
' upon being informed of the incident , the @entity38 took all safety measures to ensure the well - being of our guests and team members including arranging the inoculation of all @entity11 team members with the immune globulin prophylaxis shot , ' @entity2 officials said in a statement			2
this is the second time this month that a @entity2 employee has been diagnosed with hepatitis a , though the earlier instance was at a @entity55 , @entity54 outpost			1
passing through food : @entity24 regularly spreads when infected individuals handle food or drinks in that case , the local health authority did not feel it was necessary to put out a call for the public to seek immediate medical treatment			2
that was n't the case in the latest case in @entity3 , as the county health department has announced that they feel anyone who ate at the restaurant between may 6 and may 8 should be immunized			0
' we did extensive investigations through inspections and determined it was a significant risk and that we needed to notify the public and have some immunization clinics to try to prevent any further spread of hepatitis a , ' @entity11 - @entity16 director @entity70 said			1
downward trend : the number of acute hepatitis a infections in the @entity82 have dropped dramatically due to the development of a vaccine the problem facing the containment process is that infected individuals do not necessarily display symptoms , though adults are more likely to feel nauseous and notice a spike in their temperature , a yellowing of their skin and vomiting			1
most cases are deemed mild and do not require serious treatment , resolving itself in a few weeks without causing permanent damage , but that is not always the case			0
' any time we have these cases we err on the side of caution			0
we never take the public â€™s health for granted so we have scheduled a couple of clinics , ' mr @entity70 said			0
this possible outbreak comes at a relative low point for the disease as the @entity111 have reported that while there were more than 30,000 cases of acute hepatitis a in the early 1990s but now the vaccine has led to only 2,700 acute cases being reported in 2011 .			0
