@entity0 will lambast the hypocrisy of critics who ‘ lecture ’ top fee - paying schools even though they benefited from a private education themselves or chose one for their children			1
in a keynote speech , he will claim that private schools are being made ‘ scapegoats ’ for society ’s problems instead of recognised for the ‘ general good ’ they do			1
he will argue that many of those in power are ‘ embarrassed ’ to be seen talking to independent school heads , preferring to threaten them with more state control or the loss of their historic charitable status			1
mr @entity0 , head of £ 32,850 - a - year @entity34 and chairman of the @entity36 ’ and @entity37 ’ conference , representing 260 top private schools , will use his speech today to respond to attacks on private education			1
it follows claims from @entity45 head sir @entity44 that private schools are ‘ bastions of privilege ’ which should do more to justify their charitable status and tax breaks			2
addressing @entity52 ’s annual conference in @entity53 , mr @entity0 will tell critics : ‘ it is time to stop scapegoating and start celebrating our schools and their contribution			2
stop using them as lazy shorthand for the social ills of our country			0
’ he will say that making school type ‘ a proxy for advantage ’ does little apart from stirring up ‘ the politics of envy ’			0
referring to the fact that many of those in power were privately educated , he will say : ‘ do n’t lecture us ... especially when many of you who do so , have yourselves benefited from or use the service we provide			2
hypocrisy is out of tune with the times			0
’ around 7 per cent of the @entity80 population is privately educated but in @entity82 this figure is much higher			1
a 2010 study showed 54 per cent of @entity85 mps went to a fee paying school , as well as 40 per cent of @entity88 and 15 per cent of @entity84			0
independent schools have ‘ centuries of expertise to offer ’ , mr @entity0 will say but ‘ too often those in power are embarrassed to be seen talking with us , preferring instead to threaten us with the loss of charitable status or more state control			1
‘ contrary to what some dinosaurs from the class war era would have you believe , we are not a drain on national resources ; we add significant value to @entity80 plc. ’ mr @entity0 will also point out that private schools are now more ethnically diverse than state schools and have forged many links with the state sector			1
‘ when it comes to social mobility we are part of the solution , not the root of the problem , ’ he will say			0
n mixed - sex schools are the best way for children to be taught , according to sir @entity44			0
he said that a mixed - school setting is far more ‘ congenial ’ and prepares children for work : ‘ girls and boys mix socially in the workplace			0
they should be educated together too			0
