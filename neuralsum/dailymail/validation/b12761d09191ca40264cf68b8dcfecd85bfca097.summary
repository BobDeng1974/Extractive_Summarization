experts working at the @entity11 site have suggested the items were toys made by early hominids between 1.77million and 1.95million years ago			1
discovery : scientists believe they may have uncovered evidence of a two - million - year - old playground in @entity3 ( file picture ) the leader of the project , paleoanthropologist @entity21 , has described the discovery as ‘ amazing ’			1
the @entity23 quotes the @entity25 expert as saying : ‘ the site is a treasure chamber that may hold some useful clues to answer a lot of important questions , from the social structure of the early hominids to whether , when and how they arrived in @entity33 all the way from @entity35			2
’ close to 20,000 fragmented pieces but larger items – the majority between 20 and 50mm long - are believed to have been made by women and children			2
@entity41 said one ‘ finely made and beautifully shaped ’ item was possibly a gift made by a mother for her child adding that ‘ you can almost feel the maker ’s love and passion ’			0
researchers said the lack of evidence of animal remains and large stone tools added weight to the argument that the area was used by children rather than adults			0
scientists dated the site , discovered in 2002 , using a special geochronological tool			0
researchers found more than 700 stone artefacts in an area of less than six square metres in the @entity7 ( pictured ) , @entity8 province the items have been excavated and documented with the findings due to be published in an archaeological journal in @entity3			1

however , a debate has surfaced over the findings and researcher @entity75 of the @entity76 of @entity77 said it was important to determine whether the artefacts were all hand made			0
the @entity23 report him as saying : ‘ it is difficult to rule out the possibility that they were just stone fragments created by natural forces			0
‘ to determine whether they were hand - made artefacts may go beyond the limit of science today			0
