by @entity0 usually the number one requirement of a map is accuracy , but one of the world ’s first printed atlases - that contains a bizarre and distorted map of @entity10 - is on sale for £ 90,000			1
the barely unrecognisable shape of the @entity13 was an interpretation of the works of @entity17 mathematician , astrologer and geographer @entity19			1

normally the number one requirement of a map is for it to be accurate , but one of the world 's first printed atlases ( that contains a bizarre and distorted map of @entity10 pictured ) is on sale for £ 90,000 the atlas is an interpretation of the works of @entity17 mathematician , astrologer and geographer @entity19 it was n’t until 1,300 years later after the process of printing developed that @entity19 's works were turned into a printed atlas , called @entity34			1
one rare copy of the book has now emerged for sale in @entity38			1
on the pages that cover @entity10 , the outline for the coast of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 is comparatively accurate			0
yet , the @entity13 are bent out of shape and look twice as thin as it does in reality			1
@entity19 lived between 90 - 168 ad and wrote about the world ’s geography in the @entity17			1
it was n’t until 1,300 years later after the process of printing developed that @entity19 ’ works were turned into a printed atlas , called @entity34 @entity54 has a lot of detail , which includes @entity57 and the @entity58			1
one rare copy of the book has now emerged for sale in @entity38 the south west of @entity62 , famous for its rugged coastline , is a rectangular shape with straight lines , while the south east from @entity66 to @entity67 is pushed upwards at a 45 degree angle			1
the rest of @entity62 is much narrower , and the east coast is where @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 should be			0
although the @entity77 coastline is recognisable , @entity75 appears to have grown a large appendage that sticks out into the @entity79 and spreads across to where @entity80 is			0
because @entity10 is half the size it should be , the @entity79 , or @entity84 , is twice as wide			0
to the west , @entity85 is reasonably accurate in terms of shape , although it is positioned further north than it ought to be			2
@entity89 , the deputy chairman of @entity90 , said : ' the book was first printed in 1475 as text only and then the illustrations of the maps appeared 15 years later			1
' @entity19 ’s @entity34 was a ground - breaking treaty that challenged medieval map - making and revolutionised cartography			1
' @entity99 maps at the time were created to reflect the importance of landmarks and powerful cities were often disproportionately portrayed against their surroundings , irrespective of their actual size			0
' @entity19 ’s @entity34 used mathematical calculations in an attempt to create accurate representations of the land , thus changing map - making for centuries to come			1
much more information was clear at that time about @entity114			0
@entity89 , the deputy chairman of @entity90 , said : ' @entity19 's @entity34 was a ground - breaking treaty that challenged medieval map - making and revolutionised cartography ' the south western edge of the known world which purports to show @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			1
@entity19 's @entity34 was a ground - breaking treaty that challenged medieval map - making and revolutionised cartography ' this rare survivor is the fifth edition of @entity19 ’s work which is split into two parts			1
book one is a thorough discussion on the geography of the @entity133 and the second book is a compilation of maps			1
' without being able to have a bird ’s eye view , it is an artist ’s idea of what @entity10 looked like			2
you get a good sense of the different countries and continents			0
' all 15th century books by their nature are pretty scarce , not many copies survive today			0
' looking back , the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world			2
the 1507 @entity153 map named and envisaged @entity154 as a separate continent for the first time			0
perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the @entity159 , the map shows what we now know is the @entity162 lapping the western coast of @entity154 , though its existence was only confirmed years late			2
a century later the @entity165 , created in 1623 reveals the ancient @entity167 view of the world			2
a depiction of the world by @entity171			2
it 's said that @entity173 used this map or one like it to persuade @entity175 and @entity176 to support him in the early 1490s			0
the map was made by a @entity179 cartographer living in @entity180 and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface made for the @entity188 , this is the earliest known @entity167 terrestrial globe , and a fusion of @entity191 and @entity192 cultures			2
the creators exaggerated the size of @entity167 and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off - shore islands			1
the biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries			1
take a look at a map today , and you ’re likely to see that @entity210 is larger than @entity54 , @entity206 is larger than @entity211 and @entity167 is smaller than @entity212			0
photo of a genuine hand drawn world map , it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period			2
the biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map a @entity222 map created in 1569			1
in the @entity222 projection , @entity210 looks at least as big , if not slightly larger , than @entity54			0
and @entity212 also looks of comparable size the @entity225 which was made for the @entity188 in 1623			0
the creators exaggerated the size of @entity167 and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands but in reality @entity167 is four times bigger than @entity212 , @entity54 is three times bigger than @entity210 and @entity211 is larger than @entity206			1
the distortion is the result of the @entity222 projection , the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books , which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world			2
today , billions of searches are made on @entity241 each day , helping people navigate their way around , streets , towns and countries			0
@entity241 claims that it is on a ‘ never - ending quest for the perfect map ’ , but @entity250 , historian of cartography and the author of @entity253 in @entity254 , is n’t so sure			0
he argues that all maps are of their time , their place and serve certain purposes			0
‘ no world map is , or can be , a definitive , transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world , ’ he writes			0
‘ each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users , as their understanding of the world changes			0
’ the @entity222 projection , the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books , was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world			0
the familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses , but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north @entity241 claims that it is on a ' never - ending quest for the perfect map ' , but @entity250 , historian of cartography and the author of @entity253 in @entity254 , is n't so sure			0
