the 32 - year - old @entity42 had just completed her initial installation run when her car ran into the tailgate of a support truck at around 20 - 30mph , which was at such a height to inflict the head trauma			1

@entity1 have now confirmed , however , surgery began yesterday afternoon , with @entity35 in theatre until this morning			0

' finally , we have been overwhelmed by messages of support for @entity0 , her family and the team and we would like to express our sincere gratitude for those			1

@entity20 has confirmed investigations into the accident are ongoing , adding : ' we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment			0
' witnesses said @entity35 's helmet and the front of her @entity70 car took the bulk of the impact			0

something seemed amiss with the car before it hit the lorry , according to @entity146 , a @entity147 presenter who witnessed the accident			2
emergency workers and @entity151 staff at the scene at @entity5 today racing in the blood : @entity35 is the daughter of former @entity8 driver @entity155 the 32 - year - old @entity42 was taken to @entity18 's hospital @entity1 's race regulars are @entity159 driver @entity158 ( above ) , who missed the last @entity160 in @entity161 through illness , and @entity164 @entity163 ' she got into the car , fired it up and did a test run at probably about 200mph in the rain , ' he said			1
' the car was slightly misfiring but there did n't seem to be any concerns			0

she slowed down but then suddenly , inexplicably , accelerated through the crowd and smashed into the side of the truck			0
' mr @entity146 's son , @entity180 , said it was a miracle none of the @entity1 mechanics near the lorry was mown down			0

she was pulling in for mechanics to inspect the car in the makeshift pit area when it took off and crashed at around 40mph			1
it has been suggested that the anti-stall mechanism on her car kicked in and propelled her forward			1
' there was a sort of board down , like a loading board , and the car went careering into the side of that , ' mr @entity146 said			0
' the top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it			0
' miss @entity0 remained motionless for around 15 minutes while paramedics treated her			1
