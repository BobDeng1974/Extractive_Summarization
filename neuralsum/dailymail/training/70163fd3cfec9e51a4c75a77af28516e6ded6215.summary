@entity2 ’s troubled @entity1 rover has started its third , and potentially final , snooze on the moon			1
the crippled rover has been stuck in its place due to an mechanical problem that occurred at the end of january			2
a photo from the rover showing a portion of the @entity13 lunar lander was circulated on @entity14 over the weekend with the caption ‘ @entity16 ’			2
this photo from the rover showing a portion of the @entity13 lunar lander was circulated on @entity14 over the weekend the state - run @entity21 news service 's @entity14 account added that @entity1 's mechanical problems remained unresolved			1
two weeks ago , @entity2 restored communications with the @entity17 , but engineers are still working to fix its mechanical problems , state media said			0
the official @entity21 cited @entity28 , the lunar probe programme 's spokesman , as saying the rover had survived the frigid cold of the moon 's nights			1
the @entity1 rover is designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data			0
after five months stranded on the moon , @entity2 's @entity1 lunar rover is still alive and functional			1
@entity2 state media said on yesterday that technical problems and bitterly cold lunar nights have ' weakened considerably ' the buggy 's ability to operate but it ran into problems in january it was shutting down in preparation for the lunar night , which lasts two weeks			1
the problems were a rare setback for @entity2 , which in recent years has conducted space walks and placed a space station in orbit			0
last month , @entity2 's @entity55 rover was declared dead on the @entity57 's surface in a major setback for the country 's ambitious space programme			1
the potential to extract the moon 's resources has been touted as a key reason behind @entity66 's space programme			0
the moon is believed to hold uranium , titanium , and other mineral resources , as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation			0
' @entity2 wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy , ' said @entity2 space expert @entity75 , a professor of national security affairs at the @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80			0
' with the @entity83 exploration moribund at best , that opens a window for @entity2 to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the @entity83 still has more , and more advanced , assets in space			0
' the landing was a key step forward in @entity66 's ambitious military - run space programme , which include plans for a permanent orbiting station by 2020 and eventually sending a human to the moon			1
but @entity28 said the rover had ' come back to life ' soon after despite space experts ' earlier concerns that it might not survive the extremely low temperatures of the lunar night , when the temperature drops to @entity103 ( -292 ° f )			1
' the rover stands a chance of being saved now that it is still alive , ' @entity28 was quoted as saying			0
he said it was still unclear what caused the problem			0
the mission is proving a popular success for @entity2 's military - backed space programme			0
updates about the rover 's progress have been posted on an unofficial @entity2 microblog account written with @entity1 's ' voice ' , attracting tens of thousands of comments by @entity2 internet users			0
the @entity1 , or @entity1 in @entity2 , was deployed on the moon on december 15 and was a huge source of pride in @entity2 , which is only the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the @entity83 and the @entity124			1
the silver rover experienced a ' mechanical control abnormality ' late january due to ' the complicated lunar surface environment ' , according to the official @entity21 news agency , and has been unable to function since then			1
condolences poured in on @entity130 , @entity2 's @entity14 - like service , where internet users mourned the demise of the rover , according to @entity135 's report titled ' loss of lunar rover '			1
the @entity1 rover had previously sent back its first pictures from the moon and officials lauded the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades as a step forward for ' mankind as a whole '			2
' exploration of outer space is an unremitting pursuit of mankind , ' @entity2 's space agency , the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) said after the rover was deployed on the moon			2
the mission reflects ' the new glory of @entity2 to scale the peaks in world science and technology areas , ' it said , adding it was committed to exploring and using space ' for peaceful purposes '			0
the lunar mission , which comes a decade after @entity2 first sent an astronaut into space , is seen as a symbol of the country 's rising global stature and technological advancement , as well as the @entity163 's success in reversing the fortunes of the once - impoverished nation			2
@entity66 plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020 and eventually send a human to the moon			0
the sky over the moon appears inky black in this picture showing the @entity1 rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the @entity13 lander the potential to extract the moon 's resources has been touted as a key reason behind @entity66 's space programme , as the moon believed to hold uranium , titanium , and other mineral resources , as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation			1
the six - wheeled @entity1 vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years			2
it is designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data , along with its stationary lander , @entity13			0
a digitally - combined panoramic photo shows the moonscape around the @entity196 over 150,000 people follow the rover 's progress on its microblog , which posted last month that repairs were underway and that all hope was not lost			2
‘ sorry to make you all sad			0
the engineers and i have n't given up yet , ’ the post said			0
news of the rover 's troubles were splashed across @entity2 newspapers and even featured at the @entity212 's daily briefing			0
the problems appeared to be related to the solar - powered probe 's process for shutting down for the lunar night , which lasts more than two weeks			1
the probe had survived its first shutdown , during which it was unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact			1
the rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as @entity227 , or the @entity227 , at a speed of 200 yards per hour			0
the landing vehicle , which has already shut down for the lunar night , is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year			1
online speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward , leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures			1
it will not be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two - week break			1
@entity2 scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch			2
the six - wheeled @entity1 vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years			2

@entity252 's process for shutting down for the night *malfunctioned* in january
the *damaged* rover is now entering its third sleep cycle on the moon
a lunar night lasts two weeks and temperatures can drop to minus *180* ° c
@entity57 dust may have blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward , leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures
scientists wo n't know if probe will work until after the two - week period
