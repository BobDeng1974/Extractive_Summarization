by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 11 august 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 11 august 2012 missing schoolgirl 12 - year - old @entity2 's body was found in her grandmother 's house , but why did it take seven days to find it ? police have admitted ' human error ' meant officers failed to discover the body of @entity2 in her grandmother 's house one week after her disappearance			1
more than 100 officers were assigned to the case , yet had no success in locating her for seven days , even though she was found in @entity20 's house - the first location the police were called to			1
day after day the police searches saw little progress , even the addition of highly - trained sniffer dogs , who were brought into the house , failed to find any trace the 12 - year - old			1
the blunders have caused a wave of criticism of the police who today apologised to @entity37 's mother for their handling of the case			2
in a statement @entity41 commander @entity40 said : ' an early review has been conducted and it is now clear that human error delayed the discovery of the body within the house			1
' we have apologised to @entity37 's mother that our procedures did not lead to the discovery of the body on this search			1
' he told the press conference at @entity56 today : ' it is important that we explain more about the circumstances of the searches			0
' four scene examinations were conducted of the property			1
the first followed immediately from the missing person report that was received on friday 4 august			0
an initial visit was made to assess the situation and examine the property			2
this visit was not regarded or viewed as a full search of the property			2
' the second visit was a full search of the property with the consent of the occupiers			2
this was conducted on 5 august over a period of two hours			0
all parts of the premises were searched including the location where a body was discovered , five days later , on friday 10 august			0
' ' a third visit was undertaken on 8 august			0
this was not a search , but the attendance of a body recovery dog to assist the investigation team in their enquiries			1
' it is not appropriate to comment further on aspects of the criminal investigation currently being conducted but our investigation was such that it was decided that a further intrusive search needed to be undertaken - it was that search , yesterday , which resulted in the discovery			1
' on behalf of the @entity94 i apologise for the distress and concern this delay will have caused			0
' specially - trained sniffer dogs were brought into @entity2 's grandmother 's house to help find clues			1
yet they did not find her body until two days after the dogs were used @entity20 's house , the eventual scene of @entity37 's body , was searched on several occasions by forensic officers @entity112 in the @entity111 estate where @entity37 lived have already expressed their disappointment in the police 's performance , saying they felt let down			1
retired @entity56 commander @entity117 is the most senior figure so far to go public with criticism of the way the case has been handled			0
' the police should have gone into that house quicker			2
clearly @entity124 should have been treated as a suspect from the off			0
he was the last person to see @entity37 alive , ' he told @entity127 ' if police have enough evidence to bring in sniffer dogs , then they have enough evidence to pull the place apart			1
it 's unforgiveable they did n't do that			2
' ' you ca n't rely on a dog - you need human beings			1
they have n't done very well			0
that child should have been found much quicker			0
' the alarm was first raised over @entity37 's disappearance on the evening of friday august 3 when she did not appear for her dinner			0
the police , some diverted from @entity149 duty , with the help of local residents , began searching the local area on saturday 4 august			0
a whole hoard of police were involved in looking for @entity37 , with some even pulled off @entity149 duty to find her police teams searched bins in the area of @entity2 's disappearance and stopped local collections taking place on sunday 5 august a pair of glasses were found in a nearby street which was cordoned off			1
the glasses were later discounted			0
monday saw police begin to look through @entity167 footage of of trams and buses between @entity111 and @entity170 , where @entity124 said @entity37 was headed			0
the next day saw specialist police search woodland known as @entity172 , the search included garages , sheds , outhouses , and a local school			2
refuse collections were then withdrawn in the local area to help the search			0
sniffer dogs were sent into @entity20 's house on wednesday 8 august , specially trained to detect blood and evidence of composition			1
it was on this day when @entity124 was interviewed as a witness			0
the search returned to @entity20 's house on friday 10 august , and this was when the body was eventually found			1
video : so many forensic officers outside the house ... sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			2
