by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:15 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:10 est , 27 december 2013 a stroke survivor is learning to walk again with the help of a revolutionary robotic leg - which predicts her movements			1
@entity7 , 51 , lost nearly all the use of her left arm and leg following a blood clot in her brain			1
but thanks to the new leg - and hours of hard work - she is hoping to get rid of her wheelchair for good			1
she is now learning to walk again with the help of a revolutionary robotic leg which predicts her movements one of just two in the @entity22 , the thigh - high device is controlled by a super-sensitive insole in her trainer which decodes her intended manoeuvre through tiny initial movements			1
the £ 30,000 gadget then instantly moves - as if reading her mind - doing some of the work needed to help the wearer walk or stand up			0
it helps the mother - of - two build up her muscles and also retrains the parts of her brain which were damaged when she had her stroke			1
mrs @entity7 , of @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ' the leg is amazing			1
there are little electrodes that go in the insole in my trainer and when i start to move just a tiny bit it stimulates the bionic leg to move , taking away some of the effort needed to walk or stand			1
' it reacts to what i do , almost calibrating how much effort i am doing myself			0
i ’ve only been using it for two or three months but i can notice the difference already			0
unique : mrs @entity56 has one of just two of the devices available in the @entity22			0
the thigh - high device is controlled by a super-sensitive insole in her trainer which decodes her intended manoeuvre through tiny initial movements ' my mantra in life is that i kissed death and now i ’m hugging life			1
if i did n’t have that determination i would never be where i am now			0
' unaware she was experiencing tell - tale signs of a stroke , mrs @entity7 had trouble typing on her keyboard the day before her clot fully formed in july 2010			1
she put it down to a migraine and took painkillers before driving home , making dinner and heading to bed			0
but when she woke up at 2am to go to the bathroom , she smacked her head off the shower door			0
@entity7 said : ' my head was banging against the shower cubicle and my husband woke up and came into see me and realised that my face was dropping			2
moving : the £ 30,000 gadget then instantly moves - as if reading the wearer 's mind - doing some of the work needed to help them walk or stand up			0
it also helps them retrain the parts of the brain which are damaged during the stroke ' his father had a stroke so he knew what he was looking at			1
' he rang 999 and i could hear him saying i was having a stroke			2
i remember thinking " that ca n’t be right - i ’m 48 , only old people have strokes , how the hell can that be happening to me ? ’ " ' mrs @entity7 slipped in and out of consciousness for three days after she was rushed to the @entity108 in @entity109			2
progress : mrs @entity7 is hoping to get rid of her wheelchair soon she was transferred to a specialist rehabilitation unit in @entity113 , @entity39 , after two weeks , where she spent four months regaining some use of her arm and leg			1
mrs @entity7 - who uses a stick and a wheelchair - has been using the bionic leg at @entity121 in @entity113 for three months			1
it has been loaned to personal trainer @entity123 by @entity126 inventors @entity124 , who are keen to get @entity22 feedback on their newest invention			0
mr @entity123 said : ' it helps people walk further , faster and for longer and gives them the confidence and self esteem that they can do it without the bionic leg			0
' they can do activities like squatting , cross training and walking , standing up and sitting down , without falling over and without their walking aids			0
' when they have been walking for ten to 15 minutes with the leg on , when we take the leg off the muscles as switched on			2
' they are ready to go doing that activity again and the brain sort of remembers that muscles needed and how to work without the leg on			2
' mrs @entity7 , who returned to work in telesales in january , added : ' i can feel the difference already			2
i ’m going to be out of that wheelchair for good sooner or later			0
