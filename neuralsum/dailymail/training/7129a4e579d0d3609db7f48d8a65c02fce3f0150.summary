@entity0 have failed to win a @entity2 game without @entity3 since april last year following the weekend draw with @entity5			1
and the bad news for @entity0 boss @entity7 is that he could be without his talisman until they face @entity10 on february 21 as @entity3 takes part in the @entity12 with @entity13			0
@entity0 's failure to win without the midfield powerhouse will be of grave concern for @entity7 in this crucial month in the race for the title			0
@entity3 played for @entity13 in an @entity12 warm - up match against @entity20 on sunday toure was named @entity22 for a record fourth time last week @entity0 vs @entity24 - jan 18 @entity0 vs - jan 24 @entity25 vs @entity0 - jan 31 @entity0 vs @entity26 - feb 7 @entity27 vs @entity0 - feb 11 city have back - to - back @entity2 games against @entity24 and league leaders @entity25 either side of an @entity34 clash with @entity35 in the next three weeks			1

@entity0 have won nine of their last 11 league games and @entity3 was absent in the two matches that they failed to get the maximum - the 1 - 1 draw with @entity5 and the clash with @entity49 on december 28 when @entity0 threw away a two - goal lead to draw 2 - 2			0
@entity13 captain @entity3 gives a speech after being crowned the best @entity53 player toure was absent as @entity0 lost ground on @entity25 after drawing 1 - 1 with @entity5 during that impressive run , @entity3 was instrumental as he scored six goals in eight games to help fire @entity0 to within touching distance of @entity62 's side			2
toure was present in four games that @entity0 have failed to win this season , including a defeat by @entity27 and the draw with @entity25 at the @entity68 in september			0
