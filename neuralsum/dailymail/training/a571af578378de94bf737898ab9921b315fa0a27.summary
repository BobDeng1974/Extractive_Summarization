new documents filed by the @entity1 against @entity3 militant @entity2 further shut down claims made by the @entity6 administration that the @entity8 attack sprouted from from an anti-islam film			1
the documents come after recent comments made by former secretary of state @entity12 that some of the attackers may have been influenced by the online video			2
the court filings make clear those who organized the attack were part of a ' conspiracy ' involving several members of the @entity24 ' @entity23 extremist militia ' , reports @entity25			1
the government are trying to ensure @entity2 remains behind bars			0
a group of 20 or more ' armed men ' , including militia members , assembled outside the @entity40 compound at 9:45 p.m. the night of sept. 11 , 2012 , and ' aggressively breached ' the gate carrying rifles , handguns and rocket - propelled grenade launchers			1
they then stole a @entity40 vehicle , ' forcibly entered ' buildings and stole @entity40 property			2
' during this initial attack , buildings within the @entity65 were set on fire , ' the court document says , according to @entity68			0
the attack ' ultimately led to the deaths ' of @entity40 ambassador @entity71 and information management officer @entity72			1
some personnel were able to escape the a nearby building			0
@entity2 entered the compound and ' supervised the exploitation of material from the scene '			0
the government motion went on to describe how @entity2 spent the days following the attack obtaining weapons and other equipment to defend himself ' from feared @entity40 retaliation ' and capture			1

angry : a protester reacts as the @entity40 @entity93 in @entity8 is seen in flames in this september 11 , 2012 file photo attack : the @entity40 @entity93 in @entity8 is seen in flames on september 11 , 2012 the defendant is being held at a detention center outside @entity100 at a hearing on wednesday , a @entity2 defense attorney complained that the defense team had limited access to the @entity1 's evidence			1
the details in the first few @entity40 court documents are a far cry from the @entity6 administration 's initial narrative			1
officials said the impetus of the attack was an anti-islam video that was ' the result of opportunism , taking advantage of and exploiting what was happening as a result of reaction to the video that was found to be offensive '			0
then - @entity122 ambassador @entity121 infamously cited the video on several sunday shows after the attack			2
the @entity6 administration has since acknowledged that there was no protest leading up to the attack , as there had been in other countries in the @entity130 and @entity131			1
the @entity134 's @entity133 report concluded ' there was no protest prior to the attacks , which were unanticipated in their scale and intensity '			0

@entity145 , in her new book @entity144 , argued that it is ' inaccurate ' to say no one was influenced by the video			0
' i was trying to make sense of it			0
i think that the investigations that have been carried out basically conclude we ca n't say that everybody was influenced [ by the video ] , and we ca n't say everybody was n't , ' she said in a @entity25 interview			0
even a bipartisan @entity159 report released in january said : ' some intelligence suggests the attacks were likely put together in short order , following that day 's violent protests in @entity164 against an inflammatory video			2
