by @entity0 following reports that billions of bee colonies across the world are facing extinction , a team of designers have decided to take matters into their own hands			2
the @entity10 project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart hives that monitor and track the health of bee colonies globally			1
the hives are sold either on their own , or with a sensory kit that sends data to an open platform called @entity19			1
this data is then analysed by experts in a bid to find a solution to the decreasing bee populations			1
the @entity26 project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart beehives that monitor and track the health of colonies			1
the design of the open - source hive , pictured , is based on the traditional design of the @entity34 a team of @entity37 scientists plan to mount tiny sensors to 5,000 honey bees and monitor where they fly			1
the plan will be the first of its kind to track bees as they move in real - time			2
the sensors use radio frequency identification chips and would record when the bee passes a certain point			0
this data would then be sent back to @entity37 's @entity49 to be analysed			0
this sensory kit was developed by @entity51 and is an open source platform , including hardware , a website and an app. the designs of the open - source hives are based on the traditional look of the @entity34 , or @entity59			1
it is built by adding hives boxes to the bottom of the structure - rather than the top - to encourage bees to build down			0
this is how they typically create their hives in the wild			0
the parts of the open - source hives are printed on a 3d printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled			1

the parts of the open - source hives are printed on a 3d printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled all the sections then slot together , removing the need for potentially harmful screws and glue			1
the designs for the hives , called the @entity90 and the @entity91 , are also downloadable and available from the project ’s @entity93 campaign			2
this means anyone with their own 3d printer can produce their own range of hives at home			0
‘ these hives aim to prioritise bee colony health , make beekeeping more accessible and will ultimately allow you to log and study the health of your colony , ’ said the designers			2
the hives are sold either on their own , or with a sensory kit , pictured , that sends data to an open platform called @entity19			1
this sensory kit was developed by @entity51 and includes hardware , a website and an app the data sent to the @entity19 platform , plus the geolocation tags , are used to compare and analyse the hives to help prevent decreasing bee populations			1
stock image of honeybees pictured ‘ your contribution will help us develop sensors to enhance our hives , connecting them to the @entity131 to log data about what is causing the bees to disappear around the world			2
‘ this data can be used to study colony health , build hard evidence against the causes of the problem and generate policy change and informed solutions moving forward			0
’ the sensors that collect data can also be used to send warnings to a smartphone in the event of an emergency , or if something goes wrong			0
for $ 100 ( £ 60 ) , @entity93 investors receive a @entity151 kit sold with a miniature laser - cut beehive and the download kit			0
the download kit on its own costs $ 15 ( £ 9 )			0
the full - sized hives cost $ 300 ( £ 180 ) without sensors , or $ 600 ( £ 361 ) with the full @entity19 pack			1
all packs are due to shipped this month .			0

*eco-technologists* have created an open - source project for smart beehives
3d - printed hives can be fitted with sensors to track the health of colonies
this sensory kit sends data to an open platform called @entity19
the data , plus the geolocation tags , are used to compare and analyse the hives to help prevent bee populations decreasing
