by @entity0 pearly queen : the @entity2 - the largest pearl in the world , once part of the crown jewels of the @entity7 - is on display at the @entity9 a parasitic invertebrate that has just been pooed out by a shark is hardly the place you 'd go to find that classy necklace			1
but experts have scuppered the popular belief that pearls form through friction with a grain of sand - saying that they actually build around tapeworm larvae			1
the revelation , which might have surprised fans of the beads such as @entity25 and @entity26 , comes as part of a new exhibition at the @entity9 in @entity29			1
a video demonstrating how the precious stones form when tapeworm larvae excreted by sharks and stingrays become trapped in water - filtering shellfish such as oysters will be on show at the museum 's pearls exhibition , which begins on saturday			1
the show 's co-creator , @entity40 , said : ' the people marketing ( pearls ) prefer to say , " it is so fantastic , your necklace was made from a grain of sand "			1
' it is better to speak about a grain of sand than to speak about a piece of s * * * from a stingray			0
' the somewhat unsavoury origins of the pearl have been known since 1852 , when @entity57 of @entity58 proved that a parasitic flatworm called the @entity60 was the cause of the stones forming inside freshwater mussels			2
... and here 's the little guy who made it : the larvae of a tapeworm , which gets into shellfish and causes them to excrete a substance that forms into a pearl precious : an @entity74 pearl necklace , previously owned by @entity26 , which is one of the items in the @entity9 exhibition the tapeworm had its crucial role in pearl formation acknowledged in a 1903 paper by @entity82 and @entity83 on pearl fisheries in @entity85			1
pearls can form around any parasite - including fish and snails - that has drilled into the the flesh of sea creatures such as mussels , but tapeworms and flatworms that have been excreted by larger animals are the most common invaders			1
the immune system of the shellfish then fights the worm by surrounding them with layer upon layer of nacre - a calcium - based material that makes up their shells - causing the parasite to suffocate and become trapped in this solid casing			1
wealth : the @entity109 that was given to @entity110 as a wedding present in 1878 ancient and modern : the @entity113 ( top ) and ring ( centre ) once owned by @entity117 film star @entity25 , left , and right , the @entity119 pearl , which was previously owned by @entity121 of @entity122 oysters , which produce a milky nacre , are the most common source for commercial pearls , but other animals can produce pearls that are black , blue , red or green , depending on the natural colour of their nacre			1
pearls are most abundant where ecosystems thrive from larger predators through to the parasites and their hosts			1
the @entity9 exhibition explores the history of pearls , chronicling how the jewels went from being a luxury adored by royalty ( queen @entity144 loved pearls so much she had @entity146 ’s create black pearl jewellery when she was in mourning ) to objets d’art , by jewellers such as @entity151 @entity150 , and a mass - produced product worn by fashionistas and aristos alike			1
aristocracy : the @entity157 tiara , owned by the stepmother to the late @entity159 fit for a princess : the @entity162 tiara , worn by both wives of prince @entity164 of @entity165 @entity166 natural : the exhibition opens on saturday and includes historical displays and features about the science of pearls it goes back to the invention of the cultured pearl and how @entity175 produced it on an industrial scale in @entity178			1
@entity26 wore a 16in string of @entity175 pearls to court the day she divorced her second husband @entity181 in 1954			2
after the war , the @entity117 hits of the 1940s and the 1950s generated a feelgood factor and a style that was desired – if not affordable for ordinary @entity187			0
@entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 were among the actresses who wore pearl chokers made up of cultured pearls – they gradually started to take over from natural pearls			1
for centuries , pearls had been a sign of extreme wealth			2
finding one usually required a diver to open 2,000 oysters , – but @entity175 , who headed the company which made @entity26 ’s necklace , pioneered the commercial ‘ culturing ’ of pearls , where irritants were deliberately introduced to oysters to farm jewellery			1
@entity175 said he wanted to ‘ adorn the necks of all women around the world with pearls ’			2
the new exhibition at the @entity9 in @entity29 features jewellery from @entity25 's ( left )			1
the @entity215 ( right ) with a £ 48 pair of drop - pearl earrings by @entity218 history went full circle when @entity215 , @entity215 , wore a £ 48 pair of drop - pearl earrings by @entity218 , to the celebration of the @entity224 in 2012			1
the exhibition also features @entity25 ’s stunning @entity227 pendant earrings , a pearl - drop earring worn by @entity166 at his execution in 1649 , a brooch given as a sentimental gift to @entity144 @entity144 by @entity232 and a sparkling collection of tiaras , including one with pearls ‘ the size of walnuts ’ made for the wedding of @entity110 who in the 1870s was the wealthiest woman in @entity240			1
much of the show focuses on rare , natural pearls from the @entity243			1
@entity244 changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time , and ambassadors since have included @entity248 ( pictured with son @entity249 ) and princess @entity159 @entity25 's @entity227 pendant earrings : ' to find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing			2
she wore them in the film @entity257 , ' said co-curator @entity259 - @entity258 ‘ @entity260 and the other @entity243 states have money and they want to buy their heritage back , ’ says @entity258			2
‘ they now own @entity25 ’s pendant earrings and many other pieces including an eye - popping 1930s @entity266 five - strand graduated pearl necklace			1
' if you think that you need thousands of oysters to find a pearl it ’s no surprise they have been seen as objects of desire through the ages			1
’ the @entity280 wore pearls as items of sheer luxury , while in medieval times they became a @entity286 symbol for purity and chastity , and then in the @entity290 symbols of authority and wealth			2
they were even felt to have medicinal properties – philosopher and statesman @entity294 is said to have taken crushed pearls mixed with lemon juice as an elixir			2
‘ pearls are still given at weddings today and have an association with joy , ’ says @entity258			2
‘ but at the same time they are directly associated with death			0
the classical belief that pearls were created from the teardrops of the gods links them with sadness and tears			2
’ @entity312 : visitors will be able to look at exhibits such as the @entity315 and @entity316 @entity317 and famous : @entity26 with @entity181 wearing her @entity175 necklace , one of the few pieces of fine jewellery she actually owned , and @entity322 's tiara ( right ) , 1878 their cachet has continued into the age of @entity117 and celebrity , helped by the rise of cultivated and imitation pearls			1
@entity244 changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time , and ambassadors since have included @entity248 and princess @entity159			0
‘ what fascinated me is the variety of pearls , the international trade and the worldwide obsession , ’ says @entity258			0
‘ rubies and emeralds have been fashionable at certain times , and even diamonds go in and out of favour , but the appeal of pearls appears to have been continuous through all jewellery history			2
