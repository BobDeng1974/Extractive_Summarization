a radical ‘ artificial egg ’ made from plants is set to go global after the @entity1 firm behind it revealed major backing from @entity4 's richest man			1
made from plants , it can replace eggs in everything from cakes to mayonnaise - without a chicken ever coming close to the production process			2
@entity16 's products are already sold in @entity17 in @entity18 , and now the firm plans to take on the world			1
the results were surprising , if a little anticlimactic			2
both tasted exactly as you would expect - and are indistinguishable from products made with real egg			1
the chocolate chip cookies we tried were excellent - crumbly , moist and with a feel in the mouth identical to a normal cookie			2
crucially , they also look identical to a normal cookie - despite containing no egg			2
@entity16 ’s ‘ @entity47 ’ mayonnaise was also extremely similar to ‘ normal ’ mayo - and after trying it out on a few friends , some even preferred to to normal mayonnaise			1
today that it was announced the firm has landed $ 23 million infunding			1
backers include mr. @entity57 , @entity4 's richest man and @entity60 co-founder @entity59			1
in the last 90 days , the company has also signed partnership agreements with 6 @entity64 companies , including some of the largest food manufactures and retailers in the world - although the firm is keeping their names secret until products go on sale			1
mr. @entity57 , who is estimated to be worth $ 28.8 billion , said he believed the firm had huge potential			1
' technology enables everyone to have more options to better our future together , ' he said			2
' to keep up with all the demands for the growing global population , we need to be more efficient , more environmentally friendly , and have more quality and affordable choices			2
@entity16 ceo and founder @entity82 said , ' we live in a time where the unhealthy choice is dirt cheapand convenient , and the healthy choice is pricey and inconvenient			1
' when my @entity87 walks the grocery aisles to buy mayo or chocolate - chip cookies or eggs , the inputs that make them possible often come from bizarrely unhealthy places			2
' our goal has always been to build a company that brings healthier and affordable food to everyone , everywhere			2
solving a problem means actually solving the problem for most people – not just the folks that can afford to pay $ 5.99 for organic eggs			1
the ' artificial egg ' mayonnaise made from plants is already on sale in @entity18 @entity110 stores ‘ we want to take animals out of the equation , ' @entity82 has previously told @entity27			0
‘ the food industry is begging for innovation , especially where animals are involved - it is a broken industry			0
’ @entity82 ’s idea was to find a mix of easy - to - grow plants that , when mixed together in the right way , replicate the taste , nutritional values and cooking properties of an egg			0
this , he believes will allow the firm to produce its substitute for mass market foods - and to allow developing worlds to grow their own versions with added nutrients			1
‘ eggs are functionally incredible , they do everything from hold oil and water in mayo to making the muffin rise and holding scrambled eggs together , ’ he said ‘ i started to think what if we can find plants that can do this			0
we have about 12 plants pre-selected , including a pea already widely grown in @entity145			0
there ’s also a bean in @entity4 that is incredible in scrambled eggs			0
@entity16 's founders @entity150 ( left ) and @entity82 ( middle ) with mr. @entity57 , worth an estimated $ 28.8 billion			1
the firm is already in talks with major food manufacturers around the world - including several in the @entity156 , to replace eggs in supermarket products with their alternative			1
so far , he says the team has perfected an egg substitute for mayonnaise , and one for cakes			0
' we can make really good mayonnaise , we ’ve done taste tests against market leaders , and beaten them consistently			0
in the world of cookies , we ’ve trialled our products with everyone from @entity172 to @entity173 , both of whom could n’t taste the difference			1
' @entity172 became an advisor to the company , and has been one of its most vocal supporters in the @entity183 world where @entity16 is based			1
' perfect ' : so far the makers claim to have mastered a recipe for cakes and mayonnaise - but are struggling with scrambled eggs ' companies like @entity16 are experimenting with new ways to use heat and pressure to turn plants into foods that look and taste just like meat and eggs , ' he recently wrote of the firm			1
it hopes to allow developing countries to grow and produce their own ‘ plant eggs ’			0
' in developing countries , we can also add in things missing from the local diet , helping nutrient deficiencies , and we have had initial discussion with the world food programme about this			0
' what we want to do eventually is find a way to work with farmers in the developing world to enable them to have new cash crops that can be used			0
then we become the kind of company to be feared by the bad guys in the industry			0
' the team initially struggled to create a product that worked			0
' our first attempts were n’t great , we tried to make a muffin using a mix of plants , ' said @entity16 boss @entity82			1
' ours tasted really gummy , and did n’t have the ‘ bounce ’ we wanted			0
' our mayonnaise would not hold the oil and egg together , so had what looked like liquid syrup			0
scrambled eggs were even worse - they just would n’t congeal at all , and had a really bad aftertaste			0
@entity82 admits the firm is struggling with artificial scrambled egg			2
he says there is a ‘ pretty good ’ recipe , but admits more work is needed			0
' eventually we ’ll get to one thing that will replace everything , ' he said .			0
