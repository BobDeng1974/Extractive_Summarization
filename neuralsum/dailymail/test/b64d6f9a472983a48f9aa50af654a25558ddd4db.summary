from top to third to second to top to second again			2
what a perfect game to represent such an absurd season			2
@entity3 were out of it			1
then they were in it			2
then it all went bonkers and @entity8 was caught between feelings of regret and unhappiness with @entity12 , the referee			2
the stripped - down fact is that it finished 2 - 2			1
the glorious detail is that @entity3 trailed to a @entity16 sucker punch , levelled through @entity17 and then had a man sent off			1
a problem ? not really			0
@entity20 converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for @entity23 at @entity24 @entity20 celebrates his late , late strike as the @entity26 held @entity3 to a draw on their home turf @entity3 : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , ( @entity33 64 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 57 ) , @entity17 ( @entity40 81 ) , @entity41 subs not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 booked : @entity32 red card : @entity30 @entity23 : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 45 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 15 ) , @entity55 , @entity20 , @entity16 , @entity56 ( @entity57 63 ) , @entity58 subs not used : @entity60 , may , @entity61 , bus booked : @entity49 , @entity53 , @entity56 referee : @entity12 attendance : 11,280 @entity35 scored the kind of goal that belongs in the @entity67 to put them in front			1
job done ? not nearly			0
@entity20 scored a penalty for wednesday deep into stoppage time and three point became one ; a big step towards the top flight became a stumble			1
@entity8 was left ' heartbroken ' , but also frustrated , not least because he felt @entity41 deserved a penalty in the second half when he appeared to be fouled by @entity79			2
@entity3 have had 15 penalties this season and @entity8 suggested that might be counting against them , saying in a radio interview : ' it looked like the referees have come together and talked about @entity41 and said do n’t give him any penalties because @entity3 have had too many this season and we don ’ t want them to have any more			1
' his broader disappointment was also clear , having blown a major opportunity to keep top spot in a thrilling division			0
he said : ' it really is tough to take			0
that is why we love the game – the drama and twists and turns			0
' the pain and frustration we need to transfer into motivation			0
this is our most successful season but we have had low moments			0
we have only two games and our objective is clear			0
we have to use this as motivation to move forward now			0
' @entity16 had put wednesday in front with a 36th - minute header before @entity17 levelled midway through the second half			1
a draw at that stage might have seemed fair but @entity30 was sent off for two yellow cards and @entity3 were back on the ropes			1
@entity35 launched a shot into the top corner after @entity37 laid off a free - kick but @entity20 added to the madness in stoppage time			1
wednesday manager @entity124 could n't help but chuckle			2
he said : ' it took six and a half hours to get down here but we got on with it			0
if we left without anything it would have been disappointing			0
' @entity16 ( second right ) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead @entity17 ( second left equalises for the @entity135 with 20 minutes of the contest remaining @entity3 's @entity30 is dismissed by referee @entity12 in the 78th minute @entity35 races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time			1
