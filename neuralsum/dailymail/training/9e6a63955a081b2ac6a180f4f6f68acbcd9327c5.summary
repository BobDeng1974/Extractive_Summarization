by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 13:06 est , 13 november 2012 these incredible before and after aerial pictures show the destruction wreaked by @entity3 on the @entity4 of the @entity5 the shocking before and after photos of the @entity8 and @entity9 shoreline reveal in minute detail how much the land was altered in just a few moments			1
they are part of a large - scale survey of the damage by the @entity17 , which is attempting to analyse the devastation caused to houses , public services and the lives of people from the battered seaside towns			1
construction crews are seen clearing sand from roads and pushing it seaward			0
the yellow arrow pinpoints the same spot in the two images ravaged : in @entity40 , @entity9 - made famous by reality tv show @entity42 - part of the pier and its rollercoaster have been thrown into the ocean			1
sediment deposited on the island is visible in the background at risk : a view of @entity51 , looking northwest across @entity52 , near @entity53 - a very narrow portion of the island that has experienced breaching in previous large storms devastation : the island breached during @entity3 , creating a new inlet			0
despite the breach , the fishing shack ( yellow arrow ) remained standing ' @entity3 taught us yet again that not all @entity65 hurricanes are created equal , ' said @entity17 director @entity66			0
' the superstorm 's enormous fetch over the @entity4 produced storm surge and wave erosion of historic proportions			2
' we have seized this opportunity to gather unique data on a major coastline - altering event			2
' as major storms approach , the @entity17 conducts pre-storm and post-storm flights to gather images along the length of the coastline likely to take the hit of the storm â€™s landfall			0
pictures from these points of impact help scientists understand which areas are likely to undergo the most severe impacts from future storms , and improves future coastal impact forecasting			2
when the project is complete , it will stretch from the @entity93 of @entity94 in the @entity95 to as far north as @entity96			1
ordinary day : @entity97 , @entity52 , @entity8 , looking northwest across the island towards @entity99 changed landscape : @entity101 from the beach and narrow dunes carried sand inland towards the interior and bayside of the island , and numerous houses were destroyed or severely damaged life - altering : @entity40 , looking west along the @entity110 red arrow points to a building that was washed off of its foundation and moved about a block away from its original location @entity17 oceanographer @entity116 said @entity3 caused ' significant beach and dune erosion and minor disruption of infrastructure in the south , to extreme and often catastrophic erosion , overwash and sediment deposition and inundation on northern beaches like @entity27 , @entity9			1
' @entity101 occurs when waves are higher than protective sand dunes , sweeping sand from the beach inland			0
this can wreak havoc on roads and public transport , bury buildings and put lives at risk			0
the photos will help @entity17 identify areas particularly vulnerable to severe coastal change			1
before @entity3 , the service predicted erosion of 91 per cent of the @entity144 coastline , 98 per cent of beaches and dunes in @entity9 and 93 per cent in @entity8			1
it recorded drastic changes on @entity52 in @entity8 , where the beach all but disappeared overnight , seaside homes reduced to matchsticks and 3ft of sand dumped in back gardens			2
@entity17 coastal geologist @entity154 said : ' on average the dunes eroded back 70 feet - the equivalent of 30 years of change			0
' our data also showed that dunes lost as much as 10 feet of elevation			0
' video : before and after : the wake of @entity3 's destruction along the @entity4 video : aerial tour of @entity3 's destruction in @entity167 , @entity9			1

*dramatic* aerial photos show damage caused by superstorm in @entity8 and @entity9
the data will eventually stretch from @entity94 to @entity96
it will help forecasters and *governments* identify and protect vulnerable areas in future
