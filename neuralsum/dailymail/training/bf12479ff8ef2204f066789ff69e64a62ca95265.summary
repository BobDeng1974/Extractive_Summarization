by @entity1 reporter @entity5 players could soon be allowed to use marijuana to treat pain if they are in states where the drug has been legalized for either medical or recreational use , the league 's commissioner said last week			1
currently , marijuana is on a list of banned substances prohibited under the @entity5 's substance abuse program			2
however , the marijuana recently has been legalized for medical and recreational use in a number of states , including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
but because the drug is on the league 's list of banned substances , players living in those states could face consequences from the @entity5 even if they are using the drug legally			0
@entity5 commissioner @entity28 said last week that he was not entirely opposed to allowing @entity5 players to use marijuana in places where it is not illegal ' i do n't know what 's going to develop as far as the next opportunity for medicine to evolve and to help either deal with pain or help deal with injuries but we will continue to support the evolution of medicine , ' @entity5 commissioner @entity31 said in an interview with the @entity43 on january 7			1
marijuana has been approved in several states to treat varying ailments , including chronic pain			0
given the addictive qualities of other pain medications @entity5 players often are given to treat the pain caused by injuries sustained on the field , there is a growing number of people advocating the use of marijuana , which does n't have the same addictive qualities			1
' i would just think that the use of marijuana for pain management , it would be a far better outcome to me than it would be for the abuse of heavy narcotics like pills of [ @entity67 ] or @entity68 or whatever the pill of choice is for pain in the @entity5 , ' 7 - time pro-bowler and @entity59 champion @entity57 said on the @entity72 after @entity31 made his comments about being open to allowing players to use marijuana			2
half : former pro bowler @entity57 says he suspects that as many as 50 percent of @entity5 players currently use marijuana due to the physical demands of playing in the @entity5 , players often suffer painful injuries and are forced to treat the pain with narcotic prescription drugs , on which they can become dependent			1
in 2006 , then - @entity82 receiver @entity81 overdosed on @entity83			0
one player who could benefit tremendously from the @entity5 allowing marijuana to be used to treat pain is @entity88 wide receiver @entity87 , whose chronic migraine headaches have sidelined him at several points throughout his career			1
marijuana , experts say , is highly effective in treating the pain caused by migraine headaches			0
@entity57 adds that he suspects several @entity5 players currently use marijuana			2
pain : much of @entity87 's career has been plagued by migraine headaches , which could be treated by medical marijuana ' the @entity5 , they have to protect their logo , they have to protect their image , but i say at least 50 percent of the players smoke , ' @entity57 says			1
for now , however , marijuana is still a banned substance in the @entity5			2
and despite @entity31 's comments , the league does n't appear to be willing to change that any time soon			0
' the use of medical marijuana is not permitted and the medical advisers to our joint substance abuse program with the @entity117 do not believe it should be permitted , ' a league official said in an emailed statement to the website @entity120 .			0
