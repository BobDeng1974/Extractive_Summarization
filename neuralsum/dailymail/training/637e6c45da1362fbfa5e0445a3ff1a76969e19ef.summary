the @entity0 is today expected to clear the way for controversial ‘ @entity4 ’ crops to be grown in @entity3			1
@entity5 will vote to clear the block on growing controversial genetically modified ( @entity8 ) crops that has effectively stopped commercial cultivation for a decade			2
the new rules will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a @entity8 crop – once it has been ruled safe by @entity13 , which is the @entity15 ’s food safety body			1
the deal has been engineered by the @entity3 government , which wants @entity8 crops to be grown here , following a series of secret briefings with @entity8 companies and their trade body			1
the @entity3 government wants to be able to grow genetically modified crops that are banned in @entity25 countries such as @entity26 and @entity27			1
above , former @entity29 environment secretary @entity28 views a genetically modified crop trial in @entity31 the net effect is that even if a @entity8 crop is banned in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity36 and other @entity25 states , the @entity34 government can allow it to be grown here from as early as next year			1
the conservatives , @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity34 support @entity8 crops , however , the administrations in @entity40 , @entity41 and many @entity43 councils remain opposed			2
there is also concern among consumers amid suspicion the crops pose risks to human health and the environment			0
at the same time , organic farmers and green campaigners point to the damage caused by the growing of @entity8 crops on an industrial scale in @entity62			1
there , superweeds have developed that are difficult to control , leading to the need for ever more powerful chemical weedkillers , while important species like the monarch butterfly are under threat			0
critics fear that pollen from @entity8 plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops , as well as honey , so polluting the entire food chain			2
the first @entity8 crops to be grown here could be varieties of corn or maize created by the labs of @entity83 and @entity84 , which are modified to give them protection from the weedkiller glyphosate , also known as @entity88			2
the idea is that these crops can be blanket sprayed with the chemical which will kills off any weeds but allows the corn to grow			0
advocates of genetically modified crops say that the technology can increase production and nutrition while opponents point to dangers to the environment advocates claim that in the future @entity8 technology could be used to produce more food in areas of drought , or develop plants that are high in beneficial nutrients			1
the new legal regime that is expected to be adopted today is at odds with the principles of the @entity15 and single market , which has previously insisted that all member states should apply the same rules on food and farming			0
despite that , it will be voted through because countries opposed to @entity8 will be able to ban them , while those in favour , such as @entity3 and @entity123 , can go ahead			1
the arrangements have been hailed as a success for the @entity127 campaigner and former @entity29 environment secretary , @entity128 , who was sacked last year			0
he , along with ministers from @entity123 , led the drive in @entity132 to speed the commercial growing of @entity8 crops			1
the policy sprang out of a series of secret briefings between ministers , their civil servants and the @entity8 industry ’s @entity140 , which began in the summer of 2012			0
ministers subsequently promised incentives for investment , a strategy for biotech and , most significantly , efforts to reduce regulation and speed up @entity8 crop approvals , which will come to fruition today			0
the details of these meetings were revealed following a series of @entity154 requests by the campaigning group @entity155			0
its director , dr @entity156 , said : ‘ this @entity15 deal arose from secret meetings between the @entity160 and the @entity8 industry , which wants to plant its @entity8 crops in @entity43 , despite opposition from the public			1
‘ massive environmental problems with these crops in the @entity167 include the devastating loss of 90per cent of @entity170 butterflies and the spread of resistant superweeds , due to blanket spraying of the crops with weedkiller			0
‘ growing @entity8 in @entity43 would risk contamination of non-gm crops , pushing up food prices and risking loss of export markets			2
the @entity40 and @entity41 governments will say no to @entity8 crops , but in @entity43 people will have to fight for local regions to opt out			2
’ @entity185 , the director of @entity186 , said : ‘ contamination incidents all over the world show that seed and pollen will spread wherever the wind , wildlife and human error take them , right along the supply chain			0
‘ this directive offers no meaningful protection to people who want to make informed choices about what they are eating or to farmers who want to protect their fields from the superweeds and biodiversity loss associated with the kind of @entity8 crops likely to be heading our way			0
’ last week , the government ’s new environment secretary @entity208 confirmed her support for @entity8 she told a farming conference in @entity212 : ‘ i think @entity8 crops have a role to play here in @entity3			1
’ however , her counterpart in @entity40 , @entity216 , a member of the @entity217 , said : ‘ the jury is still out on the environmental and scientific case for @entity8 we do n’t want to see @entity8 ruin @entity40 ’s reputation as a clean , green country			0
’ the @entity0 reached a deal on genetically modified crops despite opposition from campaigners after a push from the @entity3 and @entity123 governments			1

rules will allow @entity3 to grow crops banned in other @entity25 states
push for changes led by @entity3 and @entity123 after meetings with @entity8 companies
opponents say the products damage the environment , kill animal species
