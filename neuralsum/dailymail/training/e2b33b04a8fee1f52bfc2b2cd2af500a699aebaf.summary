by @entity1 reporter published : 20:36 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 20:39 est , 13 april 2013 police are handing out on - the - spot tickets - for good behaviour			2
officers in south @entity6 have started dishing out the tickets to children and teenagers they see behaving well on the neighbourhood 's streets			2
the ' positive tickets ' have so far been given out when officers see youths using pedestrian crossings , putting their litter in the bin , riding their bike on the road instead of the pavement or using bike lights at night			1
the scheme is currently being trialled around @entity22 and @entity23 - with the aim of encouraging good behaviour among youngsters			1
so far around 20 tickets have been given out by police officers and @entity28 , with plans to extend it to other areas if successful			1
it is hoped vouchers for activities like the cinema , or to spend in shops , could be given out if a sponsor for the tickets can be found			2
police are handing out on - the - spot tickets for good behaviour and the scheme has been welcomed			1
@entity42 , 21 , served a year in a young offenders ' institute for a violent street robbery and was well - known to police growing up in @entity23			1
@entity42 , who now lives in @entity47 , said : ' i used to think badly of the police and think i was always getting picked on by them			0
i think if they had done something like this scheme when i was younger it might have helped			2
hopefully , it will change other peoples ' opinions of police			0
" but other teenagers were n't so impressed by the scheme			0
@entity61 , 18 , from @entity47 said : ' i have been stopped by the police a couple of times for no reason			0
' when they do , you immediately think you 've done something wrong and are guilty			0
' positive tickets ' can be given out to youths putting their litter in the bin ' this idea might make people think about their actions and encourage good behaviour but maybe there are better ways they could do it , like going into schools			1
" @entity80 , 16 , from @entity81 , said : " i do n't see the point of this , i think it 's a waste of time			0
' people should be putting litter in the bin anyway			1
' it would be good to get to know your local police better , but maybe in another way			0
' sergeant @entity91 , who is based at the @entity93 police station in @entity22 and who came up with the idea , said : ' as police officers and @entity28 , we only ever issue tickets in negative situations , so this is refreshing not only for ourselves , but also for youngsters who get to see a different side to us			1
' when officers first approach people they assume they must have done something wrong , but when we explain the reason for issuing the ticket they are pleasantly surprised and think it 's a great idea			0
' then if we see them again they always acknowledge us			0
' handing out these tickets allows us to engage with young people in a really positive way , and so far they have appreciated us stopping to speak to them			0
' i believe this scheme will help to reinforce positive behaviour , and i plan to extend it by encouraging local businesses to donate items such as cinema tickets and discount vouchers which can be handed out with the tickets			1

the scheme is currently being trialled around @entity22 and @entity23
so far around 20 tickets have been given out
putting litter in the bin can earn *citizens* a *certificate*
