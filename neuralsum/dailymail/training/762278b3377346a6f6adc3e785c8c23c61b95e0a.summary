@entity0 and @entity1 appeared to come to blows in a @entity4 training session on friday , in perhaps the first sign that there is trouble in @entity9 paradise			1
the club are nearing their first @entity12 title , and would take a major step towards it with a win against @entity16 on sunday			2
but there seemed to be a clash between two of their key players at @entity22 , with others stepping in to break it up			0
@entity25 : @entity0 pushes team - mate @entity1 in a @entity4 training session on friday close up : the @entity4 players were playing a game of head and foot volleyball when the incident took place lead up : players are seen laughing at @entity1 doing imitations , but @entity0 is seen scowling at the @entity35 row : the striker clenches his fist towards the defender at @entity22 tempers fray : an eye witness said that @entity1 cheated in the game and @entity0 was n't impressed during a game of head and foot volleyball , players were laughing as @entity1 joked around			1
one man who looks to have taken offence though is @entity0 , who is seen scowling at the @entity35 centre - back			1
@entity0 then seems to clench his fists and raise his arms at @entity1 , and is backed up by team - mates @entity51 and @entity53			1
competitive : the game continued and an eye - witness said that @entity0 's team later won the point hugs : players laugh and joke about the incident , but @entity0 and @entity1 are still kept apart blow : @entity63 is spotted in the background while @entity0 still seems to be arguing his case an eye - witness suggested @entity1 seemed to be mucking about which amused his team - mates , but not @entity0 he used his arm to keep the ball in play , a move which @entity0 and @entity73 objected			1
the former leaned over the net to push @entity1			1
manager @entity63 stepped in to calm the escalating tension and @entity0 's team was awarded the point			1
matters seemed calm soon after			0
heated : @entity51 and other @entity80 and @entity81 have @entity0 's back no anxiety : @entity63 had claimed that his players were loving his life at the top the incident could suggest a contradiction to @entity63 ' quotes from last week , insisting there was no anxiety about the title race at the club			1
