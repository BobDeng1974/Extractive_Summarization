by @entity0 it is one of the biggest markets in the tourist hot spot of @entity5 , @entity6			1
but you wo n't want to face this on an empty stomach			0
from battered snake to spit - roasted bats , the smorgasbord of traditional delicacies on offer are not exactly appetising			1
three - metre - long snakes lie sprawled across the tables of blood - covered carcasses			2
other delights include pickled rats , boar legs , and bite - size bats on sticks			1
and roasted lizards are cut open and displayed on their backs - with their insides on show			2
casual : locals casually survey the bloody carcasses of boars and bats , which are delicacies in the region snack : bite - size black bats are sold on sticks to market - goers , which will make holiday - goers ' stomachs turn controversy : the market is under constant surveillance by the government after selling endangered species graphic : vegetables and spices are sold at the market but the hanging boar legs will stay in tourists ' minds the market , in the northern region of @entity20 , was marred by controversy in 1993 after government inspectors found sellers to be trading babirusa , an endangered type of wild pig			1
despite numerous regulations put in place , it took years to eliminate the trade			0
however , the bizarre market has now become something of a tourist attraction - but few are willing to taste their way through the full menu			1
not far from @entity5 , the @entity85 also attracts a fair few horrified holidaymakers - and families planning their evening meal			2
all in a day 's work : a market seller hacks away at a three - metre - long snake using three different knives portions : the segments are gruesomely displayed on the dirty , tiled worktops for customers to buy stash : one customer has stocked up on roasted rats for this evening 's meal , piling them all into a basket grab - and - go : this man appears to have forgotten a bag - but seems not to mind carrying to wild boars ' legs family day out : a child munches on a treat bought from the traditional market while his family select their meal they casually survey the torched animals - lying frozen with a facial expression of horror - before selecting an entire snake or dog to serve up to the kids later			1

mr @entity122 said : ' in a word , appalling			0
there 's something about the air that changes when there 's that much death around			0
' it hangs heavy and it made me queasy and light - headed at the same time ... it 's the first time i 'd ever encountered anything like it			0
