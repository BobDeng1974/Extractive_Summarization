thank you for all of the support and i look forward to sharing this chapter of my life with you ! ' @entity94 spokesman @entity93 said : ' she 's quite far along in her pregnancy so there ca n't really be any problem with it , and if she 's always done weightlifting i do n't think it would suddenly bring on early labour			0
' obviously we are n't advising pregnant women to take up weightlifting if they 've never done it before , but if she 's used to the exercise it 's ok			0
' we always say if women were riding bikes or going to the gym before they were pregnant they can continue to do so , they just need to tell their instructor they are pregnant and then they can adjust the exercises			0

doctors always strongly suggest to not lift heavy because you can sever your placenta and cause major damage an early labour and miscarriage ... posting this picture goes people the wrong message that this is okay when it 's not !

' she is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements			2
this is not a proud picture to post			0
' that amount of weight lifted above the head is extremely dangerous while pregnant			0

' users who sprang to her defence included @entity165 , who wrote : ' you go girl ! looking great ! ! ! much better than a lot of obese pregnant ladies with high blood pressure and diabetes who get short of breath walking up a flight of steps			0
' controversial : @entity16 - @entity3 provoked debate when she posted photos of herself lifting weights body - building : ms @entity3 was pictured lifting heavy kettlebells above her head just weeks before she was due ms @entity3 is not the only workout - loving mother - to - be to make headlines after her pregnancy regime came to light			1
four years ago @entity188 fitness enthusiast @entity186 hit the front pages after being pictured lifting 15kg dumbbells with just 11 days to go before her due date			1
the @entity5 bodybuilder is a devotee of the @entity33 training regime another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model @entity197 , who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant			1
speaking to @entity201 after the marathon in november last year , @entity197 said : ' when i tell people i 'm still exercising , they react as if i 've told them i 've been smoking or drinking alcohol while pregnant			2
' but what i 'm doing is actually good for me and my baby			2
' @entity197 's belief that fitness aids labour is backed up by studies that have found that babies of women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because ' foetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers , ' according to the @entity221 ( @entity221 )			1
along with official @entity223 guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for expectant mothers , the @entity221 also advocates exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy			0
precautions like not exercising at a high intensity or running when it is too hot should also be taken			2
the @entity221 guidelines said : ' in most cases , exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue exercise to derive the health benefits associated with such activities			2
' they add that it is untrue that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or damage to an unborn baby			2
the guidelines add : ' additionally , active women experience less insomnia , stress , anxiety and depression			0
' alternative : the home birth was not the only unorthodox part of the @entity5 bodybuilder 's pregnancy healthy : ms @entity3 kept her thousands of @entity70 fans updated throughout her pregnancy with baby @entity10			1

@entity16 - @entity3 , *35* , sparked outrage after posting the photos on @entity70
the @entity5 fitness fanatic was branded ' selfish ' by some commenters
but the mother - of - two kept exercising until three days before the birth
she had a home birth for baby @entity10 who she says is ' a very chill dude '
