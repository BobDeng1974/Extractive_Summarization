by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 08:02 est , 14 august 2013 row : @entity1 , chief executive of @entity2 and @entity3 , has taken a 20 % pay rise despite being placed in special measures the chairman of a failing hospital trust due to be taken over by an @entity9 ' hit squad ' said today it would have been a ' grave mistake and a false economy ' not to boost the chief executive 's salary by £ 25,000			1
@entity1 is in charge of @entity2 and @entity15 , which was put in special measures last month after a major national review of high mortality rates			1
yet she received the inflation - busting rise from £ 145,000 to £ 170,000 in april last year			2
that increase makes her paid £ 27,500 more than the prime minister , whose salary is £ 142,500			0
last month health secretary @entity23 announced the trust , which serves a population of 358,000 people from three main sites in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , was one of 11 to be placed in special measures following the @entity33 into high mortality rates			1
the critical review found : a lack of clinical changes being made to improve care ; ambulance staff were caring for patients in some cases at the @entity42 department at @entity43 ; concerns over staffing levels and skills ; and that the trust was breaching national standards on mixed sex wards			2
but @entity51 , national grassroots co-ordinator of the @entity52 ’ @entity50 , said the revelation ' adds insult to injury ' following the findings of the @entity58 review			1
' mrs @entity1 has been rewarded handsomely for failure - there is not other way to describe it			1
' despite her assurances that patient safety and quality of care is always her top priority , it appears pocketing masive pay rises has been at the top of her list			2
' i ca n’t see how local residents can have any confidence in her , ' he said			0
scandal : the @entity77 in @entity28 is one of the hospitals due to be taken over by an @entity9 hit squad over mortality rates , which is run by @entity1 nevertheless , mrs @entity1 's pay increase was justified , the trust chairman felt			1
a cash - strapped council has been blasted after all 44 councillors voted for a nine per cent pay rise - while workers will receive just a one per cent wage increase			1
the controversial deal will see @entity91 leader @entity90 receive an extra £ 4,000 bringing his pay packet to £ 48,000			2
councillors ’ pay will increase by £ 1,000 to £ 12,000 , while cabinet members will enjoy a £ 2,000 rise to give them £ 24,000			1
members voted against immediately accepting the increase last year as council staff were subject to a pay freeze			2
but the ruling @entity102 group agreed on the nine per cent rise at a private meeting this week because employees have since accepted their own one per cent rise			2
deputy leader @entity108 , whose allowance will rise by £ 2,500 to £ 30,000 , defending the decision			0
the @entity102 councillor said : ' these rates are set by an independent panel			0
the councillors have not given that rise to themselves			0
' council worker @entity116 , 45 , said : ' it is disgusting that councillors are giving themselves such a bumper pay rise while the rest of us see our salaries pretty much stay the same '			1
dr @entity123 said : ' the remuneration committee is responsible for agreeing the executive management team 's salary bands and uses a national system to determine its decisions on pay			0
' the bands are reviewed every year and a variety of factors are taken into account , such as comparative salaries in the @entity9 , individual performance and market forces			0
' the executive salaries at this trust are either in line with or below those at similar trusts			0
' it is important that we pay salaries which are commensurate with the job to attract and retain high calibre people			1
' @entity1 's starting salary in 2010 was set below the agreed rate as it was her first chief executive post , and she declined a pay rise after her first year in the role			1
' she is now receiving a salary that is roughly in line with the average for trusts of this size and type			0
' the remuneration committee always strives to keep a balance between competitive pay and the need for financial restraint in what are challenging times and i fully believe we have achieved that			0
' it would be a grave mistake and false economy to pay so far below the market rate that executives leave their posts or are impossible to recruit			1
' members of the remuneration committee whose salaries are being discussed by the committee do not participate in these discussions , the trust said			0
the chief executive joined in autumn 2010 on a salary of £ 145,000 , she declined a rise in 2011 and it was increased to £ 170,000 in april last year in line with similar roles , a trust spokeswoman said .			0

chairman claims it *'d* be a ' grave mistake ' not to pay @entity1 more
critics say 20 % rise is a ' reward for failure ' and ' adds insult to injury '
