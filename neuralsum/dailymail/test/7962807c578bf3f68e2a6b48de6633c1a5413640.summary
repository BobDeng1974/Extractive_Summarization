it is march , for goodness sake			0
your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace			0
' it looks like a state			0
it sticks out like a sore thumb			0
i do n't want to keep driving past this eyesore , every time i do , my kids scream			2
i know you live in a council house , but there 's no need to make it look like one			0
' the letter finished ' yours sincerely , a very disgruntled citizen			2

this will happen throughout april for @entity10			2
' that was always my plan and it 's why , back in january , i decided not to take them down because i knew i would be putting them up again in april			0
' i would have taken the lights down after april but now i 'm going to leave them on the house out of principle , but i wo n't be turning them on again until december 2			2

' we are all human beings and the only difference is they have bought their pile of bricks and i rent mine			0
' he says his nearest neighbours support him in his idea to raise awareness of charities			1
