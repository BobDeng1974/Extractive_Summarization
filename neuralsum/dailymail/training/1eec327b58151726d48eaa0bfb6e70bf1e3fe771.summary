@entity0 finally wilted to the star power of @entity2 as @entity3 and @entity5 's late strikes kept the @entity7 holders in touch with leaders @entity10			1
after coming close throughout the match , it appeared @entity0 would pull off a miraculous draw but @entity3 's delicate left - footed finish in the 82nd minutes set them on their way for the away win			1
@entity5 put the result beyond doubt six minutes later with an emphatic blast passed @entity0 keeper @entity19			1
@entity21 's @entity20 was at @entity22 and assesses all the players ' performances			0
@entity5 celebrates blasting home the second goal in @entity2 's 2 - 0 win over @entity0 ( from left ) @entity3 , @entity28 and @entity5 celebrate @entity3 's opener in the 82nd minute @entity0 @entity19 - a couple of absolutely brilliant saves followed by some more			1
there looked to have been no beating the @entity34			0
composed goalkeeper who is always talking to his back four			0
8 @entity0 's @entity34 keeper @entity19 dives in vain as a @entity2 shot clatters into the post @entity41 - absolutely abysmal in possession			1
failed to find a claret shirt all night			0
perhaps a one - off , because @entity41 has started the season relatively well			2
5 @entity45 of a centre - half and gave @entity47 a real game			2
strong in the air and was n’t turned on too many occasions			0
6.5 @entity51 early block on @entity3 - always puts his body on the line for the cause			1
did so again when @entity47 bore down on goal with a stunning last ditch tackle			0
7 @entity58 - got forward to decent effect and got tight to @entity60 on @entity2 ’s right			1
one of his better games for @entity0			2
6.5 @entity64 - has his old swagger back , encapsulated with a 50 - yard drive through midfield before firing wide just outside the box			2
6.5 @entity0 's @entity69 ( left ) had his swagger back and proved a handful for @entity2 @entity72 , as ever			1
puts himself about - exactly what @entity0 need - and is a real driving force			1
change of pace in midfield urged the hosts on			0
7 @entity80 rather passed @entity81 by			0
sitting in front of the back four , he could only watch as @entity5 , @entity28 and the rest found too much space in the area he patrolled			2
5 @entity0 and @entity87 's @entity72 times his tackle on @entity88 to perfection @entity90 - was quoted in saturday ’s papers saying he ’s enjoying his football again , but needs to start performing regularly			1
quickness of thought has n’t come back yet			0
5.5 @entity95 - very narrow to begin with - obviously a ploy by the hosts - and got involved to good effect			0
should have scored just after half - time			0
7 former @entity99 midfielder @entity90 battles with @entity47 @entity101 - a late replacement for @entity102 , who was taken ill in the warm - up , and led the line alone			2
could n’t manufacture any meaningful opportunities			0
6 substitutes @entity107 ( on for @entity101 after 61 minutes ) - an aggressive arm round the neck from manager @entity110 as he entered the fray , @entity107 was bang up for it			1
6.5 @entity113 ( on for @entity95 after 71 minutes ) @entity114 ( on for @entity69 after 71 minutes ) subs ( not used ) : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 @entity101 ( left ) makes way as @entity107 comes on for his long - awaited return for @entity0 @entity2 @entity122 - did n’t have an awful lot to do , but made a decent stop to deny @entity95			1
6 @entity2 keeper @entity122 barks orders to his defenders at @entity22 on saturday @entity127 - was unusually subdued in leaving his station at right back but is ever dependable going the other way			1
6.5 @entity127 makes a desperate lunge as @entity0 's @entity95 shapes to shoot @entity133 - @entity132 effort smashed the post in the opening 10 minutes			1
wicked delivery from the left as ever and almost crossed for @entity5 to score			2
7 @entity137 - caught out by @entity72 out on the right which almost gave @entity0 the lead			1
won his headers and stood firm , as you ’d expect			0
6.5 @entity2 skipper @entity137 plays the ball out from the back @entity145 - perhaps not his fault , but the central defender has an air of nervousness around him when on the ball			1
did nothing wrong , which will come as a huge relief after @entity153			0
7 @entity60 - failed to really get at @entity58 as he should have done			0
a couple of whipped crosses to spark danger			0
6.5 @entity157 as ever , @entity60 ( left ) tries to get position on @entity81 @entity88 - @entity159 performance			0
@entity161 needs to sort out who ’s going to play alongside @entity3			2
5.5 @entity3 - another strange one			1
looked alive in flashes but then failed to deliver ... all before a storming run and finish set @entity2 on their way to three points			2
7 @entity168 around the box			0
did n’t have much help in opening @entity0 up but was a constant threat			2
7 @entity28 is first to the ball as @entity81 gets in tight - the @entity174 was electric around the box @entity176 wasteful in front of goal and flashed a presentable opportunity wide			0
6 @entity5 - struck a post just after the break when he ought to have opened the scoring , but a constant threat in behind			1
fabulous effort in the dying moments that zipped past @entity19			2
7.5 @entity5 was a constant threat and got his reward with @entity2 's second goal with an emphatic finish substitutes @entity192 ( on for @entity88 after 56 minutes ) - added urgency into the @entity2 midfield and is proving to be a very shrewd piece of business by the champions			1
6.5 @entity198 ( on for @entity47 after 64 minutes ) - came on in order to push both @entity192 and @entity3 further forward			1
6 @entity200 ( on for @entity28 after 84 minutes ) - on too late to make an impact			0
subs ( not used ) : @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206			0

under - fire midfielder @entity3 opened the scoring in the 82nd minute
@entity2 striker @entity5 doubled the lead in the 88th minute
@entity0 keeper @entity19 was the star player with some *impressive* saves
@entity0 striker @entity107 returned after seven - *months* out
