@entity5 , who had previously dismissed the expenses scandal ‘ as a wonderful moment of @entity16 fiddling ’ , said ‘ @entity18 ’ as his sentence was announced			1
the one - time @entity20 journalist then muttered ‘ quelle surprise ’ as he was led from the dock			1
@entity5 , 65 , had admitted faking 19 invoices for ‘ research and translation services ’ amounting to £ 12,900 between 2005 and 2008			1
he submitted them through a company that he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think the paperwork had been filled in by others			1
a minister for @entity12 under @entity35 , @entity5 used the money to fund trips to the @entity38 , including one to judge a literary competition in @entity40			1
jailing him , mr @entity41 said his ‘ considerable and repeated ’ dishonesty had ‘ reduced confidence in our priceless democratic system ’			2
‘ there was deliberate , oft repeated and prolonged dishonesty over a period of years – involving a flagrant breach of trust and consequent damage to @entity52 , ’ he said			0
‘ you were an mp – and a minister at the time of four of the claims – and knew that you were required to act with probity and transparency in the making of expenses claims			2
you deliberately created misleading and deceptive invoices and then used them in order to procure payments of public money			0
’ mr @entity41 said the deception was calculated to avoid suspicion falling on his claims before adding : ‘ you have no one to blame but yourself			0
’ parliamentary authorities began looking at @entity71 ’s claims in 2009 when the expenses scandal engulfed @entity73			0
@entity74 , the @entity75 ’ standards commissioner , raised concerns over claims for ‘ translation services ’ from the @entity79 – a think - tank that he founded			1
@entity5 first admitted to officials that he had submitted invoices signed with what he called ‘ a nom de plume ’ and described the @entity79 as a ‘ convenient vehicle ’ to fund research trips to the continent			1
but a subsequent investigation by the @entity75 ’ @entity89 described his actions as the ‘ gravest case which has come to us for adjudication , rather than being dealt with under the criminal law ’			0
it recommended that @entity5 should be suspended as an mp for 12 months but he resigned as the member for @entity97 in november 2012 before the punishment could be imposed			0
sentence : @entity5 , pictured arriving at the @entity100 today , will serve six months in prison ' cheers , quelle surprise ' : @entity71 outside court			1
one former @entity9 colleague sprang to his defence police , who had dropped an investigation in 2009 , reopened their inquiry and @entity5 was charged in may			0
he was the sixth mp to be prosecuted over expenses and admitted false accounting at the @entity100 last month			1
notably absent from court was his girlfriend , @entity114 , 61 , the ex-wife of liberal democrat @entity115			0
she was released in may after serving two months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been picked up by @entity115 , the former energy secretary , who was also jailed			0
@entity5 is expected to serve half his sentence before being released			2
the invoices were signed by @entity5 under the name of @entity124 , the general manager of the company based at an address in @entity127 , south - west @entity128			2
in power : @entity5 , pictured in 2002 with then foreign secretary @entity130 , served as @entity12 minister under @entity35 parliamentary authorities began looking at @entity71 's claims in 2009 when the @entity135 ' expenses scandal engulfed @entity73			1
he was referred to @entity136 within months			0
however , due to parliamentary privilege , officers were unable to access damning evidence in which @entity5 detailed how signatures on receipts from the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) had been faked			2
it was not until after police dropped the case last year that the cross-party standards committee published the evidence in a report that recommended an unprecedented 12 - month suspension from the @entity149			1
@entity5 , who served as @entity12 minister under @entity35 , resigned as mp for @entity97 last november before his suspension could be imposed			1
he accepted that he made a ' grotesque mistake ' , but argued there was no personal gain from the claims			0
the @entity156 - born politician , who was elected as an mp in 1994 , was the sixth mp to face court proceedings over the expenses scandal that rocked @entity73			2
@entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity162 were locked up in 2011 for fiddling their expenses - all four men have now been released from prison			1
resigned : @entity5 , pictured outside an earlier hearing , quit as an mp in teh wake of the allegations grief : @entity5 's ex-partner @entity171 , left , and their daughter @entity173 , right , both died in the past decade @entity174 , who fiddled £ 53,000 in the worst case of dishonesty in the scandal , was let off with a two - year supervision and treatment order last december after claims she was suffering from mental illness			2
between them they claimed around £ 127,000 , of which former environment minister @entity159 admitted to claiming more than £ 30,000			1
two @entity186 peers , lord @entity187 and @entity188 , were jailed for cheating the taxpayer of around £ 25,000			0
a fellow @entity9 mp argued that it was wrong to jail @entity71 because he has already ' been punished enough ' for his fraud and did not personally profit from the false claims			2
@entity194 , a former transport minister , said : ' everyone accepts - the cps and the police accept - that @entity5 did not personally gain from his behaviour			1
' he admits that he was wrong and i think there was a very strong case for a non-custodial sentence			2
i think it is very disappointing that the judge decided to treat him as mps who had gained personally from their fraudulent activities			0
' @entity5 is not in the same category			0
he made no personal gain			0
he has been punished enough			0
he was forced out of @entity52 , he had to give up his seat and i think he has suffered enough			0
