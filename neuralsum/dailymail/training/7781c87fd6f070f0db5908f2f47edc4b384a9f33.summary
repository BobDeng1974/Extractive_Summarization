as police in the @entity34 town detained @entity7 , she allegedly said : ‘ he ’s a f * * * * * * d * * *			1
he ’s stabbed me so i took the knife off him and stabbed him ( in ) self - defence			0
he could have killed me			0
he could have definitely killed my fiancé			0
he broke into my address			0
i did n’t do it on purpose			0
’ mr @entity9 , a former former friend of @entity41 , suffered a fatal knife wound near his left armpit which penetrated his lung - and he died in hospital 45 minutes later despite attempts to save him			1
@entity47 heard @entity7 - who was living with her fiancé @entity48 and two other friends - had fallen out with mr @entity9 and the group had moved house to get away from him			1
she claimed she had ‘ loads of trouble ’ with the teenager - alleging he had stalked her , robbed her and tried to rape her			0
in the run up to the killing , @entity41 sent three messages on her mobile phone			0
the last of these , to her father , read : ‘ here ’s an interesting fact , you come into my house when i ’ve told you not to and i ’m in the @entity62 [ sic ] marks on myself and i can legally kill you			2
’ the killing took place last september after mr @entity9 arrived at @entity7 ’s home with his dog @entity72 after she and two housemates had been smoking the legal high drug ‘ @entity75 , ’ it was said			1
fatality : mr @entity9 ( right ) , a former former friend of @entity41 ( left ; and together , right ) , suffered a fatal knife wound near his left armpit which penetrated his lung - and he died in hospital 45 minutes later mr @entity9 was said be ‘ extremely agitated and irate ’ and one of @entity7 ’s housemates @entity84 claimed the teenager was ‘ provoking ’ the dog into barking and growling			1
he was shouting up at a bedroom window demanding to speak to mr @entity48 and saying : ‘ i ’ll ( let ) the dog have every one of you			2
’ @entity41 went downstairs and opened the front door but as the dog ran into the property she came back saying : ‘ he tried to stab me - i think i ’ve stabbed him			1
’ @entity93 , prosecuting , told the jury : ‘ she showed a small mark on one of her arms and was saying : " i had to take the knife off him because he ’s mental "			2
‘ but @entity9 never had a knife , he did not try to stab the defendant and he caused her no injury to her arm			1
the defendant was lying about all these matters within a short time of her having plunged the knife into @entity9 ’s chest			1
‘ it was a knife she had armed herself with from somewhere in the house before she went to confront @entity9			1
‘ the marks and scratches were self - inflicted by the defendant in the moments before the police arrived to cause them to falsely believe that @entity9 was the aggressor with the knife - when in fact the truth was just the opposite			1
trial : @entity47 ( above ) heard @entity7 - who was living with her fiancé @entity48 and two other friends - had fallen out with mr @entity9 and the group had moved house to get away with him ‘ the idea that a few marks on her would justify her in killing someone who had come into her house was not something that had just occurred to her that night			1
‘ she had previously spoken about this is messages which police extracted from her mobile phone			0
on the night of the killing , she was quick to make some marks on her skin so as to be able to justify to the police her right to attack him			0
‘ you will probably conclude @entity9 was not welcome that night , but nothing that he did justified the defendant in arming herself with the knife and plunging ( it ) into his body			2
’ in a statement to police mr @entity48 - known as ‘ @entity144 ’ - had claimed mr @entity9 had been holding the dog by its collar with a chain wrapped around his knuckles			1
he claimed he went to speak to mr @entity150 but had been threatened with the chain before the teenager attempted to barge past him into the house			2
mr @entity48 fled upstairs only to hear a female shout : ‘ he ’s got a knife			2
’ moments later mr @entity9 was heard shouting : ‘ you just stabbed me ’ before being seen stumbling backwards down the front path and collapsing			1
the court heard in a 999 call minutes before the stabbing , @entity7 told an operator : ‘ i need police			1
' there ’s a lad here with a knife and he ’s kicking off , he ’s banging on the door , he ’s got a vicious dog with him , he ’s taken it off , he ’s whacking the chain with him , he ’s threatening to beat my friend up			1
’ in a second 999 call she added : ' he ’s got an @entity174 pitbull with him - an illegal dog - and he ’s threatening to use it			2
’ held : @entity7 was said to have made a number of ‘ unsolicited comments ’ to police as she was questioned she then handed over the phone to mr @entity84 before being overheard saying : ‘ no matt , f * * * * * * sort it out now , do n’t just f * * * * * * stand there talking			2
’ the call ended when the victim was heard screaming : ‘ help me , help me , i ’ve been stabbed			0
’ mr @entity185 said @entity7 made a number of ‘ unsolicited comments ’ to police as she was questioned			2
at a police station she said : ‘ the things you ’ll do for people - you get arrested for self defence ’ and she said she hoped mr @entity9 would be ‘ getting arrested when he comes of out of hospital ’			1
when told she was being held for murder , @entity7 retorted : ‘ he ’s died ? ' she added : ‘ i stabbed him			2
if i did n’t it would have been me or my boyfriend			0
i did it , yeah , but he came into the house			0
it was unlocked and he had an illegal dog			0
‘ what if it was me or @entity203 ? i heard the door smash			0
i went down and he had a knife in his hand			0
@entity208 was holding his wrist			0
i grabbed hold of his hand and tried to get the knife and it went in			2
if i intended to kill him , i would have stabbed him in the heart			0
’ she also showed a superficial scratch on her left forearm to a nurse who examined her and said : ‘ that ’s what happened when i tried to get the knife off @entity219			0
’ she later gave a no comment interview but issued a prepared statement through her lawyer			0
the knife was found in a garden next door			0
