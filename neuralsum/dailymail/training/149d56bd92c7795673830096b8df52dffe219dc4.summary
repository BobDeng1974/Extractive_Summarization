by @entity1 reporter published : 06:18 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 06:34 est , 5 october 2012 with its bizarrely articulated long neck , this odd - looking creature almost looks like something out of the twisted imagination of @entity7 creator @entity6			1
but it is actually a real insect , native to @entity10 , and it is known as a giraffe weevil			1
from its long legs to smaller body the unusual shaped critter is a surreal echo of its much larger namesake			2
unbe - weevil - ble : the incredible giraffe weevil of @entity10 which , with it 's long articulated neck , looks almost like something from the imagination of @entity23 surrealist painter @entity6 peering about : unlike the giraffe the bug 's neck is not to help it reach for food but is for aggressive combat with other giraffe weevils to win over a female but unlike the giraffe the bug 's neck is not to help it reach for food but is for aggressive combat with other giraffe weevils to win over a female			1
the necks of the males are typically two to three times the length of those of females , and are also used for nest building			2
most of the creatures ' bodies are covered with a distinctive red shell covering the wings			2
despite their fierce look , they are not dangerous to humans			2
though it is not listed as threatened or endangered not much is known about the giraffe weevil , which was only discovered in @entity10 in 2008			1
this specimen was photographed by @entity52 wildlife photographer @entity51 , 29 , who could n't believe his eyes when he spotted it on a leaf while in the @entity57 island nation			0

despite their fierce look , they are not dangerous to humans @entity10 split from @entity67 around 88million years ago , allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation			1
consequently , @entity10 is a biodiversity hotspot ; over 90 per cent of its wildlife is found nowhere else on @entity74			1
however , the island 's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population			0
' i like photographing animals as despite being one of the hardest to capture they are still the most fascinating , ' he said			0
' and this is the strangest insect i have ever seen			0
the giraffe weevil is not considered to be endangered but not much known about it			0
' the enormous neck is two to three times longer in males than in females and is used for fighting			1
they also have red bodies to warn off competition			0
' even though they look like they could bite they are not harmful to humans as they only eat leaves			0
' i do n't think i 'll ever see another bug this strange so i was really pleased to photograph it			0

the long , articulated neck is used by males to fight for mates
native only to @entity10 and their *conservation* *status* is as yet unknown
