@entity0 hosted a media stable visit on thursday at his @entity3 yard in @entity4 and said he could not be happier with favourite for the @entity7 's @entity6 , @entity8			1
he trains @entity9 for his principal patron @entity10 , who owns @entity3 and retains @entity11 , the record - breaking jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys ' championship and retire			1
@entity11 has not decided yet whether he is riding @entity14 in the Â£ 1million @entity7 's @entity6 at @entity15 on april 11 , but everything points to him doing so			1
@entity0 hopes jockey @entity11 rides @entity9 to @entity6 success later this month @entity0 told @entity18 : ' @entity14 is in great form			1
i could not be happier with him			2
i would have liked to have got a run into him ( before the @entity6 ) but he had an abscess on his sinus in january / february time which took a while to find out where it was			1
' we did think about giving him at run at @entity31 ( at the @entity32 in march ) but decided not to			2
i think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly i did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he was n't as well as he is now			2
he is schooling well and is spot on			2
' he is a clean - winded horse , who is not hard to get ready			2
he was ready to run and win first time out at @entity39			0
he is going to @entity15 fresh and well			1
it is all down to @entity42 now if he is going ride him			2
' you need to have a good classy horse for the @entity6			1
before , you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck , now it is a proper race			2
@entity15 has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class			1
' he likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan			0
if he got luck in running over the first mile , i would ride him myself			2
' i do n't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - i am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at @entity66 or whatever ! this year 's @entity6 will be @entity11 's last - ever at @entity15 before his retirement at the end of the season ' hopefully , @entity42 is going to ride @entity9 and the public will want to back him , looking for a fairytale story			1
we would all love that to happen , but it is a tall order			0
' the only pressure ( on me ) is that @entity9 gets there safe and sound			1
he is in the best form i can possibly get him			0
i would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in january and february			0
if he does n't win , we can blame whoever rides him ! ' i 'd love good ground at @entity15 - he is a well - balanced horse and a great mover			1
he does not want it too soft			0
perfect jumping ground is ideal			0
they make a good job of the ground at @entity15 - we just do n't want the heavens to open			1
he is as good as any horse in the @entity6			1
' we are going there full of confidence , but you have got to be realistic - it is the @entity6			1
' do n't push it gave @entity0 , @entity10 and @entity11 their first @entity6 victory in 2010			1
@entity0 continued : ' this preparation has gone better than do n't push it 's			1
do n't push it was a bit of a law unto himself			0
@entity102 has done all the work with this horse , like he did with do n't push it			0
we think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone			0
@entity9 , pictured with @entity0 ( right ) is the favourite for the race on april 11 ' @entity14 is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing , while the other horse was half - mad , a character			1
' he lacks experience as a jumper but i think he is quite clever , pretty accurate and knows what he is doing			0
if he does take to the fences , he will run a blinder			0
' i have taken him away ( to racecourses ) a couple of times so he is not too fresh			0
i do n't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences			0
i used to build three or four national fences every year but one year we did n't and that was the year do n't push it won so we have n't since			0
the @entity6 fences are now really inviting			1
' the @entity6 grips you and is magic to be involved in			1
' we will miss @entity42 not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved			0
we are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling			0
' @entity0 envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at @entity15 during the three days of the @entity7 's @entity32 ( april 9 - 11 )			1
' @entity142 will run in the @entity143 ( april 9 ) after a great run ( fourth ) in the @entity145			2
he was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit			0
he put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home			0
' he came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [ wednesday ] morning			2
he came alive there last year and seems to like the track			0

@entity7 's @entity6 takes place at @entity15 on april 11
@entity9 , trained by @entity0 , is the race favourite
@entity11 is expected to ride @entity9 at @entity15
