a trip that started with @entity1 singing @entity3 ’s praises ended with a similar theme as @entity6 ’s under - 21s extended their winning spree			1
before jetting out to @entity8 and @entity9 last thursday , @entity1 had spoken about how impressed he had been to see @entity3 knuckle down after a dip at the end of last season to recapture the sparkle he emerged 12 months ago			2
those words were not misplaced			0
@entity3 ensured @entity6 did what @entity1 wanted , scoring twice in a 3 - 0 win over @entity9 that secured an eighth consecutive win for their head coach and give him confidence ahead of friday ’s draw for the @entity24 play - offs			1
control : @entity3 was the star of the show in @entity9 for @entity27 as he bagged a brace celebration : the @entity31 striker receives the plaudits for bagging twice in the 3 - 0 win over @entity34 well done , @entity3 ! @entity36 's @entity35 approaches his @entity31 counterpart after the first goal congrats : @entity3 put @entity6 en route to an important win with two goals during the @entity27 clash in @entity44 @entity9 @entity27 : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , @entity58 subs : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 bookings : @entity48 , @entity50 , @entity47 goals : none @entity27 : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , @entity76 , @entity3 ( @entity77 ) , @entity78 subs : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 bookings : none goals : @entity3 ( 16 , 52 ) , @entity78 ( 85 ) referee : @entity87 ( @entity88 ) attendance : 1,000 man of the match : @entity3 with @entity78 completing the scoring , it was a satisfactory night and it was fitting @entity3 was the key man			1
@entity1 ’s first match in charge of the under - 21s last september – against @entity9 – was settled by a goal from the @entity31 striker , so who better to bookend the campaign in @entity101 ? @entity1 , understandably , sported a content smile at the final whistle but there will be no standing back and admiring the job : dangers lurk in the play - offs and they will have to step up another level if they are to ensure this colourful journey ends in the @entity111 next june			1
games in this tournament often throw up unusual experiences but it going to be a while before @entity1 ’s squad sample another coach ride like the one that took them from @entity121 , where their base had been , into the heart of @entity125 , 43 bumpy miles away			0
aside from the many goats and cows that were casually grazing on the grass verge of a three - lane highway , they then had to cross a border patrol – complete with armed soldiers standing guard – to get into one of @entity136 ’s last communist outposts			0
the unusual journey had no effect on the way @entity6 began the contest			0
@entity1 made five changes to the side that had been successful in @entity8 last friday but those selected kept to the passing principles that their head coach is has been determined to implement			0
@entity147 : @entity78 challenges for the ball during the @entity27 showdown between @entity9 and the @entity150 looking on : @entity35 collects a loose ball during the @entity136 @entity152 in @entity9 with @entity153 ’s @entity73 , who was captain for the night in place of the rested @entity155 , pulling the strings alongside @entity157 and @entity76 , @entity6 were on the front foot from an early stage			1
@entity9 had not conceded a goal at home in four games during this qualification campaign but , within 16 minutes , that record had been shattered as @entity3 , who had a shot blocked moments before , rose to turn @entity35 ’s cross beyond @entity45 ’s reach			2
given how briskly @entity6 had started , with @entity35 and @entity3 darting down the flanks and confusing the @entity9 by switching positions with one another , it was a surprise that they did not add to their lead before the interval			2
sitting comfortably , @entity1 ? @entity1 looks on during the clash between @entity34 and @entity27 emerging : @entity6 took on @entity9 and comfortably won in the @entity177 qualifying match if anything , there were guilty of a little complacency , as two moments of hesitation in defence allowed , first , @entity52 then @entity58 to fire shots at @entity66 ’s goal that forced the @entity6 keeper to take action			1
but as was the case in @entity8 , @entity6 stepped things up in the second period and they got breathing space in the 51st minute when @entity78 supplied an inch - perfect ball to @entity3 , who confidently did the rest , rolling his effort into the far corner of @entity45 ’s goal			1
two almost became three in the next attack but , this time , @entity3 ’s lob was too high after he had been sent scurrying away by @entity78 again			0
@entity3 had another attempt shortly after but @entity45 was equal to it , as he was when @entity78 unleashed a thumping effort from 18 yards			0
@entity78 , however , would not be denied and having scored the winner against @entity8 , he finally got in on the act in the 84th minute , thrashing an angled drive past @entity45			0
it will only be fully complete , though , if their winning run includes the play - offs			2
well earned : @entity6 emerged 3 - 0 winners in the clash as @entity1 's men ran riot in @entity9 trained up : @entity6 's youngsters were put through their paces ahead of the match against @entity34			1

@entity6 's 3 - 0 *hammering* is @entity1 's eighth consecutive win
@entity3 double put @entity150 en route to win in @entity9 before @entity78 strike five minutes from time sealed the important *victory*
a brace from the @entity31 striker *helped* sink the @entity34 side
@entity230 starlet adds one of his own for @entity1 's youngsters
@entity6 's @entity235 easily win @entity237 qualifier ahead of draw for the @entity24 play - offs on friday
