by @entity0 i ’ve always loved an adventure , be it back - packing around @entity4 when i was six , exploring the @entity5 , or walking through rainforest to reach @entity8 temples			1
exploring the world and experiencing new things makes me feel alive			0
space would be the ultimate adventure - a chance to look back on our fragile planet and be part of the next phase of explorers			1
many children dream of being astronauts , but the reality of space seems so far away			2
they get written off as dreamers , but what ’s wrong with aiming for the stars ? dream : @entity0 poses in front of one of the @entity30 space shuttles during a visit to the @entity32 hero : @entity0 gets to know @entity34 , the second person ever to set foot on the moon you might think that i ’m crazy for trying to get to space , but if i make it a reality i ’m really excited about sharing the adventure with others			1
if you ’d told me three years ago that i would see shuttles launch , meet rocket scientists and have a friend in space i would thought you were crazy , but all those things have happened – so why not space ? hopefully my enthusiasm will encourage more people to dream			1
space is starting to open up to more people			1
companies such as @entity55 and @entity56 offering tourist flights are just the start			1
astronauts i ’ve spoken to are keen that more people should share their unique view of the planet			2
they are using social media to share their time in space , and current @entity67 commander @entity66 has sent down a plethora of awe - inspiring images from on high			1
the space sector has come a long way from its beginnings where only macho male military pilots had the chance to be astronauts , so it ’s such a shame that @entity77 campaign has seemingly ignored this progress			2
is the ad sexist ? according to @entity0 , the galactic @entity77 campaign most certainly is ready for lift off ! despite the sexism , @entity0 is still entering the contest and hopes to see @entity84 from above their adverts , encouraging people to apply for the @entity88 , portray women as poor helpless girls that have to be rescued by hunky firemen or lifeguards - not even polite enough to thank their rescuers before ditching them for a male astronaut			1
the campaign slogan ' leave a man , return a hero ' begs the question ' which man shall i leave ? '			2
' but the product is aimed at men ' i hear you cry			0
well i ’m not stupid			0
i know that it ’s a male brand			0
i know that @entity77 adverts have always used sex to sell their products			2
it ’s not that that i take issue with			0
it ’s the fact that the adverts promote outdated stereotype that space is just for men , so much so that several in several countries @entity77 refused to allow female entrants to the competition when it began			1
research has shown that enduring cultural stereotypes about women ’s abilities in scientific fields have real - world effects on their success in the lab. this international , multimillion pound campaign reinforces those stereotypes and may put off the next generation of female scientists			1
i think it ’s really damaging and i want to highlight the fact that there are many amazing women who also work in space			2
if i won a chance to go to space i would not be able to contain my excitement and nor would i want to			2
space is dangerous , and amazing , and flashy , and sexy			0
plan b : if @entity77 does n't work out , @entity0 hopes to go into space with sir @entity145 's @entity55 we need to encourage more people to study science and engineering and remember what it was about space that made us dream of being astronauts when we were younger			1
too often scientists are caricatured as boffins , geeks and nerds , but at the heart of it is a desire to explore and understand			0
to be excited by the world around us			0
i would love to be able to share the experience and excitement with others and perhaps make @entity77 think about the way they portray women in the future			0
@entity30 has worked hard to encourage more women into science and engineering			0
a good friend of mine who got a long way through @entity30 ’s astronaut selection process ( for which i sadly lack the @entity32 citizenship ) , sums up the importance of this work : ' it is precisely because @entity30 has worked so hard to distance itself from its overly masculine past that i felt i had a chance in the first place			0
' she continues ' i fear @entity77 ’s @entity187 campaign tarnishes the image of all human spaceflight endeavours , not just their own , and therefore may ultimately discourage young women from imagining they might one day become an astronaut '			1
that is exactly the sort of thing that i ’m fighting against , and if i can get somewhere in this male - oriented competition , maybe that will help others dare to dream			0
@entity198 is a freelance science writer and broadcast journalist			0
she has completed the @entity200 and blogs at @entity202			0
vote for her at @entity203 not only was @entity205 's @entity204 the first @entity207 woman in space , she was the first @entity210 full stop			1
her unusual career began in 1989 , after she responded to a radio ad for would - be astronauts - and beat 13,000 other hopefuls to take her place on board a @entity218 space shuttle			2
after 18 months of intensive training at the @entity220 in @entity218 's ' @entity221 ' , @entity204 was blasted into space on the @entity224 mission in 1991			1
just 27 years old , she was the fifth youngest person ever to blast into space			0
fellow travellers included the @entity229 cosmonauts @entity227 and @entity230 , and most of the eight day trip was spent on the @entity218 space station , @entity234			0
now a broadcaster and science lecturer , @entity204 has never returned to space , although she was one of the @entity207 's three candidates for the1992 @entity240 astronaut selection process and was on the shortlist of 25 applicants in 1998 .			1

@entity0 would follow @entity204 - the first @entity210 in space
the @entity187 campaign will send 10 lucky winners *intergalactic*
@entity0 claims that the adverts promote stereotypes
hope her blog will make people vote for her on the company 's *website*
@entity0 's @entity257 is saving up for a ride on @entity145 's @entity55
