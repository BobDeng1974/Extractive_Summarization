a new @entity1 advert which makes light of the sinking of the @entity4 has outraged relatives of those who died in the tragedy			1
the advert - which implies that the ship might not have sunk had it been ' given wings ' by the drink - has been called ' blatantly offensive ' by the @entity13			1
the @entity14 has also received 46 official complaints about the animated advert			1
the captain asks a dockhand what the drink is , and on hearing the beverage 's catchphrase - that ' it gives you wings ' he questions why a ship would ever need wings			1
the crate is then lowered from the ship - revealing that the boat in question is the @entity4 , which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 , leading to more than 1,500 deaths			1
the captain ( right ) dismissed the notion that a ship could need ' wings ' and walks off as the vessel is revealed to be the @entity4 relatives of victims and campaigners have claimed that the advert is in bad taste because it suggests an energy drink may have saved their lives the @entity13 , formed to ' preserve , protect , respect and remember ' those who died in the tragedy , has condemned the advert			1
trust founder @entity62 said he was considering complaining to advertising regulators			0
he said : ' it is very offensive and just disrespectful			0
' we appreciate there will be commercial ventures involving the @entity4 which we say is fine - as long as it is in good taste and respectful			2
' there is a difference between making a joke and this			0
' i get jokes all the time about icebergs and the like , taking the mick out of my interest in the @entity4 , but that is banter			2
' this is blatantly offensive because it is taking the mick out of the people who have passed away			0

he said : ' i have a sense of humour but i really do n’t like the idea - in fact i find it quite sickening considering so many people died on that night			1
' with their slogan ‘ @entity1 gives you wings ’ i can only assume that they are referring to the idea that if all those people had @entity1 - or wings - then they would have been ok			2
' i do n’t mind people making a joke about things , but i do n’t think lots of people dying like that is something you should be laughing at			0
i think the @entity4 , and the people involved , should be treated with dignity and respect			2
