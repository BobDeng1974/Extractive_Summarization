it may be the fastest animal to run on the @entity2 , but the cheetah could be racing to extinction			0
scientists think the animals ' speed has left them ill - equipped to deal with their modern environment			2
there are fewer than 10,000 cheetahs left in the wild - down from 100,000 a century ago			1
it may be the fastest animal to run on the @entity2 , but the cheetah could be racing to extinction			0
scientists think the animals ' speed has left them ill - equipped to deal with their modern environment and the way they are built for speed - with a slimline build and low body mass - has left it less able to store energy when it is not sprinting			1
before humans built across the @entity27 savannah where cheetahs hunt , this was not a problem			1
in times of plenty , the animals could rely on their 75mph speed to catch plenty of prey			0
but in the modern age , with their shrinking habitat squeezed on all sides by buildings and farmland , there is far greater competition for food from larger and stronger predators such as lions , leopards and hyeenas			1

lead researcher dr @entity74 , whose paper is published in the journal @entity77 , said : ' @entity78 may be ferraris but most of the time they are driving slowly			1
wildlife populations around the world have more than halved in just four decades in the face of unsustainable human consumption , a report has warned			0
mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish have declined on average by 52 per cent from 1970 to 2010 , according to @entity93 's @entity92 , which uses information on 10,380 populations of 3,038 species to see how global wildlife is faring			2
experts from the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , which maintains the database of information on the species , said the figures meant that where in 1970 there was a population of 100 animals , now there were only 50			0
for freshwater creatures , the situation is even worse , with population declines of more than three - quarters ( 76 per cent ) in 40 years , the ' living planet index ' of species shows			0
' what our study showed was that their major energy costs seem to be incurred by travelling , rather than securing prey			2
' if you can imagine walking up and down sand dunes in high temperatures day in , day out , with no water to drink you start to get a feel for how challenging these cats ' daily lives are			0
' ' the reality may be that human activities – for example erecting fences that inhibit free travel or over-hunting cheetah prey – are forcing cheetahs to travel ever - increasing distances and that this may be compromising their energy more than any other single factor			2
' the team studied 19 free - roaming cheetahs each for two weeks across two sites in southern @entity27 , injecting them with a traceable substance and then collecting their droppings			2
analysis of the waste showed how much of the substance they were losing each day , allowing the scientists to calculate their energy expenditure			0
co-author dr @entity148 , also from @entity60 said : ' research of this type helps improve our understanding of the challenges facing cheetahs as they strive to survive and helps inform future decisions on conservation strategies for cheetahs and other threatened animals			0
' dr @entity159 , of @entity160 in the @entity161 , who also worked on the resaerch , added : ' too often we blame lions and hyenas for decimating cheetah populations when in fact , it is likely to be us humans that drive their declines			0
' imagine how hard it must be for a small cub to follow its mother further and further through the desert to look for food , while she herself is fighting for survival			0

around 10,000 cheetahs in the wild , down from 100,000 a century ago
this is largely *due* to the loss of habitat across the @entity27 savannah
there is now greater competition for food from stronger predators
@entity78 's spend much of their energy slowly stalking the savannah
but their slimline build and low body mass has left them less able to store energy when it is not sprinting
