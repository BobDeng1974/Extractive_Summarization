by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:02 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 03:48 est , 22 april 2013 @entity3 mp @entity2 has warned her own leader @entity4 not to panic and to be careful to avoid ' dog whistle politics ' on immigration			2
the shadow health minister said the party could be plunged into a downward spiral if it tried too hard to apologise for its record on immigration			1
the @entity13 @entity12 had made people ' panicky ' about immigration but mr @entity4 must resist the temptation to become ' over-anxious ' to reassure voters			1
@entity3 mp @entity2 said the party could be plunged into a downward spiral if it tried too hard to apologise for its record on immigration ms @entity2 said : ' we are in the middle of a recession , or as near as damn it			1
in a recession you always see a rise in racism and anti-immigrant feeling - you had it in @entity30 in the 1930s			1
' we have to be very careful about our language because when people are frightened about their future , they want to blame outsiders , they want to blame the other , ' she told the @entity39 programme yesterday			2
' i know @entity4 thinks very carefully about what he says on the question , there is nothing he has said i disagree with			0
' all parties need to be careful of dog - whistle politics on immigration where the text is fine but the underlying message is one that is maybe not so fine			2
' i think the rise of @entity12 have made people panicky about immigration , but the truth about the fear of immigration is that it ’s just a fear – the more immigrants there are living in your area the less likely you are to worry about it			1
' i do n’t think @entity4 is scared of that kind of message			0
i think as a party we need to be clear , there ’s a danger of a kind of downward spiral , if we kind of panic about @entity12 and feel over-anxious about reassuring people on immigration			1
' her comments came as the @entity75 ambassador to the @entity13 lashed out at local election ' propaganda ' describing @entity75 people as a ' threat ' to @entity13			1

leader of the @entity3 @entity4 was told not to apologise for its record on immigration faith minister @entity92 earlier told @entity93 that @entity94 had made great strides in taking racism out of the immigration debate			2
she said : ' politicians are regularly looking for those which can unite us - we talk about values , sometimes we talk about symbols like the @entity104			0
' we have to keep focussing on those things that unite us			0
of course there has to be some quite targeted work ... but i think we have got to come back to the approach this government has adopted , which is about focusing on those things that unite us , being very strong against issues of discrimination and protecting those communities who feel they 're subjected to hate crime			0
' one of the things @entity94 did incredibly well , even in opposition , was to de-racialise the immigration debate			0
' immigration is not about the colour of anyone 's skin any more , it 's a simple issue of resources at any one time			0
