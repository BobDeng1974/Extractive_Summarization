vinegar can kill bacteria when new knee joints become infected vinegar is n’t just for livening up fish and chips — doctors are now using its key ingredient to treat infections in knee replacements			1
surgeons in @entity11 are applying acetic acid to kill bacteria when new knee joints become infected , thereby reducing the need for further surgery			1
in the @entity16 , 82,000 knee replacement operations take place every year			1
but bacteria can get inside the knee during surgery , causing infection — sometimes years later — leading to inflammation and swelling			1
untreated , this can cause the joint to loosen and eventually collapse			1
if the infection is superficial , oral antibiotics can be prescribed , but some infections do n’t respond			2
in such cases , surgeons ’ only option is to remove the replacement joint , cut away dead tissue , wash out the knee ( using saline , to sterilise , or iodine , which has antimicrobial properties ) and put in a new joint			1
sometimes , they can put in the replacement knee during the same operation , but this is usually done six to eight weeks later			1
in the meantime , the knee is packed with a special ‘ cement ’ , which releases high concentrations of antibiotics to ensure the infection is killed			2
each operation costs £ 15,000 to £ 20,000			2
now , surgeons at @entity50 of @entity51 and @entity52 hope that bathing the site with vinegar when they remove the infected joint means they can replace the joint in just one operation			1
tests have shown that soaking the biofilm ( the sticky layer of bacteria inside the knee ) in this acid solution effectively kills the bacteria better than standard saline , says @entity66 , consultant orthopaedic surgeon at both hospitals			1
‘ we have treated around 25 patients in a prospective trial to show it is safe			0
' they had no increase in heart rate , breathing or blood pressure — signs of pain — and no wound complications or delayed healing , suggesting that it was effective			0
’ tests have shown that soaking the biofilm ( the sticky layer of bacteria inside the knee ) in vinegar effectively kills the bacteria better than standard saline one patient who has benefited is @entity88 , 69 , a retired major in the @entity90			1
after years of pain , in 2002 he had a left knee replacement on the @entity93			1
but six weeks after the joint was put in , it began to ooze yellow gunge and he was diagnosed with an infection			2
three months later , he had surgery to remove the joint and ‘ cement ’ was packed into his knee			1
four months later , @entity88 had a third operation to give him a new knee joint			2
in the intervening months , he wore a splint to keep his knee straight and relied on crutches			0
keeping the leg straight for so long made his skin shrink , so he needed a skin graft			0
for the next ten years , he was active as ever — ‘ but three years ago , my knee began oozing again			0
doctors said the dormant infection was back ’			0
he was put on antibiotics , but these did n’t help			0
eventually , @entity88 was told doctors could remove the infected prosthesis and fuse bones together to keep the leg straight — but , if that failed , they would have to amputate above the knee			2
@entity88 was horrified , so he sought a second opinion from @entity66			0
‘ he told me he could take the infected joint out , bathe the knee in vinegar to kill the infection and replace the joint , ’ says @entity88			1
in december 2013 , @entity88 had the two - hour operation privately			0
‘ now , the oozing has stopped , my leg has healed and i ’m out of pain , ’ he says			0
mr @entity66 hopes that , in future , acetic acid may be used in all knee replacement operations to prevent infection in the first place			1
‘ it could also be used in other joint replacements , including hips , shoulders and elbows , to save the @entity93 large sums , ’ he says			0
@entity141 , consultant knee surgeon at @entity142 and @entity143 , says infection in knee replacement surgery is ‘ a huge problem , affecting around 1 per cent of patients ’			1
new research from the @entity149 shows adding sugar to the saline solution used to wash out joints in orthopaedic surgery can protect cartilage and lower the risk of osteoarthritis ‘ revision surgery to replace an infected implant is complex , costing several times more than the initial surgery , and involves longer hospital stays and long antibiotic courses			2
‘ any method of making it more effective is welcome , since revision surgery to eradicate infection can fail in up to 20 per cent of cases			2
‘ a simple solution with vinegar sounds interesting , but this is a small study			0
we need much larger ones to show it works and does no harm			0
’ and vinegar ’s not the only store cupboard staple finding its way into operations			2
new research from the @entity149 shows adding sugar to the saline solution used to wash out joints in orthopaedic surgery can protect cartilage and lower the risk of osteoarthritis			0
mr @entity66 is planning to use sterile medical honey , @entity183 , in revision surgery to replace an infected knee joint			1
‘ there ’s evidence sugar can fight bacteria , ’ he says			0
‘ it involves coating bones to create a hostile environment for bacteria , so they do n’t stick to the implant initially — though we do n’t yet know how long effects will last			0
‘ sugar and vinegar have been used in medicine for centuries and do n’t create resistance as antibiotics do			0

in the @entity16 , 82,000 knee replacement operations take place every year
bacteria can get inside the knee during surgery , causing infection

bathing with vinegar means surgeons can replace joint in one operation
acetic acid may be used in all knee replacement operations
