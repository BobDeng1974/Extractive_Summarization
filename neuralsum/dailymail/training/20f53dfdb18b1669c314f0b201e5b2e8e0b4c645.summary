a devoted boyfriend spent months building his girlfriend a beautiful customized armoire for her jewelry - and then popped the question after hiding an engagement ring inside it			1
@entity6 gave the handmade mahogany drawer set to girlfriend @entity8 for their second anniversary on october 9 , telling her : ' i thought you needed something a little bit better than shoe boxes [ to store your jewelry ]			1
' start at the top [ drawer ] and work your way down			0
it was in the very bottom of the elaborately - designed furniture that the real surprise lay in wait however			2
after @entity8 had unearthed a treasure trove of sweet treats , @entity6 suggested that she take another look in the @entity56 - filled bottom drawer , saying : ' i do n't think you looked in that drawer hard enough			1
' you 've got to dig around a little bit			0
' it did n't take long for @entity8 to uncover a small wooden box hidden among her favorite chocolate bars , which she opened to reveal a stunning diamond ring			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity8 's family and friends were all there to witness the surprise proposal ever the gentleman , @entity6 quickly dropped to one knee and asked the sobbing college senior : ' will you make me the happiest guy in the world and marry me ? ' unsurprisingly , it did n't take long for his speechless girlfriend to nod her consent , before enveloping her fiance in a big hug			1
' i just got really emotional because he put so much thought and work into it , ' @entity8 told @entity84			2
' he was so considerate in taking into account what i actually needed and might like			0
' hidden treasure : @entity6 hid the ring among a stash of @entity56 bars , which are one of @entity8 's favorite chocolates the heartwarming moment was captured on camera by @entity8 's mother - and posted to @entity97 the day after the proposal , where it has quickly amassed more than 630,000 views			1
' i was so thankful they were videotaping it because i really do nâ€™t remember from opening the box until five minutes later , ' @entity8 added			2
' we just put it up because we knew our family would want to see it			0
if our friends wanted to watch it , that was cool			0
' but we had never thought it would do anything like this			0
' better than shoe boxes : @entity6 wanted his fiancee to have something nicer in which to store all her jewelry ' start at the top ... ' @entity8 's future husband told her to open each drawer of the armoire to check what was hidden inside the couple are both currently in their last year of college - @entity8 , 22 , is spending the year doing clinical lab work at a @entity129 hospital , while 21 - year - old @entity6 is studying at a school about two hours away in @entity131 , @entity129 - and are due to finish up their courses in may			1
and it looks as though @entity6 will have plenty to occupy his free time after he graduates ; the skilled carpenter has already received a number of armoire requests from viewers of the @entity97 video eager to get their hands on one of his custom pieces			2
' i am very interested in buying a jewelry chest like that if you make more ! ' one commented , while another added : ' this is so beautiful and the armoire is amazing			0
could you make me one if i pay you ? ! '			0
