made headlines : this @entity10 photo of a girl at the @entity1 from @entity9 with a cake along with a racist remark has some students fuming controversy : offended students took to @entity27 to express their disdain for the post while others defended it i was so baffled that 77 people liked it and none of those 77 people told her it was inappropriate , ' @entity13 said			1
the photo reached the eyes of the vice president of public relations for the @entity1 's @entity43 @entity42 who was n’t pleased			1
' i did n’t know it was okay for white people to say n * * * * now ? who knew ? ' as soon as the @entity1 heard about the backlash surrounding the photo , the @entity1 @entity51 posted a response to their @entity53 and said , ' we are aware of an insensitive post from a community member and are addressing it with the chapter as it does not align with our @entity62 values			1
' hitting back : upon hearing about the racist @entity10 photo the @entity1 's @entity62 life organization made it clear they were not linked to the post taking responsibility : the @entity9 sorority chapter in @entity71 took to @entity72 to label the photo and comment inappropriate and not in line with their beliefs the sorority posted on their @entity72 saying , ' we have become aware of an unacceptable @entity10 post by a member of our chapter			1
the @entity82 volunteers and staff are working with our chapter at the @entity1 at this time to hold this member accountable			0

@entity9 made headlines back in april of 2013 when a tirade of an email was sent to the sorority sisters telling them to stop being so ' f * * * * ing awkward and boring			2
' ' and for those of you who are offended at this email , i would apologize but i really do n't give a f * * *			2
go f * * * yourself , ' concluded the email			2
it seems as though offensive public outcries are a bit of an unofficial tradition for the @entity1 's @entity62 organization .			0
