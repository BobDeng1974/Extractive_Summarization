by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 14 march 2013 is @entity3 boss @entity2 right to recall @entity4 ? @entity2 admitted @entity4 has every right to feel a ' grievance ' towards him as he ended the @entity8 defender 's international exile			1
@entity4 , who has not played for @entity3 since a @entity10 qualifier against @entity11 in june 2011 , returns for the @entity13 qualifiers against @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity3 head coach @entity2 has dropped @entity16 from the 26 - man travelling party , which includes the recalled @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity4 returns : @entity8 defender @entity4 is back in the @entity3 squad			2
his last game for the @entity3 was in june 2011 @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , @entity19 ( @entity26 ) , @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
@entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity32 ( @entity31 ) , @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , @entity20 ( @entity29 ) , @entity4 ( @entity8 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity8 ) , @entity38 ( @entity29 )			1

@entity55 ( @entity29 ) , @entity53 ( @entity8 ) , @entity54 ( @entity36 ) , @entity52 ( @entity8 )			2
@entity2 , who has yet to speak with the @entity8 defender about his selection , said yesterday : ' if @entity4 has a grievance and does hold it against me because i have n't previously selected him there 's not much i can do about that			1
it 's a concern , but i ca n't do more than i am by giving him a chance to come back and making it clear i would like to use him			2
i ca n't do more			2
' i like to do my talking to players face to face			2
the telephone sometimes is not the greatest of instruments , especially if you do n't know people extremely well			2
' @entity2 has always quoted footballing reasons for @entity4 's omission and inadvertently appeared to end his @entity3 career in an unguarded conversation with a fellow passenger on a @entity79 last october			1
the defender is understood to have been shocked by yesterday 's announcement , but honoured to be playing for his country again			2
@entity4 has had an uneasy relationship with @entity84 after the @entity31 defender gave evidence on behalf of retired @entity3 skipper @entity87 in his court case with @entity89 last july			0
@entity4 was fined £ 45,000 by the @entity90 over his infamous ' choc ice ' tweet after the trial , a slang reference to @entity30 's ethnicity			0
@entity30 was later fined £ 90,000 for calling the @entity90 a ' bunch of t * * * * ' when @entity87 was banned for four matches and fined £ 220,000 after he was found guilty of racially abusing @entity89			0
recalling @entity4 : @entity2 has brought back @entity4 @entity3 manager @entity2 and under 21 counterpart @entity98 will go head - to - head at the @entity101 in may as the @entity90 help celebrate 125 years of football in the @entity104			1
a line - up of @entity90 legends , managed by @entity2 , will take on the current @entity104 team who will be bossed by @entity98			1
the likes of @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 will line up for the @entity117			0
the @entity90 have donated £ 10,000 to help get the event off the ground with ticket sale proceeds going to service charities that promote sporting opportunities for soldiers , including wounded servicemen who play sport as part of their rehabilitation			0
the fixture also forms part of the @entity90 's 150th anniversary celebrations and chairman @entity131 said : ' we at the @entity90 greatly value our close relationship with the @entity134 and believe that we should celebrate their work whenever possible			0
' in fact , the @entity104 has a proud heritage with the @entity90 going all the way back to our formative years in the 1860s			0
this match will be more than fitting , especially with the @entity104 @entity90 marking their 125th anniversary			0
' however , @entity30 and @entity4 shook hands before sunday 's @entity144 clash between @entity8 and @entity31 and it is understood they are prepared to put their differences behind them in the interests of the national team			0
@entity2 added : ' they were very good friends , but we are talking about @entity3 as a football team and not purely individuals			1
' i expect the pair of them to do their job with @entity3			0
@entity84 has to do his job at left back and @entity4 has to do his at centre half			0
' i do n't expect any problems			0
if there are any i will have to deal with them , but i 'm rather hoping the long - term friendship can re-emerge and the unfortunate incident along the way can be forgotten			1
the spirit in the group is good and they do seem to care about each other			0
' i would be unhappy if there were tensions between players in a group , but this is an @entity3 team and these players are fierce rivals sometimes on the field of play			0
' we are talking about two very experienced professional players here and we are talking about the @entity3 football team			0
i do n't envisage any problems			0
' @entity3 's head coach watched @entity4 , who has 81 caps , play against @entity189 in the @entity190 at @entity191 last week and again in the @entity144 quarter - final with @entity31			1
@entity2 added : ' if he is still playing in 2014 like he is now then there is no reason why he can not be part of the squad in 2014 for the @entity13			1
' football reasons : @entity198 said it was a no - brainer to recall @entity4 @entity3 play @entity14 a week today and then travel on to @entity15 for a @entity13 qualifier that could shape @entity2 's destiny			1
@entity3 go into the game behind @entity15 in second place in @entity204 , knowing they need a win to put automatic qualification for @entity208 2014 back in their own hands			2
the big test for the squad will come in @entity213 , when @entity53 will return to the stadium where he was sent off in a @entity10 qualifier against @entity15			2
together again : @entity4 and @entity30 have not played with each other since june 2011 at arm 's length : @entity2 insists @entity30 and @entity4 are good friends but it will be interesting to see how they get on glove story : @entity26 goalkeeper @entity19 has ended his international sabbatical and returns to the squad hands on : @entity25 's @entity226 is expected to be first choice with @entity28 's @entity27 challenging him how it stands : @entity204 @entity2 added : ' you do n't forget a sending off but his disciplinary record , ignoring the occasion when he paid dearly against @entity15 , has been very good			1
i will be speaking to all the players			0
' away matches at this level require a lot of discipline , but i wo n't single out @entity53			0
he has not let me down as a player , so i have no reason to doubt him			0
' @entity20 , who has won only four caps , is back in the squad for the first time since his appearance against @entity244 in march 2011			1
hot spurs : @entity29 's @entity20 and @entity21 ( r ) are back in the @entity3 fold national service : @entity31 defender @entity32 keeps his place in @entity2 's squad leading the way : @entity36 midfielder @entity42 will captain @entity3 centre of attention : @entity31 's @entity43 and @entity8 's @entity254 are options in midfield hands up if you 're in the @entity3 squad : @entity53 will look to lead the line for the @entity3 in @entity14 and @entity15 forward thinking : @entity8 star @entity52 and @entity49 ace @entity50 ( r ) are also included			1
