by @entity0 an international panel of experts are to re-examine all of the data gathered in the hunt for the missing @entity5 to ensure search crews have been looking in the right place			1
government officials from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 today pledged not to give up searching for the aircraft that disappeared almost two months ago			1
they met in the @entity14 capital to discuss the next step in the search for the missing flight , which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the @entity21 off @entity9			1
experts are to re-examine information gathered so far officials met in the @entity14 capital to discuss the next step in the search for the missing flight , which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the @entity21 off @entity9 the area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane 's likeliest flight path based on satellite and radar data			1
starting wednesday , that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all information gathered so far in the search , which has not turned up a single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million square kilometers ( 1.8 million square miles ) of ocean			1
' we 've got to this stage of the process where it 's very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered , all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there 's no flaws in it , the assumptions are right , the analysis is right and the deductions and conclusions are right , ' @entity51 , head of the search operation , told reporters in @entity69			1
investigators have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on march 8 during a flight from @entity75 to @entity76			1
a weekslong search for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk			2
' unfortunately , all of that effort has found nothing , ' @entity14 transport minister @entity23 said			0
' we 've been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one , but in practice , that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft			2
' @entity51 has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year			1
@entity51 and @entity23 met with @entity11 defense minister @entity26 and @entity10 transport minister @entity27 in @entity69 on monday to map out the next steps of the underwater search , which will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre patch of seafloor @entity51 , head of the search operation , has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year a map shows the possible path of @entity5 as released by the @entity103 last week @entity51 and @entity23 met with @entity11 defense minister @entity26 and @entity10 transport minister @entity27 in @entity69 on monday to map out the next steps of the underwater search , which will focus on a 60,000 square kilometer ( 23,000 square mile ) patch of seafloor			1
financial responsibility is a major focus of the talks and @entity23 has seemed to open the door to @entity111 , which produced the 777 - 200er jet , and engine maker @entity113 , to contribute financially			0
' they also have a vested interested in what happened on @entity5 so they can be confident about the quality of their product , or take remedial action if there was some part of the aircraft that contributed to this accident , ' he told reporters			1
' so , i think we will be looking for increasing involvement from the manufacturers , and their host countries			0
' officials are contacting governments and private contractors to find out whether they have specialized equipment that can dive deeper than the @entity134 - 21 @entity14 navy vessel @entity135 is pictured berthed at @entity137 near @entity138 as it replenishes its supplies and conducts routine maintenance and software modifications to @entity134 - 21 before returning to the search area commander @entity148 658 , commodore @entity150 ( right ) , @entity143 , captain @entity144 ( left ) and @entity145 , commander @entity146 ( centre ) hold a media conference in front of the @entity14 navy vessel @entity135 last week , @entity11 released its most comprehensive account yet of what happened to @entity5 , detailing the route the plane probably took as it veered off course and the confusion that followed			1
@entity159 president @entity158 had publicly promised to commit more assets , but government sources say the @entity159 is keen to begin passing on the costs of providing the expensive sonar equipment the officials say they are trying to source			2
officials are contacting governments and private contractors to find out whether they have specialized equipment that can dive deeper than the @entity134 - 21 , an unmanned sub that has spent weeks scouring the seafloor in an area where sounds consistent with a plane 's black box were detected in early april			1
the @entity134 has been limited by the fact that it can dive only to depths of 4.5 kilometers ( 2.8 miles ) - and parts of the search zone are likely deeper than that			2
adding to the difficulties is the fact no one really knows exactly how deep the water in the search area is			2
' i do n't know that anyone knows for sure , because it 's never been mapped , ' @entity23 said , adding that detailed mapping of the seafloor will be a key focus of the next phase of the search			2
in addition to deeper diving capabilities , the new equipment will be able to send information back to crews in real time			2
the @entity134 's data can be downloaded only once it returns to the surface after each of its 16 - hour dives			0
it will likely take another two months before any new equipment is in the water , @entity23 said			0
the @entity134 will continue to be used in the meantime , though its search is currently on hold while the @entity135 , which has the sub on board , is taking on supplies at a base in @entity9			1
the 21 - foot - long autonomous underwater vehicle is designed for deep - sea surveying and is capable of staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling , scanning regions at a speed of two to three knots			0
shaped like a torpedo , it can operate almost up to three miles underneath the waves and is equipped with a variety of sonar and cameras that can search and map 40 square miles of sea floor per day			0
@entity223 has a depth rating of 4,500m , meaning it has been at its limit in the @entity21 search zone			1
bluefin 21 is designed for deep - sea surveying and is capable of staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling searchers usually programme the propeller - driven vehicle with the coordinates for a back - and - forth search that has been compared to mowing a lawn			0
first , the vehicle will survey the area with side - scan sonar			0
the sonar readings are stored in the robot 's removable memory , and retrieved once the sub comes back up to the surface			0
if the sonar scan turns up objects of interest , the @entity223 would be refitted with high - resolution cameras for a visual survey			0
the robot would have to dive closer to the seafloor for a concentrated survey of the target area			0
one of the @entity223 's most recent claims to fame was its role in the search for wreckage from @entity258 's airplane , which disappeared in the @entity259 in 1937			0
@entity260 says its @entity261 can also be used for archaeology , oceanography , mine countermeasures , and unexploded ordinance .			0

government officials met in @entity9 to discuss next step in @entity5 search
search will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in @entity21
data collected since plane went missing early march to be re-examined to ensure search crews have been looking for the aircraft in the right place
head of search operation has warned it is likely to continue for up to a year
