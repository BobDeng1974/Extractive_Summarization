tiny robots that can swim in the bloodstream and attack diseases may sound as if they belong in a sci - fi film			0
but these so - called nanorobots are set to be used to treat a person who is seriously ill with leukaemia			1
the lead researcher behind the innovation hopes the patient could be cured within a month - and has already successfully tested the machines in animals			1
the lead researcher behind the innovation hopes that the patient could be cured within a month , based upon successful tests in animals @entity25 , who was previously at @entity27 ’s @entity26 in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity31 ’s @entity30 , intends to treat a patient who has been given six months to live			1
the patient is set to receive an injection of @entity16 nanorobots designed to interact with and destroy leukaemia cells without damaging healthy tissue			1
speaking in december , he said : ‘ judging from what we saw [ in tests ] , within a month that person is going to recover			0
@entity15 can be programmed to independently recognise target cells and deliver payloads , such as cancer drugs , to these cells			1
the double helixes stay closed until specific molecules or proteins on the surface of cancer cells act like a ' key ' to open the ‘ barrel ’ so the payload can be deployed			1
this diagram shows the nanorobot being ' unlocked ' so the drugs ( shown in purple ) are released nanorobots are ' devices ' made from dna that are so small they can be injected into the bloodstream and carry a payload of drugs to specific cells			1
they are built upon a single strand of @entity16 which is combined with short synthetic strands of dna designed by the experts			1
when mixed together , they self - assemble into a desired shape , which in this case looks a bit like an open - ended barrel			0
the robots have two halves linked together by flexible dna hinges , which are held shut by latches that are @entity16 double helixes a complementary piece of @entity16 is attached to a payload of drugs , which enables it to bind to the inside of the biological barrel			1

@entity15 can recognise a small population of target cells within a large population			0
@entity94 , who is involved in the research at the @entity26 explained the idea of the microscopic robots is to make a ‘ cage ’ that protects a fragile or toxic payload and ‘ only releases it at the right moment			1

dr @entity25 said : ' the nanorobot we designed actually looks like an open - ended barrel , or clamshell that has two halves linked together by flexible dna hinges and the entire structure is held shut by latches that are dna double helixes			0

' the nanorobot is capable of recognising a small population of target cells within a large healthy population , ’ dr @entity25 continued			0
‘ while all cells share the same drug target that we want to attack , only those target cells that express the proper set of keys open the nanorobot and therefore only they will be attacked by the nanorobot and by the drug			0
’ the team has tested its technique in animals as well as cell cultures and said the ‘ nanorobot attacked these [ targets ] with almost zero collateral damage			0
’ the method has many advantages over invasive surgery and blasts of drugs , which can be ‘ as painful and damaging to the body as the disease itself , ’ the team added			2
in the future , dr @entity25 said people could be injected with nanorobots at an annual doctor ’s check - up ( illustrated with a stock image )			2
the nanorobots would screen ‘ every cell ’ in the body for cancerous or abnormal cells and destroy them before they spread if dr @entity25 's approach proves successful in humans , and is backed by more research in the coming years , the team ’s work could signal a transformational moment in cancer treatment and could be used for many other diseases by delivering drugs more effectively without causing side effects			1
the field of dna nanotechnology has been around for around 30 years			0
@entity182 @entity181 first came up with the idea of bending strands of @entity16 into shapes and since then 2d and 3d structures have been constructed			0
dr @entity25 and his team have only been working on their innovation for three years but said the robots could be used to fix injured spinal cords in a couple of years ’ time			2
stronger drugs deemed too toxic using current techniques , could also be used to blitz cancer cells			2
' this could revolutionise everything we know about drugs and medicine , ’ he said			2
in the future , dr @entity25 said people could even be injected with nanorobots at an annual doctor ’s check - up			2
the nanorobots would screen ‘ every cell ’ in the body for cancerous or abnormal cells and destroy them before they spread			1
currently , the technology can detect 12 types of tumour			0

team at @entity27 ’s @entity26 in @entity29 created nanorobots
they could be used to treat a leukaemia patient with just six months to live
nanorobots are made from dna strands and carry a payload of drugs
inventor hopes innovation could revolutionise how drugs are delivered and be used to *diagnose* abnormal cells before they become cancerous
