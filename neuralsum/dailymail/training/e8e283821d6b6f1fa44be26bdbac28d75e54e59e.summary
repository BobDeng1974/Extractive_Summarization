by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 chairman @entity2 has shrugged off the limitations of a £ 49million transfer cap by revealing that the new @entity7 champions are well on the way to landing their summer transfer targets			1
city want to sign defender @entity11 on a free transfer from @entity13 and retain a strong interest in £ 35m - rated @entity16 defender @entity15 and his teammate @entity17 despite an @entity19 punishment for breaching @entity21 regulations			1
as well as having their net spending capped , @entity10 's wage bill has also been frozen although £ 200,000 - a - week will be freed up after @entity2 confirmed that @entity25 and @entity26 are not being offered new contracts			1
quick mover : @entity3 chairman @entity2 tells fans they 'll move quickly with transfers @entity32 starts now : @entity33 ( left ) says the club knows who they want and who they do n't on the move ? @entity10 is targeting @entity13 's @entity39 - winning defender @entity11 for a move across @entity41 in demand : @entity16 's @entity15 is rated at £ 35m but still a primary focus for the @entity7 champions under pressure : city financial constraints have n't dampened their interest in @entity17 , also from @entity16 after stealing a march on their rivals by spending nearly £ 100m on @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 last summer , the @entity10 chief promised that they will not waste any time again now			1
he said : ' expect the same - but even earlier			0
' today i can tell you we know exactly what needs to be done , we know exactly the players that need to go and the players that need to come to the areas that need to be strengthened			0
' so i can tell our fans : expect an efficient and swift execution plan and we will have , after the @entity68 , a good pre-season and will go into the season very ready as we did last year ready to compete in four all four competitions			1
' @entity10 's actions last summer , including the sacking of @entity73 as manager , put the club back on an upward trajectory after a relatively disappointing end to the 2012 - 13 season			1

moving on : @entity33 ( right ) , with @entity79 ( left ) and @entity82 , says @entity21 restrictions of £ 49m will have ' no material impact ' on their plans paint it blue : @entity88 's @entity87 is covered in confetti as fans celebrate the @entity7 glory he said : ' @entity79 feels this club is doing exactly what he intended it to do in terms of performance across the board - on the field , off field , trophies , championships and wins , but also commercial success , and the fans ' support has been unwavering			1
' genuinely , @entity79 is absolutely delighted with the way this club , this company , this business is performing			1
' @entity10 did attract criticism after parting company with @entity73 , as the @entity112 had led the club to their first title in 44 years in 2012			1
but @entity115 has proved a popular , reliable and successful replacement and the club feel their decision has been vindicated			2
@entity33 said : ' the decision to hire @entity115 was a very important decision for us as we look at the next couple of years			2
' i am absolutely delighted for him , for the fans , for the club , for everyone involved at @entity3			1
' it is a perfectly justified decision			0
i think the results speak for themselves			0
' leadership : manager @entity115 and @entity82 pose after a job well done justified : the results of the season validate @entity10 's choice to replace @entity73 with @entity115 one of the next targets for @entity10 will be to carry their domestic pre-eminence onto the @entity137 stage			1
some progress on this front has been made under @entity115 , with the club reaching the @entity142 knockout stage for the first time			2
@entity33 said : ' this year we have made some progress			0
we have played much better football , been a lot more competitive and i think the experience coming through the two games against @entity151 will be invaluable for us			0
' @entity152 has always been an integral part of our strategy , an integral part of the success we want to achieve for this club			2
we will continue to progress			0
' @entity33 also paid tribute to two @entity10 players who are now out of contract in @entity26 and @entity25 and are set to leave this summer			1
defender @entity26 , signed from @entity160 in an acrimonious £ 22million deal in 2009 , played a key role in the 2012 title win			2
moved on : former @entity160 defender @entity26 ( right ) has n't been retained by @entity10 tribute : as with @entity26 , @entity33 thanked @entity25 for his services to @entity10 after a year 's loan at @entity160 @entity33 said : ' he is a wonderful man			1
he has served this club loyally and he has had some of his best performances in his career here at @entity3			0

it was a tough time for him but i am really happy for him			0
he came here and had a wonderful career			0
' we will miss him and i really want to thank him for all his efforts			0
' @entity25 , who also joined the club in 2009 , enjoyed four good seasons in the @entity10 midfield before joining @entity160 on loan last summer			1
@entity33 said : ' @entity25 is another one of those wonderful players that made a big career decision when he decided to join @entity10			2
