but the final one gives some hint that this is not a usual funeral : for the ' @entity10 ' is believed to be a knowing wink to notorious @entity14 gangster @entity13 's favoured method of torture - electrocuting the bodies of those who had crossed him			1
many gangsters from the past reared their heads to pay their respects to the man who was once one of the most feared criminals in the capital , whose empire embraced fraud , gambling , protection rackets - and torture			1

@entity13 died last month - the 78 - year - old heavy smoker finally succumbing to blood poisoning following gall bladder complaints			1
his funeral procession , bedecked in flowers as it slowly drove down the @entity101 , remembered him as a ' dad ' , and an ' uncle '			2
but the legends that surround him paint a very different picture			2
he was arrested on the day @entity106 won the @entity107 in 1966			2
his trial heard he was alleged to have used iron bars , pliers and electrodes on anyone who crossed him			2
