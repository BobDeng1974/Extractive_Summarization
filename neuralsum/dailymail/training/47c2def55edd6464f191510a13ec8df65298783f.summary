@entity9 had been arrested twice by @entity43 police over previous attacks on ms @entity10 and fled to @entity26 while on police bail to avoid prosecution			1

abducted : cctv images show the moment @entity9 grabbed @entity10 on the street getaway : after strangling his victim , @entity59 drover her body to @entity7 and buried it in a shallow grave @entity9 claimed he was not in the country when ms @entity10 went missing and that both he and his victim had been wrongly identified in @entity67 footage of the abduction			1
but an @entity70 jury unanimously convicted him of murder after four hours ’ deliberation at the conclusion of a six - week trial			2
he pounced on his victim as she was heading to work from her home in @entity77 , @entity5 , in the early hours of august 12 last year			2
ms @entity10 would normally have got a lift with a friend to her job at a potato factory , but the car had broken down and she had to walk into the centre of @entity5 to get a lift with someone else ‘ @entity67 footage taken a short distance along her route shows her being overpowered and taken away by someone , ’ said prosecutor @entity86			0
‘ then she simply vanished			0
vanished : ms @entity10 had been on her way to work in a potato factory when @entity9 pounced preparation : @entity9 removed the seats and tinted the windows of his green @entity96 for the journey to @entity7			1
this @entity67 image shows him driving off the ferry from @entity102 ‘ that is until october 30 , when a man gathering mushrooms in a wood in western @entity7 came across a shallow grave containing her remains			1
‘ it was established she had died a suddenly and violently as a result of manual choking			0
‘ the prosecution say that this defendant , her former husband , is responsible for both her kidnap and murder			2
‘ and , in doing so , did exactly what he always promised her he would			0
’ ms @entity10 and @entity9 had been together since she was just 17 and had a son together before marrying in 2007			2
they divorced in september 2010 , but @entity9 persuaded her to allow him to come to the @entity43 , using their son as a bargaining chip			1
abuse : venclovas had been questioned by police over previous assaults on his former wife he was already bent on revenge after she announced she wanted to leave him and had torched a woodland home in @entity26 she had inherited from a relative two months earlier			1
their relationship was punctuated by abuse from @entity9 who became obsessed by the idea his wife was having an affair			2
describing a previous row , ms @entity143 said : ‘ he was telling her it was the destiny of her son to grow up without a mother , while hers was to be killed by him			2
’ he eventually fled the @entity43 in february last year after he was questioned by police about an attack on his ex-wife			1
an investigation into an earlier assault the previous year was dropped on the advice of the @entity155 because of difficulties understanding ms @entity10 , who spoke little @entity157			0
‘ subsequent events have of course called that decision into question , ’ said ms @entity143			0
after fleeing to @entity26 , @entity9 kept in touch with his ex-wife and their son over @entity167 and started plotting the killing when he found out she was seeing @entity170 , a workmate from the potato factory			1
he made his first trip back to the @entity43 in july last year when , despite still being wanted by @entity174 for the second attack on ms @entity10 , he managed to enter and leave the country without being arrested			1
he used the visit to stalk his ex-wife and find out about her movements and to scout burial sites in the remote @entity180 around @entity5			0
returning to his homeland , he enlisted a new lover to help tint the windows of his green @entity185 minibus so nobody could see inside			2
two days before the killing , he dropped hints about his plan to ms @entity10 ’s mother , @entity190 , during a meeting at her home			0
‘ he was saying she would be kidnapped and sold , ’ she said			2
‘ those kinds of things			0
‘ he said she was a loose woman and that she goes with anyone in @entity5			0
’ during a further visit after the killing , he told ms @entity190 : ‘ i ’ve come to tell you that @entity10 ’s not around any more			0
’ but instead of owning up , he accused her of cooking up a plot with her daughter to fake the disappearance so he would be denied access to their son			0
@entity9 , who was born @entity206 , from @entity207 , @entity26 , denied murder and kidnapping , but an @entity70 jury unanimously convicted him of murder after four hours ’ deliberation at the conclusion of a six - week trial			1
@entity9 showed no emotion at the verdict , yet giggled and smirked in the dock as judge mr @entity218 jailed him for life with a minimum term of 20 years			1
‘ this was no sudden rush of blood to the head but instead it was coldly planned and ruthlessly executed , ’ the judge told him			0
‘ there is no mitigation and you have shown not an ounce of remorse			0
‘ instead , you have been caught out by modern technology which with near pinpoint accuracy tracked your movements from beginning to end			0
‘ indeed , it is to be observed in this case that if digital records from @entity67 and other cameras across @entity157 , along with those for mobile telephone and satellite navigation devices across @entity244 , had not been available for police investgation , you would almost certainly have got away with murder			2
’ the judge said @entity59 ’ previous attacks on ms @entity10 suggested he had subjected her to prolonged torture in her final moments by holding her ‘ at the edge of unconsciousness ’			0
‘ i am sure that on this occasion you would have wanted her to know exactly what was going to happen to her , ’ he added			0
‘ and you would have guaranteed that her last moments were spent in the misery of the full realisation that her position was hopeless and that she was going to die			0
’ @entity9 , who appeared newly shaven - headed in court today , has previous convictions in @entity26 for using counterfeit documents , driving offences , theft and stealing state property - but no offences of violence .			1
