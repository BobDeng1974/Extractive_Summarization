' judge @entity195 described @entity4 as a ' ticking timebomb ' and said : ' something had to be done and it was			1
' jailing him , judge @entity198 added : ' this is an exceptionally serious case of its kind			2
it calls for an exceptional sentence to reflect the malignancy of your violent behaviour where you brutally stabbed a pregnant woman five times in order to kill her unborn child			1
' i repeat - you intended to kill that child and it is only good fortune that prevented the execution of that truly wicked objective			2
' it is good fortune alone that has resulted in the child suffering no long term effects of that trauma			2
the same can not be said for the mother			0
she is scared both physically and mentally by what you did			0
' you have been found guilty by a jury upon clear evidence			0
that jury has seen through the entirely bogus account you presented in your trial			0
' you intended really serious injury upon @entity5 and you concurrently intended , by seriously wounding her , that the life of the baby , which was at seven months gestation in her womb , would be extinguished			1
' you have not shown a shred of remorse for what you did			0
indeed , you have made outrageous assertions that @entity5 stabbed herself and attempted to kill her own baby as an act of revenge for you choosing your former partner over her			1
' let there be no mistake that this is a very serious example of a crime of this kind			0
this is not simply a case of a brutal and sustained attack upon a vulnerable woman who happened to be pregnant , but a vicious attack with a knife upon a pregnant woman intending to kill the unborn baby			1
' you wanted to kill that unborn infant and you set about that task with calculated determination			0
it was a vile act			0
' following the sentencing , detective inspector @entity257 from @entity258 , said : ' nineteen years is a long time for @entity4 to think about what he 's done in prison and it reflects the grotesque nature of the attack and the fact that @entity5 really was vital to his ultimate aim which was to kill the unborn baby			1
' you do n't come across pregnant ladies that are stabbed in broad daylight , on their doorsteps			2
it was pre-meditated , it was calculated , it was planned and it was a despicable act			0
it was only a pure miracle that they survived			0
' they will still carry mental and physical scars for the rest of their lives but it could have been far worse			0
