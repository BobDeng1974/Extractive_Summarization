by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 10 december 2013 as a recent survey reveals that women are more concerned with the state of their skin than any other body hang - up , it is no surprise the skincare business has rolled out a multitude of products that promise to turn back the effects of time			2
but one area that often gets neglected is the delicate area above the eye because no product has ever been designed to target that specific area - until now			0
@entity17 has unveiled @entity18 - an eye treatment that claims to help reduce the severe signs of skin aging in just one use , especially the look of deep lines and crepiness that affect the delicate upper eyelid area			1
banish the lines : @entity17 has unveiled @entity28 which claims to get rid of wrinkles - including those on the eyelid developed in partnership with @entity34 , the leading centre for eye research and aesthetics , the new cream even claims to work in just fifteen minutes			1
the new formulation combines @entity17 ’s exclusive idebenone technology , the single most powerful antioxidant , with a blend of arazine and thiotaine			1
botox in a bottle ? the new formulation contains @entity17 's exclusive @entity47 technology but at £ 95 , it does n't come cheap @entity48 claims to soothe skin and help reduce signs of ageing caused by inflammation , while thiotaine promises to protect skin from free radical damage due to environmental assaults			1
it also utilises moisture trap technology - a complex of hyaluronic acid , barley and sea plant extracts that work to help lock in moisture and plump and smooth skin			0
it contains optical diffusers and silicones , which claim to provide a soft focus effect to scatter light and diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for immediate bright and luminous skin			0
but does it work ? apparently so ; 75 per cent of women noted a clinical improvement in deep and fine lines in 15 minutes after use			1
the results also revealed that seven out of 10 women preferred the new @entity83 serum to their regular eye serum			2
but youth does n't come cheap : the 15ml serum , which is available in boots and should be applied twice daily , will set you back £ 95			1
speaking about the product , dr @entity89 , founder of 111 @entity90 said : ' while the results published certainly do sound impressive , it ’s important to review the ingredients that are giving these " instant " results			0
' just a glance at the formula shows that it is rich in hyaluronic acid which superficially plumps the skin surface but the effect is not long lasting			0
delicate : this is the first cream that has been designed to be used on the eyelid itself and help reduce the sagging effect ' the 15 - minute promise is largely down to the optical diffusers which are cosmetic agents , these are also found in foundation and concealers and reflect light off the skin , making wrinkles appear less prominent			2
' beauty blogger @entity114 of @entity115 added : ‘ this intensive eye serum applies beautifully - the lightweight formula means it blends effortlessly into your skin and does n’t feel heavy or greasy around the eyes			0
' it is good at tackling fine lines above the eyes , but does n’t do a huge amount to combat dark circles so is n’t the best option for anyone hoping to fight those at the same time			0
‘ and while it ’s a beautiful product - and of the highest quality - the price is really quite high and makes it out of the reach of a lot of women who wo n’t be able to afford nearly £ 100 for an eye serum			2
' for those that can afford it and want something high - end to help tackle their lines , this is the perfect product , however for anyone hoping for a bit more of an all - rounder , there are plenty of other options available at much more reasonable prices which may be more suited to their needs			0
boots , £ 15 ( @entity153 ) @entity154 , £ 27 , @entity155 ( r ) money no object : @entity158 , £ 95 ( l ) @entity159 , £ 25 , @entity155 ( r )			1
