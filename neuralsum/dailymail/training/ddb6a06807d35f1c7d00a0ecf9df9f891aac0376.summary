' i think it was right that the @entity32 looked at this case again and i note with particular interest @entity95 ’s comments on the consideration of this wider issue			0
' this is an area which i will discuss in one of my regular meetings with the judiciary on sentencing matters			0
' supporting judge @entity58 , lord @entity22 said : ' we have concluded that the sentence imposed below is not one which can be described as unduly lenient			1
' indeed , it seems to us that the sentence imposed was one within the reasonable range available to the trial judge , properly weighing the relevant factors and the guidance of this court			2
' his controversial words come weeks after convicted @entity19 's mother dismissed his crime as ‘ no big deal ’			1
in a display of callous indifference , @entity145 said she did not know ‘ what all the fuss was about ’			0

i just do n’t understand what all the fuss is about			0
’ during the hearing , mr @entity27 outlined a number of ' aggravating factors ' in the case			0
he said the victim was vulnerable because he suffered from @entity10 's syndrome , telling the court : ' it is accepted that the offender had no means of knowing the detail of the victim 's condition , but it was clear from the victim 's unusual behaviour , as seen on the @entity42 , that he was vulnerable			0
' the punch was delivered with deliberation in a place where a ' great many ' members of the public were present			0
mitigating factors included a guilty plea at an early stage , the expression of remorse , @entity19 's relatively young age , and the fact that the offence was not planned or premeditated			2
concluding , lord @entity22 said : ' we readily understand that this is the sort of case that arouses public concern			1
' if there are public concerns going beyond this case then it may well be appropriate for the wider issue to be the subject of detailed consideration and consultation by the @entity208 in the future			0
' unduly lenient ' : attorney general @entity27 had called for a review into the sentence he deemed ' lenient ' ' it is open to the secretary of state for justice or other interested bodies to invite the @entity208 to do so			1
