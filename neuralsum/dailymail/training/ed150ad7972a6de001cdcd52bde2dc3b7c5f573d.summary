do n't pass the ball to @entity1			2
nineteen years into his illustrious career , @entity2 star @entity1 finally entered the record books last night in the worst way possible when he broke the @entity7 record for most missed shots by a player			1
this as the @entity2 fell to the @entity10 107 - 102			0
to be fair , a look at the players who top the record board for this infamous honor includes the greats of the game , with @entity33 sixth on the list , @entity26 fifth and @entity27 fourth			0
among the active players who could perhaps surpass @entity1 are @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , who are all right outside the top ten			1
@entity1 needed 13 misses heading in to last night 's game to claim the record , and lucky number 13 came in the fourth quarter , pushing his lifetime total to 13,418 botched ball throws			1
only the second worst : @entity1 broke the record set by @entity22 forward @entity21 ( above ) @entity48 : among active players , @entity37 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) have the best shot at being the worst shots and taking the record away from @entity1 on a much more positive note , @entity1 still remains the youngest player in league history to notch 30,000 career points , is the all time leading scoring in @entity2 history , one of the game 's most storied franchise , and has won the all - star mvp a record four times			1
he also has two gold medals and has won the @entity7 championships five times with the @entity2			2
off the court , @entity1 is notoriously private and press shy , especially following accusations in 2003 that he raped a hotel employee at a @entity73 spa			0
so in love : @entity1 and his wife @entity75 , mother of his two children , @entity77 and @entity78 the case was eventually dropped and a civil suit settled out of court			0
@entity1 has been married to his wife @entity75 for 13 years , who scored a very nice and very expensive diamond apology ring following the aforementioned accusations said to be worth $ 4million , and the couple have two daughters , @entity77 and @entity78 .			0

@entity1 set a record for the most missed shots in the history of the @entity7 last night when he banked the ball for the 13,418th time
the @entity2 star surpassed the number set by @entity22 forward @entity21
among active players , @entity37 and @entity36 have the best chance at *beating* @entity1 's record
