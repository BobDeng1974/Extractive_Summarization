a man diagnosed with schizophrenia has described how staff at a @entity4 mental health hospital put him on a bus to @entity6 with little medication and food and told him to call 911 when he got there			1
@entity10 , 48 , received treatment at @entity12 in @entity13 last year after suffering from depression and contemplating suicide but was discharged after just three days			1
his startling case has revealed the state 's alleged practice of ' patient dumping ' , with records showing @entity4 has bought 1,500 bus tickets since 2008 - sending some mentally ill patients to places they have never been before and where they know no one			1
for @entity10 , who had wanted to stay in @entity4 , the experience was petrifying			1
' what 's waiting for me there ? i 'm already scared enough			0
' just days after checking into the hospital in february 2012 , doctors felt @entity10 was ready to leave and they asked him where he wanted to move , he said			1
' i said , " i do n't want to leave @entity4 " , ' @entity10 recounted			1
' he said , " @entity6 sounds like a really nice state			0
i think you 'll be happy there "			0
' but doctors insisted he would get better mental health care in @entity46 , even though he had never been and was not given any information about the city			1
confused : @entity10 ( pictured finally receiving treatment in @entity50 ) went to a police station and ended up at a homeless shelter where his medication soon began to wear off reunited : a @entity46 reporter and a counselor put him in touch with his daughter , left , who cares for him instead , staff drove him to a @entity61 bus station , bought him a $ 306 one - way ticket , gave him six ensure nutrition drinks , three - days worth of medication and told him to call 911 when he arrived			1
@entity10 's papers even noted his discharge address as ' @entity67 to @entity6 '			2
after the 16 - hour trip , he arrived in @entity46 and , confused , went to a police station			2
officers took him to a homeless shelter where he began feeling withdrawal symptoms from his medication			1
at the shelter , he told staff that he knew no one in the state , had nowhere to go and had run out of medication to treat his schizophrenia , anxiety and depression			2
shelter staff eventually put him on another bus to a mental health clinic , but he failed to turn up and only received help when a @entity87 reporter learned of his plight			1
facility : @entity10 was discharged from @entity12 after just three days ' no support ' : he said he told doctors at the center , pictured , he wanted to stay in @entity4 but they did not listen the reporter and a counselor helped him make contact with his grown daughter , and he moved to her home			1
he is now undergoing treatment			0
' i do n't want revenge , and i do n't know about justice , but i want them to pay for what they 've done to me and the others , ' @entity10 said			2
' i want people to really take a moment to think about this			0
' the @entity87 first shared @entity10 's story in march and discovered that the state has bought nearly 1,500 bus tickets for patients to nearly every state in the @entity113			2
@entity114 , who directs @entity4 's @entity115 , maintains that most of the tickets were for patients being met by family members or friends			0
documents : his medical records noted that he wanted to stay locally but he was still sent to @entity6 he told @entity33 that out of the 1,500 patients in the past five years , just 10 were inappropriately transported - but he would not say where they ended up			1
following a 10 - day internal review , he spoke at a legislative hearing and said that the probe found there was not a pattern of misconduct			0
among the report was findings that apparently relate to @entity10 's case , without naming him			0
it notes that , ' there was no documented evidence in the medical record that indicated how the patient could access mental health services ' or find a physician or a place to live			1
another example described a diabetic patient with bipolar disorder who was bused to @entity144 who had no medication or information on where to receive treatment for his diabetes			0
progress : the state 's policies have now been changed to ensure all patients travel with a chaperone he was also given ensure , but it was not a healthy for someone with diabetes , a nurse said			0
the findings have prompted @entity4 into action			0
gov. @entity162 announced on monday that the state had disciplined mental health employees			2
of nine workers at @entity12 who are implicated in the findings , four no longer work there , two have been terminated and three will face further disciplinary action , @entity33 found			0
the hospital 's policy is now to require chaperones for all bus trips			0

@entity10 told doctors at the @entity12 that he wanted to stay in @entity4 and did n't know anyone in @entity6

he ended up in a homeless shelter suffering from medication withdrawals
his case has *highlighted* ' patient dumping ' ; he is one of 10 mental health patients sent to states where they know no one
