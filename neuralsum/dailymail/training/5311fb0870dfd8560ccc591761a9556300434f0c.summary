there ’s an awful lot to see and do in @entity2 – but i ’m staying in the @entity5 hotel and it ’s sapping my motivation to go out and explore			2
it ’s a @entity8 of swankery that ’s hard to walk away from			2
first of all , there ’s my room			2
it ’s on a corner , 11 floors up , overlooking the streets of @entity18 ’s trendy @entity17 district – and it ’s mesmerising			1
two sides of the room are almost entirely formed of windows and when i arrive i spend a good while peering out of them at the district ’s jumble of offices , townhouses and designer shops			2
glass act : the corner bedroom suites at the @entity32 offer great views of @entity18 luxury : pay a bit more and you can have a room with a magnificent stand - alone bath trendy : the @entity41 bar is a magnet for @entity18 's trenderatti slightly frustratingly i ca n’t see any famous landmarks , but it ’s still an enticing @entity47 panorama			1
i ’m meeting two friends for a drink later so figure a quick shower is in order , but the shower nearly derails my timekeeping			2
it ’s a rain shower that ’s all the rage in quality hotels , but this one is like standing under a monsoon			1
it ’s magnificent and i ’m half - tempted to spend all evening amid the soothing cascade			1
the bathroom is very clean , modern – smothered in easy - on - the - eye tiles - and stocked with very generous quantities of organic shampoo , conditioner and body wash by @entity66			1
while crucially for bleary - eyed nighttime visits , it has a dimmer switch for the lights			1
take the plunge : there are great views from the rooftop pool , with the @entity75 visible to the south			1
picture courtesy of an @entity78 smiles better : @entity80 on the rooftop with the skyline in the background , pictured relaxing in one of the hotel 's bathrobes roof with a view : the jumbled rooftops of @entity17 as seen from the top of the hotel it ’s separated from the room by a glass wall , a style the hotel calls ‘ @entity96 ’			1
i just ca n’t fathom why anyone would want to be visible to their roommate – and the outside world – while sitting on the loo or wielding a loofer ( not supplied ) in the shower			2
fortunately the @entity5 has anticipated some of its guests harbouring conservative sensibilities			2
total privacy is assured by way of a screen that winds down efficiently at a touch of a button inside the bathroom			2
the exposure theme does n’t end there , because a bare concrete pillar is another distinctive feature of the room			0
i ’m not often wooed by industrial aesthetics but in this room it works – somehow giving the space a bit of extra artiness			0
of course , it helps that a huge flat - screen tv is attached to it			1
the room – the hotel calls it ‘ a corner studio ’ – comes with one enormous kingside bed			0
i ’m staying with my dear mother , so to accommodate us one of the in - room service attendants brings up a camp bed			1
it looks so incongruous in our otherwise chic surroundings that i half expect to have to sign a disclaimer promising that i wo n’t reveal that the hotel uses them			0
urban garden : the outdoor dining arrangement at the @entity5 is just superb enticing : the @entity5 ' urban garden ' has several levels and walkways a brand new feather - filled duvet for it is unwrapped in front of us - it ’s a camp bed , but a @entity153 of camp beds			1
i ’m meeting my chums at the top floor bar – called ‘ @entity41 ’ – which is blessed with the wow factor			1
several wow factors , actually			0
there ’s the view uptown – towards the empire state building			0
the view downtown - and the @entity75			1
standing on the decking with a glass of highly quaffable chenin blanc gazing at the sun setting over the @entity2 skyline is truly staggering			0
the bar , meanwhile , is staffed by two very able cocktail conjurers , dispensing liquor to what looks to be @entity17 ’s trenderatti , scattered hither and thither on upholstered cubes			1
it ’s a bar that attracts the well - heeled – and actual big heels			1
i revisit the pool for an early morning dip the following day – and it ’s just as magical without the aid of a wine haze			0
the pool is really only big enough for a handful of people , though , so pick your moments for a swim			0
the @entity5 ’ in - house eating options are as magnetic as its rooftop delights			1
the restaurant – the @entity193 - is named after the celebrity chef that bears ultimate responsibility for the standard of fodder			1
the hotel is clearly proud of the collaboration , with the restaurant given lashings of hype on its website			1
the confidence certainly is n’t misplaced			0
the excellent cooking is on the rustic side , with a bit of artistry and flair thrown in for good measure			0
starters include @entity214 maple bacon dates , chicken dumplings and cornbread crusted oysters			0
diners can choose from such delights as heritage pork , salt brick beef and red snapper for mains			0
high life : the @entity5 rises up 29 floors above @entity18 's trendy @entity17 district corking : the impressive hotel lobby , where free wine and cheese is served between 6 and 8pm @entity229 : the @entity193 's coconut trifle i plump for a delicious and refreshing tomato and watermelon gazpacho for my starter with chicken and @entity237 peas for my main course			1
for dessert i opt for a sumptuous coconut trifle served in a jam jar			0
the wine list is nothing short of sensational , with a frankly astonishing range of grape - based liquor on offer			1
the cellar harbours everything from the highly drinkable and affordable to legendary reds such as @entity252 and what some might regard as one of the finest white wines in the world – @entity257			0
you ’ll need deep pockets , for these , though			0
what makes eating at the @entity5 extra special are the seating options			0
it ’s a gourmand ’s playground			0
you can dine indoors in a stylish loft - type space , or outside , as we did , in a sort of urban garden			1
it has multiple levels with walkways and steps leading to variously sized dining areas all surrounded by lush foliage			1
there ’s a bar in there somewhere , too			1
note - map and compass recommended			2
extricate yourself from @entity283 ’ and you ’ll find the surrounding area has plenty going for it			2
@entity17 is in that bit of @entity2 without skyscapers in between the bits with skyscrapers ( @entity291 and @entity292 )			0
designer shops such as @entity294 and @entity295 nestle in nearby streets , along with culinary hotspots such as @entity298 and @entity299			0
@entity300 - where a myriad of @entity2 characters gather to relax by the fountain , play chess and eat ice cream - is also just a few minutes away on foot			2
@entity307 : a wall made up entirely of computer keys in the entrance to the hotel five reasons to stay at the @entity313 : we spend 30 minutes there listening to a busker playing an actual grand piano that he ’d wheeled into the park			1
no city tires you out quite like the frenetic @entity47			0
fortunately , my bed is more than equal to the task of leaving me rested and refreshed , ready for more urban adventures			0
it ’s supremely comfortable with luxuriously soft pillows			0
fuelling up with breakfast at the @entity193 turns out to be an experience almost as gourmet in nature as dinner			1
just - right eggs benedict is served up with lashings of smooth coffee and a quirky grapefruit brulee – think crème brulee , but with the caramel covering halves of grapefruit – that proves a winner with @entity341			2
the hotel does all the basics really well – clean comfortable rooms , great food , first - class bathroom experiences , superb location and , in case you were wondering , very courteous staff			1
crucially , there ’s also free – and very fast – @entity352			0
there are flourishes here , though , that propel the @entity5 from being a good hotel to a great hotel			2
the intriguing urban garden dining experience i ’ve already mentioned , but there are also pleasing touches such as free – highly quaffable – wine with cheese and biscuits served in the lobby every evening , bowls of food and water laid out by the entrance for guests ’ dogs and modern art peppered along the corridors			2
i particularly like the wall by the entrance covered with computer keys			0
it ’s no wonder that the @entity377 - there are also hotels in @entity380 and @entity381 - attracts celebrities such as @entity383 , @entity384 and @entity385			1
yes , it 's got glass - walled bathrooms , but my love for this place is utterly transparent			1
rates at the @entity313 start from £ 216 per room per night on a @entity393 basis , excluding taxes			1
@entity395 is based on double occupancy			0
