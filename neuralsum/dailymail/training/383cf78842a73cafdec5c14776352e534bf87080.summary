coconuts could play a key role in making non-polluting cars that only emit water , a reality			1
for years , scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen , but are unsure how to store the substance effectively			1
now , they may be close to solving this problem using the unlikely candidate			0
researchers from @entity13 ’s @entity12 have used coconut kernels ( pictured ) to store hydrogen			1
they say the material is plentiful , cheap and easily be converted into carbon researchers from @entity13 ’s @entity12 used coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form , @entity17 reported			1
storing liquid hydrogen is notoriously difficult as it must be held at extremely low temperatures , which is expensive and tricky in the confines of a car			2
to store it in its gaseous state , would mean that vehicles would have to be fitted with large , pressurised tanks , which is not practical			2
so instead , experts have focused on finding materials , such as carbon , which can absorb hydrogen and release it on demand			1
scientists have been working on developing hydrogen - powered cars for two decades			1
they only emit water and heat , instead of pollutants			0
@entity40 - @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity42 have joined forces with the ambitious aim of bringing an affordable car to market in four years ’ time and @entity49 's @entity48 ( pictured ) is being trialled professor @entity52 and his team , at the university ’s @entity50 created carbon from coconut kernels , which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium , magnesium and sodium			1
he says that the kernels , which are easily found , are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon			1
‘ unlike graphene , carbon nano tubes ( @entity65 ) and other type of carbons , the production of carbon from solid endosperm is not time taking , he wrote in a research paper			1
‘ therefore , its cost - effectiveness , good adsorption capacity and easy availability are its advantageous factors in regard to hydrogen storage			1
’ the researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘ considerable ’ amount of hydrogen			1
the @entity83 @entity82 predicts that hydrogen storage systems will need a capacity of at least 5.5 weight per cent to be commercially viable and it could be a while until this is demonstrated on a large scale			0

@entity91 is developing a $ 69,000 ( £ 43,350 ) car using the technology , called the @entity94 and @entity40 - @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity42 have joined forces with the ambitious aim of bringing an affordable car to market in four years ’ time			2
this week , engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor which , when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant , would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output			0
until now no - one has come up with a fusion power plant design – dubbed the ‘ holy grail ’ of energy generation by many - that would produce fuel cheap enough to outperform systems that use fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas			1
‘ right now , this design has the greatest potential of producing economical fusion power of any current concept , ’ said @entity116 , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the @entity119			2
engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor ( pictured ) that , when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant , would rival costs for a new coal - fired plant with similar electrical output the design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur - allowing the hot plasma to react and burn			0
the reactor itself would be largely self - sustaining , meaning it would continuously heat the plasma to maintain thermonuclear conditions			0
heat generated from the reactor would heat up a coolant that is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity , similar to how a typical power reactor works			0
mr @entity147 said : ‘ this is a much more elegant solution because the medium in which you generate fusion is the medium in which you ’re also driving all the current required to confine it			0
’ there are several ways to create a magnetic field , which is crucial for keeping a fusion reactor going			0
the new design is known as a spheromak , meaning it generates the majority of magnetic fields by driving electrical currents into the plasma itself			0
this reduces the amount of required materials and allows researchers to shrink the overall size of the reactor			2
the researchers estimated the cost of building a fusion reactor power plant using their design compared to building a coal power plant			0
they explained that building a fusion power plant producing 1 gigawatt ( 1 billion watts ) of power would cost $ 2.7 billion ( £ 1.7 billion ) , while a coal plant of the same output would cost $ 2.8 billion ( £ 1.8 billion ) , according to their analysis			0
mr @entity147 said : ‘ if we do invest in this type of fusion , we could be rewarded because the commercial reactor unit already looks economical			0

researchers have used coconut kernels to store hydrogen , taking a step closer to making clean fuel cell cars affordable
experts , from @entity13 ’s @entity12 turn the kernels into carbon
kernels contain fatty acids , as well as potassium , magnesium and sodium
they are plentiful , cheap and easily be converted into carbon , experts say
researchers found the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘ considerable ’ amount of hydrogen
