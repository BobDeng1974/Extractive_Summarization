by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 15 april 2013 drug addicts will be able to inject themselves with crack and heroin in ' safe rooms ' as part of a scheme being considered by @entity8 's drugs death capital			1
@entity9 is set to become the first city in the @entity8 to provide official ' drug consumption rooms ' where addicts can use heroin , crack and cocaine under supervision without fear of prosecution			1
public health leaders in the city will meet this summer to give serious consideration to the plan which they say will ' save lives			1
' ' safe room ' : @entity9 health officials hope that supervision will reduce the risk of overdoses and public drugtaking last year @entity9 and @entity28 was once again named and shamed as the drug death capital of the @entity8			1
figures ranked the city worst in the country for drug - related fatalities per head of population with 104 fatalities between 2009 and 2011			2
of the 35 deaths in 2010 , 13 were the result of heroin overdoses and in 2009 promising medical student @entity40 died after taking a legal high called @entity42			0
it is estimated that around 2,000 people in the city have a serious substance abuse issues			0
@entity46 , chairman of @entity9 's health and wellbeing board - the local authority agency given responsibility for public health under recent @entity53 reforms - said previous strategies had failed to tackle the problem			1
he told a sunday newspaper that recent drug tackling policies in the city were tantamount to ' emotional knee - jerk reactions ' that had not stopped users killing themselves			2
keen supporter : local mp @entity61 of the @entity62 believes the rooms would be an important innovation he said : ' i think from our perspective we see the health benefits of accepting drug use is going to happen and it might as well be happening in a place that can be monitored			1
' our primary concern is the health of the people to make sure they do n't kill themselves			2
' mr @entity46 added : ' i believe in @entity76 , where it has been tried , it has worked			0
' up until now we have had policies that have been based on emotional knee - jerk reactions that have n't solved the problem at all			0
' the proposals were put forward by a drugs commission headed by crime author @entity83 and @entity84 , a former @entity8 deputy drugs tsar			2
a report published by the independent body this week is expected to say that the drug consumption rooms would ' significantly reduce overdose death rates ' and would not encourage further use			1
the commission was established following the prompting of local @entity92 mp , @entity61			1
mrs @entity61 said that while the facilities would push at the fringes of the law , it could be an important innovation			2
' @entity97 is n't working , ' she said			0
' this is a government that often says it wants to be guided by evidence and yet drugs policy is more or less an evidence - free zone			0
' more than 90 drug consumption rooms have been set up worldwide , including in @entity76 , the @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
mr @entity84 , vice chairman of the commission , said eradication of illegal drug use was not now a realistic aim and management should now be the priority			0
he said : ' a lot of drug partnerships around the country are doing good things but none of them have been able to get the drugs market under control			0
similar set - up : the @entity122 supervised injection center in @entity124 , @entity125 where addicts can inject in safe surroundings ' so we need to look for realistic objectives : ways of managing the market rather than eradicating the market			2
' it is difficult for political leaders and executives within the police but you have to be honest about the situation			0
' we are not going to do anything to make illegal drug use go away but there are things we can do to resolve health and crime problems			2
' previously @entity145 , chief executive of the @entity146 , which runs the city 's largest drug and alcohol treatment service blamed the drug problem on ' anything goes night time culture			0
' he said : ' we have to ask ourselves as a city whether we want to continue with this awful tag			0
drug deaths : @entity9 and @entity28 has been named the drug death capital of @entity8 for the second year in a row ' although people are enjoying the night time economy , there are victims too and that needs to change			1
' however , we are seeing a better integration of services in @entity9 and @entity28 then we have ever seen before and the drop in deaths reflects that			1
but even one death is one too many			0
' @entity171 , from @entity174 's mental health and addiction research group , said a study in @entity124 showed that public injections were reduced by 50 % near the city 's drug consumption room			1
he claimed there had never been an overdose in such a facility anywhere in the world			0
@entity183 , ceo of the @entity8 drugs charity @entity184 said : ' there is significant evidence internationally that drug consumption rooms can help address the health and social harms associated with problem drug use - including reducing the risk of overdose , improving health and lessening costs to society			1
' we support the piloting and evaluation of drug consumption rooms as a contribution to improving public health and reducing drug - related harms			1
' the proposals are due to be considered in june .			0

@entity9 and @entity28 is the drug death capital of @entity8
health officials are considering the ' drug consumption rooms ' to ' save lives '
