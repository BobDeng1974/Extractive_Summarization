@entity0 has certainly not held back since becoming a crusader against global capitalism			1
he has called for an ‘ orgy ’ of banker bashing , urged people to refuse to pay taxes and called profit a ‘ filthy word ’			1
but he appears to have no problem with raising nearly £ 1million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers and a @entity13 footballer to make a documentary about himself			1
@entity0 has launched repeated attacks on bankers and called for debt to be abolished in his new book but it emerged today that the company behind his new film has been bankrolled by city financiers			1

his public pronouncements on bankers – whom he wants to be punished for their role in the financial crisis – have been rather more outspoken			1
‘ i think an orgy of any kind would be great , but one that focuses on banker bashing would be the best kind , ’ he told @entity39 ’s @entity38 last year			1
he has also declared on @entity46 : ‘ @entity47 says profit is n’t a dirty word			2
well i say profit is a filthy word			2
’ these trenchant positions are at odds with his use of venture capital to finance the upcoming film			1
the film funded by investors is a documentary in which @entity0 calls on fans not to ' comply ' with the system company documents list @entity0 as a director of @entity64 since his ' appointment ' in july 2010			1
other directors are listed as @entity0 's manager , @entity67 , the best man at his wedding , @entity67 and @entity69			1

one leading accountant , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ he ’s being a capitalist , but he then goes on @entity46 and rants about how terrible capitalism is			0
i would challenge his hypocrisy			0
’ a source said @entity0 did not benefit from any tax relief because he is not an investor in the company			1
brand hit out at bankers during an appearance on the @entity39 's @entity38 , calling for them to ' go down ' the @entity39 gave @entity0 many platforms to publicise his book revolution – but rarely challenged his claims			1
it took website @entity115 to find a professor , @entity116 of the @entity117 , to assess his work			0
@entity119 : ‘ i would n’t worry too much about exporting them , as other countries have their own f * * * ing cars			0
’ @entity128 : ‘ it ’s hard to see how one could come up with a sillier thought			0
a 30 - second search on @entity125 will tell you fewer than 50 countries make cars			0
’ on the financial industry : ‘ if my vacuum cleaner went nuts and forced me to live in economic slavery , i would n’t roll my eyes and say “ oh well ” and humbly do its bidding			0
i ’d turn it off and f * * * it out the window			0
’ the professor : ‘ is the industry really like a vacuum cleaner ? how does one turn it off ? or throw it out the window ? @entity148 : ‘ cancelling personal debt would stimulate the economy more than any “ too big to fail ” bank quantitative easing			2
’ the professor : ‘ mr @entity0 is quite confused			1
quantitative easing is neither necessary nor sufficient for stopping a bank or any other corporation from failing			0
’ @entity154 corporations : ‘ if they do n’t pay tax , we ’ll reclaim their assets and give them to the people who work there to run			0
’ the professor : ‘ what does he mean ? most corporations are owned by shareholders			0
if you take the assets away from them … you will deprive millions of their income , and perhaps their livelihood			0
’ on the nation state : ‘ it may have served its purpose and have to be dissolved – it ’s not a big deal			0
’ the professor : ‘ i have no idea what he means here			0
how is this to be done ? ’ @entity177 : ‘ the spiritual revolution , the revolution we are about to realise , will be fast because the organisms are in place			0
’ the professor : ‘ if the revolution advocated is a spiritual transformation , what is one to make of the authoritarian element of the manifesto ? it sounds like the new society is going to have an awful lot of confiscating , and forbidding – stopping people from exporting , or fracking , or building up capital			0
’ @entity0 was mocked this weekend after he appeared in a corporate box at a @entity193 match			1
rather than sit among fellow fans , the comedian was seen standing among suited businessman behind the glass of a hospitality suite			2
footballer @entity199 joked about @entity0 on @entity200 , posting : ' @entity0			1
starting his revolution from the executive boxes			0
