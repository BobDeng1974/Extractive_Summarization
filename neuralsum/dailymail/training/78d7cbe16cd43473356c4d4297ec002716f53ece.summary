the monies brought through the doors at @entity2 and @entity3 over the summer were notably similar ; so too the cash spent on new signings			1
what 's killed off any hope of @entity8 challenging for the title is the difference in quality of those incoming			1
it does n't make pretty reading for @entity8 supporters , who felt they were on their way to a first @entity17 crown when this pair last met in april			1
it had looked for all the world they 'd seal it , but that came tumbling down with @entity25 's strike and @entity27 's merry dance			1
since then the @entity28 have gone backwards - and markedly so			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity8 recouped over £ 60million in a deal that saw @entity32 sign for @entity33 in the summer @entity34 was always going to find replacing star striker @entity32 difficult @entity35 ( £ 10m ) @entity36 ( £ 16m ) @entity37 ( £ 25m ) @entity38 ( £ 20m ) @entity39 ( £ 12m ) @entity40 ( £ 10m ) @entity41 ( £ 10m ) @entity42 ( £ 4m ) afforded a wealth of money to revamp their entire squad after the sale of @entity32 to @entity33 , @entity34 has so far failed miserably			1
the spine of @entity50 's impressive side to have finished eighth last season was picked apart by the @entity52			2
@entity42 , @entity37 and @entity35 all penned deals			0
fine , you 'd think , if this was a team to have ended the previous campaign seventh and needed to kick on			0
unfortunately for @entity8 , these signings came a year too late			2
certainly not those of a side who had designs of the title			0
these mistakes cost them a pretty penny , too			0
@entity37 is yet to impact a game from midfield , @entity42 is used as a substitute only and @entity35 just does n't have the positional awareness of a top central defender			2
@entity34 does n't seem to have made the most of his summer spending money @entity34 raided @entity50 's squad , signing @entity42 ( left ) and @entity37 the @entity3 club signed former @entity50 defender @entity35 ( right ) for £ 10million whether @entity34 is now questioning the wisdom of splashing around £ 50million on a trio of players with absolutely no experience of challenging for titles and just one with previous in the @entity81 is unknown			1
but you 'd have to imagine he 's at least pondered whether the biggest opportunity of his managerial career has been squandered in a flurry of giddy excitement with chequebook in hand			0
@entity89 ( £ 30m ) @entity90 ( £ 32m ) @entity91 ( £ 16m ) @entity92 ( free ) @entity93 ( £ 10m ) the most galling aspect of their struggles since august is that the war chest was mismanaged to such an extent that @entity99 have shown them up horribly			1
they too recouped around £ 75m thanks to the sales of @entity104 to @entity105 and @entity106 to @entity107 , but spent it wisely			0
see @entity90 and @entity89 - arguably the best players in the division			0
perhaps @entity34 ' perception of his club is n't aligned with what they achieved last year			2
why , with the millions at their disposal , did he not try and land players to have a real impact on the @entity17 and @entity119 ? @entity36 has struggled to make an impact since his £ 16million move from @entity122 @entity99 managed to collect £ 50m from @entity105 for the signature of @entity124 defender @entity104 at one stage , @entity93 looked set to sign for @entity8 , but ended up sealing a deal to @entity2 whether @entity90 would have fancied the north - west over @entity128 is debatable , but @entity8 needed to do more than roll a £ 16m dice on @entity36			1
by contrast , the @entity130 secured their top targets and added @entity91 from @entity133 as well			0
@entity93 - whose move to @entity8 collapsed after a medical - was allowed to join the league leaders			2
used largely as a substitute , the @entity137 could have offered so much more from the start for @entity34			0
the individual prices paid for @entity90 and @entity89 are higher than splashed by @entity8 , proving it 's more efficient to spend extra money on one player and sign fewer than to accumulate numbers who are n't going to have an impact			1
@entity90 , signed for £ 32million , has scored nine @entity17 goals so far this season @entity89 has been arguably the best signing of the summer , grabbing nine assists for his new team @entity27 did n't have to spend a penny to re-sign club legend @entity92 ( above )			1

@entity34 has failed to make the most of £ *75million* *transfer* kitty
@entity8 have struggled to replace star striker @entity32
@entity36 has n't made an impact since £ 16million move
@entity8 face @entity99 in @entity17 at *12.45pm* on *saturday* at @entity3
@entity27 has said *tauntingly* said that @entity163 's slip in last season 's corresponding *fixture* cost @entity8 the @entity17 title
