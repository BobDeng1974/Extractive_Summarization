by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:11 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 22:15 est , 7 june 2012 defending the @entity2 : @entity3 accused @entity4 and the @entity5 of holding ' deeply pessimistic ' of national identity the majority of @entity9 and @entity10 people want to save the @entity2 and prevent @entity12 becoming independent , it was revealed today			1
only one in three asked by pollsters said they would be happy if their northern neighbours left the @entity16			2
the new survey by @entity18 asked whether @entity12 should be separate and independent , and two out of three said no. its result flies in the face of claims that most @entity9 and @entity10 would be happy not to ' subsidise ' @entity12 , as some critics have claimed happens			1
@entity25 said when asked if they agreed @entity12 should be separate from the rest of the @entity16 and become independent , 28 per cent agreed , 57 per cent disagreed and 15 per cent did n't know			1
and only one in five pensioners wanted @entity12 to gain independence			2
it came as @entity32 leader @entity3 launched an attack on @entity4 and @entity12 nationalists in a speech hailing patriotism and defending the @entity2			1
mr @entity3 criticised the @entity38 presenter for ‘ shrugging his shoulders ’ at the prospect of @entity12 breaking away from the @entity16			1
he accused the likes of mr @entity4 and the @entity5 of holding ‘ deeply pessimistic ’ and ‘ narrow ’ views of national identity and warn that it is a ‘ false choice ’ to ask people whether they want to be @entity12 or @entity16 in the referendum that is expected in 2014			1
mr @entity4 used his newspaper column in january to proclaim : ‘ if the @entity12 people want to break away , then i shall stand on @entity50 with a teary handkerchief , and say , “ good riddance to the lot of you , and take your stupid bagpipes with you ”			0
’ scroll down to watch @entity3 's speech controversial : top gear presenter @entity4 used his newspaper column in january to declare how he would say ' good riddance ' to @entity12 people if they chose to break away from the @entity2 in a speech at the @entity61 in @entity62 , the @entity32 leader warned against a retreat into narrow nationalism within the @entity16 and call for a progressive patriotism which embraces the mixed identities of modern @entity16			1
he said : ‘ the nationalists of the @entity5 pose a false choice			0
they ask : are you @entity12 or @entity16 ? i say you can be both			1
and here in @entity9 there are people like @entity4 who shrug their shoulders at the prospect of the break - up of the @entity2			0
‘ it ’s a mistake wherever you find it			0
having to say @entity12 or @entity16 , @entity10 or @entity16 , @entity9 or @entity16			1
i do n’t accept any of that			0
it ’s always a false choice			0
' we in the @entity32 have been too reluctant to talk about @entity9 in recent years , as if somehow talking about @entity9 is a threat to the @entity16			1
' somehow , while there has been a lot of romanticism on the left about @entity12 identity and @entity10 identity , @entity9 identity has just tended to be a completely closed book , something that people have shied away from			1
' why is that ? i think it 's partly because people have been nervous that it undermines the union , but also because it was connected for some people with the kind of nationalism that left people ill at ease			0
' winning : @entity3 said @entity9 's run at @entity104 had helped reclaim a sense of national identity he said the @entity107 had been reclaimed from the @entity108 and the @entity104 football tournament reclaimed the @entity9 flag			1
but there was still ' nervousness ' and polling showed some people still associated the @entity115 with racism			0
' that 's not my view , i think we should be proud of the flag of @entity122 , i think we should applaud people who fly it			0
' he urged the @entity12 to back the @entity126 yesterday - and then said he would n't mind if @entity127 backed @entity128 instead			2
the @entity32 leader risked ridicule over mixed messages as he made a speech on national identity			0
mr @entity3 said the @entity9 football team would need all the help it can get at the @entity136 which begins on @entity137			1
but his attempt to keep everyone happy only risked offending everyone			0
in answer to a question about whether @entity12 should support @entity9 , he added : ' @entity9 needs as many supporters as it can get in these championships but i do n't think it makes them un-british if they do n't support it			1
that 's what 's important about national identity			0
' in a message to first minister @entity151 , he said : ' economic progress is not going to be achieved through @entity12 leaving the @entity16 and simply being part of @entity154			1
' it 's going to be achieved with @entity12 part of the @entity16			2
our identities , our economies , are too intertwined to believe anything else			0
' @entity161 will come when the @entity16 works together , not pulls apart			0
' admitting that his party has been ‘ ill at ease ’ discussing nationalism in recent years , mr @entity3 said : ‘ for too long people have believed that to express @entity9 identity is to undermine the @entity2			2
at the same time we have helped express @entity12 identity within the @entity2			0
‘ this does not make sense			0
you can be proudly @entity12 and @entity16			2
and you can be proudly @entity9 and @entity16 , as i am			2

new poll finds two out of three do n't want @entity12 to leave the @entity16
@entity3 : the @entity9 should be proud of the @entity115
