by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 31 january 2013 @entity1 , chairman of @entity2 , said she was ' fundamentally opposed ' to same - sex marriage and predicted it would have negative consequences for ' families and children ' @entity9 traditionalists in the @entity10 are preparing to back gay marriage despite continuing anger among the party ’s grassroots			1
justice secretary @entity15 , one of the government ’s most senior right - wingers , indicated yesterday he will vote in favour of legalising same - sex unions next week , while @entity20 , who has previously expressed concern , also revealed she is to back the reform			1
work and pensions secretary @entity23 , the standard bearer for the @entity25 , is expected to abstain rather than vote against , and may even back the legislation , according to friends			1
some other @entity10 critics are expected to contrive to miss a @entity31 debate on gay marriage rather than vote against			2
environment secretary @entity34 is the most implacably opposed member of the @entity10 , according to @entity36 sources			2
whips expect around 60 per cent of conservative mps to vote in favour of gay marriage , and around 40 per cent – 120 mps – oppose it in a free vote			2
in an indication of the ongoing anger in @entity9 ranks at the reform , which has been championed by @entity45 , one conservative council chairman launched a strong attack on the party leadership			2
@entity1 , chairman of @entity2 , said she was ‘ fundamentally opposed ’ to same - sex marriage and predicted it would have negative consequences for ‘ families and children ’			1
mrs @entity1 told @entity55 from the @entity56 there were ‘ lots of gays in the media ’ , which meant that ‘ if anybody speaks out , you ’re rubbished ’			0
in an interview recorded at an event staffed by the @entity68 , which is campaigning against the government ’s plans , she added : ‘ it is not a question of religion , it is a question of our natural beings			0
‘ it ’s a question of being educated about our whole humanity , the history of humanity			0
playing around with that just from the point of view of an equalisation does n’t make sense for families and for children			0
’ mrs @entity1 said she was ‘ disappointed ’ with education secretary @entity87 , who represents a @entity89 seat , for pushing the equal marriage legislation			0
justice secretary @entity15 , left , and @entity20 , right , will vote in favour of legalising same - sex marriages next week ‘ why the hell should they [ pro-gay marriage conservatives ] make up their minds about something ? we have been in a particular party for longer than they have , probably before they were born ... ‘ they ’re kids on the block in some ways and it annoys me that they can be so clever about it without talking to everybody			1
it ’s a bit orwellian			0
do we have the right to speak out anymore in this country without being dissed by anybody , without being sneered at by the @entity112 ? there are lots of gays in the media that if anybody speaks out , you ’re rubbished			0
’ the councillor added : ‘ i am , by the way , absolutely in favour of equal treatment for gays , both lesbians and gays , and the civil partnership			0
’ @entity20 , who is minister for faith , confirmed she planned to vote in favour of plans to legalise gay marriage as long as churches and other faith groups are properly protected			1
a spokesman for mr @entity15 , who caused controversy in the last election campaign when he spoke in favour of bed and breakfast owners who wanted to be able to turn away homosexual guests , said he would also vote in favour .			1

justice secretary @entity15 and @entity20 will vote in favour
