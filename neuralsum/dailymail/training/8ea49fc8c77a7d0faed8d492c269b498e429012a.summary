by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 will use celebrated psychiatrist dr @entity2 for his own mental preparation at the @entity5 finals — and is hoping his players are open - minded enough to follow suit			1
@entity2 has worked with @entity8 this season and has been enthusiastically endorsed by the likes of sir @entity11 and @entity12 after his work with the @entity16 @entity15 cycling squad			1
he will join the @entity18 squad in @entity19 next week and remain with them throughout the @entity5			1
‘ i ’d like to think the players will be open to it , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ we ’re not obliging players to see him			0
i ’m sure the @entity8 players will tell the others how they interact with him and what he does for them			2
useful : @entity30 ( left ) and other members of the @entity8 squad have worked with dr @entity2 this season @entity34 words : psychiatrist dr @entity2 will travel with the @entity18 squad to the @entity5 option : @entity18 players including @entity39 ( centre ) will get the chance to speak to dr @entity2 in @entity43 ‘ i ’m sure , as a result , a few of the other players will come up and say : “ that ’s interesting , i ’d like him to have a chat with me , too ”			1
@entity30 and @entity50 are two @entity8 players who will also be in @entity1 ’s squad and have spoken about @entity2 ’ role			1
and despite a week in which his most high - profile clients — @entity8 and @entity56 — suffered significant setbacks , @entity2 is highly respected in the sport world			1
although @entity1 insists that his role will not just be about converting penalties , @entity2 is likely to address that issue with players			1
‘ i ’m not thrusting @entity2 on the players , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ if we win or lose on penalties , it wo n’t be because @entity2 has joined us			2
‘ but there may be a penalty taker who has spent a bit of time with him , who takes a better penalty			0
but it ’s not his responsibility at all			0
’ @entity2 ’ work is explained in a book called the @entity78 , in which he encourages people to understand how anxiety works in their mind , and explains that , for many people , their first response is an emotional one — similar to that which a chimpanzee might make			2
@entity1 added : ‘ he will have a lot more work to do with me because at my age , unfortunately , my inner chimp has become very mischievous , ’ said @entity1			2
faith : @entity18 boss @entity1 believes dr @entity2 will benefit his squad in @entity93 been there , done that : @entity96 is no stranger to @entity5 heartbreak with @entity18 ‘ the difficulty is always when you read psychologist ’s books , it ’s not difficult to accept what they ’re saying and to see the sense and benefits in it			1
‘ the problem is when you ’re in real life : can you find the right behaviour pattern that ’s required at the time ? that ’s the difficult thing			0
‘ as @entity2 is always very quick to point out , our first reaction is always emotional and then the human side kicks in			0
he may help us control that emotional side better than we can			0
‘ i ’ve always thought people like @entity2 — who are close to teams — can do as much of a job with the coaching team as they can with the players , because we have a big influence on the players			2
‘ if they can help us get the right mind - set to say the right thing at the right time — take the pressure off whenever we can , put the pressure on when it ’s necessary — that in itself would be beneficial			0
i have an open mind to it all			0
i ’m looking forward to hearing what he ’s got to say			0
’ experienced : dr @entity2 has worked with with sportspeople including @entity12 and the @entity138 cycling team impact : dr @entity2 has helped @entity140 and @entity8 mount a title challenge this season @entity142 has said his biggest regret with @entity18 was not taking a sports psychiatrist with him to the 2006 @entity5 finals to help the team cope — especially with penalties			1
@entity1 says that it would have been remiss of him not to take advantage of @entity2 ’ expertise			1
‘ i was fortunate enough to be put in contact with him and found out he was a massive @entity18 fan and would be more than happy to help out in any way he could , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i read his book , which i found fascinating			0
i know he ’s done excellent work with @entity155 , at @entity156 , who is a friend of mine and told me a lot about him , and at @entity8 , with @entity140 and @entity30 in particular			2
mistake : former @entity18 boss @entity142 regrets not taking a sports psychiatrist to the 2006 @entity5 relationship : @entity50 ( left ) has worked with dr @entity2 at @entity8 this season ‘ when he was prepared to make himself available , i ’d have been very foolish not to take advantage of that			1
but there ’s no pressure on him whatsoever			0
‘ he already works at @entity8 with some of the players , so i ’m sure they ’ll talk to him when he ’s around , just as they do at @entity8			0
i ’ve got a very curious group of players , an open - minded group of players			0
‘ i would n’t be at all surprised if quite a few others wanted to come and speak to him and find out what he ’s got to say — how they can better prepare mentally for matches			0
