by @entity0 published : 12:35 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 5 october 2012 for @entity3 and @entity4 users exasperated by @entity6 's maps app , it could come as a welcome relief			1
@entity8 today dramatically updated its web - based maps app - which @entity3 users can access through their phone 's web browser			1
the search giant made its @entity15 product available on mobile web browsers in a bid to lure users away from apple 's maps service , which has come under fire from users for its poor maps and distorted images			1
the @entity15 service now works on both @entity4 ( shown here ) and @entity3 - without users having to download an app the maps include all of @entity15 's data , including the ability to walk round inside certain venues , such as this @entity35 bar			1
to use @entity15 on your mobile browser simply go to maps.google.com and search for a location			2
then click the ' pegman ' icon at the bottom right of your screen to access @entity15			2
@entity42 by clicking on the ' pegman ' icon			0
for quick access to @entity44 on @entity46 devices , you can save a bookmark to your home screen			0
simply click ' save to @entity50 ' on the bottom of the page when you ’re in @entity44			0
' to make @entity44 even more comprehensive , accurate and useful , today we ’re making @entity15 available on mobile browsers , ' @entity54 , product manager @entity44 wrote			2
' with access to @entity15 on your phone , you can use panoramic , street - level imagery to explore and navigate the places around you , even on the go			1
' the move is aimed squarely at @entity6 , which was last weeks forced to admit its own version of the @entity44 apps was a failure			0
@entity8 is believed to be working on a map app of its own after @entity6 dumped it from the built in maps app on @entity4 and iphones			1
in a letter published on @entity6 's website , ceo @entity71 said the firm ' fell short ' on the product , and was ' extremely sorry '			0
' at @entity6 , we strive to make world - class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers , ' he wrote			1
' with the launch of our new maps last week , we fell short on this commitment			0
' we are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make maps better			0
' mr @entity71 took the unprecedented step of advising users that other products were available			0
' while we ’re improving maps , you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the @entity94 like @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , or use @entity8 or @entity99 maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app. ' the firm also changed the description of the @entity44 app on its site , removing references to it being the ' most beautiful , powerful mapping service ever '			1
a difficult road ahead : @entity6 's maps have been slammed for their poor location information and distorted images , forcing the company into issuing an apology .			2

service makes @entity15 available once again to @entity4 and @entity3 users - without the need to download an app
comes as @entity6 *continues* to *struggle* to improve its own maps app
