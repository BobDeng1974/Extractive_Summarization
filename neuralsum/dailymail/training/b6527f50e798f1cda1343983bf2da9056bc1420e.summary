by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 14:18 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 28 june 2013 for 12 year - old @entity5 each tentative , nervous , deliberate movement of her feet was a step into the unknown			0
three months ago she had been unable to walk at all and faced a desperate future in @entity9 with little prospect of help or ever being able to marry and raise a family because she was born with the deformity of bilateral clubbed feet			1
but today supported gently and encouraged in each step by @entity17 aid worker @entity16 she was able to walk around a rose - lined garden in a suburb of the @entity9 capital @entity1 before resting on the seat of a swing watched with delight by her mother @entity25			1
inspirational : @entity17 aid worker @entity16 pictured with some of the disabled @entity9 children she has been helping at @entity28 , a charity bringing medical treatment to the country 's poorest youngsters legacy : the work of @entity34 is being supported by foundations set up in memory of @entity37 , left , 36 , who was kidnapped by the @entity39 and killed in october 2010 as @entity40 tried to rescue her , and dr @entity41 , right , also 36 , who was shot dead months earlier in an attack still shrouded in mystery ‘ to us this is a miracle , a gift of life … a return to the type of life everyone should be able to live , ’ the smiling 29 year - old mother - of - five said			1
‘ we did not think that she would ever be able to walk freely like this – and on her own			0
’ the words ‘ miracle ’ and ‘ gift of life ’ are regularly used by the families of some 35 @entity9 youngsters receiving treatment at @entity59 , a @entity61 - run project in @entity1 , that provides surgery , medical care and a peaceful sanctuary during recovery for patients and their families from all over @entity9			1
it is a remarkable and inspirational project which is being backed by foundations set - up in the memory of two equally remarkable and inspirational @entity17 women killed while they tried to help the women and children in the most impoverished areas of rural @entity9			1
help : ms @entity16 sits with , from left , @entity79 , 13 , a heart surgery patient , @entity5 , 12 , who suffered from club feet , and @entity82 , 13 , a spinal surgery patient , all of whose treatments were paid for by the @entity86 so far the treatment and care for @entity5 and 14 other children have been paid for by grants from the @entity91 established in memory of the 36 year - old doctor , from @entity94 , @entity95 , who was kidnapped and murdered in august 2010 in the remote mountainous @entity97 to the north east of the war ravaged country			1
a former dancer and model , dr @entity103 , who specialised in providing maternal and neonatal care , was on her third visit to @entity9 when she and nine other aid workers were ambushed in an attack initially blamed on the @entity39 but still shrouded in mystery			1
a further eight of the children are being helped thanks to the financial backing provided by the @entity113 set - up in memory of the 36 year - old @entity116 aid worker , who died in october 2010 in a failed pre-dawn rescue by @entity40 after being kidnapped by the @entity39 in @entity118 , eastern @entity9			1
finding her feet : @entity5 has had three operations to correct her club feet to enable her to walk for the first time			0
doctors expect that within six months she will be able to walk freely without pain or difficulties ‘ it is so very sad what happened to two special women who were doing so much to help the people of @entity9 but i am sure they would have been pleased that part of their legacy would be they were continuing to help the children , women and families of this country , ’ said ms @entity16 , @entity127 for @entity128 , the organisation behind @entity59			1
the 57 - year - old , from @entity147 , @entity148 , continued : ‘ when @entity150 came here she would play with the children , they loved her and there was a bond – the rural children were very close to her and @entity37 ’s hearts ... they helped so many of them in so many ways			2
‘ both were caring young women who gave so much to improve these little people ’s lives and i am sure they would have been very proud of what is being done in their names			2
‘ while it is incredibly sad these foundations exist because both girls have died , we are delighted their families have the confidence in us and in our work to back us			2
their support is changing lives immeasurably for the better , the success in each individual case provides hope for others			0
’ bright eyes : eighteen - month - old @entity177 is seen here prior to surgery to correct his cleft palate massive change : @entity177 in the sunshine in the garden of @entity34 following the surgery transformation : eight month - old @entity185 pictured before and after surgery to correct his cleft lip and palate sheltering in a tented area from the baking sun with his mother , eight month - old @entity185 , who underwent an operation for a cleft lip , is one of those currently being helped by the @entity86 , set - up by the doctor ’s mother and friends to support projects dear to her heart			2
while the transformation in 13 year - old @entity202 ( open heart surgery ) and @entity82 ( deformity of the spine ) , has been so great that both were able to sit happily on swings in the walled garden of the project ’s headquarters tucked away off a crowded @entity1 street and the very real threat of the @entity39 ’s now regular brutal attacks on their targets in the capital			0
@entity5 has so far undergone three operations to correct her clubbed feet and doctors expect that within six months she will be able to walk freely without pain or difficulties – something her family believes will inspire others among what they call ‘ the forgotten , abandoned people ’ living in the harsh often desperate rural communities to seek help			2
easily treated : seven - month - old @entity229 pictured as she arrived at @entity34 , before undergoing surgery to correct her cleft palate some have travelled for days to reach the sanctuary that is @entity235 - one youngster undertook a journey that began with him being carried on a relative ’s back before he was placed in a wooden cart and then transferred to travel through the hills on the back of a donkey			0
bus and car saw him reach @entity1 after nearly four days			0
it is a journey he has now made three times but thanks to the medical teams here and their expertise to correct his twisted legs , he no longer needs to be carried by a relative			0
‘ @entity150 and @entity37 would have been pleased that the work done here has spread rapidly by word of mouth so that we are being approached for help from throughout @entity9 , ’ said ms @entity16 , who has worked in @entity9 over two decades as well as with other humanitarian crisis points such as @entity254 and @entity255 while overseeing a project backing schools for girls in the @entity258 , near the @entity260 mountain range , some 100 miles north of @entity1			1
‘ even in the most distant , remote border areas where there are no such things as telephones families are hearing of us and the fact that we provide both medical and after care thanks to the support we receive from the charities			0
‘ around 100 news cases a month are being helped with their lives changed forever for the better and much of it is thanks to the legacy of @entity150 and @entity37			2
’ new life : @entity229 with her mother in the garden of @entity34 after successful surgery to treat her miss @entity37 ’s parents @entity291 and @entity292 travelled to @entity1 earlier this year to witnesses how children were being helped and yesterday seven month - old @entity229 , recovering from surgery to a cleft lip and palate , and @entity301 , nine , whose twisted deformity of the legs has been corrected , were preparing with members of their families to leave after work paid for by the foundation			2
‘ the foundations have been able to help specific children – we see a lot of club feet , heart problems , curvature of the spine and cleft palate and lips – and their work makes a huge difference , ’ ms @entity16 said			0
‘ in days gone by these children would have died or if they had survived , their quality of life would have been very much compromised or they would have been outcasts			0
‘ it is very difficult for people in @entity17 to quite understand how remote these people are from the kind of health care which we see as part of our fabric of life			1
there is no such thing here , there is a lack of education , lack of health care and poverty ... so for children like these , unless we help and provide treatment , the future is not good ... it is very bleak			0
’ standing tall : nine - year - old @entity301 pictured at @entity34 before and after surgery to correct his twisted deformity of the legs that was paid for by the foundation set up in memory of miss @entity37 she added : ‘ the perception of @entity9 is that it is all bad news and that makes me crazy because in places like this ( @entity34 ) , there is so much good and positive news			1
’ @entity25 agreed : ‘ it is wonderful what has happened to @entity5 – she has had surgery three times – and is now happy that she can walk			0
she is looking forward so that one day she too can play and live like other girls			0
‘ to the people of the @entity91 i would say thank you for changing lives , for helping the children of @entity9 and thank you personally for helping my child			1
you have made me proud ’ a chance to smile : thanks to their treatments @entity82 and @entity5 now have hope of overcoming their disabilities they are heartfelt words that may provide some comfort and pride to the family of dr @entity103 – words echoed elsewhere across the @entity9 capital by those they are helping at @entity377 which provides vital equipment for orphanages , holds educational seminars for women and provides clothing , books and other much needed supplies to women ’s prisons donations to help those at @entity59 can be made by visiting the websites of the @entity86 , the @entity113 and the @entity389 .			1

foundations set up in memory of murdered @entity17 aid workers @entity41 and @entity37 are supporting the treatment of disabled youngsters
both women were killed in @entity9 in separate *incidents* in 2010 as they tried to give aid to the country 's most impoverished people
