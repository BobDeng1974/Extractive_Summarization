stage fright : but when @entity8 appeared on @entity10 's @entity9 on tuesday night , it seems being in front of a national audience got the better of her ' which of these is not a piece of jewellery commonly worn to symbolise a relationship between two people ? ' @entity17 asked @entity8			2
as four options were read out in front of her , @entity8 nodded and considered each possibility			0
with four options - engagement ring , anniversary ring , wedding ring and burger ring , which is a famous @entity38 brand of chips - it appeared quite easy to identify the correct answer through a swift process of elimination			1
but after hesitating and letting out a small giggle , @entity8 said ' uh ... ooh i think i 'm going to go with b on that one @entity17 , the anniversary ring '			0
not quite right : the blonde beauty who was the first of six contestants to sit down face - to - face with host @entity17 , ended up answering a rather obvious question wrong stunned : astounded himself by @entity8 's certainty , the show 's @entity17 asked the contestant to ' have another look ' at the options ' although burger ring 's an interesting one , ' she added			1
looking up at the host she looked quite confident with her answer , flashing a friendly smile for the cameras as all eyes were on her			1
astounded himself by @entity8 's certainty , @entity17 asked the contestant to ' have another look ' at the options			0

realisation : oblivious of why audience members were giggling in the background , @entity8 soon after realised her mistake when @entity17 repeated the question again amused : @entity17 could n't believe @entity8 got the rather obvious question wrong oblivious of why audience members were giggling in the background , @entity8 soon after realised her mistake when @entity17 repeated the question again			1
' @entity82 that 's the most embarrassing thing that 's ever happened to me , ' she finally exclaimed , with still a wide smile on her face and taking the loss in good spirits			0
' can we cut and start again ? ' she then pleaded with @entity17 , but he said ' that 's why it 's called the @entity9 ' and unfortunately the game was over for her			0
game over : while she then pleaded @entity17 to give her another chance , the host said @entity8 's time on the show was over			0
