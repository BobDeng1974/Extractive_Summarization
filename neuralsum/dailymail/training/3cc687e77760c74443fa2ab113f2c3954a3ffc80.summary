@entity4 , 25 , was devastated when she was humiliated in front of all of her friends and a bar full of strangers after the man threw a drink at her on the stairs of a bar in her hometown of @entity15			2
it was the turning point @entity17 needed to finally do something about her 22st 5lb frame			1

@entity17 , who is a local government authority officer , said : ' i was never a skinny girl , even when i was younger , but i was never fat either			2
i danced four times a week and was competing in championships on nearly a weekly basis			2
' i would always be nervous when i went on a night out , but the night it happened i had made the effort with my hair and make up , and worn a dress			1
i felt really confident which is why it came as such a blow			2
' he walked right up to me , turned round and said , ‘ look at the state of you			2
you ’re disgusting , ’ and threw his drink at me			2
although her father made healthy food at home , @entity17 would buy crisps and sweets with her own money and eat them in secret , causing her weight to balloon ' nobody should be made to feel the way that man made me feel , but it finally gave me the push i needed to do something about my weight			1
' if i met him now i ’d shake his hand because without him i never would have done anything about my size			1
' @entity17 started putting on weight when she stopped dancing aged 17			1
although her father made healthy food at home , she would buy crisps and sweets with her own money and eat them in secret			1
@entity17 said : ' i thought that if no one saw me doing it , then i had n’t done it , which is never a good way to be			2
the incident on her friends birthday forced @entity17 to look at the risks associated with her unhealthy lifestyle ' by the time i realised that my weight was going up , it was too late			1
by then i was a size 26			1
' @entity17 ’s diet was always put on the backburner until the turning point came while out for her friend ’s birthday			0
she says : ' i went to the toilets on my own and was going back down the stairs to find my friends as this young man was coming up			0
' luckily , my friend was coming up the stairs as it happened because i was furious			0
' but the incident forced @entity17 to look at the risks associated with her unhealthy lifestyle and she started researching diet plans and which one would be right for her			1
@entity17 says if she met the man who threw the drink now she would thank him she eventually decided on the @entity27 , which involved rebuilding her relationship with food by first cutting it out completely and replacing it with milkshakes and porridge			1
her incredible weight loss of 10st 7lb led to @entity17 being crowned @entity26 at the @entity27 awards			1
@entity17 said : ' i needed to know that i had set boundaries and would n’t be tempted by even just small amounts of unhealthy foods			1
' a lot of people doubted me when i first started and did n’t think i would be able to stick to the diet , but when they could see how well i was doing they became more encouraging			0
' proving people wrong has given me an extra boost of confidence and motivated me to carry on			0
' now my mum will tell anyone that will listen for long enough about how well i ’ve done			0
' there were times when i would think ‘ this is it , i ’ve done enough now ’ , but my mum and my boyfriend ’s mum spurred me on to keep going and keep losing the weight			1
' since losing the weight , @entity17 ’s confidence has skyrocketed and she has also met her boyfriend , @entity126			2
@entity17 said : i met @entity126 towards the end of my diet and we ’ve been together about seven months			0
' the relationship would n’t have worked before i do n’t think			0
i would have constantly been wondering why he was interested in me			0
' i would have been constantly thinking he ’s only with me until something better comes along			0
before i was with @entity126 i did n’t know what it was like to be with someone who was nice to me all the time			0
' @entity17 has also noticed more subtle changes in her day - to - day life , including in other people ’s behaviour towards her , especially as a young woman			0
@entity17 has been crowned @entity26 by the @entity27 due to her dieting success she says : ' people used to look at me and judge me			1
they were looking down on me because i was young and overweight			0
' now , people will hold a door open for me			0
it sounds silly but that was something that would n’t have happened before			0
' there are also things that people take for granted , like being able to cross my legs under my desk at work , sitting in an aeroplane seat comfortably and being able to walk between two cars in a car park without worrying you ’d get stuck			0
' seeing herself as a role model , @entity17 is now feeling the pressure to keep the weight off for good			1
' losing this much weight , going from a size 26 to a size 12 , is something people in their forties do , not people in their twenties			1
