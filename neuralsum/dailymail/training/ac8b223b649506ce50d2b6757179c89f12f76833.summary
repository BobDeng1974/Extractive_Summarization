@entity0 left @entity1 with a solitary point to show for their efforts in the @entity5 opener against a spirited @entity7 side			0
as @entity9 made his entry into full @entity12 competition the chances were slim for both sides , although @entity14 went close for the visitors early hitting the crossbar and @entity17 was tested more than his counterpart			1
@entity20 's @entity19 was there and rates the @entity0 players ' performances below			2
@entity0 striker @entity14 's shot hits the cross bar in one of the best chances to break the deadlock @entity0 @entity17 - 6.5 not the busiest of nights for the @entity30 stopper , who was otherwise reliable when called upon between the sticks			1
@entity33 - 6.0 much like @entity34 , @entity33 was limited to providing attacking width from full - back and struggled defensively			2
@entity37 - 6.5 misjudged a header in the first half that nearly resulted in @entity7 scoring , but helped marshall the defence well			0
@entity42 - 7.0 made a number of crucial blocks to cover team - mate errors			1
the @entity46 slowly looks like getting back to his best			0
@entity0 's @entity42 was a rare encouraging performer for his side @entity34 - 5.0 looked uncertain in possession , and was the target for many @entity7 attacks down the right side			1
@entity52 - 5.0 @entity53 in an attacking sense and was careless in giving the ball away			0
@entity56 looked like making a major impact			0
@entity58 - 6.5 calm and composed in possession and anchored the midfield well			0
replaced by @entity61 after picking up second half knock			0
@entity52 went missing in attack and did n't value possession when given the opportunity @entity66 - 5.5 @entity66 's strongest asset is his pace , but even on the rare occasions he could use it , the winger darted into dead ends			1
paulinho - 5.0 a passenger throughout the game			2
it was no surprise to see the @entity76 replaced by the attack minded @entity78 on the hour			1
@entity79 - 6.5 tried to be @entity0 's most creative player			2
but @entity0 never had a shot on target while he was on the pitch			0
@entity14 - 6.0 hit the woodwork in the opening moments , but never linked with team - mates in midfield and was easily marked out of the game			1
@entity14 came close hitting the woodwork but was shutdown too easily substitutes @entity78 5.0 ( for @entity94 ' ) brought on to help @entity14 in attack with 30 minutes left but hardly got a sniff of the action or anywhere near the @entity7 goal			1
@entity85 6.0 ( for @entity99 ' ) brought tricks and flicks to @entity0 's attack after coming on , but like @entity79 could n't help the visitors take control			0
@entity61 6.5 ( for @entity105 ' ) disciplined in midfield after replacing @entity58 , and brought a physical presence to help limit @entity7 's growing influence			0
striker @entity78 came on with half an hour to go to add spice to @entity0 attack and chase a goal			1

@entity14 hit the crossbar in one of the 0 - 0 draw 's rare chances
@entity9 made his debut in full @entity12 competition
@entity42 impressed with a number of crucial blocks
@entity94 was a passenger and replaced on the hour by @entity78
