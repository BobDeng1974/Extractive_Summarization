by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 4 march 2013 protesters today held a demonstration against the controversial natural gas extraction process called fracking - on a village green opposite the chancellor 's constituency office			1
the process of fracking , which extracts shale gas deposits from beneath the earth , has been proposed at numerous sites across the @entity13 countryside			1
chancellor @entity14 is one of the main supporters of shale gas energy - which has been proposed in his own @entity19 constituency in @entity20			1
@entity22 campaigners today spent several hours operating a ' fake fracking ' work site in @entity19 's main town of @entity25 in protest against the plans before closing it down this afternoon			1
on the chancellor 's doorstep : @entity22 set up a fake ' fracking ' operation on a green opposite @entity14 's constituency office in @entity25 , @entity19 the controversial technique of fracking uses a high - pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock campaign : @entity14 's @entity19 constituency is one of many sites around the @entity13 that has been earmarked for shale gas extraction the campaigners also took over a local @entity48 club and unveiled a huge banner down the side of the building			1
the front page of @entity22 ’s website was dedicated to the anti-fracking protest for the day , with a live webcam and statements supporting their cause			2
a statement on the site said : ' fracking is a dangerous gamble that will threaten local environments , derail efforts to tackle climate change and cost green jobs and investment			2
controversial : chancellor @entity14 is a enthusiastic supporter of developing shale gas energy in @entity13 ' across the street from his office is a beautiful village green where teams of activists have constructed a huge fake fracking operation - to show the chancellor what his gas nightmare will look like			1
' chief inspector @entity76 of @entity77 said : ' police attended a peaceful protest at @entity14 's constituency office in @entity81 in @entity25			1
' in total approximately 25 people from @entity22 were at the location			2
' most of the protesters left by 2.30pm			0
there were no issues , no one was arrested , and there was no impact on the traffic in the area			0
' there was a police presence as the role of the constabulary is to impartially allow for peaceful protesting , whilst ensuring that others can continue unhindered in their legitimate business activities , or commuting			0
' the controversial technique to extract shale gas - known as fracking - uses a high - pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock			1
campaigners claim drilling could scar the @entity13 countryside , pollute water supplies , and clog roads with hundreds of lorries transporting gas and dirty water			1
in the @entity117 , fracking has led to local contamination of water with methane and the extraordinary spectacle of people being able to set fire to the water coming out of their taps because of the gas content			2
organised : @entity22 created a fictional company called @entity129 for the demonstration against fracking the @entity22 campaigners took over the local @entity48 club as @entity129 's base for the protest climate concerns : campaigners claim drilling for shale gas will scar the @entity13 countryside and cause pollution @entity22 environmental campaigner @entity140 said : ' fracking is an unnecessary practice			1
we do n't need fracking , we do n't need shale gas when we have got low - carbon forms of energy which not only deliver but also help the economy by delivering growth			1
' the process of fracking involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals deep underground to force out natural gas from the surrounding layers of shale rock			1
engineers have known about shale gas for more than a century			1
in 1875 , @entity162 geologists sank a borehole in @entity164 to investigate shale , a finely grained rock - created from compressed mud - which sits in layers			0
when a flame was lowered into the hole , it exploded , confirming the presence of natural gas			0
but getting this gas out of the ground is extremely complicated			0
below the @entity180 , natural gas forms in sandstone and when a drill reaches the gas , it flows out			0
but shale gas is locked in dense rock			2
energy companies must drill a well hundreds or thousands of feet deep to reach the layer of shale – which can be just 50 feet thick - and then turn the drill sideways to bore horizontally			2
water , chemicals and sand are pumped into the hole under enormous pressure until the rock cracks , allowing gas locked up in the shale to escape and flow upwards into the well			2
this process is called hydraulic fracturing - fracking for short			0
@entity198 is believed to be sitting on one of the biggest shale gas fields in the world – with a reserve of 200 trillion cubic feet lying under the @entity204 countryside			1
it ’s enough gas to keep the @entity13 going for 50 years , end reliance on imported gas from @entity209 and create more than 5,000 jobs			2
it is ten times more than all the natural gas known to be left under the @entity180 , and a fifth of the size of the world ’s biggest field			0
in the @entity117 , where fracking has been carried out for more than a decade , the process has halved the price of natural gas			0
but opinion is still widely divided on shale gas			2
supporters believe it could solve the growing global energy crisis while opponents of fracking continue to argue that it is a dangerous process which should be abandoned			2
environmentalists insist the technique releases toxins and methane gas into nearby water supplies - which has already occurred in @entity117 - and scupper any chances of cutting greenhouse gases			0
and after fracking caused an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.3 in @entity240 last april , there are concerns about the scale of the earthquakes it can trigger			0
fracking has already been banned in @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 as well as in @entity249 and parts of @entity251			0
today 's protest came with the release of a @entity255 poll , conducted on behalf of @entity22 , which found that 12 per cent of residents in @entity19 who voted @entity48 in the last election would be less likely to vote @entity48 again if fracking went ahead in the area			1
' it seems @entity14 is so wedded to his dash for gas that he 's willing to ignore the views of his own constituents , ' mr @entity140 said			0
' it 's time the chancellor stopped trying to play the @entity267 of @entity20 and concentrated on investment in clean , safe , renewable technology that will create longer term jobs and a more stable economy			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity77 said : ' @entity77 have been made aware of an incident at the @entity274 in @entity81 in @entity25			0
' officers are in attendance			0
' nearly two - thirds of the country could be sitting on shale gas reserves - although estimates of how much is actually below @entity13 vary wildly			1
industry experts believe there may be up to four times more than the previously estimates of 300 trillion cubic feet - enough to supply @entity13 for many decades			0
in the next few weeks , an official report by the @entity285 is set to be released and expected to announce deposits are far larger than previously predicted			0
the chancellor hopes the @entity13 's energy landscape can be transformed by shale gas and help prevent the oncoming crisis - like in the @entity117 , where drilling has helped drive down prices			1
in a bid to promote investment in shale gas , the chancellor is set to offer lucrative tax breaks and a simplified regulatory regime to the industry			1
and he has the support of @entity299 , who has also backed the technology and said @entity13 should be at the heart of the shale ' gas revolution ' , claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills			1
@entity308 energy secretary @entity307 has sounded a much more cautious note than his conservative coalition counterparts , warning shale gas is ' unlikely ' to reduce bills and is ' no silver bullet '			1
however , other energy experts say flooding the market with cheap gas will set back the @entity13 ’s move to green energy			1
@entity318 of the @entity319 said : ‘ the world is heading for a rise in temperature if energy use continues as it does now			0
' but if we switch to shale gas , then there ’ll still be a rise			2
we already burn too many fossil fuels , it wo n’t make enough of a difference			0
’ and analysis by the @entity333 data undertaken by @entity22 shows the majority of licences are held by companies with a foreign firm as their only or largest investor			0
@entity22 energy campaigner @entity140 said : ' the government has earmarked nearly two thirds of @entity342 for potential fracking , despite everyone from @entity345 to the energy secretary to energy regulator @entity347 saying that @entity13 shale gas wo n't bring down bills			1
' now we find that over half of the drilling rights in the @entity13 are held by companies that are significantly made up of foreign interests , including the @entity354 government			0
' we already know the chancellor is offering them generous tax breaks , so you have to ask yourself how consumers and the wider economy will benefit , let alone the climate			0
