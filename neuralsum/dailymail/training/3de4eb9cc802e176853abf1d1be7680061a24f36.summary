@entity0 knew something definitely was n’t right when a lingering sense of fatigue saw him trudge off the @entity5 turf last january and make his way down the tunnel in a daze			1
despite his tender years , he had been feeling the pace in recent games for @entity13 ’s side - but had never felt as shattered as this			1
@entity15 did the talented teenager realise that he was experiencing something far more serious than mere exhaustion following his exertions on the park			1
recovery : @entity22 midfielder @entity0 is continuing to make his comeback from a viral infection not even in his worst nightmares could @entity0 have anticipated that he would miss the rest of the season or - more frighteningly - be told that his substitution just before the hour mark during that 3 - 2 league win over @entity31 might be his last - ever appearance on a football field			1
yet that was the frightening reality facing the young @entity22 midfielder when tests revealed that his excessive tiredness had been caused by a viral infection attacking the muscles around his heart			1
an awful six - month spell in limbo ensued during which time @entity0 feared that his career in the game might be over			1
that he has now come through his health scare - and has finally been given the all - clear from the virus by medics after a period of rest and recuperation - has given the youngster what feels like a second lease of life			1
he duly marked his comeback earlier this month with a spectacular goal in a 4 - 2 victory over @entity59 behind closed doors at @entity61			1
since then he has put in impressive performances on @entity22 ’ tour of @entity64 against @entity65 and , in particular , during saturday night ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity67			1
speaking for the first time about his ordeal on monday , @entity0 , now 20 , revealed how the potential enormity of his situation only really hit home when a cousin asked him if he had made alternative career plans			1
career - threatening : @entity0 was worried that he may never be able to kick a football again however , now that he is back in @entity13 ’s first - team plans , he has declared himself fit and ready to help the @entity5 club return to the @entity79 top flight			1
‘ a couple of months into last season i remember feeling tired , but i just put that down to the fact that i was playing regularly for the first team , ’ recalled @entity80			2
‘ i did n’t think too much about it but then i started getting more and more tired			2
‘ in the couple of weeks before i finally stopped playing , i was getting so knackered in matches that i sat back and knew that something might be wrong			1
‘ it was frustrating for me because i was n’t playing as well as i could and i was wondering what was wrong			2
‘ in that game when i came off ( the @entity93 match against @entity31 ) i felt faint and dizzy			2
‘ i had tests done afterwards and the results were low			2
then a second test showed that i was n’t getting any better – and that underlined it for me			2
‘ it was kind of a frightening time for me but i did well to try and put it to the back of my mind , ’ added @entity80			2
‘ the doctors could n’t tell me what was happening , they could n’t assure me that i would be back in six months or whatever			2
‘ so it was really just a waiting game to see how the results came back			2
‘ but a lot of people , even the doctor himself , admitted to me that it could have been the end ( of my career )			1
back in the action : @entity0 is now fully recovered after a period of rest and recuperation ‘ i did n’t really think about it			1
but then my cousin asked me how i would feel if the results did n’t go according to plan and what i would do			2
i kind of thought about it then and it was quite scary			2
‘ but then the results came back after that and they were good and i could n’t have felt any happier			0
‘ it was a viral infection that had affected my organs and it was scary – but i ’ m back to normal now and hopefully it ’s all behind me			1
’ even in his darkest days , @entity0 never allowed himself to think about a career without football			1
but he admits that his recovery and return to the first team feels as if he has been given a second chance in the game			1
‘ in a way , it makes me appreciate things more , thinking that i might not have been able to play any more , ’ said the youngster , who has made 39 appearances for the club , scoring eight goals in the process			0
‘ that makes you think about it and makes you realise what you have here			0
‘ and that you have to grab it with both hands			0
in a way that ’s been good for me , because it has made me push on			0
‘ but i never really allowed myself to wonder what i would do if i was n’t able to play football			0
‘ i did n’t want to think about that			0
i did n’t want to put in my head what i would do if i could n’t play again			0
far flung : rangers are currently on a pre-season tour of @entity164 and are in @entity165 right now ‘ but luckily enough that ’s not an issue now			0
‘ it ’s so good to be back playing again			0
it ’s a huge weight off my shoulders knowing that i am back and kicking a ball around again			0
‘ so far everything is looking good for me after six months out			0
‘ i owe a lot to my pals , my family , the manager , coaches and team - mates for their support			0
and i especially owe the doc and physio because they took a lot of time – their own time as well – keeping me sane and keeping me going			0
’ for @entity80 , the aim is now to help @entity22 complete their journey back to the top of @entity79 football after the club ’s descent to the bottom tier			1
but the @entity79 under - 21 international knows they will have to be at their best to pip @entity192 and @entity193 to the @entity195 crown ths coming season			0
‘ i ’ve always said i wanted to play for @entity22 at the top level			1
and , hopefully , all going well i can get through this season with no injuries or silly things and then i can look forward to playing in the @entity201			0
‘ i am feeling good and i am now back to full pelt			0
‘ of course , i ’ve been out for six months so i ’m going to be tired but it ’s not like how i felt back then when the problem first arose			0
‘ i feel good and i just want to work on my fitness and get more games in , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s going to be a lot of interest in the championship this season because there are a few good teams in that league			0
‘ it ’s probably more difficult and competitive than the @entity201			0
but we ’re all looking forward to the challenge at @entity22 and hopefully we can finish top			1
