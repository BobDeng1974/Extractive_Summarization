@entity1 is yet to come up with a way to pay for its plans to cut tuition fees by £ 3,000 a year , it emerged last night			1
@entity5 is expected to launch the policy during the election campaign in an effort to woo former @entity10 voters and students			1
but shadow chancellor @entity12 has not yet worked out how to fund the reduction of a third , which is expected to cost £ 2.5billion a year			2
previously , @entity1 said if it were currently in power , it would pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks and higher rates of interest for better - off students			1
but this is yet to be firmed up as a manifesto commitment			0
a student challenged mr @entity5 on the subject of fees in @entity35 three weeks ago			2
the @entity1 leader answered that he would be making an offer but told voters to ‘ watch this space ’ for the details			0
he promised the plan would be ‘ credible and costed ’ to avoid a repeat of @entity46 ’s disastrous u-turn on the matter , after the @entity42 raised fees to a maximum of £ 9,000 from 2012			2
u-turn : mr @entity46 ’s failure to stick to his 2010 election vow not to increase fees is widely seen as @entity51 of his political career mr @entity46 ’s failure to stick to his 2010 election promise not to increase fees is widely seen as a crucial reason for huge disaffection among @entity10 voters			1
the @entity58 ’s economics editor @entity57 reported on his blog last night that mr @entity5 wants to announce the fees cut next month			1
but he added that mr @entity12 has been ‘ asked to make the sums add up ’			0
a @entity62 source said the commitment to lower the cost of university tuition would ‘ lead to higher taxes or borrowing ’			0
the source also pointed out mr @entity5 would , by cutting fees , be reversing a pledge made during his @entity1 leadership campaign to introduce a graduate tax			1
this would involve graduates paying more tax over a lifetime as a result of having a degree			0
however last week , the party ’s universities spokesman @entity78 indicated that @entity1 could still move to a graduate tax in the long term			2
cutting fees would be popular among students at a time when @entity1 is facing fierce competition for their votes from the @entity88 , which wants to scrap fees altogether			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ in trebling tuition fees this government has found a system of university finance that puts a huge burden of debt on students , while almost costing the taxpayer more than it saves			1
it lets down both the next generation and the public finances			0
’ @entity1 introduced tuition fees in september 1998 , with students expected to pay up to £ 1,000 a year			1
the fees were then increased to £ 3,000 a year during @entity1 ’s second term in january 2004 .			0

@entity5 expected to launch the policy during the election campaign
party had said the cut would be funded by corporation tax increase
@entity46 *'s* failure to *honour* his tuition fees promise left him *discredited*
