@entity1 superb fortitude paid off when the long - suffering @entity2 pipped @entity3 to capture his maiden @entity5 title at the @entity6			1
@entity1 had gone from the heady heights of being a @entity9 player in the top 50 in the world in 2008 to a lowly 792nd as his career nosedived and he was forced to seek salvation on the @entity13			1
so bad was his plight the 34 - year - old from @entity16 even feared he might be forced to find another job			1
@entity18 1 @entity3 takes a break as he waits to play the 17th , where he made a terrible error @entity3 dropped two shots at the first and ended up missing out on the title by a single shot lowly ranked @entity2 @entity1 won the tournament , his first with a prize of over £ 500,000 but @entity1 ’s world changed forever on the @entity29 at @entity30 when he claimed a one - shot victory over world @entity32 , scot @entity34 and fellow @entity2 @entity35			1
@entity36 missed a birdie on the last to force a play - off , while @entity34 was two clear of the field after his eighth birdie of the day on the 15th , only to bogey the 16th and 17th in a closing 67			2
@entity3 ’s chances ended when he putted into the @entity44 bunker on the 17th			1
but @entity1 , who had held the lead going into the final day , kept calm and a closing 70 earned him a life - changing £ 489,416			1
‘ to win at @entity30 is a dream come true , ’ said @entity1 , who had finished second a record nine times on the @entity13			1
‘ it ’s hard to believe after dreaming of this moment so many times			2
‘ after waking up at three o’clock this morning , i let my mind wander for the next five hours thinking all sorts			2
@entity35 reacts after his putt at the 18th slips agonizingly past the hole to give @entity1 the win @entity36 congratulates @entity1 after the @entity2 won his first big tournament @entity36 had played well all week but could n't force a play - off on the eighteenth at @entity30 ‘ never having won a tournament , my mind kept going back to how i was going to play and i won three times in my sleep			1
‘ in the middle of last year , playing @entity13 , shooting 80s , not even being close to making the cut , was pretty low			2
that was hard to take and i was starting to think : “ what am i going to do ? ” ‘ it ’s expensive to play golf and two grand a week goes fast if you ’re not making anything			2
‘ but i just tried to put it out of my mind			0
i kept working hard and now it has all been worthwhile			0
‘ i do n’t have to go back to qualifying school and i ca n’t tell you how pleased i am about that ! ’ @entity1 ’s wife , @entity80 , surprised him when she arrived unannounced to lend her support and , after spotting her as he walked up the 18th , he added : ‘ that was very special			1
’ the @entity83 could not believe it when he won the title after @entity35 failed to sink his putt @entity1 holds his head in his hands after the biggest win of his career at the @entity6 so , too , were the words of encouragement from @entity3 when the four - time major winner walked up to him on the 10th and wished him good luck			1
@entity1 said : ‘ i ’ve always got on well with @entity3 but now i have even more respect for him			1
‘ he told me to stick in there , keep playing great and try to win the tournament			2
this was from a guy who himself was looking to win			0
so , not only is he a world - class golfer , he ’s a world - class person			0
’ two mistakes , a double - bogey six at the first and a dropped shot at the penultimate hole , saw @entity3 finish runner - up in the event for a third time since his debut seven years ago			1
@entity1 kisses his wife @entity80 on the 18th green after winnning the championship and beginning to celebrate @entity1 gets right down on the floor to take a look at a putt on his way to the excellent win he said : ‘ i cost myself the tournament in the space of about 20 yards at the front of the green at the first and at the @entity44 bunker			1
they were the only two mistakes i made all day			0
‘ but i love this golf course			0
i feel like i play well every time i tee it up and i ’m looking forward to coming back next year to defend the @entity127			0
‘ i ’m ready for a break			0
i ’m not 100 per cent but it ’s easy to accept these things when you have two majors in the bag and you have played so well with a couple of trophies on your mantelpiece			0
‘ i ’ve found some sort of calmness on the course or inner peace , whatever you want to call it			0
’ @entity1 , ranked 792 in the world , played one of the shots of his life on sunday to help with the tournament @entity3 missed out after two major errors but said he was enjoying playing the @entity29 at @entity30 the only downside for @entity3 was his failure to give dad and playing partner @entity151 a 55th birthday to remember by winning the team event			1
@entity154 just missed out on a third @entity5 title after losing three months of the season to an ankle injury			0
‘ i ’m proud of the way i stuck in , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n’t get it done but i gave it 100 per cent the whole week and played to win			0
‘ it ’s good i can play the way i did in a field that is strong on a course that does n’t always suit me , more the bombers			0
‘ i just need to find that extra inch which will pull me over the line in a big tournament and i do n’t think it ’s far away			2
