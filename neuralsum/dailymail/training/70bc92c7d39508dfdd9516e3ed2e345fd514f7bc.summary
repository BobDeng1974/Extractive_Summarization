@entity8 purposely careered off a bend on a quiet country road in order to kill his 47 - year - old wife in a ‘ most cunning way ’ , it was claimed			1
despite being ‘ fanatical ’ about wearing a seatbelt , @entity14 was not strapped in , jurors were told yesterday			2
her husband , however , was wearing his seatbelt			2
' cunning ' : a court sketch shows @entity8 in the dock at @entity21 where he stands accused of murdering his wife @entity22 , right , by deliberately crashing his car into a tree as she rode in the passenger seat mrs @entity14 , the managing director of a business that specialised in cleaning up chemical spills , was said to have been terrified of her husband in the months before her death , even telling one friend : ‘ one day he will kill me			1
’ @entity21 @entity21 heard that she would never have got into his car unless forced or tricked			2
prosecutor @entity31 said @entity8 , who ran a car trailer business , had been unable to accept that his wife wanted a divorce and had started a new relationship			1
he killed her , the barrister said , ‘ out of greed , anger and possibly jealousy ’			0
miss @entity40 told the jury : ‘ the car was driven into a tree and the deceased died almost instantaneously because the airbag did n’t detonate – and the reason the airbag did n’t detonate was because it had been switched off			1
‘ the question for you is , “ who switched the airbag off ? ” his airbag was on , hers off			2
he was wearing his seatbelt , she was n’t			0
@entity53 in the brace position , her dead			0
' she was fearful he might do something to her , and that is exactly what he did , in the most cunning way , in a plan that was not likely , he thought , to raise suspicion			0
’ the couple had a ten - year - old son , who was away on a school trip at the time of the crash			0
@entity65 near @entity21 , where mrs @entity66 died : an examination of her husband 's car 's data recording system found that ' someone ' had turned the passenger side airbag off ' six cycles ' before the crash mrs @entity14 , who also had two adult daughters from a previous marriage , suffered no injuries consistent with wearing a belt			1
@entity80 claims she was either not wearing one , or did not have it clipped in			0
miss @entity40 told jurors : ‘ if she was n’t wearing a seatbelt , you have to ask yourself who unclipped it			0
’ she said accident investigators found no evidence that @entity8 , 53 , had attempted an emergency stop , and that the passenger side of his @entity91 received the ‘ brunt ’ of the collision			1
he escaped the crash with minor injuries – and bruising consistent with being in the ‘ brace ’ position at the time he crashed into the tree at an estimated 52.3mph			0
a police officer who examined the scene concluded that the vehicle had partly negotiated a bend and then taken a ‘ different and deliberate ’ course that led to the tree			0
miss @entity40 said it was a mystery what mrs @entity14 was doing in her husband ’s car			2
she had her own @entity111 and would ‘ never willingly ’ travel in his vehicle			0
when police examined the @entity111 , which was at the estranged couple ’s home in @entity119 , near @entity21 , last october , they found it contained mrs @entity14 ’s purse , phone , laptop and overnight bag			1

splitting the assets : the @entity127 ' £ 300,000 family home in @entity119 , which the couple still shared			1
the court heard they had an ' acrimonious ' discussion about the division of their assets the day before the crash mr @entity8 's @entity91 : the ' brunt ' of the damage , pictured here before the collision , was received by the passenger side , and there was no evidence the suspect had attempted an emergency stop , the court heard mrs @entity14 suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash near their home village			1
the prosecutor added that @entity8 claimed to have no recollection of the crash but a number of witnesses at the scene believed he was ‘ faking ’ unconsciousness			2
miss @entity40 said ‘ matters had been brought to a head ’ a day before the crash when mrs @entity14 had an ‘ acrimonious ’ discussion with her husband about the division of assets , particularly the £ 300,000 home they still shared despite living ‘ separate lives ’			1
in text messages to one of her daughters that night , she said the conversation had gone badly because @entity8 wanted ‘ more than half ’ of the house , and that she planned to lock herself in her bedroom because she was so scared of him			2
miss @entity40 said @entity8 had previously told his wife in a ‘ menacing ’ way : ‘ you ’ll get your feelings back for me			1
’ she also told a work colleague her husband ‘ had evil in his eyes ’ when they spoke , and that she feared being alone with him			1
the couple had married in 2000 , but the marriage ran into difficulties and mrs @entity14 began divorce proceedings last year			0
the decree absolute was issued the month following her death			0
