by @entity0 the story of the ferocious but lovable great aunt upon whom the character of @entity4 was based is to be told in print for the first time			1
@entity7 , known as @entity8 , was credited with being the inspiration for the magical nanny created by her niece , @entity4 author @entity12			1
described by @entity12 as a ' bulldog with a ferocious exterior ' but with a ' heart tender to the point of sentimentality ' , she was a strong , no - nonsense presence in her niece 's life , as well as her work			1
until now , little has been known about the woman who inspired the world 's best - loved nanny , but a publisher with a nose for a story has discovered a barely - known short story about the author 's great aunt			1
much loved story : @entity4 , played in the 1964 film by @entity33 , had real - life inspiration @entity12 , who based @entity4 on her irascible but lovable @entity8 , wrote a short story about her @entity38 's @entity37 was hunting for any unpublished work by @entity12 when she came across a short , semi-autobiographical story , entitled @entity8 , that @entity12 had written in 1941 about her aunt , whose real name was @entity43			1
ms @entity37 said : ' i read it but i was n't expecting much			2
i thought it might be too personal , or just not very good , but it completely blew me away			0
' i laughed , i cried - it was moving , funny , tender , and a really , really lovely story			0
' in the book , @entity12 described the fierce great aunt with a heart of gold tenderly , saying : ' her remarkableness lay in the extraordinary and , to me , enchanting discrepancy between her external behaviour and her inner self			1
' it tells how the author heard about her great aunt 's death , saying : ' i thought to myself " some day , in spite of her , i shall commit the ' disrespectful vulgarity ' of putting @entity8 in a book "			1
' and then it occurred to me that this had already been done , though unconsciously and without intent			0
' we write more than we know we are writing			0
we do not guess at the roots that made our fruit			0
i suddenly realised that there is a book through which @entity8 , stern and tender , secret and proud , anonymous and loving , stalks with her silent feet			0
' you will find her occasionally in the page of @entity4			0
' @entity4 : it took @entity78 14 years ( and a lot of money ) to persuade @entity12 to sell him the film rights all smiles : @entity12 , right , was so upset with @entity78 when the film came out ( she is pictured with him and @entity33 ) she stopped him making a sequel and remained cross with him until her death @entity33 and @entity12 became friends , but the author said the actress was ' directed wrongly ' in the film after writing the 35 - page book during @entity93 , @entity12 printed off a few copies and gave them to family and friends for @entity96 , but it has never reached a wider audience , til now			1
@entity99 now intends to publish the story , along with two others that the author had only ever given to friends , in one edition this november , in time for @entity96			1
the other stories , which are of similar lengths , are called @entity105 and @entity106 , and both tell the tales of real - life unlikely heroes who meant a great deal to the young @entity12 as she grew up in her native @entity112			1
ms @entity37 said : ' @entity105 is a @entity113 cook who chants threats at crying babies - very melodically - to make them sleep , while @entity106 is a heart - breaking but foul - mouthed jockey with a filthy temper			1
' the trio the stories are based on played important parts in @entity12 ' life growing up on a sugar plantation in @entity125 near the @entity126			2
children 's classic : @entity12 based the character of @entity4 on her much - loved but ferocious @entity8 born @entity12 in 1899 , she suffered an impoverished childhood , which inspired her magical stories and characters			1
her father was a banker who turned to alcohol , lost all his money and died young - it is widely considered that the character in the @entity4 books , mr @entity138 , was based on him			2
as a young woman she was an actress , dancer and a poet before concentrating on fiction			0
ten years after leaving @entity112 for @entity144 , with very little money , @entity12 ' first @entity4 book was published in 1934 to great acclaim			2
@entity78 asked to turn her story into a film , under pressure from his daughters , who loved @entity4 , but @entity12 initially refused			2
@entity78 persisted , with letters , telegrams , visits and offers of money , and eventually , after 14 years of bombardment , the author agreed to sell him the film rights for $ 2million			0
the resulting film , starring @entity33 and @entity160 , was a smash hit when it was released in 1964 , but @entity12 did n't agree			0
she sobbed through it when she first saw it , horrified at the sentimentality of the acid - tongued nanny she 'd created , @entity33 ' prettiness which she thought did n't suit her character , and the animated scenes			0
@entity12 refused ever to work with @entity78 again , preventing them from making a much - wanted sequel , and when she died in 1996 , aged 96 , she was still upset about it			0
two years ago the film saving mr @entity138 was released , telling the story of @entity12 ' dramatic life and her feud with @entity78			2
her great aunt features in the minor role of ' @entity179 ' in the film , played by @entity181 , mostly in flashbacks .			0

@entity4 author @entity12 based nanny on her real - life great aunt
@entity7 , or ' @entity8 ' , was a *formidable* influence on her niece
@entity12 wrote a short story about her in 1941 but only gave it to her friends
story remained *unknown* until @entity38 editor @entity37 discovered it
she *'ll* publish it at @entity96 with two more : @entity105 and @entity106
ms @entity37 said : ' they offer an *insight* into the inspiration for @entity4 '
