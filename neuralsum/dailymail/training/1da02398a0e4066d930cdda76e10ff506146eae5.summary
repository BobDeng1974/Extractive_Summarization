by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 02:47 est , 20 december 2012 eating meals together as a family - even just once a week - boosts children ’s fruit and veg intake to near the recommended five - a - day , a study has found			1
researchers from the @entity8 found that even just sunday lunch round the table can help improve the diets			1
the survey of 2,389 children attending 52 primary schools in @entity15 discovered nearly two - thirds of children ( 63 per cent ) did not consume the @entity18 recommended amount of five portions ( 400g ) of fruit and veg a day			1
researchers at the @entity8 found children who eat meals with their families were much more likely to get their five - a - day children who always ate a family meal together at a table consumed 125g ( 1.5 portions ) more fruit and veg on average than children who never ate with their families			1
even those who reported eating together only once or twice a week consumed 95g ( 1.2 portions ) more than those who never ate together			0
the research also suggests parents who eat fruit and veg themselves and cut up such food for them also boosted how much their youngsters ’ ate			1
study supervisor professor @entity40 , of the @entity8 ’s @entity41 and @entity42 , said : ' even if it ’s just one family meal a week , when children eat together with parents or older siblings they learn about eating			2
' watching the way their parents or siblings eat and the different types of food they eat is pivotal in creating their own food habits and preferences			0
' in families where parents reported eating fruit and veg every day , children had on average one portion ( 80g ) more than children whose parents never or rarely ate fruit and veg			2
@entity65 , who conducted the study as part of her phd , said : ' modern life often prevents the whole family from sitting round the dinner table , but this research shows that even just sunday lunch round the table can help improve the diets of our families			1
' children whose parents always or sometimes cut up fruit and veg for them ate , on average , half a portion ( 40g ) and quarter of a portion more , respectively , than children of parents who never cut up their fruit and veg			2
the study found two - thirds of primary school children in @entity15 were not eating the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables prof @entity93 added : ' there are more benefits to having a family meal together than just the family ’s health			1
' they provide conversational time for families , incentives to plan a meal , and an ideal environment for parents to model good manners and behaviour			0
' it is estimated that one in 10 @entity110 children aged two to 10 is obese			0
dr @entity111 added : ' since dietary habits are established in childhood , the importance of promoting the family meal needs to be more prominent in public health campaigns			0
' future work could be aimed at improving parental intake or encouraging parents to cut up or buy snack - sized fruit and vegetables			2
' the study includes dietary measurements from 2,389 children attending 52 primary schools from the boroughs of @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 in @entity15			1
