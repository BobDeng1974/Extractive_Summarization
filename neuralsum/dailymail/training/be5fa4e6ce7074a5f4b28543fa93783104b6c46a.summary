everyone knows to hold off going to the bathroom for as long as possible after a few drinks because once that seal is broken the urge to take a trip to the toilet then regularly interrupts your evening			0
however , no one seems to question why our bladders fills up so quickly - particularly when consuming booze is so dehydrating			0
dr @entity12 has decided to explain the science behind why ' breaking the seal ' is inevitable when you get stuck into a few tipples - and he also dispels the myth that balancing loads of water with alcohol will make you less dehydrated			1
breaking the seal : the brain produces anti-diuretic hormone , @entity23 , to stop you from urinating - however when drinking alcohol your brain does n't make as much @entity23 as is ideally needed dr @entity12 explains why we need the toilet more often when we drink alcohol dr @entity12 says there is no ' magical ' seal that holds the urine at bay inside the bladder other than the ' normal urinary sphincter '			1
in fact , it is the alcohol that interferes with the amount of hydration required for the body to produce as the the brain and kidneys work together on a ' minute - by - minute basis ' to keep the bodily fluids flowing			2
the brain produces anti-diuretic hormone , @entity23 , to stop you from urinating - however when drinking alcohol your brain does n't make as much @entity23 as is ideally needed			1
he said the body holds up well until the third drink			2
it 's at about this point when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine - hence the endless toilet stops as the elbow continues to bend throughout the hours			1
dr @entity12 was then quick to point out that dehydration should not be taken lightly			2
' dehydration is quite serious â€” you can die of it , ' he warns in his regular @entity63 science column			0
he then compares the bladder to a dried - out sponge that you drip water onto until it eventually becomes drenched			0
' add just one more drop of water on top of the sponge and now a single drop of water will form on the bottom of the sponge and begin to form a continuous trickle , ' he said			0
this is when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine - hence the endless toilet stops as the elbow continues to bend throughout the hours and as logic has it - volume is also a factor as a social outing often involves consuming more alcohol than water			1
' of course , by the time you get up to a litre of beer you 're getting a little bit dehydrated and your kidneys will cut back a little , ' he said			0
' but overall the volume of urine you generate is still greater than the volume of water contained in the beer , so you get slightly dehydrated			2
' dr @entity12 is the first to admit it 's ' weird ' that although your body is dehydrated - it produces more fluid when consuming alcohol than if you were drinking water			1
' but , because you are voluntarily taking a powerful drug called alcohol , your protective systems get out of whack , ' he explains			0
and he quashes the theory that if you have lots of water in combination with alcohol you wo n't be as dehydrated because the body will only absorb about 30 - 50 per cent of the excess water			2
' the rest just goes down the toilet bowl			0
you end up better off than not having drunk the extra water , but you 'll still be dehydrated			0
' dr @entity12 's final words of wisdom about consuming copious amounts of booze ? ' you do n't buy beer , you only rent it			1
' drinking lots of water in combination with alcohol wo n't help you be less dehydrated because the body will only absorb about 30 - 50 per cent of the excess water			1

when drinking alcohol your bladder holds up well until the third drink
brain produces anti-diuretic hormone , @entity23 , to stop you from urinating
but when drinking alcohol your brain does n't make much @entity23
so this is when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine
volume also factors as social events often involve more alcohol than water
though getting dehydrated you urinate more as body is ' out of whack '
dr @entity12 dispels myth that balancing loads of water with alcohol will make you less dehydrated
