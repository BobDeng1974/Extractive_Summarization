by @entity0 a healthy seven - year - old girl died suddenly just hours after developing chickenpox			1
@entity4 's heartbroken parents are now warning others to be aware of the danger of the common illness			1
@entity4 's lifeless body was found by her distraught father @entity9 , 29 , just 24 hours after she broke out in spots on december 27 last year			1
@entity4 , seven , died after developing chickenpox			1
it is thought the illness might have triggered a fit an inquest heard he had checked on his daughter several times during the night but found her unresponsive and not breathing in her bed at about 3am			1
she was rushed from her home in @entity20 , @entity21 , to @entity21 @entity22 by ambulance where she tragically died			1
@entity24 heard yesterday how her death may have been triggered by a fit brought on by the chickenpox			1
but @entity21 deputy coroner @entity28 concluded @entity4 died of unknown natural causes			1
a pathologist was unable to provide an exact cause of death			2
after the hearing , mr @entity33 and his partner , @entity34 , 29 , spoke of their loss and told how they wanted to raise awareness of the complications that can be caused by the virus			0
a coroner recorded a verdict of death by unknown natural causes mr @entity33 said : ‘ we need more awareness that chickenpox is not just a harmless childhood illness			1
‘ i had no idea it could cause the shut - down of organs , i thought the worst thing was it 'll scar if you scratch them			0
‘ i just ca n’t comprehend how my daughter could have died of something that doctors describe as a simple illness			2
‘ @entity4 had been suffering quite badly and over the night , i kept hearing heavy breathing on the monitor and checking she was okay			1
‘ she seemed to be just sleeping , but on the last time i came back to check i found she was n't breathing			2
we did what we could			0
‘ we came here looking for answers but we still do n't really know for sure how she had died			0
‘ my son is missing her massively			0
the children have become clingy , they try and cheer me up over it , but it 's so hard for all of us			0
’ ms @entity34 , a carer , added : ‘ i 've heard of parents deliberately holding chickenpox parties where they bring their children into others who have the virus because they say it is better to get it as a child than an adult			0
‘ but i hope this might urge others to think twice about these sort of things			0
‘ she only broke out in spots the day before and we gave her @entity85 like the doctors told us to do			0
but within 24 hours she was dead			0
‘ we are absolutely heartbroken that we have lost our little girl but we do n't want other mums and dads to go through the same			0
’ the inquest heard how @entity4 had been developed chickenpox , along with her sister @entity92 , two , and five - year - old brother , @entity93			1
in 2008 @entity94 , five , died after suffering from a severe bout of chickenpox but unlike her siblings , @entity4 suffered a severe bout of the illness and was heard to have heavy breathing by her father who checked on her through the night			1
paediatric pathologist dr @entity102 said he could not confirm the cause of @entity4 's death but did say there was some evidence of pneumonia and a cyst in her brain			1
mr @entity33 sobbed during the hearing as the coroner told him he had done everything he could to help her			0
she said : ‘ things came to a head when she stopped breathing and you had to call an ambulance			0
@entity94 died of multiple organ failure after he developed toxic shock , a type of blood poisoning ‘ that happened quickly - from being a generally poorly child with chickenpox to stopping breathing			1
‘ you did absolutely everything you could to get some help , but unfortunately , having been taken to hospital , @entity4 could not be saved			2
‘ it may be that @entity4 was very poorly with chickenpox and as a result she may have had an epileptic fit			1
’ @entity4 was not the first child to die after developing chickenpox			2
in 2008 , five - year - old @entity94 died after suffering from the illness			2
he developed the illness very severely and died of multiple organ failure after he developed toxic shock , a type of blood poisoning			2
chickenpox is usually a mild but infectious disease			0
it takes seven to 21 days for the symptoms to show after infection and people are infectious from two days before the rash appears until roughly five days after			0
around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16 , and for most it 's a mild illness leading to itching , blisters and sometimes a high temperature after having chickenpox the body usually develops an immunity , which stops people getting it again			2
most doctors recommend rest and lotion to soothe itchy spots .			0
