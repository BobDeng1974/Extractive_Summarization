by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 24 may 2013 the study involved 1.5 million people in @entity3 , @entity4 , and the statins involved were fluvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , simvastatin , atorvastatin and rosuvastatin people taking statins face an increased risk of developing diabetes , warn researchers			1
they found a 10 per cent extra risk linked to taking simvastatin – the most commonly prescribed anti-cholesterol drug – which rose to 22 per cent for those taking atorvastatin			1
previous research into a suspected link with statins found a 9 per cent rise in the chance of patients developing diabetes , but the new study looked at specific brands of drug			1
the study involved 1.5 million people in @entity3 , @entity4 , and the statins involved were fluvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , simvastatin , atorvastatin and rosuvastatin			1
researchers identified 471,250 patients with no history of diabetes and who were newly treated with a statin , just over half were women and all were at least 66 years old			0
statin therapy was started between 1997 and 2010 and individuals were followed for a maximum of five years following the initiation of statins , whichever came first			0
the statins included in the study were : fluvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , simvastatin , atorvastatin and rosuvastatin			2
the research used pravastatin - treated patients as the comparison group as this has been shown to have favourable effects on newly diagnosed diabetes in animal models and clinical trials			0
the overall risk of developing diabetes was low but this risk was increased among some patients taking statins			2
the study found between 162 and 407 patients would have to be treated with the various statins for one extra patient to develop diabetes			2
patients treated with atorvastatin had a 22 per cent increased risk of new - onset diabetes , rosuvastatin an 18 per cent increased risk and simvastatin a 10 per cent increased risk , relative to pravastatin			1
in contrast , patients treated with fluvastatin were at a five per cent lower risk and lovastatin a one per cent decreased risk			2
the findings also suggest older patients are at an increased risk regardless of dose for atorvastatin and simvastatin or whether therapy is used for prevention in people thought likely to develop heart disease or to stop it worsening			2
the researchers say several factors may explain the increased risk of new - onset diabetes among patients receiving certain statins including impaired insulin secretion and inhibited insulin release			0
the researchers said doctors should consider risk when prescribing statin therapy and they may want to switch patients to a ‘ low - risk ’ type			0
previous research into a suspected link with statins found a 9 per cent rise in the chance of patients developing diabetes , but the new study looked at specific brands of drug experts say the absolute risk of diabetes is low - far lower than the benefits of statins in cutting heart attacks and deaths			1
more than eight million adults take statins , with most taking 20 - 40 mg of simvastatin a day			1
they are the most widely prescribed drugs in the @entity132 , with about 61 million prescriptions in @entity134 alone in 2011			0
@entity135 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity137 , said : ' statins are taken safely by millions in the @entity132 and protect those at high risk of developing coronary heart disease			0
‘ although this study suggests an increased risk of older people developing diabetes when taking certain statins , other risk factors like being overweight , family history and ethnicity may have played their part			1
‘ there are benefits and risks with all medicines so if you ’re worried , discuss your concerns with your gp			0
in the meantime , getting plenty of exercise and eating healthily will reduce your risk of developing both diabetes and coronary heart disease			0

the study involved 1.5 million people in @entity3 , @entity4
for the first time it looked at specific brands of drug
found 10 per cent extra risk linked to taking simvastatin - most common
