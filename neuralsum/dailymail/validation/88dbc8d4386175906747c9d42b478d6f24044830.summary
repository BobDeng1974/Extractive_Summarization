according to sources close to the @entity6 host , he is keen to return to the corporation after he was suspended last week for a ‘ fracas ’ with his producer , @entity31			1
mr @entity0 , 54 , is said to be furious with the way the @entity1 has treated him , and is particularly angry that a high level @entity1 executive compared him to the serial paedophile @entity34			1
he has instructed lawyers to demand a retraction and demanded a full investigation into who spread the smear			0
both he and mr @entity31 have now given evidence to an internal investigation into their ‘ dust up ’ , and a verdict is expected within days			0
mr @entity0 allegedly split mr @entity31 ’s lip with a punch after a long day of filming , when the @entity6 host was offered cold cuts instead of the hot steak he wanted			2

he feels that the @entity1 has gone too far with smearing him over it , but the aim is to come back to @entity6			2

@entity0 was suspended last week for a ‘ fracas ’ with his producer , @entity31 , pictured however , introducing a new executive minder between mr @entity5 and mr @entity0 would help it avoid what a source described as some of their most embarrassing ‘ excesses ’			1

a senior television source added : ‘ it ’s entirely a management issue			0
the @entity1 has no strong managers so @entity0 and @entity5 were left to do what they wanted			1
’ the two men have been certainly been caught in a string of scandals , after mr @entity5 allowed his friend to use racist language and make other offensive remarks on the show			2
last year , the tv host was forced to apologise after he was filmed using the n - word in the old - fashioned rhyme ‘ eeny , meeny , miney , moe ’			0
