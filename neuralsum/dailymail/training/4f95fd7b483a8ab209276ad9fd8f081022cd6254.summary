the pair pooled their expertise to set up @entity22 , which will start selling the tea in shops this week			1
the drink , which contains no real tea , was launched at the @entity46 dog show in march and hundreds of orders have already been placed on the firm ’s website			1
‘ people loved the idea of being able to sit down and have a cup of tea while their dogs had one as well , ’ explained mr @entity32 , 47			2
‘ we ’ve already sold out of our initial stock so we are making additional bags			0

’ a lovely cuppa : @entity66 shows his enthusiasm for the brew , a mixture of herbs , vitamins and minerals which , it is claimed , will help dogs live a ' happy and healthy life ' mr @entity32 and mr @entity36 worked together with holistic vet @entity77 , who carried out research into the medical benefits of certain herbs , to create the five blends of canine tea – ‘ adult ’ , ‘ senior ’ , ‘ @entity85 ’ , ‘ performance ’ and ‘ breath ’			1

to brew the tea , owners are told to infuse the bag for four minutes in hot water , before adding cold water to cool the cuppa to suit canine tongues			2
