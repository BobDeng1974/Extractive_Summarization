they always say hemlines rise with the stock market , so the return of the short skirt on the @entity7 , the catwalk and celebrities everywhere must be a cracking good sign for the economy			1
a good thing , too : they ’re fun , fashionable and feminine			2
the only thing is that dealing with a deficit of skirt fabric is no easy matter — especially when , like me , you ’re over 40 and a mum of three			1
there ’s the key ‘ how short is too short ? ’ question ( depends on height and leg shape ) and the issues of cut , colour and fabric			1
of course , the dangers are manifold			2
you definitely do n’t want to go so short that you become a ‘ 1661 ’ ( those who look 16 from the back , but 61 from the front ) or become a walking advertisement for your mid-life crisis			1
here , we pick from the crop of @entity7 offerings to see which are short and sweet — and which should be given short shrift			1
but as the colour is discreet and the cut is a subtle flare rather than fitted , it ’s almost dignified			2
it would be even more flattering with my beloved black opaque tights ... 4/5 @entity55 and @entity56 @entity58 sweater , £ 165 , @entity59 skirt , £ 45 , oasis - @entity61 courts , £ 58 , topshop.com this ‘ bell ’ shape puffs out like an upside - down flower , which should make your legs look thinner			1
but it reminds me of the puffballs of the @entity71 , which made me look like a blob			2
2/5 red delight red skirt , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com @entity75 , £ 44.95 , massimodutti.com necklace , £ 80 , stelladot.co.uk boots , £ 495 , russellandbromley.co.uk this skirt is well - made , with a hidden zip , two pockets and proper lining			1
it ’s a steal at the price and you could dress it up or down			0
it would be hard to be negative wearing this — but do n’t stand too close to a post box ! 3/5 tweed treat @entity90 skirt , £ 68 , johnlewis.co.uk @entity92 blouse , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com shoes , £ 149 , reiss.com this jewel - toned @entity95 line skirt is a lovely cut , lined with a concealed zip			1
the sparkly tweediness feels a little @entity99 - like			1
you could wear it with cashmere , or a shirt and jacket			0
it would do you for the office , a party or parents ’ evening			0
pricier than some , but worth it			0
5/5 @entity113 metallic skirt , £ 35 , and beaded top , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com @entity116 , £ 175 , russellandbromley.co.uk an ‘ event ’ skirt : a party staple that looks as if you ’ve made an effort			0
it felt beautifully expensive : i ’d never have guessed it was @entity125			0
just do n’t wear it with any more gold because you ’ll look like an oligarch ’s wife			0
5/5 @entity131 @entity133 skirt , £ 18 , @entity134 sweater , £ 95 , and shoes , £ 159 , reiss.com this fine knit skater skirt is a flattering shape , but it has a very thin fabric with no waistband to speak of and no zip			0
you just pull it on like a sock			0
on the hanger , it looks as if it will be unforgiving , but it actually works well with a draped top , which suits me as i dislike tucking things in			0
the streamlined , fitted body of the skirt with a flared hem is more flattering than a full - on bell shape			2

shorts skirts have returned to the @entity7 for all to try
but the *age* - old question of ' how short is too short ' is a common one
mum of three , @entity161 , has taken a selection of those on offer and *put* them through their paces
