by @entity1 reporter published : 16:07 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 12 august 2013 third round : jury selection got under way in a third murder trial of former @entity7 state trooper @entity6 , who is accused of killing his wife and two children in 2000 a third trial of former @entity7 state trooper accused of murdering his wife and children in 2000 got off the ground monday after his two previous convictions have been overturned on appeal			1
prosecutors and defense attorneys began questioning 150 prospective jurors in the trial of @entity6 to determine whether @entity6 is guilty of shooting and killing @entity20 , 35 , his 7 - year - old son @entity22 and 5 - year - old daughter @entity21			1
defense attorney @entity24 said both sides began jury selection by weeding out people who had hardships that would prevent them from serving or who had already decided @entity6 's guilt or innocence			1
the trial was moved to @entity33 in hopes that an impartial jury could be found			0
the slayings occurred more than 100 miles away at the family 's @entity38 home			1
the former state trooper has spent a majority of the past 13 years behind bars following two convictions in deaths of his family , even though higher courts threw out both verdicts over inadmissible evidence			2
the 49 - year - old @entity6 insists he was wrongly convicted , and this trial is another chance to clear his name			1
for @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity20 's parents , this is another shot at closure			2
' it ’s like that movie @entity59 , where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day , ’ mr @entity57 said			0
the @entity6 slayings are one of @entity7 ’s longest - running murder cases , following a tangled legal path riddled with missing murder weapons , allegations of affairs and child abuse , the emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor ’s removal over a book deal			1
bloody tragedy : @entity20 , 35 ( right ) , her son , @entity22 , age 7 ( left ) , and daughter @entity21 ( center ) , age 5 , were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in september 2000 for years , a debate has raged over whether @entity6 is a villain or a victim , with both sides taking to websites , books and national television to argue their points			1
a petition on @entity92 seeking to have him freed has collected hundreds of @entity93 have moved the trial to @entity95 , @entity7 — in hopes of finding jurors who have n’t already made up their minds about @entity6 ’s guilt or innocence			1
another challenge for prosecutors is making a legal argument that resonates with jurors after the two previous failures			0
@entity6 , who had left the state police four months before his family was killed , was arrested a few days after telling investigators he had discovered his wife and their two children shot to death in the garage of their @entity38 home september 8 , 2000			1
the weapon was never found			0
defense attorneys argued at @entity6 ’s first trial in 2002 that prosecutors ignored evidence that another man had been in the garage where killings occurred			2
after @entity121 linked a violent ex-convict to the scene , they thought @entity6 would be freed			2
instead , prosecutors said @entity6 had conspired with the second man to kill his family , and he was convicted again in 2006			2
the second man , @entity125 , is serving a 225 - year prison sentence for murder and conspiracy to commit murder			1
legal fumbles : @entity6 ( center ) has been found guilty twice , but both convictions were later overturned on appeal conspiracy theory : ex-con @entity125 ( left ) was convicted of the murders and sentenced to 225 years in prison , but the prosecution believes he was acting in concert with @entity6 ( right ) @entity125 ’s palm print was found on @entity20 ’s suv , and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to @entity125 in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement			1
both times , appellate courts ruled that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury , in the first trial by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs with @entity6 , and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter without any evidence to back up those statements			2
the third trial is expected to last at least six weeks amid heightened security at the @entity158 , about 25 miles northwest of @entity159			0
@entity161 prosecutor @entity160 , who won the second murder conviction against @entity6 , wo n’t be there			0
he was removed after signing a book deal regarding @entity6 ’s case , though he said the deal later was dropped			0
the @entity167 plan to be in court , hoping for closure and a chance to heal			0
‘ hopefully one day we 'll wake up and this will never have happened			0
but common sense tells you it wo n’t be that way , ’ @entity57 said			0
crime scene : @entity6 told investigators that he returned from a game of basketball on the night of september 28 , 2000 , and discovered his family slain in the garage of their @entity38 , @entity7 , home resting place : the grave site of @entity20 and her two young children , @entity187 and @entity21 both @entity6 and @entity188 were born and raised in @entity189 , @entity7			1
the two met in 1988 and got married a year later - three years after @entity6 had divorced his first wife			2
also in 1989 , @entity6 was accepted into the @entity192 as a trooper recruit			0
the young couple had their first child , @entity22 , in 1993 , followed by @entity21 in 1995			2
according to some accounts , the @entity198 ' relationship took a turn for the worse shortly after the birth of their son , with the husband allegedly starting an affair with another woman , which culminated with him briefly moving out of the house			0
by the time their daughter was born , however , the @entity198 ’ life appeared to be back on track			0
the family finished construction on their new house on @entity216 in @entity38 , and things were seemingly going well , with @entity6 serving as a state trooper with the @entity219 , and his wife advancing her career as a well - paid financial analyst			1
in march 2000 , about four months before the killings , @entity223 resigned from his post with the state police and went to work for his uncle , who owned a basement waterproofing business			0
september 28 , 2000 , began like most days in the @entity6 household , with @entity20 waking up at 6am , followed by @entity6 and their kids a short time later			1
the husband kissed his family goodbye and left for work			0
about an hour later , mrs @entity20 headed out with the children , dropping off @entity22 at his elementary school and @entity21 at her pre-school			1
after making arrangements with her parents to stop by later in the day , @entity20 drove to her work at @entity241			0
at around 4pm , she left to pick up her daughter from school and take her to dance practice			0
after 6pm , @entity20 took her son to his swimming practice at @entity247			0
shortly after 7pm , the @entity198 set out for home , located about 11 miles away			0
meanwhile , @entity6 left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church , where he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of friends			0
costly case : it is estimated that by the time @entity6 's third trial reaches its conclusion , the state will have spent $ 4million in taxpayers ' money on the case grieving parents : @entity55 , left , and @entity57 hold a photograph of their daughter @entity20 in their @entity189 home seeking closure : in an undated photo , @entity55 and @entity57 , center , are seen in a family portrait from @entity273 of 1999 with their daughters @entity20 , left , @entity276 , right , and their grandchildren @entity21 and @entity278 just before 9.30pm , @entity279 placed a frantic call with the @entity281 , where he had worked for 10 years , reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home			1
the prosecution , however , rejected @entity6 ’s version of events , accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women			2
during his first trial , the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of september 28 testified in @entity6 's defense , telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders			1
but the prosecutors claimed that @entity6 could have sneaked out to meet up with ex-convict @entity125 and kill his family			1
@entity6 was convicted the first time in 2002 , but the verdict was thrown out two years later , the @entity303 reported			2
he was found guilty a second time in 2006 - a conviction that was also overturned on appeal in 2009 , when the @entity308 ruled that prosecutors inflamed the jury by making baseless accusations that @entity6 had molested his daughter			1
it is estimated that by the time @entity6 's third trial reaches its conclusion , the state will have spent $ 4million in taxpayers ' money on the case .			1

on september 28 , 2000 , *bodies* of @entity20 and her children , @entity22 , 7 , and @entity21 , 5 , were found in their @entity38 , @entity7 , home
@entity6 , 49 , was found guilty in 2002 and 2006 , but both convictions were overturned
ex-convict @entity125 is serving 225 - year sentence for the family murders after he was found guilty as @entity6 's *accomplice*
it is estimated that the prosecutions of @entity6 will cost total of $ 4million in taxpayer money
