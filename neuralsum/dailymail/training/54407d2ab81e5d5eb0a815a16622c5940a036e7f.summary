it has already infiltrated the four corners of the globe with its cameras , meticulously building up an online archive of street - level photography			0
however , not content with documenting virtually every inch of the planet 's landmass , @entity6 is preparing to take its @entity11 feature to new depths when it ventures into the underwater world			2
soon , users will be able to ' swim ' around @entity17 's @entity16 from the comfort of their own home - simply by going online			1
they have now stitched 50,000 photographs together to create the @entity31 , a sub-aquatic version of @entity33			1
the groundbreaking project will allow users to go on a virtual dive of up to 100 metres while surrounded by stunning scenery and beautiful ocean life			1
initially , users will be able to view the reef on the @entity31 map but , in the future , the whole project is to be integrated into @entity43 by the internet giant 's @entity46 tool - giving users a 360 - degree view of the @entity49			1
how it might look : users will have the chance to navigate their own way around the coral reefs , as this mock - up shows virtual diving : users will be able to ' swim ' around @entity17 's @entity16 from the comfort of their own home it is part of the first comprehensive study to document and reveal the composition and health of coral reefs on the @entity16			1
scientists hope any data gathered from the project will strengthen the understanding of how climate and other environmental changes are affecting eco-sytems like the @entity16			2
professor @entity73 , from the @entity71 institute at the @entity72 , believes the visual nature of the project will bridge the gap behind scientific knowledge and public awareness			2
he said : ' the @entity31 comprises a series of studies which will reveal to the public one of the last frontiers on @entity11 : the oceans			0
@entity82 : the @entity84 camera allows users to get up close to the reefs from behind their laptops virtual dive : the equipment used by the divers carrying out the @entity31 , a sub-aquatic version of @entity33 say cheese ! a diver swims among the fish and coral reefs as he films with the @entity84 camera ' for the first time in history , we have the technology available to broadcast the findings and expedition through @entity6			1
' millions of people will be able to experience the life , the science and the magic that exists under the surface of our oceans			0
this project is very exciting			0
' over the coming years the @entity31 - carried out by @entity11 - intends to expand globally to reveal the oceans in regions of importance all over the world			0
the project can be viewed at @entity116			0

users will be able to tour the @entity49 in @entity17 from the comfort of their own home
more than 50,000 photographs have been ' stitched ' together to create a virtual dive 100 metres under the ocean 's surface
project forms part of the first comprehensive study of the composition and health of the coral reefs
