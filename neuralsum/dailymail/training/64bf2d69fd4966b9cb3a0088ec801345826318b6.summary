by @entity0 she might have been spending the day in the mountains but that certainly did n't mean letting her sartorial standards slip			0
@entity6 's @entity5 @entity4 was with her husband @entity7 and two adorable daughters and managed to look every inch the yummy mummy in a pair of casual chinos and a pretty printed t - shirt			1
the royal couple and their daughters are currently on their annual holiday to the @entity19 party isle , and have been spending much of their time relaxing in the @entity22 just outside capital @entity24			1
instead of lines of jager bombs and drunken fumbles on balconies , the @entity6 royals spend most of the time on their yacht , @entity46 , and the rest enjoying private dinners interspersed with the occasional official visit			0
but there 's more to @entity37 than relaxing on yachts and avoiding @entity39 as the royal couple and their daughters discovered this morning			2
the striking @entity54 were recently declared a @entity55 in recognition of the extraordinary agricultural techniques used on its precipitously steep slopes , and the royals began their day with a visit to the newly opened visitor centre in @entity30			0

like the @entity5 , whose annual trip to @entity96 combines family time with official visits , the @entity6 royals spend part of their holiday meeting well - wishers and conducting engagements			2
unlike the @entity104 monarch , however , the @entity6 royals rarely host visiting heads of state at the @entity106 , although some well - heeled visitors do get to see inside			0
one group of visitors who did were the @entity111 and the @entity112 , who joined the @entity6 royals for a holiday in @entity37 in 1988			1
like @entity5 @entity4 and @entity7 who posed for photos on the steps of the palace on the day they arrived , the @entity104 royal couple joined former @entity120 and his wife @entity121 for pictures along with their children - a three - year - old prince @entity124 and a five - year - old @entity125			2
the @entity104 royals also spent time on @entity46 , with prince @entity127 photographed teaching @entity124 how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest , @entity130 of @entity131			0
