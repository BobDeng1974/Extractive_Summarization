by @entity0 and @entity1 rather than apologizing for his drunken rant in a viral video in which he declared his father owned ' half of @entity8 , ' @entity3 student @entity2 has decided to go on the offensive by threatening to sue the people who embarrassed him			1
the @entity12 reports that legal action was hinted in a statement from attorney @entity15			1
' this is a shameful exploitation of a young man who was clearly protecting himself and his friends from unwanted intrusions into their private lives at a vulnerable moment , ' @entity15 states			0
scroll down for more @entity3 student @entity2 , 20 , wants to sue the people who posted a video of his drunken rant that left him the talk of the internet ' our client takes this blatant violation of his civil rights seriously and intends to take all appropriate measures to ensure that this video ’s publishers and all those who have and continue to disseminate it are held legally accountable			1
' @entity2 , 20 , provides plenty of laughs in the short video clip in which he attempts to intimidate the person filming him with some rather grandiose - and seriously ill - judged – boasts			2
‘ this your property ? my dad is in f * * kin ’ real estate , you ’re gon na tell me this your property ? my dad owns half of f * * king @entity8 , ’ the student from @entity53 , @entity48 screams at the cameraman			1
the footage starts with @entity2 and his equally well - oiled friends causing a nuisance outside a dry cleaners on @entity59 in @entity8			2
a blonde girl attempts to help a man in a blue shirt stand up straight , while @entity2 takes issues with the man filming them			0
the man with the camera explains that his is unhappy about them loitering on his property and so @entity2 attempts to one up him by claiming that his father is in real estate and ' owns half of f * * king @entity8			1
' when asked his name , @entity2 responds ' @entity75 , ' adding later that ' i ’m a f * * king lawyer			1
' the footage starts with @entity2 and his equally well - oiled friends causing a nuance outside a dry cleaners on 28th street in @entity8 @entity2 apparently used the phony surname because his drunken friend - who by this point is on the pavement - is himself an @entity75 , a wealthy @entity85 real estate family who do n’t own half of @entity8 either			2
eventually the drunken students depart the scene , but not before @entity88 utters another classic lines : ' you think i do n't own the cops ? ' and ‘ do you want me to call [ @entity85 mayor ] @entity94 on you right now ? ’ since waking up with a hangover and realizing his embarrassing exploits are all other the internet , @entity2 has done his best to disappear by deleting his @entity99 and @entity100 accounts			2
unfortunately for @entity2 , he was n’t able to delete everything about him online and @entity102 has reported that surprise , surprise , @entity105 was n’t being totally honest with his idle boasts			0
his father is n’t a property magnate , but rather @entity108 is a garment industry executive , while his mother @entity109 is an event coordinator and member of the @entity112 zoning and planning board			1
@entity2 's attorney has called the video a violation of his client 's civil rights perhaps deservedly @entity2 is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ‘ over-privileged ’ and ‘ an insufferable rich - kid			1
’ but it appears this member of @entity3 ’s @entity124 is n’t all bad and his accomplishments include co-founding a charitable organization called @entity127 that helps low - income immigrant families in @entity130 , @entity48			0
if this latest incident was n’t embarrassing enough for @entity133 , it has also helped to shine a spotlight on his past as a former thespian			0
at age 13 , he played the @entity137 in a community center production of @entity139 , a @entity141 adaptation produced by his mother			0
the musical included ' unbelievable hip hop dance routines ' and a script that ' was recreated with a @entity147 twist , ' according to a @entity149 clip			0
perhaps deservedly @entity2 is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ' over-privileged ' and ' an insufferable rich - kid '			0

@entity2 , 20 , is the talk of the internet after his drunken exploits on a @entity8 street were captured on video
@entity2 's attorney @entity15 has called the video a ' blatant violation ' of @entity2 's ' civil rights ' and threatened legal action
the @entity3 student and his three friends were loitering after an *alcohol* - *fueled* *brunch* , when a man started filming them
@entity2 's attempt to get the man to stop included boasting that ' my dad owns half of f * * king @entity8 '
the drunken student then claims he is a ' f * * king lawyer ' and gives a false name
his father is n't a property magnate , but rather a garment industry executive
