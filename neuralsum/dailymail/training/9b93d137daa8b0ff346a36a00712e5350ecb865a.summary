the 14 - year - old schoolgirl hanged herself in her @entity13 bedroom nine days ago , after being bullied relentlessly by internet trolls via her page on the popular website ask.fm			1
she is the latest of five similar deaths which have all been linked to the social network			2
@entity19 ( centre ) - whose sons @entity22 ( l ) and @entity23 ( r ) own the controversial @entity4 website linked to the recent suicide of @entity7 teenager @entity6 - has hit out at her grieving parents , blaming them for the tragic death of their daughter @entity19 with her boys in 1986			1
she said : ' of course , i sympathise with them			2
it is awful to lose your child like this but , i 'm sorry , it is all to do with how you raise them ' @entity6 , 14 , hanged herself in her @entity13 bedroom nine days ago , after being bullied relentlessly by internet trolls via her page on the popular website @entity37 last week , the website ’s founders , wealthy @entity4 start - up entrepreneurs @entity41 and @entity42 , aged 34 and 29 , came under fire from relatives of @entity6 and the other dead teenage users , provoking advertisers to boycott ask.fm and prime minister @entity47 to urge parents to stop their teenagers from using the site , which attracts 60 million users			1
but now the mother and father of the @entity55 - born brothers have hit back , denying that their sons are in any way culpable and instead blaming the parents of suicide victims for failing to police their use of the internet			1
@entity63 , a cosmetologist whose sons have become web millionaires from the site launched in 2010 , told @entity67 : ‘ i heard about this suicide case in the @entity7 but i do not understand why my sons are to blame			1
‘ what are they guilty of ? i think we 'd better look instead at the parents of these teenagers and at the way they brought them up , ’ she added defiantly in her first comment on @entity6 ’s death and the string of teenage suicides linked to @entity37			1
‘ of course , i sympathise with them			2
it is awful to lose your child like this but , i ’m sorry , it is all to do with how you raise them			2
‘ i am a mother and i would be worried if my child stayed online a lot			1
but i do not understand why my sons are being blamed for this			1
’ told that a key feature of ask.fm is the alleged anonymity it gives web bullies , which critics claim her sons failed to address , despite earlier suicides , she said : ‘ sorry , but i understand very little about how these social networks work			1
i do n’t like using social networks			0
the mother and father of the @entity55 - born brothers deny that their sons are in any way culpable over the death of @entity6 row : @entity37 has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts ‘ i do not know who is anonymous there and who is not , you better ask my sons			1
’ she insisted : ‘ i believe they do worry about this , too			0
’ though her close - knit family has become wealthy – with several homes in the country ’s upscale white - sand @entity116 resort of @entity119 , where prices are on a par with southern @entity122 , while her sons own penthouses in the capital @entity125 – she said : ‘ this ask.fm project belongs to my sons but i do n’t use it			2
i prefer face - to - face communication , as we had before			0
’ meanwhile , her husband , former @entity131 soldier @entity130 , 57 , when asked about @entity6 ’s suicide , replied : ‘ you know what people say – 99 per cent of people who eat cucumbers eventually die			1
’ his attempt at a joke , along with his wife ’s remarks , are certain to cause hurt for relatives of teenagers who took their lives after using @entity37			1
they will also be a setback to the ask.fm crisis management exercise launched by the brothers , involving top - end public relations specialists in @entity7 and the @entity151			0
last week this led to an ‘ open letter ’ in which the owners called @entity6 ’s death a ‘ true tragedy ’ , and a vow that ask.fm is co-operating with police over her death and has the technical ability to unmask her cyber bullies to the police , plus a commitment ‘ to improve our site and its safety features ’ to ‘ ensure our users and their parents do not lose confidence in our social network ’			1
@entity6 and her father @entity172 when she was a baby and and as a teenager they also appointed top @entity176 legal firm @entity175 to conduct ‘ a full and independent audit of our site and its safety features ’ amid claims the site has been ‘ maligned ’ by unfair criticism			1
the brothers – who refuse to give interviews and remained hidden from view last week – said they were ‘ committed to safeguarding against bullying and harassment in all forms ’			0
however , there will be fears the family ’s true views are expressed by their parents			0
mr @entity42 refused to say if he would advise his sons to alter the controls to protect young people			2
‘ i have n’t talked to them yet			0
i ’m out of the country and have a lot of work on			0
i am solving some problems , ’ he said			0
asked if his sons ’ failure to tighten controls after earlier suicides was because of the profits they raked in , he said : ‘ no , this is not true			2
look , there are a lot of other social networks			0
what guarantees do they give ? ’ mr @entity42 echoed his wife , declaring : ‘ my children did what they wanted when they were young			0
but you can always stop using the social network if you feel uncomfortable			0
’ as the @entity19 parents ’ spoke , details emerged of the real views of the brothers – who boast glamorous girlfriends and drive expensive cars – which may shock many ask.fm users			1
@entity22 has dismissed gays as ‘ these fools ’ on his ask.fm page , while @entity41 has stated : ‘ i would not lie next to a homosexual even in the morgue			2
’ he is also on record as wanting to bring back a @entity231 law banning homosexuality and has shockingly written : ‘ i feel good about cannibals			0
i do not see a big difference between eating pig , cow or human flesh			0
’ the family of patriarch mr @entity42 came to @entity4 after @entity239 subjugated the country following the @entity241			0
expressing loyalty to the @entity55 , mr @entity42 said he can never forget ‘ to whom i gave the oath ’ , slamming ‘ narrow - minded ’ @entity245 and ‘ drunkard ’ @entity246 for destroying @entity55 might			0
he and his wife were pushy parents who demanded academic excellence from their sons			2
both boys shone at school before graduating from the @entity254 in @entity125 .			0

@entity6 , 14 , hanged herself nine days ago after being bullied by internet trolls via her page on popular website @entity37
