the research , published in @entity14 and @entity15 , reveals how the number of couples registering children to foreign surrogates has almost trebled in the past five years			1
the demand by @entity22 couples for women to give birth to their babies is shown by the number of ' parental orders ' granted to parents - which enable the child to be taken from the surrogate			2
the process , driven particularly by @entity34 agencies , was completed 47 times in 2007 and 133 in 2011			0
but the real figures are believed to be much higher , and experts have warned of the increasing exploitation of women living in poverty who undergo the pregnancies to raise money			1
their wombs are typically rented for between £ 10,000 to £ 20,000			1

' she added the official figures did not reflect the real number of children born in @entity34 to foreign parents			2
@entity89 , a lawyer specialising in surrogacy cases , said important regulations were in place to protect children at risk from international trafficking , but there were no safeguards in place for overseas surrogacy			2
the practice follows a decline in international adoptions , which has plummeted to its lowest point in 15 years			0
the number dropped from a high of 45,000 in 2004 to an estimated 25,000 last year , according to research by @entity108 , an expert on international adoptions at @entity2 's @entity109			2
