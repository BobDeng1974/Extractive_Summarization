@entity0 has revealed he would have taken the @entity2 job had he been offered it earlier this week - but felt it was always destined to go to @entity4			1
@entity0 was one of the names closely linked with the vacant managerial position at @entity2 as the @entity8 club seek to replace @entity9 , who walked out on the eve of the new season			1
even though he felt @entity4 was favourite for the role , @entity0 met with @entity2 co-chairman @entity13 last weekend and the former @entity15 boss admits he would have accepted the role had the chance arisen			1
' my feeling at the time was that the race was already run and that the job was going to @entity4			1
but in the end i thought it would be a worthwhile experience			2
' after seeing @entity13 and i asked people who knew @entity2 well about the club			0
their immediate response was that they could not put me off the job			2
the feeling was that @entity2 was a good club and that the best thing about it was the current group of players , as well as the fans			0
' if i had been offered the job early in the process , soon after my interview , i would have taken it			1
naturally , i am confident in my ability to do it			0
' however , @entity0 , who left @entity15 in may after six months in charge , admitted the longer the process went on and the more names became linked to the job , he decided it was not for him			1
the 45 - year - old added : ' i know a lot of managers were interested			0
but at some point , as a manager , you want to know the interviews have stopped and you 're the club 's first choice			0
' that was why , on thursday night , my agent sent a message to @entity13 to say that i was no longer interested in being in contention for the job			2
' favourite : @entity4 was poised to take over at @entity2 before the @entity68 scandal was revealed by @entity69 as well as @entity0 , the likes of @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 have been linked with the @entity75 post , along with @entity4			1
@entity4 had been firm favourite to be appointed this week prior to allegations of racism and homophobia lodged with the @entity80 by @entity81 , which also forced the resignation of @entity2 's sporting director @entity83			1
@entity0 added : ' there are some serious allegations made against @entity86 and he will have to deal with those			1
when i went to see @entity13 last sunday , @entity86 was still very much the lead candidate			0
i liked @entity13 and i thought that his passion for the club was impressive			0
' @entity83 was one of the people in the room during the interview			0
that did nothing to change my mind that @entity4 was the favourite			2
' regarding his future , @entity0 added : ' i am back in @entity99 this weekend watching games and training sessions and continuing my education			2
i have lots of invitations to do that at other clubs in @entity99 and around the world , and i intend to take them up			0
i will be ready when my time comes to return the game			0

@entity0 concedes he would have replaced @entity9 had he been offered it soon after his interview
the former @entity15 boss was in the running for the job at @entity75
however @entity0 always felt the job would end up going to @entity4
