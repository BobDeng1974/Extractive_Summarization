my initial impression is that this 33 - man squad errs slightly on the defensive , cautious side			0
it is nonetheless full of high - quality players who are well capable of enjoying a big november			2
@entity7 need to win at least three , ideally four , of their games against @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 next month , with @entity12 the most important by far as we face them in the @entity14			1
as much as we heap praise on the @entity18 nations , already this @entity7 side will be nobody ’s opposition of choice in a @entity14 match			2
teams would much rather face @entity24 , @entity25 or @entity26			0
@entity27 is the right man to captain @entity7 but might be better used on the other side of the scrum @entity7 will be aiming to win the @entity31 ( left ) and the @entity32 vs @entity9 and @entity12 @entity35 wing @entity33 has earned his @entity7 selection after scoring six tries in seven matches @entity40 captain @entity39 would be best deployed at @entity41 , rather than at flanker team a is the side i ’d pick to play @entity9 from @entity47 ’s squad			1
@entity48 is my line - up — excluding injuries – if i had picked the squad			0
@entity52 assumes everyone is fit			0
( personnel and positional changes are in capitals ) team a : promising @entity58 , @entity33 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity27 ( captain ) , @entity39 @entity48 : exciting @entity58 , @entity33 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity27 ( c ) , @entity72 , @entity39 @entity73 : off the scale ( 85,000 fans would be off their seats if this team clicked ) @entity58 , @entity33 , @entity78 , @entity60 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity63 , @entity79 , @entity65 , @entity80 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity27 ( c ) , @entity72 , @entity39			1
with 12 tests to go before @entity7 ’s opening @entity14 game against @entity85 , there is still huge scope for fine - tuning in the camp			1
as i wrote earlier this week , a coach needs to wake up feeling excited and confident about the team he is putting out for a big match			0
using that as my guide , i have selected three @entity7 xvs to demonstrate how i feel the team could and should develop in the next year or so			2
a successful autumn will send our @entity10 , @entity100 and @entity12 friends home with a lot to think about , and leave us entering @entity14 year with momentum			1
momentum is everything in @entity14 year			0
@entity106 ( in the first green box , above ) is the @entity7 team i would pick to play @entity9 on november 8 from the squad @entity47 named on wednesday			1
team b is the @entity7 side i would pick and includes three players not in the 33 - man squad			2
i consider @entity72 available ! @entity52 takes into account those currently on the injured list and assumes they are fully fit			2
if i was an opposition coach , @entity52 would keep me awake at night			0
you could coach @entity52 to play an irresistible style of attacking rugby			0
@entity70 should have been selected to add some magic on the wing for @entity7 @entity72 should also be included in spite of the fact he plays his club rugby in @entity26 @entity71 should be selected at @entity123 with @entity60 playing outside him in the centres november 8 vs @entity9 november 15 v @entity10 november 22 v @entity11 november 29 v @entity12 @entity106 features most of the best we saw in @entity9 with the addition of @entity33 , who is stepping up to the plate at @entity35			1
i ’d have @entity62 at fly - half for his attacking skills while the pack is already a mighty unit			1
i would want both @entity27 and @entity39 in my team so @entity39 would play no 8			0
in @entity48 , i ’d make four changes , three in personnel and one positional – all designed to up the attacking threat			0
i ’d make a straight swap at fly - half and bring in @entity71 for @entity140			1
attack is the big strength of both players and there is no question we needed to see @entity71 start against one of the big teams , to observe him under pressure but also to give him the chance to play behind that very strong go - forward @entity7 pack			1
i would also bring in that magician of a wing @entity70 for the match - winning moments of brilliance he can conjure from nowhere			2
do n’t deny yourself his firepower because of any perceived defensive weakness			0
in the pack i would tinker with the back row			0
i want to see @entity72 at openside in a match that matters but i love what captain @entity27 brings to the team , so i would ask him to play blindside			0
finally @entity52 is my team that would give us the absolute best chance of winning the @entity14 on home soil			0
i ’d bring in a fit and injury - free @entity78 at outside centre , keeping the all - round skills and world - class goal - kicking of @entity60 at 12			1
the passing , running and left foot / right foot kicking options of @entity71 and @entity60 would give @entity7 the attacking options you need at the very highest level			1
in the pack , if fully fit , @entity79 and @entity80 are as good as any props in the world and would complete a truly formidable @entity7 line - up			2
@entity7 will kick off their series against the @entity9 , who are captained by flanker @entity187 @entity47 's side also face @entity14 pool rivals @entity12 , who often turn to @entity191 for inspiration @entity10 will also travel to @entity193 , with lock @entity194 hoping to make his presence felt			1

@entity47 has made a conservative selection for the @entity199 series
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 all *overlooked*
@entity7 need to win at least three of their @entity193 *fixtures* in november
series opponents include @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity12
@entity60 should be played at inside centre , not at fly - half
