by @entity0 published : 16:29 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 7 august 2013 @entity0 tests two different ' seasonal ' @entity1 the wedding was straight out of the pages of a magazine			1
the bride wore @entity6 , the vows were exchanged in a garden overlooking @entity9 and the lunch was five courses of pure heaven			2
but the thing i remember most about my friend 's perfect wedding last summer is just how hot i was			1
it 's not that the temperatures were particularly scorching - in the pleasant mid- 20s at most - but i still spent the celebration sweating like a pig on a spit , and looking about as attractive as one			0
by the end of the day i was so hot and bothered i was ready to pass out			0
the cause of this discomfort ? my industrial - strength @entity29 pants			1
i had bought the thickest and longest pair possible - the ones that go from your knees to your bust and suck you in so tight you can hardly breathe - in a bid to get away with the long , clingy dress i 'd bought for the wedding			0
it never occurred to me in the cold @entity41 changing room that being trapped in some sort of giant compression bandage would not be the most comfortable attire for a @entity46 summer 's day			1
by the start of the evening , my shorts had been peeled off - after a five - minute battle in the loos - and all my lumps and bumps were wobbling in gay abandon on the dance floor			0
i learned my lesson that day - that summer and support wear do n't mix. it 's one of those cruel facts of life that the very time you need slimming the most - thanks to both a glut of weddings and lack of opaque tights - is the time that you have to go au naturel			1
or is it ? @entity29 - which are worn by everyone from princess @entity69 to @entity70 , @entity71 to @entity72 - also offer a summer - friendly range it insists will help you keep your cool			1
the @entity76 range , first introduced last year but re-launched this summer with extra support panels , is made of lightweight breathable fabric , designed to tone lumps and bumps without causing hot flushes			1
the range of shorts , slips and body shapers , which claim to firm the tummy , hips , thighs and bottom , have been created with ultra-light , sheer fabric , a cotton gusset and a ' non-binding ' unseamed waistband that wo n't dig in or create lumps and bumps			1
@entity29 even includes a mysterious item called the ' skort ' , which , for the uninitiated , is a pair of shorts with a skirt over the top			1
the benefit being that if your dress or skirt rides up , you look like you 're wearing a slip rather than a pair of control pants			1
it all sounds great on paper , but can they pass the comfort test during our hottest summer in years ? i decide to try them out			1
@entity0 test drives the summer @entity1 and the ' skort ' , which means if your dress flies up in the breeze it will look as if you are wearing a slip rather than control pants i start with a pair of @entity76 shorts ( £ 44 )			1
the first impressions are good - they 're delicate , semi-sheer and nicely silk to the touch			0
more sexy stocking than @entity132			0
in fact , the nude blends so well with my skin i can hardly see them and they 're extremely comfortable			0
i tried them out under an unforgiving jersey maxi - dress , which normally shows up every lump and bump			0
they definitely smoothed out my silhouette , lifted my bum and controlled my tum - but , i have to admit , they did n't suck everything in quite as much as my old industrial - strength wedding shorts			0
that 's because @entity29 's 200 products ( who knew women needed trussing up in so many different ways ? ) fall under three categories : medium support , which ' smoothes your figure and offers a close , yet comfortably forgiving fit ' ; @entity162 support , which ' shapes your body and flattens your stomach ' ; and @entity166 support , which ' powerfully transforms your physique targeting specific problem areas with zoned compression '			1
@entity29 come in shorts or skirt format - known as the ' skort ' - for breeze - related emergencies the summer @entity1 , it turns out , offer only the medium support - so they 're lightweight in more ways than one			1
the real litmus test , however , came when wearing them out on a scorching @entity41 day			1
the temperature was in the early 30s and i was getting on and off the @entity181 and sitting in the park			0
but far from causing me to overheat , they were so comfortable that i forgot i was wearing them until i undressed again that night			2
the next day i tried them out under a pair of light @entity187 , which always show my knicker line			0
these trousers fitted comfortably when i bought them last summer but now cling like leggings , thanks to a year of over-indulgence on the ice cream front			2
the shorts made them fit much better - no vpl and my bum looked less saggy , my tummy much flatter			2
' the good news is that no matter what crazy shapes i was making , my skort stayed in place without being too constricting or making me overheat ' in fact , they sucked in my tummy so much i realised that for both days i 'd worn them , i 'd been eating less			2
there 's just not enough room to tuck into that extra helping			0
could @entity1 actually force me to diet ? i wondered			0
next up , i tried the @entity210 ( £ 52 ) under a shortish summer dress that i 'm usually too self - conscious to wear			2
i do n't like my bare legs and am always worried that a gust of wind is going to reveal too much cellulite to the world			0
the skort may be a ridiculous word but it 's a good solution to this rather universal problem			2
a flimsy - looking bubblegum pink undergarment , this acts as both a slip and shorts in one , promising to keep both your dignity and wobbly bits under control			1
when my skirt did fly up with a gust of wind , my pink slip stayed in place and looked much more respectable than a beige pair of @entity1 would have done			2
@entity0 gives the skort a thumbs - up ... in spite of the silly word again , i wore it all day and felt perfectly cool and comfortable			1
for the ultimate test , i took my skort to a wedding in @entity243			1
the sun was blazing and the marquee felt like a furnace			0
i 'd like to say that i stayed cool as a cucumber throughout but that would n't be strictly true			0
only this time , it was n't my undergarments that were making me sweat like i was at an aerobics class - i blame @entity253			0
or whatever else the @entity255 was playing that kept me on the dance floor all night			0
the good news is that no matter what crazy shapes i was making , my skort stayed in place without being too constricting or making me overheat			2
by the end of the night my head spun , my heels hurt but my wobbles stayed firmly under control			2
what more could a girl ask for ?			0
