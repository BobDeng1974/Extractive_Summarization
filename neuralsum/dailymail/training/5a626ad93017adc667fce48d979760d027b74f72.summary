' they are an intriguing creature with a leg - span of up to 18cm , which date back to the first age of the dinosaurs , ' @entity7 told @entity58			0
unlike common garden spiders which have a life span of one or two years , the @entity9 cave spider lives for decades and takes nine months to hatch from an egg			1
describing the creatures , @entity7 said they 're much larger than a classic huntsman , and similar in structure to a redback , but without the distinctive colour and many times bigger			0

' the @entity9 cave spider is equipped with fangs and venom			1

but life is n't all good for the male of the species			0
' they have to perform this fascinating courtship dance to attract the female , who are often taken by such surprise that they lash out and eat their hopeful partner , ' he said			0
