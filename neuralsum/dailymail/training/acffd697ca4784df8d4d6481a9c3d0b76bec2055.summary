by @entity1 reporter published : 10:51 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 11:27 est , 6 september 2012 @entity2 has unveiled the handsets it hopes will help it take on @entity5 and @entity6 in the smartphone war			1
the firm launched two new handset running @entity11 's software , and also unveiled a recharging ' pillow ' that does away with the need to plug in a cable			1
however , the ailing firm saw its share price plummet before the announcement had even finished			1
phone expected to go on sale later this year , price @entity23 ' this is the most innovative smartphone in the world , ' said @entity26 , senior vice president of @entity27 , as she held up the @entity20			1
' this is @entity29 , and it ’s time to switch , ' she told an audience in @entity32 in a clear encouragement for users to desert their @entity35 or @entity37 handsets			1
however , investors seemed to disagree			1
@entity2 's share price dropped by over 10 percent during the firm 's announcement as investors remained unconvinced by the firm 's mobile strategy			1
an hour after the event began the share price was down 11.48 percent to $ 2.51 per share , suggesting the tie - up with @entity11 was poorly received			1
the firm also revealed a midrange handset , the @entity49			1
styled to match the current @entity52 flagship , the @entity20 and @entity49 both have a glossy polycarbonate frame that ’s light and described as ' comfortingly warm to the touch '			1
on the 820 the case is swappable for other colours			2
the screens ( measuring 4.3ins on the 820 and a palm - stretching 4.5ins on the 920 ) are both pin - sharp and high - resolution			2
they even had a new app to offer effects like shop and restaurant names floating in the street as you look at the screen			2
@entity2 also boasts they can be used with gloves on			1
capacitive touchscreen displays respond to the electric conductivity in the human hand , so gloves have always been a no - no. the @entity20 , however , has @entity75 which is designed so you can use it with ski gloves on your hands			1
@entity2 's @entity20 uses a pillow to charge , meaning no cables have to be plugged in the @entity20 comes with wireless charging so you do n’t need cables – just plonk it on a wireless charging mat like the @entity87 pillow			1
@entity2 is using a popular standard of wireless charging so that multiple devices will work with these chargers			1
when software updates , music and video can all be downloaded to the phone over the air , one day you may never need to plug it in			2
the @entity20 includes @entity100 technology – @entity2 ’s name for its camera system			1
the phone does n’t match the @entity104 launched in the summer with its @entity106 sensor and chunky profile , but at least this @entity109 model is slim as a result			2
@entity26 stressed that the @entity20 uses ' revolutionary camera technology ' that it ’s claimed will collect between five and ten times the light of many cameraphones			1
' it ’s better than most digital slrs , ' she insisted			1
new camera software also made it easier to add extra effects as you shoot – very like @entity123			2
@entity26 executive vice president of @entity2 introduces the new @entity20 phone with @entity127 operating system at a launch event in @entity32 there ’s a very neat feature called @entity131 which is ideal when someone walks in front as you ’re taking a shot			1
the camera takes multiple snaps and allows you to remove moving objects like a careless passer - by			2
other effects allow you to add video elements to still shots and image stabilisation helps guard against blur			2
the @entity20 also has @entity145 – near @entity146 – the contactless data system used in door entry systems and the @entity150 ’s oyster cards			1
though this technology has still to be widely used in mobiles , the plan is it will turn the phone into a wallet			2
it can also be used with suitable speakers and headphones to transfer music playback with one tap			2
the handsets revealed this afternoon are slim , slick - looking devices with features to bring about the end of the charging cable			2
they look great : eye - poppingly bright with high contrast and deep blacks and vivid colours			0
the screen also promises blur - free scrolling of text and improved visibility in bright sunlight – something that defeats many smartphones			0
the big question remains – will all this be enough to drag people away from @entity37 and @entity35 ? the hardware is certainly deeply attractive , the processor seems nimble and responsive , the new screen is immersive and the camera has many neat features			0
but @entity2 may find the lure of the @entity35 is hard to beat , especially with the @entity35 announced next wednesday			1
but just as important as the hardware is the software that powers the phones			0
@entity11 ’s @entity191 operating system was launched two years ago as an alternative to the all - conquering @entity35 and @entity37 systems			0
but it has failed to dent their massive market share , capturing under 3 per cent of smartphone sales , according to research firm @entity198			1
so today ’s launch also showed off the new version of the software , called @entity202			0
@entity11 ’s mobile phone plans are dependent on the success of today ’s launch , too			0
@entity202 is strikingly different from @entity5 ’s ios and @entity6 ’s @entity37 systems			0
on the @entity35 , to move from one app to another you need to quite one , return to the home screen and launch the other			0
it ’s a bit like walking from your bedroom to the bathroom but having to go via the front door			0
with @entity191 , the screen is populated with a ribbon of squares called @entity220 which constantly refresh			0
so the @entity221 shows your @entity223 and @entity224 contacts , say , while one with your personal details updates every time a relevant addition arrives , like a text message , status update and so on			0
today ’s announcement revealed more about the new version of @entity191 , and @entity11 ’s @entity231 claimed today as an important milestone , with a user interface that ’s ' truly unique ' in what he claims will be ' the year for @entity235 '			1
the tiles are now resizable and capable of displaying more information such as how many messages are waiting from particular people in tiles dedicated to them			0
all 100,000 @entity191 apps will work on the new phones , but some yet - to - be - released apps may utilise new features incompatible with earlier models			0
there are still dedicated @entity235 apps like a neat @entity249 program that turns the phone into a satnav with turn - by - turn directions but , unlike most others it works without costly data charges when used abroad			0
the sister app @entity256 now has maps which can be downloaded in advance , and also used without data costs			0
these apps can even calculate how long your commute will take			0
so you ’ll have no excuse for being late			0
new today is @entity264 , which adds @entity266 effects			0
point the phone at a city street to see shop and restaurant names that seem to float in the air , overlaid on the display ’s image			0
these highly attractive effects can also be used in the maps apps			0
other new features include a much - demanded screenshot function , handy if you want to upload what ’s on your screen to @entity224 , say , or save the contents of the display so you do n’t lose the information when going into a network - free area .			0

share price dropped by over 10 percent during the firm 's @entity20 announcement as investors remain unconvinced
@entity2 boasts new @entity20 can take pictures ' better than most digital slrs '
handset can be charged simply by placing it on a pillow
