by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it is a fixture weighted in @entity4 history ; two finals , red cards , mass brawls , humiliations , penalty shootouts and more			2
@entity10 versus @entity11 will climax the latest edition of football ’s showcase tournament in @entity16 's @entity15 on sunday			1
it will be the third time they have met in the final – a record – having clashed in 1986 and 1990 , and seventh time in total			2
crowning moment : @entity23 lifts the trophy following @entity10 's 3 - 2 victory over @entity11 at @entity26 there has been no shortage of incident , either			1
here , @entity30 takes a look at their previous @entity4 encounters , starting with the two finals … italia 90 final : @entity11 1 @entity10 0 let us deal with the minor details first ; @entity11 won 1 - 0 thanks to an @entity39 penalty five minutes from time			1
for this final will forever be remembered for the savagery of the @entity42 , and this from a team which included @entity23			0
the captain , however , was complicate in the underhand tactics of his side , who were intent on spoiling their way through to penalty kicks			0
protest : @entity23 argues with the @entity53 referee after @entity54 was sent off on @entity55 : @entity11 celebrate their victory in @entity58 by the time @entity39 ’s winner arrived , @entity10 were already down to 10 men , @entity54 the first man in the history of the @entity4 to be sent off in a final , a crude chop on @entity64 his crime			1
@entity66 followed him for a second bookable offence three minutes from time and the @entity71 shame was complete			0
@entity72 86 final : @entity10 3 @entity11 2 despite being contested in the searing midday heat of @entity76 , the two teams still found the fervour to share six bookings , which was a record until 2010			1
happily , however , this final will be remembered for the five goals they also shared and the crowning of the marvellous @entity23 as world champion			0
@entity10 were 2 - 0 up thanks to @entity86 and @entity87 with just 15 minutes remaining			1
cool : @entity87 puts @entity10 2 - 0 up amid the heat of the @entity89 in @entity76 moment of glory : @entity92 scores the winning goal past @entity93 in the @entity95 goal but the introduction of powerhouse frontman @entity98 - brother of @entity99 - had unsettled the @entity42 and @entity100 and @entity101 capitalised to draw @entity11 level			1
as @entity100 later recalled , however , they were greedy and chased victory , affording @entity23 a momentary yard to unpick their backline and spring @entity92 clear and he did the rest with a cool finish six minutes from the end			0
@entity111 2010 quarter - final : @entity11 4 @entity10 0 file this one under ‘ humiliation ’ , for @entity23 ’s @entity10 were out - thought and out - fought by the young @entity95 - and the majority of the protagonists will again take to the stage in @entity16 on sunday			1
indeed , as many as 18 players involved in @entity119 are likely to feature in this weekend ’s final			0
head boy : @entity122 heads @entity11 into an early lead in @entity119 net gains : @entity125 strikes late on to seal the 4 - 0 victory @entity11 had already crushed @entity127 4 - 1 in the last 16 but this was even more emphatic , especially given the favouritism of an @entity10 side boasting a front three of @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			1
it took just three minutes for @entity122 to head the opener and , while @entity10 did threaten parity early in the second half , @entity11 put the tie to rest with two goals in six minutes courtesy of @entity125 and @entity143			2
@entity125 volleyed a fourth late on to compound @entity23 ’s misery			0
@entity11 2006 quarter - final : @entity11 1 @entity10 1 ( @entity11 won 4 - 2 on penalties ) memory of this meeting exists outside the confine of 120 minutes – in which @entity125 had equalised @entity151 ’s headed opener - and for a penalty shootout and subsequent brawl which was , predictably , coined the @entity154			1
spot - kick misses from @entity151 and @entity156 were punished by four successful @entity95 efforts but an ill - tempered melee ensued in which @entity10 substitute @entity159 was sent off			0
spot of bother : @entity162 saves @entity151 's penalty to send @entity11 into the last four relief : @entity11 celebrate their victory on home soil @entity154 : but a mass brawl broke out following the shootout @entity127 1966 @entity170 : @entity11 0 @entity10 0 having both enjoyed victory in their opening group matches , it was a case of damage limitation at @entity175 as the pair settled for the point which kept them at the top of the table			2
both , of course , were ultimately beaten by @entity127 , @entity10 at the quarter - final stage and @entity11 in the final			2
@entity184 1958 : @entity11 3 @entity10 1 @entity185 opened their defence with a comfortable victory in @entity188			2
despite falling behind in the third minute to an @entity191 strike , the champions were ahead by half - time thanks to goals from @entity194 and @entity195 and the former added another after the break			0
the match was remembered for @entity10 wearing the shirts of host city @entity200 after forgetting to bring their change strip			0
