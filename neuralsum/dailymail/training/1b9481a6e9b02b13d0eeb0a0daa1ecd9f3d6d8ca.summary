she 's like , " what if they take me ? " ' police also pulled over the van after some of the parents placed 911 calls and the video shows their interaction with the police officer			1

' thank you guys , ' one wrote			0
' as a father of 3 i am glad that the people that watch this video will understand how easy it would be to just pull up and grab a kid from anywhere			0

@entity75 and @entity76 staged a kidnapping of a *relative* 's child in @entity12 , claiming they *wanted* to raise awareness of the crime
a video shows them donning masks and grabbing the boy while *distraught* parents in the park try to chase them and help the boy
afterwards they return to the park to explain and are met with anger
the police also pulled them over and said they were going to shoot them
the cousins said they called police just before the hoax but authorities said they did not consider that sufficient warning
police are still *deciding* if the men will face charges
