thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided , saving the @entity4 £ 300million , by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks , it is claimed			1
academics have calculated the likely reduction in consumption caused by putting up the price of full sugar drinks like @entity13 and @entity14 and the resulting health benefits			1
the work by experts at the @entity18 and the @entity19 will fuel the growing campaign to extend the principle of a duty on unhealthy products from cigarettes and alcohol to some types of drink and food			0
however , the drinks industry have challenged the figures , insisting a sugary drinks tax will only hit the poorest in society with higher living costs while doing nothing to improve their health			1
the @entity50 team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre – 12p per can – would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years			1
they estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer			1
@entity63 , co-ordinator of the @entity19 , said a 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across @entity67 these figures relate to @entity67 alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of £ 300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years , releasing money for other patients			1
soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged 4 - 10 years and teenagers , consequently any new levy would particularly hit consumption among this group			2
money raised from the charge would support a new @entity86 , which would pay for sport and fitness schemes and equipment for youngsters			0
the campaign for a sugary drinks duty is supported by over 60 organisations , including public health and medical professional bodies , dentists , children ’s charities , action on @entity100 and school food experts			1
@entity63 , co-ordinator of the @entity19 , said : ‘ current taxes on foods are a mess , and do n’t support people choosing healthier options			0
‘ a 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across @entity67 , and ease the pressure on @entity4 services locally			2
it is a logical , proportionate and effective measure			0
‘ using the revenue to set up a @entity86 , paying for programmes to improve children ’s health and protect the environment they grow up in , would also ensure that this was a progressive measure , benefiting families in poverty and on low incomes			0
’ public health directors in @entity124 and in @entity125 , as well as the @entity126 , have publicly backed a sugary drinks duty			1
professor @entity128 , the @entity129 ’s scientific adviser , said : ‘ a tax on sugary drinks and food is a no brainer			1
it 's a scandal that one in eight of our three - year olds currently experiences tooth decay			0
it 's time we tackled the problem at source			0
’ health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill - health as the ‘ new tobacco ’ the research looking the impact of the levy was led by @entity152 , @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity18 , who has created a model showing the effect by local authority area across @entity67			1
this found the areas likely to see the biggest benefits by virtue of the fact they have a younger population and higher consumption of the drinks were @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			0
@entity176 , the director of @entity177 , which is supported by @entity178 in the north west of @entity67 , said : ‘ just as extra taxes on cigarettes have helped to change purchasing habits and reduce smoking , adding 20p per litre onto the price of sugary drinks would encourage people to consume less and lead to improvements in quality of life			2
‘ we want to see the next @entity191 introduce a sugary drinks duty without delay			2
’ @entity194 , which is an alliance of local community groups , said : ‘ we are calling for a @entity86 to enable a step - change in early intervention			0
since there is no spare money in the @entity4 , we are calling for a duty on sugary drinks , which will itself reduce diabetes and obesity			1
’ director of the @entity206 @entity205 , @entity207 , rubbished the research and its figures			0
he said : ‘ this is a flawed model based on misleading figures created by campaigners in support of their cause			0
the overwhelming evidence suggests that ill - health is linked to a range of factors including lifestyle , levels of exercise and overall diet			0
‘ a tax on soft drinks would adversely impact the poorest in society while doing nothing to curb obesity			2

experts believe there should be a 12p tax cans of sugary drinks like @entity14
they believe tax will reduce cases of diabetes by 50,000 over 20 years
cases of stroke and heart disease would also be cut by around 33,000
health campaigners likened sugar 's impact on health as the ' new tobacco '
