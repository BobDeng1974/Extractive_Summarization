by @entity0 last updated at 2:42 pm on 13th february 2012 @entity2 students celebrated the 50th birthday of @entity4 - one of the earliest computer games , written in 1962 on an @entity2 computer the size of a fridge			1
the game was written by four students in 1962 on a @entity12 ' minicomputer ' - last week , @entity2 students built a new version that ran on a palm - sized electronics rig , based on the original code programmed 40 years ago			1
it was one of the earliest computer games , and arguably the forefather of all arcade - style space games			2
the game was programmed by four @entity2 students in 1962 on a @entity23 - 1 ' minicomputer ' , a fridge - sized device			1
the online version uses the same 40 pages of computer code to run the code of the game runs to 40 pages , and it can still be played online , in a version constantly updated to run in the latest browser code			2
the game was created in a room known as the ' @entity35 ' at @entity2 , where computing students would play around with the latest hardware			1
the hulking @entity12 ' minicomputer ' was a relatively modern machine , with controls that allowed an ' action packed ' game where two spaceships battled one another around a sun which pulled them in with gravity			0
the game is the ancestor of games such as @entity50			2
