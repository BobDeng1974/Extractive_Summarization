@entity0 may be best known for country estates and cream teas , but the trust 's new exhibition will take place in a council flat in east @entity7			1
in 1967 the @entity9 , in @entity8 , was completed and for two months the following year its architect , @entity10 , lived in apartment 130 to prove how desirable his new building was			1
now , as part of a display on brutalist architecture , the @entity0 has restored the flat to its original 1960s style , and is inviting the public to look around			1
as part of an exhibition on brutalist architecture , the @entity0 has given flat 130 at the top of @entity9 in east @entity7 a 1960s makeover and will be opening it up to the public from october 1 the tower was completed in 1967 , and the following year it 's designer , @entity10 , moved into flat 130 in an attempt to demonstrate the appeal of high - rise living a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ' @entity9 , along with its younger sister @entity32 , is a testament to a particular moment in time when a vision of a utopian post-war @entity36 coincided with @entity37 – an architectural movement that changed the landscape of our urban environment			1
' this was intended to be a heroic architecture that sought to offer the best of design to the masses and to free people from the slum housing and poor conditions still prevalent in 1960s @entity36			1
' designer @entity50 and his daughter @entity51 scoured market stalls , auctions and @entity54 in order to give the flat and authentic 1960s look			0
everything , from the @entity57 stacked on shelves , to the @entity61 bed cover , and posters of @entity63 in the teenage bedroom is from the period			0
for smaller items , such as the bottle of aftershave and can of @entity71 in the bathroom , the pair were forced to raid the @entity74 museum , in @entity75			0
@entity10 was born in @entity76 but emigrated to @entity77 after the fall of the @entity79 , and moved to @entity36 in 1934 after marrying @entity80 , heiress to the @entity82 and @entity83 food company fortune			2
@entity10 ( left ) , a @entity76 communist , moved to @entity36 in 1934			2
he designed the headquarters of the @entity86 , before building the @entity9 and its sister building , the @entity32			1
@entity89 author @entity88 so hated @entity10 that the writer named one of his villains after him designer @entity50 and his daughter @entity51 scoured auctions , markets and @entity54 to give the flat an authentic @entity96 feel			2
everything from the furniture , to the wallpaper , and even the board games , is from the period a supporter of communism , he spent his years before the @entity104 living in @entity105 , and after the conflict began designing buildings for the likes of the @entity110 newspaper and the @entity86			0
for @entity10 , who was so despised by @entity89 author @entity88 that the writer adopted his name for a villain in his books , high rise living was the future of @entity36 in the @entity96			1
he saw building upwards as a way to keep more green space open for people to enjoy at ground level , a mission he shared with the founder of the @entity0 , @entity124			1
he also saw high rise towers as a way to solve the chronic lack of housing in @entity36 , and move the poor out of slums and into better quality apartments			2
the @entity132 was his first experiment with tower blocks , having built several terraced homes in @entity136 , north west @entity7 , including his own house at 2 @entity138 , which the @entity0 also looks after			1
it was the design of this property that first drew the anger of @entity88 , after he opposed the demoluition of several cottages to make way for it			0
@entity10 saw high - rise living as a way to provide low - cost housing to the poor and solve the chronic lack of homes in post-war @entity36 , while also keeping green space for smaller items , such as records , a bottle of aftershave and a can of @entity71 , the designers also raided the @entity74 museum , in @entity75 the block would later be used as a blueprint the blueprint for its sister building , the @entity32 in west @entity7 , and sparked a wave of copy - cat buildings across the country			1
however , while apartments in the @entity32 now sell for upwards of £ 500,000 , @entity132 became known for violence , crime and poverty			0
@entity132 itself is in the process of being renovated , with current residents being housed elsewhere until the building is finished			0
council tenants who want to move back in will be allowed to do so , while those who want to leave will be rehomed , and their flats sold off to private investors			0
the apartments currently sell for £ 155,000			0
the @entity9 pop - up exhibition will run for two weeks , beginning on october 1			0
while @entity9 sparked a wave of copy - cat social housing across the country , as an experiment in high - rise living it ultimately proved a failure , becoming synonymous with poverty , crime and violence			2

@entity10 designed @entity9 in east @entity7 and lived in flat 130 on the top floor for two months in 1968
now the @entity0 has given it a 1960s makeover and will open it to the public as part of a @entity37 exhibition
@entity9 was the architect 's first tower block and *inspired* sister building , the @entity32 , in west @entity7
@entity10 saw high rises as a way to end the housing *shortage* in post-war @entity36 while preserving green spaces
