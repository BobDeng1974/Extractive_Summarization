@entity0 are in talks with former @entity3 player and @entity5 coach @entity4 to take over as head coach – with the man once famous for being @entity9 ’s first signing in @entity11 football now favourite to take over the job from @entity13			1
stand - in coach @entity14 has been told to take the job for another week but with @entity4 , who quit @entity5 at the end of last season , ready to take charge immediately he is moving ahead of candidates such as @entity22 boss @entity21 , who has said he wo n’t move until the summer			1
@entity4 won the @entity23 during his team at @entity5 and is close to @entity0 chief scout @entity25 , who will have a big say in whom owner @entity27 and managing director @entity28 appoint			1
@entity14 , whose team went down 2 - 0 to league leaders @entity42 on saturday , still wants the job full time and said : ‘ i still have n’t had a conversation with @entity27 but i ’ve have a conversation with @entity28 and he said : “ look after the game against @entity42 and possibly @entity47 ” and that ’s what i ’ll do			1
‘ now that this game is out the way we ’ll have tomorrow off , we ’ll be back on the training ground on monday and until i ’m told otherwise i ’ll prepare for the next game			2
i ’ve no idea when they ’ll make a decision but if the guys play like they did today then hopefully they ’ll make the right decision			2
’ @entity4 and @entity21 have long been admired from within @entity60 – but @entity21 will not walk out on his current contract in @entity62			2
‘ i will stay here until the end of the season , that 's for sure , ’ said @entity21 , whose side are currently fourth in @entity64			0
@entity14 has been caretaker manager of @entity0 since the departure of @entity13 @entity13 steered @entity69 to a 2 - 1 win over @entity71 in his first @entity73 game on saturday ‘ i have no intention of leaving the club during the season			1
it would be a lack of respect towards the club , the directors			0
but from there to say that i 'll stay until the end of my contract … things happen quickly in football			0
at the moment i 'm really enjoying working here , but one day it will end			0
but i 'm very clear about things			0
‘ it will end on good terms , properly , with a lot of respect and consideration from all parties			0
afterwards i 'll go to work in a place where i 'll find the same atmosphere , that 's very important for me			0
’ @entity21 ’s decision to stall , however , could cost him his shot at the @entity0 job .			1
