he says @entity24 and her children came to the house without knowing it was the boy 's , walked on to the property and right to the partially buried body			2
mr @entity21 says he searched the area previously himself without seeing it			0
this revelation comes the same day that the boy 's father , who lives in @entity42 , said that @entity2 was not autistic and that he had spoken to him before he disappeared when the boy asked him if he could go visit			2
the 11 - year - old had lived with his father , @entity46 , in @entity42 up until 2001 when he went to live with his mother @entity47 in @entity18			1

vision : @entity24 was volunteering during the search for the missing boy and had a ' knowing ' of where she should go to look for the body near home : the boys lived with their mother and her partner in the home center right , and @entity2 's body was found in a shallow grave by the tree back to the left , only 100 feet away police have not released any official motive for the alleged murder , but psychic @entity24 said that she had a bad feeling about the half - brother			1
ms @entity24 , who lives in @entity76 , was driving around @entity17 with her children in the car as they helped look for the missing boy			0
she told @entity79 that she had a very specific dream about the boy 's whereabouts			0
' i had this knowing that he was in a certain direction and whichever way i would turn i would know which direction to go , ' she said			0
arrested : @entity2 's half - brother , seen here , has not been publicly identified but was taken in by police on wednesday on suspicion of @entity2 's murder			1
he was formally charged with the crime on friday ' that 's the building i saw in my vision , and it was very distinctive and it was like this - it 's giving me chills to even think about it now - it was like this open tack shed			2
' they went towards a fenced - in area near a tree behind the family 's home and she ' something that smelled dead '			0
minutes later they spotted the top of @entity2 's head poking out of the shallow grave			1
police are still investigating the case and determining the charges that they will press against the teenage half - brother , but for now the family is asking for privacy			1
' everybody has known @entity2 , if they 're lucky , for five minutes ; we 've known him for 11 years and we have 11 years of grieving to do , ' @entity47 's partner @entity49 said			1
reeling : @entity49 ( pictured ) , @entity2 's mother 's longterm lesbian partner , said that the family is grieving heartbroken : the boy 's father , @entity126 ( pictured ) , is a retired truck driver who lives in @entity42 and he said that - in spite of @entity130 's claims - he did not believe his son was autistic @entity47 initially described @entity2 as an autistic boy who took special medication and answered only to his nickname , ' @entity135			1
' his father , however , insisted that his son was not autistic , saying he was a normal kid who loved video games and baseball , he said			0
' he was a very bright , well - adjusted child , at least he was when he left here , ' said @entity46 , a 62 - year - old retired truck driver			1
' he pushed buttons and would aggravate you			0
but , other than that , it was just the typical way ... of a typical boy trying to get his way			0
' tragic : the psychic said that she knew she was close when she smelled ' something dead ' in danger : @entity2 , who weighs 76 pounds and is 4 ' 8 " , most likely did not take his medicine with him which will cause problems because he is a high - functioning autistic @entity46 also helped raise the half brother accused in the case , even though he was not his biological father , he said			2
the teen , whose name has been publicly released , moved from @entity42 to @entity18 after his mother abruptly pulled him out of school , he said			2
' i taught him how to walk			0
i helped him when he was on the baseball team here , ' he said , recalling that he called the half brother ' little @entity164			0
' investigators told @entity46 that @entity2 died after a hit to the head but declined to say more , saying he did n't want to jeopardize the investigation			0
