the terrible fate of @entity1 after a nuclear war has been mapped out using computer models for the first time			1
worldwide famine , deadly frosts , global ozone losses of up to 50 per cent and more would greet any inhabitants of the planet still remaining after a nuclear conflict			1
and the researchers hope their study of what they call a relatively ' small ' nuclear war will serve as a deterrent against such weapons being used by any nation in the future			1
they used climate models to predict what would become of the planet after the detonation of 100 ' small ' nuclear warheads , and conclude there would be global devastation			1
pictured is an atomic weapon test in the 1950s the unnerving consequences were laid out in a paper called ‘ multidecadal global cooling and unprecedented ozone loss following a regional nuclear conflict			1
’ year 0 five megatons of black carbon released into the atmosphere , which absorbs sunlight and begins to cool the planet			0
black carbon rain also kills millions			0
year 1 average surface temperature drops by 1 ° @entity45 )			0
year 2 crop growing season is shortened by 10 to 40 days			0
year 5 @entity1 is an average of 1.5 ° @entity49 ) colder than the present day , colder than it has been in 1,000 years			2
there is also nine per cent less rainfall			0
the ozone is also up to 25 per cent thinner , increasing uv rays on @entity1			1
year 10 @entity53 recovers slightly to just 8 per cent less than modern day			0
year 20 planet warms slightly to 0.5 ° @entity56 ) lower than the present day			0
year 26 rainfall increases to about 4.5 per cent less than today			0
in it the researchers looked at the outcome of a ‘ limited , regional nuclear war between @entity62 and @entity63 in which each side detonates 50 15 - kiloton weapons			2
’ they then used computer models to examine the impact on the planet and its environment - and it makes for grim reading			2
the immediate result of 100 nuclear weapons roughly the size of those dropped on @entity76 being detonated would be the release of five megatons of black carbon into the atmosphere			2
black carbon , not too dissimilar to soot , would block out the sun and can also be fatal to humans			0
following a spell of black carbon rain , a deadly weather front that would devastate what remained of humanity following the nuclear war , the temperature of @entity1 would begin to drop			1
after a year the temperature would fall by 1 ° c ( 2 ° f ) , while after five it would be 1.5 ° @entity49 ) cooler than it is now			0
about 20 years after the conflict it would warm again to just @entity96 ( 1 ° f ) below today ’s temperature			0
accompanying what the researchers call ‘ the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1,000 years ’ would be a huge loss in ozone levels			2
they say that global ozone losses of 20 to 50 per cent would occur over populated areas , ‘ levels unprecedented in human history ’			1
the immediate result of 100 nuclear weapons being detonated would be the release of five megatons of black carbon ( shown ) into the atmosphere , say researchers			2
black carbon , not too dissimilar to soot and released from the burning of things such as fossil fuels , would block out the sun and can also be fatal to humans the drop in temperature would produce ‘ killing frosts ’ that reduce the world ’s growing season by 10 to 40 days			0
meanwhile the eradication of up to half of the ozone would increase uv rays in some locations by as much as 80 per cent , raising the chance of developing skin cancer for large swathes of humanity			2
combined with the global cooling , this ‘ would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine			0
’ the planet ’s falling temperature would also decrease the amount of rainfall			0
five years after the conflict @entity1 would see 9 per cent less rain , while 26 years after the war there would still be 4.5 per cent less rain			1
the result of all this would be devastation and ultimately death for hundreds of millions , and perhaps billions			1
but the researchers hope that their example of a relatively small nuclear war between two modestly armed nuclear nations , @entity62 and @entity63 , will encourage superpowers such as the @entity155 and @entity156 to discuss nuclear disarmament			1
‘ knowledge of the impacts of 100 small nuclear weapons should motivate the elimination of more than 17,000 nuclear weapons that exist today , ’ they write			1
in their paper the researchers conclude humanity would suffer worldwide famine , deadly frosts and huge ozone losses			1
the results would be the death of hundreds of millions or billions			1
pictured is the abandoned city of @entity172 , which is still experiencing the negative effects of nuclear fallout from @entity175			0

researchers from @entity21 studied the effects of nuclear conflict on @entity1
they used climate models to predict what would become of the planet
their research looked at the detonation of 100 ' small ' nuclear warheads
in their paper they conclude humanity would have been affected for decades
there would be worldwide famine , deadly frosts and huge ozone losses
the results would be the death of hundreds of millions or billions
they hope their research will be an *incentive* for superpowers to disarm
