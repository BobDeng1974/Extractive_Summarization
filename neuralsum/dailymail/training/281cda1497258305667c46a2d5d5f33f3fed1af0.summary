@entity0 appreciates his @entity2 bosses have endured a ' very difficult ' time handling his relationship with @entity4 this season			1
motorsport boss @entity6 , non-executive chairman @entity7 and executive technical director @entity8 have been forced to contend with a fair share of issues between @entity0 and @entity4			1
the partnership threatened to explode at one point over the course of the @entity14 weekend in late may when @entity0 took pole via a dubious manoeuvre during qualifying that @entity4 believed was deliberate			1
strained : @entity0 ( r ) has admitted his relationship with @entity4 has been hard on the team peace keeper : @entity2 boss @entity6 has had to contend with the fractious relationship between drivers a one - two followed , with @entity0 taking the chequered flag ahead of a furious @entity4 , resulting in neither acknowledging the other during a tense podium ceremony			1
@entity6 and @entity7 did well to keep the lid on that particular saga , and whilst there have been other niggles along the way , for now there is a peace of sorts			1
but with the championship a two - horse race as the duo are separated by just 14 points in the title fight , there is plenty of opportunity yet for the battle to become truly explosive			1
asked whether he felt there would have been more fireworks by now , @entity0 was cryptic with his response as he said : ' you do n't know , maybe there have been more fireworks			2
' pressed on the matter , @entity0 added : ' yeah , but i 've forgotten ! ' it 's always the same , it does n't change			2
it 's neutral , sometimes easier , sometimes with more difficult periods			0
' you just work through the difficult ones and that 's it			0
it has n't really changed			0
' flare up : the @entity58 hinted that there have been more fireworks with @entity4 than revealed playing catch up : @entity4 trails his teammate by 14 points in the driver 's championship for those in charge , though , @entity0 said : ' it 's difficult , very difficult			1
' we need to find a balance because in the first instance we 're racing for @entity2 , representing @entity2 and wanting to do a good job for them			2
' we 're also representing the thousand - plus people - my colleagues - at the factory who have families and who depend on us			0
' so we need to work as a team , but there comes a point where you want to beat the other guy			0
it 's a fine line			0
' that fine line is becoming a well - worn path that could well become a furrow as the season enters the final stretch and the nerves and tension increase			0
in turn , that will apply further pressure on the likes of @entity6 and @entity7 ' it 's a very , very difficult job , ' assessed @entity0			1
' there are difficult periods to manage the whole situation , but we 're very fortunate because we 're set up really well from that point of view			0
' the three of them - @entity7 , @entity6 , @entity8 - more @entity106 and @entity8 who do more of the day - to - day running , i 'm grateful for the way they have managed the team and the situations			1
' they 've done a good job , but it will remain a challenge			0
' need for speed : @entity0 is looking for a first podium in @entity116 but was behind his teammate in practice fine tuning : @entity4 complained about braking during practice in @entity122 @entity0 's challenge this season is to score his first career podium at the @entity126 where @entity4 has won four times in seven years			1
on friday , @entity4 at least continued his love affair with the track as he finished quickest at the end of both practice sessions			2
quickest in @entity134 when the medium - compound tyre was used throughout , @entity132 posted a time of one minute 25.814 seconds , finishing 0.183secs clear of @entity0			2
come @entity139 when the drivers were allowed a run on the soft @entity143 rubber , the faster of the two choices this weekend , @entity4 improved to 1:24.482secs , with @entity0 down by 0.238secs			1
the session was not without its difficulties for @entity2 , though , as @entity4 at one stage complained of a loss of braking			1
that will likely have sounded a few alarm bells on the pit wall in light of @entity4 's accident during qualifying last saturday for the @entity58 @entity14 when he suffered a 30g impact into a tyre wall after a right - front brake disc failure			1
as for @entity0 , there were engine concerns just over two thirds of the way through , although neither man seemed overly burdened as long runs were eventually undertaken			2
close : reigning champion @entity163 was within a second of leader @entity4 during parctice for @entity4 , a lack of grip left him particularly unhappy as he said : ' the tyres do n't feel very good here			2
' there was very , very poor grip out there			0
i do n't know if that 's the tyres or the track , but it was pretty bad			0
' you 're driving so slow to look after the tyres it feels like you have to slow down too much now to the point it 's a bit boring ' so we have some work to do overnight to ensure we get the best set - up for the weekend as we 're not fully comfortable with the car just yet			0
' reigning four - times champion @entity163 in his @entity185 and double title - holder in @entity188 's @entity187 were the only two drivers to finish within a second of @entity4			0
@entity192 's @entity191 was 1.752secs back in ninth , with @entity196 's @entity195 down in 21st and just over four seconds in arrears .			0
