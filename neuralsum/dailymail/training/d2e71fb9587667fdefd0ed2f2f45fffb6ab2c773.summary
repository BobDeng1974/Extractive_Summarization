@entity4 candidate @entity9 stormed from behind on a wave of protest votes to take second place in the poll			1
she won 27.8 per cent of the vote to finish just 1,771 votes behind @entity24 victor @entity24			1
but her leader , who said his party was on the verge of causing a ‘ national political earthquake ’ , faced the charge that his decision not to run had killed any chance of @entity4 winning the seat			2
mr @entity3 said the result , @entity4 ’s best in a @entity7 election , was a ‘ very significant step forward ’ and boasted that they had hoovered up votes from all three main parties			1
he claimed that @entity4 had persuaded voters disillusioned by mainstream politics to go out to vote for the first time in ‘ 20 or 30 years ’			2
mr @entity3 , by far the best - known figure in @entity4 , had been expected to stand , not least because he was the party ’s first - ever candidate in the 1994 @entity13 by - election			1
and while in 2010 @entity4 received just three per cent of the national vote , mr @entity3 picked up 17.4 per cent when he stood against speaker @entity44 in @entity45			2
and recent polls put @entity4 1 per cent ahead of the @entity24 nationally , at 9 per cent			2
asked whether he had ‘ bottled it ’ yesterday , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i have been accused of many , many sins and most of them are true but i could never be accused of bottling anything in my life			2
i would n’t have done any better than @entity53 did			0
’ ' we are not a one man band ' : @entity4 leader @entity3 said he would n't have done any better than candidate @entity9 scraped through : @entity24 , pictured with his wife @entity57 at the @entity8 count , won his seat by just 1,771 votes mr @entity3 maintained that if he had been the candidate it would have reinforced criticism that @entity4 is a ‘ one - man band ’			1
‘ we are not a one - man band , i intend to lead this party into the @entity68 elections in june next year , when we will take the tremor we have created in @entity13 and turn it into a national political earthquake , ’ he said			0
‘ had i stood and i had got more votes and be going to the @entity72 , i would not have been able to lead the party as a candidate in the @entity68 elections next year			0
i believe its in those elections we will come first and cause a real earthquake in @entity79 politics			0
’ @entity4 ’s success opens the possibility that the party could cost the @entity82 dozens of seats at the next general election			0
@entity85 faces : @entity86 admitted the defeat of @entity89 candidate @entity88 , pictured at an event during the campaign , was ' disappointing ' @entity93 's dinner : the @entity82 had named @entity13 as one of its top 40 target seats for a majority in 2015 , but the campaign was overwhelmed by a surging @entity4 mr @entity3 said the @entity82 should lay the blame for their defeat firmly at the door of @entity86 , and added that it was “ unlikely ” that @entity4 would consider a pact with them as long as he remains their leader			1
‘ the conservatives failed here because traditional @entity89 voters look at @entity86 and they ask themselves , “ is he a conservative ? ” and they conclude , “ no , he ’s not ” , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s talking about gay marriage , wind turbines , unlimited immigration from @entity116			0
he wants @entity117 to join the @entity118			0
the conservatives ’ problems are not because of @entity4 , it ’s because of their leader			0
