bike thefts have been slashed at @entity1 simply by putting pictures of staring eyes above cycle racks			1
the two - year experiment was carried out by a security manager at the campus who had seen similar studies suggest that people behave better when they feel they are being watched			1
academics found that bike racks which had eyes placed above them experienced 62 per cent fewer thefts than the previous year , while those without eyes saw thefts increase by 63 per cent			2
watching you : bike thefts have been significantly reduced simply by putting pictures of staring eyes above cycle racks , researchers said today eyes : the two - year experiment at @entity1 was mooted by a security manager at the campus who had seen similar studies suggest that people behave better when they feel they are being watched the crime - fighting idea is now being trialled by @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , with train company @entity29 , on a route between @entity33 's @entity32 station and @entity34 in @entity35			1
professor @entity36 and professor @entity37 , of the @entity38 , and @entity39 , of @entity1 's security team , talk about their findings in the journal @entity42			1
for the first year the team monitored the level of bike thefts from all racks across campus for a control figure			2
crime fighting : @entity39 , one of @entity1 's security team with the signs that the @entity1 have put up around their campus they then placed the eye signs in three locations , leaving the rest of the racks without signs			1
they monitored all the sites for a year to measure the impact on the level of crime , and noticed a major drop for racks with eyes but an increase at those without			1
a 2006 study found that staring eyes made people pay almost three times as much into a tea - room honesty box			0
and research in 2010 showed that people using a canteen were more likely to clear away their tray after a meal when there were eyes watching them			0
lead author of the paper @entity82 said : ' we do n't know exactly what is happening here but this just adds to the growing evidence that images of eyes can have a big impact on behaviour			0
' we think that the presence of eye images can encourage co-operative behaviour			0
one strong possibility is that the images of eyes work by making people feel watched			0
' we care what other people think about us , and as a result we behave better when we feel we are being observed			0
' mr @entity39 , who is deputy team leader for security in the estates security service at @entity1 , said : ' anything we can do to reduce the level of theft on the campus is very welcome			2
' i had followed previous work done by this team and thought it might be able to make a difference to levels of crime , so i decided to suggest this experiment			2
' the results were clear and we have now put these pictures up across all the bike racks on the campus			0
' @entity119 , from @entity28 's @entity120 , said : ' research shows that this sign has had some promising results at @entity1 , and we are always looking at new ways to tackle cycle theft at rail stations			1
' as well as signs at stations and increased patrols at hot - spot locations , we aim to crack down on cycle thieves across @entity35			0

two - year experiment was carried out at @entity1
crime - fighting idea is now being trialled by @entity28
