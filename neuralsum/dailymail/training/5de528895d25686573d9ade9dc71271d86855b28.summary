the @entity0 is over and , for the fourth time in history , @entity1 came out victorious after a 1 - 0 triumph over @entity4 in the final			2
. there were some simply sublime displays in @entity8 , with the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 all putting in a series of utterly imperious displays			2
but in much the same way as for every reaction , there is an equal and opposite reaction - in football for every brilliant player there is an equally terrible one			0
so who were the worst xi in @entity8 ? here , @entity24 runs the rule over eleven men who failed ever so badly in @entity8			1
@entity27 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) @entity28 ( @entity29 ) – had a blooper reel all of his own			1
the mis - control that gifted @entity33 a goal in the 5 - 1 defeat to @entity36 was the pick of the bunch			2
nightmare : @entity40 endured a nightmare couple of games as @entity29 lost to @entity36 and @entity43 @entity44 ( @entity45 ) – his tournament ended when he was sent off against @entity1 for stupidly thrusting his head into @entity48 ’s , leaving @entity45 with 10 men for nearly an hour			0
they lost 4 - 0			0
moment of madness : @entity44 's headbutt on @entity48 in the @entity55 opener cost @entity45 dearly @entity56 ( @entity29 ) – the @entity58 defender suffered more than most in the shocking 5 - 1 defeat to @entity36			0
endured a torrid time and was not seen again			0
passed by : @entity56 was destroyed in @entity29 's opener , before not being seen again in @entity8 @entity62 ( @entity8 ) – has a player ’s stock ever fallen so rapidly ? a contender for @entity67 , @entity62 ’s world caved in as @entity8 conceded 10 goals against @entity1 and @entity36			1
tearful : @entity62 was woeful in @entity8 's horrendous 7 - 1 defeat to @entity1 in the semi-final @entity72 ( @entity73 ) – the @entity73 skipper had already been sent off against @entity75 in a pre-tournament friendly when he saw red for a late challenge in the final group game with @entity79			1
no goals , no assists			0
@entity82 in hands : @entity72 leaves the pitch after receiving a red card against @entity79 @entity86 ( @entity8 ) – the @entity88 man was utterly anonymous much of the time			0
at least his @entity8 teammate @entity91 kept himself occupied by kicking opponents			0
chasing shadows : @entity86 was one of many @entity95 players who was poor throughout the tournament @entity97 ( @entity98 ) – set about @entity79 in the second group game like he wanted to be sent off and got his wish , conceding a penalty in the process			1
why always me ? @entity97 was disappointing for @entity98 in the group stage @entity105 ( @entity106 ) – contributed two assists but we expected so much more from the @entity110 man			1
did @entity111 really say that he ’s the best young player in the world ? underwhelming : @entity105 was disappointing for @entity106 in @entity8 @entity113 ( @entity114 ) – no sooner had @entity113 knocked out @entity75 than he was up to his old tricks , biting @entity117 ’s @entity116			1
the striker was out of the @entity0 and @entity114 were n’t far behind			0
impact : @entity113 had a rather dramatic two games in @entity8 against @entity75 and @entity117 video sorry @entity113 admits @entity116 bite @entity122 ( @entity8 ) – booed into retirement by his own fans , no - one summed up the dearth of @entity8 ’s attacking talent better than @entity122			1
one goal against @entity129 was never going to be enough for his critics			0
out of his depth : @entity122 simply could n't cut it up front for @entity8 @entity136 ( @entity29 ) – all the talk , all the fuss , all that money @entity110 ! their £ 32m new signing showed why @entity29 sometimes prefer to play without a striker			1
not worth the trouble : @entity136 's impact in @entity8 paled in comparison to the hype surrounding him beforehand			2

@entity113 , @entity62 and @entity136 amongst those to feature in worst xi
@entity24 also pick out @entity105 and @entity28 as *underperformers*
three @entity95 and two @entity153 feature in the side
