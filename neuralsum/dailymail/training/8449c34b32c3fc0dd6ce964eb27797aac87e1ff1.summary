by @entity0 warm weather is forecast across @entity2 today meaning continuous sunshine could be on the way for the next 40 days – if @entity2 folklore is to be believed			1
many will welcome the fact the @entity8 is forecasting bright sunshine and temperatures of @entity11 , as superstition states that if the sun shines on july 15 , it will continue to do so for the next 40 days			1
however , the @entity15 ’s day folklore also states that if it rains today , it will continue to do so for 40 days – although most of @entity2 does n’t have to worry as forecasters say there is a ‘ very slim chance ’ of scattered showers across the country today			1
temperatures were expected to reach @entity11 across many parts of the country yesterday before soaring to the late twenties on thursday and friday making @entity2 hotter than some @entity26 holiday destinations including @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1

wednesday also looks promising , with the bulk of @entity68 and @entity69 likely to remain dry and sunny			0

mr @entity58 said there was a chance heavy showers could develop in parts of the @entity2 on thursday before it clears later in the afternoon			2
however , despite the blip , temperatures are expected to rise to a sweltering @entity37 in many parts of the country on thursday and friday , including in the south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the @entity2 over the next few days			1

however , despite the ‘ hot and humid ’ weather , forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some as it will feel muggy instead of fresh			2
@entity8 forecaster @entity122 said ‘ thundery downpours ’ could give brief respite from the hot and sticky weather on friday and saturday			0
she said : ‘ most people wo n't enjoy these conditions			2
it can be difficult sleeping during the hot humid nights			0
‘ although it probably is shorts and t - shirt weather , you will need a brolly at the same time			0
’ many will be relieved it stayed dry to coincide with the folklore of @entity15 's day			0
while legend states that rain on july 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days , it also says that if it remains dry for the day , the country will be in for 40 days of sun. pictured : @entity143 , 22 , wanders through @entity144 in @entity145 despite the ' hot and humid ' weather over the next few days , forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some people as it will feel muggy and sticky instead of fresh			1

for those looking forward to the next wave of warm weather , many will be relieved that it is expected to stay dry today to coincide with the folklore of @entity15 ’s day			0
while the legend states that rain on july 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days , it also says that if it remains dry for the day , the country will be in for 40 days of sunshine			1
the @entity2 folklore dates back to c.800 , when @entity15 was a @entity172 bishop at @entity173			1
as he lay on his deathbed he asked to be buried outside where he would be trodden on and rained on			0
his wishes were followed for nine years , then on july 15 , 971 , the monks of @entity173 attempted to remove his remains to a shrine inside the cathedral			0
this week 's warm weather heralds the start of another hot spell in @entity2 , where temperatures could exceed those in popular @entity26 holiday destinations such as @entity29 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
pictured : a man enjoys a walk through @entity97 in @entity98 this afternoon as the sun makes a break through the clouds according to legend , the removal was accompanied by ferocious and violent rain storms which lasted 40 days and nights and were said to indicate the saint 's displeasure at being moved			1
the story soon became @entity2 folklore and ever since the weather patterns on july 15 have been closely followed by the superstitious			2
the folklore ’s rhyme reads : ' @entity15 ’s day if thou dost rain , for 40 days it will remain			2
@entity15 ’s day if thou be fair , for 40 days ’ twill rain no more			2
' however , the @entity8 has routinely said there is no ‘ scientific evidence ’ supporting the folklore and said numerous studies have been carried out on past weather observations , with none proving the legend to be true			0
it also said that since the start of records in 1861 , there has been neither 40 dry or 40 wet days following the corresponding weather on @entity15 's day			0
while it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40 , there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing			0
by this point in the summer , the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of august			0
the jet stream is a fast - flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere			0
it tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south			0
if it is sitting to the north of the @entity2 , then warm air tends to invade from the south , usually associated with high pressure building in from the @entity245 , leading to fine and settled weather for the @entity247			0
however , should the jet stream sit across the @entity2 or to the south , then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the @entity254 , leading to unsettled weather			2
so far , the jet stream is pointing directly towards the @entity247 , indicating unsettled weather .			0

@entity2 folklore states that if conditions are fair on @entity48 then the sun will continue to shine for 40 days
forecasters predict @entity2 will bask in some of the hottest temperatures of the year so far towards end of the week
many parts of the @entity2 are set to enjoy temperatures of @entity11 today before *mercury* soars to @entity37 on thursday and friday
@entity2 is set to be hotter than some @entity26 holiday destinations over next few days including @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity28
@entity272 will be among warmest places in the country - but forecasters warn conditions will be muggy and humid
