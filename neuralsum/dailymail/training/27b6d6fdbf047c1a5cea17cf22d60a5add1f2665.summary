the colour of their shirts was symbolic and befitted the sombre occasion , matador red being replaced by funeral black			2
@entity6 may have rounded off a demoralising few weeks with a comfortable 3 - 0 victory over @entity8 in @entity9 but there was little appetite for fiesta , no sense that they had achieved some kind of consolation			1
this , after all , was the end of an era			2
from the line - up that had no place for those luminaries @entity24 or @entity25 to the solemn trudge @entity27 made to the touchline and the blank expression on @entity31 ’s face at the final whistle , it felt like the time had come to say goodbye to those who have so entertained			1
@entity35 bow out on high something to cheer : @entity36 celebrates his goal with @entity38 opener : @entity27 's first - half goal set @entity6 on their way to an easy win at the double : @entity45 striker @entity36 makes it 2 - 0 to @entity6 after the break clincher : @entity49 sealed the win with a third goal late on @entity8 : @entity52 6 : @entity53 6 , @entity54 5.5 , @entity55 5.5 , @entity56 6 : @entity57 6 ( @entity58 72mins ) , @entity59 7 , @entity60 6 : @entity61 6 , @entity62 5.5 , @entity63 5.5			1
subs : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			1
@entity6 : @entity72 6.5 ; @entity73 7 , @entity74 7 , @entity75 6.5 , @entity76 7 : @entity38 7 ( @entity77 82 ) , @entity78 7 : @entity79 6 ( @entity80 67 ) , @entity81 8.5 , @entity82 8 : @entity36 7.5			1
subs : @entity25 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity24 , @entity88 , @entity89			0
goals : @entity82 36 , @entity36 69 , @entity49 82			0
man of the match : @entity81			0
for @entity82 , who set the ball rolling with a cute 36th minute back - heel , international retirement looms , as it does for @entity38			0
@entity24 and @entity25 may well follow , while @entity31 has offered to fall on his sword after overseeing such a dismal defence of the trophy they won in 2010			1
changes , clearly , are afoot yet if the last two weeks have been a catastrophe for @entity6 , there can be no disputing that much of the previous six years have been breathtakingly glorious , a period in which our views on how football should be played were redefined			1
it is why @entity6 ’s exit from this carnival should be lamented			1
@entity68 and @entity112 , clearly , deserved to progress at their expense from @entity115 but you can not help but feel the tournament will lack something when magicians like @entity81 are no longer involved			1
@entity120 : @entity121 and @entity36 celebrate @entity122 and tumble : @entity8 's @entity59 challenges @entity81 @entity125 sandwich : @entity126 is crowded out by @entity49 and @entity127 @entity81 , as has so often been the case , was the star of the show , his repertoire of passing too much for a limited @entity8 side to handle			1
this was his 100th appearance for @entity6 and , typically , he used the ball with metronomic precision ; long or short , quick or slow , he always picked the right option			2
@entity31 made seven changes to the team that was humbled by @entity112 in @entity139 last wednesday but @entity81 ’s place was sacrosanct and his presence helped @entity6 negotiate a tricky opening period to get on top in the 23rd minute			1
he ushered in @entity73 with a ball that was both immaculately timed and beautifully weighted , taking advantage of the time and space @entity8 had given him ; @entity73 , who had surged into @entity8 ’s penalty area , picked out @entity82 , who nonchalantly did the rest			0
floored : @entity36 goes to ground under the challenge of @entity53 basement boys : @entity56 reacts after @entity36 scored @entity6 's second this was what we have come to expect from @entity6 : the change of pace , the runs that pull defences apart , the artistic passing and the killer instinct			1
it may have come two games too late but it was proof their gifts had not deserted them			0
it was also a reminder of @entity82 ’s talent			0
a new adventure beckons in @entity174 , then @entity175 , but it has to be lamented he is departing both the @entity178 and international scene			0
he is a wonderful striker , one who has the talents to thrive in the @entity181			0
missed opportunity : @entity82 sees a chance go begging taking a tumble : @entity61 is sent sprawling after a challenge by @entity73 getting shirty : @entity36 changes his top during the game once @entity82 had put @entity6 in front , the outcome was never in doubt			2
the surface in @entity192 may not have been smooth but they still passed @entity8 to death , @entity81 picking out @entity36 for the second in the 69th minute before @entity49 converted a pinpoint @entity80 ball late on			0
that gave the score a realistic look but there were no smiles or warm embraces at the final whistle , no mood for celebration			0
then again , we should not be surprised			0
this era , after all , was supposed to end in a blaze of glory , not with ignominious failure			2
no way through : @entity8 's @entity62 is challenged by @entity127 @entity213 maestro : @entity214 passes the ball off fancy footwork : @entity60 tries to evade the challenge of @entity127 man marking : @entity79 keeps an eye on @entity61 hefty tackle : @entity57 challenges @entity73 from behind			2

@entity6 end poor @entity223 showing with easy win against @entity225
victory not enough to stop @entity6 being eliminated
@entity31 's side finish third in @entity115 behind @entity68 and @entity112
