if that was n’t a satisfactory opening to this article , then you might not be too impressed with the latest app taking internet by storm			1
appropriately named ‘ @entity8 ’ , it lets you send exactly that word to friends and , despite launching on @entity11 , is apparently not a joke			1
in just over two months it has gained £ 590,000 ( $ 1 million ) in funding and now has a growing userbase of about 50,000			1
an app called @entity8 ( logo pictured ) is currently taking the internet by storm			1
since launching in april it has amassed 50,000 users and has apparently been given $ 1 million in funding			1
the app is available to download for free on both @entity24 and @entity25 and lets users send the word yo to others - and nothing else according to the @entity31 the app took just eight hours to build but is quickly proving a hit with its ‘ single - tap zero character communication tool			1
’ the ' yo ' app can be downloaded from the @entity35 or @entity36 for free			1
when the app is loaded up users are asked to pick a username			2
friends can then be invited to the app by text , @entity43 or @entity44			0
when a friend 's username is added , tapping on it will send them a yo			2
they will then receive a notification saying they have received a yo - and that 's it			1
an additional feature involves adding the user ' @entity57 ' , which will then send you a yo every time a goal is scored in the 2014 @entity62 @entity61			2
but you wo n't know who scored without checking up elsewhere			0
other functionality is promised for the app in the future			0
the company boasts that it takes 11 taps to send the word ‘ yo ’ on a rival messaging service like @entity73 compared to just two on their app. however , critics suggest the app is a sign we ’re well and truly in an internet bubble like the one at the turn of the century , and it could be set to crash in a similarly disastrous manner			1
@entity8 is available now on both @entity24 and @entity25 for free			1
there is no ability to sync with @entity43 , no email address needed and no search functionality			0
the app simply lets you pick a username for yourself , and then enter the usernames of friends			2
by tapping on a name it will then send that person a ‘ yo ’			2
they will receive a notification that it has arrived - and nothing more			0
some of the tongue - in - cheek reviews on the @entity35 were quick to eschew the apparent qualities of the app. ‘ since downloading @entity8 , all my relationships have improved and i 've regrown most of my hair , ’ said one reviewer			2
‘ receiving a yo is fast becoming the highlight of my day , ’ added another on the @entity36 store			0
‘ so much mystery ! why is this person yo - ing me ? should i respond ? ’ when the app is first installed you will be asked to pick a username			2
you can then add the names of friends to send them a yo ( left )			0
when a yo is sent the recipient will receive a notification that they have received it ( right ) , and nothing else			0
the company says it is a ‘ single - tap zero character communication tool ' the app ’s founder , mr @entity127 , said the simplicity of the app was the reason it had already grown its userbase to 50,000			1
‘ it ’s zero characters - you ca n’t get any simpler than that , ’ he said to the @entity31			0
‘ we have decided this is an idea with great potential			0
’ and the app is still evolving - users can add the username @entity57 , for example , to get sent a yo whenever a football team scores at the @entity145			1
the identity of the player and team , time of the goal and the score will remain a mystery , though , unless the user checks up elsewhere			0
but the app is seen by some as a sign that the latest tech bubble is set to burst			1
infamously in 2000 many technology stocks lost nearly 80 per cent of their value and @entity159 lost 200,000 jobs , according to @entity161 , when the last tech bubble collapsed			1
however , that has n’t deterred investors from getting behind @entity8			0
the initial $ 1 million was supplied by investors associated with @entity165 , a ceo involved in a social network called @entity168			0
whether the app continues to wide its wave of success remains to be seen .			0

@entity175 company 's app @entity8 is available free on @entity24 and @entity25
it lets users send the word ' yo ' to other users - and does nothing else
it has apparently already received $ *1m* in funding and has 50,000 users
despite being released on @entity11 the company says it 's not a joke
but critics say it could herald the end of the *modern* internet tech bubble
