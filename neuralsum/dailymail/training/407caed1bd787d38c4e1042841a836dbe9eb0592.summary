by @entity0 tragic loss : @entity2 , the ten - year - old who collapsed and died while he was playing in the snow with his friends in february a 10 - year - old boy who collapsed in front of his pals while they played in the snow could have had a lifelong heart condition , an inquest heard			1
@entity2 had been building an igloo and throwing snowballs with friends on february 5 when he complained of feeling unwell , grabbed a tree and fell backwards to the ground			1
despite frantic attempts by his mother and a neighbour to revive him , he was pronounced dead later that day			0
an inquest into the youngster ’s death was told today that there was nothing in his post-mortem examination to explain why his heart suddenly stopped but an investigation into his medical records showed he could have suffered from an underlying heart condition since birth			1
it is not known whether he did indeed have the rare heart condition @entity31 or if it caused his death and a coroner said it would be impossible to say whether noticing the syndrome earlier would have altered the outcome			1
the hearing was told that @entity2 ’s friends ran to his home in @entity40 , @entity41 , following his collapse at around midday to tell his mum @entity44 - who ran to her only child ’s aid			1
@entity47 , the father of one of @entity2 ’s pals , dialled 999 and battled for 30 minutes to revive the unconscious boy with chest compressions , while @entity44 attempted mouth - to - mouth until the ambulance arrived			2
market stall worker @entity44 initially thought @entity2 - who had a history of epilepsy - was suffering a seizure but then realised ' it was more serious than a fit '			2
the ambulance arrived and @entity2 was taken to @entity61 but was sadly confirmed dead at 1.13pm that day			2
distraught @entity44 said in her statement : ' within minutes of getting to the hospital we were told he had n’t survived			0
' coroner @entity68 said : ' up to the moment when he suddenly collapsed @entity2 had a thoroughly good time playing with his mates in the snow			1
' @entity73 heard that @entity2 had been born with holes in his heart , which had healed , had suffered from epilepsy , asthma and was autistic			2
@entity2 was building an igloo and having a snowball fight with his friends when the tragedy struck ( file picture ) the initial post-mortem examination could n’t find a reason for @entity2 ’s death			1
@entity86 said : ' from the post-mortem there was n’t anything to explain why @entity2 collapsed and died			1
' he then added that playing in the snow and the cold air may have put a strain on his heart			2
it was when dr @entity94 , a consultant paediatrician at @entity61 , began looking at @entity2 ’s medical records , specifically an @entity96 taken when he was two - days - old , that it was noted that he may have suffered from an underlying cardiac condition known as @entity31			1
the inquest was told that it was a sudden change in the @entity96 which would only have been picked up by somebody with expertise and then brought to the attention of cardiologists			0
cardiac arrhythmic abnormalities claim the lives of eight young people each week , usually without warning			0
they come under a variety of names , including @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity31			0
essentially all describe the disruption of the electrical signals which keep the heart pumping			0
if the pattern is disrupted enough , the heart stops beating , within seconds the brain is oxygen - starved which can quickly lead to death			0
if noted @entity2 may have been subject to regular @entity120 and possibly different medication from that point			0
symptoms of the syndrome are dizziness , shortness of breath and palpitations			0
but dr @entity94 said he could n’t say if he had the syndrome at the time of his death or whether it caused his death , adding : ' i have probably never come across it as a cause of sudden death			0
' the inquest heard that it is possible to outgrow the syndrome and mr @entity68 said it was impossible to say if @entity2 suffered from it and whether knowing about the syndrome ' would have altered the outcome '			0
he passed a verdict of death by natural causes but told @entity2 ’s parents that he would include the syndrome in his verdict .			1
