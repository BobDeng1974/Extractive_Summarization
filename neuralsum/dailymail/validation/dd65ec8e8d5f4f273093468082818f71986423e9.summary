it was only fitting that a former @entity2 man should help to finally send the @entity4 title to @entity5			1
after all , this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon			2
yet it was not only a favour to his first love that @entity12 performed at @entity13			1
in scoring the crucial , confidence - building opening goal for @entity16 , he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers			1
for the @entity23 side , games against @entity20 this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture			1
three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9 - 1 aggregate			2
one more on sunday and it was an historic clean sweep			2
it would also have delayed @entity2 ’ inevitable coronation for at least another six days			2
@entity12 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after giving @entity16 the lead away to @entity20 @entity36 : @entity37 , @entity39 ( @entity38 - 45 ) , @entity40 , @entity41			1
@entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 - 78 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 - 69 ) subs not used : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 booked : @entity39 @entity56 : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity12 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( black - 75 ) ; @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 - 83 ) subs not used : @entity70 , @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 goals : @entity12 44 , @entity66 80 booked : @entity62 , @entity66 @entity12 , though , had different ideas			1
freed to attack almost at will in a new 3 - 5 - 2 formation set up by @entity78 , he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank			2
after speaking so openly on friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment , here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be			2
others in blue followed his lead			2
@entity66 scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end — when refereeing headline - magnet @entity91 ignored @entity20 ’ claims for a foul by @entity12 — but , in truth , this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick - off			1
so often in recent times , @entity16 fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area			1
@entity78 , though , turned up in @entity106 and did a number on @entity20 to secure the first triumph of his three - match reign			1
it did not go unnoticed			0
@entity66 slots home to put the game beyond doubt for @entity16 and close the gap on @entity20 ‘ @entity78 ’s blue - and - white army ’ was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down			1
@entity78 ’s hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion			0
if that is to become a reality , then he will need many more days like this one			0
overall , this was just a second win in 10 games for @entity16 but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts , with a game in hand			1
they now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play - off schedule in the fight to follow @entity2 up			0
@entity20 ’ 15 - match unbeaten run is at an end but @entity144 is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the year			1
building momentum is now @entity78 ’s ( pictured ) aim — after he recognised something different had to be attempted against @entity20 if @entity16 were not to face the inevitably of yet another defeat			1
his ploy was to move to three centre - backs , with @entity61 and @entity60 flanking captain @entity59			0
it was hardly a trio to inspire confidence in the visiting support , given their ropey individual performances this term , yet the hope was that weight of numbers would help stifle the hosts in central areas and allow @entity58 and @entity12 to advance as wing - backs			1
it worked , and contributed to a fractured opening period in which clear sights of goal were at a premium			1
@entity12 slams home the opener just before half - time to put the away side in control at @entity13 the @entity13 side had the first , thanks to a majestic , deep cross hit with pace and accuracy from the left flank by @entity183			1
@entity41 had remained upfield from an earlier free - kick but could n’t cash in on that gamble as he powered a header wide of target			0
that was , though , as good as it got for @entity20 in the first half as they encountered a @entity16 line - up displaying a renewed level of organisation			1
that such a trait was noticeable says much about what went before			0
it was n’t bringing about a huge amount in the way of free - flowing entertainment but this at least now looked more like a toe - to - toe contest between well - matched opponents			0
@entity63 set up @entity64 — back on his old stomping ground — to slice one over the top from the fringe of the penalty area			0
then @entity39 was caught out as @entity16 broke forward and was forced to haul down @entity12 around 25 yards out			1
@entity91 punished him with a yellow card before @entity63 stepped up to whip the resultant free - kick a couple of feet too high			0
a couple of set - piece exchanges then caused flickers of threat at either end			0
it would , though , be the visitors who took the lead two minutes ahead of the interval via a goal made possible by @entity78 ’s rejig			1
the move started at the feet of the oft - mocked @entity60 , who had the presence of mind to spot that @entity39 was out of position			0
a long , raking pass found @entity65 scampering into the space he had left behind			0
@entity65 stepped on the brakes to switch to his right foot and sling a cross along the six - yard line			0
@entity66 could n’t connect with a little attempted back - flick before @entity58 was denied by a terrific blocking challenge from @entity42			2
the ball broke loose and @entity12 , who had stormed into the area to support his fellow wing - back , managed to scoop a shot high into the net despite desperate attempts to close him down			2
@entity66 celebrates his goal with the fans during his side 's win it was the first time @entity16 had taken the lead against @entity20 on @entity4 duty and only the second goal they had managed during 313 minutes of this fixture			1
the question was whether they could hold onto the advantage they had finally gained			0
@entity144 sought to fix one fault in his set - up when he replaced the injured @entity39 , who had endured a pretty difficult first half , with @entity38			0
yet the pattern of play remained similar after the restart			0
it was tense , often scrappy , and with the @entity23 side winning marginally more of the numerous little battles			0
the game found fresh impetus after the hour - mark , however , as each side let slip a prime opportunity			0
it was @entity16 up first , with @entity268 feeding @entity66 , whose angled ball set up @entity65			1
he could n’t sort out his feet quick enough , allowing @entity40 to block the strike			0
seconds later , @entity272 found himself clear in the inside - right channel after the visiting defence was caught out			0
the angled shot was on , but @entity49 tried to square for sidekick @entity48 and @entity61 intercepted			0
at last , there was a stretched , open look to the game			0
@entity65 was denied space to finish at the near post after another surging run from @entity12			1
@entity20 looked to press back but saw their hopes extinguished in rancorous fashion			2
@entity12 looked to play a one - two with @entity66 , but it seemed @entity40 had beaten him to the return pass before they collided			1
the centre - back crashed to the deck claiming a foul , before @entity13 erupted in astonished fury as @entity91 waved play on			0
the rest of the home defence seemed to freeze , expecting the free - kick , but @entity66 was unperturbed as he gathered possession before cracking a shot past @entity37 .			2

@entity12 scored the opening goal for @entity16 after 44 minutes
@entity66 sealed the tie in the closing minutes with a tidy finish
@entity16 closed the gap on @entity20 to just three points in the @entity4
