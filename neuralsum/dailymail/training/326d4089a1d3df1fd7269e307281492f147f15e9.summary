a bronze sculpture by @entity2 - winning artist @entity1 unveiled outside the @entity3 on thursday was ' hijacked ' by a furious @entity5 campaigner over the weekend			2
' a @entity6 ' depicts a heavily pregnant @entity7 , 27 , and her sister @entity9 , 29 , hand - in - hand with their children @entity12 , four , and @entity13 , five - but has drawn criticism because of the lack of any adult male or father figure			1
but @entity18 , 32 , stuck photos of himself and his two young daughters @entity21 , seven , and @entity22 , 10 , onto the artwork and threw a sheet over the other mother			1
mr @entity18 , who travelled from his home in @entity41 , @entity42 , for the protest , is a member of @entity5 , which campaigns for greater rights for fathers when parents split			1
it is not associated with @entity5 or its founder @entity49			0
he said : ' they 've depicted the normal family with no fathers			1
' there 's nothing wrong with single mothers but this statue is saying one person can do both jobs , and i believe kids are always better off with both parents in their lives			1
anger : mr @entity18 , who travelled from his home in @entity41 , @entity42 , for the protest , said : ' they 've depicted the normal family with no fathers ' this is a statue that is potentially going to be around for hundreds of years and it 's not a great thing to show young people			1
' i thought i was going to get a lot of verbal abuse but people have been so supportive - especially women			0
' we engaged with hundreds of people , there were crowds of people listening to my speeches during the day			2
' it has sparked a lot of debate and a lot of women came up to me to say they were against it			0
' the people of @entity89 told me they felt they had been cheated			0
' @entity89 is such a brilliant mixed - ethnicity area and i met so many couples with children who should have been on that statue instead			2
' mr @entity18 , who is carrying out his two - day protest with fellow campaigner , @entity94 , 43 , said their actions even gained support from the statue 's commissioner			1
the hgv driver added : ' the police arrived and i thought they were n't going to let me put the pictures on but they said it was fine			1
' i told them it was just tape and i had done research about the statue material and made sure it is n't going to do any damage			2
' we only had to call the police back once when a woman tried to trip the pictures off but other than that there was no trouble			0
' a bloke came out of the library and said he was the one who commissioned it and said he was glad i had come to show my interpretation of the statue			2
' @entity122 mp @entity121 has slammed the statue , saying : ' there 's absolutely nothing wrong with single parent families but i always find it sad when fathers are not involved in the lives of their children			1
' @entity130 , from the charity @entity131 , added : ' everybody knows that families can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but this interpretation of a family seems most bizarre			2
' it is factually inaccurate and totally out of step			0
' sisters @entity7 and @entity142 and their three children were chosen from nearly 400 ' real ' families as the models for the statue			0
the campaigner said there were crowds of people listening to his speeches during the day the hgv driver said : ' the police arrived and i thought they were n't going to let me put the pictures on but they said it was fine ' he added : ' there 's nothing wrong with single mothers but this statue is saying one person can do both jobs , and i believe kids are always better off with both parents in their lives ' but at the unveiling on thursday , the pair refused to reveal details of their unique family set - up which made a panel of judges pick them as representing the city in the @entity175			1
charity outreach worker @entity9 , mother to four - year - old @entity12 , said : ' we were interested in representing women , representing single parents and also mixed race people , which are such a part of @entity89			1
' because there is n't an adult male , we thought that would be an issue and that 's why possibly we would n't be chosen			0
' @entity9 and @entity7 , mother to @entity13 , five , and eight - month - old @entity188 , were raised by their single mother @entity189 in a council house in @entity89			0
the sculpture was unveiled in @entity89 's @entity192			0
( left to right ) sculptor @entity1 , @entity142 ( 29 ) and @entity7 ( 27 ) and baby @entity193 ( eight months ) the sisters , who have two brothers @entity196 , 25 , and @entity197 , 23 , were described as ' polite and well - brought up ' by neighbours			0
@entity89 - born artist @entity1 's previous statue of a family stands in @entity202 , @entity203 , and shows a mother , father and their two children			1
her new sculpture , which was commissioned by @entity89 's @entity208 , was made in @entity209 and financed by a mixture of public money and private donations			0
miss @entity1 , who won the @entity2 in 1997 , said : ' a nuclear family is one reality but it is one of many and this work celebrates the idea that what constitutes a family should not be fixed			0

@entity18 , 32 , stuck photos of his two young daughters onto the artwork
he says ' a @entity6 ' suggests fathers are not an important part of family life
the hgv driver also gave speeches over the weekend in the city *centre*
he said : ' there 's nothing wrong with single mothers but this statue is saying one person can do both jobs '
