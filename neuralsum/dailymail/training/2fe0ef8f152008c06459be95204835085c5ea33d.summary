the number of @entity2 managers who were paid more than £ 300,000 a year has doubled in just 12 months , according to a report			1
the highly - paid executives , who often worked on an interim basis , were hired by struggling health trusts which paid them hefty salaries worth more than the prime minister ’s wage of £ 142,500			1
a report by @entity11 found that during 2013 - 14 , 44 temporary executives were paid a staggering £ 1,000 a day — the equivalent of £ 228,000 a year			1
struggling : earlier this month , officials said there have been more emergency admissions to hospitals than ever before however , the large payouts have been widely criticized by patients groups , especially as junior staff have been unable to secure a one per cent pay rise			0
according to the report , in 2013/2014 a further 22 executives received salaries of at least £ 300,000 a year			1
this salary was usually paid through an agency which allowed it a share of the money			2
yet , @entity29 have suggested that it is vitally important to offer executives high salaries to attract the right kind of employee , particularly at short notice			1

' response time : there could be a move to double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients but it took on two temporary executives , @entity65 and @entity66 , on rates of £ 387,000 a year			0
earlier this month , @entity68 uncovered a secret plan to double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients			0
the current target is for an emergency vehicle to reach those in life - threatening situations within eight minutes			0
but a document seen by the newspaper revealed that the target time to get to those suffering a range of serious problems including strokes and seizures is to be increased to 19 minutes			0
