it was , perhaps , @entity1 ’s greatest military victory – the ferocious confrontation that finally ended the tyrannical reign of @entity4			2
yet 200 years after the @entity6 , astonishingly there is still no memorial on the site to commemorate the remarkable bravery of the @entity1 troops who fought and died there – although there is a memorial to the defeated @entity13			1
now that injustice is finally about to be righted			0
a monument designed by sculptress @entity16 will be opened on the battlefield in @entity19 next year			1
victory : the memorial depicts @entity1 soldiers struggling to close the gates at @entity24 the work will feature two @entity1 soldiers and quotes from the @entity30 , who led the @entity1 forces , one reading , ‘ next to a battle lost the greatest misery is a battle gained ’ , the other saying , ‘ @entity36 was a place more fiercely assaulted nor better defended ’			1
standing just over 6ft high , the memorial commemorates the moment when a predominantly @entity1 contingent of 4,000 soldiers defended the pivotal location of @entity24 and its surroundings from a vastly superior @entity13 force			1
the lack of an official memorial for @entity1 troops has been a sore point for decades and has fuelled speculation that successive @entity1 governments and the @entity19 authorities have been reluctant to push the issue for fear of upsetting the @entity13			1
by contrast , the @entity13 have had a memorial on the site – called @entity57 – since 1904			2
a political impasse that had long delayed the construction of a @entity1 memorial was recently solved when the @entity19 authorities agreed on condition that @entity63 , the charity behind the memorial , raised the funds necessary to restore the farmhouse that was at the centre of the @entity24 fighting and turn it into a state - of - the - art visitor centre			1
the property had fallen into a state of disrepair , despite being protected under @entity19 law			2
it was perhaps @entity1 ’s greatest military victory – the ferocious confrontation that finally ended the tyrannical reign of @entity4			2
@entity77 , a painting of the action the fundraising , which is now complete , included a £ 1 million donation from the @entity82			0
both the farmhouse and the memorial will open to visitors from june			0
@entity86 , chief executive officer for @entity63 , said the memorial was to commemorate every @entity1 soldier who had fought and died at @entity6			1
‘ it is now 200 years since the @entity6 and there are monuments on the field to the @entity93 , the @entity13 , the @entity94 and the @entity95 , ’ he said			2
‘ in fact , every nation that was there is commemorated except the @entity1			0
‘ it is absolutely right that these magnificent men are commemorated and we have been very proud to have played our part			0
’ @entity24 was pivotal in the @entity6 , which took place in june 1815			0
it was almost captured by @entity4 ’s forces when a @entity13 lieutenant smashed through its @entity108 gate with an axe			0
forty @entity13 troops made it on to the site but the enemy advance was halted when a handful of @entity1 troops rushed headlong into the group to repair and close the gate			1
all the @entity13 who made it into the farm were eventually killed , with the exception of a drummer boy			0
the farmhouse ’s restoration includes a new @entity108 gate made of timber supplied from @entity126 , the @entity127 home of @entity128 , who is a descendant of @entity129 , a lieutenant involved in the brave struggle to close the breached gate at the farm .			0

200 years on , there is still no memorial on the site to commemorate the bravery of @entity1 troops who fought and died there
monument designed by @entity16 will open on the battlefield in @entity19 next year
work will feature two @entity1 soldiers and quotes from the @entity30 , who led the @entity1 forces
