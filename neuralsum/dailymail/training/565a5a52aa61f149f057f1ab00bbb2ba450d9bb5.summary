by @entity0 last updated at 4:42 pm on 25th december 2011 @entity1 looks to have missed out on its warmest ever @entity3 by just 1.3c but the weather was still balmy enough to see @entity5 break its maximum temperature record			1
an exceptionally mild @entity3 has seen weather experts monitoring their equipment with the @entity1 record for christmas day under threat			1
so far , the provisional measurements suggest that the @entity12 maximum - set in 1896 and repeated in 1920 - has not been exceeded			0
a very near miss came in @entity14 , where a provisional figure of @entity16 has been recorded , and the country enjoyed its third warmest @entity3 ever			1
red sky in the morning , @entity3 warm - ing : @entity20 brought a fiery sunrise in @entity22 , @entity23 , on a very mild @entity3 morning balmy : a family enjoy a pre-christmas walk in @entity27 , @entity28 , yesterday , as temperatures continue to stay unseasonably mild winter warmer : temperatures this month could approach the warmest for this time of year in a decade , according to forecasters while there could still be a @entity1 record today , the best window of opportunity has now passed with temperatures beginning to drop			1
however , one record did fall today as @entity5 saw its warmest ever @entity3			1
the mercury crept up to @entity40 in @entity41 , breaking the record of @entity43 which was set in 1988			0
and a year - on - year comparison makes for amazing readying , with the the same day last year offering a bone - chilling -17.5c in @entity46 - a temperature swing of @entity48 in @entity5 on the big day			1
at @entity49 in @entity50 , a temperature of 14.8 was recorded , just 0.8c below the record of @entity53 , which has stood since 1896			1
' it is a very different @entity3 to last year , ' said @entity56 forecaster @entity55			1
a runner takes advantage of the warmer temperatures in @entity27 , @entity28 , which could be the highest at @entity3 since 1997 ' this year @entity5 has seen its maximum temperature broken , while @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity50 are all close to their maximum temperature , but it looks as it they are going to fall slightly short			1
' it has been exceptionally mild in the north of the @entity1 in particular , and temperatures generally have been around the 11 and 12 mark			2
' forecasters had also predicted there would be severe winds today and they were not disappointed as gusts of 136mph were recorded in @entity73 , @entity50			0
the warm weather had dashed hopes of a @entity3 as the country woke up to gentle sunshine , with @entity23 beginning with a brilliant scarlet and orange sunrise			2
even @entity50 mountain peaks have so far escaped snowfall			0
looking forward , football fans - and fans of good weather in general - can expect some holiday sport without the usual chill , as @entity87 is also set to be a mild day			0
' after @entity87 temperatures will slowly start to fall back , returning to closer to what we 'd expect at this time of year , ' said @entity91 , a forecaster with @entity92 , the @entity93 's weather division			0
despite today 's maximum temperature not tumbling , forecasters say that the coming days will remain some of the warmest for the time of year in more than a decade – milder than @entity97 and @entity98			1
it ’s certainly very different from this time last year , when the country was in the grip of a big freeze and some areas recorded their coldest ever temperature			2
last year in @entity109 , in the @entity108 , the mercury plummeted to -18c			0
@entity110 , a forecaster for the @entity56 said : ‘ it ’s a stark contrast to last year			0
this is due to a milder air mass. ' we ’re likely to keep this general pattern through to the @entity116 and then there are likely to be some colder snaps			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity121 there were record minimum temperatures in @entity62 and @entity50			0
@entity124 time sun : nine - year - old @entity125 played in a huge field of daisies near @entity128 , @entity129 as the hot weather continued throughout june ‘ after a short cooler interlude next midweek , the set - up which has brought the current milder conditions will return , with south - westerly winds			1
’ it will continue a record - breaking year for the @entity1 which has enjoyed its warmest spring for 350 years			1
an average temperature of @entity137 or 50.58f between march 1 and may 29 beats the previous record of 1893 , when @entity140 @entity139 was on the throne and @entity142 was prime minister			2
the record - breaking hot spell was measured in central @entity61 - the triangle of land between @entity28 , @entity146 and @entity147 - and beats all previous springs since 1659			2
can you believe it 's october ? people flocked to @entity152 as temperatures across the country soared , making it the hottest october for 26 years and the country experienced a sweltering @entity157 , with october 1 declared as @entity1 ’s as most scorching october day in more than a century			2
just four weeks before the clocks went back for winter , @entity1 was in the middle of an @entity157 like no other with sizzling temperatures sweeping the country			2
meteorologists confirmed temperatures of 30c in @entity165 with @entity166 , @entity167 not far behind reaching 29.9c			0
the hottest day prior to october 's blistering heat was june 27 when highs of 33.3c were set at the @entity170 in @entity28			0
this festive family are set to be the only household in @entity1 to enjoy a white @entity3 this year - after buying a snow machine for their front garden			1
builders @entity176 , 34 , and brother @entity178 , 31 , decorated their mother 's house with £ 10,000 worth of lights including a life - size nativity scene - then topped it off with a dusting of snow			0
their £ 150 machine can pump out dozens of litres of snow at the flick of a switch , coating their garden in @entity193 , @entity147 , in a wintry blanket in minutes			0
@entity176 's sons @entity196 , 13 , and @entity197 , 11 and @entity178 's children @entity199 , six , and @entity200 , two , woke up to a white @entity3			0
