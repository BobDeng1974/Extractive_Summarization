by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 09:07 est , 1 february 2013 impostor : a @entity3 picture of the @entity5 teenager shows him wearing a medical uniform including a stethoscope a teenager who had been audaciously impersonating a doctor at two hospitals in @entity11 in echoes of the @entity14 movie ' @entity16 ' has been arrested - four months after his ruse began			1
the 17 - year - old was charged yesterday with administering a prescription drug , aggravated assault and identity theft , after he treated a 12 - year - old girl for minor injuries after a scooter accident at @entity24 on monday			1
but incredibly , it is believed he had wandering the corridors of the @entity27 in @entity11 since october , wearing scrubs , a name badge and a stethoscope , and even reading patient notes			1
and while police and hospital chiefs claimed to have known his identity all along , they said they were unable to arrest him because he had not been caught interacting directly with any patients			2
there had also been numerous sightings of him on the grounds of @entity43 in the city			2
and simply playing doctor in hospitals was not enough for the unnamed teen , who had also been seen on city streets offering first aid to the general public			0
in december the state health department circulated a situation report to some hospital staff warning them about the ' bogus clinician , ' who was expelled as a @entity57 volunteer earlier last year for inappropriate behaviour			1
the memo said the imposter , who has not been named because of his age , had been spotted on wards at the @entity5 on at least three occasions since october			1
spotted : the teen was recognised on hospital wards at the @entity27 in @entity11 wearing a name badge and a stethoscope , and even reading patient notes he was reported to be confident , versed in medical language and terminology and thus highly plausible unless pressed about his identity			1
the memo noted that he has ' not to date committed substantive offences , but should he make physical contact with a patient , posing as a clinician , this would constitute criminal assault '			2
the @entity82 first warned @entity43 about his activity in late november and the information was subsequently circulated to nursing directors and security			0
on that same day a staff member reported seeing him walking away from the hospital , wearing scrubs , an @entity43 lanyard and a stethoscope			0
charlatan : parallels are being drawn between the teen and conman @entity95 , played by @entity14 in film ' @entity16 ' the following day two more reports of possible sightings were made , one passing the level two pain clinic and one at the main entrance passing admissions			0
because the youth is under the age of 18 , he has not been named for legal reasons			0
@entity16 is a 2002 biographical crime film in which @entity14 plays @entity95 , who , before his 19th birthday , successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a pilot , a doctor , and a parish prosecutor .			0

charged with administering prescription drug , assault and identity theft
only arrested after trying to treat girl , 12 , for injuries from scooter accident
spotted on wards at @entity27 three times since october
expelled as an *ambulance* volunteer in 2011 for ' inappropriate behaviour '
