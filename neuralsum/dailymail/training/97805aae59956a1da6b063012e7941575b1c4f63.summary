a century ago it was the pioneering ' poverty ' map which charted starvation and deprivation across @entity5 and the squalor of @entity7			1
now a modern - day version of social researcher @entity10 's influential health map has painted a similar picture of sickness and disease , but with very different 21st century causes			1
while many of the poor in @entity5 100 years ago were suffering from starvation , the same areas in the capital today are rife with deadly type 2 diabetes , caused not by malnutrition but by an excess of junk food			1
startling similarities : the areas of @entity5 at high risk of diabetes in the present day map of @entity5 , left , are virtually the same as those which are most deprived in @entity10 's social map of 1889 , right mr @entity10 , a renowned @entity32 social researcher , created his famous ' poverty maps ' in the 1880s as an early form of ' social cartography ' where different colours on the streets indicated the income and class of inhabitants			1
@entity10 highlights several areas of @entity5 which are coloured black and blue , meaning @entity5 's poorest inhabitants had a ' chronic want ' and were ' vicious ' or ' semi-criminal '			1
the 21st century take on @entity10 's data highlights how disease and poverty are rife in exactly the same geographical areas			1
poverty - stricken : @entity32 families like this one in the late 19th century had to endure low life expectancy rates caused by squalor , disease and starvation hard times : while many suffered ill - health due to starvation in @entity7 ( like these children in 1860 ) modern youngsters are at risk of developing diabetes through addiction to junk food philanthropist @entity10 's pioneering social research was ahead of its time in @entity7 and eventually helped influence government action against poverty			1
a campaigner who became disillusioned with politics in the 1870s , @entity10 conducted surveys analysing the numbers of people in school and employment			0
his initial research was a precursor to his key work , ' the survey into @entity5 life and labour '			1
after criticising existing published work on poverty , @entity10 worked on the survey which would later become one of the most important documents in founding @entity85 sociology			0
as part of his research for the survey into @entity5 life and labour , @entity10 spent several weeks lodging with working class @entity5 families			2
his first map produced in 1889 documented street by street levels of poverty and wealth using coloured sections			2
the importance of his social statistics work was recognised straight away , as @entity10 was awarded the first @entity99 in @entity100 in 1882 by the @entity101			0
dr @entity103 's modern interpretation , published in the @entity104 , highlights how the same areas as in @entity10 's @entity32 map are now in the highest bracket for risk of diabetes			1
although there appears to be a correlation between @entity7 and modern - day @entity5 , the newly - researched maps do not account for various other factors which made for difficult living conditions 100 years ago			1
at the turn of the century , widespread lack of sanitation and poor diets meant pitifully low life expectancy rates			0
according to @entity122 research , the life expectancy in 1901 was just 45 for men and 48 for women			0
today , thanks to huge advances in medicine and greatly improved living conditions , men can expect to live to around 77 and women into their 80s			0
infant mortality has also plummeted since the end of the 19th century , when 140 infants died per 1000 in 1900 compared to less than 10 by the millennium			0
the areas of @entity137 where the ' lowest class or very poor ' lived are now inhabited by those with a 13.8 to 17.3 per cent chance of diabetes			0
public health expert @entity142 , from @entity143 , said : ' it was no surprise to see that diabetes risk is high in areas where poverty was high			1
' what was surprising was that some of these pockets of deprivation and ill - health have persisted for more than 100 years			1
' but unlike in @entity10 's time , we now know how diseases like diabetes can be prevented			0
using electronic records to create maps like these throughout the country could improve health and save money for the @entity162			0
' dr @entity103 's team chose to study type 2 diabetes risk because it has well - known risk factors and is preventable			2
it is strongly associated with poverty and @entity172 ethnicity , both of which are common in east @entity5 today			1
although the study examined the @entity5 boroughs of @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , the researchers say the same technique could be applied anywhere in the country , and to other diseases			2
unlike the @entity10 maps , which were based on observation , the new study uses an entire set of electronic records from @entity189 surgeries in the area			0
this very precise information means the maps are much more accurate and will be useful to individual gp surgeries			0
electronic records from more than half a million people were included in the research			0
each was assessed for risk of developing diabetes using a well - established prediction tool , known as the @entity201			2
people were categorised as ' high - risk ' if they were found to have a one in five or greater risk of developing diabetes within ten years			1
overall , about 10 per cent of the adult population fell into the high - risk category			2
but the maps showed ' hotspots ' where up to 17 per cent were at high risk			0
further analysis showed these hotspots were associated with areas of poverty			2
and these hotspots were surprisingly similar to areas of poverty highlighted in @entity10 's maps from more than a hundred years ago			1
dr @entity103 said : ' when you think of what life was like in the @entity222 in the late 1800s it 's extraordinary what the @entity162 and public health professionals have achieved , often with limited resources			0
' but there 's more still to do , and we hope this detailed information will help to reduce risk of diseases like diabetes			0

same areas of @entity5 at risk of poverty and illness 100 years on
while @entity7 suffered ill - health through starvation , modern - day map shows current *generation* put health at risk through too much junk food
