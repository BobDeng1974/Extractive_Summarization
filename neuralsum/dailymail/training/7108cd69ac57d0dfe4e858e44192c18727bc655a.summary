hospitals could start charging patients up to £ 75 - a - night for their ' bed and board ' if the health service 's looming financial crisis is not addressed , it has been claimed			1
patients could be asked to pay ' hotel costs ' if funding does not match increasing demand , the chief executive of the @entity8 warned			1
@entity13 , of the confederation which represents @entity8 commissioners and providers , said the health service would have to make ' tough choices '			1
' do we think about increasing our tolerance for longer wait ( for care ) , or do we say : " @entity8 funding is only for the health aspects of care and treatment " , which means patients being asked to cover their hotel costs for bed and board ? ' ' overall funding allocation for health and social care is a political choice			1
flat funding in real terms is a choice			2
funding that does n't match an increase in demand is a choice			0
' one - off ' lumps ' of money , which gets newspaper headlines but do n't allow health service leaders to plan effectively , are a choice			0
' he said plans to charge patients for accommodation had not been drawn up but an unnamed senior @entity8 source suggested to the newspaper that the fee could be £ 75 per night			1
however , a @entity67 spokesman denied that plans to charge for hospital stays were under consideration and said : ' the @entity8 will remain free at the point of use			1
' we know that with an ageing population there 's more pressure on the @entity8 , which is why we 've increased the budget by £ 12.7billion over this parliament and are investing in community services to keep people living healthier at home for longer			2
' the spokesman added : ' these proposals are not under consideration			0
' the @entity67 denied the proposals were under consideration and said the @entity8 would remain free it comes after a cohort of influential health bodies issued an open letter to the leaders of all three main parties stating the @entity8 was at ' breaking point '			1
the conservatives , @entity94 and @entity96 @entity95 have all focused on the @entity8 and its funding during their respective party conferences			2
@entity99 vowed to protect @entity8 budgets until 2020 , the @entity95 said they would considering adding a further £ 1billion - a - year and @entity94 pledged an extra £ 2.5billion - although it later emerged that money would not be available in their first year of government			1
the @entity105 and the @entity106 , among others , have said a funding crisis threatens the core tenet of the public health service being free at the point of access			1
they cautioned : ' savings have been made , and despite the best efforts of nurses , doctors and other staff , patients have not been insulated from these cuts			0
' too many staff feel undervalued and demoralised when all they want is to be able to care for patients			0
@entity13 ( left ) , of the confederation which represents @entity8 commissioners and providers , said hospitals could start charging for ' bed and board ' after former health minister @entity129 ( right ) previously warned that the @entity8 is ' unaffordable ' , ' out - of - date ' and unable to meet the needs of the population ' the @entity8 and our social care services are at breaking point and things can not go on like this			2
an @entity8 deficit of £ 30 billion is predicted by 2020 - a funding black hole that must be filled			1
' while we welcome the fact that the @entity8 has risen to the top of the political agenda , and some new spending commitments have been made , we need a comprehensive , fully costed , long - term spending plan if an @entity8 true to its founding principles of universal healthcare , provided according to need not ability to pay , is secured for future generations			1
' it comes after former @entity94 health minister , lord @entity129 , warned that the @entity8 was ' unaffordable ' , ' out - of - date ' and unable to meet the needs of the population			2
in july , he said everyone should pay a £ 10 - a - month fee to use the @entity8 , and he called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment			1
he said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the health service , which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing , unhealthy population			0
members of the @entity159 also called for patients to pay up to £ 10 to see their family doctor to generate vital @entity8 funding while also deterring patients from making appointments and then failing to show up , but later voted against it			1
the @entity8 's annual budget currently stands at £ 114billion , up by more than £ 12.7billion on 2010			2
but bosses claim that , once inflation is taken into account , that works out at less than a 0.1 per cent annual increase			0
the @entity8 started in july 1948 to eradicate one of the five ' giants evils ' identified by economist @entity173 - ' want , disease , squalor , ignorance , idleness '			2
health secretary @entity178 , the creator of the service , designed it to bring hospitals , pharmacists , opticians and dentists together under one organisation that would be free for all			0
charges have since been brought in for prescriptions and dental procedures but medical treatment at doctors ' surgeries and in hospitals has always been free – including overnight stays			0
from its beginning the health service has struggled to stay within budget , and the money set aside for free glasses for the organisation 's first nine months was used up in just six weeks			2
original estimates were that the service would cost taxpayers £ 140million a year by 1950 , but its budget for that year was in fact £ 358million			0
economists say the price of healthcare rises faster than the rate of inflation because of the spiraling costs of new drugs and the effects of @entity212 's aging population and growing obesity problems			0
in the last ten years , @entity8 funding has risen from around £ 1,300 per person in @entity216 to more than £ 1,979 per person			1
statistics released last year reveal the health service employs nearly 150,000 doctors , around 400,000 nurses , 150,000 scientists and more than 35,000 managers			0
last year saw a rise in the number of staff by around 18,000 , with the top performing trusts spending an extra £ 1.2billion , £ 660million more than planned			0
@entity229 had hoped to cut budgets by treating more patients in the community rather than in hospitals , but figures show emergency admissions and outpatient appointments have both risen			0
hospitals are said to be running over budget to avoid a scandal like that at @entity241 , where police investigated more than 300 deaths said to be due neglect or poor care .			0

senior @entity8 source claims suggested fee could be set at about £ 75 per night
chief executive of @entity8 said ' tough choices ' would be made
but @entity67 said : ' the @entity8 will remain free at the point of use '
three main parties have all promised to protect funding or boost budgets
but *experts* say a funding crisis threatens the principle of free healthcare
