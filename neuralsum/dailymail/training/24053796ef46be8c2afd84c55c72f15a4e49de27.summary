a @entity5 doctor , @entity4 , boasted about feeding his family roadkill			2
he said he had created dishes such as badget balti and tenderloin of wild venison however , one ’s appetite for them might be tempered by the fact that the meat for both was provided by dead animals left on the road			1

the consultant in acute medicine and renal failure serves his ‘ free , ethical , ’ food to his three children as well as dinner party guests			2
mr @entity4 began his culinary adventure by taking home a dead badger			1
his children – aged nine , seven and four – looked on as he butchered the male animal and made it into a curry , despite the fact that his wife @entity53 is a strict vegetarian			1
he said of the process : ‘ the effort required to produce edible flesh from roadkill is considerable , and skinning an old boar badger demands a technique akin to chiselling			2
‘ for some days , thick black bristles were still turning up on the kitchen surfaces – much to the fury of my vegetarian wife			2
‘ i opted to serve the badger in a curry sauce , persuading myself that no dangerous microbes could survive seven hours of slow casseroling with a ton of spices			0
’ he went on to say : ‘ in truth , the flesh resembled some dodgy meat substitute from a long - expired @entity75 ration pack , and despite the lengthy cooking it remained tooth - breakingly tough			0
' all seven guests at our roadkill initiation evening tried the main course – eventually – although only two came back for seconds			2
‘ our curried badger might not have been the best dish ever served at a dinner party , but it was certainly the most talked about			0
’ ‘ our curried badger might not have been the best dish ever served at a dinner party , but it was certainly the most talked about , surgeon @entity4 said of his recipe mr @entity4 , who works at @entity88 in @entity5 , @entity89 , and lives on @entity90 , revealed that he now regularly eats deer he finds on the side of the road , even offering bottles of wine to colleagues who tip him off about the presence of a carcass			1
he believes that roadkill has improved his diet , saved him money and is helping to broaden his children ’s minds			0
mr @entity4 added : ‘ a deer carcass provides around £ 300 worth of prime meat , and distributing this among friends results in plenty of return dinner invitations			1
‘ roadkill venison is also an ethical food and a number of usually vegetarian friends have eschewed their principles on occasion because they are happy to eat meat obtained in this way			2
’ while picking up roadkill is not illegal in @entity120 , it is illegal to take home an animal if you have knocked it down yourself			0

police warn that eating roadkill can cause poisoning however @entity89 and @entity131 said motorists could be putting their health at risk by eating their roadside finds			1
wildlife officer sergeant @entity136 said police are frequently called out to collisions between cars and deer and the resulting meat would not be suitable to eat			0
he explained : ‘ you may have driven down that road an hour before and returned to find the carcass of a deer , but sometimes police and a vet have already been and gone and such a find would not in any way be fit for human consumption			0
‘ there are occasions where a zoo or educational organisation has come out to remove an already deceased carcass			0
‘ however i would strongly urge people to be cautious			0
make sure that you know the absolute full history of the death of an animal before you think about taking it home , cooking and eating it			0
’ he added : ‘ please do not just assume that it died as a result of being struck by a vehicle			0
