@entity0 in action for @entity11 on day two of the three - day match against @entity26 @entity0 ( centre ) pictured with his @entity11 team - mates at @entity8 on monday @entity14 is hoping @entity0 can further his quest when @entity11 face @entity30 in their first @entity32 fixture next week - while @entity18 insists @entity3 's selectors need to clarify with a ' very public decision ' once and for all whether the controversial @entity36 - born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again			1
@entity0 's impressive return to long - form cricket 14 months after his @entity3 sacking was timely , on the eve of the first test against the @entity44 which began 4,000 miles away in @entity45 on monday			1
@entity14 said : ' anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors			1
' @entity0 should n't look any further than the next innings , whether it 's here or down at @entity53			2
' if he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds , double - hundreds , help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to			0
' no one has got any idea whether @entity0 will play for @entity3 again			1
' the only people that know that are those who are currently picking the @entity3 side			2
' at the moment he 's not being considered , because he has n't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months			0
' @entity0 chills out against the fence as @entity26 bat on monday @entity14 ( right ) believes that @entity0 could make it difficult for the @entity3 selectors @entity18 is impressed that @entity0 has already proved he is serious about a recall , and he is adamant the @entity74 must ' watch out ' for him			1
' he could easily go off and get his @entity76 contract and play over there , ' @entity18 said on @entity78			0
' he 's decided to give it another go ... people say ' oh , 170 against @entity83 - it was only @entity83 '			1
' but as a player who has played @entity85 matches to turn up at the @entity86 and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so i 'd watch out , if i was a selector			0
' @entity18 senses @entity0 will not be easily deterred , unless @entity3 spell out that they do not want him			1
' this is not a lad that 's going to go away , and the @entity74 need to make a decision on @entity0 - make a very public decision on him , whether he is available for selection or not , ' he said			2
' i know the chairman elect , @entity96 , has said that he is			0
' but it needs to come from the selectors			0
' @entity0 believes last week 's departure of @entity101 - the @entity74 managing director who described him as ' disengaged ' - has offered him an @entity3 ' lifeline ' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record - breaking career			1
@entity14 , who played for @entity3 until the age of 40 , added : ' whether you 're 18 or 38 , if you 're good enough , then i believe you take the age factor out of the occasion			2
' if you 're performing , surely you 've got to be warranting a place in the team			0
' @entity0 made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in @entity83 on sunday @entity0 fielding on monday afternoon as the 34 - year - old makes his county cricket return he hopes @entity0 can boost @entity11 's championship promotion prospects , and was encouraged by his comeback			1
' it was a very good innings , ' @entity14 added			0
' he had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up , letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is , which we all know but we just have n't seen it because he 's only played 20 - over cricket			0
' we 've signed @entity0 because he 's a top - class player			2
' will he play for @entity3 ? we do n't know			0
