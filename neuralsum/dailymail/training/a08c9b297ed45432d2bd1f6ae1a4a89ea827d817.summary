by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 7 may 2013 a schoolboy is to make his debut in a @entity4 film , but he need n't worry if his acting skills are a little rigid - he will appear as a fibreglass figure of a boy soldier			1
artist @entity8 created his life - size boy soldier with grenade and tin helmet using moulds taken of his nephew @entity13 when he was aged seven			1
now aged 11 , @entity13 is set to see his arty incarnation star on the big screen with the sculpture set to feature in @entity17 2 which will be released later this summer			1
art imitates life : @entity20 pictured with a cast taken of him when he was aged seven , ( left ) and the finished boy soldier sculpture by his artist uncle @entity8 the striking figure had already proved a hit with actor @entity27 requesting his own personal copy of the artwork after working on a film with @entity8 and @entity31 front man @entity32 also owning a version			1
@entity8 , 33 , who has been working in the film industry since he was 15 , spent a painstaking two months taking the moulds of @entity13 's arms , legs , torso and head before assembling the figure			1
taking accurate moulds of the seven year old was a tricky task as @entity13 had to sit completely still , particularly for the facial mould			0
but according to @entity8 , from @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity13 was the model professional throughout the work			2
talented : artist @entity8 , who created the boy soldier sculpture from a life cast of his nephew @entity13 he said : ' my brother was kind enough to let me borrow @entity13 for these models and he was great			1
' when i was taking a mould of the face he had to be so still and he kept the same facial expression the whole time			0
' @entity13 was a bit indifferent about doing it at first			0
i think he would prefer to be out playing football or something			0
' the art work itself has done really well but i do n’t quite make enough to live on just yet			0
' versions of the boy soldier usually fetch around £ 7,000 a time			1
@entity8 found his way into the film industry following in his father @entity68 's footsteps - he worked at @entity70 when @entity8 was growing up			2
on visits to the studio with his father , @entity8 found his way on to such film sets as @entity75 : the @entity76 and star wars : @entity78			2
now , @entity8 , @entity68 and brother @entity79 , the family firm			0
@entity8 's own work , mainly in special effects , make up and prosthetics , has seen him work on films such as @entity85 , @entity86 , the @entity88 films and @entity89			2
his focus shifted slightly from the world of film to the art world when a friend suggested he exhibit some of his work			0
he said : ' i have been doing mould making and special effects work since i was 15 because that is what my @entity100 has always done			0
' i had begun to construct models similar to these for work but then about three years ago one of my friends said i should put it up in her art show so i did			0
' some of @entity8 's work was featured on a plinth in @entity110 in 2011			2
keeping still : @entity20 pictured while casts are taken , left , for one of the boy soldier sculptures ( right ) made by @entity115 ' @entity8 hitting the big screen : the artwork will feature @entity118 starring @entity119 as @entity120			1
