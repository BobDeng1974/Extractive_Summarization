four men were yesterday sentenced to death by hanging for the gang rape and murder of a student on a @entity6 bus			1
an @entity8 court ruled the men should go to the gallows for the attack which left the 23 - year - old woman with such severe internal injuries she died two weeks later			1
the judge said the ultimate punishment was needed as a ‘ strong deterrent ’ after a case that ‘ shocked the conscience ’ of a nation			2
after the death penalty was announced , the wail of one of the four killers , 20 - year - old @entity29 , filled the tiny courtroom in @entity6			1
@entity29 , an assistant at a gym , then broke down in sobs and was dragged out of the court , where police with riot gear had formed a barricade to keep crowds back			0
the sentences were welcomed by the victim ’s family and scores of people outside the court building in @entity6 , who chanted ‘ justice , justice ’ , as news of the punishment was relayed to them			1
even children were seen holding drawings and placards of the men being hung by a noose			2
but legal experts warned it could be years before the four men exhaust the appeal process and are hanged			1
some even doubt whether the men will ever be executed , as the vast majority of death penalties are commuted to life in prison			1
@entity8 ’s @entity81 has ruled the death penalty should be used only in ‘ the rarest of rare cases ’			1
although more than 100 people are sentenced to death in @entity8 in most years , only two people – both terrorists – have been executed in the country since 2004			2
@entity8 is thought to have carried out around 50 executions since independence in 1947 , although there are 477 people on death row			2
supporters : demonstrators hold a placard outside a court in @entity6 as her killers are sentenced to death the sentencing was the climax of a seven - month trial , often held behind closed doors , that was punctuated dramatically by a fifth defendant , aged 33 , hanging himself in his jail cell			1
a sixth , who was under 18 at the time of the attack , was earlier sentenced to three years detention , the maximum allowed under juvenile law			0
prosecutors had called for the ‘ harshest punishment ’ to be given to @entity29 , bus cleaner @entity115 , 28 , fruit - seller @entity23 , 19 , and unemployed @entity118 , in his early 20s , to signal that such attacks can not be tolerated			2
the victim , who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus , became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country where a rape is reported on average every 21 minutes and cases of molestation are common			2
the woman , who came from a lower - middle class family and worked in a call centre while she studied , can not be named for legal reasons , but @entity8 media have dubbed her @entity136 , a @entity138 word meaning fearless			0
the defendants lived on the bottom rungs of @entity8 ’s booming economy			0
nearly all came from families that had moved to @entity6 in recent years from desperately poor villages , hoping to find jobs in the capital			1
judge @entity148 said : ‘ these are the times when gruesome crimes against women have become rampant , and courts can not turn a blind eye to the need to send a strong deterrent message to the perpetrators of such crimes			0
’ demanding justice : demonstrators have come out in force since the horrific fatal gang rape in december of a student on a bus			1
four men have been sentenced to death , but their punishment has done little to act as a deterrence for the rapist of a four - year - old on a bus near @entity171 the victim ’s mother , who can not be named under @entity8 laws guarding her daughter ’s identity even after death , said : ‘ today we can breathe a little easier			1
i hope the conviction will deter people from committing such crimes in future			0
’ defence lawyers had urged the court to ignore what they said was popular and political pressure for the harshest penalty			0
' this is not the victory of truth			0
but it is the defeat of justice , ' defence lawyer @entity190 shouted at the judge when the sentence was read out			2
' the judge has taken the decision under political pressure without considering facts , ' he told reporters later			0
joyous : cheers went up outside the @entity6 court when lawyers rushed out to announce the death sentence the country 's interior minister , @entity204 , denied that there had been any political interference , telling a tv news channel : ' no judicial authority can be influenced by the government			1
' the sentencing capped a seven - month trial , often held behind closed doors , that was punctuated dramatically by a fifth defendant hanging himself in his jail cell			0
a sixth , who was under 18 at the time of the attack , was earlier sentenced to three years detention , the maximum allowed under juvenile law			0
in november , @entity8 ended what many human rights groups had interpreted as an undeclared moratorium on capital punishment when it executed a man convicted for the 2008 militant attack on the city of @entity171			0
three months later , it hanged a @entity231 separatist for a 2001 militant attack on parliament			0
' in the past year , @entity8 has made a full - scale retreat from its previous principled rejection of the death penalty , ' said @entity237 , @entity238 director of @entity239			1
prosecutors had called for the ' harshest punishment ' to be given to @entity29 , bus cleaner @entity242 , fruit - seller @entity23 , and unemployed @entity118 for last december 's murder to signal that such attacks can not be tolerated			2
the four men were found guilty of luring the woman onto a bus , raping and torturing her with a metal bar and then throwing her naked and bleeding onto the road			2
she died two weeks later			0
delighted : a prosecution lawyer displays a victory sign as he speaks to journalists after the sentencing ' everybody got the death penalty ' : defense lawyer @entity259 ( centre ) speaks to the media after the case violent protests exploded in several cities after the crime , a reaction commentators and sociologists said reflected a deep well of frustration that many urban @entity8 feel over what they see as weak governance and poor leadership on social issues			1
the government , seen as out of touch with the aspirations of the burgeoning urban middle class , was caught off guard by the protests			0
the case led to the introduction of tougher rape laws in march , and for the first time open conversation about gender crime in television debates , social media and even @entity287			0
still , sex crimes remain commonplace in @entity8 , and social commentators say patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a decade of rapid economic growth			0
awaiting their fate : four men convicted of raping and murdering a female student on a @entity6 bus are transported in a police vehicle to court , where they were each handed the death penalty on death row : the men were ordered to the gallows over the brutal attack in december that triggered angry protests and widespread calls for the execution of her attackers comments on social media websites and elsewhere ahead of the sentencing suggested that popular opinion favoured executing the men , although a survey by @entity318 - the @entity317 newspaper in july showed @entity8 were divided on the merits of capital punishment			1
although the @entity81 ruled in the 1980s that the death penalty should be imposed only in the ' rarest of rare ' cases , opponents say the reality is quite different			1
@entity8 courts sentenced 1,455 prisoners to death between 2001 and 2011 , according to the @entity328			0
there are 477 people on death row			0
many have been there for years			0
horrific : the woman , a 23 - year - old trainee physiotherapist , and a male friend were lured onto a bus by five men and a teenager then repeatedly raped and tortured no mercy : people stand in a queue for a security check outside the court , where the judge rejected pleas by the defendants for a lighter sentence human rights groups have been alarmed , however , by the vigour with which president @entity351 , who took office in july 2012 , has acted in clearing the backlog of clemency pleas			1
he has rejected 11 , confirming the death penalty for 17 people			1
some women 's rights groups and legal experts had opposed executing the @entity6 attackers			2
others have invoked the @entity362 principle that ' an @entity363 makes the whole world blind '			0
' sending these four men to the gallows will accomplish nothing except short - term revenge , ' @entity365 , director of @entity366 said in a statement			2
' while the widespread anger over this case is understandable , authorities must avoid using the death penalty as a ' quick - fix ' solution			1
there is no evidence that the death penalty is a particular deterrent to crime , and its use will not eradicate violence against women in @entity8			1

student , 23 , died after being gang - raped by six men on bus in @entity6
judge rejects pleas for lighter sentence after public calls for death penalty
ruling needs to be ratified by the @entity396 and appeals could take years
