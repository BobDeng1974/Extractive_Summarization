@entity1 champions @entity0 still owe £ 84m in unpaid tax according to the latest figures released by @entity1 ’s football league ( @entity4 )			1
clubs in @entity1 have worked hard at driving down their tax debt and @entity0 are sticking to a repayment scheme that has seen the sum they owe halved in the last two years			2
but their debt remains at £ 84m and the total owed for @entity1 ’s top two divisions is still a staggering £ 339m			2
@entity13 and @entity14 , along with @entity15 and @entity16 , both enjoy a different tax status to the rest of the clubs in @entity1 and as part of that deal there is no public record of their fiscal situation though both big clubs are understood to be debt free			1
@entity0 are still £ 84m in debt despite their @entity29 triumph , according to latest @entity4 figures many clubs in @entity32 believe there has been various state assistance with @entity14 and @entity13 the figure from @entity0 will upset many clubs in @entity32 who feel @entity1 clubs have been propped up by various state assistance in recent years with @entity14 and @entity0 ’s tax status and a land deal between @entity0 council and @entity13 currently being investigated by the @entity43			1
other clubs will see this as further evidence that @entity29 continues to be ripe for asset stripping with @entity0 ’s need to sell players every summer not likely to be changing in the near future			0
the overall situation of clubs in @entity1 with those in the first division owing £ 237m and those in division two owing 178m goes a long way to explaining the exodus of talent from @entity29 in recent seasons with clubs outside of the top two no longer able to hold on to their best players			0
@entity0 have had to sell several key players every summer , including @entity65 who joined @entity66 @entity67 won @entity29 in 2000 ( @entity68 pictured ) but are second in the table of debts the @entity4 figures also show 13 clubs in the process of administration as they reduce their debts			0
@entity67 , who won the league in 2000 , and the city of @entity14 ’s second club , @entity79 , come in second and third in the league of shame			2
@entity67 , who are in administration , owe £ 50m and @entity79 owe £ 35m , while @entity0 - based clubs @entity85 and @entity87 come in fifth and seventh in the table with debts of £ 27m and £ 11m respectively			1
in a determined effort to drive down debt in @entity1 @entity4 president @entity92 has vowed to stop clubs with unsustainable debts competing in the league			0
overall debt has been reduced from £ 475m euros to £ 379m in the last year although this @entity4 figure is disputed by @entity1 ’s @entity97 who argue the figure remains closer to £ 445m .			0

@entity0 still owe £ 84m in unpaid tax according to latest figures
