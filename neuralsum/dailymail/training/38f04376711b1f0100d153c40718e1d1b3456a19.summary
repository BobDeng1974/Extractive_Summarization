by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 31 march 2013 @entity1 has made an official complaint over police leaks as they have run a ' dishonest and illicit ' campaign to destroy him the cabinet minister forced to step down over the ‘ plebgate ’ affair has accused police of a sustained ‘ dishonest and illicit ’ campaign to destroy him			1
former chief whip @entity1 launched the attack after a press report suggested an official @entity16 inquiry has dismissed his claim that police lied about being insulted by him			1
he accused @entity16 of leaking the information in an attempt to clear @entity22 police , who claimed he called them ‘ f * * * * * * plebs			1
’ in a letter to @entity27 , deputy chairman of the @entity28 , he said : ‘ i would like to lodge an official complaint to the @entity28			1
’ he added : ‘ this was an enquiry into a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career			1
' it would appear that this police enquiry continues precisely that process			2
i am deeply dismayed that the @entity40 appear to have leaked part of their report prepared for the @entity43			0
and spun it to the advantage of the police officers involved			2
’ mr @entity1 ’s response came after press reports that @entity16 ’s inquiry into the row found no conclusive evidence that @entity22 police lied or tried to frame him			1
mr @entity1 has apologised for using bad language when asked to take his bicycle via a side entrance at the @entity22 gates last september			2
but he has always claimed that police fabricated claims that he called them ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’			1
it led to his resignation as chief whip after it was leaked to the press			1
but the row flared again last week when the @entity40 sent the results of a three - month investigation into the affair to the @entity43			0
the former chief whip has written to @entity27 , deputy chairman of the @entity28			1
he argues that the police attempted to destroy his career it is understood to conclude there is no proof of a conspiracy by the officers to smear or destroy mr @entity1 ’s career			1
the saga took another turn when , hours after receiving the @entity40 ’s file , the @entity43 said it was unhappy with the quality and quantity of the evidence			0
weeks after being forced to resign in disgrace , mr @entity1 became convinced that he was the victim of a police conspiracy after new evidence appeared to cast doubt on the claims against him			2
about 30 detectives have taken statements from all 800 officers in the diplomatic protection group as part of @entity93 , the codename for @entity16 ’s ‘ plebgate ’ investigation			2
however , it is understood that @entity93 has found no evidence to corroborate @entity99 mp mr @entity1 ’s allegation			0
he has always claimed that police fabricated claims that he called them ' f * * * * * * plebs ' when he was asked to use a different entrance last year ( pictured ) former shadow home secretary @entity104 , a close ally of mr @entity1 , said last night : ‘ it is not for members of the @entity40 to decide on their own case , and it is certainly not for them to attempt to spin themselves out of trouble			1
’ criticism : @entity111 said the @entity40 police should not have investigated its own officers former @entity115 leader @entity114 said : ‘ i am concerned about the leaked report			1
‘ it should not have put into the public domain			0
if leaked by the police – and there are indications that this is the case – it is utterly deplorable			0
’ @entity111 , @entity124 chairman of the @entity126 home affairs committee , said the latest development showed it was wrong for @entity16 to lead the inquiry into its own officers			0
he called for the whole investigation to be taken over by the @entity28			2
@entity16 is trying to discover how two national newspapers obtained information about the ' @entity133 ' row and if it came from police			0
it is also looking at a police officer 's claim to have witnessed the altercation and allegations by mr @entity1 that police had lied in a log of the event			0
three officers from the @entity143 have so far been arrested as part of the investigation			0
papers related to the case were passed to prosecutors on thursday , but the @entity43 said it was not ' a full file of evidence ' and more is expected			0
" we now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges , " it said in what was seen as a rebuke to the force .			0
