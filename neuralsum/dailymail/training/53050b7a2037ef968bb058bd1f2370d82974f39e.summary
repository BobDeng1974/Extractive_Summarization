chemicals in make - up , perfume and plastic containers could be behind a surge in the incidence of asthma in children , researchers warned yesterday			1
scientists have found that babies exposed to high levels of phthalates while in the womb are up to 78 per cent more at risk of the condition			1

asthma rates in children in the @entity37 have increased by between two and three times since the 1950s and a similar trend has been noticed in other @entity41 countries			2
researchers at the @entity43 in @entity44 measured the level of two types of phthalates – butylbenzyl and di - n - butyl – in the urine of 300 pregnant women			2
the mothers were then given questionnaires when their children were aged five , six , seven , nine and 11 to determine if they had asthma symptoms			0
the study , published in the journal @entity58 , found that children born to women with the highest levels of butylbenzyl phthalate were 72 per cent more likely to develop asthma			2

avoid using plastic containers and as much as you can store your food in glass jars in the fridge ' those with the highest levels of di - n - butyl phthalate were 78 per cent more at risk compared to women with low levels			1
dr @entity78 , of @entity43 , said : ‘ these chemicals are very widely used in very high volume and they are not generally listed on labels			0

dr @entity106 , director of research and policy at the charity @entity37 , said : ‘ it is a complex condition and these new research findings need to be explored in much more detail			0
