@entity0 and @entity2 super-middleweight champion @entity1 has revealed he is close to agreeing a dream fight with @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity1 has sought a meeting with @entity7 since stopping @entity8 for the first time in november 2013 and is now confident promoter @entity10 will deliver the fight			1
@entity1 celebrates after defending his @entity0 and @entity2 super-middleweight titles at @entity13 last may it had been rumoured @entity1 would look to get his revenge on @entity16 after his points defeat when the duo met in 2011 , but the @entity20 fighter , 37 , is only interested in a @entity22 frenzy			1
‘ professional boxing is a business first and foremost , let ’s not forget that , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ people talk about @entity16 , but i do n’t want to fight him , he ’ll probably beat me on points			1
‘ i ’m a fighter and if i did n’t knock him out he ’d beat me on points			0
@entity30 celebrates his victory over @entity32 in @entity33 in september ‘ he ’s not a big fight			1
@entity36 tv do n’t want to show him on @entity22			0
so what ’s the point ? ’ @entity1 hopes the @entity7 fight will take place in march and insists plans beyond that will be dictated by his performance against the @entity44			1
‘ dare i say it , but we ’re nearly there with the @entity7 fight in @entity5 which we ’ve long talked about , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ after knocking out @entity8 i was talking about the @entity7 fight happening			0
it ’s nearly there and i ’m very optimistic that @entity10 will make an announcement very soon			2
‘ this fight will take me to @entity5			1
between beating @entity53 and speaking about @entity7 , i ’ve had the two epic fights with @entity8			0
@entity1 ( left ) floors @entity8 during the super-middleweight bout at @entity13 last year ‘ last year was a great year for me			2
but definitely my next fight is in @entity5			2
’ ' i 've talked about retiring since i fought @entity59 when everybody though i was going to get beaten			0
' i would have retired had i lost that fight , but since winning it i 've gone from strength to strength			0
' here i am in 2015 talking about a dream fight in @entity5			2
hopefully i 'm getting that fight with march being talked about			0
' if i beat @entity7 on style and i feel great doing it , why would i retire at 37 years old ? i 'm not 47 , i 'm 37 and still feeling fresh and fit			0
as long as i can still do what i need to do physically , then i 'll continue to box			0
' it 's one fight at a time , which is the way i 've approached it for the last couple of years			2
@entity7 next and then who knows ? ' @entity76 is looking really good			0
i 'm impressed with what he 's doing			0
he 's improved so much			0
that 's a massive fight in @entity81			0
' since losing to @entity16 in december 2011 , @entity1 has posted impressive wins against @entity59 , @entity83 , @entity53 and @entity8 - his bitter domestic rival who failed to go beyond nine rounds in their two contests			1
@entity16 is the division 's undisputed number one but his career has stalled due to promotional issues and injuries that have rendered him inactive for the past 14 months , while the @entity36 's spoiling style also makes him a less attractive opponent			2
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity76 ringside as they wait for an interview at the @entity97 last july @entity7 , the 28 - year - old former @entity98 middleweight champion and son of all - time great @entity7 , is a more aggressive fighter who has a record of 48 victories from 51 outings , although he has experienced weight and disciplinary problems in the past			2
' it 's an intriguing fight , because you ca n't say either myself of @entity7 will win , ' @entity1 said			1
' i 've improved since the @entity16 fight , had a great win over @entity53 and almost found the second @entity111 fight easy - it was n't hard work			1
when i 'm producing that , why would people doubt me against @entity7 ? ' @entity7 is a great fighter and in this weight division he 'll be more comfortable			0
the fight carries its question marks - will he be good enough at super-middle ? have i still got what it takes to go 12 rounds because @entity7 is very tough ? ' @entity30 ( right ) lands a right hand to the head of @entity124 during their fight in @entity33 last september			1

@entity1 says *negotiations* over a fight with @entity30 are close to *completion*
claims he does n't want to fight @entity16 because he 's ' not a big fight '
@entity1 is confident that promoter @entity10 will deliver his big money - *spinning* @entity5 bout
