before president @entity2 got off the plane in @entity4 on monday , @entity1 military officials directed an honor guard to fall in line - literally			1
two men were photographed holding a string in front of the guardsmen , to see if they were standing together in a perfectly straight line			1
@entity2 traveled to @entity1 in order to attend the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) summit			1
with his influence at home quickly fading , president @entity2 is looking east to @entity1 , the opening stop of a three - country tour that will test his ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office			1
this is n't the first time string tests have been employed before welcoming ceremonies : @entity29 has snapped guards being subject to the tests multiple times , including before the arrivals of @entity38 - the president of @entity40 - in june 2013 , @entity32 - the president of @entity34 - in august 2013 , and @entity36 - the chancellor of germany - in august 2014			1
get in line : members of a @entity1 guard of honor prepare for the arrival of @entity46 president @entity2 ahead of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) summit in @entity4 on monday ceremony : the honor guard was at the airport before the president 's arrival all together now : the guardsmen were seen in perfectly straight lines on monday greetings : the @entity1 guardsmen form perfect lines waiting for @entity2 to step off the plane once treated like a global superstar , @entity2 arrived monday in @entity4 under far different circumstances , with his most powerful days behind him			1
at home , @entity61 are still rejoicing at having pummeled @entity2 's political party in the midterm elections , relegating democrats to the minority in both chambers of @entity68			2
his counterparts in @entity70 surely have noticed			0
upon his arrival in the @entity1 capital , @entity2 stepped off @entity73 and onto a red carpet , where the honor guard lined his path to a waiting limousine			1
first up was a sit - down with president @entity80 of @entity81 , where @entity2 lived as a child			2
@entity80 , who was sworn in last month amid high hopes for progressive leadership , said his election showed @entity86 and democracy can go together , and pledged to keep fighting extremism in his country			0
@entity2 was effusive , calling his election an ' affirmation of the full transition @entity81 has made to a thriving democracy and a model for the kind of tolerance and pluralism that we want to see all around the world			2
' @entity2 suggested @entity99 might even visit @entity100 next year			2
reviving a phrase from his youth , @entity2 thanked the assembled reporters in @entity81 , the country 's official language			2
arriving in style : @entity2 stepped off @entity73 and onto a red carpet , where the honor guard lined his path to a waiting limousine lame duck ? @entity1 is the opening stop of @entity2 's three - country tour that will test the president 's ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office later monday , @entity2 was to give a speech monday about @entity46 ties to @entity70 at a high - level @entity14 summit , then join key @entity70 leaders for dinner and fireworks at the @entity127			1
during his three days in @entity1 , @entity2 will also meet with @entity1 president @entity128			1
the leaders of the world 's two largest economies will address reporters before the state visit draws to a close wednesday and @entity2 flies to @entity135			1
the trip marks one of @entity2 's final opportunities to deliver on his goal to amplify @entity46 influence in @entity70			2
in @entity1 , @entity135 and @entity142 , leaders will be rendering judgment on whether @entity2 's lofty ambitions in @entity145 have been sidetracked by festering crises in @entity147 , @entity148 and the @entity149			1
' this is going to be a tough trip for the president , ' said @entity153 , an @entity70 expert at the @entity154 in @entity100			0
he said @entity70 leaders were viewing @entity2 's trip with a key question in mind : who is @entity2 after the midterm elections ? ' they 'll be trying to discern whether he has the commitment and political capital to follow through , ' @entity161 said			2
even before the election , @entity2 's commitment to the region and his ability to boost @entity46 clout there was in doubt in many capitals			0
@entity46 allies such as @entity174 and @entity175 have pressed for a greater @entity46 presence , partly to counter @entity1 's growing influence			0
yet @entity2 's mission against the @entity180 group and his government 's ebola response have diverted @entity46 military and financial resources elsewhere			0
' the president remains deeply committed to his @entity70 rebalancing strategy , and its implementation will remain a top priority throughout the second term , ' said @entity2 's national security adviser , @entity191			0
not the first time : guards were subject to a string test before @entity32 of @entity34 arrived in august 2013 prepared : the guards also fell under a string test in july before @entity36 , the chancellor of germany , arrived in @entity4 @entity46 presidents often immerse themselves in foreign affairs during their last years in office , when the focus on the next presidential race saps the energy from their own domestic efforts			1
in the wake of last week 's elections , @entity205 officials spoke optimistically about @entity2 's prospects for clinching trade deals in @entity70 and elsewhere now that @entity61 are set to control @entity68			0
under @entity2 , @entity46 trade negotiators for years have been pursuing the @entity211 , a major trade pact being negotiated with 11 nations			0
the talks have repeatedly blown past their deadlines , and other nations have been wary about @entity2 's ability to push an eventual deal through @entity68 , where @entity219 have been sensitive to the concerns of labor unions			0
but with @entity61 in charge , @entity2 's prospects may have improved , so the argument goes			0
@entity61 tend to support trade deals as a way to boost the @entity46 economy , and @entity61 leaders have spoken positively about giving @entity2 so - called " fast track " approval that would subject the final deal to an up - or - down vote , preventing last - minute amendments that could sink the whole deal			1
@entity1 's not part of the talks , and is pursuing its own free trade deals in the region			0
what 's more , @entity1 leaders have viewed @entity2 's focus on @entity70 with suspicion , fearing an attempt to contain @entity1 's growth and influence in the region			1
in a sign of the political climate facing @entity2 in @entity1 , state - run media have been mocking him in the days before his visit			1
' @entity2 always utters " yes , we can , " which led to the high expectations people had for him , ' read an editorial in the english - language @entity250			0
' but he has done an insipid job , offering nearly nothing to his supporters			0
@entity46 society has grown tired of his banality			0
' another reminder of the tensions in the region came hours before @entity2 left on saturday when @entity264 released two @entity46 detainees after @entity2 's spy chief made a secret mission to @entity268 to secure their release			0
in his meetings with @entity128 , @entity2 also plans to address human rights issues , officials said , including the treatment of journalists as well as pro-democracy protests in @entity276 that erupted in september to the dismay of @entity1 officials			2
climate change - a key concern in smog - filled @entity4 - and @entity1 's aggressive behavior toward its neighbors are also on @entity2 's agenda .			1
