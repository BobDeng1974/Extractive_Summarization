by @entity0 a leaping frog made an appearance at @entity4 ’s launch of the @entity6 spacecraft last week			1
the adventurous amphibian was spotted jumping up in the air as the spacecraft took off from the @entity11 launchpad on its mission to the moon			1
it is not yet known whether the frog wanted to hitch a ride , get its 15 minutes of fame , or was in the wrong place at the wrong time			2
a @entity4 spokesperson said : ‘ the photo team confirms the frog is real and was captured in a single frame by one of the remote cameras used to photograph the launch			1
‘ the condition of the frog , however , is uncertain			2
’ an @entity44 rocket , built by @entity45 , provided the ride from @entity48 s @entity47 what @entity51 the bat 's thoughts were when he settled on the space shuttle @entity52 will never be known but it is probably safe to assume that being blasted into space at 17,500mph was not among them			0
in 2009 , the free - tailed bat stowaway had latched himself onto the shuttle 's external fuel tank several hours before countdown			0
every now and then he shifted position			0
@entity51 was seen still attached to mission @entity62 as it cleared the tower and accelerated to 17,500mph in eight minutes			0
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , pronounced ' @entity65 ' - dee , ' is taking a roundabout path to the moon , making three huge laps around @entity69 before getting close enough to go into lunar orbit			1
an @entity44 rocket , built by @entity45 , provided the ride from @entity4 ’s @entity47			1
this is n’t the first time an animal has photo bombed a space launch			0
in 2009 , @entity51 the bat clung to the side of the space shuttle as it blasted into space at 17,500mph			0
@entity6 , which is the size of a small car , is expected to reach the moon on october 6 .			2
