heiress @entity11 , dubbed the @entity12 , has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with three of her four children , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , over the family fortune left by her father , mining magnate @entity19			1
@entity22 - based ms @entity11 , 57 , tried to get details of the rift suppressed with court reporting restrictions on security grounds that it would put her at risk of extortion but she was unsuccessful			2
the emails lift the lid on their secret lives of luxury and offers the first real insight into @entity4 's richest family			1
in one email , daughter @entity50 emailed her mother asking for $ 225,000 for a chef to prepare ' detailed menus and food for most or all family and social events ' as a birthday present			1
the 26 - year - old wrote : ' i need a few things for my birthday ( cook so you can be sure april is fed right , bodyguard so the kids are safe and housekeeper that is good kids so if i need to go out i can ) and i found a great agency here that sources the best , here are the descriptions and costs , i would buy them myself but i 'm down to my last $ 60 000 and your only paying my husband $ 1 a year			1
' ms @entity50 , who lives in @entity75 , also complained that her mother had tried to get her to move to @entity76 or @entity4 to save money			1
she continued : ' i do n't want to have to move back to one of your ' desirable ' countries again just to save every cent ... it 's not fair you are selfishly pressuring me to move to @entity76 and @entity4 just because you hate @entity84			1
' and another daughter , @entity85 , 31 , who lives in @entity86 , also requested a bodyguard			1
@entity88 talks with @entity11 during @entity89 held at @entity90 in october last year she wrote to her mother : ' we are , by all accounts , the highest risk family in all of @entity4 for future similar attacks			1
' i would like to have security personnel present as you have with @entity97			0
unfortunately i do not have the financial means to achieve this and ask that you consider sponsoring such an arrangement or please makes funds available			0
' ms @entity50 also complained about the ' peer pressure ' that comes with being a member of one of the country 's richest families - adding that her mother ' did n't understand '			1
she said : ' i do n't think you understand what it means now that the whole world thinks you 're going to be wealthier than @entity111 - it means we all need bodyguards and very safe homes ! ! i should have enough money to have a bodyguard , housekeeper and cook			1
even my friends who have nothing compared to your wealth have more staff			0
' ms @entity11 , whose fortune from her minerals empire more than doubled in 2011 to a $ 10.3 billion ( Â£ 6.8 billion ) because of a commodities boom , has tried desperately to suppress publication of details of her dispute with three of her four children			1
she is said to shun the limelight and is bound to be mortified about the contents of the emails			0
it was revealed in september last year that ms @entity135 was being sued by her children for control of the family trust			2
only one of her three children , daughter @entity33 , has taken her mother 's side			2
the rise of the ' @entity144 ' @entity11 is the @entity145 's wealthiest woman , based on @entity147 ' tally @entity148 @entity11 could soon become the world 's wealthiest woman after amassing an $ 18billion fortune from mining and media investments , @entity147 said in its latest list of the wealthiest people in @entity4			2
the 57 - year - old widow saw her fortune almost double after a deal signed last month that will see @entity160 steel giant @entity159 take a 15 per cent stake in her @entity163 iron ore mine in @entity4 's @entity165 iron belt			0
the deal valued the project at $ 10billion , boosting @entity11 's fortune dramatically			2
in the next few years , @entity11 also has plans to expand her iron ore operations and develop two coal collieries			0
if commodity prices hold up , @entity11 could challenge @entity173 , worth $ 24.5billion as the world 's richest woman , @entity147 said			2
@entity173 is the widow of @entity176 , one of the sons of @entity178 , the founder of retail chain @entity179			0
for now , @entity11 will have to be content with being the @entity145 's wealthiest woman , based on @entity147 ' tally			0
@entity11 is the daughter of @entity19 , an @entity148 prospector credited with discovering giant deposits of iron ore in the 1950s that now make up @entity4 's largest export base			0
@entity186 alone relies of @entity148 iron ore for nearly half its imports of the key steel - making ingredient , and @entity190 , @entity160 and @entity191 also are big buyers for their steel mills			0
known as the ' @entity144 ' , @entity11 is also building stakes in some of @entity4 's largest media companies , drawing comparisons to another famously powerful @entity148 , @entity197 , head of @entity199 and now a @entity84 citizen			0
