by @entity0 published : 00:44 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 02:25 est , 7 june 2012 thieves have stripped lead from the roof of the church where the @entity5 sisters are buried , causing thousands of pounds of damage to the historic building			1
the @entity8 , has told of his ' great sadness ' and claims that they may now even have to think about different material for the roof to prevent further vandalism			1
he also said that the raids on @entity15 , where the @entity5 ' father was once the reverend , may also have contributed the problems of a leaking roof which is causing religious paintings inside to ' literally start to disappear			1
' stealing history : @entity15 , in @entity21 , @entity22 where thieves have stripped lead from the roof a £ 1.25 million scheme is about to start to restore the 1879 fabric of the @entity22 churchbut its targeting may force @entity29 to replace the @entity31 roofs with something other than lead to deter the thieves			1
mr @entity8 said : ' my response is one of great sadness because of the lack of respect it shows not just for churches but historic buildings in general			2
' other buildings in @entity44 have also been attacked for lead including the local school and community centre			1
distressed : the @entity48 , has told of his ' great sadness ' and claims that they may now even have to think about different material for the roof to prevent further vandalism ' we have suffered at least three metal thefts in 18 months			1
they have stripped lead from the @entity59 roof and over the vestry			1
' as a result we have had quite significant amounts of water come into the building			2
' the damage runs to tens of thousands of pounds for the roof alone whereas the scrap value will be in tens of pounds			1
he said the main church roof was very long and it would have been been very heavy for the thieves to carry out in one job			1
he also told how the church had reached its insurance limit			0
' for a large amount of effort for very little reward they have caused so much damage to our infrastructure and the other damage is hard to put a figure on			0
' rain had been seeping into the building anyway because the roof was reaching the end of its life			2
however , three raids by metal thieves on the @entity31 roofs may have contributed to the water damage inside the church , he feared			2
burial place : a painting of the @entity5 - left to right , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			0
at the church a floor plaque marks the graves of @entity98 and @entity97 he said : ' the plaster is starting to fizz and you can see the damp and stains in the plaster work			0
' it was also damaging @entity110 style paintings depicting @entity112 stories which were put up on the walls			2
he said : ' they are beautiful paintings but they are literally starting to disappear			1
' the church is to close on july 8 for 15 weeks for the first stage of a £ 1.25 million scheme backed by @entity29 to completely restore the building , including the religious paintings			1
it was in the hands of @entity29 and the architects whether lead was used for the roof or another material less attractive to thieves			1
he said : ' it would be a great pity if it was not lead because it is traditional and we are in a heritage site			2
' but metal theft has become endemic and reached the stage where it is damaging the whole country			0
' the church 's modern fame is chiefly due to its connections with the @entity144 sisters and the link is what attracts thousands of visitors each year			2
the reverend @entity144 , father of the authors , was the incumbent from 1820 to 1861			0
he died in 1861 aged 84 , having outlived his entire family and having served the parish for 41 years			0
members of the family , including @entity97 and @entity98 , are buried in the family vault adjacent to the present south - east chapel			0
there was a national outcry from @entity5 enthusiasts in 1879 when it was decided to take down the old church building and build a new one			0
however , the building was unsafe and unsanitary as water from that graveyard was seeping in through the floor , so the scheme went ahead			0
however , the church remains as place of pilgrimage for visitors from all over the world			0
leaflets in the church have been translated into @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity172			0
a floor plaque marks the early graves of @entity98 and @entity97 .			0
