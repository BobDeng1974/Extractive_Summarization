by @entity0 an @entity2 baby has been born with a huge tumour on the right side of his face , causing his head to become heart - shaped			1
@entity7 , who is two weeks old , has a massive growth which has been increasing in size rapidly since before he was born			1
he has been left with a drastically swollen and misshapen head			1
@entity7 has a huge , and rapidly growing , tumour on the right - hand side of his face now , his parents are desperately trying to raise money to pay for him to have treatment			1
@entity7 is the second child of mother @entity16 , 22 , and father @entity17 , 32 , who works as a farmer in a remote and isolated area of @entity20			2
‘ i am confused of what i have to do with my son			0
i can only submit myself to the fate , ’ mrs @entity21 said			0
@entity7 is currently being cared for at @entity25 in @entity26 , the capital of @entity20 province			2
he was born weighing a healthy 7lbs with the help of a midwife			2
his mother said she experienced no major problems during her pregnancy , although she did feel nauseous from the fourth month onwards			0
@entity7 's parents are desperately trying to raise money for him to have surgery to remove the tumour however , because the couple live so far from a hospital , she was forced to rely on medicine from small shops in nearby villages			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ well , what else should i do ? i 'm completely flustered			2
i can only be resigned to accept it			0
‘ at first my son was hospitalised in @entity47 in @entity48 , then he was referred to be taken care at a hospital in @entity51			0
‘ there , they could n't do much for my son 's disease either			0
therefore , we took our son to the @entity58 ( @entity59 )			0
’ the tumour has prevented part of @entity7 's skull forming properly meaning surgery to remove it would leave his brain exposed however , unhappy with the treatment their son received there , the couple transferred him to @entity25			1
the parents are now trying to raise funds to pay for the growth to be removed , although surgery will have to be delayed until @entity7 is at least three months old			1
at present , the operation is considered too risky as the tumour has left the baby 's skull open and unformed on the right half of his face , leaving his brain exposed			1
@entity7 's mother says her pregnancy was normal but that she felt nauseous from the fourth month the tumour has affected the functioning of @entity7 right eye , but more extensive examinations are needed to see if his other organs are working normally			1
‘ hopefully my son will be recovered soon , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
‘ some people have already helped , but it is n't enough yet			0
in fact , there has n't been any help from the local government of @entity48			0
’ @entity94 is attempting to establish where donations can be sent .			0

@entity7 , who is two weeks old , was born with a huge facial tumour
his parents are trying to raise money for him to have surgery
the tumour has left his skull unformed on one side of his head
this means if it was removed , his brain would be exposed
