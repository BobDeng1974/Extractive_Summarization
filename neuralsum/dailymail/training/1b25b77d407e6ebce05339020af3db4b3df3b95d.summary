by @entity0 last updated at 7:58 pm on 15th november 2011 hero : @entity2 has raised more than $ 250,000 to help build new homes for the victims of the earthquake in @entity6 @entity2 has spent a large part of her life dedicated to the relief effort in the desperately poor @entity11 country of @entity6			1
her tin - rattling , pledge - inducing exploits have raised an incredible $ 250,000 which has been spent on building 27 homes on the earthquake - torn island			1
all in all , not bad for a 12 - year - old			2
the families in the village of @entity21 were so delighted with their new homes , they have baptised the housing development ' @entity24 '			2
but her dream has not stopped there			0
she now wants to rebuild the local school , which was severely damaged in the 7.2 - magnitude earthquake which devastated the country in early 2010 , killing 316,000 and leaving 3million homeless			1
' life is life , ' she told msnbc.com			2
' you ca n't expect to change @entity6 overnight with the snap of the fingers			1
you have to work at it			0
you have to make it happen			2
' three years ago , when she was just nine , the @entity41 youngster tagged along to a meeting about the charity work being carried out in @entity6 by @entity44			1
there , she met @entity46 , the head of the aid agency , who described the famine , disease and homelessness affecting the children so badly			0
but just as her mother , @entity52 , thought her daughter did n't understand what was being discussed , @entity2 stood up on a chair in front of all the adults and pledged to build 12 homes			1
what a relief : nine - year - old @entity2 is surrounded by grateful @entity6 in @entity21			1
the families were so pleased with their new homes they have named the development ' @entity24 ' humanitarian effort : not content with just building homes , @entity2 also delivers care packages to villagers on the earthquake - struck island @entity2 ran bake sales , passed the tin at homecoming games and sold homemade potholders at her @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity41 , it was reported on msnbc.com			1
through her @entity80 page and by word - of - mouth , a cherry farm in @entity78 heard about @entity2 and sent along the proceeds from one of its season 's harvest			1
another generous donation came from a family that regularly supports the overseas work of @entity44			0
@entity2 , who has been to @entity6 twice to see the abject poverty first - hand , has more than doubled her promise			1
a family enters their new abode for the first time			0
such was the alien environment of these houses , many of the residents had to be shown how to use a lock and key safe haven : workers build the concrete , earthquake - proof homes in @entity21 - 27 of which have been paid for with money raised by @entity2 over the last three years she spent $ 170,000 on brand - new earthquake - proof cement structures that shelter 27 families in @entity21 , a small fishing village outside of the capital @entity109			1
many of the residents had spent their whole lives in makeshift homes and tents - @entity44 needed to give them instructions on how to use a lock and key on their new abodes			2
mr @entity46 said @entity6 would be a ' completely different country ' if everyone helped like @entity2 had done			1
' after nearly two years ( since the earthquake ) , there is still so much great need			0
the children are experiencing an incredible amount of pressure			0
' there are n't enough schools to go around and there is a lack of clean drinking water			0
people do n't have the ability to look after their children properly or build their own home			0
there is so much unemployment it is unreal			0
' teamwork : the youngster with @entity46 , the head of aid agency @entity44 , whom she met at the meeting in @entity41 three years ago which encouraged her to help out determined : @entity2 ran bake sales and encouraged businesses to donate money to make her promise a reality @entity2 has about half of the money needed to re-build the @entity151 school in @entity21 , where 200 students learn in classrooms that have no walls , a patched tin roof and dirt floors			1
classrooms are partitioned by bed sheets			0
the school ' library ' is a simple wooden table displaying no more than 30 tattered books			0
each child owns just a single pencil and notebook			0
@entity44 has worked in @entity6 for 25 years			1
the charity runs hundreds of food pantries that feed more than 400,000 people daily and supports dozens of free health clinics			0
many young @entity6 suffer from deadly diseases such as cholera , which has killed more than 6,200 @entity6			2
