' i obviously want and i will come back to the national team , ' @entity2 told @entity17 magazine			2
' the pre-season preparation went well and we are well prepared for the start of the ( @entity22 ) season			0

it got worse as a further injury upon his comeback saw @entity2 miss the selection for the @entity4 squad that went on to win the @entity5 in @entity33			1
in his absence , @entity51 took on the responsibility as @entity4 's sole forward			0
the striker has now retired internationally , adding to the likelihood of a @entity2 return			0
@entity4 manager @entity58 will imminently name his squad for their friendly against @entity5 finalists @entity62 on september 3 and their first @entity64 qualifier against @entity65 four days later			2
comeback : @entity2 wants to return to the @entity4 team after being sidelined by a long - standing injury proven : the 29 - year - old has 59 caps and 25 goals to his name but was last capped more than a year ago again ? @entity2 and @entity75 's @entity74 ( left ) could link up for the @entity4 team if the striker can earn a recall			1
