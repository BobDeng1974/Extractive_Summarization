@entity2 , 17 , had taken the day off school while he was ill and left the front door open as he stepped outside			1
but the door closed behind him and he is understood to have tried to scale a 6ft tall fence to get in through the back garden in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the teenager was found by a neighbour slumped in the front garden fitting and bleeding heavily from the head , the inquest in in @entity21 , @entity15 heard			2
the inquest heard that @entity2 had been at home alone after his mother @entity24 reported him sick to school after he was sick three times in the night			1
mrs @entity27 range her son from her workplace to check up on him at around 3.30pm			0
he seemed confused and disorientated			0
she left work early and returned to the family home to find her neighbour @entity33 hunched over @entity2 who was in a pool of blood and suffering seizures			1
he was airlifted by air ambulance to the specialist head injury unit at the @entity39 in @entity40 , where he underwent emergency surgery but never regained consciousness			0
he died two days later , on november 30 , last year			0
police investigated the death but were left puzzled as to what happened			0
one theory detectives suggested was that @entity2 had locked himself out of the front door and had been trying to climb the six foot side fence to access the unlocked back door when he fell			1
fall : the teenager was found in a pool of blood and having seizures after suffering severe head injuries consistent with falling from a height coroner @entity57 concluded that this theory was the most likely when he recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest on thursday			0
mrs @entity27 told the coroner : ' we as a family are at a loss as to what happened			0
the only logical reason he sustained the injuries is if he had fallen when climbing the fence			1
' detective constable @entity70 said : ' it is not known why @entity2 had left the house			1
it is believed he must have been climbing around the back when he fell			2
' the post mortem examination found that @entity2 had died from severe head injuries consistent with a fall from a height			2
death : the street in @entity14 , @entity15 , where the teenager died after trying to climb over a 6ft fence to get into the back garden while being locked out coroner @entity57 , in recording a verdict of accidental death , said : ' while at home alone @entity2 has apparently locked himself out of the property			1
it seems to me he deliberately left the front door but that has closed behind him			0
' it 's logical that having found himself locked out , the obvious step would be to climb the wall and gate to the side of the property to access the back door			2
' however , because he was feeling unwell and weaker than normal he has fallen and suffered a head injury			0
' it does n't explain all of the information but potentially it is as close as you can get to explaining these tragic circumstances			0
