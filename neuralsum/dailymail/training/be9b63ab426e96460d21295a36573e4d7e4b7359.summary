very little has gone wrong for @entity0 this summer , until , that is , the @entity4 captain 's close encounter with the controversial ' @entity5 ' which appears to have hindered his attempt to take a vital catch on day three of the fourth test on thursday			1
in what was a frustrating morning session for the home side and the skipper in particular , a miscue from @entity11 batter @entity10 sent the ball skyward and @entity0 made ground to position himself underneath it for the catch			1
but just as he appeared in control of the catch , out it spilled and @entity0 immediately pointed skyward , suggesting the camera , perched on wires above the ground , may have interfered			1
@entity4 captain @entity0 gets underneath the ball after a top - edge by @entity30 's @entity10 and looks set to take the catch dropped			1
@entity0 points to the sky after spilling the chance , appearing to claim he was unsighted by the ' @entity5 ' which is strung on wires above the field of play to give an aerial view of the game this is @entity5			2
the unit strung above grounds for major sporting events by broadcasters like the @entity44 to give an aerial view of the field of play it continued a session of near - misses for the home side , @entity0 clearly upset with team - mates when a gilt - edged opportunity to effect a run - out was also spurned , soon after his @entity11 counterpart @entity47 came to the crease			2
but the drama with the camera and the catch was his alone			0
the @entity44 sports team has responded , suggesting there was no impact between ball and camera ahead of @entity0 dropping the chance that was n't supposed to happen			1
everything @entity0 has touched this summer has turned to gold , except this catch off @entity30 's @entity10 the dropped catch is one of the few things to have gone amiss during the cricket season for @entity75 's new @entity74 captain , who has led his side to a series win and leads the run - scoring too the @entity44 has responded with a tweet which said : ' word from @entity5 is that the ball did not hit the camera or wires '			1
it appears most likely @entity0 was either unsighted at some point or put off by the equipment as he positioned himself			0
and this has been confirmed by a joint statement on thursday afternoon , by @entity88 and the @entity44			2
' we ( @entity90 ) have spoken about the matter involving @entity5 and the dropped catch before lunch and it â€™s clear the ball did not hit the camera or its supporting wires , ' the joint statement read			1
' captain @entity0 was distracted by one of the wires in his eye line			0
both @entity88 and @entity44 will continue to work together on the use of @entity5 in the broadcast coverage and will take on board any player feedback as necessary			1
' as it stands , if any player has a concern about the placement of @entity5 they can ask the umpires for it to be moved			0
' day three of the @entity74 is @entity111 in aid of breast cancer nurses fundraising			0
here @entity0 presents a pink cap to @entity4 fast - bowling great @entity115 @entity0 is the leading run - getter this summer , boasting an average of well over 100 during the four @entity74 series versus @entity30 @entity10 rubbed salt into the wound by going on to make a century before tea			0
@entity0 's rare bad day out in the middle continued when he dropped @entity47 off the bowling of @entity125			2
for @entity0 the home season of 2014 - 15 had been a red - letter summer , up until this point , joining the likes of sir @entity130 and @entity131 in scoring four straight centuries in consecutive test matches			0
he was elevated to the captaincy , @entity75 's 45th , when @entity135 succumbed to back and hamstring injuries after the first test in @entity138 .			0

@entity0 *fumbled* what appeared to be an easy catch
the @entity4 skipper seemed to *blame* the ' @entity5 ' used by the @entity44 to *provide* images from above the ground
the broadcaster and @entity88 have stated that the ball had not hit the camera nor the wires it is *suspended* on
but @entity0 's vision of the ball was impeded when he caught sight of it among the camera and wires
