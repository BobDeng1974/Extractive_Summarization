the family of @entity1 have said that the cop who shot him dead will ' feel the wrath of @entity5 's vengeance ' after the officer claimed he was acting in self defense			1
@entity8 , @entity1 's aunt , told @entity9 that she believes @entity10 committed murder and that he will suffer retribution in a ' mighty way '			1
she said that @entity10 's actions were ' evil ' and that he will be punished by a higher power for what he did - even if he is cleared			0
anger : @entity8 , left , with husband @entity18 , told @entity9 that @entity10 will suffer retribution in a ' mighty way ' her comments are the most outspoken yet from @entity1 's family since @entity10 's account of what happened was published in the @entity25 at the weekend			1
the testimony - and alleged forensic evidence - has been described by experts as helpful to his defense and has provoked fresh outrage from the teenager 's family and supporters			2
@entity10 shot dead @entity1 , 18 , on august 9 , in @entity35 , a suburb of @entity37 in @entity38 , sparking nearly two weeks of violent protests and rioting			1
' self defense ' : @entity35 police officer @entity10 says he feared for his life as he shot @entity1 struggle : according to @entity46 analysis @entity1 's blood was found inside officer @entity10 's patrol car			1
the cop claims he wrestled with @entity1 in the car and was in fear of his life			2
but the account is disputed unrest has continued since then as a grand jury decides whether it will indict @entity10			2
a decision is expected next month			0
speaking to @entity55 said : ' it 's murder and they will feel and see the wrath of @entity5 's vengeance come upon them in a mighty way , just as he promised all who do evil in his sight			0
' @entity10 's account gave the first insight into what he told the grand jury during his four - hour testimony in september , a process which is held in secret			1
he supposedly said that @entity1 pushed him back into his police suv as he was trying to get out and pinned him down			0
at that point @entity10 reached for his gun and fired two shots , one of which hit @entity1 - his blood was found inside the car			2
the account did not explain why @entity10 then shot @entity1 five more times in the front as , according to some witnesses , he put his hands in the air to surrender			2
solidarity : protesters are pictured here in @entity35 monday night continuing a vigil for @entity1 tensions : police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again , more than two months after the shooting @entity1 's supporters are worried that @entity10 is trying to exploit the law in @entity38 which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat			1
@entity10 's account also flatly contradicts that of a number of witnesses including @entity1 's friend @entity105 , who was standing next to him at the time			1
@entity105 has said that @entity10 was the aggressor and grabbed @entity1 's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot			1
but another witness , whose name has been withheld , has also reportedly told the grand jury that @entity1 did not have his hands above his head when @entity10 shot him but instead they were ' out to his sides			1
' he also said @entity1 ' staggered toward @entity10 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			2
' among those who have already spoken out to attack @entity10 's statement is @entity122 , the attorney for @entity1 's family			1
he has said that @entity10 's account should ' not be taken as gospel '			0
he said : ' he can say what he wants to say in front of a jury			0
they can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody			0
fervent : a woman holds up a sign protesting the treatment of black people by law enforcement memorial : neighbors wait by a memorial set up on @entity142 , @entity143 - the spot where @entity1 was killed ' the officer 's going to say whatever he 's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid			0
' the @entity147 also called it a ‘ @entity150 defense , ' referring the @entity152 man who was convicted of shooting dead a black teenager because he was playing music too loudly			0
@entity147 has said : ' it did n't work in @entity152 and it should n't work in @entity38 ’			0
residents of @entity35 fear that violence could return to their streets if @entity10 is not indicted - which is a very real possibility			2
the @entity25 reported that , according to officials with knowledge of the grand jury hearing , the forensic evidence does appear to support @entity10 's account			1
another issue is the potential civil rights prosecution brought by the federal government after attorney general @entity167 began an @entity46 investigation			0
condemnation : @entity147 on sunday hit out at @entity10 's version of events			0
and the @entity1 family lawyer , @entity122 , said : ' the officer 's going to say whatever he 's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid ' @entity176 , a professor at the @entity177 in @entity37 , has told @entity9 that a charge of civil rights abuse would be a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter			1
he said that this is because the jury would have to be certain @entity10 intended to violate @entity1 's civil rights by shooting him dead			1
he said : ' the federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse			0
' there are some criminal charges that do n't involve that kind of mental state , like murder			0
they can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly , but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right			0

officer @entity10 told grand jury that he felt in fear for his life when he was attacked by @entity1 before shooting him dead in @entity35 , @entity38
officials said that the testimony and evidence was ' helpful ' to his case
@entity1 's aunt @entity8 *angrily* told @entity9 that he *'ll* suffer retribution in ' mighty way '
