the @entity0 will today accuse @entity1 of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market			1
@entity4 will say that @entity1 has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services , which include @entity10 and the @entity12 social network			1
in one of the most high - profile competition cases of recent years , @entity13 could fine @entity1 more than £ 4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in @entity13 to the perceived dominance of @entity20 tech companies			1
@entity1 currently boasts a 90 per cent share in @entity13 's search engine market			1
the @entity0 will accuse @entity1 of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market but the ruling - the result of a five - year investigation into the @entity20 search giant – means @entity1 may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to @entity4			1
@entity31 , the @entity0 's competition commissioner , will today serve the company with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules , according to the @entity35			0
@entity1 's competitors , including the computer giant @entity37 and sites such as travel booking firm @entity39 and @entity40 , claim that its method of promoting its own companies above rivals on its search site stops them competing on a level playing field			2
and in a further blow to @entity1 , the @entity0 is also expected to probe @entity1 's operating system for @entity49 smartphones			2
the investigation will centre on whether @entity1 imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps , such as @entity10			0
@entity1 has previously rejected the allegations , and insisted that @entity49 is an open platform that is distributed for free			0
@entity31 , the @entity0 's competition commissioner , will today serve @entity1 with a formal charge sheet after charges are issued , @entity1 will have ten weeks to reply to @entity4 , according to the @entity35			1
they will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing			0
the investigation into @entity1 began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms			0
@entity1 offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case			0
most recently , just over a year ago , it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website			0
however @entity13 initially accepted that deal , only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions			0
@entity31 , @entity13 's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit @entity77 political drama series @entity78 , took over the job in november and vowed to take @entity1 on			1
insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the @entity0 's decade - long battle with @entity37 , which ultimately cost the company £ 1.6 billion in fines			1
if @entity1 fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by @entity4 , the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed £ 4 billion - about 10 per cent of @entity1 's most recent annual revenue			1
the move will stop short of previous threats that the @entity0 executive could consider breaking up @entity1 to separate its business from the search engine			1
@entity1 has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years			0
but the latest move by the @entity0 marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing			0
the search engine is far more dominant in @entity13 than it is in the @entity20 – where rivals like @entity37 's @entity102 enjoy a share of the market			1
and there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of @entity1 from many countries in the @entity0			2
in fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals			2
more than two dozen @entity13 organisations have filed antitrust complaints against @entity1			2
many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in @entity119			0
they have previously called on the @entity13 regulator to force the @entity20 search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps , shopping and travel services			1
and in @entity128 , lawyers have this week called on @entity1 to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites – but @entity1 argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam			1
@entity1 and the @entity0 commission declined to comment last night			2
@entity31 's department is also looking into the tax affairs of @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			0
in a recent @entity143 article she said big companies should pay more as they ' are part of our society			0
' insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the @entity0 's decade - long battle with @entity37			0
