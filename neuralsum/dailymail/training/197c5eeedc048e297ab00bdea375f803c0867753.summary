@entity0 wants to banish his nearly - man reputation in the @entity2 and lead his @entity4 side all the way to @entity7 glory			1
the 53 - year - old lost as a player whilst with the @entity4 as @entity9 lifted the trophy in 1990 after a replay , and came within seconds of leading @entity12 to the famous cup in 2006 only for @entity14 to thrash home a stoppage - time equaliser - with @entity17 going on to win on penalties			1
since then @entity0 's luck has been in short supply , winning just one @entity2 tie in his near - four - year reign at @entity23 before he left the club to return to @entity25 at the start of the year			1
@entity0 said @entity4 have no chance of winning the league , but could win the @entity2 but he led @entity4 to victory at @entity30 in the third round , his first game in charge , and visits another former club in @entity35 on saturday looking to push on for another tilt at the trophy			1
' i 've had a couple of near shaves , ' he said			0
' i think i 've been in a winning position after 12 minutes against @entity9 and it got away from us			2
and about two minutes against @entity17			0
' so it would be nice to get a big trophy over the line but they 're not easy to come by in today 's game when you 're at clubs with such a disadvantage but the club does even it up			2
' the chance of us winning the @entity56 is more or less zero or one per cent i should think			1
but winning the cup is a possibility			2
' @entity0 stressed the importance of cup success when it comes to building relationships with the fans @entity0 knows how a good cup run as a manager can endear you to the club 's fans - something he has already enjoyed since being appointed as @entity70 's successor in south @entity71 given his previous spell with the club			1
' we ( @entity12 ) came within two minutes of winning it , a penalty shoot - out - my god , ' he said when asked about his links with the competition			2
' it gives you an affinity with the fans , here ( at @entity4 ) and at @entity12			1
every @entity12 fan that talks to me talks about the @entity2 final , they ingrain you into the history of a football cub so it is very important for a manager 's cv , his ego and his personal ambition			1
it is an opportunity i think			0
' @entity0 could be forgiven for spinning his @entity2 yarns to his players ahead of their tricky tie at @entity98 's , but he is loath to do so - backing his side in a difficult game			1
@entity0 has won all three games since taking charge at his old club @entity4 ' sometimes i might use an example of the fighting spirit from cups in the past but i do n't really bring up my time too much , it can get a bit boring for players			1
they would just say , ' oh yeah ? when was that , when the ark was built ? ' , ' he said			0
' for us , this group are a good fighting team and should make for a good cup team , they do n't throw the towel in even when they are under heavy pressure			0
@entity2 games ebb and flow and you get surprising results			1
' i think it would be a surprise if we beat them but it is possible			0
' the trip to the south coast will not be the first time @entity0 has revisited the club he managed for a 13 - month spell until a falling out with then - chairman @entity130 in august 2010			2
he helped rebuild @entity35 and led them to the @entity131 and admits he enjoys seeing their successes and his role within it			2
@entity0 and @entity4 face @entity35 at @entity98 's in their @entity2 fourth round clash ' i get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a few players we had , ' he added			1
' in particular ( @entity143 ) @entity142 , ( @entity145 ) @entity144 and @entity146 a little bit			0
i think they are three great guys and i 've followed their careers since			0
i take a lot of pride in that they have done so brilliantly			0
' i do n't really look for praise , to be honest			0
i think when you go into a football club you try to put some foundations down and i 've tried to do that at all my clubs			0
' i thought we were good in the transfer market at @entity35 in the first year i was there			2
we brought in @entity144 , @entity161 and @entity162 and they went through all the divisions with them			0
and we picked them up for peanuts really			0

@entity0 said @entity4 have no chance of winning the league
but the former @entity23 boss feels differently about the @entity2
@entity4 face @entity35 at @entity98 's in the @entity2 fourth round
