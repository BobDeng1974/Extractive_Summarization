@entity0 flew into a rage after learning that prosecutors had been given permission to appeal his murder acquittal - opening the door for a stiffer 15 - year prison sentence			1
state lawyers yesterday won their bid to challenge the manslaughter verdict handed down to the @entity10 for killing his girlfriend for which is serving a five - year prison sentence			1
a fellow prisoner at the @entity16 jail in @entity17 said the double - amputee athlete ' lost it ' after hearing the ruling on the radio			1
the source said : ' he got up and stomped			2
he went straight to the gym			2
he started lifting weights like it was going out of fashion			0
he is p * * * * * off			1
' legal experts said it was unlikely that @entity0 would now be released on house arrest after serving just ten months of his sentence as he had previously hoped			1
' @entity0 can barely console himself over the fact that he will be here for @entity45 and @entity46 , instead of jolling with his family and friends			2
' prosecution lawyers applied for leave to appeal after judge @entity33 in october sentenced the @entity10 gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest			2
the state lost an application to challenge that sentence - although it could still petition that decision			2
@entity0 admits shooting his girlfriend @entity37 four times through a locked toilet door on @entity39 2013 , insisting he thought she was an intruder			2
after a seven - month trial , judge @entity33 found him guilty of culpable homicide , equivalent to the @entity66 crime of manslaughter , after throwing out a more serious charge of murdering miss @entity69			2
@entity71 's state prosecutor @entity70 arrives at the high court in @entity17 , @entity71 state prosecutor @entity70 said in his application to appeal that the judgement was ' shockingly inappropriate ' and requested permission to seek a murder conviction , which would carry a minimum 15 - year jail term			1
@entity78 argued that even if @entity0 did not know @entity69 was behind the door when he fired , the athlete showed intent to kill whoever was in the small toilet cubicle			1
@entity0 's jail term will not be extended unless the state convinces the @entity86 to overturn the original culpable homicide verdict			1
@entity88 , of @entity71 law firm @entity89 , said an appeal court will decide whether or not judge @entity33 made a mistake in her interpretation of the law when she found @entity0 guilty of culpable homicide			1
if the panel decides judge @entity33 did err , they will look back at the facts presented in the original trial and could then convict @entity0 of murder if they decide the facts of the case support that , mr @entity88 said			1
@entity102 , the prosecution spokesman , said he hopes the appeal will be ' expedited ' but acknowledged that the process can take a long time			0
in arguing for an appeal , the prosecution said the judge incorrectly interpreted a legal principle			0
under that principle , a person should be found guilty of murder if he foresaw the possibility of a person dying because of his actions and went ahead anyway			0
' we 're happy , ' mr @entity102 said after the hearing			0
once prosecutors appeal the conviction , the appeals court will review the case to determine if the verdict was appropriate			0
@entity0 could be out of jail and serving out the rest of his five - year sentence on house arrest by the time prosecutors can appeal his conviction , an expert said today			1
@entity129 , a top @entity71 criminal advocate , said the appeal was n't likely to be heard until summer 2015			0
@entity0 was sentenced to five years in jail on october 21 , but according to @entity71 law he can be eligible for release to house arrest after serving just one - sixth of that sentence , equivalent to 10 months			1
that means that if the @entity137 agrees he 's no longer a risk to the public @entity0 could be out by august 21			1
mr @entity129 said the appeal was likely to be heard by @entity71 's @entity86 in @entity140			0
' there 's a big question mark over the meaning of dolus eventualis , ' he said , referring to the legal principle the interpretation of which lies at the heart of the appeal			0
' whether she ( judge @entity33 ) applied it correctly or not is the issue			0
' the @entity86 will want it because they want to clear up exactly what it means			0
' ahead of the application , miss @entity69 's mother , june , said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter 's death			0
she told @entity164 from @entity165 : ' i wanted the truth ( at the trial ) , but it seems some of the puzzle is missing			0
' there 's only two people who know what happened			0
one of them 's my daughter and she 's not here anymore			0
' she said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family			2
mrs @entity69 added : ' what difference is it going to make to me ? i wanted to see him go down the steps [ to the court cells ]			0
' so it does n't really matter how long - he 's going to know that he ca n't go around hurting people			0
' mrs @entity69 and her husband @entity188 previously said they felt ' let down ' by @entity71 's justice system after @entity0 was acquitted of murder			1
in a bizarre twist , @entity192 , one of @entity71 's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials , said @entity0 could actually apply for bail even though it ' would cause a public outcry '			1
he told @entity199 : ' they could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence			2
' the prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down			0
' ' shockingly inappropriate sentence ' : addressing judge @entity33 in the same @entity17 court where the murder trial was conducted , prosecutor @entity70 ( above ) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law judge @entity33 ( above ) granted the appeal and the case will now be heard in @entity71 's @entity86 in @entity140 , the country 's judicial capital another lawyer said the decision to throw out the @entity223 murder trial in @entity224 yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair			2
prosecutor @entity70 argued in appeal papers filed last month that judge @entity33 misinterpreted the law when she ruled @entity0 did not intentionally shoot @entity69 , describing the sentence as ' shockingly light ' and ' inappropriate '			1
@entity0 , a @entity71 athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able - bodied runners in the @entity235 , can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars , which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls			1
@entity37 's parents @entity244 and @entity246 , previously said they felt ' let down ' by @entity71 's justice system after @entity0 was acquitted of murder , bit found guilty of manslaughter @entity250 said that with the decision of a @entity224 court to throw out the @entity223 case - another high - profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - @entity71 's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair			1
' from a perception point of view , both public and internationally , we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system			0
' @entity0 , who celebrated his 28th birthday last month , has been serving his sentence in a @entity17 prison			1
behind bars : @entity0 admits shooting his girlfriend @entity37 ( pictured ) four times through a locked toilet door on @entity39 last year , telling the court he thought she was an intruder ' he 's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners			1
there are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed , ' said his older brother @entity281 , in an interview with you magazine , a @entity71 tabloid			0
@entity0 has been accused of receiving special treatment in @entity71 's notoriously corrupt prisons , where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars			2
yet @entity281 dismissed claims his brother is living the good life , saying @entity0 relies on weekly 45 - minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks , including baked beans and canned pilchards			1
' he now lives moment by moment , ' said @entity281			0
' there 's no fairytale			0

*successful* appeal could lead to a stiffer 15 - year prison term for murder
@entity0 flew into a rage after hearing the ruling on the radio in his cell
prisoner : ' he got up and stomped straight to the gym . he is p * * * * * off '
