by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 1 october 2013 thoughtful : naturist @entity1 leaving @entity3 a former mayor has been cleared of committing a sex act while sunbathing naked but is still banned from going into his garden without clothes on			1
@entity1 , 67 , was cleared of committing a sex act in front of other people and children when he was spotted by a neighbour			1
the former mayor of @entity14 has been a naturist for 30 years and regularly enjoys sunbathing in his garden while nude			1
but when he was accused of outraging public decency by committing a sex act he and his family found the accusations ‘ devastating ’ and he was subsequently suspended from the conservative party			1
councillor @entity1 appeared at @entity20 this week where judge @entity21 said he was of ‘ positive good character ’ and had spent much of his adult life serving the community on a voluntary basis			1
she told him : ‘ you took inadequate steps to ensure that you could not be seen			2
’ judge @entity21 added that @entity29 had been convicted of no offence and had not admitted , or been found guilty of , committing a sex act in his garden			1
@entity32 , for the prosecution , said neighbours were holding a barbecue with friends and two children could see that councillor @entity1 was sunbathing naked in his back garden and was asleep			1
he was later seen by an adult looking over a fence applying sun lotion ‘ but also to the area of his genitals ’			2
‘ he accepts that he did not take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure he was n’t visible by others , ’ he added			2
caught : mr @entity1 was seen applying lotion to his private parts by someone looking over the fence councillor @entity1 has been given a three - year restraining order , with a condition that he is banned from being in his garden unless his private parts are covered by clothes			1
councillor @entity1 has said he was more than happy to accept this order in a bid to resolve any difficulties			1
he said after the hearing : ‘ i am delighted with this not guilty verdict , not only for myself and my family , but also for my conservative colleagues , who i work with			0
‘ it ’s clearly been a great pull on everybody ’s health			0
this has opened the door for us to move on and get on with our lives			0
relief : mr @entity1 , pictured during the election results of the north - east @entity74 local elections 2012 , was delighted with the verdict ‘ i would like to thank everybody , including friends , local business people and neighbours , for all their support			1
’ his jubilant daughter , @entity81 , 34 , said she was ‘ truly over the moon ’ at the ‘ fantastic ’ outcome of a not guilty verdict			0
she said : ‘ the past few weeks have been simply devastating			0
‘ the false accusations came as a complete shock			0
we are just so delighted finally to see the case not just dismissed from court , but officially closed with a ‘ not guilty ’ verdict			0
‘ to the kind and caring people who expressed their sympathy and backing following the malicious allegations - thank you			0
defence solicitor @entity97 said : ‘ this is a case about privacy			0
the defendant had created what he believed to be a private space in his back garden , where he believed he was not overlooked			2
’ ‘ he fell asleep at a time when there was no one about and , when he awoke and realised people were in the next door garden , he moved into an even more secluded position			2
’ ‘ he is a man with almost 40 years ’ public service and he has had his reputation and private life dragged into the public domain and into the gutter by a misconceived prosecution			0
the restraining order had been jointly drafted and agreed between the prosecution and defence ‘ to calm a situation blown out of proportion ’ , said mr @entity97			0
‘ mr @entity1 has never broken the law in his life so it gives him no difficulty in agreeing to the order being made			2
