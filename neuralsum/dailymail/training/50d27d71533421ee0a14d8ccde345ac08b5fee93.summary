by @entity0 published : 23:00 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 04:53 est , 18 january 2013 the world 's largest auction house @entity2 saw record sales of £ 3.9billion last year , boosted by a growing demand in contemporary art. the @entity7 - based auction house saw sales of works by post-war and living artists grow 33 per cent in 2012 , as it set a company record for the third successive year			1
among the works behind last year 's boom for the company , which saw sales rise by ten per cent on last year , was @entity18 's @entity17 , which fetched a record £ 53.8m , and @entity21 's @entity20 , which sold for $ 43m			1
@entity18 's @entity17 ( left ) sold for £ 53.8m while @entity23 's @entity22 ( right ) fetched $ 43.7m as @entity2 's saw record sales last year @entity26 's ' portrait of @entity27 ' was among the works which helped boost @entity2 's sales by ten per cent in 2012 @entity30 , the first @entity31 to head the auctioneer since its creation in 1766 , said the key to future success relied on a broad pool of art lovers			1
the 58 - year - old said : ' one of the things that is driving the opportunity for a company like @entity2 is cultural			0
' there is a huge cultural surge around the world toward the experience of art. ' museum attendance is way up on the previous year and the year before that ... people are accessing art on their @entity52 , on their laptops , on their iphones			1
' the overall increase in 2012 came despite a slump in @entity2 's auction sales of @entity59 art , which fell by a quarter to £ 415m after providing the engine for growth in recent years			1
the auction house has said its sales were boosted by a surge around the world ' toward the experience of art ' competition from @entity69 auctioneers and the end to a speculative bubble in some @entity59 art contributed to the decline , but mr @entity30 said the region had the potential to grow again longer term			1
in contrast , @entity2 's saw private sales surge 26 per cent to £ 631m , and mr @entity30 expected deals behind closed doors to be key in maintaining growth in 2013 and beyond			0
he said : ' look for a big increase in our private sales activity			0
' our current clients want to do more of that			0
' a key part of mr @entity30 's strategy since arriving has been to build its online presence , both by attracting visitors to the website and encouraging them to bid over the internet			0
@entity21 's @entity20 , which was the second most expensive item sold at @entity94 's last year when it went for $ 43.7m from six online - only auctions in 2012 , the company will hold more than 30 in 2013 , and while digital sales tend to be for more modestly priced items , @entity95 's ' october on @entity96 ' sold for $ 9.6 million to an internet bidder in november			2
by expanding its online presence , @entity2 's aims to capture more business in the mid to lower - tier markets , away from the multi-million - dollar deals that grab the headlines			0
@entity30 pointed to a 20 per cent rise in sales at @entity2 @entity111 offices , which specialise in lower - end art and antiques			2
@entity2 's @entity111 offices , which specialise in lower - end art and antiques , saw a 20 per cent rise in sales			2

@entity7 - based auction house saw interest in contemporary art boost sales
@entity123 's said rise was *due* in part to ' cultural surge ' toward art
last year 's rise came despite slump in @entity59 art sales , which fell by a quarter
