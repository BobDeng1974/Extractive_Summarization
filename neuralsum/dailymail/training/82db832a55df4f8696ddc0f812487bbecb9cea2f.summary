a quick end : @entity1 pictured in @entity2 on friday , is said to want a swift divorce @entity5 and @entity1 will be divorced within weeks after reaching a swift agreement to avoid airing their dirty laundry in public , it emerged yesterday			1
documents were lodged with the @entity11 last week after the couple – estimated to be worth £ 150million – negotiated a settlement through miss @entity5 ’s lawyer , @entity14			1
experts said yesterday it is likely that a pre-nuptial agreement was signed when they wed in 2003			1
although the pair , who shared a £ 12million @entity21 home , have agreed never to publicly disclose the terms of the divorce or financial settlements , it is understood mr @entity1 dispensed with lawyers to deal directly with miss @entity14 in an attempt to keep his multi-million - pound art collection intact			1
yesterday , friends of mr @entity1 said : ‘ he and @entity5 agreed – via @entity14 – to a speedy divorce			1
@entity14 is @entity5 ’s first cousin and @entity1 highly respects her			1
‘ he did not hire a lawyer himself and he has not even spoken to @entity32 , whom a sunday paper claimed he has hired			0
‘ @entity14 prepared a full court document , every detail of every asset was listed , and an agreement was reached with no dispute			2
‘ they have agreed never to make public the terms of the divorce or financial settlements			2
@entity14 lodged the divorce document with the court last friday			1
’ @entity43 , who advised the @entity44 in his divorce and represented sir @entity46 , has been nicknamed the @entity47 for her charm and determination			2
miss @entity5 ’s marriage to mr @entity1 unravelled five weeks ago when he was photographed grabbing her throat			1
the former advertising tycoon initially brushed off the incident as nothing more than a ‘ playful tiff ’ , but further images revealed miss @entity5 suffered 27 minutes of anguish and had her nose repeatedly tweaked and twisted by mr @entity1			2
at one point he even put his finger up her nose as they dined outside @entity63 ’s restaurant in @entity2			0
anguish : @entity5 is said to have been ' floored and blindsided ' by the @entity66 's wish to end their ten - year marriage mr @entity1 later accepted a police caution for assault			1
friends say miss @entity5 , 53 , was willing right up until the end to give their marriage another chance and was left ‘ floored ’ and ‘ blindsided ’ by his decision to begin divorce proceedings against her			1
they were reportedly arguing over miss @entity5 ’s son @entity77 and daughter @entity76 from her marriage to journalist @entity79 , who died in 2001 from throat cancer			2
just days ago mr @entity1 appeared to blame miss @entity5 for the end of the marriage , claiming he decided to divorce her after she refused to defend him in public			1
he also alleged that she had held him by the throat during arguments at home			0
@entity88 , director of family law at @entity90 , said last night : ‘ it is also likely that they will have signed a pre-nuptial agreement as they both came into the marriage with considerable assets and with family			2
‘ they may have dusted that off and used it as a basis to help them come to a mutually acceptable financial agreement			0
‘ because of the nature of the allegations they will be compromising a little more			0
the grounds for divorce will be the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage			0
broken marriage : @entity1 and @entity5 are pictured at @entity63 's restaurant in @entity112 where the devastating photographs were taken ‘ in this case i think they may have agreed the basis for divorce and agreed the wording between them			1
‘ it is usual for the division of financial assets and the divorce to be done together and for the process to be concluded within months			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s millions were amassed from the advertising agency @entity66 , which he founded with his brother @entity127 , now @entity128 , and various astute business deals			2
he has traded art over the years , making large profits on works by @entity133 and other @entity135 artists			0
his collection is reported to be worth £ 200million			0
the @entity137 , which mr @entity1 opened in 1985 , has included some of the @entity135 ’s most controversial and talked - about artworks			0
the current exhibition includes work from @entity142 , who makes papier - maché sculptures of household objects , and a piece by @entity146 and @entity147 of a giant bust of a man made from paper			0
mr @entity1 also famously bought @entity152 ’s work @entity151 for £ 150,000 , for which he got an unmade bed littered with condoms , cigarette packets and underwear			0
