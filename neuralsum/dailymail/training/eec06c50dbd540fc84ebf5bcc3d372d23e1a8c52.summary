strolling outside his @entity4 home , one of the few men convicted over the grooming scandal was free to walk the street last night			1
@entity6 , 26 , has been released from prison less than four years after he was convicted of grooming a 13 - year - old girl for sex			1
he is now able to walk freely through the town where he and four accomplices sexually exploited teenage girls			2
he was given a four - year jail sentence for grooming a girl of 13 , but has now been released meanwhile his victim – and hundreds of others like her – are forced to live in fear			1
many are forced to endure the fact that their abusers never faced justice as a result of shocking blunders by police and council workers			0
his freedom last night became a symbol of the catastrophic failure to protect vulnerable girls in the town from abusers			2
now , police in @entity4 are facing searching questions about how they are going to catch the ‘ hundreds of child rapists ’ who are thought to be still at large			1
the @entity40 force pledged to ‘ relentlessly ’ bring the sex predators to justice after a damning report exposed the abuse suffered by at least 1,400 girls at the hands of @entity48 men			1
but serious concerns over its ability to conduct such complex investigations have been raised because of its appalling failures in such cases to date			0
a lawyer representing the victims said police had missed ‘ clear opportunities ’ to bring sex offenders to justice			2
there has been only one successful prosecution , in 2010 , for sexual offences by @entity48 men against @entity4 girls			1
this resulted in the conviction of five @entity71 - born @entity70 men – including @entity6			1
to outsiders , he lived a reputable , middle - class life			0
by the age of 20 , he had secured a job as a mortgage advisor , owned two semi-detached houses and ran a cafe and several other businesses			0
but beneath the facade of respectability , @entity6 was living a life of depravity			2
in 2008 he began grooming the 13 - year - old girl for sex			1
he gave her cannabis , drove her around in one of his two cars , and persuaded her that they had a future together			1
his victim later told police that he spoiled her ‘ like a princess ’			0
despite being well aware of her tender age , he promised the child they would settle down together			0
but when he had gained the girl ’s trust , he went on to viciously assault her , raping her in the car he had first used to impress her			0
when his crime finally came to light , he told police he had only given her a lift			0
he told officers : ‘ she looked no more than ten or 11 years old – the same age as my little brother			0
‘ there ’s no way i ’d touch her			0
’ @entity6 received a jail sentence of four years and was placed on the sex offenders register			2
last night , he was already out on the streets of his hometown			0
by contrast , @entity6 ’s victim , who had been abused by five different @entity48 men , said at the trial : ‘ i do n’t think i will ever be able to return to @entity4 and feel safe without looking over my shoulder			1
’ the 26 - year - old gave the girl cannabis , drove her around in one of his two cars and promised her they had a future together @entity129 of @entity130 , who is representing 15 of the victims in a class action against the police , said yesterday : ‘ @entity134 failed to act on information which could have led to the arrest of perpetrators			1
’ @entity138 , the mp for @entity139 who exposed the @entity141 scandal , said urgent action was needed to catch the criminals who have committed ‘ appalling child sex abuse on an industrial scale ’			2
‘ there are many , many other perpetrators of this type of crime out there – hundreds of child rapists out there , ’ he said			1
‘ what are @entity134 doing to catch these people ? ’ no police officer has yet been sacked or disciplined over the failures in @entity4			1
the two chief constables at the helm during the height of the failings have since left on hefty pensions			0
the devastating @entity4 report by professor @entity163 revealed how officers from @entity134 treated victims with ‘ contempt ’			2
they turned a blind eye to their plight and in many cases held them responsible			0
this included the case of an 11 - year - old who was viewed by police as having ‘ consensual sex ’ with an adult man .			0
