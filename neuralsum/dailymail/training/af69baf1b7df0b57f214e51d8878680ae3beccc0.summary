by @entity0 more than 3,500 people died unnecessarily in @entity3 hospitals last year because of mistakes and blunders , shocking new figures reveal			2
the number of ‘ avoidable ’ deaths admitted by @entity3 trusts in @entity10 rose by 25 per cent in a year , while experts warned ‘ toxic overcrowding ’ could contribute to even more fatalities in overstretched hospitals this winter			1
the figures include cases where patients have died after being given the wrong medicines , have suffered fatal surgical mistakes or simply died because staff failed to spot they were deteriorating fast			1
hundreds more vulnerable patients under mental health care have taken their own lives			1
the new figures , from the @entity25 and @entity26 , show the number of patients who died due to safety incidents rose from 2,864 in 2011/12 to 3,588 in 2012/13			2
thousands more were reported as suffering harm while in hospital			1
with the @entity3 braced for what many believe will be its toughest winter ever , medical experts fear there will be even more serious ‘ patient safety incidents ’ in the coming year			2
leading @entity38 doctor @entity37 said official figures showed emergency departments were ten per cent busier than last year , presenting a risk of ‘ toxic overcrowding ’			1
‘ if it ’s overcrowded , the quality of care suffers			0
worse than that , mortality rates rise , ’ said dr @entity37 , president of the @entity43			0
‘ if a doctor is dealing with six patients when they might normally deal with four , they will not be able to review their patients as regularly			0
’ paramedics have warned that closing @entity38 departments is costing lives because it forces them to resuscitate patients in ambulances overcrowding could also lead to patients being discharged because there were no beds available , dr @entity37 added , resulting in them dying due to a lack of medical attention			1
@entity63 , chief executive of the charity @entity64 , said ‘ obvious ’ blunders like medicine errors and surgical mistakes claimed lives but less obvious faults could also be fatal			1
‘ it could be something as simple as letting a bedsore develop , which becomes infected , ’ he said			0
sometimes staff are so busy , they failed to realise a patient is going downhill until too late , he added			1
@entity74 , of the @entity75 added that there was now ‘ a solid evidence base ’ that not having enough nurses on wards ‘ increases the risk of things like medical errors , pressure sores and patients having trips and falls ’			1
dr @entity86 , president of the @entity87 , said : ‘ hospitals are already very close to being full to bursting			0
every day doctors are hoping more patients will leave than need to come in – but that does n’t always happen			0
’ errors in acute hospital trusts account for almost half reported deaths , with 1,463 dying due to safety incidents , up 10 per cent			1
at @entity96 in @entity97 , 66 died			0
@entity98 was @entity99 , with 44 deaths			0
yet neither was included in last summer ’s review of hospital trusts with high death rates , led by @entity3 medical director professor sir @entity105			1
paramedic @entity106 quit his job five months after @entity38 in @entity108 closed in fact , none of the 10 hospital trusts where the most patients died last year due to blunders were part of the @entity115 , raising the possibility watchdogs are missing problem hospitals			1
however , the @entity118 did recently give both @entity119 and @entity121 ‘ high risk ’ ratings , and results of intensive new inspections will be published soon			1
deaths due to mistakes at mental health trusts showed the biggest annual rise , from 1,285 to 1,909			0
however , that was largely due to new reporting rules stating all suicides of patients should be classed as safety incidents			0
commenting on the figures , dr @entity134 , a former hospital chief executive who lectures at @entity135 , said : ‘ i think it ’s just the tip of the iceberg			1
’ hospital managers are now legally obliged to report all incidents leading to severe harm or death			2
but dr @entity134 said in many places a culture of not owning up remains			0
‘ what is recorded is just a small amount of what happens , ’ he said			0
dr @entity151 , associate director of patient safety at @entity10 , argued the increasing number of fatal safety incidents was the result of better reporting			0
she added it was impossible to compare trusts because they still reported the figures in different ways			0
the @entity119 trust said its figures on fatal patient safety incidents were ‘ inaccurate and inconsistent with the true picture of care ’			0
paramedics have warned that closing @entity38 departments is costing lives because it forces them to resuscitate patients in ambulances			1
they said they struggle to perform life - saving cpr as they are flung around inside speeding ambulances diverted to other hospitals			2
@entity106 , 60 , who was a paramedic for 30 years , quit five months after @entity38 in @entity108 closed			1
@entity3 bosses had ordered mr @entity106 to drive heart attack and stroke victims to hospitals such as @entity180 near @entity181 , 23 miles away			2
he said : ‘ it was one reason why i quit			0
the closure put patients at risk			2
’ stressing the difficulties of performing cpr inside ambulances , he added : ‘ sometimes , i ’ve fallen on the floor and injured myself			0
it ’s always better to do cpr on a hospital flat bed than in an ambulance			2
’ @entity3 figures , from a @entity194 request , show that in 2008 the number of patients from @entity197 who died on their way to @entity180 was seven			0
in 2011 , when @entity38 closed down , the so - called dead - on - arrival figures increased to 11			1
by 2012 the number had jumped to 12			0
dr @entity201 , of the @entity202 , said : ‘ if you close down @entity38 wards , more people will die on their way to hospital			1
’ a spokesman for @entity197 and @entity209 said : ‘ if patients are gravely ill they are taken to the hospital with the facilities that best serves their needs			2
