by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ charliesale the man heading investigations into alleged corruption surrounding the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity7 will meet @entity9 officials in @entity10 on monday			0
the independent inquiry by @entity13 ’s chief investigator @entity12 has taken on extra significance after further claims over the weekend about the scale of secret payments that helped @entity9 win the @entity18			1
prior to the latest revelations , @entity13 were hoping the @entity22 lawyer ’s report would have been completed before the start of the @entity18 in @entity24			2
@entity13 secretary general @entity25 wanted a swift conclusion so there was no shadow hanging over the 2014 tournament which kicks off next week			1
allegations : @entity31 is at the centre of the claims , with @entity13 investigating the @entity34 hosts : @entity9 held off competition from @entity37 to win the rights to host the @entity34 but there now seems no hope of that happening as documents obtained by the @entity43 have thrown the world governing body into chaos			1
the newspaper claims that @entity9 @entity31 , the former @entity13 vice-president , used slush funds from 10 private company accounts to make dozens of payments in return for votes			1
the allegations include : on sunday , calls for a re-vote came from within @entity13 ’s own organisation , with vice-president @entity57 saying he would support such a move should corruption allegations be proven			1
in an interview with the @entity61 , @entity57 said : ‘ i would have no problem if the recommendation was for a re-vote			0
‘ if @entity12 reports that wrongdoing happened for the 2022 vote then it has to be looked at very seriously			2
’ reserving judgement : @entity70 chairman @entity69 says if corruption allegations are proven the 2022 bidding process needs to start again rivals : @entity31 ( right ) tried to run against @entity74 ( left ) for @entity13 president but withdrew following allegations of bribery @entity70 chairman @entity69 said : ‘ some of this evidence , on the face of it , is quite compelling			1
if the evidence is there that the process is corrupt , then obviously the process has to be looked at again			2
’ @entity13 ’s communications department directed all media enquiries to @entity12 and ‘ the office of the chairman of the @entity89 ’			1
@entity9 ’s @entity18 bid committee issued a statement			0
it said : ‘ following today ’s newspaper articles , we vehemently deny all allegations of wrong - doing			2
we will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the bid ’s integrity			0
the right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the @entity102 to host its first @entity18			0
’ but the @entity43 report claims 65 - year - old @entity31 was lobbying on @entity9 ’s behalf at least a year before the decision to award the country hosting rights			1
bribes : former @entity13 vice-president @entity109 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) faced allegations of bribery surrounding the 2011 @entity13 presidential elections @entity13 : @entity31 ( left ) and @entity74 ( right ) at @entity113 in 2010 in the past @entity9 , and indeed @entity13 , have insisted any such activity by @entity31 has centred around his attempt to secure votes for the 2011 @entity13 presidential election , when he intended to stand against @entity74			1
he withdrew before the election			0
back in july 2011 @entity31 was banned from football for life after being found guilty of bribery			0
the ban was annulled a year later by the @entity123 , which said there was insufficient evidence to support the punishment			0
but @entity13 then issued a second life ban in december 2012 for ‘ conflicts of interest ’ while acting as president of @entity131 football			1
the latest allegations still fall short of exposing any @entity13 executive committee members requesting cash or favours in exchange for votes			2
but @entity138 , chairman of the @entity139 , said : ‘ there have already been serious doubts raised about the capability of @entity9 to host the @entity34 on football grounds			0
if the choice of @entity9 was as a result of improper payments being made , then that strengthens an already strong case for re-running the whole 2022 contest			0
’ @entity18 ? there have been suggestions that a re-vote will be required after these new allegations			0
