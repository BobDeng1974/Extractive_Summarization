@entity7 ( @entity8 ) @entity6 42 fireworks lit up the desert night and sparks glowed from under the cars , but nothing shone brighter in the @entity14 than the luminous talent of @entity0			1
such is his form at the start of the season that we could easily mistake the extraordinary for the routine			2
the hard facts are that @entity0 ’s third win in four races extends his lead in the championship to 27 points over his @entity2 team - mate @entity3			1
but the @entity1 driver ’s performances are almost certainly the most complete of his startling career			1
@entity0 celebrates winning the @entity14 ahead of @entity5 and @entity2 team - mate @entity3 ( right ) @entity7 , who finished second , applauds @entity0 after the @entity33 claimed his third victory in four races so far this season @entity0 extended his lead the formula one world championship with yet another flawless victory in @entity38 1			1

his goal is to match sir @entity84 ’s record of three titles , as we were all reminded when the @entity87 , who competed in a different and more dangerous age , conducted the podium interviews			0
@entity84 has occasionally been a critic of @entity0 , and not without his reasons , but he was happy to acknowledge on sunday night that the reigning double world champion is ‘ the best out there at the moment ’			1
@entity0 ’s faultless behaviour extended to the celebratory spraying of rose water — the substitute drink in these religiously more abstemious countries			1
there was no repeat of his turning the fizz on a somewhat trapped stewardess as he did in @entity103 seven days earlier			0
in place of that unchivalrous act , he acted with total restraint , looking at the grey - suited women at the side of the presentation party but studiously keeping his distance			1
@entity0 ’s joy must have been immense though			1
he had beaten @entity3 , a specialist in @entity38 , in qualifying and in the race			2
whether the @entity4 can recover from this kind of mauling is open to question			0
however well he drives , he may never be a match for @entity0 at his greatest the championship dynamic developed in another important way : the @entity120 of @entity5 and @entity7 look set to stay in the hunt			1
the internal rivalry at @entity6 may be as important to the outcome of the title as the one , albeit potentially fading , at @entity2			0
@entity7 was second with a strong drive from fourth on the grid , a place ahead of @entity3 , who drove with real gusto but struggled with brake problems			1
it was always going to be hard to match the front - to - back excitement of last year ’s race here			0
this edition did not reach those towering standards , but there was still a smattering of thrills during the 57 laps of a race whose efficient organisation , friendly paddock , and perfectly choreographed lights are a model of excellence for all grand prix hosts to emulate			0
the race started with a close dance between the leading cars			0
@entity3 , in desperate need of a spark to light his championship challenge , dived down the right of the straight , was blocked by @entity5 , and then overtaken by @entity7 as the second corner swept round to the left			1
but @entity3 harried @entity7 ’s red machine until he made his brave — arguably reckless — move going into the first corner at the start of the fourth lap. it worked , just			1
@entity0 turned in a strong display at the @entity166 to win in @entity38 for the second consecutive year @entity0 leads the early phase of the grand prix from the @entity6 pair of @entity5 , who finished fifth , and @entity7 @entity6 team principal @entity171 was unimpressed , the @entity172 mouthing a few words of pure @entity174			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , was running serenely at the front			2
@entity3 was on a charge			2
he got close to @entity5 when the @entity4 ran wide			0
it was a fine move , with the titanium underbellies of both cars sparkling in the dark			0
@entity3 held @entity5 off and powered through			2
he was now running second behind @entity0 , who was in clear command			2
@entity182 came the opening round of pit stops			0
@entity5 was first in of the front - runners			0
@entity3 was in next but emerged from the pits behind the man he had just sweated blood passing			2
@entity0 was soon in but a slow wheel change delayed him — a mistake for which the team apologised over the radio — as @entity5 and @entity3 were now flying around			1
suddenly , @entity0 ’s gap had narrowed to under a second from more than five seconds @entity0 leads the pack on the run down to turn 1 ahead of @entity5 and @entity3 as sparks fly in @entity38 @entity0 leads the field round on the pardare lap in @entity38 , the fourth round of the championship @entity0 is now 27 points clear of @entity2 team - mate @entity3 as he bids to win his third championship @entity3 immediately passed @entity5 again with another close - your - eyes , hold - on - to - your - hats move			1
could @entity3 conjure something special and catch @entity0 ? no. if the opportunity was ever there , it did not last long			1
@entity0 was away , @entity3 ’s hopes of victory evaporating in an instant			1
the next round of stops came along			0
@entity5 was again first in ; @entity3 was next , only to come out behind @entity5 again ; @entity3 then passed @entity5 once more when the @entity6 ran wide			2
but up front now , having stopped only once , was @entity7 on a different tyre strategy			2
he would stay out longer before putting in a final burst on the faster soft tyres			0
@entity7 was left with about 20 seconds to make up in 17 laps			2
his deficit was 16.2sec with 15 laps remaining			0
he was now three seconds quicker than the @entity2 and on course			0
he continued to eat into those in front of him — @entity0 and @entity3 ( who finally got his place from a sometimes erratic @entity5 when the @entity6 car needed a new nose )			1
@entity7 could not catch @entity0 , but @entity3 , suffering brake problems , ran wide and the @entity6 went through for second			1
watching from the @entity59 hospitality area was @entity79			0
his car , which broke down in qualifying , did not recover from its electrical gremlins to allow him to race			0
it was only the third race of the last 272 staged the @entity33 has missed			0
he tweeted his thoughts from his chair in the paddock , as his countryman shone brighter than all the stars			0
@entity0 crosses the start - finish line to win his third race of the season under the lights in @entity38 the @entity33 , who now has 36 career wins , celebrates his victory with an air golf swing after leaping out of his mercedes pastor @entity69 and @entity75 battle for position with sparks flying off their cars			1

@entity0 extended his lead in the @entity257 championship with yet another flawless victory this season
the @entity1 driver secured first place ahead of @entity7 and @entity3 who finished second and third
@entity0 has now set a *personal* best record of finishing in the points for 11 consecutive grands prix
he has 36 career wins , with *21* of those from pole position to open up a 27 - point gap over team - mate @entity3
