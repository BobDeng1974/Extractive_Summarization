memory : flowers at the memorial stone remembering the 21 victims outside @entity191 , @entity4 ' he said it would take months to centralise the files , bundle them into segments and then be scanned by a small team to enable him to fully answer the questions we have asked him			0
' what we want to know is how much physical evidence there was from the bombing itself like clothing for example or debris which might contain dna evidence			2
' if the @entity213 murder trial came about because of a blood splatter on a jumper , then there must be some evidence from the bombings which can help trace the killers			2
' i am encouraged that mr @entity34 will get the evidence in one place but there is still a hell of a long way to go before those who are responsible will be brought to justice			2
' it is appalling that in a civilised country the mass murder of 21 innocent people has not been investigated and those who committed the atrocity have been allowed to go free			0
' @entity42 was just 18 when she was killed			0
she had been accepted to study law at @entity233 but she never lived to see the letter of acceptance , she would have been 56 this month			0
