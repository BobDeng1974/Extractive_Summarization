by @entity0 published : 03:24 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 05:11 est , 9 october 2012 @entity2 has been shipping oil to the @entity5 government to provide it with vital fuel at a time when @entity5 is under international sanctions , it was claimed last night			1
documents unearthed by the @entity10 show that the @entity2 government , led by prime minister @entity12 , is providing @entity5 with 720,000 tons of fuel oil in a one - year contract			1
@entity16 's @entity15 is supported by the @entity17 , and there are concerns in @entity20 about the contract with @entity5 , which is currently under trading sanctions			1
the @entity23 delivered oil worth $ 14 million over june and july - with the payments made in cash			2
@entity2 oil to sanction - hit @entity5 : a worker turning a valve at the @entity31 oil field , where oil was first pumped in @entity2 in 1927 , outside the northern city of @entity34 a @entity36 official , speaking anonymously , said the shipments did not violate @entity39 or @entity40 sanctions			1
but he added : ' perceptions matter , so we encourage countries trading with @entity5 to be open about their legal and non-sanctionable exchanges			0
' if this is going to continue , we think the @entity2 should be up front about it			0
' the news comes after @entity39 officials complained that @entity2 was allowing @entity52 planes - carrying weapons - to fly across its airspace on their way to @entity5			2
@entity5 or @entity2 did not respond to requests for comment			0
meanwhile @entity57 has authorised troops to launch cross-border attacks against @entity5 yesterday as its military fired on targets in the country for a second day			1
the attacks yesterday was in retaliation for shelling by @entity5 forces that killed two women and three of their daughters in the @entity57 border town of @entity69 last wednesday			1
deadly strikes : smoke rises after a mortar bomb fired from @entity5 landed in @entity57 soil on the @entity57 - @entity5 border in southern @entity74 on monday @entity57 president @entity75 said on monday the ' worst - case scenarios ' were now playing out in @entity5 and @entity57 would do everything necessary to protect itself , as its army fired back for a sixth day after a shell from @entity5 flew over the border			1
@entity75 said the violence in @entity57 's southern neighbor , where a revolt against president @entity83 has evolved into a civil war that threatens to draw in regional powers , could not go on indefinitely and @entity83 's fall was inevitable			2
' the worst - case scenarios are taking place right now in @entity5			2
our government is in constant consultation with the @entity57 military			2
whatever is needed is being done immediately as you see , and it will continue to be done , ' @entity75 said			0
' there will be a change , a transition sooner or later			0
it is a must for the international community to take effective action before @entity5 turns into a bigger wreck and further blood is shed , that is our main wish , ' he told reporters in @entity105			0
an unknown number of @entity5 troops based near a checkpoint were said to have died in the reprisals			0
the bill paves the way for unilateral action by @entity57 's armed forces inside @entity5 without the involvement of @entity57 's @entity116 or @entity117 allies			1
@entity57 has used a similar provision to repeatedly attack suspected @entity120 rebel positions in northern @entity2			0
@entity5 has admitted it was responsible for this week 's shelling and formally apologised for the deaths , a top @entity57 official said			1
@entity57 's deputy prime minister @entity125 has reassured the @entity126 that ' such an incident will not occur again			0
' the violence , which prompted @entity129 to convene an emergency meeting , marks a dangerous escalation of the war which has engulfed @entity5 for 18 months			0
@entity133 , a senior adviser to prime minister @entity134 , said : ‘ @entity57 has no interest in a war with @entity5 but @entity57 is capable of protecting its borders and will retaliate when necessary			1
the border violence has added a dangerous new dimension to @entity5 ’s civil war , dragging its neighbour – a sanctuary for 90,000 refugees – deeper into a conflict activists say has killed 30,000 .			0

@entity5 pays in cash before each delivery of oil - even as regime 's reserves of money *plummet*
@entity57 continues military strikes against @entity5 in retaliation for death of five civilians killed last week
