@entity0 may not want to rake over his difficult relationship with @entity2 ahead of @entity4 ’s game at @entity5 on monday night , but he ’s only too happy to lavish praise on his former player @entity7 and compare him to @entity8			1
@entity9 signed @entity7 – who has taken the @entity11 by storm with 10 goals already this season - as a raw 21 - year - old for @entity15 in 2007			1
two years later , the 6ft4ins @entity17 striker was part of the @entity20 ’s team that shocked traditional superpowers @entity21 , @entity23 and @entity24 to win the @entity26 title			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity7 has had praised lavished upon him by @entity4 boss @entity0 29 - year - old @entity7 in action for @entity5 during their 1 - 0 defeat to @entity31 on wednesday night @entity9 ( right ) compared the @entity5 forward to his @entity4 striker @entity8 @entity7 joined @entity5 for £ 9million in the summer and that already looks like a major bargain			1
@entity9 knows if in - form @entity4 are to win their fifth game in a row , they ’ll need to stop him			1
‘ i am not surprised by @entity7 because i knew when i bought him at @entity15 , he was an attacking ( focal ) point for the team , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve said about @entity8 that i like strikers who are an attacking point , not only a striker who scores goals			2
@entity7 also scores goals but @entity47 also scores goals			2
attacking point is very important			0
‘ he is also very creative			0
he is always seeing the third man			0
@entity47 is also always seeing the third man			0
those kind of strikers are the ones i like			0
it may be a surprise that he scored 10 goals – that is a lot – but he can do it			0
‘ i bought him after he played for the ( @entity59 ) under - 21s in the @entity60 that were in the @entity26			0
i visited the matches and saw him , and he came to @entity15			2
‘ we had @entity63 , one of the best strikers i have trained in my career , and he had to compete with him			0
i have trained a lot of strikers but he was one of the best and he had to compete with him which was not easy			0
but later on he came in the squad and showed his capacity			0
‘ then @entity2 bought him – because he was also manager of @entity15 – he took him with him to @entity23 and he explodes			2
it is fantastic for him			0
’ @entity9 will face off against @entity5 boss @entity2 on monday night at @entity73 's @entity2 was assistant coach to @entity9 during his time as coach of @entity76 it is the only time @entity0 voluntarily mentions @entity2			1
the pair have a notoriously frosty relationship dating back to their time at @entity21 a decade ago when @entity2 was manager and @entity0 technical director			2
@entity9 insists he will shake @entity2 ’s hand before and after the game without any problem , but wo n’t have time to engage in social niceties after the match as he will be too busy , pointing out he did n’t have a chance to chat with @entity91 after tuesday night ’s win against @entity93			1
apart from that , any attempt to elicit words about his relationship with @entity2 failed			0
‘ you do n’t listen , it is private , ’ glared the @entity4 boss			2
@entity9 will be keen to keep @entity4 ’s recent momentum going			1
@entity102 will be back after a minor knee injury to skipper the side and @entity8 is likely to be his partner with @entity106 and @entity107 on the bench			2
the @entity109 , whose loan period at @entity112 has been dogged by injuries , can expect to be asked by @entity0 to play with the under - 21 side at some stage to build his match sharpness			1
a top - four place remains @entity4 ’s over-riding ambition this season			1
‘ we are going the right way , ’ said @entity0 , who stopped short of guaranteeing fans @entity121 football next season			0
@entity106 is set to return to the bench after starting in the 2 - 1 victory against @entity93 in midweek @entity107 is also set to be on the bench again on monday night as he continues his return from injury			1
