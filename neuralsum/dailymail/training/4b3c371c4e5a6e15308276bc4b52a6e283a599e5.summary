get ready for a close encounter - of the blurred kind			0
in recent weeks there have been bizarre claims of alien cities on @entity5 , hovering saucers and artificially designed rocks			2
but now a shaky video has shown a @entity9 floating above the @entity10 - leading some to question if extraterrestrial life has been secretly making its way to @entity13			1
a video posted to @entity15 shows a black object floating above the @entity10 in @entity17 ( shown in red ring )			1
in the video the object moves across the screen before staying still			1
it moves at a steady speed across the sky before coming to rest			1
some have suggested that it might be an alien ufo the video , posted to @entity15 by @entity29 , shows a black orb hovering above the famous landmark in @entity17			1
the object makes its way slowly across the screen from right to left before then appearing to remain stationary in the air			1
and some have speculated that it may be an alien spaceship making its way slowly across the sky			1
speaking to @entity41 , dr @entity40 said that the first alien life we find might be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans , too , will one day be more machine than man			2
‘ if you look at our own civilisation , people are becoming more immersed in computers , and we can already see signs of it in our own culture , ' she said			0
‘ so it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological , we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “ upload ” themselves			0
‘ it sounds kind of crazy , and i do n’t approve of this as a philosopher , but i think the thing is that that ’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice			0
‘ @entity69 will be vastly older than us , so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of @entity72 that are far smarter than we are			0
' ‘ of course , there 's always the possibility this was a real @entity9 sighting , ’ reported the examiner			2
‘ silver orb spaceships are the latest trend , along with triangular aircraft performing amazing aeronautical feats			0
‘ so far , this @entity9 sighting seems to be the first incident catching a pulsating black orb @entity9 on video			1
’ on the video mr @entity29 explained how his wife and sister filmed the @entity9 while they were visiting @entity17			1
he said the shaking was due to her being ‘ freezing from holding the camera for so long with no gloves			0
’ he continued : ‘ she said at first she thought it was a balloon but it stopped all of a sudden and stayed in one place for a while			2
‘ she also ran out of disc space hence why the footage suddenly stopped			0
‘ what the hell was this guys			0
please tell me someone else got this on video to [ sic ]			0
’ while the prospect of this being an alien spaceship is alluring , the real answer is almost certainly that it is actually a solar balloon			1
a solar balloon is a black or dark object that gains buoyancy by being heated by the sun ’s radiation			1
heat inside the balloon expands as it is heated , causing it to rise as it has a lower density than the surrounding air			2
some have suggested that solar balloons could be used to explore @entity5 quickly and easily some day in the future			2
but for now they are only used on @entity13 - sometimes to perform experiments in the sky			0
while the prospect of this being an alien spaceship is alluring , the real answer is almost certainly that it is actually a solar balloon ( pictured )			1
a solar balloon is a black or dark object that gains buoyancy by being heated by the sun ’s radiation @entity9 expert @entity133 explained to the @entity41 that it was indeed most likely a solar balloon or possibly also a drone ‘ as it flies on a steady course ’			1
he speculated that it may have been staged , saying it is suspicious because ‘ it flies directly behind one of the world ’s most famous landmarks			0
’ and he added : ‘ also the camera suddenly cuts to a wider angle before the @entity9 re-emerges			0
‘ it is noteworthy that hoaxers have used helium filled @entity151 plastic ' solar balloons ' in @entity152 to create mass sightings of @entity9			0
‘ solar balloons are cheap to make or purchase , and can be identified because they do not make sudden or erratic movements and travel at a regular speed			2

@entity158 posted to @entity15 shows object floating across sky in @entity17
in the video the object moves across the screen before staying still
it moves at a steady speed across the sky before coming to rest
some have suggested that it might be an alien ufo
but it is more likely an object known as a solar balloon
this is a black or dark balloon that uses the sun 's heat to float
