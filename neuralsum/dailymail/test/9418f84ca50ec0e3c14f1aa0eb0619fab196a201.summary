the @entity1 spacecraft has taken its first colour image of @entity3 and its largest moon @entity4 ahead of its arrival in three months			1
taken from a distance of 71 million miles ( 115 million km ) , the blurry image does n’t reveal a huge amount of detail - but it is a sign of things to come			1
as the spacecraft gets closer and closer , the images will continue to improve until it flies by on 14 july - humanity ’s first ever visit to @entity3			1
nearly there : after more than nine years , the @entity1 spacecraft is now just three months away from its historic encounter with @entity3			1
and now the spacecraft has taken its first colour image , shown , revealing the dwarf planet ( the bigger blob ) and its moon @entity4 after a journey of more than nine years , @entity22 ’s @entity1 spacecraft is now reaching the climax of its thrilling mission			1
it has traveled longer than any space mission in history to reach its primary target - with its pedometer measuring more than three billion miles ( 4.8 billion km )			2
its arrival at @entity3 will be the last world in the ‘ classical solar system ’ to be explored			0
in july this year @entity1 will become the first spacecraft ever to visit @entity3			1
it was launched on 19 january 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave @entity38 orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner after passing the orbits of all the major planets from @entity38 to @entity42 , @entity1 is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion - mile ( 4.8 billion km ) journey			1
on 14 july 2015 the flyby of @entity3 will begin			1
using a suite of instruments , the spacecraft will map the surface of @entity3 and its moon @entity4 to a resolution of 25 miles ( 40km ) - far better than anything possible before			1
this will reveal the surface features of @entity3 - which may include ice			2
as it flies past , it will also look back at the two bodies against the sun , to look for telltale signs of an atmosphere			0
despite the long journey , @entity1 will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am gmt ( 06.49am est ) on 14 july and ending just after 2.15pm gmt ( 9.15am est )			1
after passing @entity3 , @entity1 will flyby one or several @entity65 ( kbos ) , other bodies beyond the orbit of @entity3			1
the mission will officially end in 2026			0
@entity3 was demoted from a ‘ planet ’ to a ‘ dwarf planet ’ in 2006 when other objects of a similar or greater size were found			1
but regardless , the mission is of huge importance for our understanding of how bodies form even at great distances from their host star			0
‘ @entity1 is one of the great explorations of our time , ’ said @entity81 scientist @entity80 at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84			1
‘ there ’s so much we do n’t know , not just about @entity3 , but other worlds like it			0
‘ we ’re not rewriting textbooks with this historic mission - we ’ll be writing them from scratch			1
’ the latest image of @entity3 and @entity4 was captured by the @entity95 camera on the spacecraft from a distance equivalent to the sun to @entity99			2
at a relative speed of 30,000 mph ( 50,000km ) , @entity1 will cover that distance in just three months			0
the image shows @entity3 with a sort of reddish colour and @entity4 - which is just over half the size of @entity3 - considerably dimmer			1
our best images of @entity3 so far are mostly attempts from @entity107 - but they are not much better than this photo			2
this makes the @entity111 mission particularly exciting , as it will reveal the surface of a world we know very little about			0
not since humans first started sending spacecraft into the solar system has a comparable mission been seen			0
our best images of @entity3 so far come from the @entity107 ( shown is one of the images ) , so the arrival of @entity1 is hugely exciting for scientists , who have waited many years to catch a glimpse of this distant world and unravel some of its secrets @entity1 ( artist 's illustration shown ) was launched on 19 january 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave @entity38 orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner			1
owing to the speed of @entity1 , the observations of @entity3 will last just two hours the flyby caps a five - decade - long era of reconnaissance that began with @entity99 and @entity137 in the early 1960s , and continued through first looks at @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 in the 1970s and @entity142 and @entity42 in the 1980s			1
@entity3 is an extremely distant world , orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than @entity38			0
it is about two thirds the size of our moon			0
with a surface temperature estimated to be -229 ° @entity150 ) , the environment at @entity3 is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface			0
@entity3 's moons are also in the same frigid environment			2
the moon @entity4 is almost half the size of @entity3			0
the moon is so big that @entity3 and @entity4 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			1
the distance between them is 12,200 miles ( 19,640 km )			0
@entity4 's orbit around @entity3 takes 6.4 @entity38 days			2
@entity4 neither rises nor sets , but hovers over the same spot on @entity3 's surface			2
the same side of @entity4 always faces @entity3 - this is called tidal locking			2
compared with most of the planets and moons , the @entity3 - @entity4 system is tipped on its side			2
‘ scientific literature is filled with papers on the characteristics of @entity3 and its moons from ground based and @entity38 orbiting space observations , but we ’ve never studied @entity3 up close and personal , ’ said @entity171 , @entity172			0
‘ in an unprecedented flyby this july , our knowledge of what the @entity3 systems is really like will expand exponentially and i have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries			2
’ such is the mystery of @entity3 that astronomers are not even sure what they will find on the surface			0
@entity3 , the largest known body in the @entity65 , is thought to have a nitrogen atmosphere and complex seasons			0
on its surface , it seems to have distinct markings , and it may have ice as well			0
the dwarf planet may even harbour an underground ocean			1
among its five known moons , the largest - @entity4 - may itself sport an atmosphere or an interior ocean , and possibly even evidence of recent surface activity			0
owing to the speed of @entity1 , the observations of @entity3 will last just two hours			1
but it will collect a huge amount of data on @entity3 and its moons , revealing unprecedented views - and with no other missions to @entity3 in the pipeline , they will be our only images for a very , very long time			2
' this is pure exploration ; we ’re going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes ! ” said @entity223 , @entity1 principal investigator from the @entity224 ( @entity224 ) in @entity225 , @entity226			2
' @entity1 is flying to @entity3 - the biggest , brightest and most complex of the dwarf planets in the @entity65			1
' this 21st century encounter is going to be an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of @entity233 in the 1980s			0
' not since @entity233 ( illustrated left ) flew past @entity42 ( right ) in 1989 and started taking pictures has such a reconnaissance mission been attempted			0
@entity1 ' mission represents the last of the worlds in the ' classical solar system ' to be explored - and will be our sole visitor to @entity3 for many , many years scientists still know very little about @entity3 ( illustrated left ) , its largest satellite @entity4 ( right ) and its other moons			1
@entity3 , the largest known body in the @entity65 , is thought to have a nitrogen atmosphere and complex seasons			0
on its surface , it seems to have distinct surface markings , and it may have ice as well @entity3 ’s smaller moons also are likely to present scientific opportunities			0
when the @entity1 mission was first devised in 2001 , it was a mission to just @entity3 and @entity4 , before the four smaller moons were discovered			1
the spacecraft ’s suite of seven science instruments - which includes cameras , spectrometers , and plasma and dust detectors - will map the geology of @entity3 and @entity4 and map their surface compositions and temperatures			2
the spacecraft will also examine @entity3 ’s atmosphere , search for an atmosphere around @entity4 , study @entity3 ’s smaller satellites and look for rings and additional satellites around @entity3			0
currently , even with @entity1 closer to @entity3 than @entity38 is to the sun , the @entity3 system resembles little more than bright dots in the distance			1
but teams operating the spacecraft are using these views to refine their knowledge of @entity3 ’s location , and skillfully navigate @entity1 toward a precise target point 7,750 miles ( 12,500 kilometers ) from @entity3 ’s surface			1
that targeting is critical , since the computer commands that will orient the spacecraft and point its science instruments are based on knowing the exact time and location that @entity1 passes @entity3			2
this image , taken by @entity22 's @entity107 , shows five moons orbiting the distant , icy dwarf planet @entity3			1
@entity292 ( initially designated @entity292 ) , is the innermost of the moons found by @entity107 over the past seven years			0
this image was taken with @entity107 's @entity296 on 7 july 2012 ' our team has worked hard to get to this point , and we know we have just one shot to make this work , ' said @entity302 , @entity1 mission operations manager at the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) in @entity83 , @entity84			1
' we ’ve plotted out each step of the @entity3 encounter , practiced it over and over , and we ’re excited the " real deal " is finally here			0
' the spacecraft ’s work does n’t end with the july flyby			0
because it gets one shot at its target , @entity1 is designed to gather as much data as it can , as quickly as it can , taking about 100 times as much data on close approach as it can send home before flying away			0
and although the spacecraft will send select , high - priority datasets home in the days just before and after close approach , the mission will continue returning the data stored in onboard memory for a full 16 months			0
beyond @entity3 , @entity22 is also planning to study one or two @entity65 ( kbos ) with @entity1 in the years after its historic primary mission .			1

@entity22 scientists in @entity84 are preparing for historic mission on 14 july
this is when @entity1 will arrive at @entity3 after a journey of nine years
and it has now released its first colour image - from 71 million miles away
the mission will be humanity 's first ever visit to the dwarf planet
