clubs who consider signing convicted rapist @entity2 should take fans ’ feelings into account first , according to @entity7 director @entity6			1
@entity6 brought @entity8 to his club in 2007 , who had been jailed for causing death by dangerous driving			1
now debate has risen over whether @entity2 , who has been linked with a return to @entity15 , should be allowed back into the game			1
‘ we were very mindful of the fans ’ thoughts , ’ said @entity6			1
@entity2 did not have his contract renewed at @entity15 when it expired in 2012 ‘ one of the major points for us was that @entity8 had shown a lot of repentance for what he had done			1
that played a big role in our thinking			0
‘ a lot depends on the public perception of the crime and the type of offence			0
‘ it ’s up to @entity15 what they do			2
what i would say is that the law states that this man can be employed again			0
’ meanwhile , deputy prime minister has warned club bosses they can not ‘ wish away ’ the @entity2 ’ rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans			1
an online petition against @entity2 return to @entity15 had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend , but by last night , more than 145,000 had put their names to it			1
the petition , set up by feminist campaigner @entity53 , calls on @entity54 , chairman of @entity15 , where @entity2 played until he was jailed , to ‘ refuse to reinstate @entity2 as a player ’			1
it argues : ‘ to even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist			2
’ @entity8 signed for @entity7 after he was jailed for causing death by dangerous driving today mr @entity67 , an mp in @entity68 , appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer @entity2 a way back			1
speaking on his weekly radio phone - in , mr @entity67 told @entity72 : ‘ i think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on , you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model			0
‘ you are taking on a role model , particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that , and he has committed a very , very serious crime			0
’ mr @entity67 repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians , but added : ‘ i really do think that footballers these days , they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people			2
‘ my opinion is this ; rape is an incredibly serious offence , unbelievably serious offence			2
@entity2 challenges @entity101 's @entity100 - winning captain @entity102 in an international in 2010 ‘ he has done his time but i just do n’t believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened			1
‘ and that is what he will be known for and that is something which , particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of			0
‘ i think football players these days , they get paid a lot of money , they are public figures and you ca n’t ignore that			0
’ rather than sack @entity2 when he was jailed , @entity15 instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012 and boss @entity122 says bringing him back to @entity123 should be a decision taken by the owner and not at football level			1
‘ we have had one or two discussions , we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time			0
@entity15 manager @entity122 said the decision lies entirely with the club 's board ‘ i have been involved in decisions , but it is very much a decision for the owners and when the time is right to say something as a club we will do that			2
‘ it is that sort of decision - it ’s above football level			0
‘ it ’s my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back , it ’s not my decision whether he comes back in the first place - that ’s theirs			0
‘ until the decision is made there is no point talking about it			0
‘ it ’s not been distraction within the camp			0
first of all he ’s not out yet and secondly the club have n’t made a decision and until those two things happen it is irrelevant			2
