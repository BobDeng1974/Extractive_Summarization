by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:03 pm on 22nd june 2011 the @entity3 ’s second @entity2 last night deliberately self - destructed in @entity5 's atmosphere			1
the ten - tonne atv @entity7 ferry - otherwise known as @entity8 - burned up on re-entry in a controlled dive over the @entity11			1
it had taken 1.3tonnes of rubbish from the @entity15 after spending almost four months docked in orbit			0
self - destruction : an artist 's impression of the @entity2 @entity7 ferry burning up on re-entry in a controlled dive over the @entity11 last night only a few hardy pieces of the craft survived and splashed into the uninhabited ocean at around 21.00 gmt. the area 's air and sea traffic were warned in advance and a no - fly zone was erected to prevent any accidents			1
atv - 2 ad delivered about seven tonnes of much - needed supplies to the @entity15 , including 1170kg of dry cargo , 100kg of oxygen , 851kg of propellants to replenish the station tanks , and 4535kg of fuel for the ferry itself to boost the outpost ’s altitude and make other adjustments			2
during the hectic mission , two @entity46 space shuttles and @entity49 ’s @entity48 cargo carrier visited the station , along with two @entity52 and @entity53 spacecraft			0
these required several changes of station altitude , mostly controlled by the @entity2 ’s thrusters			1
@entity8 ’s last important task was to give the station ’s orbit a big boost			0
one important sequence was performed on 12 june , another on 15 june and the last one on friday			0
the combined effect of these manoeuvres was to raise the station ’s orbit to around 235 miles			0
mid-mission : @entity2 - 2 docked at the @entity15 , where it stayed for four months @entity2 - 2 had taken 1.3tonnes of rubbish from the iss. it had delivered seven tonnes of much - needed supplies to the orbiting outpost the craft had undocked from the @entity15 on monday afternoon , when its thrusters gently increased the distance from the outpost			1
on tuesday afternoon , the @entity2 fired its engines twice to descend from orbit			1
the first burn dropped it towards @entity5 while the second directed it precisely towards its @entity11 target			2
hitting the upper atmosphere , the vehicle tumbled , disintegrated and burned			0
the remains struck the ocean at around 21.00 gmt. confident : mission directors @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 photographed just before @entity8 burned up on re-entry some aspects of a controlled destructive entry are still not well known , so @entity8 ’s last moments will be recorded by a prototype ‘ black box ’			1
the @entity94 gathered measurements on the location , temperature , pressure and altitude of the vehicle ’s break - up before ejecting			0
once it reached an altitude of about 11miles , it transmitted the information via the @entity105 sat - phone system			0
with this last phone call home , @entity7 - dubbed ' @entity7 ' in honour of the visionary 17th century @entity110 astronomer and mathematician - would have been productive right to the very end of a fruitful mission .			2
