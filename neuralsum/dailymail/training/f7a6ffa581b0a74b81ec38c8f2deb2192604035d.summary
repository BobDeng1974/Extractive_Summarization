@entity1 coach @entity0 has dismissed @entity2 and @entity3 from the club 's list of targets for this summer			1
the @entity7 has , however , been linked with @entity9 talisman @entity8 and the word out of @entity11 is that @entity12 would be willing to listen to offers of £ 10million for the 29 - year - old midfielder			1
@entity8 , whose name cropped up during @entity17 's tenure at @entity1 , is also interested in a new challenge			2
also in @entity26 's thinking is the @entity7 contingent of @entity37 right back @entity38 , centre back @entity40 and the versatile @entity42 defender @entity41			1
a deal for @entity45 's @entity44 remains on the cards once he proves he is recuperating well from his knee ligament injury			2
meanwhile , @entity48 has admitted to becoming frustrated by his failure to hold down a first - team place up front for @entity1			0
the @entity53 forward wants a central role for club and country to prove he can score goals regularly at the highest level			0
up in the air : @entity60 could be on his way out of the @entity63 this summer after failing to impress @entity7 legion : @entity26 is eyeing @entity65 defender @entity38 ( left ) at @entity1 options open : @entity45 's @entity44 remains a firm favourite within @entity68 this summer play me through the middle ! @entity48 has admitted his frustration at @entity68 last season @entity48 has scored eight times in 21 appearances for the national team but spent most of the season struggling for form at @entity1 under @entity17			1
‘ it does get frustrating , ’ said the 23 - year - old			0
‘ you want to be playing in a certain position and you ’re not getting the opportunity to do that			0
‘ for @entity1 i ’m more likely to be left wing of a four - man midfield with only two centre midfielders so it ’s a bit more difficult for me to make runs to score when i ’ve got to think about my defensive duties as well			0

@entity26 has his own targets and is *n't* *bothered* about @entity2 or @entity3
@entity9 's @entity8 is looking for a new challenge
@entity12 would listen to offers for the @entity96 midfielder
@entity45 's @entity44 is still in the thoughts of @entity1
club still looking at @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41
