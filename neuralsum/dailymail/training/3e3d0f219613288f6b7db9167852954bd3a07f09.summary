in a quiet corner of north west @entity2 , @entity0 is finalising his preparations for his heavyweight rematch with @entity5			1
@entity0 spends 45 minutes training in front of the watching media , looking considerably slimmer than the man who lost to fury three years ago			1
in the background , the dulcet tones of the @entity10 provide a rather sharp contrast to a man intent on causing destruction			0
one on hand , he gave @entity32 a torrid time over 12 rounds in february in 2012			0
but an hour later he was involved in a disgraceful brawl with @entity36 at the post-fight press conference			0
fury may be ordered to shave off his beard ahead of the fight on saturday night fury is looking for a repeat of his win over @entity0 in 2011 when the two meet again on saturday since losing to @entity36 five months later , however , and after a heart - to - heart with his mum , @entity0 overhauled his training regime and put together a run of five consecutive victories			1
he has been preparing to take on @entity5 at a training camp near @entity19 in @entity17 , where he was pictured going shooting last week			1
@entity0 appeared in good spirits , and seemed relaxed at one of @entity17 's most picturesque surroundings			2

' i 'm in a better place than the first fight , ' he said			0
' i 'm more mature and more experienced			2
i 'm a dad now and there 's nothing better in the world than being a dad			0
' i 've been working on being more mobile and i want to get the fight rolling			0
' the way i 've got this fight planned out , by round seven he 'll be 5ft 5in			0
@entity5 ( right ) throws a punch in the ring in the match where he beat @entity0 ( left ) three years ago ' i 'm in my prime ; heavyweights peak in their 30s and that 's what 's happening to me now			1
' it 's going to be a great fight			0
