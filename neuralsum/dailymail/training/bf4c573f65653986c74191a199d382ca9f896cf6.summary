by @entity0 women trying to donate to @entity2 as part of the # nomakeupselfie craze have found themselves accidentally trying to adopt a polar bear , it was revealed today			1
the fault has been happening when some givers ' smartphones autocorrect the word ‘ beat ’ to read ‘ bear ’ and end up sending a message of interest in adoption to the @entity14			1
in addition , £ 18,625 donated during the craze has accidentally been sent to the @entity20 agency @entity19 by people texting ‘ donate ’ rather than ‘ beat ’ , followed by the number 70099			1
# nomakeupselfies : celebrities including models @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) have joined in with the craze , although it is not believed they made the donating mistake getting involved : @entity33 singer @entity32 , whose mother has cancer , posted a no make - up selfie ' i woke up like dis ' : @entity39 joined the trend by posting a picture of herself on @entity42 , despite appearing to be wearing a hint of eye make - up in the snap and not including the hashtag # nomakeupselfie tens of thousands of women have taken to posting photos of their make - up free faces online , alongside a £ 3 donation , which has helped raise more than £ 8million for the cancer charity			2
and @entity19 is now working with @entity2 to transfer the mistakenly - donated funds , while the @entity14 said no money was taken from people who had enquired about adoption by mistake			1
a @entity19 @entity60 spokesman told @entity61 : ‘ @entity19 is not responsible for this error , however we 've been working hard to find a resolution to the situation for those affected			2
‘ " donate to 70099 " is an sms keyword and shortcode combination that @entity19 have sole use of , specifically for any members of the public who contact us and wish to donate to us via sms			1
’ the @entity14 stated any texts accidentally it received would not become donations helping to protect polar bears , because the charity has ‘ human operators calling people back to confirm adoptions ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we wish @entity2 every success in their campaign and their goals			0
polar bear selfies are harder to come by , though , as far as we are aware , none wear make - up			1
’ mistake : some people have even made an enquiry about adopting a polar bear from the @entity14 , after their smartphones autocorrected the word ' beat ' to read ' bear ' reasoning : @entity97 says it 's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can nobody seems to know when it started or why , but the take - up of the # nomakeupselfie craze has been astonishing , perhaps even more so as it was a trend that was not started by the charity			1
celebrities such as models @entity27 and @entity28 and singer @entity109 have joined in			0
the craze was not orchestrated by @entity2 , but it quickly uploaded its own make - up - free selfie of a staff member holding a sign reading : ‘ this campaign is n’t ours but every £ helps			2
’ in the 24 hours after it posted that photo , 800,000 donations were made and £ 1million raised			0
some men have also followed suit with their own versions , posting pictures of their faces in make - up			0
however , some @entity126 and @entity127 users have reacted angrily to the trend , with one user writing : ‘ because not wearing make - up is like ...			0
having cancer ? i hope i ’m missing the point here			0
’ @entity134 , @entity2 's director of communications , said : ‘ we 're really grateful to everyone who donated to @entity2 through the # nomakeupselfie campaign			0
online postings : @entity138 , left , put her no makeup selfie on @entity127 , as did @entity141 on the right uploaded : @entity2 , while not affiliated with the # nomakeupselfie hashtag , is supporting it ‘ we 've agreed with @entity19 that the donations they received will be given to @entity2			2
people who made a donation in error to @entity19 have already been contacted to let them know the money is being transferred			1
’ @entity152 superstars @entity151 and @entity153 , @entity60 model @entity154 and x factor judge @entity39 are also among those to take part in the craze			0
' we wish @entity2 every success in their campaign and their goals			0
polar bear selfies are harder to come by , though , as far as we are aware , none wear make - up ' @entity14 spokesman @entity2 said the donations will allow the charity to carry out 10 clinical trials which it did not have money to fully fund last week			1
@entity170 , chief executive of @entity2 , said : ‘ we 've been overwhelmed by the support people have been showing us through the # nomakeupselfie trend			0
‘ we do n't receive any government funding for our research and so it 's phenomenal to think that the generosity of the public is enabling us to fund critical research that we did n't have the money for six days ago			2
‘ being able to fund more trials will bring forward the day when all cancers are cured			0
it 's been an exciting week , and we 'd just like to thank everyone again for their support			0
’ @entity2 wants people to text beat to 70099 to donate £ 3 or visit @entity189 .			1

some people 's smartphones autocorrected the word ' beat ' to ' bear '
this has seen them make enquiry about adopting polar bear from @entity14
money sent by those texting ' donate ' instead of ' beat ' goes to @entity19
mistakes have led to the @entity20 agency receiving £ 18,625 so far
