a woman in her 50s will give birth to her own children after becoming a surrogate mother for her infertile daughter			1
@entity6 , 58 , is six months pregnant and will welcome her seventh grandchild into the world when she gives birth to her - before daughter @entity10 raises the baby			1
mrs @entity10 and her husband @entity12 had been trying for two years when they discovered they could n’t conceive due to scarring in her uterus			1
so mrs @entity6 mother of three and a grandmother of six , volunteered to be a surrogate mother for her daughter			1
@entity6 ( red top ) is six months pregnant with her own grandchild			1
her daughter @entity22 ca n't have children due to scarring on her uterus mrs @entity10 said : ' the day i came home from my surgery mum said " i 'll do it "			1
' mrs @entity6 , from @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , said : ' i felt bad for them - i just thought what ’s nine months of my life ? they are going to have a child for the rest of theirs ? it 's not like i 'm busy doing anything			2
' @entity40 , specialist at the @entity41 , says though there have been cases of mothers acting as surrogate for their daughters before it is typically something the medical community does not advise			2
he said : ' usually it ’s a close friend or a sister that acts as the gestational carrier - women who are over 45 - years - old are not normally in good enough health			2
' pregnancy for older women is much riskier			0
the most common complications are high blood pressure , gestational diabetes and premature child birth			0
' but they were risks mrs @entity6 was willing to accept and while she admits her pregnancy has n’t been easy , she has had no complications so far			1
' it was long process and involved a heavy dose of fertility drugs for both of us but in the end it all paid off			0
' i was standing in line for a coffee when i got a call from my doctor confirming i was pregnant			2
i was just bawling - people must have thought someone close to me died			0
' but it has been challenging			0
now i ’m showing i make sure people are n’t staring or looking at me because they ’re probably thinking ‘ look at that old lady			0
' mrs @entity6 said she did question whether she was doing the right thing and if everything would work out okay until she started to feel the baby move			1
now her only concerns are about how she will feel once she has given birth			2
' i do n't know if i 'll feel like i 've lost her , i do n't know how i 'm going to feel , ' mrs @entity6 said			1
@entity22 plans to name her daughter @entity89 after her mother			1
and for her the whole experience has made her cherish their mother - daughter relationship even more			0
she said : ' it just changes your relationship 360 degrees			0
we were close before but it ’s just on a whole new level			0
i want to be like she is to my own daughter , that caring and willing to do stuff for her			0
