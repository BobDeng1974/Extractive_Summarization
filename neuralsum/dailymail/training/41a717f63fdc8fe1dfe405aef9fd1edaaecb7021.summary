two drunk teenagers have been filmed attacking staff in a @entity2 with foam tubes			1
a 90 - second clip , which has clocked up more than 12,000 views on @entity6 , shows @entity7 and @entity8 hitting two female employees before being chased out of the fast food restaurant			1
the video , which was recorded by one of their friends has gone viral , being shared by 8,000 people , and prompting over 3,000 comments			1
but the unrepentant teens from @entity18 in @entity19 have refused to apologise for their behaviour despite police confirming they were investigating reports of an assault			1
@entity7 , an apprentice electrician , said the trio had visited the @entity18 branch of @entity2 last weekend at 7am after spending all night on a drinking binge			1
he admitted to being drunk in the video but claimed the member of staff ‘ over-reacted ’ when she was hit			1
the 18 - year - old said : ' we had more than a few			0
on the way up to @entity45 ’s we found some scaffolding safety foam and thought it 'd be funny to have a fight with them and it just carried on in @entity45 ’s			2
' we thought we 'd involve the staff but i do n't think they were too impressed			2
' the video shows mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 , a promising young footballer , enter the store brandishing the foam , first accosting a customer who is leaving the restaurant			1
he is heard to tell them to : ' turn round and go and get yourselves some @entity62			0
' the lads then wrestle with each other on the floor and a voice off camera can be heard saying : ' these @entity45 ’s staff are mugging you off			2
' they then turn their attention to the staff and attempt to go behind the counter but are stopped by two female employees			1
one woman is hit on the head by mr @entity8 , and is then struck again between her legs			1
she tells them : ' do n’t be hitting me with that again			2
get out , ' before ordering them to stop filming without permission			0
the two continue to brandish their foam tubes while the employee shouts at them eventually , the woman manages to chase the pranksters out of the restaurant - with them running away she then chases them out onto the street and is clearly heard shouting : ' leave the fu * * ing store now			1
' the unnamed staff member continues to remonstrate with the teenagers outside while they carry on hitting her with the foam			1
another employee is heard calling the police before the clip ends asked if he wished to apologise , mr @entity7 said : ' not even a tiny bit			1
it was harmless fun and nobody got hurt so i do n't think i should feel bad			0
' he added : ' she threatened us back so we ’re equal			0
' mr @entity8 , who is a footballer with @entity111 side @entity110 , and an apprentice bricklayer described the episode as ‘ a piece of fun ’			1
the 19 year old said : ' i wo n’t apologise			0
we were just messing about			0
i think she over-reacted if anything			0
there was no need for her to get on like she did			0
' the police spoke to us outside and just sent us on our way			2
' the reaction to the pair ’s antics have had a mixed reaction online			0
@entity130 posted : ' talk about immature , you want to grow up ! ' the woman even chases the pair - still holding on to the cylinders - out of the restaurant and down the street and @entity137 added : ' if our police force is any good these two idiots will be arrested for threatening behaviour			1
@entity143 said : ' so immature the girl is only trying to earn some money do n't deserve that abuse			0
then again she could have just laughed it off ' other @entity6 users found the incident harmless and said the language used by the staff member was n’t acceptable @entity152 wrote : ' calm down , they are just having fun , not hurting anyone			2
' @entity155 posted : ' language from the staff is terrible , ' and @entity158 said : ' really badly handled by the staff			2
they were n't doing that much harm why the over reaction ? ? ' @entity18 business leader @entity163 said the prank , which targeted staff as they worked , was ‘ abhorrent ’			1
mr @entity163 , president of @entity167 , said : ' it ’s ludicrous			2
i find it absolutely abhorrent that people think this is ok			0
' unfortunately , what seems like a bit of a laugh with alcohol on board is n’t nice for those on the receiving end			0
@entity7 , left , and @entity8 , right , admitted being drunk in the video - but said the member of staff ' over-reacted ' when they hit her			1
police confirmed they were investigating the assault ' clearly it ’s the alcohol that is the problem in this case			1
even if it was intended as a bit of fun , it can be extremely intimidating for the staff			2
' i absolutely condemn this behaviour			0
i would question why these drunken idiots even need to be out at 7am			0
' @entity18 mp @entity194 said : ' it might be fun for them but it certainly is n’t for the people on the receiving end			1
' you expect people to treat the staff with the respect they deserve			2
if the staff had reacted , they would have got the sack so why do these lads think this is acceptable ? ' they are purely doing their job			1
nobody goes to work to be attacked			0
' coun @entity213 , for the @entity209 with @entity211 ward where the incident happened , said : ' i would n’t tolerate that either if i was a member of staff and it happened to me			2
i would feel aggrieved and people should n’t have to put up with it at work			0
' filming this sort of thing and putting it on @entity6 seems to be some sort of craze at the moment and it is n’t good			0
it might be harmless fun to those that are doing it but it is not to the victim			0
' i hope the police take a harsh approach to it and send a message out			0
' police confirmed they were investigating the incident , which happened at 6.55am last saturday , but said that no arrests had been made			1
a spokeswoman for @entity45 ’s said : ' we can confirm that an incident took place and the police were contacted			0
