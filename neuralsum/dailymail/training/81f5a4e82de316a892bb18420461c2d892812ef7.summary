by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:08 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:13 est , 19 december 2013 when @entity4 quit his job teaching @entity6 in @entity7 , he could have hopped on a flight and been back home in @entity10 the next day			1
instead the 29 - year - old decided to cycle the 6,000 miles back despite never owning a bike before			1
mr @entity4 set off on march 26 but only arrived home on sunday after 265 days on the road pedalling across @entity16 , the @entity17 , and @entity18			1
@entity4 , 29 , has spent the last 265 days cycling 6,000 miles home from @entity7 to @entity10 half way round the world : mr @entity4 cycled from @entity22 to @entity10 via @entity23 , the @entity17 , and @entity18 on his trip mr @entity4 tackled temperatures of @entity26 ( @entity27 ) in @entity28 , dodged bombs in @entity30 , and suffered through snow in @entity32			1
he said : ' it was a very exhausting last leg			2
it was colder and darker and rainier and that pushed me on to get it finished			0
' @entity32 was beautiful , the scenery was nice and there was some snow , but i am glad to be finished			0
i will probably never experience anything like that again			0
i 've met so many interesting people			0
mr @entity4 's journey took him 3,000 miles across the width of @entity16			1
he is pictured here between the central city of @entity48 and the @entity50 province @entity51 for much of the route mr @entity4 followed the @entity53 which connects @entity17 and @entity16 ' i wanted to find a more interesting way of travelling back from @entity7			1
i just started looking at different blogs of ways people had got back and saw that			2
' i was n't much of a cyclist and did n't know much about bikes , i sort of learned along the way			0
i 'm really glad i chose to go home that way , it was a great way to travel			2
' @entity4 added that he had received an early @entity66 present on his return , meeting his seven - month - old nephew @entity68 , who was born while he was away			1
after tackling the sandy deserts of @entity70 mr @entity4 crossed the border into @entity72 the teacher says he often relied on the kindness of locals - including these people from @entity28 - who gave him a place to sleep and wash while often struggling to support themselves mr @entity4 says he had to wait two months before being allowed into @entity78 and almost cancelled the trip once he was allowed in mr @entity80 continued his journey across the country , stopping to visit @entity83 @entity4 's trip saw him ride 3,000 miles across @entity16 , cross over into @entity72 , then travel through @entity85 and @entity28 before heading on to @entity78			1
he said : ' it was very hot in that region			0
in @entity28 in particular , where it was 50 degrees , even the local people were saying it was unnaturally hot			0
' it was too hot to cycle in the day , so i would find somewhere cool to rest and continued with my journey at night			2
' the temperatures in @entity78 ( pictured ) were high , but not as high as @entity28 where they reached @entity26 from @entity78 mr @entity4 made his way into @entity30 where he captured this stunning sunset while crossing @entity30 mr @entity4 had to make a detour after five bombs which off in @entity30 - @entity102 capital @entity103 along the way punctured tyres were a constant problem for mr @entity4 , who is an amateur cyclist just 192 days into his cycle , in @entity30 , @entity4 was forced to make a last - minute change to his plans when five bombs exploded in the usually safe @entity30 - @entity102 capital of @entity103			1
after that he headed on to @entity111 , before crossing the border into @entity18 and taking on @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity32 and @entity117			1
@entity4 said the lowest point of the trip was having to wait for two months to get a visa to enter @entity78 , which was the only time he considered giving up with his journey			2
' it was all about achieving the mile stones , once i crossed @entity16 , which was by far the longest part of my journey i knew i could do the rest			2
' but waiting for my visas was awful			0
i did n't know if i could move forward or not			0
the @entity78 visa took so long but it came through eventually			0
' from @entity30 mr @entity4 travelled into @entity111 where he captured this remarkable image of a tree while on his way through @entity111 mr @entity4 passed through @entity134 in the @entity135 , one of the oldest continuously occupied cities on the planet he says his journey was ' one of the best experiences of my life ' and says he has no regrets about choosing an unorthodox way home			1
here he is pictured in @entity111 for most of the trip he camped in tents by the side of the road - such as here in @entity111 when he was n't cycling mr @entity4 spent his time camping on the side of the road and in the occasional hotel , but also found families to take him in			1
he said he was impressed by the small acts of kindness he experienced on the way , often from people who could n't afford to help themselves			0
' it was such a relief and it restores your faith in humanity when there 's so many people prepared to help you along the way , ' he said			0
throughout the trip border checks held him up			0
here mr @entity4 crosses into @entity114 from @entity113 he could have just hopped on a 12 hour flight from @entity22 to @entity169 , but instead mr @entity4 chose to spend 265 cycling across two continents			1
here he is crossing @entity114 mr @entity4 called the scenery in @entity32 was stunning but said the cold weather made him want to finish back at last : mr @entity4 passes through @entity174 on the penultimate day of his nine - month trip ' i 've met so many hospitable people and in countries you might not expect them to be hospitable			1
it was really good just to meet lots of really nice people who would just let you stay with them for nothing			0
' mr @entity4 's return was celebrated by a party thrown by his friends and family and he said he now plans to use his break to sleep before applying for a masters degree in international development			2
the trip has raised more than Â £ 1,400 for the @entity195 charity , which clears landmines and bombs in countries affected by conflict .			0
