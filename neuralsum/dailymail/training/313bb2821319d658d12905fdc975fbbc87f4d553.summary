by @entity0 the ' @entity1 ' was drawn up after the case @entity3 , ten , who drowned in @entity4 after rescuing his sister have - a - go - heroes are to be given special protection from prosecution or legal action under a radical ‘ @entity1 ’ being drawn up by ministers			1
@entity12 wants to protect emergency workers and the public from legal consequences if they intervene in good faith to help someone in difficulty , the @entity11 has learned			1
similar legislation operates in @entity20 where it has reduced the potential for negligence claims against doctors , police and firefighters , as well as ordinary members of the public			0
a form of the @entity1 law is expected to be a centrepiece of next week ’s @entity31 , which will set out the @entity33 ’s plans for the last year before the @entity34			1
the purpose of the law is to prevent people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in a rescue attempt or treatment			1
‘ it ’s about protecting people who act in a heroic fashion			1
that could include emergency workers , but really it is about anyone who is trying to do the right thing , ’ said a well - placed source			0
the prime minister has said the fear of transgressing @entity54 and @entity56 rules sometimes means people ‘ stand aside when others need help ’			1
ministers point to the case of ten - year - old @entity3 in september 2007 , who drowned in a pond in @entity4 having rescued his young sister after community support officers were told not to intervene as they had not undertaken water rescue health and safety training			1
and in the inquests into the july 7 bombings in @entity69 , evidence emerged that a number of victims remained alive long after three bombs were detonated on the @entity73 in 2005			0
though it was concluded none could have been saved , the inquest heard some were left to die in pain because of health and safety protocols which left firemen unable to rush in to rescue them			2
paramedics were also alleged to have been prevented from helping victims of @entity84 gunman @entity83 ’s shooting spree in 2010 because health and safety policies meant police held back ambulance crews and rescue helicopters until every shooting scene was cleared			2
@entity91 , who was @entity92 ’s trade secretary , drew up a report for the government recommending health and safety law is reined in and @entity96 given reassurance in law			2
‘ if a fireman or a policeman commits an act of heroism in the course of his duty , he can be prosecuted for endangering himself , ’ @entity91 told the @entity11 when his recommendations were published			2
‘ we all know stories of policemen standing by when people have got into trouble , and have been backed up by their superiors for not putting themselves in danger			2
it ’s a corrosive thing			0
people believe they must n’t do something they want to do			0
’ ordinary citizens who are trying to help others in @entity1 situations must also be reassured that they can not be sued , he said			0
‘ we have to make it completely clear to people , if you clear the snow in front of your house , if you stop to do anything to help somebody , you are not liable , ’ @entity91 said			0
@entity3 jumped into the pond , pictured above , after police community support officers were told not to intervene over fear of legal consequences - because they had not undertaken water rescue health and safety training while most people are not so ungrateful to sue someone who tried to help them and administered first aid , increasing numbers of court cases have been brought against @entity96			1
specialist insurance is available to healthcare workers to guard against civil claims brought against what is argued to be medical malpractice – incorrectly administering a procedure , or negligence – in situations where they were doing their best to help			0
as well as @entity20 , many other countries protect emergency workers and members of the public from being pursued in the courts when they have tried to assist someone in good faith			1
in @entity157 , there is a specific obligation on citizens to help others in distress , and they risk prosecution if they do not			0
while in @entity163 , any rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress is legally protected from being successfully sued for ‘ wrongdoing ’ .			0
