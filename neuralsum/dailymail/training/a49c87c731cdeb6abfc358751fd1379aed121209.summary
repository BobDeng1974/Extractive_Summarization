care fears : nearly a third of doctors say their patients are being put at risk in @entity6 hospitals because of poor standards ( picture posed by models ) one in ten thinks that in the past 12 months at least one of their patients died unnecessarily because the hospital either misdiagnosed them or they were not given the correct treatment			1
the poll exposes a widespread lack of faith in @entity6 hospitals			0
more than one in five ( 21 per cent ) believe the care at their nearest hospital is so dire they would not want to be treated there themselves – and they would not send in their relatives			1
one family doctor in the @entity37 said that when his wife recently went to hospital there was ‘ no appreciation of the human side to her care ’			2
‘ she was in a tunnel where she went in one side and came out the other as if on a factory production line , ’ he said			0
another unnamed gp in @entity51 said that in the local hospital he was aware of ‘ patients not being fed , not being washed , the sort of care that none of us would want ourselves or for our patients ’			1
one from @entity60 , @entity61 , said he had written to the chief executive of @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 telling her care was so bad that if he had his way he ‘ would not refer a single patient ’			2
some 34 per cent of doctors said that in the past 12 months at least one of their patients had been subject to hospital care that was ‘ dangerously sub-standard ’			1

@entity129 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ that so many gps do not have faith in their local hospital is deeply concerning			1
these results should not be swept under the carpet			0
’ dr @entity135 , of the @entity137 ’s gps committee , said doctors should raise issues directly with the hospital concerned , adding : ‘ if we want the best care we must not stay silent when issues arise			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity144 said the poll only represented a ‘ small proportion ’ of the 40,000 gps in the country			0
