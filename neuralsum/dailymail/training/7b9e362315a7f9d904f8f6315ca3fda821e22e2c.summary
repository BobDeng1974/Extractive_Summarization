@entity0 : @entity2 - @entity1 broke into a young woman 's house before beating and raping her a convicted @entity6 rapist brutally attacked a young woman in her own home within weeks of arriving in @entity9			1
@entity2 - @entity10 , 20 , fled to the @entity9 after judges released him three years into a prison sentence for a horrific rape and three robberies in his home country			1
less than three months after arriving in @entity9 , he broke into the woman ’s home in the early hours and throttled her until she was unconscious			1
when she awoke , she begged him to take her money but he refused , flashing a knife at her , battering her with a spade and subjecting her to a violent rape			2
jailing him for 15 years yesterday , a judge branded @entity1 a rapist ‘ of the most extreme nature ’			1
the girl ’s friends , meanwhile , said she stopped feeling safe in the @entity9 and had emigrated for fear of further attacks			2
and @entity30 demanded to know why a criminal with such an ‘ appalling ’ history of violence was ever allowed into the country			1
@entity1 , a drink and drug abuser , was jailed as a minor in @entity6 in 2009 after he raped a woman in his home town @entity40 , 125 miles north of @entity41 , when he was 16			1
because he was so young , he was sentenced to serve just four - and - a - half years for the sexual assault and three robberies and was granted a conditional release after serving two thirds of his sentence			1
border controls have effectively been eroded by free movement directives issued by @entity50 , which mean @entity9 must open its doors to people from other @entity54 countries , even convicted criminals			1
anyone coming to the @entity9 from outside the @entity54 faces stringent tests and must apply for a visa , giving details of their criminal history			1
when it comes to most of those arriving from inside the @entity54 , however , the @entity62 has no way of knowing their criminal record			2
they are checked against a range of watch - lists – which include suspected terrorists , those wanted by police , certain sex offenders , and people excluded from the @entity9			1
but @entity9 police rely on other countries to provide them with the details			2
the system breaks down when the offender ’s home country does not come forward with this information			1
cynically , foreign countries within the @entity54 may even withhold information because they would rather their murderers were in the @entity9 than at home			1
if they are not informed , @entity9 police have no way of checking a foreigner ’s criminal convictions			2
but none of the conditions barred @entity1 from travelling abroad and within weeks he moved to @entity9 , where his conviction was not flagged up			2
less than three months later , on february 1 this year , he broke into a house in @entity93 by climbing through a bathroom window			2
the victim , 24 , awoke at around 7am to find him standing over her bed clutching a shovel			0
she saw a knife by the bed before he reached down and throttled her			0
she lost consciousness and he waited for her to come back around , when she begged him to take her money and her laptop and leave			0
instead , he raped her and when she tried to scream , he attacked her with the spade , leaving her face and hair soaked in blood			0
he was eventually caught after the girl ’s best friend and housemate heard a commotion and walked in to see @entity1 holding the spade			0
‘ i thought [ my friend ] was out for the night			0
i opened the door and saw the guy			0
everything was in a big mess and he was holding a shovel , ’ she said			0
‘ i could n’t see [ my friend ] so i thought he was robbing the house			0
‘ i ran back to my room and locked it and he started banging on the door to make me afraid			0
i called the police and thought he would leave but he went back to [ my friend ’s ] room			0
’ @entity1 fled after officers arrived but was found nearby			0
jailed : @entity1 was sentenced to 15 years in prison at @entity129 and will be deported afterwards the @entity132 victim ’s friend only realised she had been attacked when she suddenly emerged from her room dazed and bloodied			1
she was naked but had covered herself with a bed sheet			0
the friend said : ‘ after she came home from the police and the hospital , she packed her things			0
within a fortnight she left for @entity141			0
she was so scared … everywhere that she turned there were reminders of what had happened			0
’ criticism : mp @entity146 hit out at @entity6 authorities claiming they did not inform the @entity9 that @entity1 had a serious conviction @entity1 was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault , burglary and rape despite claiming to have no memory of the attack , saying he had taken drugs and alcohol beforehand			1
he also admitted burgling a mosque in @entity93			2
on august 22 at @entity129 , he was given a sentence of 15 years , with 11 years to be served in custody and four years on licence			1
he will be deported after he serves his sentence			0
judge @entity162 said @entity1 was a rapist ‘ of the most extreme nature ’			0
‘ this has left the victim with permanent psychological scarring , ’ he said			0
addressing @entity1 , he added : ‘ what makes this case more disturbing is your young age and your previous convictions for rape and burglary in @entity6			2
’ @entity146 , mp for @entity175 , said : ‘ this is another appalling example of a person who has been permitted to enter the @entity9 despite the fact that his presence was against the public ’s interest			1
‘ the question needs to be asked why the @entity6 authorities did not inform the @entity9 that this person should not be permitted entry			1
’ the @entity186 said people travelling to the @entity9 were checked against a range of watch - lists but the onus for flagging someone ’s criminal history is with the authorities in their home country			1
‘ where we receive information that foreign nationals present a genuine threat to society , we are able to take action to prevent their entry to the @entity9 , ’ a spokesman added .			2

@entity2 - @entity10 , 20 , convicted of sex attack on woman in @entity93
entered @entity9 despite conviction for *similar* rape in @entity6 aged 16
sentenced to 15 years in prison and will then be deported
but mp calls *decision* to let him in the country in first place ' appalling '
onus for flagging @entity54 individual 's criminal history lies with home country
