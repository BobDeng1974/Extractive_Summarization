the priceless collection of 26 books , manuscripts and documents was unveiled yesterday at a news conference with church leaders that marks the latest example of the faith being more forthcoming about its history and tenets			1

' the religion founded with 30 followers now counts 15 million worldwide after experiencing a tripling of membership in the past three decades			2
as mormons became more prominent in @entity68 and questions emerged about the burgeoning faith , some criticized it as being secretive about its beliefs and practices			0
in recent years , the @entity12 - based church has taken concerted steps to change that image			1
a year ago , it began releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how @entity22 formed the church			1
a printing plate used in the creation of the @entity83 - one of founder @entity22 's doctrines a page from @entity86 - a text containing several five sections detailing the religion 's birth another page from @entity86 which purports to translate ancient records the religion also has issued a series of in - depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of its history that it once sidestepped , such as the faith 's past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy			1
the church 's website has become a treasure trove of information about its doctrine , gospel and practices			2
professor of literature and religion @entity112 said the new ' @entity32 ' exhibit , which opens to the public this week at the church 's @entity12 history library , is another illustration of the religion 's push to open its vault and take on questions			1
the collection should generate widespread interest among mormons who will be able to see , in person , the artifacts associated with keystone events in church history , he said			0
the items have been in the church vault , taken out from time to time to show , but they have never before been displayed in one collection			0

' there are questions that arise occasionally , and we need to deal with them in an honest , forthright way , which we are trying to do			0
' the document likely to draw the most interest is the page from the @entity4 , considered the religion 's most valuable manuscript			1
before he was killed by a mob in 1844 , mr @entity22 buried the entire manuscript in the cornerstone of a building under construction in @entity159 , @entity160 , the city @entity6 fled to in the mid- 1800s to avoid religious persecution			0

@entity195 , professor of mormon history and culture at @entity198 , equated the experience of seeing the documents to @entity68 viewing the @entity201 for the first time			0
