by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 14:10 est , 30 july 2013 @entity2 home prices jumped 12.2 per cent in may compared with a year ago , the biggest annual gain since march 2006			1
the increase shows the housing recovery is strengthening , despite home ownership slipping to an 18 year low			1
the @entity10 20 - city home price index released today also surged 2.4 per cent in may from april			1
cities included : @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity30 @entity29 , @entity31 @entity14 , @entity32 - 24.4 % @entity17 , @entity33 - 23.3 % @entity34 , @entity35 - 20.6 % @entity25 , @entity36 - 20.1 % @entity15 , @entity32 - 19.2 % @entity23 , @entity37 - 19.1 % @entity16 , @entity32 - 17.3 % @entity27 , @entity38 - 14.2 % @entity21 , @entity39 - 14.1 % @entity13 , @entity40 - 12.5 % @entity12 , @entity41 - 11.9 % @entity26 , @entity38 - 10.9 % @entity19 , @entity42 - 9.7 % @entity22 , @entity43 - 8.5 % @entity20 , @entity44 - 7.6 % @entity31 , @entity45 - 7.5 % @entity28 , @entity46 - 7.0 % @entity30 - 6.5 % @entity24 , @entity47 - 3.4 % @entity29 , @entity48 - 3.3 % the month - over - month gain nearly matched the 2.6 per cent increase in april from march - the highest on record			1
the price increases were widespread			0
all 20 cities showed gains in may from april and compared with a year ago			1
prices in @entity20 and @entity19 reached the highest level on records dating back to 2000			1
that marks the first time since the housing bust that any city has reached an all - time high			1
home values are rising as more people are bidding on a scarce supply of houses for sale			1
however , figures released today showed that home ownership is at its lowest since 1995			1
the seasonally adjusted home ownership rate , the share of households owning a home , slipped to 65.1 per cent , the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1995 , the @entity69 said on today			1
the rate , which peaked at 69.4 per cent in 2004 , was 65.2 per cent in the first quarter			0
@entity2 are still locked in a rental market , one of the lingering legacies of the recession			0
high unemployment , a shortage of homes for sale and stringent lending practices made renting more appealing , economists said , warning that the share of @entity2 owning a home would continue to drift lower			1
' there is a big shortage of homes and the amount of households and people that need to live somewhere is increasing , ' said @entity94 , an economist at @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97			0
' it 's difficult to buy a home , they have to look somewhere , so they are renting			2
' ownership among people between 55 and 64 fell 0.3 percentage point in the second quarter			0
but there were small gains in the 35 - 44 age range			2
another concern is that higher mortgage rates could also slow home sales			2
but many economists say rates remain low by historical standards and would need to rise much faster to halt the momentum			0
@entity115 , senior economist at @entity116 , a home price data provider , said a big reason for the recent price gains is that foreclosed homes make up a smaller proportion of overall sales			1
foreclosed homes are usually sold by banks at fire - sale prices			2
' typical home values have appreciated at roughly half this pace for the past several months , which is still very robust , ' @entity115 said			2
@entity115 said higher mortgage rates and a likely increase in the number of homes for sale in the coming months should slow the pace of price gains and stabilize the housing market			2
the index covers roughly half of @entity2 homes			0
it measures prices compared with those in january 2000 and creates a three - month moving average			1
the may figures are the latest available			0
they are not adjusted for seasonal variations , so the monthly gains reflect more buying activity over the summer			2
despite the recent gains , home prices are still about 25 per cent below the peaks they reached in july 2006			1
that 's a key reason the supply of homes for sale remains low , as many homeowners are waiting to recoup their losses before putting their houses on the market			0
@entity20 and @entity19 , the two cities that reached record highs , were not hit hard by the housing bust and therefore did n't experience the sharp price swings like cities in @entity33 , @entity35 , @entity32 and @entity38			1
in @entity20 , prices fell only 11.2 per cent from their previous peak in june 2007 through february 2009			1
that 's far less than @entity17 , where prices plummeted by more than half			2
since bottoming out , home prices in @entity20 have increased nearly 14 per cent			1
in @entity19 , prices dropped 14.3 per cent from august 2006 until they also hit bottom in february 2009			1
since then , they have risen 17.3 percent			0
@entity2 home prices are still about 25 per cent below the peaks they reached in july 2006 the biggest price gains are occurring in many of the states that experienced the worst housing bust			1
prices jumped 24.5 per cent in @entity14 in may from a year earlier , the largest increase			2
@entity17 reported the next biggest gain at 23.3 per cent , followed by @entity34 at 20.6 per cent			0
all three remain well below their peak prices			2
the smallest yearly gains were in @entity29 , at 3.3 per cent , followed by @entity24 with 3.4 percent and @entity30 at 6.5 per cent			1
higher home prices help the economy in several ways			1
they encourage more sellers to put their homes on the market , boosting supply and sustaining the housing recovery			0
and they make homeowners feel wealthier , encouraging consumers to spend more			0
banks are also more willing to provide mortgage loans when homes are appreciating in value			0
mortgage rates have surged since early may , though the increase would have had little impact on the current report			0
the average rate on a 30 - year fixed mortgage has jumped a full percentage point since early may and reached a two - year high of 4.51 percent in late june			0
mortgage rates jumped after chairman @entity210 said the @entity211 could slow its bond - buying program later this year if the economy continues to improve			0
the @entity211 's bond purchases have kept long - term interest rates low , encouraging more borrowing and spending			0
in recent weeks , @entity210 and other @entity211 members have stressed that any change in the bond - buying program will depend on the economy 's health , not a set calendar date			0
since those comments , interest rates have declined			0
the average on the 30 - year mortgage was 4.31 percent last week			0
the @entity211 begins a two - day policy meeting today and could clarify its remarks further when the meeting concludes on wednesday .			0
