if you have children that you love and a home that you built together and a future that you planned — why would you give that up just for sex ? ’ mr @entity15 came up with the idea for the extra-marital dating site in the 1990s , after a career as a sports attorney apparently made him realise how much time and money his clients spent on mistresses while they were away on tour			1
the site has made him a self - made multi-millionaire and he claims it is worth at least £ 669million ( $ 1 billion )			2

‘ what i get is a lot of people who come back to me and say : ' listen , this has made me a better partner			2
' ‘ they were angry and taking things out on their family			0
the sexual frustration they were feeling , they start having the affair and all of a sudden , that stress is removed			0
it 's very cathartic for those people			2
‘ if you come home and you 've had an affair earlier in the day , it might be easier not to be frustrated with your partner			0
