@entity0 , comfortably the best spinner in the world before he was banned for chucking , could complete a remarkable comeback with a @entity5 call - up			1
@entity0 was cleared by the @entity6 on saturday after remedial work on his suspect bowling action and could now be fast - tracked into the @entity10 squad if they need to replace an injured player			1
@entity16 , himself banned from bowling in the @entity6 purge on illegal actions , has a foot problem has been ruled out so @entity10 will consider a return for a controversial cricketer who would find himself under the microscope here			1
@entity0 , seen here at the @entity21 in @entity22 , could be called up for the @entity5 after the @entity6 was satisfied he has remodelled his suspect bowling action @entity0 was banned by the @entity6 last year for his illegal bowling action ‘ there are a lot of ifs and buts because he has n’t played any cricket but let ’s see how things go in the next week , ’ said @entity10 captain @entity24			1
‘ he ’s been bowling a lot of deliveries in the nets every day but we have n’t sat down and talked about it yet			0
let ’s see what he has to do			0
’ it remains to be seen whether @entity0 , at 37 , can be as effective with a remodelled action and being under constant scrutiny from umpires who would be allowed to call or report him if they felt he transgressed again			2
but the possibility of his call - up is intriguing			2
without @entity0 and @entity16 they are short of quality spin and there is no doubt that he would strengthen a side looking to repeat their @entity5 win in @entity53 23 years ago			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) could be called up into the @entity10 squad as @entity16 is ruled out through injury @entity16 , seen here in action against @entity58 last week , has been ruled out with a foot injury ‘ the major concern for us and him is his lack of competitive cricket for the last five or six months , ’ said @entity24 here in @entity61 ahead of this week ’s @entity5 warm - up games			1
‘ it ’s a tough decision			0
’ for now the familiar figure of @entity70 , better known for his explosive hitting , will have to step up as @entity10 ’s main spinner in his fifth @entity5 , a challenge he is relishing			2
‘ for the last few years myself , @entity0 and @entity77 have done well as a bowling unit and the pressure will be on me now because the other two are not with me , ’ said @entity70 , who will face @entity75 at the @entity76 on wednesday			2
‘ but i ’m enjoying my bowling			0
i have played a lot of cricket for @entity10 but i have a big responsibility in this tournament as a senior player			0
this is not the time to give up			0
this is the time to give something to my country			0
