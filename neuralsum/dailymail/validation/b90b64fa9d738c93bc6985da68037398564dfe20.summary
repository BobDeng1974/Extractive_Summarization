a little - known southern pizza chain is edging in on big name brands to take a big slice of the market			0
@entity4 provides gas stations and convenience stores with ingredients and start up equipment but does n't charge franchise fees			1
as a result it now boasts more @entity13 sites than either @entity14 's or @entity15 , with 7,300 locations in 28 states			1
as well as the convenience factor , customers apparently love the taste			1
' it 's just got more flavor			0
it seems like , with the others , you 're getting cardboard			0
' while @entity4 may be unknown in many households , it runs television ads during @entity45 races and cable outdoors shows			1
for several years , it has sponsored @entity48 , who won the 2014 @entity49			0
on a recent morning at 10:40am , @entity23 , who owns @entity24 in @entity28 , @entity29 , started sliding @entity4 pizzas for the lunch rush into a conveyor - belt oven			1
easy - to - make : each pie starts out frozen , a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese build your own : employees can add fresh pepperoni , extra cheese and other toppings tasty treat : the result after about five minutes in the 525 - degree oven is a bubbling - hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains ' pizzas each pie starts out frozen , a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese			0

the result after about five minutes in the 525 - degree oven is a bubbling - hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains ' pizzas			0
in about an hour , @entity23 sold that first pizza and another one in two - slice $ 2.99 ' hunks ' from a countertop warming display near his cash register			0
pizza customers included a @entity86 delivery driver , a woman on her way to lunch with her daughter and a guy in camouflage who confessed he was just coming from the liquor store			2
in a typical @entity4 arrangement , @entity23 said he paid about $ 10,000 for his oven , freezer , display case and other equipment and now just pays the @entity99 , @entity29 - based company for the pizza ingredients			1
@entity4 , which is privately owned , fine - tuned this approach starting in the early 1990s when four brothers who 'd worked separately in the restaurant industry joined forces to sell pizzas to convenience stores			1
@entity4 had 750 locations by 1994 , said @entity108 , its vice president for marketing			1
' convenience stores in rural areas were the hub , ' @entity108 said in a phone interview			1
' a lot of people coming and going			0
and a lot of these smaller towns , they did n't really have a lot of other restaurants or other places to eat			2
' @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity29 and @entity123 each have more than 700 locations , @entity108 said			2
not all locations are isolated , with @entity4 also found at busy highway interchanges			1
and it 's moved into some urban areas , such as @entity128			0
the convenience store model is different from a free - standing restaurant , and a @entity4 outlet is likely to bring in far less than the more than $ 700,000 an average @entity14 's makes a year , said @entity132 , a restaurant industry analyst with @entity133			1
speedy delivery : @entity135 hands a @entity4 from the drive - thru window to a customer at the @entity24 in @entity28 pit stop : in a typical @entity4 arrangement , outlets pay about $ 10,000 for an oven , freezer , display case and other equipment - they then just pay the @entity99 , @entity29 - based company for the pizza ingredients @entity132 noted that @entity147 offers pizza in some of its 7,800 @entity13 locations and that @entity151 has also had success in rural areas			1
while @entity4 declined to discuss company finances , @entity23 says he sells about 500 pizzas a month , much of it by the hunk			1
combined with drinks and other convenience items , he estimates pizza customers spend more than $ 10,000 each month in his store			2
@entity132 says the simplicity of the setup has helped the company grow			0
' in a convenience store , you 're doing the register , you 're doing gas			2
you 're doing so many different things , ' @entity23 said			0
' it 's hard to be able to do pizza from the ground up , making the dough and the whole thing			0
' @entity174 , a food vendor at a furniture factory about 30 miles east of @entity28 , added a @entity4 to his lunch counter about a year ago to keep his customers from looking elsewhere for their pizza fix			1
' the problem i had was all these other places were delivering pizza , so i had to come up with something , ' he said while stopping at @entity185 to chat with @entity23			0
@entity186 came in to get three hunks of pepperoni pizza and drinks to take to lunch with her daughter			0
the 35 - year - old @entity28 resident said she buys @entity4 about twice a week			2
