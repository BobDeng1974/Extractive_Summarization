@entity63 , a charity worker from @entity14 , was trekking on @entity25 , @entity6 , when he vanished ' we 've been hugely heartened by the public 's fantastic support so far but we urgently need firm action from the government - not standard press assurances of ' working with authorities '			1
we need boots on the ground , search teams and dogs so that we can bring our son back alive			2
' as our prime minister i write to you but as a mother too , i hope you 'll help me			2
' she told @entity90 that the police response had been ' incredibly slow '			0
she said : ' the locals were , apparently , brilliant			0
they were out , very quickly , looking , searching as best they could , through terrain which they obviously know very well , but from what we understand the police response was incredibly slow			0
' she said it was out of character for him to go missing			0
' he 's got an exploring nature , he 's intelligent , and hopefully his ability to apply himself will get him through this			0
' he was on a break from work , he was due to start a new job in @entity110 next week			0
it 's totally out of character for him to go missing , he just would not do it			2
he knows there are too many people who care and love him			0

a picture of @entity25 - where the @entity4 was last seen			0
the charity worker was in @entity6 as he was taking a break from work they checked various different routes to the waterfall 6km away that he might have taken , while a further search the next day also proved fruitless			1
' it 's a huge wilderness out there - a remote location			0
he could have taken a wrong turn and just got lost in another valley ' - @entity16 mr @entity162 added : ' then the afternoon of the second day the police were informed - they sent a couple of members of the police force along to have a look but did n't go far or look very much - they were just sort of assessing the situation			0
' then the next day , the 29th , a group of volunteers went out and looked then came back again			0
another group from the local community also went out as well and went deep into the jungle			2
the police were no longer physically looking at that point - i think they were arranging for a search party but nothing happened that day			0
' then today we 've just been hoping the state police will do a proper search but nothing has happened yet			2
i do n't know what 's going on			0
@entity3 ( left ) who has not been seen since he went on a trek to visit a waterfall in @entity25 , off the south eastern coast of the @entity6 mainland @entity117 who has said ' time is running short ' to find her boyfriend @entity3 ( left ) who has not been seen since he went on a trek ' it 's a huge wilderness out there - a remote location			1
he could have taken a wrong turn and just got lost in another valley - we just do n't know			0
the trouble is the police probably do n't have proper search equipment - they need extra support			0
' a @entity214 group has been set up to raise awareness about mr @entity3 's disappearance			1
