by @entity1 reporter mention of sin is to be restored to the @entity5 ’s baptism service after an experiment dropping the use of the word was abandoned			2
the @entity5 announced in january that it was trying out new wording that asked parents and godparents to make a single , broad pledge to ‘ reject evil ’			1
among other phrases abandoned in the experimental christening rite were those referring to ‘ the deceit and corruption of evil ’ , ‘ the sins that separate us from @entity27 and neighbour ’ , and a promise to ‘ fight valiantly as a disciple of @entity21 against sin , the world and the devil ’			0
change : the word ' sin ' is set to be reinstated during a baptism service after an experiment to abandon it failed proposals set to be agreed by the @entity5 ’s @entity35 , meeting in @entity36 next month , restore use of the word sin – although they will still go ahead with axing the other phrases			1
in the new version , parents and godparents would only be required to say that they ‘ turn away from sin ’ and ‘ reject evil ’			1
changes are being made to adapt to a population that increasingly has no @entity47 background , the church said			0
officials had wanted to avoid putting off people who may be offended by being addressed as sinners			0
the traditional baptism rite – in use from 1662 to the 1960s – asks parents and godparents : ‘ @entity55 , in the name of this child , renounce the @entity58 and all his works , the vain pomp and glory of the world , with all covetous desires of the same , and the carnal desires of the flesh , so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by them ? ’ the @entity35 will also look at approving a ‘ shorter , clearer liturgy ’ for all services .			0

word is to be restored after attempt to get godparents to ' reject evil '
changes are set to be made during meeting of @entity35 next month
