@entity1 head coach @entity0 claims @entity2 are facing a dilemma over their tactics after discovering they are unable to match the @entity1 at a fast - paced game			1
@entity7 's tourists enter the series finale at @entity9 hoping to salvage some pride after slumping to defeat in the first two tests			2
they were blown away in the third quarter of the 28 - 27 loss in @entity14 , conceding three tries in 11 devastating minutes as @entity1 delivered a lesson in the art of finishing			1
blown away : @entity18 ( centre ) celebrates scoring the first of three @entity1 tries in 11 minutes @entity2 entered the series hoping to develop the high - tempo gameplan that served them well during the @entity24 , but @entity0 insists they are now overcome with doubt			1
' they are in a bit of a quandary really because they took us on in @entity14 playing a game of real pace and worked out they could n't , ' he said			0
' so what are they going to do now ? i 've seen @entity35 mention in the paper that maybe they should n't play too much rugby down their end , so maybe they 're going to kick a wee bit more			0
' but they will have a good plan because they are good coaches , so we 've just got to make sure we 've got a good one to counter it			0
' @entity2 are a determined bunch so they 'll want to put in another performance they can be proud of , so i do n't think we 've broken their spirit			2
re-jig : head coach @entity7 has made seven changes to the side that started in @entity14 stoking the fire : @entity1 head coach @entity0 has questioned @entity2 's selection ' they 're a group of people who believe in themselves , so they 'll get up again for the last test			1
' @entity2 arrived in @entity1 outlining their intent to win the series but have been outplayed by the world champions over the first two tests			1
in the 20 - 15 victory at @entity64 the @entity1 produced the match - winning try two minutes from time and in @entity14 they emerged convincing winners , even if the scoreline suggests otherwise			2
a 2 - 1 series defeat would be viewed as an acceptable return and head coach @entity7 admits their summer tour should be deemed a success or failure based on saturday 's outcome			1
' the series will be judged ultimately by the scoreline			0
we desperately want that win and that 's why we need to put in a high - quality performance , ' @entity7 said			1
try time : @entity84 was one of three englishmen to touch down in the second test ' we will judge the tour by results but also the knowledge and experience we 've learned about our players			0
' the ability to learn who can and who ca n't deliver at the highest level has been absolutely invaluable			0
' you can watch as many dvds and games as you like , but it 's only when you get your hands on players week in week out that you really learn the true strengths of individuals			0
' that 's been the most invaluable part of the tour because that 's what you need leading up to a @entity109			0
