by @entity0 published : 10:35 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 14:09 est , 29 may 2012 cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis , a large - scale study has concluded			1
the study at the @entity6 at @entity7 is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long - term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease			1
despite promising signs in earlier , shorter studies , researchers found patients who took capsules containing tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity20 ) , a key active ingredient in cannabis , fared no better than those given a placebo			1
damning research : cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis , a large - scale study has concluded the trial involved 493 people with progressive @entity31 at 27 centres around the @entity33 and began in 2006			1
participants took either @entity20 capsules or placebo for three years			1
in the study known as cupid - cannabinoid use in progressive inflammatory brain disease - @entity31 patients were assessed on both a disability scale administered by neurologists and another based on their own reporting			1
lead researcher @entity44 said : ' overall the study found no evidence to support an effect of @entity20 on @entity31 progression in either of the main outcomes			1
' the results from the study , which was funded by the @entity52 , were presented at the association of @entity55 ' annual meeting in @entity56 today			2
the research is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long - term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease cannabis contains more than 60 different cannabinoids , of which @entity20 is thought to be the most active , and many @entity31 patients have long said the drug helps them cope with the effects of the disease			1
drug companies , too , have been interested in cannabis as a medicine			2
soon after he turned 40 , @entity73 , from @entity74 , was diagnosed with @entity31 some five years later , separated from his wife , wheelchair - bound and re-housed in a bungalow , he was put on cannabis - based drug @entity79			1
‘ so far i ’ve taken it for six months			0
it looks like a breath freshener			0
i spray one burst under my tongue up to 15 times a day , from half an hour before i get up to just before i go to bed			0
it is alcohol - based , tastes unpleasantly bitter and is absorbed through the mouth ’s lining within 30 minutes			2
‘ it gives me relief from pain so i can relax or focus enough to make decisions			0
though i ’m in a wheelchair , it ’s nothing like the limitations caused by continual intense pain			0
in fact , it ’s been so effective that i ’ve stopped using painkillers			0
‘ cannabis has given me back my quality of life			2
it has aided my sleep , which means i am less irritable and depressed			0
it has improved my eyesight and allows me to control my bladder and bowel more easily			0
‘ i ’ve been able to sit at a computer and use voice - activated software			0
because it relaxes the body , it reduces the spasticity so i can even use an exercise bike			0
‘ because of @entity79 , i ’m able to walk @entity114 the dog in my wheelchair twice a day			0
’ @entity117 , working with @entity118 and @entity119 , recently started selling an under - the - tongue cannabis spray called @entity79 to relieve spasticity			2
. @entity122 , professor of neuropsychopharmacology at @entity123 , who was not involved in the latest research , said the study 's failure did not mean cannabis had no role in helping @entity31 patients			1
he said : ' it would be wrong to interpret these preliminary findings to mean that cannabis does not achieve its licensed use			0
' cannabis is not licensed for limiting disease progression , it is licensed for dealing with spasticity and pain			0
' professor @entity44 's study did find some evidence to suggest a beneficial effect in less disabled patients , but because this was seen in only a small group of people it was unclear how strong the effect was			1
the overall study population also experienced slower disease progression than had been expected , making it more challenging to detect any treatment effect , the researchers added			2
@entity31 is a disease in which immune system cells destroy the myelin sheath that protects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord			2
the most common type is relapsing remitting @entity31 , affecting around 85 per cent of patients at the time of diagnosis			1
several drugs are available to treat this stage of the disease , including injections of beta - interferons and a new pill from @entity168 called @entity169			0
secondary progressive @entity31 comes later and involves a sustained build up of disability .			1

researchers found patients who took capsules containing @entity20 , a key active ingredient in cannabis , fared no better than those given a placebo
study assessed @entity31 patients on both a disability scale administered by neurologists and another based on their own reporting
