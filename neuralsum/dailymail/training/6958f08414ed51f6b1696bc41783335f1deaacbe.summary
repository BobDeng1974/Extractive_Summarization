by @entity0 as the race to get to @entity3 heats up , new research suggests that dormant life could be hiding in the red planet ’s frozen water			1
if found , these microbes could someday be brought back to life , according to a team of scientists from @entity11 and the @entity12			0
the theory is based on evidence that @entity3 was hit by a huge flood millions of years ago when a large ice - covered lake cracked open			1
they believe microbes in this region could have been ' frozen ' after they were brought to the surface millions of years ago by a flood in the region evidence of water on @entity3 dates back to the @entity35 mission , which arrived on @entity3 in 1971			1
@entity35 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity44 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in theories about water on @entity3 by revealing how floods broke through dams , carved deep valleys , eroded grooves into bedrock , and traveled thousands of kilometres			1
@entity3 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			1
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june last year , curiosity rover found ' powerful evidence ' that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity3			2
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity65 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			2
today , @entity3 ' polar caps are known to be mostly water ice			1
frozen water has also been detected just under the surface at mid-latitudes			2
but the planet was once a far more watery world			0
several huge channels , dating from a time when @entity3 was just starting to evolve into the cold desert it is today , can be found on the planet ’s deep chasms and impact craters			2
@entity19 at the @entity11 in @entity20 and @entity21 at @entity22 recently made a detailed study of a @entity3 crater called @entity25			1
this crater has a channel 6.2 miles ( 10 km ) and 1.2 miles ( 2 km ) deep , which would have required almost 320,0000 ft3 ( 90,000 km3 ) of water to have flowed through it in a month			2
the researchers believe that a lake filled the crater when @entity3 was warmer			1
as the planet cooled , the lake froze solid and was covered in a layer of rock , according to a by @entity97 in @entity98			1
however , the scientists argue that at the same time , geothermal energy warmed the ice from below , creating a liquid layer			1
over thousands of years , the weakened sediment collapsed , breaking the ice and letting water gush to the planet ’s surface			1
today , @entity3 ' polar caps ( northern cap pictured ) are known to be mostly frozen water ice			1
frozen water has also been detected just under the surface at mid-latitudes where meteorite impacts have uncovered it this , according to the researchers , means that any microbial life in the liquid lake may have become dormant as the water refroze on an icy @entity3			1
‘ maybe these outflow channels are places where these dormant organisms came into a living state and would then have gone dormant again , ’ professor @entity19 told @entity98			0
‘ microbes could be waiting for us to drill a hole and sample ice and bring them back to life			2
’ on @entity133 , at least two types of bacteria have been found to happily live beneath a glacier in @entity3 - like temperatures			0
in a 2012 study , the bacteria — @entity138 and @entity139 — showed signs of respiration in ice designed to simulate as closely as possible the temperatures and nutrient content found at the bottom of @entity147 and @entity148 glaciers			0
researchers at @entity150 found that organisms could survive at temperatures ranging from -33 ° @entity153			0
@entity155 bugs from @entity133 could soon hitch a ride into space , arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are @entity160			0
this is according to @entity163 researcher , dr @entity162 , who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise @entity3			0
dr @entity162 highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights			0
currently , spacecraft landing on @entity3 or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life			1
these acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel			0
‘ if you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels , a proxy for cleanliness , the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions , ’ dr @entity162 said			0
however , spores of @entity194 have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft , such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment			0
when researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated @entity3 environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds , it survived 30 minutes .			2

researchers believe that a lake once filled the @entity25 crater on @entity3
as the planet cooled , the lake froze solid and was covered in a layer of rock
over thousands of years , geothermal energy weakened the sediment which collapsed , breaking the ice and letting water gush to the surface
this , according to the researchers , means that any microbial life in the liquid lake may have become dormant as the water refroze on an icy @entity3
