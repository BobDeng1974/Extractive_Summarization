participants in a new study of the use of police deadly force were more willing pull the trigger on armed white suspects than on blacks , researchers have found			1
the surprising results challenge previous findings about racial bias - and , one the researchers says , helps combat the stereotype that cops are more eager to open fire on black suspects			1
the authors of the study say the reaction delay is because officers fear that there will be greater repercussions from shooting a black suspect than a white one			1
the study , conducted at @entity27 - @entity26 's @entity25 , used a realistic simulator that showed video images of black , white and @entity30 suspects - both armed and unarmed			1
participants were given a real @entity33 pistol equipped with a laser and told to shoot armed attackers			0
the study tested more than 30 cops , as well as 60 civilians and a half - dozen members of the military			0
about 85percent of the study participants were white			0
realistic : a study that put participants in a simulator and had them shoot at armed suspects found that they were more hesitant to pull the trigger on blacks than on whites the study armed participants with a real glock pistol that fired lasers instead of bullets - and measured the reaction times and accuracy when confronted with an armed white suspect , participants took an average of 1.37 seconds to pull the trigger			1
but , they took 1.61 seconds to open fire on armed black suspects - and were less likely to shoot unarmed targets			1
that split - second pause could be deadly in a real life situation , researchers say			0
moreover , the study also monitored physiological responses to the shooting scenarios and found that shooters paused - despite participants perceiving the black suspects as being a bigger threat than the white suspects			1
the study contradicts previous findings that people were more likely to pull the trigger on black suspects @entity81 , a @entity27 - @entity26 professor , was lead author on the study the results were consistent for police officers , as well as civilians and members of the military , @entity81 , assistant research professor at @entity27 - @entity26 , told @entity88			1
' what it suggests that when faced with black suspects , there is something going on that is making some kind of pause or hesitation			2
what we think it might be is the fear of consequence , ' dr @entity97 said			0
dr @entity97 said those consequences could be moral - or they could be fear of backlash , either public brouhaha , criminal charges or departmental discipline			0
' there 's a history systemic racism in the @entity112 and there are still irrefutable facts about the treatment of some groups of people in the criminal justice system that i 'm sure weigh very heavily on a lot of officers , ' she said			0
dr @entity97 conceded that it is possible that the participants in the study knew that they were being watched by researchers and delayed opening fire on black suspects as a result			2
however , she says researchers worked to minimize that bias			0
the study was initially designed to test how fatigue , experience and other factors impact in decision - making in deadly force scenarios and so race was never mentioned with participants before they went through the course			0
additionally - dr @entity97 says - the simulator offers realistic scenarios that show life - size videos of police traffic stops and other incidents			2
the set - up means that most participants have very real physiological and psychological reactions to what 's unfolding in front of them , she says			0
previous studies that showed a people had a bias toward using force against black suspects used much less immersive techniques - having participants sit in front of a computer screen and push a ' shoot ' or ' do n't shoot ' button in response to pictures of armed suspects			1
the findings , co-authored by @entity165 , a criminal justice professor at the @entity167 , and @entity27 - @entity26 professor @entity168 , were published in may in the @entity169 .			2

when confronted with an armed white suspect , participants took an average of 1.37 seconds to pull the trigger
but , they took 1.61 seconds to open fire on armed black suspects - and were less likely to shoot unarmed targets
researchers believe reaction delay is because shooters fear consequences from *killing* a black suspect more than shooting a white
study from @entity27 - @entity26 used new , realistic simulations that were shown on a life - size video screen
