he said : ' over six years i had to give up all of the sports i loved			2
although taking my ankle away was a big sacrifice , the change to regain the ability to play those sports again meant it it was a no - brainer			1
alternative surgery : mr @entity4 , posing above with his girlfriend @entity54 , 30 , took his forthcoming operation in extremely good humour ' please cut here ' : shortly before his operation , mr @entity4 asked for the tongue - in - cheek tattoo , which he sent to his surgeon jokes : mr @entity4 's leg can be seen above at the tattoo parlour having the amusing design drawn on ' it took me a little while to get past the emotional hurdles			1

extreme : mr @entity4 , pictured here performing a headstand whilst snowboarding , drew up a bucket list of extreme sports to get done before losing the ankle taking the plunge : mr @entity4 , who has always been a sports enthusiast , could have tried other surgery , but decided to push on with amputation as it would provide a definite solution big leap : mr @entity4 and miss @entity54 are shown above in a plane from which they are about to skydive an operation to remove the tumours was carried out but within six months they had grown back			1

to be told that i would n't be able to play sports was the worst thing i had ever heard			0
' in march 2014 he had an mri which revealed that the nodules had once again returned			0
doctors advised that the only option was to fuse his ankle and have surgeries for the rest of his life			2
despite their advice to undergo the fusion treatment , mr @entity4 decided to go for amputation instead as it would allow him to continue playing sport			1
out and about : mr @entity4 , pictured riding a wheelchair in hospital , says he is looking forward to incorporating his new leg into @entity146 costumes heartwarming : mr @entity4 documented the three months of his life before the amputation , and included the first stages of his recovery from the procedure mr @entity4 said : ' it came down to either going through surgeries for a good portion of my life or have one surgery to end them all and be as active as i want on a prosthetic			1

' mr @entity4 and his girlfriend @entity169 , 30 , decided to create a photo record , beginning three months before he had surgery			1
he said : ' we drew up a list of things which we wanted to do while i could			0
it was heartbreaking to lose it , but that was n't going to stop me doing things before i lost it			0
' before and after : mr @entity4 poses left at a swimming pool before the operation , and right walking through hospital with crutches , wearing a bizarre beard disguise activities included go - karting , paintballing , watersliding and skydiving			1
the couple went on vacation to the @entity192 and went scuba diving and parasailing			0
in an expression of mr @entity4 's bravery and sense of humour , he uploaded pictures with electric saws and paintball guns , offering them up as alternative ways to remove his leg			1

he said : ' i sent a picture of my tattoo in an email to the surgeon while he was at a conference in @entity217			0
he showed the photos around and it became a big hit			0
' right before the surgery , i freaked out a bit			0
i realised there would be no way to turn back from my decision once i 'd had the surgery			0
' but as soon as i woke up from the surgery and looked down , i knew i had done the right thing ' i start getting fitted for a new leg as soon as the sutures are out			2
' he is already planning @entity146 costume ideas with his girlfriend			0
he said : ' i could be a surfer and she could be a shark - maybe we could add a surfboard with a shark bite out of it			0
' i would like to get a leg with a usb port that converts the kinetic energy from me walking into electrical energy to charge my phone			0
' miss @entity169 said : ' he is an inspiration to me			0
him losing part of his leg would n't change my feelings for him at all			0
' i let him make the decision which was right for him and i support him entirely			0
