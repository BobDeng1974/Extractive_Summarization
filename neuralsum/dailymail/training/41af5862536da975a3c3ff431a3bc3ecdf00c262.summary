an 84 - year old man was just trying to cook shrimp for his 70 - year - old girlfriend when he accidentally burned down her house leaving four of her pets dead			1
a year later , having put the incident behind them , he received a letter telling him that his girlfriend was suing him			2
@entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 , was informed that @entity13 had filed a lawsuit against him for $ 152,926 plus interest for damage to her home in the 2012 cooking fire			1
@entity10 accidentally burned down his girlfriend 's house while cooking shrimp for a dinner party			1
the couple and her dog made it out alive , but unfortunately her two cats and two birds did not a year after the fire , @entity13 ( left ) was as shocked as @entity10 ( right ) when a letter arrived stating that she was suing him for damages			1
the couple now live together with @entity32 caring for @entity10 who has health issues ' i guess i was just stunned			2
i said , ' my @entity37 , what 's going on ? '' @entity10 told @entity38 5			0
but @entity32 had n't filed the suit and was just as shocked as @entity10 , who has since moved in with her			1
far from opponents locked in a hostile legal battle , @entity32 now cares for him as he has health problems			0
' i do n't know what i 'd do without her , ' he said			0
the 2012 fire erupted during an august 18 , 2012 , dinner party at @entity32 's house when @entity10 poured water into an outdoor fish cooker , lit the fire underneath it and went to get the shrimp			1
within minutes he realized both the cooker and the house were on fire			0
efforts to put out the blaze failed and the @entity32 's home was destroyed			1
both she and @entity10 escaped unharmed , as did her dog , but her two cats and two birds died in the blaze			0
@entity32 filed an insurance claim with @entity66 , and the company paid to put her into a temporary rental property and to repair the damage			1
damage to the house was total , but @entity32 's insurance company , @entity66 , had put her in temporary accommodation and paid to repair the damage			1
after several months she was able to move back in after several months she was able to move back into her home			0
but a year later the letter arrived in the mail specifically naming her as the plaintiff and @entity10 as the defendant in the legal action			0
neither of them could believe it , and @entity32 wondered who was signing her name			0
it turned out that suit had been filed by @entity66 in @entity32 's name in a legal process known as ' subrogation ' , where insurers seek reimbursement when they believe someone else is at fault and should pay for damages			1
in this case , @entity66 accused @entity10 of leaving the fryer unattended			2
@entity10 had his own insurance at the time through @entity101 , which is providing his attorney free of charge to fight the case			2
the policy he had at the time covers him up to $ 300,000 â€“ more than enough to cover the claim			0
while filed in their names , the lawsuit is actually between the two insurance companies and not @entity32 and @entity10			2
neither company wants to actually foot the bill for the damage			0
on paper the lawsuit names @entity32 and @entity10 as the plaintiff and defendant , but in reality it is their respective insurance companies fighting over which should pay the damages ' when is it going to end ? what 's it going to cost me ? will i live long enough to see it ? ' said @entity10 ( right ) while in the end @entity10 probably wo n't have to pay for the damages , and @entity32 technically wo n't receive a penny , both of them feel anxious to be caught in the middle			1
' it 's a mess , ' @entity32 said			0
they worry constantly about the lawsuit , which has been delayed five times since it was filed in may 2013 in @entity138			0
' when is it going to end ? what 's it going to cost me ? will i live long enough to see it ? ' said @entity10			2
@entity66 declined to comment on the case , but @entity101 released a statement : ' we are working diligently to secure all the relevant information necessary to properly defend our customer and hope to resolve this matter soon			2
' worse than the stress of the lawsuit , @entity32 's homeowner 's insurance rocketed to $ 1,000 per month from $ 1,200 per year			1
not being able to afford the higher rate she is forced to go without coverage .			0
