by @entity0 the whistles of derision that greet @entity4 's every touch at @entity5 are being noted at @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity5 coach @entity8 and club directors have launched a staunch defence of the 26 - year - old who has been targeted by fans throughout the season and more so in recent weeks following their team 's @entity15 exit followed and defeat to @entity18 in the @entity19			1
teammate @entity20 said : ' of course it hurts to see @entity4 jeered			0
you try to ignore it and hope it does not happen , but these situations are not comfortable			0
' video scroll to the bottom for @entity28 and @entity4 on the proposed move in summer 2013 on his way ? @entity4 could find his time at the @entity33 up soon , with some fans booing him on sunday staunch defence : coach @entity8 has refused to criticise his midfielder this season there would be no sense for @entity5 to sell @entity40 unless they have their transfer ban lifted but they will hold talks with him and his representatives to ascertain his state of mind and where they see changes over the coming weeks			1
@entity5 's board will offer @entity49 an improved contract but have held meetings already to discuss who could leave with some key changes expected			1
@entity54 and @entity55 are also among players who could depart as is @entity58 @entity57 said : ' some decisions have been made and there are others to be made			0
this is not the time to announce them because we are still playing in competition			0
there will be time for that in a few weeks			2
' a lot of work has been done and it has all been good work			0
there wo n't be a revolution , but there will be in - depth restructuring of the football team			0
' are we going to see this again ? the @entity78 are on red alert if @entity4 is free to leave the @entity33 @entity81 ' son attracting @entity83 attention @entity84 and @entity85 are among the clubs showing interest in @entity89 's latest starlet @entity88			1
the 18 - year - old striker is the son of former @entity91 and @entity92 international @entity81 and is showing his father 's old traits in front of goal			0
@entity88 has scored more than 30 goals this season playing for @entity89 's development sides and in the @entity100 , where he notably scored twice against @entity101 and @entity102			0
although coaches insist he still needs to get stronger , he is quick , bright and has an obvious instinct to push himself into the right areas			0
@entity89 have high hopes and have offered @entity88 a three year professional contract and signing it will be a crucial decision if other clubs are serious in showing the same commitment to his development			2
his father @entity114 is keen to play down @entity88 's prospects , when pressed on tv recently he would only say : ' he has a chance if he keeps working hard			0
' @entity117 could yet opt to stay and follow the route of other @entity89 youngsters safe in the knowledge scouts will always be present to see the latest starlet to roll off the @entity123 conveyor belt			0
@entity125 winger @entity124 too expensive interest gathering in @entity125 winger @entity124 could be tempered by a pending increase in his buy - out clause			1
despite the 21 - year - old having only one year left on contract , his clause is set to move up to a whopping £ 40million on july 1 , similar to that of teammate @entity133			2
@entity134 , @entity6 , @entity91 and @entity7 are all firm admirers of the boy from @entity137 but wo n't deal at that price			1
the notoriously stubborn @entity125 board have rebuffed all talk of selling for reported bids of a cut - price £ 14million so the real work will be done by his representatives			1
clubs are hoping to persuade him not to sign any new contract at @entity125 and instead move as a free agent next summer			1
the warning signs for the youngster though are that @entity152 took a similar path but endured a troublesome time before his eventual departure to @entity156			2
too expensive ? @entity124 could have his buy - out clause at @entity125 upped at the end of the season waiting game : @entity161 will not rush into offering a new deal to striker @entity163 @entity163 wo n't be offered new @entity161 contract soon @entity161 will not rush into offering a new deal to striker @entity163			1
the 27 - year - old has talked up his chances of getting improved terms despite having only signed a four year contract last summer			2
the @entity170 international is on 28 league goals going into today 's game against @entity174 and could become the first @entity161 player since @entity176 in 1957 to score 30 league goals in a season			1
talking after his latest goal earned the 1 - 0 win over @entity181 at the weekend , @entity163 said : ' in terms of my future , i 've got a couple of years left on my contract			1
it 's up to the new owner if he wants to put a contract in front of me to sign , be part of this new regime and hopefully take the club forward			0
' if that 's not the case , we 'll look at other things			0
' he added : ' it 's good to be talked of in the same breath as @entity176			0
hopefully i can nick another two between now and the end of the season			0
personally , it 's been a great season			0
it 's just unfortunate that collectively we 've not been good enough and the table does not lie			0
' despite failed bids by @entity210 and @entity211 in january , @entity161 ' only other offer for @entity163 has come from @entity212 and that was last summer			1
@entity210 remain in the market for a striker , however , @entity163 may find surprise options in @entity217			1
new owner @entity218 who is in the throes of selling his other club @entity220 said : ' @entity163 is a real striker and i 'd love to see him in @entity217			2
' surprise in store ? @entity218 said he would like to see @entity163 ply his trade over in @entity217 @entity224 a wanted @entity225 @entity210 's @entity224 is figuring on a few shortlists ahead of the summer			2
the 32 - year - old has been left out of the starting line - up in recent weeks and is a free agent at the end of the season when his contract runs out			1
his @entity83 experience and versatility are making him an option for sides looking to bolster their squad with @entity239 players			2
@entity224 has figured at left - back , left midfield and centre midfield			0
on the move ? @entity224 is wanted by a selection of clubs when the season finishes next month @entity247 wanted by @entity7 @entity7 are continuing to track @entity248 midfielder @entity247			1
the 17 - year - old winger has impressed in the @entity250 this season scoring four goals in nine games including one in the 2 - 1 win over @entity134 in march			0
@entity255 and @entity6 have also shown an interest but @entity248 are pushing for the player to sign a new contract so they can hike up his value			1
@entity7 are also continuing to watch @entity261 's @entity260 but the 16 - year - old is keen to stay and develop at the @entity264 club			2
keeping tabs : @entity7 are having a look at young @entity248 midfielder @entity247			1

@entity7 and @entity6 are alerted to the treatment @entity270 has received at @entity5 in recent weeks
@entity125 winger @entity124 could prove too expensive for @entity83 *suitors*
@entity161 are in no rush to offer @entity163 a new contract
@entity7 are tracking @entity248 youngster @entity247
