many of us dream about escaping our everyday lives for something more exotic			2
ten years ago , bartender @entity4 did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world			1
the 34 - year - old left her home in @entity9 , @entity10 , when she was given a @entity12 sailboat on the condition that she sail the globe and document her travels			1
' after i graduated from university , i happened to cross paths with a retired professor , dr. @entity29 , who was looking for someone to sail his boat around the world , ' says @entity4			1
' he was 80 years old at the time and just wanted to help someone else realize his dream			1
' @entity4 , who studied environmental studies at the @entity38 in @entity39 , jumped at the chance			1
she says : ' at university i learned about all the damage we were doing to the @entity44 and the unsustainable lifestyles we were leading			0
' i looked around me and it seemed like no one was doing anything about it , and i decided that i really did n't want to be a part of it anymore			0
' i knew this trip would be everything i loved in one - a simple , eco-friendly lifestyle close to nature , searching for remote uncrowded waves , learning from other cultures , challenging myself physically and mentally , and going on an open - ended adventure			0
' @entity4 , who studied environmental studies at the @entity38 in @entity39 , jumped at the chance to discover the world as well as perfect her sailing skills , the ten - year trip has helped @entity4 perfect her surf - boarding talents sailing around the world offers @entity4 the perfect chance for scenic stop - offs to practise yoga after graduating from university , @entity4 worked as a bartender for three years , before quitting her job when the opportunity to sail around the world arose			1
she spent three years preparing for her voyage and learning how to operate the sailboat			2
@entity4 says : ' it was petrifying to leave the safety and security of the dock and my friends and family			2
' i did n't know if i would be capable of captaining a boat this big and managing all that goes into a trip where you 're off the grid and away from any help - but i knew i had to try or i 'd always regret it			0
' when i left i did n't know how i 'd make money , and i do n't come from a wealthy family or anything , like many people assume			0
' i was writing blogs the first year and from this i developed a close relationship with @entity96 , an outdoors clothing company - who have been my main financial supporter since the beginning			0
' it 's often hard work for @entity4 , as she is photographed here fixing the anchor in the ground to secure her boat in the eastern @entity104 @entity4 did make a friend when she visited @entity106 in 2013 , and even took the cat on the boat with her her travels around the world have given @entity4 memories to treasure forvever , including enjoying herself with the locals in @entity114 in 2007 setting off in october 2005 , @entity4 has travelled to a number of exotic destinations , including @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity114 and the @entity121			1

she says : ' people are generally either awed or jealous , others are totally inspired and excited			0
' it feels so great to inspire others to live their dreams , but it 's impossible to explain to them what this life is really like ; how much hard work there is and that it is n't always easy or fun			0
' but that 's part of living your dreams - it 's never easy , but no work is ever as hard when it 's part of your dreams and moving you towards your desires			0
