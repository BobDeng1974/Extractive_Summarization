by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's a case of spot the difference between @entity5 's poster promoting the @entity6 and the other competing countries			1
the ' i root for ' slogan is emblazoned across the other 23 teams ' promotional material but @entity5 's poster was wisely changed to ' i support @entity5 ' for the @entity13 championship that runs for the next two weeks in @entity14			1
although ' rooting ' is a term widely used across the globe to imply you support or follow a particular team or country in sport , the word is more commonly used as a slang word among @entity5 for having sex			1
using the word ' support ' was the better option for @entity5 instead of ' root ' like the other 23 posters one of the 23 posters that have the slogan ' i root for ' @entity30 very commonly used the term ' root ' to talk about their support for a team the change was made after @entity36 suggested @entity37 alter the marketing material in question to suit the @entity5 market			1
' given the connotations of the original slogan â€“ we think basketball is exciting enough as it is without other activities on top , ' a @entity42 spokesperson said			1
the alteration of the poster started a debate on @entity52 with some thinking the @entity5 term should have been changed to ' barrack '			1
' if they understood @entity5 slang it would be ' i barack ( sic ) for @entity5 ' one said			2
another replied suggesting that ' barrack ' was only a @entity63 term while others chimed in saying the word was also used in @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
some @entity5 think the word ' barrack ' should have been used instead of ' support ' then the conversation went onto whether barrack was used across the country then someone suggested it was an old - fashioned term : ' i 've heard it rarely and it was mostly other people saying it '			2
' i think it 's @entity5 wide ...			2
but is slowly falling out of fashion an some areas are just hanging onto it longer , ' another posted			0
but others thought ' barrack ' was only used in the football code of @entity88 which was originally known as the @entity88 and only played in @entity63			0
' i have a suspicion it 's just an @entity88 thing			0
i 've never heard someone say they barrack for their team unless they 're talking about @entity93			0
' @entity94 do n't seem to have a problem with using the ' i root ' slogan some suggested that ' barrack ' was just possibly an @entity88 term others thought it was simply an old - fashioned word that was dying out			0

all 23 countries except @entity5 have the poster slogan ' i root for ' to promote the @entity106
@entity36 requested the material be changed to ' i support '
the sport is exciting enough ' without other activities on top ' it said
' @entity115 ' is more commonly used as slang among @entity5 for having sex
