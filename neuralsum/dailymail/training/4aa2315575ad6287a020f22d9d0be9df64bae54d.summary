a spectacular row broke out last night over @entity2 ’s alleged attempts to silence a leading @entity4 academic who questioned independence			0
the first minister tried to force @entity7 , @entity8 , to tone down warnings about the adverse impact of a @entity12 vote			2
a source said he spent ten minutes attempting to ‘ put words in her mouth ’			1
he reportedly emailed her press secretary with a suggested statement , reading : ‘ the @entity32 has risen to the challenge on fees in stark contrast to the government south of the border and i ’m sure they can rise to the challenge on research funding as well			1
’ but in a reply , professor @entity7 wrote : ‘ i ’m sorry but i ’m afraid i can not agree to this statement			2
’ it is also claimed the first minister called professor @entity7 , the first female principal of the 600 - year - old institution , and told her to rectify remarks she made about the consequences of @entity4 leaving the @entity45			1
flying solo : the row started in march last year as professor @entity7 warned independence could prove ‘ catastrophic ’ for @entity50 ’s if it threatened access to £ 3billion of @entity45 scientific grants handed out each year a source familiar with the conversation said that the first minister spent 10 minutes attempting to ‘ put words in her mouth ’ about the impact of independence			1
the row started in march last year as professor @entity7 warned independence could prove ‘ catastrophic ’ for @entity50 ’s if it threatened access to £ 3billion of scientific research handed out each year by the @entity45			2
prof @entity7 added @entity61 was concerned about the funding gap left by @entity64 students she challenged the @entity24 government ’s assumption that an independent @entity4 would be able to ‘ buy into ’ the funds administered by @entity68 , which give @entity4 universities a lucrative share of national funding			1
she told the @entity73 newspaper : ‘ if we were cut off from national research councils it would be catastrophic for this institution			0
' we would lose our top academics , we would fail to attract serious academics [ from other countries ]			0
’ prof @entity7 added that @entity61 was concerned about the funding gap that would be left by @entity64 students who would no longer be liable to pay their £ 9,000 tuition fees because they would be treated in the same way as other @entity85 students			1
in november last year , prof @entity7 urged her staff to reject ‘ external pressure ’ to take a certain stance on independence , and said she was concerned that academics ‘ may feel constrained about speaking publicly on the issue or fear adverse consequences if they do ’			2
in a letter to all members of staff , she wrote : ‘ i would very much hope , however , that university staff feel no constraints whatever in expressing their views , whatever they are , on the issue of independence			0
‘ indeed i would encourage you to do so			0
at times of national uncertainty the public justifiably look to universities for reasoned debate and considered argument and i think it incumbent upon us to provide just that			0
‘ whether or not my personal views are in accord with yours , any external pressure to limit or suppress debate will stop at my door			0
