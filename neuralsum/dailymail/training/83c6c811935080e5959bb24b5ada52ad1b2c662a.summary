by @entity1 reporter published : 12:03 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 14:32 est , 26 september 2012 banned : fitness instructor @entity2 was told she could not hold her yoga class at a @entity4 as it was a @entity5 religious activity she meant her yoga classes to be a calming and relaxing experience for all those concerned			1
instead , @entity2 has ended up flustered and frustrated after a priest banned her from his church hall because her lessons are ‘ not compatible ’ with the catholic faith			1
the 37 - year - old instructor was told by father @entity14 that yoga is a @entity5 religious activity and therefore not in keeping with his rules on promoting @entity4 activities			1
the ban is not @entity4 policy and decisions are left to the discretion of individual priests			1
miss @entity2 said staff at @entity25 in @entity26 accepted the booking two months ago and she paid £ 180			2
but with just ten days to go before the start of the classes she was called and told that yoga was from another religion so she could not have the hall			1
a separate pilates class she had booked was also cancelled			2
she said : ' i had never heard about any religious issue with yoga before but i have looked into it since and found that some other religions feel that when people meditate it could let the devil inside them			2
' but there was never any meditation in my class – it was just exercises			2
' as a nation we have an obesity epidemic			0
i was trying to bring some exercise to the community and coming across blocks like this is frustrating			0
' i tried to explain to the church that my yoga classes were not religious at all and i even offered to come and demonstrate the class			1
' it is about calmness and relaxation			0
' paid up : @entity2 spent £ 180 to book the hall , but with just ten days to go she was told she could not use it father @entity14 said the church was ' misled ' by @entity64 's booking because he claimed that , at first , the hall was booked for pilates and then he found out it was also for spiritual yoga			1
he said : ' yoga is a @entity5 spiritual exercise			1
being a @entity4 we have to promote the gospel and that 's what we use our premises for			0
' we did say that yoga could not take place			0
it ’s the fact that it 's a different religious practice going on in a @entity4			0
religious : father @entity14 , left , said the lesson , advertised by this flyer , right , was not in keeping with his rules on promoting @entity4 activities welcome : a spokesman for the diocese said in 17 years it was the first time he had commented on a yoga ban ' we are not saying that yoga is bad or wrong			2
' yoga enthusiasts criticised father @entity14 ’s stance as ' ignorant ' and even urged the priest to try a session			0
@entity94 , of the charity @entity96 wheel of yoga , said : ' research demonstrates yoga improves people 's health and wellbeing physically and mentally			0
who could object to that ? ' give it a go : yoga enthusiasts criticised the priest 's stance as ' ignorant ' and urged him to try it out a spokesman for the local @entity113 said in 17 years it was the first time he had been asked to comment on a yoga ban but it was up to individual priests			1
he said : ' we do n’t allow anything that can be construed as @entity121 worship			0
' there is a dilemma with yoga , which could be seen as a form of relaxation – or a @entity121 , possible @entity5 , meditation			1
