human keep - fit enthusiasts have long had any number of gadgets for measuring their exertions in the parks and pools			0
now there ’s a device that lets them get the same information about their canine friends			0
the gadget and accompanying mobile phone app mean dog - owners can monitor how much exercise their pet is taking , even when they are far away at work or on holiday			1
tracker : the watch - sized device is attached to a dog 's collar ( pictured ) and keeps track of their activity a small circular device , about the size of a watch face , attached to the dog ’s collar gathers the data			1
information from the @entity32 can then be downloaded on to a mobile phone or a computer to reveal whether the animal has spent the afternoon lazing in its basket or burning off energy in the garden			1
the data is then beamed to a smartphone and appears as a graph showing how much exercise your pet got and at what times exercise goals can be set each day and the dog ’s performance compared with other animals of a similar age and breed			1
every action – from a stroll around the house to a high - speed chase after the neighbour ’s cat – is recorded on the phone as a graph			0
this displays how much and how quickly the dog has moved around			0
the heart of the device is a three - axis accelerometer , whose readings are translated into the graph by specially designed algorithms			0
it also tracks the dog ’s exact location using wireless technology and comes with a usb charger for topping up the battery every five days or so			2
the @entity75 manufacturers say the device gives owners a new perspective on a dog ’s day - to - day behaviour and allows them to track long - term health trends			1
chief executive @entity81 , who has been a dog - owner all his life , said it was capable of detecting veterinary problems that might otherwise be missed			2
he said : ‘ dogs are very good at hiding the signs [ of deteriorating health ] from owners			2
if you can see a change in activity , it makes it possible to spot problems sooner and get them treated with less expensive and more preventative measures			0
’ appropriately for the current @entity97 climate , @entity32 is completely waterproofed – so the gadget wo n’t short out even if walkies are in the torrential rain			0
it is on sale online for around £ 80 .			1

the £ 80 @entity32 attaches to a dog 's collar
the @entity108 tracks to animal 's activity during the day
the data is then sent to a smartphone and *plotted* as a graph
it allows pet owners to compare their pet to others of the same age
makers say it can show health trends that might otherwise be missed
