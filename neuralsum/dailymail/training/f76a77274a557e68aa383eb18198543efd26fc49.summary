former top prosecutor sir @entity0 says time should be a barrier to justice @entity5 's former top prosecutor has controversially defended police who hold suspects in a ‘ legal limbo ’ for years while alleged crimes are investigated			1
@entity0 , the ex- director of public prosecutions , disagreed with those who have called for time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged			1
he said time ‘ should not be a barrier ’ to bringing people to justice for crimes committed decades earlier			1
a number of high - profile celebrities , including @entity21 and @entity22 , have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain about the attacks			1
but there have been mounting concerns about cases where suspects are left on bail for long periods – often with strict curbs to their freedom – without charges being pressed			1
veteran disc jockey @entity37 spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from @entity40 , the inquiry launched after @entity41 was unmasked as a prolific paedophile after his death , only to be told last month ( @entity44 ) he would not face sexual assault charges			2
the openly gay @entity46 , who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys , told of his ‘ 12 months of horror and trauma ’ having his name dragged through the mud			0
home secretary @entity53 has signalled she wants time limits on pre-charge bail amid mounting concern that police forces are misusing their powers by keeping people dangling for months and even years			1
in an article in this week ’s @entity62 , on sale today @entity60 , mr @entity0 said the passage of time should not provide immunity against bringing charges against historic offenders			2
he said : ‘ i do not underestimate the impact that delay has on those arrested and subsequently released without charge , such as @entity37			0
equally , there is the impact on those tried and acquitted			0
‘ but they are features of our system whatever the time limits for bringing a case			1
‘ i certainly would n’t want to replicate the situation in countries such as @entity83 where virtually all those arrested are charged and virtually all those charged are convicted			1
‘ that some individuals are released without charge and some are acquitted demonstrates the strength , not the weakness , of our approach			0
’ police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge			0
a number of high - profile celebrities , including @entity21 , left , and @entity22 , right , have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain in practice , they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date , giving officers time to build robust cases			1
but there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold , pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their character			1
conditions can also be placed on police bail , which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues			2
comedian @entity129 lashed out at the system after being arrested under the @entity40 and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges			0
@entity133 , another comedian , spent 19 months on bail after being arrest by officers investigating decades - old sex allegations made by 14 women			2
veteran dj @entity37 spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from @entity40 , but was told last month he would not face sexual assault charges some 30 journalists are currently on bail – some for more than a year – while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories			1
the @entity150 , the professional body that sets police standards , have been asked by ministers to consider introducing time limits for pre-charge bail , which human rights groups believe should be 28 days			1
mr @entity0 said it was right to prosecute people for historic crimes – whether it was a ‘ an @entity161 guard standing trial in @entity163 … or a host of greying celebrities on suspicion of historic sex crimes			2
’ he said there had been a ‘ profound shift ’ from the long - held view that not bringing a prosecution within a certain period of time was ‘ not fair on defendents ’			2
there had been a ‘ growing understanding that time runs at different speed for victims , ’ particularly those who had suffered sexual violence , he said			0
‘ in a sense they carry an unresolved issue with them , almost an open wound , for many years , maybe even for their entire lives			0
‘ we are rightly reluctant to say that those now coming forward to report serious allegations , not infrequently against those in the public eye , that they are simply too late			0
’ acknowledging that the passage of time caused ‘ difficiulties ’ for both the prosecution and defence , because of fading memories and lost evidence , he said it was ‘ simply not a good enough reason not to bring a case ’			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ most importantly , we now understand victims ’ interests better and recognise that , for many , achieving closure , the knowledge that someone has been held to account , is an end in itself			0
‘ we have to be bolder , and clearer , in saying that pure delay should not be a barrier to bringing people to justice			2
the public does not accept any longer that the passage of time immunises anyone			0
‘ my own view is that for the most serious offences , and in that i include serious sexual offences , time should never run out			0
