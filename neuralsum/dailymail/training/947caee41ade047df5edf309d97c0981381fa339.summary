tucked away at @entity1 's @entity0 is a little transfer gem			1
well , maybe not little ; 5ft 11ins and 13st of pure muscle , actually			0
it 's @entity5 - the man once heralded as the undisputed successor to @entity9 's @entity8 right - back			1
where did it all go wrong ? @entity5 ( centre ) appears to have no future at @entity1 next big thing : @entity5 broke on to the scene with a last - minute equaliser for @entity1 at @entity17 in 2006 from being one of @entity24 's hottest teenage properties , @entity19 ' chances of first - team football under @entity21 are virtually non-existent			1
as if his chances of senior football were not remote enough thanks to outstanding form of @entity29 , the summer arrival of @entity31 has pushed @entity19 further down the pecking order			1
but with six days left to go of the transfer window , the versatile defender is still to escape his @entity1 hell			1
first and foremost , it 's important to stress that @entity19 is n't happy simply taking his money and remaining in the @entity40 shadows			1
he wants a move ; a chance to kick - start his once burgeoning career			0
likewise , city manager @entity21 has publicly stated his decision to let the 26 - year - old leave for pastures new			2
so where is the problem , you might ask ? you might start dissecting the issue when considering @entity19 ' asking price			0
despite having less than 12 months on his contract , @entity1 value the defender at around £ 7million			1
@entity56 : @entity19 ( centre ) appeared to have the world at his feet and it seemed he would be in first team for years surplus : @entity19 does not look like he will get any game time at the @entity40 this season they have tried to extend his contract , twice , but @entity19 has turned down both offers - which would have secured him a pay rise - knowing he could fade further into the football wilderness remaining at @entity1			1
there 's not been a shortage of interest in the right - back , either			2
@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 have all given serious consideration to signing @entity19			1
but £ 7m for a player who will be available for nothing next summer makes little financial sense			2
@entity19 ' camp hope that issue will be resolved this week			0
@entity90 understands the player 's representatives will meet with @entity1 officials in the next few days in a bid to resolve the issues that have prevented his exit this summer			2
as well as @entity99 interest there is strong interest from @entity101 and @entity102 , and @entity19 is open to a move abroad to kick - start his stalling career			2
the next six days will be crucial in determining how @entity19 stops the downward trend			0
a move this summer will help reinvigorate a career that once promised so much ; another 12 months on the sidelines at @entity1 would merely add to his reputation as @entity114 football 's forgotten man			1
arrival : the signing of @entity31 has made @entity19 third - choice right - back at the @entity40 looking ahead : @entity19 ( right ) signed a long - term contract in 2008 and was expected to stay be @entity1 's future but the transfer stand - off does little to explain why @entity19 has fallen off the radar so rapidly over the last two years			1
@entity19 played a key role in @entity1 's first ever @entity99 title triumph in 2012 - making 37 appearances for the club			1
his performances that season saw him nominated for the club 's player of the season award			0
@entity131 was taking notice , too			0
@entity19 just missed out on @entity8 's @entity134 squad , but was offered a place in the stand - by group			1
his much - publicised decision to turn down the opportunity was met with huge criticism			0
@entity19 had his reasons , though			0
as he explained at the time : ' i have always said i wanted to play for @entity8			0
' whether i get picked for the next game , it 's not down to me			0
all i can do is keep knocking on the door			0
' i will never turn my back on @entity8			2
a lot of people asked me why i did n't go on standby			0
it was nothing to do with not wanting to play for @entity8			0
' i wanted to play ( get on pitch , not just be on standby )			0
@entity152 ( @entity153 ) has given me the chance to play ( at @entity155 )			0
' international : @entity5 played for @entity8 against @entity156 in 2012 and appeared to be back on track @entity158 : @entity19 burst on to the international scene and he was expected to turn into a world - class defender in hindsight , the decision probably was n't the smartest			1
not necessarily because of the stigma that has followed his ever since , but because of the injuries that have followed			0
he picked up an ankle injury that ruled him out for 10 weeks playing for @entity170 at the @entity171 ; subsequently he went on to make just seven @entity99 appearances for @entity1 that season			0
a knee injury sustained against @entity175 in october 2012 ruled @entity19 out for six months , allowing @entity29 to establish himself as @entity1 's premier right - back			1
the @entity179 's outstanding form has played a key role in @entity19 ' lack of game time in recent seasons			2
but so too has his unwillingness to sign a new contract			0
preferred : @entity187 has signed a new deal at the @entity40 and will feature ahead of @entity5 power : @entity19 was renowned for his strength and speed and looked set to dominate the @entity99 and there is a feeling within the @entity19 camp that the deal snub has played a key role in @entity21 's decision to push the defender to the @entity1 peripheries			1
@entity29 's performances are generally considered the main reasons for his lack of action , but while @entity21 rotated in every position last season - the right - back slot remained consistent			1
left - back @entity210 made 32 appearances for @entity1 last season , his rival in that position @entity209 made 44			1
in contrast , @entity29 made 48 appearances last season , @entity19 just 10			2
@entity21 has pointed to @entity19 ' injury problems last season , but those close to the versatile defender insist he was unavailable for just 10 games last season			2
the next few days is likely to shape whether @entity19 can re-affirm his position as one of @entity8 's premier defenders			2
what is for sure , though , is that his next club will be getting a player desperate to make up fir two years in the wilderness			0
@entity227 - bound ? @entity82 boss @entity228 is believed to be interested in bringing @entity19 to @entity229			1

@entity19 once heralded as @entity9 's replacement as @entity8 right - back
he has become virtually non-existent under @entity1 boss @entity21
@entity31 and @entity29 are both ahead of him in pecking order
@entity19 expected to leave the @entity40 before transfer window closes
despite having less than 12 months on contract , @entity1 want a £ 7m fee
@entity19 has turned down two contract extensions from the club
@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 all considered him
at 26 years old , @entity19 is open to moving abroad to further his creer
