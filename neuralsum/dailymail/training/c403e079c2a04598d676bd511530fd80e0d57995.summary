this is the moment a @entity2 film crew were held by security teams at the notoriously secretive @entity4 - where conspiracy theorists believe the @entity7 government is hiding a flying saucer			1
@entity10 comedian @entity9 and @entity12 expert @entity11 sneaked past the border at the site - and were forced to lie on the ground at gunpoint for three hours while the @entity17 checked their credentials			1
it is the same ' documentary ' team that caused outrage in @entity22 last week when they suggested that the 7/7 @entity25 bombings were part of a government conspiracy to boost support for the @entity30 war			1
do not enter : the moment the team sneak into @entity4 - and security teams immediately step in to arrest them a member of @entity4 's security team can be seen ( second from left ) talking to the group the ' ufo : @entity39 ' documentary , airing next monday , will show how the @entity2 film crew were arrested at gunpoint			1
they were forced to lie on the ground for three hours as guards surrounded them armed with @entity45 assault rifles			2
the crew , 12 people in total , were investigating @entity4 in @entity49 - where the @entity7 military allegedly hold the bodies of aliens and the remnants of ships which crashed in @entity55 , @entity56 in 1947			1
as they crossed the border , military officers arrested them , confiscating their phones , wallets and identification			0
@entity11 told the @entity62 : ' basically the concept of the trip was to tour across @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity49 with comedian presenter @entity9 and four people who had an interest in the @entity12 phenomena			0
' we went to @entity4 in @entity49 firstly because it ’s related to the @entity12 phenomena and secondly so we could do a night time sky watch to see if we could spot anything unusual			1
' on may 14 we arrived there at approximately 5pm			0
' getting ready to cross : the team of 12 hesitate at the gates - and then decide to cross over all quiet ... the team were able to hang around on the border for 30 minutes without interruption ' we drove to the nearby township of @entity82 which is the closet public residency to @entity4 base and drove down a dirt road to the ‘ @entity86 ’ of @entity4 officially known as ‘ @entity87 ’			1
' we stopped the tour bus approx 50 metres from the restricted area barriers and started to film			0
' there was no one around , no guards , no vehicles - nothing			2
' we filmed for approximately 30 minutes and tried to call the guards but there was no one there and no sign of them			0
' so we all decided to walk past the barriers onto the restricted area past the security huts and basically onto @entity4			1
' taken within the base : the team managed a few images before they were captured , showing some of the out - houses of the base the back gate of @entity4 : the team risked six months in jail by entering he continued : ' we filmed again for another 30 minutes and even messed around doing a silly dance , but still no guards			1
' then one of the other stars of the trip pointed out that on looking through one of the security hut windows , she could see the guards all sitting down eating dinner and watching the basketball game on tv			0
' so after a few more minutes and a few more picture taking and filming , one of the crew decided to speak to the guards and knocked on their hut door			0
' ' the guards rushed out with their weapons and forced us all to lay face down at gunpoint in the tarmac			2
' we were all searched , had our phones , wallets and ids taken and the film equipment taken			0
this was at approx 6:15pm			0
' for three hours we lay face down until the @entity146 arrived on scene			2
' things then eased off a bit and we were all then taken one by one off the restricted area to the sheriffs who issued us with a ticket and grilled us about what we were doing			0
we all got fined £ 375 each			0
' we were told that this incident was so serious that @entity155 had to call @entity25 to advise that 12 ' @entity156 ' had just breached security at @entity7 's most top - secret military base and that we all were at one point going to jail for six months			1
' luckily whoever it was in @entity155 was kind enough to just fine us			1
' strange lights in the sky : it took three hours until the team could resume filming again ( ... and the strange light is just a searchlight ! ) the team spent three hours lying on the ground while their identities were checked - then @entity11 was allowed back to his car , where he took more sneaky images written order : this warning was given to the team as they left he continued : ' as time went on into the evening at approximately 11pm we were allowed to stand around together while things were signed off to let us go			1
' at this point i managed to talk to the guards a bit and one told me how they could ' make you disappear and your body will never be found '			0
@entity12 expert : @entity11 is a believer that @entity191 has visitors ' he also pointed out that an @entity194 attack helicopter had been scrambled and had been monitoring us from two miles away and that over 20 military guards had driven up from the actual base to deal with the incident			1
there were quite a few of them there with guns ! ' one guard i quizzed let slip that there are sensors in the ground that can detect approaching vehicles and walkers up in the nearby mountains , so they know if people are getting too close as they can not put fences up because the area is so big			0
' then at about 11:30pm we were allowed to leave on the bus and we went back to our hotel at the nearby town of @entity49			0
' because the film equipment had been taken by the @entity17 we had to wait to get new kit from @entity220 so we had a day of rest but we were followed everywhere by unmarked @entity223 vehicles			0
' they stuck out like a sore thumb to me			0
it was myself that pointed this out to the others otherwise they would not have been aware of being followed			0
' the following night i conducted a sky watch at the famous ‘ mailbox ’ which is really close to the @entity4 boundary and base , to see if we could see anything unusual or ufos			1
' i used a night vision device from a company called @entity240 and we were able to view the training area and nearby mountains			2
' it was probably the most messed - up day of my life so far - but i do n’t regret it at all			2
' the infamous white letter - box : this signpost is often listed on visitor guides as a sign that you are within 20 miles of the infamous base the road leading past the base became known - colloquially and then formally - as the @entity254 : @entity11 is pictured at the site the @entity55 crash has gone down in conspiracy theory circles as a @entity7 government cover up			1
believers say that aliens in a flying saucer crashed in @entity55 , @entity56 with badly injured aliens on board in june or july 1947			1
at the time spokesmen from @entity55 army air base said that a ' flying disc ' was found - but just hours later retracted the statement insisting instead that it was a weather balloon			1
the story took an interesting twist three years ago			0
lieutenant @entity270 was the public relations officer at the base in 1947			0
he was the man who issued the original and subsequent press releases after the crash on the orders of the base commander , colonel @entity275			2
@entity270 died in 2006 , but left a sworn affidavit to be opened only after his death			0
the text asserts that the weather balloon claim was a cover story , and that the real object had been recovered by the military and stored in a hangar			0
he described seeing not just the craft , but alien bodies			2
infamous : iconic image of the alien autopsy footage said to have been carried out after a @entity12 crash in 1947 video : ' alien autopsy ' footage ' leaked from @entity4 the same team caused outrage in a previous show which suggested the 7/7 attacks were co-ordinated by the government to boost support for the @entity30 war			1
the blasts killed 52 people when four suicide bombers detonated their home - made devices on tubes and a bus during the morning rush - hour commute			2
the producers destroyed a double - decker @entity25 bus in a bid to recreate the explosion in @entity310 that killed 13 people			1
it also featured conspiracy theorists - including model @entity314 - playing the parts of the bombers in a reconstruction of events			2
explosive : the team previously destroyed a @entity25 bus to explore the theory that the 7/7 bombings were a government plot to garner support for the ' war on terror ' carnage : thirteen people were killed when a bomb detonated on board the @entity333 bus in @entity310			1

agents held the 12 - man team at gunpoint for three hours while checking their credentials
@entity4 *rumoured* to hold the crashed space - ship as well as the bodies of aliens which were removed - still alive - from the *wreckage*
' @entity194 helicopters were called in and @entity155 phoned @entity25 after *trespass* '
team say they were followed in the days following attempt
same @entity2 team caused outrage by suggesting @entity25 bombings were a government conspiracy
