@entity0 has kept his mobile phone switched off and given his laptop away			1
' it 's like i have been living in the seventies these last few days , ' he said			1
in his first round since his bombshell split from his fiancee @entity8 , he kept the surprises coming by shooting in the sixties - a four under par 68 to be precise in the @entity11 at @entity12 on thursday			1
boost : @entity0 celebrates chipping in for an eagle during first round of the @entity11 lift : @entity0 is congratulated by @entity15 after holing his second shot on the seventh hole for an eagle @entity8 will head into @entity20 action nursing a broken heart and a dodgy left knee			1
@entity0 ’s ex-fiancee has had knee trouble for a while			1
she tweeted : ‘ it ’s a hard time for me right now			1
thanks for all the sweet messages ! happy i support @entity29 right now because i know i ’ll never walk alone			2
’ it still left him some distance behind the leader @entity32 , who shot an astounding 62 , but this was some effort , given all the circumstances			1
' everyone know what it feels like , ' said the 25 year old			2
you 're not sleeping and i 'm not comfortable standing here talking about it			2
but the object now is to bury my head in my golf and for the most part i did a pretty good job of that			2
' he certainly did , from the moment he had stood in the middle of the seventh fairway with his arms aloft and his face bathed in smiles			2
amazing what a holed wedge shot from 130 yards for an eagle two can do to lift the spirits of a man			2
centre of attention : all eyes were on @entity0 at @entity12 after he split up from @entity8 one to watch : spectators surrounded the third green to get a look at @entity0 in his opening round ' wear black for @entity70 ' was the theme of the opening day – the players were paying their respects to the popular caddie @entity75 , who died doing the job he loved in @entity77 recently – and suddenly , the predominant mood of this particular @entity70 was anything but black			1
how he seized on that enormous slice of good fortune			2
his approach had actually pitched 35ft beyond the flag before spinning back into the hole			2
five holes later he almost came up with an even more spectacular blow , as his five iron approach from 203 yards to the par five 12th finished three inches away			1
it was certainly a much better shot			2
' i 've not had an albatoss , ' he said			2
' it would have been nice if it had gone in , since it 's the one thing in golf my dad still has on me			0
' those two eagles took @entity0 to four under and on the leaderboard			1
he might be struggling with commitment off the course but there was no doubting his commitment to capitalise and return a morale - boosting score			0
out in front : @entity32 leads the tournament after shooting a stunning 62 in his first round pin - point accuracy : this approach to the 18th set up a birdie for @entity32 - the eighth of a stunning opening round @entity32 reigns in the rain : the umbrellas were up as @entity32 holed out to complete his first round after all his problems here since the controversial changes were instigated in 2010 – he 's not finished in the top 20 since – would n't it be ironic if this was the year he won the @entity120 's flagship event ? not that he 's thinking that way just yet , of course			1
' my golf is good enough but right now i ' d still be happy simply being around for the weekend , ' he said			0
a sense of black humour was needed at the start			0
itching for the relative quiet of a round inside the ropes , what happened when he got the hoopla of the opening hole out of the way ? the siren blew heralding a suspension of play owing to some electrical activity in the area			1
the heavy showers that punctuated the day 's proceedings actually helped @entity0 when he got back out , softening the greens and turning it into a target golf test			1
no - one prospered quite like @entity148 's renaissance man , @entity32			1
in a game where perfection is n't possible it 's hardly surprising players invariably finish even great rounds thinking it could still have been one or two shots better			0
not bjorn on this day			0
this was the 1,421st round of his long and distinguished @entity120 career , and he had no trouble ranking it			1
' it 's the best one , ' he said			0
to shoot 62 on this golf course , you could n't ask for more			1
' wet and wild : the rain hammered down at @entity12 as play was suspended twice ruled out : @entity169 has been forced to withdraw from the tournament with a knee injury after an opening round of 73 yet @entity32 had started out with low expectations			1
the @entity174 played horribly in @entity175 last week and admitted his patience was fraying at the edges when he continued to struggle in practice here			0
to complete the picture , his pitiful record at @entity12 showed just one top ten in 16 previous appearances			1
how to explain what happened next , as one of the great ball strikers of the last 20 years gave a consummate demonstration of his class ? ' i do n't really know where to start , ' he said			0
' with my record here and after last week , i certainly did n't come here thinking , oh this is going to be a great week			0
i guess i 've got to stick my head down now and focus on what lies ahead			0
' what lies ahead is the prospect of removing any lingering uncertainty regarding his @entity199 place , although there 's not much of that given he lies third in the qualifying table			0
he can also consolidate his position as leader in the race to @entity209			0
after a couple of lean years , why is it all going right again for the 43 year old ? ' hard work and determination not to let a golf career fade away , ' he said			0
' you get to that stage in your life where you can see the end and you 've got to make decisions			0
it did n't take me long to decide i wanted to enjoy this last bit , and i 'll continue to work hard and enjoy it for as long as my body allows			0
' elsewhere , @entity225 showed the pride of a major champion to card a 70 after starting with three straight bogeys while @entity229 , labouring all week with a bad back , matched him			0
@entity231 and @entity232 shot 71 but not everyone enjoyed themselves			0
defending champion @entity235 tumbled to an 80 .			0

@entity0 had two eagles in a four under par 68 in first round
