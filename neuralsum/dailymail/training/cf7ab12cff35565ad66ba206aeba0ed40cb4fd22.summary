you might have seen incredible images of coral before , but you 've never seen anything like this			1
phd student @entity6 from the @entity7 , @entity5 has spent months photographing and filming supposedly ' slow ' marine animals like coral and sponges , and the results will blow you away			1
using time - lapse photography , he shows how these seemingly stationary underwater marvels come to life under high magnification , highlighting remarkable details and behaviours that scientists around the world still do n't fully understand			1
scroll down for the full video @entity6 took 150,000 shots with high - end cameras and lenses to create beautiful time - lapses of marine life by stitching the images together , @entity6 was able to show how corals and sponges we think as stationary come to life over time in weird and wonderful ways although they play a crucial role in @entity36 's biosphere , we know very little about this rather sedate marine life it took over nine months for @entity6 to film the corals and sponges in marine aquarium tanks			1
while he did n't disclose the full price of the endeavour , @entity6 did say that it cost ' way more ' than a few thousand dollars			2
' i love marine life , especially invertebrates and i always look for something new to observe , film , or photograph , ' @entity6 tells @entity49			1
' when i got my first chance to focus my macro lens on a coral i realised that i want to know more about these magnificent creatures , their colours and their life			2
' once i started photographing corals more often , pursuing time lapses was inevitable			1
' despite filming the marine life in enclosed tanks and having friends in the industry , @entity6 says he does not endorse the activities of commercial coral collectors and hopes the video allows people to appreciate the value of such life in the @entity67 in @entity5 and elsewhere			1
' my techniques are too complex to be performed under water , ' says @entity6 , ' especially focus stacking where any vibrations or swell would ruin the super-macro shot			2
' focus stacking is the technique that gave the most spectacular results and allowed me to capture incredible amount of detail			0
' that 's why i had to look for help among people whose activities i do not endorse - aquarists and commercial coral collectors			2
' marine aquarium industry is quite large here in @entity5 and a lot of people create artificial reefs at home			1
' so , all filming was done in tanks and due to my position i did not buy a single coral or live rock , i did not keep a tank at home or in anyway contribute to the industry			0
i tried to film freshly collected animals before they are sold and shipped to other countries to be put in private tanks			1
' up close you can see some of the incredible details on various pieces of coral and sponges here a coral known as a fungia can be seen excavating itself from sand and silt , which piles on top of it over time the @entity67 covers 1,429 miles and is so large it can be seen from outer space			1
marine creatures include 600 types of soft and hard corals , more than 100 species of jellyfish , 3000 varieties of molluscs , 500 species of worms , 1625 types of fish , 133 varieties of sharks and rays , and more than 30 species of whales and dolphins			0
it extends south from the northern tip of @entity134 in north - eastern @entity5 to just north of @entity135			0
the reef is an at risk @entity138 listed site that @entity140 believes could become an ' in danger ' later this year			0
a lot of interesting aspects of coral and sponge biology can be seen in the gorgeous time - lapses			2
some of the events happen over long periods of time , such as at night when some corals open up and extend their tentacles			0
' a fun part to watch is seeing how brittle stars clean sponges , ' says @entity6			2
' brittle stars are relatives of sea stars and sea urchins			0
' they have long flexible arms with which they can collect random stuff sediments that fall on sponge surface			0
' i did not know about such symbiosis until i saw it it in my time lapses and then read it in a research paper after looking up for information			1
' @entity169 's is all the more impressive as he had to juggle taking the shots with being a phd student			1
the longest part he says was processing the images			0
' often i had to wait days to process a sequence to realize that i 've done mistakes and had to do it over			0
' one frame could easily take more than 10 minutes of processing time			0
' the groundbreaking video reveals some unknown aspects of the deep blue sea that we are yet to understand @entity6 hopes the video will serve as a reminder as to how precious and wonderful reefs like the @entity67 are each frame of the video was a ' stack ' consisting of three to 12 shots , with the in - focus areas merged to highlight aspects of the coral and sponges with the video @entity6 says he hopes to show a unique perspective of the @entity67 and attract attention to the problems that it is facing			1
' @entity5 government approved industrialisation of the area that will have devastating consequences			0
' ignoring these problems and creating artificial reefs at homes instead of protecting the reef is , unfortunately , is very common			0
' watching the marine aquarium industry from inside during the filming process made me extremely concerned about priorities of those who often claim themselves to be reef lovers			0

a phd student from the @entity7 , @entity5 has put together an incredible video of coral life
marine biologist @entity6 created the film to show the secret life of the ' slow ' marine animals
the corals and sponges were filmed under high magnification to show their amazing and *bizarre* features
but they move so slowly that their *motion* is only *detectable* by using time lapses
although coral reefs such as this are crucial to @entity36 's biosphere , we still know very little about them
' once i started photographing corals more often , pursuing time lapses was inevitable '
