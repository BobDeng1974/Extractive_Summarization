' that he knew nothing of the false registration of voters , of the diversion of public funds to pay for his support ... or of fraud			2
an innocent amidst a den of iniquity			0

quoting ancient @entity125 playwright @entity123 , he added : ‘ @entity2 would not “ rather fail with honour than succeed by fraud ”			2
’ opposition : four residents , @entity55 , left , @entity56 , @entity57 , right , and @entity58 , plan to call 100 witnesses to prove the election was rigged historic : the @entity1 is hearing the rare electoral trial , which could result in a new election , mayor @entity2 being suspended or banned from office or completely exhonerated before election day last year , residents – ‘ often elderly and with little @entity136 ’ – would be approached by canvassers with applications for postal votes , mr @entity28 said			1
