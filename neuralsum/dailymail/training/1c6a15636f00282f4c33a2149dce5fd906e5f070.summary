@entity0 pulled out of the @entity2 slopestyle contest wednesday after being dinged up on a course that riders are criticizing as unduly harsh			1
@entity0 issued a statement , saying that after much deliberation , he has decided to forgo the new high - speed , obstacle - filled snowboarding event and concentrate on snagging a third straight gold on the halfpipe next week			1
' with the practice runs i have taken , even after course modifications and watching fellow athletes get hurt , the potential risk of injury is a bit too much for me to gamble my other @entity19 goals on , ' @entity0 said in a statement			2
scroll down for @entity21 too treacherous ? snowboarding @entity2 gold medalist and favorite to win the @entity25 games @entity0 has withdrawn from the slopestyle event after he and others characterized the course as a little too dangerous @entity0 , who was among the favorites in the new @entity2 event , jammed his left wrist during practice tuesday and when he came off the slopestyle course , he called it ' a little intimidating			1
' the announcement comes despite @entity0 's claims that his wrist injury was a non-issue			1
' it 's one of those things that it 's going to be annoying , but i do n't think it will affect my performance , ' @entity0 told @entity44 after the injury			2
slopestyle is a speed - packed trip down the mountain , filled with rails , bumps and , most notably , steeply angled jumps that allow riders to flip two , sometimes three times , before landing			1
@entity0 hurt his wrist on one of the takeoff ramps , which one top rider , @entity59 @entity58 , said were built ' kind of obnoxiously tall			1
' @entity0 , 27 , has been dealing with a number of nagging injuries during a winter in which he was one of the few riders trying to compete in both events			1
the wrist added to a list that includes his shoulder and ankle , both injured during qualifying events for the @entity71 team			1
slippery slope : here , @entity0 takes a jump during a slopestyle training session at the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , prior to the 2014 @entity19 not the only one : @entity0 is one of several snowboarders who 've been injured practicing on @entity25 's slopestyle course , including a @entity81 medal contender who broke his collarbone monday his focus will now solely be on next tuesday 's contest in the halfpipe , which is essentially a hollowed - out ice shell with 22 - foot sidewalls			1
there is danger there , but unlike slopestyle , it 's based mostly on the types of tricks the riders try and not the setup of the pipe			2
in a news conference about an hour before he gave first word of his decision to the today show , @entity0 was asked whether halfpipe was more important to him			2
' for me , i definitely feel the halfpipe carries a bit more weight , a bit more pressure			2
i guess that 's fair enough to say , ' he said			0
he deemed his jammed wrist as nothing serious and said reports about it were overblown			2
but he said there remained serious issues with the slopestyle course			0
' there are definitely concerns about the course , ' he said			0
' it 's been interesting to see how it 's developed and changed over the past couple days			0
the big question is , if it will continue to change			0
because every day , they have riders meetings and they give feedback			0
sometimes there 's changes , sometimes there 's not			0
' @entity126 of @entity59 's team said the slopestyle course felt like ' jumping out of a building , ' according to @entity130			0
@entity132 's @entity131 agreed , calling the course ' pretty sketchy			0
' ' i just do n't want to get injured			0
it 's not a really fun course to ride , ' @entity131 said			0
dangerous : @entity81 's @entity137 was stretchered off the mountain monday after injuring after breaking his collarbone on the very course @entity0 has decided not to vie for gold on			1

the snowboarder wants to focus on a third straight halfpipe @entity2 gold
the @entity25 down - mountain , obstacle - filled slopestyle course is being called *unnecessarily* dangerous
@entity0 , 27 , was one of the few snowboarders competing in both events until he injured his wrist tuesday
