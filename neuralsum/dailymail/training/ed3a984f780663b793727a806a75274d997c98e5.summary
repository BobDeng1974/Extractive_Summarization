violent tackles by @entity2 ’s @entity1 , a lack of protection for @entity5 and @entity6 and @entity7 at war with the world			1
@entity10 too had reason to complain after numerous penalty appeals were rejected ( although they did it a little more quietly ) and so referees are again back in the spotlight			2
@entity17 ’s panel of experts , @entity19 , @entity20 and former top referee @entity21 , got together to discuss the fall - out			1
@entity23 @entity22 asked the questions and listened in			2
@entity17 trio @entity21 ( left ) , @entity19 ( centre ) and @entity20 ( right ) have aired their views on the weekend 's refereeing controversy q : describe the current standard of refereeing in three words please , gents			1
poll : inconsistent , inaccurate , outdated			2
but i want to qualify that			2
working as a co-commentator for the @entity38 , i understand their difficulty			0
i sometimes need two or three replays to see what has happened at high speed			0
we should always try to remember that			0
what is most irritating , however , is when it happens right under their noses and they fail to see what is blindingly obvious			0
@entity19 : you asked for three words , did n’t you ? honest			1
@entity57 players and managers have to take their share of the blame too for causing this crisis ? poll : of course ! it ’s players more than managers			2
@entity66 has never been harder			0
players exaggerate or even simulate contact and go down so easily that you struggle to believe what you are seeing			0
the way they roll around as if injured to get opponents in trouble is embarrassing to watch			0
look at @entity73 on saturday after he was fouled by @entity1			0
managers are understandably frustrated at some of the very poor decisions this season but they should try and help rather than attack			0
@entity1 ( right ) catches @entity73 with his right boot during an aerial challenge this studs - up tackle from @entity1 ( centre ) infuriated @entity7 midfielder @entity83 ( right ) @entity84 shows the red card to @entity83 after the @entity87 midfielder retaliated to the tackle @entity84 ( right ) can not see the full extent of @entity1 ’ horror challenge as @entity83 is blocking his view @entity20 : there certainly needs to be more honesty			1
players have introduced confusion by diving , so is it a foul , or not ? also , i ’m not buying this ‘ agenda ’ claim from @entity6			1
his latest outburst is a contrived attempt at cranking up the pressure on officials			0
there is no campaign against him			0
@entity10 manager @entity109 had just as many reasons to be furious at the weekend , but he rises above it			1
@entity83 reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from @entity1 @entity73 fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of @entity118 former @entity120 defender @entity20 has praised @entity109 for his conduct , despite a number of decisions going against his @entity10 side at the weekend @entity19 : is there really a crisis ? yes , there is diving , but get used to it , it is here to stay			1
referees have made mistakes this weekend , but it ’s only because of the attention applied by @entity6 that we are having this debate			1
look , the game is so quick , the rewards are so high and everyone is looking to gain an advantage , but behaviour towards referees is n’t any worse than when i was playing			0
ask @entity21 ! @entity6 ( right ) shouts at former referee poll during a @entity144 clash in may 2007 q : @entity5 is being kicked all over the place , so does @entity6 have a point – are @entity7 being mistreated ? @entity19 : hazard is so quick , of course he will be tripped and draw fouls			1
they are trips , kicks			0
there is nothing malicious behind it			0
and @entity7 are not being mistreated			1
come on ! they are a team of men , they have every trick in the book themselves			0
@entity20 : my only concern with @entity5 is this : is he always being fouled , or is he buying the foul ? he ’s a brilliant footballer , i love it when he runs with the ball , but he is difficult to referee because he lightening quick			1
as for @entity7 … they are not mistreated , but they ’ve had some poor calls			1
@entity5 was fouled a remarkable nine times during @entity7 's @entity172 clash against @entity173 @entity174 ( left ) goes in with studs showing on @entity5 during the encounter at the @entity177 poll : @entity7 have not had the rub of the green , they ’ve been unlucky			1
one could argue that @entity6 has brought this on himself with his constant bleating , but the main point must be that however the @entity7 manager behaves , referees must see each individual incident on its own merits and deal with it accordingly			1
as for @entity5 , yes , he needs better protection ( as does @entity192 – to stop him taking the law into his own hands )			0
they are outstanding footballers and we do n’t want them kicked out of matches			0
@entity7 's @entity192 reacts after not being awarded a penalty during saturday 's match against @entity2 q : do big clubs try to bully and influence referees in a game - management style ? is this new ? @entity20 : the aggressive behaviour of players is n’t new , especially when they swarm around the referee			1
it ’s unpalatable , but i remember @entity21 once accusing us at @entity120 of ‘ being too nice ’ and to ‘ get around the referee ’ in a game against @entity212			1
@entity213 is the leader of the pack now			0
he runs faster towards a row involving the referee than he does in the rest of the game ! he will argue his captain ’s armband gives him the right to be there , but there is more to it than that			2
@entity213 ( right ) remonstrates with referee @entity84 after the latter sent off @entity83 @entity19 : sir @entity228 demanded it of his teams too and then followed up by pursuing the referee down the tunnel			1
his @entity212 team were good at it , they won key decisions because of it			1
@entity6 is trying it now			1
poll : players will try to influence referees , they always have			2
referees have to be strong and they must n’t be influenced by it			0
@entity228 was the past master at it and was better at it than anyone around at the moment			2
he had a fear factor that @entity6 does not have			1
@entity228 ( middle ) had history of pursuing referees down the tunnel when he was a manager @entity7 boss @entity6 speaking on @entity252 ' goals on sunday programme during the weekend q : what can be done to help officials ? poll : to solve any problem one must first accept that there is one			1
select referees need better support , motivation and direction			0
look at @entity84 on saturday at @entity7 and you see a man fatigued			2
just back from a trip to @entity268 where he focused on performing to get to @entity269 2016 he looked tired and lethargic			0
after all it was ‘ only @entity7 v @entity2 ’			2
he missed blatant offences which , if he were at his best , he would not have			0
@entity19 : a radical change would be a referee in each half , like two umpires in hockey			1
but , before that , we must allow retrospective punishment , even if the @entity281 have to overrule the officials			0
how can @entity1 get away with his tackles at @entity7 on saturday ? if the referee misreads it or misunderstands what he has seen , he must have the chance to rectify it , or else he looks stupid and football looks stupid			1
they need help , so please let ’s help them			0
@entity20 : i agree with retrospective punishment , but they also need to help themselves			2
when a player has had a bad game , he goes straight on the training pitch and begins preparing for the next match and the chance to put it right			0
referees ca n’t do that			0
i ’d like to see the elite group refereeing midweek under - 21 matches , which would give them the chance to restore confidence and also the opportunity to build relationships with the next generation of players			2
poll believes @entity84 is fatigued and as a result is not at his best resulting in his recent below - par display q : who are the three top referees in the country ? poll : @entity322 , @entity323 and @entity324 @entity20 : i do n’t disagree with @entity322 and @entity323 , but i ’m struggling to find any more			1
@entity326 is a good referee and took charge of the @entity328 last season , but was then injured and it coming back via the championship			2
it ’s a damning indictment that there are n’t more			0
@entity19 : @entity323 is the best , no question			1
none of the others stand out – as i said to the first question , they are honest people , whose performances have been average this season and they have a difficult job			0
@entity19 regards @entity323 as the best @entity345 referee in the business , bar none			1
