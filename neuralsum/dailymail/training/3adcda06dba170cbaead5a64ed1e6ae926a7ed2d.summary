a gray wolf killed by a @entity3 hunter may have been @entity4 - a female who attracted national attention after wandering through several states to become the first of the protected animals seen at @entity11 's @entity10 in 70 years , officials said on tuesday			1
the hunter , who was not named by authorities , told @entity3 wildlife officers on sunday that he accidentally shot and killed a wolf equipped with a radio collar near the @entity11 border after mistaking it for a coyote			1

the @entity28 released this photo in october of the gray wolf that was spotted at the @entity10 - the first sighting of the species in more than 70 years there			2
it is believed that a gray wolf killed on sunday in @entity3 may be the same creature , named @entity4 wandering lone wolf : the three - year - old female 's epic journey from the @entity39 to the @entity10 sadly came to an end on sunday when she was shot dead by a hunter in @entity3 the incident , which is coming under sharp criticism by conservationists , is being investigated by federal and state conservation officers as a possible violation of @entity21 and @entity3 wildlife laws , authorities said			1
information gleaned from the radio collar shows the wolf killed in @entity3 was a three - year - old female that was captured and collared in january in northwest @entity54 , said @entity56 spokesman @entity55			1
the wolf spotted near the northern rim of the @entity10 in october was also a young female , which had apparently roamed hundreds of miles south from the @entity61 , according to an analysis of droppings near where she was seen			2
it may be weeks before additional testing reveals whether the wolf killed in @entity3 is the same one , which was nicknamed @entity4 in a contest			1
@entity4 was the first gray wolf seen in the @entity10 and the adjacent national forest since the 1940s , when the last wolf there was killed as part of an extensive eradication campaign , said @entity75 with the @entity76			2

but the farther they go , the less likely they are to find a mate , said @entity88 , who led recovery efforts for wolves in the @entity61 over two decades before retiring from the @entity76 in 2011			0
' it 's looking for love , ' he said in october			0
' it leaves the core population and does n't know the love of its life is going to be right over the next hill , so it just keeps traveling			0
' analysis of the animal 's scat while it was in @entity11 in october showed it had traveled hundreds of miles from the @entity61 in @entity54 the gray wolf is protected under the @entity21 @entity20 in most states			1

@entity3 regulations require hunters to properly identify their target before shooting but cases of mistaken identity sometimes happen , @entity55 said			2
