@entity1 defender @entity0 is ready to make his return from an horrific double leg break in tuesday 's @entity5 tie at @entity6			1
the @entity8 international suffered the injury against @entity10 in an @entity12 fourth round game in january and was forced to miss the @entity13			1
@entity1 boss @entity14 said : ' the really good news is that @entity0 is in the squad for the first time since breaking his leg			1
' @entity1 defender @entity0 trains at @entity19 , @entity20 last week ahead of his return to action striker @entity23 could also play at the @entity24 following an 11 - month layoff with a knee injury , but @entity27 and @entity28 are definitely out			1
@entity1 are looking to bounce back from sunday 's 3 - 2 home @entity30 defeat to @entity32			1
the result means that , ahead of saturday 's derby trip to @entity20 , the @entity1 have conceded 13 goals in the opening five games of their league campaign , the worst defensive record in the division			1
but @entity14 insists there is no problem with his players ' attitude towards defending			2
' we had two very good performances defensively ( a 4 - 1 @entity49 home victory over @entity50 and 2 - 0 @entity30 win at @entity52 ) previous to that ( the @entity32 match ) , so it is not that there is a problem that has been developing , ' @entity14 said			2
@entity0 suffered a double leg break in january but is now ready to return against @entity6 on tuesday ' i do think that the performance and clean sheet against @entity52 brought our defensive intensity back to our play			1
' i think it was back against @entity50 as well , and yesterday was just a bit different			2
' unfortunately we made a couple of bad decisions and errors which cost us goals			0
but i do n't think it 's the case of a lack of a defensive attitude of the team			2
' it was a very rare game			0
the spooky side of it was that we replicated against @entity32 the performance we had in april , with the same scoreline			0
but we will learn from it			0
' @entity1 manager @entity14 ( left ) watches on as his side lose 3 - 2 to @entity32 @entity14 once again dismissed the idea that his side had any kind of @entity49 hangover following their clash with @entity50 on thursday			1
he said : ' no , it was n't that			0
if it had been that we could n't find our rhythm or our normal way of playing because we were tired or did n't have the energy , i would say that was down to the fact we played an extra game on thursday			0
' but that was n't the case at all - if anything , it was the opposite			2
if you watched the first 15 or 20 minutes , we were the ones with the real intent on the ball			0
we looked fresh and were penetrating			0
' all in all , i felt the players who came in were ready			0

@entity0 is back in the @entity1 squad for tuesday 's @entity5 match away to @entity6
the @entity8 defender missed the @entity13 after suffering a double leg break in january
@entity111 could also play following an 11 - month layoff with a knee injury
