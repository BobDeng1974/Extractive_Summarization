the city of @entity1 is facing a possible lawsuit after telling a woman she could n't pass out free bottled water to people in @entity7 's 112 - degree heat			1
@entity8 said she and a religious group were offering the water at a downtown festival in july as a kind gesture and to offer conversation on their @entity15 faith when told they were violating a city code			1
' it was really hot and yeah we wanted to show @entity21 's love and a small act of kindness is a great way to do that without shoving it down someone 's throat , ' she told @entity29 15			2
non-profit civil liberties organization @entity40 has since offered to represent ms @entity8 against the city			2
they claim her first amendment rights were violated and her claimed need of a permit was unjustified under the city 's code itself			1
' in fact , the @entity1 's @entity51 prohibits only " vending " on @entity51 sidewalks without a license agreement , â€™ the institute wrote in a letter to the city earlier this month			2
violation : ms @entity8 was passing out bottles like this one shown when told the gesture was in violation of a city code with her not having a permit ' having read a @entity67 passage referencing the importance of small acts of kindness such as offering water to the thirsty , ms @entity8 was further moved to offer cold bottles of water to people at the @entity75 who were braving the desert 's scorching 112 - degree heat , ' the institute wrote			1
' i do n't even think it 's about religious beliefs , i think anybody should be able to give away water , on the side walk to anybody			0
it 's hot , and it 's a nice thing to do , ' ms @entity8 said			0
the @entity40 has since notified the city that they will file a lawsuit unless an apology is issued , they agree to train city workers on first amendment rights and assure to never interfere with her distribution of water again			0
' it is beyond comprehension that local government officials would interfere with citizens performing such a basic act of charity as giving water to the thirty in your city , ' the institute wrote			0
