passengers could soon see the end of liquid limits at airports thanks to an innovative new scanner			1
the award - winning technology is currently on trial at @entity9 and @entity10 airports in @entity11 and 63 airports in @entity13 and @entity14 , where it is playing a vital role in allowing passengers to eventually carry standard containers for drinks , cosmetics and toiletries			1
with the aim of stopping threats and speeding up queues , the table - top machine uses a laser to analyse the liquid contents of bottles – without opening them – for bomb ingredients at airport security checkpoints			2
air travellers are currently banned from carrying liquids over 100ml in their hand baggage , and the smaller containers must be placed in clear plastic bags			1
it leads to extra delays for those who fail to prepare ahead of time and more waste as many travellers are forced to throw out full containers that are too large			0
the rule was implemented in 2006 after authorities foiled a terror plot to use liquid explosives to blow up several aircraft travelling from @entity9 to the @entity51 and @entity71			1
it is the @entity73 ’s goal to lift the ban and screen all liquids , lotions , powders and gels by january 2016 using technology such as @entity43 ’s @entity80			1
the company ’s liquid explosive detection system is able to scan containers up to three litres in size , and its new @entity86 version allows airport screeners to inspect metallic containers			2
@entity43 says the chemical analysis is rapid and accurate , and its reliability reduces delays and costs associated with missed flights , confiscations and extra security personnel			2
he told @entity97 : ‘ it ’s part of the solution towards the legislation that is aiming to lift the restrictions on carrying liquids into cabin baggage over the next few years			1
future uses ? @entity43 says the scanner could one day be used for non-invasive cancer screening passengers are currently banned from carrying liquids over 100ml in their hand baggage the @entity80 uses a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in containers up to three litres in size without opening them			1
it uses a technique called @entity118 spectroscopy to determine the chemical make - up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials			2
the scanner works by firing a laser into the liquid at different angles			0
a small proportion of light penetrates the surface of the liquid and bounces back to give the scanner data			0
it then subtracts data about the container from the overall reading to leave it with a faint signal from the liquid			0
it cross-checks the remaining information with a library of dangerous liquids			0
and all this takes just five seconds			0
the machine is able to separate harmless ingredients from those like hydrogen peroxide that can be used to make bombs			0
‘ it ’s only part of the solution but it enables ultimately passengers to carry liquids in the way they used to do prior to 2006			1
’ the false alarm rate at the 65 airports is less than one per cent and the average scan time is three seconds or less			1
mr @entity53 said the false alarm rate is key because erroneous scans can lead to delays			0
the £ 40,000 device has earned @entity43 widespread praise and attention , and led to growth within the firm			2
earlier this year , @entity43 received the @entity164 from the @entity165 , the @entity167 ’s premier engineering prize			1
and there are plans to use the technology for other purposes			0
in addition to identifying liquid explosives , @entity172 said the machine could one day be used for non-invasive cancer screening or detecting narcotics , precursors and toxic chemicals , and counterfeit products .			0

award - winning technology was created by @entity47
it is on trial at 65 airports , including @entity9 and @entity10
passengers banned from carrying liquids over 100ml in hand baggage
@entity73 hopes to lift ban by january 2016
@entity43 won the @entity167 ’s premier engineering prize earlier this year
