@entity0 will lay down the law to @entity2 over what they expect from him as he closes in on a £ 16million move to @entity5			1
@entity7 ’ summer - long search for a top - class striker has led him to @entity2 , the @entity9 forward who he said two weeks ago would ‘ categorically not be at @entity0 ’			1
however , an about - turn by @entity7 has seen @entity0 agree a deal with @entity13 to sign @entity2			1
they initially enquired about taking him for a season but were quoted an exorbitant loan fee			0
nevertheless , @entity0 officials met @entity2 ’s representatives in a city centre hotel on thursday night and made it clear that they would expect absolute commitment from the former @entity45 @entity13 forward , on and off the field			1
@entity2 ’s career has been littered with bizarre episodes , such as setting off fireworks in his bathroom , and they want guarantees from him there will be no more erratic behaviour			1
if @entity2 is not willing to accept , @entity0 would walk away and look at other targets , headed by @entity55			2
this move , though , comes after @entity0 have done significant research into his character and @entity7 believes @entity2 has the tools to help his side develop in the @entity27 and the @entity61			1
more significantly , it is felt he will thrive in the environment at @entity0 ’s @entity65 training base , where @entity7 has built a tightly knit group that is strong enough to cope with the arrival of such a larger - than - life figure			1
some will wonder why , after selling @entity70 , @entity0 are prepared to take another gamble but @entity73 columnist @entity72 feels @entity7 ’ man - management would help @entity2			1
‘ the main thing for any player is what he does on the pitch , ’ said @entity72			2
‘ both players had issues off the pitch , but i think it ’s fair to say @entity70 did a lot more on the pitch			0
would @entity2 be the final piece of the jigsaw ? would he make the starting @entity88 if everyone was fit and firing ? who knows ? ’ striker : @entity2 scored 30 goals in 80 games for @entity45 before moving back to @entity9 flashpoint : @entity2 had a number of run - ins during his explosive relationship with @entity97 although @entity2 was a controversial figure off the field at @entity45 , he was a relative success on it during his three years at the club between 2010 and 2013			1
after his £ 24m move from @entity104 he helped @entity45 win their first @entity27 title , won the @entity106 and @entity107 and scored 30 goals in 50 starts			1
having invested £ 101m to give their squad depth during this window , @entity0 have been the @entity27 ’s biggest spenders but the one problem area for @entity7 was finding a top - class front man to work alongside — and provide competition for — @entity116			1
they initially had a deal in place for @entity119 of @entity120 but called it off at the 11th hour because of a discrepancy with his medical			0
@entity0 then turned to @entity124 ’s @entity123 , whom they would have paid £ 12million to take for a season			2
@entity123 never gave any encouragement , which then led them to @entity55 and finally @entity2			0
should talks continue to run as smoothly as they have done , there is potential for the deal to be completed at some point during the weekend			0
the move would leave @entity13 in the market for a new striker and may cause a domino effect that could see @entity138 misfit @entity137 head for the @entity139 , to be replaced at @entity140 by @entity119			0
@entity137 has not been a success since his £ 26m move from @entity143 last summer , thursday night ’s goal against @entity146 notwithstanding			2
he is set to continue under new manager @entity147 as understudy to @entity149 in a system with only one central striker			0
spurs are keen to move for unsettled @entity153 striker @entity119 , but they have such a large squad that they do not want to bloat it further without moving players out			0
couple : the @entity19 striker and his partner @entity159 in @entity160 over the summer sending a message : @entity2 with his famous ' @entity163 ? ' t - shirt at @entity164 in 2011 @entity165 is another who is available and @entity166 are interested if they sell centre - half @entity168 , who is closing in on a move to @entity171 after rejecting @entity172			2
@entity166 officials have been in @entity174 this week			0
they like @entity175 and have a familiar route of negotiation through @entity138 ’s technical director @entity178 , but are also looking at @entity45 ’s @entity179			0
@entity147 has been chasing @entity181 defender @entity180 but have hit a snag unravelling the @entity184 ’s complicated ownership history , and are also considering @entity186 ’s @entity185 , another @entity184			0
