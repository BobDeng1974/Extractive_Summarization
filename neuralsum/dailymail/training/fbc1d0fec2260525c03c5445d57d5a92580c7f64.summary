by @entity0 our methods of finding planets outside the solar system are still very primitive , but we 're now getting a stage where we can start taking photos of them			0
and doing just that , known as direct imaging , a gas giant has been spotted around a star three times less massive than our sun. but what is most striking about this planet , dubbed @entity15 , is the huge distance at which it orbits its host star - about 2,000 times further than @entity20 is from the sun , a record among exoplanets			1
a gas giant planet , artist 's impression shown , has been found in an orbit around a star that takes 80,000 years			1
it is one of the most distant planets from a star that has yet been discovered			2
it is located around @entity15 , a star three times less massive than the @entity37 and located in the constellation @entity38 the international research team , led by @entity45 , a phd student in the @entity46 at the @entity47 , was able to find this planet by combining observations from the the @entity50 , the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) and the @entity41			1
@entity51 time taken to orbit : 87.9 days @entity53 224.7 days @entity20 365.25 days @entity54 686.9 days @entity55 11.9 years @entity56 29.4 years @entity57 84.3 years @entity58 164.8 years @entity59 247.7 years @entity60 560.2 years @entity62 b 80,000 years given its distance from its star , it takes approximately 80,000 @entity20 years for @entity15 b to make a complete orbit			1
the researchers also took advantage of the large distance between the planet and its star to obtain images			1
by comparing images obtained in different wavelengths ( or colours ) from the @entity43 and @entity40 , they were able to correctly detect the planet			0
' planets are much brighter when viewed in infrared rather than visible light , because their surface temperature is lower compared to other stars , ' says @entity45			0
' this allowed us to identify @entity15 b. ' the researchers were looking around @entity15 because the star had just been identified as a member of the young star group @entity88			1
young stars ( only 100 million years old ) are prime targets for planetary detection through imaging because the planets around them are still cooling and are therefore brighter			0
this does not mean that planets similar to @entity15 exist in large numbers , as noted by by @entity97 , co-supervisor of @entity45 's thesis and astrophysicist at the @entity47			1
' we observed more than 90 stars and found only one planet , so this is truly an astronomical oddity , ' he says			0
here the planet @entity15 b and its star gu @entity108 are composed of visible and infrared images			1
because infrared light is invisible to the naked eye , astronomers use a color code in which infrared light is represented by the color red			0
@entity15 b is brighter in infrared than in other filters , which is why it appears red in this image to determine other characteristics of the planet , including its mass , researchers used theoretical models of planetary evolution			2
the light spectrum of the planet @entity15 obtained from the @entity128 in @entity129 was compared to such models to show that it has a temperature of around 800 ° @entity133 )			2
knowing the age of the @entity136 due to its location in @entity88 , the team was able to determine the mass of the planet , which is nine to 13 times that of @entity55			0
in the coming years , the astrophysicists hope to detect planets that are similar to @entity15 but much closer to their stars , thanks , among other things , to new instruments such as the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) recently installed on @entity147 in @entity148			2
the proximity of these planets to their stars will make them much more difficult to observe			0
@entity15 b is therefore a model for better understanding these objects			0
the discovery was made by combining observations from the the @entity147 ( in the foreground ) , the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , the @entity40 ( @entity40 , shown in the background ) and the @entity41 ' @entity15 b is a true gift of nature , ' says @entity160 , co-supervisor of @entity45 's thesis and @entity162			0
' the large distance that separates it from its star allows it to be studied in depth with a variety of instruments , which will provide a better understanding of giant exoplanets in general			1
' the team has started a project to observe several hundred stars and detect planets lighter than @entity15 b with similar orbits			2
the discovery of @entity15 , a rare object indeed , raises awareness of the significant distance that can exist between planets and their stars , opening the possibility of searching for planets with powerful infrared cameras using much smaller telescopes such at the one at the @entity42 du @entity42			1
the researchers also hope to learn more about the abundance of such objects in the next few years using instruments such as @entity193 's upcoming @entity192 .			0

a gas giant planet has been found in a large orbit around a distant star
called @entity15 b it takes the planet 80,000 years to complete an orbit
it is 2,000 times further from its star than @entity20 is from the sun
this distance , a record among exoplanets , has allowed it to be imaged
and it could lead to the discovery of smaller planets in tighter orbits
