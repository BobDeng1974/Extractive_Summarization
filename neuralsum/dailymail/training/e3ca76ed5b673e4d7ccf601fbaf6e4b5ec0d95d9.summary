by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 05:20 est , 18 march 2013 @entity2 is storming ahead of the @entity3 when it comes to pleasing right - of - centre voters on policies of government spending , immigration and gay marriage , a poll revealed today			1
the voters , who are undecided over which of the two parties to vote for , also told the survey that @entity2 's @entity14 is a better party leader than prime minister @entity15 by 37 to 32 per cent			1
the ‘ switchers ’ would prefer @entity17 mayor @entity16 to mr @entity15 as @entity19 leader and would put home secretary @entity20 in third place , the @entity23 survey for @entity24 said			2
favourites : voters who are undecided over which of the two parties to vote for told the survey that @entity2 's @entity14 ( left ) is a better party leader than prime minister @entity15 ( right ) by 37 to 32 per cent the findings come two weeks after @entity2 pushed the conservatives into an embarrassing third place in the by - election in @entity33 , @entity34 , which was won by the @entity36 candidate @entity35			1
there are concerns within the @entity19 party that @entity2 will split their vote at the local elections in may , which could result in a strong result for @entity43 and put even more pressure on mr @entity15			0
but the poll revealed that mr @entity15 ’s policy on holding an ‘ in / out ’ referendum on @entity50 's @entity49 membership is favoured by all voters when compared to @entity2 ’s plan of leaving immediately			0
the @entity23 poll overall gave @entity43 a six - point lead on 36 per cent , with the @entity55 on 30 per cent and the @entity36 on 18 per cent , when asking voters to predict the next general election result			2
up and coming : the ' switchers ' would prefer @entity17 mayor @entity16 to mr @entity15 as @entity19 leader and would put home secretary @entity20 ( pictured ) in third place the ‘ switchers ’ favour @entity2 ’s immigration policies over those of the @entity55 by 62 to 34 per cent , and 51 per cent oppose same - sex marriage in line with @entity2 , compared to 39 per cent in support			1
when looking at government spending - covering health , pensioners and global aid - 64 per cent of ‘ switchers ’ favour @entity2 ’s policies , compared to just 28 per cent for the @entity55			0
the @entity55 suffered even more grim opinion poll news when @entity2 hit a record 17 per cent in the @entity77 poll for the @entity78 on sunday and @entity79 - firmly cementing its third place			0
support for the prime minister 's @entity55 fell three points to 28 per cent , with @entity43 nine points ahead after gaining one point to 37 per cent and the @entity36 also up one on 9 per cent			2
but by a majority of 38 per cent to 28 per cent , those polled said the @entity55 were more likely to win if they kept mr @entity15 as leader , following a bout of speculation of a challenge .			0

right - of - centre voters say @entity2 's @entity14 is better leader than *pm*
' switchers ' would prefer @entity16 as @entity82 , with @entity20 in third
another poll gives @entity43 37 ****%**** , @entity55 28 ****%**** , @entity2 17 ****%**** and @entity36 9 ****%****
