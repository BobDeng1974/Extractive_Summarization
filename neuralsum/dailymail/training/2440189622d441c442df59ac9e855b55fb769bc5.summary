staff at practices have been told to trawl their registers and strike - off any patients who have died or moved away			1
it followed concerns that the @entity5 was wasting millions of pounds paying @entity12 to treat ‘ ghost ’ patients who did n’t exist			2
up to 25,000 patients have been wrongly removed from gp lists in an @entity5 cost - cutting drive but figures obtained by pulse magazine show that around 4,030 genuine patients have been mistakenly removed over the last year			1
