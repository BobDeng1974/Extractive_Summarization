by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 21:26 est , 5 december 2013 @entity1 is usually a time for nice surprises – but not if you tune in to the @entity4			1
the corporation has been accused of ‘ fobbing us off ’ with old programmes after it emerged almost half of its tv schedule over the festive period will be repeats			1
during @entity1 week , viewers will be presented with nearly 300 hours of reruns on the four main channels , including vintage hits such as @entity18 , @entity19 and ’ allo ’ allo ! classic : family favourites including @entity18 are among the repeats to be shown on @entity4 over the festive period the worst offender is @entity24 , where seven out of ten programmes will be repeats – prompting accusations the corporation is failing licence fee payers by not providing enough new shows			1
last night @entity32 mp @entity31 said : ‘ the @entity4 needs to think long and hard about showing so many old programmes , because the licence fee payer will question why they are handing out £ 3.5billion for new material			1
if they continue to fob us off with the same old shows people will start asking for their money back			2
’ between saturday , december 21 , and friday , december 27 , 47 per cent of the output on the @entity4 ’s two main channels will be repeats			1
of 186 shows scheduled to air on @entity46 , 55 will be reruns – 10 per cent more than over the same period last year			0
among the tried and tested family favourites will be @entity49 , @entity50 , and old episodes of @entity52 it ! there is some good news , however – amid the glut of repeats , viewers will also be able to look forward to some new dramas			1
but because most of them have been scheduled at the same time on christmas day , it will be impossible to catch them all without using the record button			1
the biggest clash will be between the @entity4 and @entity65 on the afternoon of december 25			1
the much - hyped @entity66 special on @entity65 will be aired at the same time as @entity67 on @entity46 , followed by @entity68			1

but fans of @entity46 ’s @entity82 , which stars @entity83 , will have to wait until @entity84 for the start of series three			0
those who switch over to @entity87 in the hope of something new will be confronted by a schedule filled with reruns of @entity92 and @entity93			1
almost 60 per cent of the broadcaster ’s output will be repeats , compared with a relatively modest 28 per cent on @entity65			1
and viewers looking forward to blockbuster film premieres will instead have to make do with old favourites from the back catalogue , such as @entity101 and @entity102			2
of 56 films to be shown on @entity46 and @entity24 over the period , only seven will be network premieres			0
those hoping to recover from their festive excesses by slumping down in front of the tv in the days after @entity1 will be particularly disappointed			0
on friday december 27 , @entity24 will show nothing but repeats between 7.30am and 7.30pm			2
in total , the main broadcasters will show 52 hours of second - hand programming that day			2
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ well over 90 per cent of programmes in peak on @entity46 will be brand new , including the regeneration of @entity121 , and the eagerly anticipated return of @entity82 for example			1
‘ in daytime , there are some carefully chosen family film favourites alongside more premieres than any other channel and much loved treats from @entity130 past including @entity131			1
’ insiders said @entity24 would offer a ‘ complementary schedule ’ with ‘ classic favourites ’ shown alongside some new shows			1
@entity87 suffered a huge ratings slump this year as viewers switched off its flagship ‘ sex season ’ and accused it of dumbing down its news programmes			2
its overall share of the tv audience dropped by more than 11 per cent on last year , while rivals @entity65 and @entity146 saw their fortunes improve			0
the broadcaster ’s ratings are now on a par with @entity24 and only slightly better than @entity151 , according to figures compiled by industry magazine broadcast			0
the disappointing annual results come less than six months after regulator @entity155 wrote to @entity87 executives expressing ‘ concern ’ over falling ratings			0
viewing figures for some popular shows , such as @entity161 , have halved in recent years , and the channel ’s licence is set to expire at the end of 2014			0

chief executive @entity167 received a £ 100,000 bonus in may , taking his total salary to £ 744,000			0
over the past 12 months , the channel has had just under a 6 per cent share of all tv viewing , compared with 21 per cent for @entity46 and 17 per cent for @entity65			0
in a desperate attempt to boost audiences , @entity87 screened a season of sex - themed shows this autumn – but the flagship programme attracted fewer than 900,000 viewers			0
others have accused @entity180 of being less serious than its competitors			2
but host @entity183 defended it , saying : ‘ it should be other			0
it should be for those , perhaps , who have less of a voice anywhere else			0
’ re-runs : between saturday , december 21 , and friday , december 27 , 47 per cent of the output on the @entity4 ¿ s two main channels will be repeats			1
