with the arrival of the january transfer window comes an opportunity for managers to reassess their squads and strengthen where necessary			1
it brings the opportunity for @entity7 and @entity8 to sort out their defensive issues , for @entity10 to alleviate the pressure on @entity12 , and for @entity13 and @entity14 to trim the dead wood			1
here , @entity17 's @entity16 provides the details of the budgets and transfer targets of the @entity22 's top six clubs			1
@entity13 are not actively looking to sign any players but retain an interest in @entity25 forward @entity26 @entity27 has struggled for form and game - time at @entity13 this season and could be sold @entity31 is wanted in a loan deal by @entity33 and @entity34 after failing to make his mark at @entity13 @entity13 @entity13 's decisiveness in the summer transfer market led @entity38 to claim he had no interest in adding to his squad in january			2
and considering the @entity41 have been top of the league since the first day you ca n't blame him			0
they are , however , interested in offloading players			0
budget : £ 30m @entity49 : none ( but they like @entity26 , @entity25 ) who ’s going out : @entity31 , possibly @entity34 , loan ; @entity27 , possibly @entity54 £ 23m @entity14 are interested in former @entity13 man @entity55 , who is now at @entity57 @entity58 , 26 , joined @entity14 on a four - and - a - half - year deal , he will wear the @entity61 shirt @entity62 has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season for @entity66 @entity67 could finally about to end his nightmare spell at @entity14 @entity14 after a slow start to the season that saw the champions slip as low as sixth in the table , @entity70 's side have established some consistency and proved they can cope without star man injury - prone @entity76			2
even so , the arrival of @entity58 proves the club are not resting on their laurels			0
budget : £ 25m @entity49 : none ( but they like @entity55 , @entity57 £ 30m and @entity62 , @entity66 £ 23m ) @entity84 : @entity58 £ 28m who ’s going out : @entity67 , @entity86 £ 2m ; @entity87 , @entity88 £ 3m ; @entity89 , @entity54 , loan @entity91 , pictured in the win against @entity8 , has signed for @entity93 on loan @entity93 are also interested in bringing in @entity96 's @entity95 , who would cost around £ 4m @entity93 the predictions that @entity93 would not be able to maintain their blistering start to the season have subsided			1
after beating @entity8 at @entity102 , @entity101 's side are third in the table , though they may need to add to the squad if they want to maintain their push for a @entity107 spot			2
budget : £ 15m @entity49 : @entity95 , @entity96 , £ 4m , @entity109 , @entity110 , £ 3m @entity84 : @entity91 , loan who ’s going out : none @entity114 is being trailed by a host of clubs including @entity8 , but would cost around £ 35m @entity8 have had a long - standing interest in @entity119 defender @entity118 ( right ) @entity34 midfielder @entity120 ( right ) is another target for the @entity123 giants @entity8 have already signed former @entity125 goalkeeper @entity124 but the arrival of @entity124 means @entity127 ( left ) could be heading for the exit @entity93 full back @entity129 is a target for @entity132 as he looks to strengthen his defence @entity8 @entity132 and a host of summer signings have transformed the mood at @entity102 , but this side is undeniably a work in progress			1
@entity8 are on track for their top - four finish but have struggled for consistency and may feel the need to add to the squad to continue their upward trajectory			0
budget : £ 100m @entity49 : none ( but they like @entity118 , @entity119 £ 35m ; @entity148 , @entity149 £ 30m ; @entity114 , @entity150 , £ 35m ; @entity129 £ 15m , @entity93 ; @entity120 , @entity34 £ 40m ) @entity84 : @entity124 who ’s going out : @entity152 , possibly @entity153 , £ 1m ; @entity127 , possibly @entity154 £ 2m ; @entity155 , loan @entity7 may turn to @entity158 defender @entity157 to ease their injury problems at the back another long - term target for @entity162 is sporting @entity164 midfielder @entity163 ( left ) @entity7 have agreed a fee for young @entity167 midfielder @entity166 ( centre ) from @entity169 @entity170 ( centre ) could leave @entity7 after struggling to make appearances @entity7 @entity7 fans are experiencing familiar emotions this season			1
impressive performances have been interspersed with defensive horror - shows			0
an all - too - familiar injury crisis is in place at the club and supporters have been clamouring for @entity162 to invest in his squad			0
budget : £ 60m @entity49 : @entity157 , @entity158 £ 6m ; @entity184 , £ 6m ; @entity185 , @entity186 , £ 6m ; @entity163 , @entity187 £ 18m ; @entity188 , @entity189 £ 25m @entity84 : @entity166 , @entity169 £ 2.4m who ’s going out : @entity170 , possibly @entity191 , loan both @entity7 and @entity10 are interested in @entity189 midfielder @entity188 @entity10 could turn to @entity194 striker @entity193 in a bid to alleviate pressure on @entity12 @entity10 are listening to offers for skipper @entity198 just five months after he was given the armband another player who does n't appear to be in @entity202 's long - term plans is midfielder @entity203 @entity10 consistency has been an issue for @entity10 and some indifferent form led to questions about the manager			1
but @entity202 is slowly shaping the team in his image			0
a top - four finish is the primary objective but squad additions are needed if that 's to become a reality			0
budget : £ 30m @entity49 : none ( but they like @entity188 , @entity189 £ 25m ; @entity193 , @entity194 £ 7m ; @entity217 , @entity218 £ 18m , @entity219 , @entity220 ) who ’s going out : @entity203 , @entity222 , £ 8m ; @entity198 , possibly @entity223 , £ 5m ; @entity224 , possibly @entity225 £ 7m ; @entity226 , possibly @entity227 £ 4m , @entity228 , possibly @entity34 , £ 5m			2
