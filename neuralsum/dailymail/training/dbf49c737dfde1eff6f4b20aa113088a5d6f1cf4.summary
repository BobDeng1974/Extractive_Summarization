screaming desperately and weeping with fear , this is the harrowing moment social workers wrested an infant from his mother 's arms moments after he was born			1
almost a year on , the parents , who can not be named , are no closer to getting their baby back			1
now , the father has spoken of the moment his son was taken for the very first time			1
' they ’re just saying they ’ve got an order , they ’ve got to follow it , ' he remembers			0
' they ’ve got to follow their orders			0
you feel - there ’s nothing you can do to stop it			0
' the six - hour - old baby is cradled by its father as a police officer stands close by in the secretly recorded video social workers had obtained an order to take the child before he was even born on the grounds that the parents required too much support to take care of the baby themselves			1
that , however , cuts no ice with the distraught family			0
' you feel powerless , useless , you know worthless , ' adds the father			1
' when they started pulling my wife ’s arms , [ i knew ] that was it			0
' the case , which involved social workers from @entity48 , led to outrage when the video was first revealed last september			2
shockingly , far from engaging with the parents , the council instead attempted to gag the father and have the video removed from the internet			1
' @entity48 , their only response was to get it pulled off the internet as quick as possible , ' remembers the father			2
' it just feels like an injustice			0
they reach into your life , take everything away and they 're telling me to be quiet about it			0
' the mother is clearly distraught in the video as @entity70 social workers and police take the baby away secret forced adoptions are becoming increasingly common in the @entity75 as a new @entity77 documentary due to be screened tonight makes plain			1
in exposure : do n't take my @entity79 why they wanted to stop the father ’s webcam filming being seen and whether the method of the son ’s removal was necessary			1
they did not respond specifically to these points			0
but they did say that placing a child into care is an absolute last resort and it was the courts , and not the council , which make the final decision based on significant concern for the welfare of the child			2
but with figures showing that forced adoptions have shot up by 95 per cent over the last three years , this scenario is becoming increasingly common			1
in total , 1,860 children were adopted without their parent 's consent last year , nearly all in closed adoptions which means the parent can not contact the child in any way until the age of 18			1
destroyed : the father says he was left feeling powerless and upset by the removal of his baby son escape : some mothers have fled into the care of @entity116 ' network rather than face social workers parents whose children are subject to forced adoption orders , which are not allowed in any @entity122 country with the exception of the @entity75 , can not tell anyone what is happening to them and the media can not report on the cases - all in the name of protecting the child and its family			1
it 's a sign , says barrister and family lawyer @entity132 , that things have gone too far			0
' the purpose of the legislation that protects the confidentiality of children ’s proceedings and the identity of children ’s and their families , is to protect them , ' she explains			2
' but by a side wind , it has had the effect of also protecting poor local authority practice , poor social work , and inadequate experts , poor expert reporting to the courts			0
' as a result , more and more parents are fleeing abroad and into the arms of networks such as the one run by @entity116 , a @entity75 multimillionaire currently living in @entity156			0
' i 've got one here from a 19 - year - old girl who is pregnant and has been told by social workers that they will take her baby at birth , ' he says , pointing to one of the thousands of cases he takes on each year			2
one social worker can be heard saying : ' we are here to take [ baby j ]			2
i do n't want to have to get physical ' harrowing : the bewildered newborn baby can be heard crying during the distressing seizure ' why ? because [ social services ] say it 's at risk of emotional abuse			1
@entity174 social workers do n't believe me when i tell them children can be taken for emotional abuse , let alone for being at risk of it			1
' i get so many people but the ones that get me rattled the most are the pregnant ladies			0
what chance to they have ? ' i tell them to leave because social services ca n't stop a pregnant lady from leaving			2
they ca n't put an order on a foetus			2
they 've tried but the judges said no , they ca n't do that			0
' for the family whose child was taken so publicly by @entity48 , the nightmare continues			0
' as soon as they got the baby , they were out of the flat , ' remembers the father			1
' goodbye , leave you to it			0
all i could do was hold my wife			0
