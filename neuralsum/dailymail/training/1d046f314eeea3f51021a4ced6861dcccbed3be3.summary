football players at @entity1 can create the first union of college athletes in the @entity4 , in a ruling which could revolutionize a college sports industry worth billions of dollars			1
the case has stirred a national debate over whether student football players who help generate millions of dollars in revenue for their universities should be treated as employees			1
on wednesday , a regional director of the @entity14 decided the answer is yes			1
an employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers			2
players argued that their sports scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers			1
the decision comes at a time when the @entity46 , which organizes the athletics programs of many universities in the @entity4 , has been under increasing scrutiny over its rules and is fighting a class - action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts , memorabilia sales and video games			2
ruling : @entity57 at @entity1 which has been told it can create a union of college athletes other lawsuits allege the @entity46 failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries			0
@entity1 , which is in @entity63 , argued that college athletes , as students , do n't fit in the same category as factory workers , truck drivers and other unionized workers			0
immediately after the ruling , the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in @entity72 attorneys for the @entity19 , which would take the lead in organizing the @entity1 players , argued that college football is , for all practical purposes , a commercial enterprise that relies on players ' labor			1
supporters of the union bid also argued that the university ultimately treats football as more important than academics for scholarship players			1
@entity87 sided with the players on that issue			0
he wrote : ' the record makes clear that the employer 's scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school			2
' a ruling has decided that football players at @entity1 can create the first union of college athletes he also noted that among the evidence presented by @entity1 , ' no examples were provided of scholarship players being permitted to miss entire practices and / or games to attend their studies			1
' the ruling described how the life of a football player at @entity1 is far more regimented than that of a typical student , down to requirements about what they can and ca n't eat and whether they can live off campus or purchase a car			0
at times , players put 50 or 60 hours a week into football , he added			2
@entity123 , @entity1 's vice president for university relations , said in a statement that while the school respects ' the @entity14 process and the regional director 's opinion , we disagree with it			1
' in a written statement , the @entity46 also said it disagreed with the notion that student - athletes are employees			0
' we frequently hear from student - athletes , across all sports , that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport , not to be paid ' the @entity46 said			0
scholarship players will vote within 30 days on whether to formally authorize the @entity19 , or @entity19 , to represent them , according to former @entity140 linebacker @entity18 , the designated president of @entity1 's would - be football players ' union			1
the specific goals of @entity19 include guaranteeing coverage of sports - related medical expenses for current and former players , ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships			2
but critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could damage college sports in numerous ways , including raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players			2
the outgoing quarterback for @entity1 's @entity161 , @entity17 , took a leading role in establishing @entity19			0
the @entity164 union has been footing the legal bills			0
@entity17 , whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the @entity169 draft , said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the @entity161 roster backed the union bid , though only he expressed his support publicly			0
during the federal agency 's five days of hearings in february , @entity161 coach @entity175 took the stand for union opponents , and his testimony sometimes was at odds with @entity17 's			0
an attorney representing the university , @entity184 , noted @entity1 has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation , around 97 per cent			1
@entity184 insisted , ' @entity1 is not a football factory			0
