elegant , seemingly resilient and as much of a perfectionist as her famous boyfriend , @entity1 ’s acquaintances would say she had ‘ the legs of a gazelle and the hide of a rhino ’			2
following the shocking news of her suicide last night , we now know the latter must have been untrue			1
indeed , she hinted at her terrible vulnerability in one of her final postings on @entity17 , where she reproduced the saying : ‘ @entity19 is the armour to survive the reality of life			2
from the outside , though , it seemed the 49 - year - old former model was enjoying a halcyon period , professionally and personally			1
she had just released an eponymous perfume , on sale in the upmarket store @entity44 in @entity45			2
her cosmetics venture with make - up artist @entity47 was also hitting stores , based , she said , on the colours of the roses she grew at the home in the @entity53 she shared with @entity29			1
striking : those renowned 42 - in legs - and the little girl she once was named @entity58 her spring clothing collection had been unveiled			1
she dressed @entity60 at the @entity61 and continued to win plaudits for her fashion line			2
however , there were thousands of miles between her and @entity29 , who has been performing in @entity66 and @entity67 with the @entity68 and had moved on to @entity69 for the next leg of their tour			1
last night , various theories were presented as to why she took her life : that she was distraught following failed attempts to start a family or that she was ill. however , one source close to the @entity68 said she had harmed herself a month ago , although it was hushed up			1
fan : @entity26 and @entity80 in a @entity26 design the source added : ‘ @entity1 was really quite troubled and there were some issues over @entity29 and her standing in the family			1
it seems she suffered from depression			1
’ she was n’t , it was noted , invited to the baby shower that @entity91 hosted for @entity25 and daughter @entity92 in @entity93 at the weekend			2
she was also reportedly frustrated at being apparently consigned to the role of girlfriend rather than wife — not that she ever let on			1
@entity1 knew that , after divorcing first wife @entity97 and second wife @entity91 , @entity29 had no time for matrimony and little for monogamy			1
she seemed to be playing a long game			2
but after chalking up 12 years by his side , she could hardly be blamed for hoping for more			2
one who knew her said @entity1 was ‘ one of those people who likes perfection , ’ citing her designer glass bathroom and the impeccably furnished house she had created for @entity29 in @entity107			1
his lack of commitment was far from perfect			2
some thought she had fallen prey to the insecurities that are the lot of every rock ‘ wife ’ who waves a temporary goodbye to her man			2
the rock wives who stick at their marriages the longest tend to be the ones who go on the road with their men — such as @entity128 , who gave herself a job as @entity131 ’s road manager			2
she usually liked to be right at @entity29 ’s side			1
she was there at @entity135 when the @entity68 headlined last summer , in a chic pair of wellies , and in the wings at their last @entity140 gig			2
she also designed the stage outfits @entity29 has worn for the past two years — the snappy trilby hats , oversized coats and slinky jeans with a 28in waist			1
but for whatever reason , this time , she remained alone at their apartment in @entity45 while @entity29 , 70 , was on the road			1
the source connected with the @entity68 told the @entity151 : ‘ she just was n’t well enough to go on tour with them			2
’ @entity154 and @entity26 attend the @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 , 2011			2
@entity158 , princess @entity159 and @entity26 at the @entity160 , @entity140 , @entity93 june 2013 front row friends : @entity26 was seated next to @entity162 at the @entity164 2006 summer show in @entity107 there were other signs of strain			2
@entity1 cancelled her show at @entity169 in january at the last minute , saying her chosen fabrics had arrived too late for samples to be sewn in time			0
accounts for her business , filed in the @entity174 in october 2013 , show her company , @entity175 , had a deficit of £ 3,546,000 with the designer owing creditors £ 4,592,000			1
there was speculation last night that she was ‘ too broke ’ to stage her @entity93 show			1
however , she had just collaborated with the @entity183 store @entity182 for a collection that would have paid her around £ 3million , so perhaps this is an overstatement			0
she told an interviewer she felt the financial pressure			0
‘ every cheque , every penny , i have to be responsible for because it ’s my own money			0
’ her life story reads like an adventure novel			0
the adopted daughter of a mormon store clerk , she dreamed of the big time and made it			0
famous friends : @entity26 with actress @entity197 in @entity45 , 2002 all smiles : @entity25 was by @entity200 's side when she launched her @entity182 partnership last fall humble beginnings : @entity200 ( seen here in 2013 with musician @entity204 ) was the adoptive daughter of @entity207 parents and grew up in @entity208 @entity154 was one of her closest friends and regularly wore her designs			0
by the time she met @entity29 she had already divorced her first millionaire			1
given up for adoption at birth , she was named plain @entity58 by her adoptive parents @entity217 and @entity218 , and known as @entity1			0
she grew up in a bungalow in the tiny town of @entity221 near @entity222 , @entity208			0
her father worked in a @entity225 store			0
it was a devout household , with both parents active in the @entity207 church			0
she later said that her upbringing had been ‘ like something out of @entity231 ’			0
by the time she was 12 , she was a formidable 6ft			0
she went on to grow a further 4in			0
known at school by the nickname ‘ lady ’ , she excelled at sport and sang in the choir			0
loss : the @entity45 apartment building where @entity1 committed suicide			1
@entity158 , a medical examiner van at the apartment but she always wanted to work in fashion , and used to make dresses for her @entity248 dolls and cut up and remake vintage dresses			0
at 18 , she met the famous photographer @entity250 , who encouraged her to believe in her worth as a fashion model			0
so she applied for a passport and , knowing not a word of @entity254 , hopped on a plane to @entity107			0
in a recent interview , she said she had left after her adoptive parents declined to fund a course in fashion design			0
she said : ‘ i did n’t really feel that i was going to be able to achieve my goals in life if i ’d stayed there			0
i think i would have felt much more scared not to do it			0
‘ i wanted to be in fashion			0
i ’ve always thought if you want to do something , just do it			0
’ some thought @entity26 had fallen prey to the insecurities that are the lot of every rock ' wife ' who waves a temporary goodbye to her man she began to call herself @entity276 when she became a model , working the catwalk for eight years , and became famous for her incredible 42in legs forming the hands of a clock in a famous @entity283 advert for @entity285 tights			1
while working in @entity93 , she met @entity286 , a millionaire property developer whose mother was a member of the @entity289 jewellery family			0
they were together for three years , but in 1991 the relationship ended in a bizarre legal wrangle over a couple of valuable paintings and a full - length sheepskin coat			1
after the split from @entity297 , @entity1 moved to @entity156 and met another property developer , @entity298			0
they married , but it lasted just three years and they were divorced in 1996			0
she met @entity29 in 2001 on a shoot for a @entity254 magazine			1
he took her on holiday to @entity305 , and she was soon at his side at red carpet events			0
he had been dating @entity309 heiress @entity308 when they met but @entity1 ’s success , independence and one - liners bowled him over			1
he found her physically bewitching , too , exclaiming she had ‘ the best body i ’ve ever known ’			0
it was never about the music for @entity1			0
as she said last year : ‘ i loved @entity317 , and blues , and classical music , but never rock ’ n ’ roll			1
i get made fun of a lot			0
@entity29 used to tell me for years that this one particular song was @entity325 , and i ’d say : “ oh , i love that song , ” but it was n’t that at all ! ’ she launched her fashion line in 2005 and quickly acquired many celebrity fans — from @entity330 to @entity331 , @entity332 to @entity333			1
@entity29 would come to all her shows to support her			1
their life appeared stable — and was certainly luxurious			1
she and @entity29 lived together for several years in a @entity338 ’s hotel suite , eventually buying a house together in @entity340			1
however , due to @entity29 ’s tax arrangements , most of their life together was spent in @entity45			1
long - term : she met @entity29 in 2001 on a shoot for a @entity254 magazine ' devastated ' : @entity1 killed herself in her @entity348 apartment on monday morning after texting an assistant to ' come by ' while her longtime boyfriend @entity29 was on tour in @entity69 pricey : her off - the - rack dresses sold for between $ 1,499 and $ 2,990 designer @entity1 pictured with her family in 2000			1
from left to right , @entity26 , brother @entity354 , mom @entity218 , dad @entity217 and sister @entity355 the @entity340 house was renovated nearly ten years ago to include a nursery and nanny quarters , but no baby ever arrived			0
it was said that @entity29 went on various diets and attempted various spiritual remedies to try to assist conception , but @entity1 never had the baby she seemingly so wanted			1
her mother @entity365 observed some years ago : ‘ she usually knows what she wants and she gets it			0
’ and to the outside world it appeared as though @entity1 had everything — the model looks , a successful fashion line and a rock star boyfriend			1
yet it seems even this was n’t enough to save her from plunging into a depression that saw her take her own charmed life .			2

the designer and renowned *beauty* appeared to be enjoying success
but *beneath* she suffered from depression and had recently self - harmed
there was speculation she was insecure in relationship with @entity29
