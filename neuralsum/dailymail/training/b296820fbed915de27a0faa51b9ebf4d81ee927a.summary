@entity10 - wearing @entity9 was likened to @entity12 creature gollum by mr @entity3 after their two - wheeled war of words during the 100 - mile @entity17 event			1
the @entity19 heavyweight looked like he needed the exercise after being pictured wearing a billowing blue t - shirt while puffing his way around the course on sunday			2
clash : cyclist @entity9 admitted hurling abuse at @entity3 while he struggled up a @entity26 during the @entity17 event struggle : the @entity7 mayor was pictured cycling to the top of @entity32 this morning after joining around 20,000 riders on a 100 - mile race mr @entity3 revealed the moment he was hit by a volley of abuse while battling to the top of @entity39 in @entity26 , the highest point in @entity41			1
‘ out of the corner of my eye i saw someone imitating me – pedalling alongside and puffing with satirical glee			0
‘ he was one of those gollum - like creatures whose @entity10 appeared to be shrink - wrapped about his spindly form , ’ he wrote in his @entity47 column			0
‘ his legs were as brown and thin as @entity53 dining room chairs , and he seemed to be so totally hairless that one could imagine he applied @entity54 to every portion of his anatomy in order to minimise wind resistance			0
’ and they 're off ! @entity3 , pictured centre , started the 100 - mile iconic : the peloton cycles past the @entity62 during the @entity63 mr @entity3 claimed mr @entity9 cackled : ‘ @entity64 , @entity3 … put your back into it , you fat b * * * * * * *			1
’ the mayor said he wanted to be left along , but his tormentor continued : ‘ what ? i ’ve waited years for the chance to torture you , and i ’m not going to miss it this time ! ’ the @entity7 mayor pedalled his road bike for eight hours through the capital and the @entity78 before rewarding himself with a bacon roll at the finish on @entity81 near @entity82			1
but today his persecutor was unmasked as mr @entity9 , who claimed he was only rude to the politician because he ‘ was really in trouble and looked very sickly ’			1
nearly there : cyclists peddle past @entity82 as they near the finish line at the mall he added : ‘ @entity92 would have to freeze over before i voted for him but fair play to him he completed the ride , which was very tough			0

in @entity103 we are far too polite for that , ’ he told the @entity97			0
he went on : ‘ as for @entity105 , he is a cheeky so and so saying that , i have never heard that one before			2
‘ i am glad he finished and if he wants to get fitter he is welcome to join us in @entity103 on sunday for our club ride			0
’ the race saw cyclists ride east through @entity7 before tackling the @entity78 and looping back around into the city along a similar route to the one tackled last year during the @entity114 road races .			2
