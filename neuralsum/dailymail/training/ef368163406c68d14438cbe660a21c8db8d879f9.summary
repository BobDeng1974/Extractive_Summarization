by @entity0 @entity1 - the eccentric inventor behind the @entity3 claws , magnetic shoes , flamethrower and more - is at it again			2
this time , he ’s developed a machine to replicate the sound a fart makes , and pointed it towards @entity10 from @entity11			1
a valveless pulsejet was used to create the incredibly loud sound , which apparently was heard by two people in @entity15 - 26 miles ( 42km ) away across the @entity16			1
using a pulse jet engine he created a contraption ( shown ) that was heard in @entity10 a pulse jet engine is a type of engine in which the combustion happens in loud pulses and is fired by jets			1
they can be made with few or no moving parts and can ignite a mixture of air with the majority of fuels available			0
pulse jets are more commonly used in drones , for flying control line and radio - controlled aircraft as well as industrial drying and home heating equipment			0
the engines convert fuel into heat , making them perfect for boilers , for example			0
@entity45 has a proprietary pulse jet engine technology called @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , and plans to use pulse jet engines to lift military and commercial aircraft vertically from a standing position			1
in the video 34 - year - old @entity1 and a crowd of fans gather to watch the device in action			1
the father - of - one ignites the gas inside the jet which begins the combustion process inside the jet			0
this creates a noise that @entity1 says ‘ kind of sounds like a fart from a distance			2
’ he them calls up people in @entity15 to see if they heard the noise - which they apparently did			2
the device used in the video is a valveless pulse jet			0
a pulse jet engine is a lightweight form of jet propulsion			1
within a pipe it allows combustion to occur in pulses with little or not input from the user			0
@entity1 directed his machine to @entity15 from @entity11 - a distance of 26 miles ( shown )			1
and after calling people in @entity15 he found that the sound had been heard the device used in the video is a valveless pulse jet , seen here being used by @entity1 in a previous test			1
a pulse jet engine is a lightweight form of jet propulsion			1
within a pipe it allows combustion to occur in pulses with little or not input from the user aside from fuel @entity1 created the valveless pulse jet by making a u-shaped pipe that has fuel pumped directly in a combustion chamber			1
once the fuel is ignited the engine roars to life			0
‘ the pulse jet is a wonderful thing , its simplicity is its best strength , ’ @entity1 writes on his website			2
‘ as an engine it ’s not great as most of the energy is wasted on heat and noise but for this task it ’s that noise we need			0
’ @entity1 said his pulse jet was one of the largest that has been built			2
in a previous video he shows how he built and tested the engine for the stunt			0
this latest milestone follows some of his other crazy inventions such as @entity123 's claws from @entity125 and magnetic shoes that let the wearer walk on the ceiling .			0

34 year - old @entity1 from @entity18 has unveiled his latest creation
using a pulse jet engine he created a contraption that was heard in @entity10
he directed his machine to @entity15 from @entity11 - a distance of 26 miles
and after calling people in @entity15 he found that the sound had been heard
he used such an engine as it ' kind of sounds like a fart from a distance '
