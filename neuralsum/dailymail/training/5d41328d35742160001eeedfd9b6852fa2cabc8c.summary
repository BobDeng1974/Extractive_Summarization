as @entity3 and her dog stand on a bluff at @entity7 's @entity6 and survey endless miles of sparkling blue ocean , clear skies and shimmering sandy beaches , she ponders how life could possibly get any better in this corner of paradise			1
' really , it seems just about perfect , ' the @entity14 woman concludes			2
there 's a picturesque pier off in the distance with an old - fashioned merry - go - round that stands nearly side - by - side with the world 's first solar - powered @entity21			0
the sun is shining brightly , the temperature is a pleasant 79 degrees and a light sea breeze makes everything feel just right			0
not happy enough ? @entity28 , well - off @entity7 , @entity29 fought off 300 other cities for a million dollar grant ... and they 're using it to gauge their own happiness but there 's also loads of traffic and a high cost of living , two things that recently prompted the real estate blog @entity40 to rate @entity7 no. 2 on its top 10 list of @entity44 's @entity43			1
to do something about that , the city of 92,000 applied last year for a @entity49 grant , proposing that it create a ' @entity50 ' to determine just how much people in this picture - postcard town really like living here			1
@entity7 beat out 300 other @entity44 cities in securing $ 1 million			1
this week , officials will begin asking residents how involved they are in community activities , if they know who to turn to in times of crisis , if they know their neighbors , how healthy they are , how lonely they might be and how good an education they believe their kids are receiving			1
then they 'll examine what changes are needed to make life better			1
' it 's really about trying to get a much clearer understanding of who the people of @entity7 are , what they are doing and what we can do on a local government level to help ensure people are thriving , ' said @entity75 , assistant director of community and cultural services			1
loosen up : the breezy beach town was called one of @entity44 's most stressed out suburbs despite its laid - back reputation , so officials are trying to find out why some of the other four cities that won grants are going the more traditional route			2
@entity87 , for example , plans on building a better trash - collection system			1
@entity75 says @entity7 came up with @entity89 after the launch of its cradle to @entity92 in 2011			1
that effort , to learn how students felt about themselves , began after a tragic period that included a teenager committing suicide by throwing himself off a high - rise hotel			2
' what we found out was only a third of kindergarteners were really ready socially , emotionally , physically , cognitively , for kindergarten , ' @entity75 said			0
in a community where more than three quarters of adults have college degrees , that was a stunning discovery			0
about that same time , the city learned its efforts to promote health and fitness might have gotten out of hand when residents complained that commercial trainers had turned @entity6 into an open - air gymnasium , making it difficult to do anything else there			2
after months of debate , the city restricted who could use parks for commercial purposes			1
and on a recent weekday , there was n't a weight machine or yoga mat in sight at @entity6			0
instead , it was filled with people having picnics , jugglers , skateboarders , strollers , dog walkers , musicians and someone operating a bubble - making machine			0
some of the other four cities that won grants are going the more traditional route			0
@entity87 , for example , plans on building a better trash - collection system if @entity89 works as they hope , city officials could tweak other public services			1
@entity3 , who loads her dog into the car a couple times a month and travels to the park to unwind , could n't see too many things to improve			0
the site of numerous homeless people sprawled out in the shadow of beach - front condominiums did trouble her , however			0
@entity3 said she avoids the city 's notoriously traffic - choked freeway by taking surface streets from downtown @entity14			2
the locals cite the traffic jams , the homelessness and the cost of living as problems that make @entity7 not quite as pleasant as outsiders think			1
' we 're choking on gridlock from overdevelopment , ' says 30 - year resident @entity170 , who complained of watching the city transform from a quiet beach town of cottage - style homes and modest two - story apartments to one of high - rise condos and apartments with high mortgages and rents			2
the median price of a home is $ 992,000			0
soon , says street musician @entity182 , paradise could become the province of just the rich			0
' the way it 's going , nobody is going to be able to afford to live here anymore , ' he said as he sat in the park with his keyboard .			0

other *recipients* have used the money for *practical* purposes like improving trash collection
@entity7 officials hope to use what they learn to make they city even happier
