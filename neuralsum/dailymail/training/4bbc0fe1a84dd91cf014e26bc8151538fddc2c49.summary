@entity1 's misfiring striker @entity0 has been told by coach @entity2 to forget @entity4 's scoring exploits and concentrate on helping the team			1
while @entity4 has been scoring for fun with seven goals in his last two @entity1 matches , it has been a very different story for @entity0 who has just two from eight games so far			1
' @entity0 is fine and he has a lot of ability , ' said @entity2 ahead of his side 's @entity15 game at @entity17 on saturday			1
@entity0 must score goals on a regular basis if he wants to remain in @entity1 's starting line - up the @entity21 has been told by his manager to not compare his goalscoring record to @entity4 's @entity4 has been on fire for @entity1 - scoring 10 goals in his last five games for his club @entity0 , pictured in training , has scored two goals in eight games for @entity1 so far this season ' he needs to work as he always has done and not feel any pressure about scoring			1
there is no need for him to worry that @entity4 has scored four goals			2
the only thing that he needs to think about is helping the team to play better and give solutions in attack			0
' @entity0 failed to score in the 8 - 2 destruction of @entity41 last weekend when @entity4 hit a hat - trick			1
he was then rested for the midweek clash against @entity44 , as the @entity45 got four in a 5 - 1 victory			0
@entity2 showed his confidence in @entity0 ahead of the season by not recruiting multiple striking reinforcements , which left the @entity21 as the only recognised centre forward at the club			1
yet his poor goal record has caused alarm bells to ring at the @entity55			0
@entity57 's early form for @entity1 will put pressure on the former @entity60 forward @entity2 restructured his team against @entity44 by putting @entity4 and @entity62 together in the centre of the attack and they swept aside the visitors			1
@entity4 showed he is back to his best after knee and hamstring injuries that had taken the edge off his game in recent months			2
' i have faced @entity4 when i was at @entity73 and he was at ( @entity75 ) @entity74 and i do n't think it is easy to stop him			2
if you are up against him then it is better not to think about it so that you are calmer , ' joked @entity2			2
' at the moment there is no doubt that he is the best in the world and it is not easy to mark the best in the world			0
we are lucky that we have him in our team and that he has plenty of desire and character			0
' he is a leader and it is necessary to have him fine physically and mentally as he will win you titles			0
' @entity2 has warned his players they must shore up their defence if they are to win the title @entity2 will be hoping for an improvement in defence against @entity17 , which has been @entity1 's weak point in the opening five @entity15 games			1
they are in fifth place in the table , four points off the lead			0
' the teams with the best chance of winning trophies are those that are solid and concede few goals , ' he said			0
' last year we were successful because we became more solid and we know that our team will never have problems to score			0

@entity21 *international* @entity0 has scored just one @entity15 goal so far this season
@entity4 , on the other hand , has *netted* nine times in the league
@entity2 has labelled *ronaldo* the best player in the world
