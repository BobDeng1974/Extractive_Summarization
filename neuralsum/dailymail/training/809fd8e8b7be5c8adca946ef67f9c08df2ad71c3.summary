the argument occurred as the pilot cruised down wrong taxiway at the @entity4 airport the pilot took offense at what he called the controller 's ' bad attitude ' over the mistake by @entity10 shocking audio of a heated exchange between a @entity14 pilot and an air traffic controller has flyers wondering just who 's in charge of keeping them safe during air travel			1
all the more disturbing is the time when moment the argument occurred : just as the pilot was landing the jet at the @entity4 airport on the wrong taxiway			1
' like , oh my @entity26 , there 's another plane out there like six miles away , ' mocks the pilot			1
' @entity14 , you 're supposed to be on @entity42 , ' the unnamed , coolheaded air traffic controller says in audio posted to liveatc.net			2
' yes sir , ' the pilot responds			2
' we 're going out there now			0
' the aitr traffic controller responds : ' it looks like you joined @entity55 , ' in reference to the taxiway on which the pilot had actually landed			1
that 's when the pilot gets nasty			1
' you know what , ' he snaps , ' we 'll taxi out there any way we want when you tell us to			0
i do n't like your attitude			0
' still , the @entity4 controller , charged with keeping hundreds of thousands of passengers per day safe at @entity72 's busiest airport , stayed cool			1
' good morning , there was no attitude			0
i was just trying to correct you			0
that 's my job to correct you if you mess up , ' he said			0
the pilot again accuses the air traffic controller of being the one neglecting his duties before another pilot on the same frequency chimes from another plane to sum the confrontation perfectly			2
' settle down , captain happy , ' he quips .			0
