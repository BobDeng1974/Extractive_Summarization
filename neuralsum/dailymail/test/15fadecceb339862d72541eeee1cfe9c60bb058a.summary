the 22 - year - old @entity22 goalkeeper is bidding to be the first @entity1 captain to lift the @entity25 under 21 championship since @entity27 's team won the trophy in 1984 and @entity2 is expected to be a big part of their team as they attempt to end 31 years of hurt			1

he 's come out of nowhere and shown what he 's about			2
' he has constantly been 100 per cent driven and his finishing is among the best i 've seen even though he is young			0
' for me , there 's not a player of the same age near him			1
