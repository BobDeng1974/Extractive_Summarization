@entity1 is behaving like @entity2 by ' stoking division in @entity4 ' , a senior @entity0 warns			1
in a provocative intervention , @entity5 last night accused @entity8 's first minister of trying to break up @entity9 using the same tactics as the @entity12 president in the early days of the @entity14 crisis			1
miss @entity1 will use her keynote speech at the @entity17 's conference in @entity18 today to insist that she will ' demand an end to slash and burn austerity ' in return for propping up @entity22 in @entity23			1
a senior @entity0 has said @entity8 's first minister @entity1 ( right ) is behaving like @entity12 's @entity2 ( left ) by ' stoking division in @entity4 ' she will claim to be sending a ' message of friendship and solidarity ' to @entity4 voters who want an end to spending cuts that ' tear at the very fabric of society '			1
but mr @entity5 , a serving government whip who was once a member of the @entity35 , last night accused her of masterminding a plot designed to anger @entity4 voters and hasten the break - up of the @entity9			1
' @entity1 is intent on stoking division in @entity4 in the same way @entity2 used it to break apart @entity14 , ' he said			1
' i 'm talking about the early days in the @entity14 crisis , before the tanks , when he spread division and fear in order for it to splinter apart			0
' separatists all over the world use division and nationalism to break up countries			2
@entity1 may dress it up as friendliness , but that is what she wants – she wants @entity4 to tell the @entity8 to get lost			1
' @entity57 could stop this if @entity22 said he would not proceed with legislation ... that could not get through without @entity17 votes			2
but if @entity57 's greed for power allows her to succeed , then @entity62 help the @entity9			1
' miss @entity1 has previously provoked anger by saying she would ' lock the @entity67 out ' of @entity23 in the event of a hung parliament – even if they win the most seats			0
miss @entity1 has said she has no qualms about installing mr @entity22 ( pictured ) in @entity72 she said she would have no qualms about installing mr @entity22 in @entity72 , despite believing that @entity8 should not even be part of the @entity9			1
but she warned she would push for ' an end to austerity and the non-renewal of @entity78 ' in return			0
treasury figures show the @entity17 's plans would involve an extra £ 148billion of spending – leading to higher borrowing and taxes			0
however polls predict the party could win more than 50 of @entity8 's 59 seats at the election – and could potentially prop up a minority @entity57 government			1
miss @entity1 will claim today that her party 's left - wing stance appeals to millions of voters in @entity4			2
she will tell activists : ' to ordinary people across these islands who feel just as let down by the out of touch westminster system as we do , i have a very clear message			0
' it is a message of friendship and solidarity			0
as long as @entity8 remains part of the @entity108 system , we will be your allies in seeking to reform that outdated system			0
' so to people in @entity4 , @entity112 and @entity113 , i make this promise			0
the @entity17 stands ready to work with you			0
we will demand an alternative to slash and burn austerity			1
' former @entity0 defence minister sir @entity117 accused @entity118 of ' arrogance ' for boasting that she could hand power to labour even if it loses the election			2
he said : ' we have had the @entity8 referendum , which she lost , and now she wants to dictate policy to @entity4 – what arrogance			2
the @entity17 has demonstrated that it is deeply socialist – far worse even than @entity57			0
' he said it would be ' catastrophic ' for the @entity9 if the @entity17 held the balance of power , as it would lead to ' more spending and borrowing , higher taxes and weaker defences '			0
fellow @entity0 @entity134 said @entity57 appeared to have been ' taken hostage ' by the @entity17			2
' it is quite clear that @entity137 will ride roughshod over @entity22 and hold him to ransom for a very high price			0
