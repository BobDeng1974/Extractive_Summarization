on the town : @entity2 students enjoying a carnage event with a @entity5 theme police will today issue an unprecedented plea for moderation in drinking as they admit defeat in tackling @entity13 ’s excessive boozing culture			1
the country ’s most senior officer responsible for fighting alcohol - related crime called for an end to the attitude which tolerates out - of - control drunkenness as ‘ normal ’			2
chief constable @entity20 also admitted officers ’ efforts to combat booze - fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘ barely scratched the surface ’ of a problem that is ‘ blighting our communities ’			1
last year , mr @entity20 called for the installation of drunk tanks on the streets to mop up some of the mess caused by the @entity13 ’s failed 24 - hour drinking experiment			1
today , he will say that despite officers ’ best efforts there had been ‘ few changes ’ in 12 months			1
in a 24 - hour period measured by mr @entity20 ’s own force , @entity40 , more than one in four incidents reported to police were related to alcohol			1
he will also call for much tougher action against the alcohol industry , a clampdown on cheap booze and more action to combat criminals with alcohol problems			0
and he will say : ‘ but there is only so much progress we can make without individuals taking personal responsibility for their drinking			0
‘ @entity58 tolerance for excessive drinking is far too great and it is considered normal to be so drunk that people are not in control of themselves			2
‘ this puts an enormous burden on police and health services and affects the service we offer to the public			2
’ this weekend will see a campaign of action against public drunkenness across the country			1
it could mean drunks being refused entry to pubs and clubs if they fail a compulsory breathalyser test			2
a breathalyser scheme – which is in operation at student venues in @entity82 – will see anyone considered too drunk when they arrive at a venue turned away on the basis of their alcohol reading			1
it is designed to tackle ‘ pre-loading ’ , people drinking substantial quantities of cheap supermarket booze before going out on the town			0
elsewhere , officers will issue ‘ yellow card ’ style warnings to people who are drunk , who will then be forced to leave the town or city centre if they do not control their behaviour			0
officers will also visit schools and university campuses to give alcohol awareness lessons to both school age pupils and students who are beginning freshers ’ week			0
police have admitted efforts to combat booze - fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘ barely scratched the surface ’ of a problem that is ‘ blighting our communities ’ the police action was backed by academics who called for officers to set up ‘ booze borders ’ around city centres , refusing entry to anyone who is very drunk – or making them sober up			1
@entity124 , of think - tank demos , said : ‘ we need a tougher and smarter approach in those specific places that have big issues with problem drinking and where our current strategies are n’t working			0
‘ this includes giving drunk and disorderly people entering city centres a “ yellow card ” and denying them entry – or forcing them to sober up for an hour in a drunk tank			0
’ twenty - four - hour drinking , brought in by @entity141 under @entity142 , was opposed by the @entity143 with support from senior police , ambulance staff and judges			0
supporters claimed the move would bring a peaceful , continental - style drinking culture to the @entity13			2
but police have said round - the - clock opening had caused ‘ significant problems ’ , and anyone put in a tank should be charged up to £ 400 a night , including a £ 100 on - the - spot fine .			0
