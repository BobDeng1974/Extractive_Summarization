by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 26 february 2013 with news of @entity3 becoming a father at 67 and @entity5 at 52 , it seems that you 're never too old to have children			0
but the ideal age to start to procreate , according to a recent study of @entity11 mothers and fathers , is just 26 - years - old			1
a third of parents claim that having children at a younger age meant they could have a bigger family , while a fifth felt they will have more in common with their children			1
are they ready ? @entity20 and @entity21 are both 26 , the perfect age for having a first child a quarter of those questioned were n’t sure how long it would take to conceive , and so wanted to start early			1
owning a house and getting married were the two key milestones most parents wanted to have reached before having children			1
despite these milestones , six in 10 parents were happy to be earning a collective wage of just £ 25,000 a year before settling down to have a family			1
collective wage : six in 10 parents were happy to be earning a collective wage of just £ 25,000 a year before settling down to have a family , @entity36 and @entity37 are both 26 but earn a lot more than that @entity43 , clinical psychologist and contributor to the @entity47 whitepaper , who carried out the research , said : ' the results of this survey are quite surprising , as we would have expected parents to think the perfect age to start a family to be late twenties to early thirties , as opposed to mid-twenties			1
' contrary to popular belief younger women are planning a family after just a few years of working rather than waiting to establish a career , going travelling or spending time on hobbies			2
' perhaps there is a realisation that as the recession affects work prospects , planning for a family can come first and career later			0
' perfect age : like @entity72 , most brits think that 26 is the perfect age to have a child			1
reasons include worrying that they wo n't be able to conceive when older the report also questioned 2000 childless adults about their plans to have a family			2
while one in 20 claimed they never wanted to have children , the average age across the rest of the respondents was 28			0
so despite two thirds of people without children wanting to have achieved something in life before starting a family , most reckon they will have done this before hitting 30			0
as well as wanting to have a house and marriage sorted , half of those polled wanted to earn a decent amount of money , while 47 per cent want job security			0
four in 10 people would like to have savings in the bank before settling down with kids and 26 per cent wanted to have enjoyed lots of holidays			2
older fathers : the average age for wanting children across childless respondents was 28 , much younger than celebrity fathers @entity3 who had a baby at 67 and @entity5 , 52 childless couples also wanted to make a number of preparations before starting a family , but financial stability outweighs pre-conceptual health planning – six in 10 wanted to save money for months in advance , while only a fifth would take folic acid , vitamins and supplements			1
despite government recommendations , 85 per cent of mothers and pregnant women did n’t take a conception supplement containing folic acid , omega - 3 and vitamin d during their pregnancy			0
adopting a healthier attitude to life was a big concern – just under half of those polled on pregnancy wanted to eat healthier food , a quarter would take up more exercise and the same percentage would like to lose weight			0
of those mothers who have already had children , a fifth admitted they were initially worried that they were n’t healthy enough to start a family			2
and of the six in 10 mums who planned their conception , one in 10 stopped smoking , and 23 per cent made healthier food choices and cut down on alcohol .			0

both mothers and fathers have *voted* mid-twenties as time when young couples should start a family
owning a house and getting married were key milestones to achieve before having a family
