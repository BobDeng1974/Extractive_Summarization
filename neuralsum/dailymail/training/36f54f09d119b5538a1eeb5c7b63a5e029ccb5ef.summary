a @entity4 exploration rover trawling @entity5 for signs of life has left behind an interesting sign of its own			1
the hilarious image was spotted on @entity4 's website , where mischievous engineers had even placed it on one of the mission 's homepages			1
resemblance : the tyre tracks left by @entity4 's rove spirit in 2004 bear an uncanny resemblance to male genitalia it shows tracks left on the red planet by @entity17 , one of @entity4 's twin rovers , as they wheeled across its surface in 2004			1
the picture was shared on @entity28 with the caption : ' @entity30 = $ 800m , @entity31 to operate = $ 1bn			0
drawing a penis on the surface of another planet = priceless			0
' the image proved so popular that @entity4 's servers were initially unable to cope with demand			1
however , it appeared they soon got the joke , uploading a higher resolution version - although no official comment on the picture has been made			0
although the rover 's on @entity5 are able to drive themselves around , engineers of earth control their movements via ' satnav ' maps which are periodically uploaded to the rovers			2
the rovers , along with the more recent arrival @entity53 , often turn in tight circles or perform unusual movements as engineers test their systems or change direction			1
it it believed the image became popular as a joke among engineers which has now been uncovered , as the image appears on an official page at @entity4 's @entity68			1
you 've drawn what ? reddit users say @entity4 updated its site ( seen right ) soon after the image was spotted to show a higher quality version ( left ) the image forms part of a large panorama captured by the @entity78 nearly a year ago is called @entity17 's " @entity80 " panorama			1
it combines many frames acquired during @entity17 's 59th through 61st martian days , or sols ( march 3 to 5 , 2004 ) from a position about halfway between the landing site and the rim of " @entity88			2
" the location is within the transition from the relatively smooth plains to the more rocky and rugged blanket of material ejected from @entity88 by the force of the impact that dug the crater			0

the camera took images though 5 different filter at each pointing			0
this mosaic is an approximately true - color rendering generated using the images acquired through filters centered at wavelengths of 750 , 530 , and 480 nanometers			0
the six - wheeled , solar - powered robots were launched on @entity5 almost a decade ago to scour the surface of the planet and beam information back to @entity4 teams on @entity121			2
the spirit rover became stuck at the end of 2009 , and its last communication with @entity121 was in 2010			1
opportunity continues to traverse the planet			0
opportunity : the six - wheeled robotic rovers were launched almost a decade ago to investigate the surface of @entity5 robotic : opportunity , left , is still traversing the planet 's surface , while @entity17 , seen right in a @entity4 image , ran into difficulty on @entity5 in 2009			2

reddit users spotted *unfortunate* pattern in picture posted on @entity4 website

*programmed* to spin in tight circles to test *terrain* and find new routes
