' @entity1 advantage ' : prince @entity2 is facing fresh scrutiny over his finances - with mps claiming his tax payments are not transparent prince @entity2 is facing fresh scrutiny over his finances , as mps claimed his tax payments are not transparent and the way he is funded may offer an ‘ unfair advantage ’			1
a powerful committee said the @entity11 , the private estate of lucrative land and property holdings which paid the prince a record income of £ 19milion last year , does not pay businesses taxes			1
and while they praised the heir to the throne for voluntarily agreeing to pay income tax , he was accused of disguising the exact rate he pays by lumping it together with his vat			0
@entity25 , chair of the @entity26 , said a number of steps needed to be taken to bring the @entity29 ‘ more in line with the expectations of the present day			1
’ the @entity29 , worth £ 847million , is not liable for corporation tax or capital gains tax			1
mrs @entity25 said : ‘ the duchy enjoys an exemption from paying tax even though it engages in a range of commercial activities			0
this tax exemption my give it an unfair advantage over its competitors who do pay corporation tax and capital gains tax			1
‘ the @entity43 should examine whether the @entity29 ’s tax exemption creates an unlevel playing field			0
’ @entity46 denied this was the case			0
a spokesman said : ‘ as we explained in the @entity51 hearing , we do not believe we have a competitive advantage			0
the @entity54 ’s income is taxed at income tax rates			0
‘ the duchy is not subject to corporation tax and the @entity29 is not a corporation			0
the duchy is exempt from any tax on capital gains , any capital gains have to be reinvested in the business and can not be distributed			0
’ mps claimed in their report on the @entity11 published today that it was ‘ not transparent precisely how much and what rate of income tax is paid by the @entity68 '			1
extensive : the @entity29 of @entity54 comprises more than 50,000 acres of land in 24 countries , including the @entity72 cricket ground in @entity73 , pictured above he paid £ 4.4million in tax last year – and they acknowledged the ‘ vast majority ’ of it was income tax			1
but earlier this year the committee accused the prince of paying a lower tax rate – at 23.6pc – than his domestic servants			1
in this report they call for the two payments to be disclosed separately , and also accused the @entity43 of failing to scrutinise the @entity29 ’s finances rather than relying only on reports from estate officials			1
but mrs @entity25 said the @entity11 - which comprises more than 50,000 acres in land in 24 countries including the @entity72 cricket ground in @entity73 as well as lucrative investments - had ‘ performed well ’ in 2012 - 13			2
action : @entity25 , chair of the @entity26 , said steps needed to be taken to bring the @entity29 ' more in line with the expectations of the present day ' it increased its total income to £ 28.8million and produced an overall surplus of £ 19.1million			1
last night one of the country ’s leading tax experts , who did not wish to be named , blasted the committee ’s report saying they were mistaken in suggesting the @entity11 should pay businesses taxes and accused the committee of ‘ ill - informed financial showboating ’			1
‘ it disappoints me that they have perpetuated this error in suggesting that the @entity29 ought to pay a corporation tax ’ , the expert said			0
‘ it is not a corporation			0
it is a private estate , a private dukedom on which the beneficiary pays income tax			2
in actual fact the @entity68 does n’t have to even do that but does so voluntarily			2
’ he said the one area where he agreed with the committee was on the amount of tax the prince was allowed to write off as expenses – which was £ 10.9million , or more than half his income			1
‘ i do n’t think many private clients would be given such a generous expense allowance			0
and i also agree with them in their argument about separating the prince ’s vat and income tax			2
they are very different things and there is no logical reason for lumping them together ’ , he said			0
in a july session of the committee , @entity138 mp @entity137 claimed the prince was paying a lower tax rate than his servants			2
he claimed @entity2 ’ payment of 23.6pc of his income in direct and indirect taxes compared with 38 per cent paid by the poorest quarter of the population .			2

prince @entity2 *'s* tax payments are not transparent , claim mps
@entity26 says the way he is funded may offer an ' unfair advantage '
