@entity0 emerged from a thorough drenching at @entity2 and a fourth straight defeat sounding every bit like a man who is starting to lose patience with his players			1
after outplaying @entity9 at home on monday night and losing , @entity8 were the better team again here			1
but @entity13 ’s brilliant penalty save from @entity14 proved to be the turning point and @entity16 snatched the winner 17 minutes from time to lift @entity19 clear of the relegation zone			1
worse still for @entity0 , the goal came from a @entity8 throw - in close to their own penalty box and at a point in the game when they were dominant			1
@entity16 bundled the ball home from close range to give @entity19 a valuable win against @entity8 @entity16 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring the all - important goal to give his side a valuable three points on saturday @entity14 steps up from the penalty spot as @entity8 have a golden opportunity to go ahead in the second half @entity14 shows his frustration after missing a penalty for his side - which turned out to be crucial as his side fell to a late defeat @entity0 looks on frustrated from the bench after seeing his side concede late on against @entity19 @entity42 fires an attempt in on goal for @entity19 as the hosts look to make the breakthrough in the first half @entity19 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity13 8 ; @entity48 7 , @entity49 7 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 74 , 6.5 ) ; @entity53 6 , @entity54 5.5 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 ; @entity16 7 , @entity42 7			1

however , when he tried to play the ball down the line , it was charged down by @entity42			0
the ball ran loose for @entity16 , whose shot looked unlikely to trouble @entity65 until it took a deflection off @entity68 and rolled inside the @entity104 goalkeeper ’s near post			1
‘ of course i ’m very disappointed , ’ said a dejected @entity0			2
‘ it ’s been the same story in the last few games			2
you can make football very difficult but i do n’t like to do that because it ’s simple			0
this is n’t the first time			0
‘ it ’s about scoring from chances and more mistakes in defence			0
that ’s why we had a row of winning games and why we did n’t win today or against @entity9			2
maybe it ’s confidence now after four defeats			0
@entity124 makes his way onto the pitch ahead of @entity19 's match with @entity8 on saturday @entity19 players confront @entity129 after taking exception after a strong challenge from @entity132 on @entity13 @entity129 checks to see if @entity13 is alright after a heavy collision during the first half at @entity2 @entity19 defender @entity49 puts in a strong challenge on @entity8 midfielder @entity132 @entity132 lies down in agony after feeling the full brunt of the challenge from @entity49 ‘ from the start of the second half to missing the penalty we played great football			1
we had total domination and i was waiting for the goal			2
' we had chances to kill the game but then one mistake — i call it a mistake because our throw - in ends in a goal for @entity19 — and that ’s disappointing			1
’ this win made it 12 points from six games for @entity19 , who looked doomed to relegation when they were still waiting for their first win a month ago			1
in a contest of two very contrasting styles , @entity124 ’s team had the better of the first half but were on the back foot in torrential rain after half - time and should have gone behind when @entity8 won their penalty			1
there was little doubt about the decision from referee @entity83 : @entity69 sold @entity56 a dummy and the @entity19 forward took the defender down with his outstretched right foot			2
@entity14 scored 11 penalties in two seasons at @entity177 before joining @entity8 in the summer and this one seemed good enough , steered low inside the post with his left foot			2
but @entity13 anticipated brilliantly and lunged full - length to turn it away with both hands			0
‘ in my opinion it was not a good penalty , ’ said the @entity182			0
‘ @entity14 is a specialist			0
it was good goalkeeping but ( the shot ) was not very hard			0
it ’s a bad penalty			0
’ @entity191 is pictured ahead of @entity19 's match with @entity8 on saturday @entity14 looks to hold off @entity19 defender @entity193 during a first - half attack from @entity8 @entity0 looks on with interest during the first half of his side 's match against @entity19 on saturday @entity8 went agonisingly close to equalising in the closing stages but @entity66 fired inches wide of the post and an unmarked @entity70 somehow headed over in added time			1
‘ you need a scratch of luck and we got that with the goal , ’ said @entity124			0
‘ the same ca n’t be said for the penalty save because it was outstanding			0
they ’re the margins and we ’ve been on the wrong side of them at times			0
‘ @entity8 have brought in quality and £ 60million speaks for itself			2
we had to work very hard to get a result and we ’ve done that			0
the @entity8 boss reacts sarcastically to a decision against his side as he looks on with a smile on his face @entity16 looks to get ahead of @entity8 right back @entity66 as the hosts searched for a late winner at @entity2 @entity13 is congratulated by @entity224 the @entity19 mascot after his side recorded an impressive 1 - 0 win against @entity8 @entity14 is angry with himself at the full - time whistle after he squandered the opportunity to give his side the lead before they fell to defeat			1

@entity16 ' goal enough to give hosts welcome three points against out - of - form @entity8
as a result the @entity19 move out of the relegation zone and up to 17th in the @entity238
@entity0 's side have now lost four *successive* @entity238 games
