pupils at @entity10 's @entity9 in @entity11 told staff they spotted a man with a gun by school head teacher @entity29 said : ' i am disappointed the school was not informed that this exercise was happening			1

' i will be speaking to the police further about the incident and how they are planning on closing the case			1
' mr @entity29 said no police , military vehicles or personnel were spotted near the school , which caters for 199 pupils , but two brothers said their friends who spotted the gunman were ' really scared '			1

how can they be secret when even a kid can see them with a gun			1

' they were just playing by there he said he saw this guy walking along carrying a gun , so they started to follow him			2
' they saw him put it in his pocket and then he said he " went to tell a grown up "			0
' a first i thought " oh was it really a gun " , or could it have been a lighter or something like that			2
but when he told me how the school acted i thought it must have been serious			2
' it 's very scary , only recently a gunshot was fired through a couple 's house near to the school so i really do think this is the least sensitive place they could have held this exercise			1
head teacher @entity29 said he is ' disappointed ' with police for not informing them beforehand ' why did they do it there and why did they do at lunchtime ? ' i have a lot of respect for the police and i know they have a hard job to do especially after what happened in @entity116 , but i just can not understand why they did it			2
' the boys were quite scared by it			2
i mean they 're boys and they found it exciting but it 's very scary at the same time			2
i think the school dealt with it really well though			0
' parent and former teacher @entity126 , 38 , said : ' i ca n't believe the school were n't told about it			2
' the man was right by the gate where a lot of the girls build dens so they would have been really close to him			2
' why was it held it the lunch hour and why just outside a school ? i ca n't understand it			0
' another parent , who asked not to be named , said : ' my son said the man had a handgun and was at the school fence and he is not prone to making things up			2
' i think the school did the right thing			0
the teachers were brilliant as usual			0

while staff did not specifically mention ' terrorists ' , parents criticised the timing of the event , and said children would have seen the @entity116 tragedy on tv			1
headteacher @entity246 said the school has been holding drills for its ' lockdown / sheltering procedure ' for ' a number of years ' alongside fire evacuations			0
she said : ' emergency evacuation and sheltering is practised regularly			0
using both drills enable us to prepare children for an unplanned situation			0
' it makes sure they are aware of what is expected of them and also minimise any panic , which can occur in an emergency situation , such as an external gas leak			0
