by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 01:28 est , 15 july 2013 @entity2 mp @entity1 said the country 's attitude to pensioners is ' uncivilised ' neighbourhood watch groups should help ‘ lonely and miserable ’ pensioners , according to a health minister			1
@entity1 argues that more than a million pensioners could be cared for by the anti-crime groups			1
he also described the country ’s attitude to the elderly as ‘ uncivilised ’ and urged the public to acknowledge that pensioners living nearby need their help			2
mr @entity1 wants to see the existing groups apply for ‘ care status ’ and play a role helping to wash and feed the elderly as well as providing companionship			1
the plans , which have the approval of senior government figures and have been welcomed by neighbourhood watch leaders , would help to reduce the number of pensioners forced into care homes , the @entity2 minister hopes			1
in an interview with the @entity30 , he said : ‘ the truth is that many people in this day and age live miserable lives			0
‘ if someone lives on their own and has substantial care needs , and the extent of their life is getting out of bed , getting washed , sitting in a chair and going back to bed , with no one to see during the day , that is a miserable life			2
‘ we have a national movement that looks out for whether our houses are being burgled , so should we not be thinking – all of us stepping up to the plate – about whether there are people on our streets who have care needs , or who might just be very lonely and could do with a bit of companionship ? ’ mr @entity1 warned that care services were being put under increasing strain because of the growing elderly population			1
but he denied the plans meant the ‘ state abdicating its responsibility ’ and said the measures would be about ‘ recognising there needs to be a collaboration ’ between communities and authorities			0
he also fended off criticism that he was devaluing the role of skilled and trained carers , admitting that his plans could not be a replacement for traditional care			2
@entity73 , the chairman of the @entity74 and @entity75 , said : ‘ we would encourage this			0
it is important for groups of members to be aware of the vulnerable people in their communities			2
’ mr @entity1 fended off criticism that he was devaluing the role of skilled carers by saying neighbourhood watch groups could care for the elderly the move also won support from old age experts saga with a note of caution over some of the more personal elements of care			1
spokesman @entity93 said : ‘ anything that goes to show that @entity95 is a caring society and one which promotes good neighbourliness can only be a good thing and neighbourhood watch is a good place to start			0
‘ but when it comes to providing more intimate , personal care there is probably a greater element of screening and training that may be necessary			0
’ about 3.8million older people live alone , including 60 per cent of women aged 75 and over			0
there are 173,000 neighbourhood watch groups in @entity112 and @entity113 .			0

@entity1 said more than a million pensioners could be cared for by anti-crime groups
warned care services are being put under strain because of ageing population
