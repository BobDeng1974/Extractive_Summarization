queen @entity2 's relationship with her devoted ghillie @entity0 150 years ago set tongues wagging from the grand hallways of @entity5 to the servants ’ quarters at @entity8			1
but while rumours that the pair were lovers endure to this day , a top historian has now claimed that they never had sex			1
the monarch 's biographer , @entity14 , believes that the couple ' hugged one another and slept together ' but that the relationship was never consummated			1
man and wife : queen @entity2 and her servant @entity0 , pictured together , were married but never consummated their relationship , her biographer , @entity14 , claimed in a new @entity26 programme he said : ' i do n't believe @entity2 @entity2 had full sexual relations with @entity0			1
i do believe they had a little marriage ceremony at @entity31 , which the minister confessed to on his deathbed			0
' the historian made the statement in the first installment of @entity2 @entity2 's letters : a @entity38 , a two - part series he is presenting on @entity41			1
@entity0 , who was seven years @entity2 's junior , is best remembered today thanks to the acclaimed 1997 film @entity42 , starring @entity44 and @entity45			1
the strapping 6ft ghillie was brought south from his post at @entity8 to become @entity2 's personal groom at @entity49 - her house on the @entity51 - following her husband 's death			1
on film : the couple portrayed by @entity44 and @entity45 in acclaimed 1997 movie @entity42 her courtiers were pleased at first that @entity0 was able to coax her out of her misery but they soon became concerned that she had fallen utterly under his spell			0
@entity0 immediately adopted a bullying and familiar manner with her that astonished courtiers and caused the @entity2 ’s daughters to refer to him as ‘ @entity68 ’s lover ’			1
he became increasingly high - handed , and soon the rest of the royal household came to loathe him			0
other servants snidely dubbed @entity0 ‘ the @entity2 ’s stallion '			2
@entity0 encouraged her to drink whisky with him			0
@entity76 ’s @entity75 was their preferred tipple			0
she was soon referring to the hirsute @entity78 as ‘ fascinating @entity79 ’			0
a shocked foreign secretary , the @entity81 , recorded that they slept in adjoining rooms ‘ contrary to etiquette and even decency ’			0
the first @entity87 propaganda , claiming that he was the @entity2 ’s ‘ morganatic husband ’ ( married but with the stipulation that he would have no claim on any title ) , appeared in pamphlets circulated by the @entity94 socialist republican nationalist @entity93			0
@entity2 began to address @entity0 as ‘ @entity95 ’ in her letters to him , and it was some claimed that during a trip to @entity99 , ‘ @entity100 ’ — the old @entity94 word for sexual intercourse — had taken place			2
there are those who believe that the pair went on to have a child together , but suggestions that a child was born nine months later in @entity110 are untenable			0
@entity111 , the sculptor , who spent several months at @entity8 sculpting a head of @entity0 for @entity2 and observed them both at close quarters , later told @entity115 ( one of @entity117 ’s mistresses ) that @entity2 allowed @entity0 ‘ every conjugal privilege ’			2
further evidence may have existed in the affectionate memoir @entity2 wrote about @entity0 after his death in 1883			2
but her senior courtiers refused to let her publish it , fearing that it would further damage her reputation , and had it destroyed , together with @entity0 ’s own diaries			0
but there are those who disagree with the claim that the pair shared a romantic relationship			0
intimate : @entity2 began to addressed @entity0 , above , as ‘ @entity95 ’ in her letters , and it was some claimed that during a trip to @entity99 , ‘ @entity100 ’ — the old @entity94 word for sexual intercourse — had taken place close : the strapping ghillie was brought south from @entity8 to become @entity2 's personal groom at @entity49 , her house on the @entity51 , following her husband 's death			1
above , a painting of the pair @entity146 author @entity145 claimed in her book that the reason @entity2 kept her strapping servant so close was because he ' channelled the spirit ' of her late husband			2
she argued that the @entity2 ’s senior courtiers went to great lengths to keep the seances she held with @entity0 secret , fearing news of them would lead to rumours that the @entity2 had lost her @entity159 faith , or even her sanity			2
another biographer of @entity2 , the @entity162 , concluded that @entity2 and @entity0 had a platonic relationship .			1

rumours that the monarch and her servant were lovers endure to today
but her biographer claims that they never consummated their relationship
@entity14 said the couple shared a bed but simply ' hugged on another '
