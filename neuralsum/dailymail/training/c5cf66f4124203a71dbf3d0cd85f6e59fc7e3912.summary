@entity0 has been accused of trying to ‘ airbrush out ’ his party ’s shameful record on the @entity3 in @entity4 after it removed all references to the health service in leaflets sent out there			1
the @entity10 leader has claimed he will make the general election a fight about the future of the @entity3 but the party , which has been embarrassed by the poor - state of the @entity10 - run @entity3 in @entity4 , has left off any mention of health in campaign literature posted to homes there			1
it comes as a poll shows @entity10 voters have higher levels of satisfaction with the @entity3 than other parties , despite mr @entity0 's dire warnings that it is in peril			1
labour leader @entity0 has claimed he will make the general election a fight about the future of the @entity3 but the party has left off any mention of health in campaign literature posted to homes in @entity4 patients in @entity4 are suffering lengthening delays to receive treatment and waiting time targets have not been met for more than four years			1
a @entity10 leaflet currently being sent to constituencies across @entity41 boasts about the party ’s ‘ plan for the @entity3 ’ and includes several images of nurses , doctors and hospitals			0
but the version being delivered to @entity50 homes has been modified so it makes no mention of the health service or @entity10 ’s appalling record there			1
the @entity41 pamphlet , which has the headline ‘ building an @entity3 with time to care ’ , has a picture on the front - page of mr @entity0 and @entity10 ’s shadow health secretary @entity58 visiting a hospital			1
the @entity10 leaflet sent to @entity50 voters includes the party ’s plans for immigration , but does not have a single mention of the @entity3 and includes none of the images of the health service it warns ‘ our @entity3 is at risk ’ alongside details of how @entity10 will introduce new controls on immigration			1
the version of the leaflet sent to @entity50 voters also includes the party ’s plans for immigration , but does not have a single mention of the @entity3 and includes none of the images of the health service			1
instead it talks about issues such as raising the minimum wage , freezing energy bills and introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax			0
@entity10 ’s candidates in @entity4 have also chosen to avoid talking about the @entity3 in literature sent to voters			2
constituents in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 have all received letters from their local candidates setting out what they would do if elected , but none of them a single mention of the health service			0
@entity10 's leaflet in @entity41 makes great play of his policies on the @entity3 health secretary @entity104 said : ‘ @entity0 wants to airbrush out the chaos his party has caused in the @entity50 health service			1
‘ @entity10 cut the @entity3 budget there by eight per cent and now @entity4 has the worst urgent ambulance response times since records began			2
‘ we know he wants to “ weaponise ” the @entity3 in @entity41 , but in @entity4 his party do n’t even defend their record			0
‘ in @entity41 we invested in the @entity3 and are committed to supporting hardworking staff – while @entity10 turn their back on the @entity3 in @entity4 , and still have n’t learnt that patients must always come before politics			2
’ mr @entity0 has been accused of saying in private that he wants to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity3 during the election campaign			2
as he launched @entity10 ’s health manifesto in @entity119 earlier this week , he said : ‘ the future of our @entity3 is at stake in this general election			1
’ a @entity124 report this week found waiting time targets have not been met by the @entity10 - run government since september 2010 and performance has been getting worse			2
by contrast , the @entity3 in @entity41 and @entity128 , where @entity10 is not in power , is performing better against tougher targets			0
according to the report , one in ten patients in @entity4 had to wait more than 26 weeks for treatment - the target is one in 20 - and three per cent waited more than 36 weeks in march last year			0
it added that the causes for the longer waits ' boil down to the inability of @entity4 as a whole to sustainably match the supply of healthcare with demand for services '			0
however , there has been a significant jump in satisfaction with the @entity3 among @entity10 voters in the last year			0
some 69 per cent of supporters declared themselves satisfied with the system - up 11 points on 2013 and slightly ahead of @entity154 voters ( up five at 68 per cent ) and @entity155 ( unchanged at 67 per cent )			0
data from the latest @entity159 - published by @entity161 health @entity158 - found dissatisfaction across the board was at its lowest ever , with only 15 per cent giving the thumbs down			0
and an overall satisfaction score of 65 per cent meant this was the second best year for the @entity3 since 1983 , topped only by 2010 .			0

@entity10 *promises* to put the @entity3 at the heart of general election campaign
but no mention of the health service in leaflets sent to @entity50 voters
@entity0 embarrassed by the poor - state of the @entity10 - run @entity3 in @entity4
poll shows satisfaction with the @entity3 is highest among @entity10 supporters
