by @entity0 @entity1 won the @entity2 by a single stoke on sunday for his first @entity5 victory since 2010			1
@entity6 shot a 7 - under 63 and finished at 17 - under 263			1
he earned $ 954,000 and 500 @entity8 points in the final regular - season event			2
the @entity10 had four birdies and an eagle on the front nine , added a birdie on the par - 5 15th and took the lead into the clubhouse			1
all smiles : the @entity10 beams with the @entity18 after winning the @entity2 always time for a selfie : @entity6 poses with the trophy after being crowned champion in @entity22 he then watched the rest of the field stumble late , giving him his fourth @entity5 title and first since the 2010 @entity27			1
@entity28 and @entity29 tied for second			0
@entity28 had a 64 , and @entity29 shot 66			1
@entity29 needed a par on the final hole to force a playoff , but he rolled his 11 - foot putt inches past the hole			1
@entity36 was two strokes back after his 67			0
@entity38 , @entity39 and third - round leader @entity40 finished at 14 under			0
@entity6 had to wait about 40 minutes after his round ended before his victory was secure			2
he closed his round with three straight pars , tapping in from about 2 feet on 18 and hoping it was good enough			0
in the zone : @entity6 won his first @entity5 title since 2010 with a fantastic final round it was - because the crowd near the top of the leaderboard thinned itself out			1
@entity40 was at 17 under and appeared to be headng for his sixth @entity5 victory before he ran into trouble on 14 and picked up his third bogey of the tournament and second of the day			2
he followed with four straight pars , leaving him needing a birdie on the final hole to tie @entity6			2
he had one on saturday - but could n't do it again			0
he wound up with a double bogey after his tee shot bounced past a cart path and out of bounds			0
that came after @entity29 also could n't catch @entity6			1
the @entity70 's second shot on 18 fell short of the green and his 70 - foot birdie putt from the front edge rolled well past the hole before he was wide with his par putt			1
letting it slip : @entity77 crumbled on the final day and missed a vital putt on the 18th hole congestion atop the leaderboard was expected after 12 players entered their last trip around @entity84 within three strokes of third - round leader @entity40 , who was at 14 under through three rounds			1
and @entity6 was n't one of them			0
he began five strokes back but made a quick trip up the leaderboard , with three birdies and an eagle among his first five holes to move to 15 under and put himself within striking distance			0
the other main subplot here this week was the last - gasp push for spots in the @entity5 's playoffs , which begin next week at the @entity103 in @entity104			2
@entity36 , who arrived at no. 158 on the points list , was briefly at 17 under but slipped off the pace by closing with two bogeys that also helped keep him out of the @entity103 field			0
he finished at no. 129			0
@entity110 , 125th at the start of the week , tied for 18th to put himself safely in the field			2
@entity112 , who was at no. 136 , was near the lead all weekend but his tie for 14th could only propel him to no. 127 .			0

@entity10 shot seven - under in his final round to finish ahead of @entity29 , who missed a par putt on 18th that would have forced a play - off
win is @entity6 ' fourth @entity5 title , but only his first since 2010 @entity27
he began the day five shots off lead but *stunning* start put him in the *mix*
