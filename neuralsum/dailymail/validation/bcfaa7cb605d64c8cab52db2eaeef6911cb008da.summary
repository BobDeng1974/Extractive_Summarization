and so finally it arrives			0
the clash we have been waiting so long for			0
the top - of - the - bill dust - up which for many is the highlight of the meeting and one which is quite simply too close to call			1
@entity8 ’s @entity7 versus @entity10 - trained @entity9 in the @entity11			1
@entity7 was the imperious winner of the race in 2013 but could not defend his title 12 months ago because of illness			1
in his absence , @entity9 galloped away with his crown displaying the same disdain for the leaden - footed gallopers chasing him			1
@entity22 riding @entity7 celebrates victory in the queen mother @entity24 in 2013 @entity7 clears a fence on his way to winning the race two years ago both pack a killer punch and both are battled scarred giants			1
both also hail from stables reluctant to admit the possibility of defeat			0
if they were boxers , they would probably be nose - to - nose , eyes bulging , refusing to be the first to blink			1
but underneath would be a grudging respect borne not only out of mutual ability but also shared battles against adversity			0
they have met once before in the @entity44 at @entity45 in december 2013			1
but it was a race memorable for the wrong reason as jockey @entity22 pulled up @entity7 after the seventh fence with a fibrillating heart problem			2
it was an issue which kept him off the track until his second to dodging bullets at @entity55 in january , a good performance off such a lengthy lay - off but one which only fuelled debate about whether the @entity7 of today is a shadow of the horse rated one of the best steeplechasers in his pomp			2
the delayed return had scuppered the pair ’s first anticipated clash in the @entity66 at @entity67 in december			2
@entity9 , ridden by @entity68 , galloped to the crown at last year 's @entity70 but by then @entity9 , who mopped up @entity72 ’s four grade one two - mile chases in @entity7 ’s absence , had also been sidelined			1
in his case it was a hip injury which initially had @entity10 fearing his season might be over			0
but after a blip when @entity10 ’s jockey son @entity79 was unseated in last month ’s @entity80 at @entity81 , confidence was restored with a smooth winning performance at @entity83			0
the debate over their relative merits and how much talent they retain has been endless but now the time for talking is over			0
@entity8 ( left ) , the most successful trainer in @entity70 history , has shown trademark patience in nursing @entity7 back into shape			1
he said : ‘ it will be the clash of the @entity70			1
it is what we wanted last year and did n’t happen			2
it will be a hell of a clash			0
they have got a crown that we want back			0
i think we have a chance			2
you ca n’t be confident but i am hopeful			0
he is in seriously good shape and doing everything we have remotely asked him to do			0
@entity7 ( left ) finished second to dodging bullets in comeback at @entity55 in january @entity10 celebrates with @entity9 after claiming victory last year ‘ i am not saying he is back to his very best			1
when he was , he was absolutely ridiculously unbeatable			0
it did n’t matter what anyone threw at him			0
i am not saying he is still like that but he is in seriously good shape			0
’ but @entity68 is equally bullish for @entity9			1
he said : ‘ i am hoping will see the same horse as last year and i am pretty sure they will			2
at the start of the season i thought he was working better last year			2
i think we will see the real @entity9 turn up and he will give them all a hell of race			1
’ the danger , of course , is that all the focus on the big two leads to a talented rival being underestimated , just as when @entity130 gatecrashed the 2010 @entity131 billed as the @entity132 versus @entity134 show			0
lining up against them is @entity137 - trained @entity136 , whose breeder @entity138 was thinking more @entity139 and @entity55 when he sent dam @entity140 to stallion @entity142			2
@entity22 acknowledges the crowd after being lead into the winner 's enclosure in 2013 the three - time champion flat jockey will be at the track to watch the form horse of the season and winner of both the @entity151 and @entity153 run			1
then there is @entity156 - trained @entity155 , who was just a head away in the @entity159 from winning at his third consecutive festival , 12 months ago			1
@entity137 also saddles much improved mr @entity161 , the mount of @entity163			0
the @entity70 is rightly billed as the @entity165 racing			1
that make the two - mile queen mother @entity167 the 100metres final			2
fast , furious and compelling … and almost impossible to call .			0

*sprinter* @entity169 won the @entity11 in 2013
but was not given the chance to defend his title last year *due* to illness
@entity9 galloped away with the title in 2014 with *comfortable* win
the pair go head - to - head in the race on day two of the @entity70
