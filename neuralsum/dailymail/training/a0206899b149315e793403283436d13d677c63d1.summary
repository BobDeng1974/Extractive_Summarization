by @entity0 published : 09:44 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 20 june 2013 threesome : @entity2 admitted downloading indecent images of his ex-girlfriend onto cds and putting them in envelopes addressed to her family and colleagues but denied mailing them a 62 - year - old male witch has avoided jail after photos of him having a threesome with his 30 - year - old girlfriend and an unnamed man were mailed to her mother and work colleagues			1
@entity2 was devastated at the end of his brief relationship with the woman after she began an affair with a separate man			0
in what was described as a cathartic ritual , he downloaded 51 of the indecent images onto 13 separate dvds and labelled them with her name and the words ' the @entity32 '			1
the discs were then sent to addresses in her home town of @entity38 , including the @entity39 where she worked , numerous pubs and hotels , a taxi firm , hairdressers and the local boating club			0
but despite mr @entity46 admitting he had carefully packaged the discs in envelopes , he said he had never intended to send them and they were posted by a friend who had found them in his home in @entity54 , @entity55			1
mr @entity46 , who describes himself as ' a witch ' , had several sexual encounters with the 30 - year - old when she visited @entity54 for a family holiday in october 2011 , @entity56 heard			1
prosecutor @entity61 said : ' they arranged to meet again and it was agreed @entity46 would bring along a male friend to take part in consensual sexual activity with the woman and himself			1
' while that was taking place , photographs of a sexually explicit nature were taken and she was aware of this			0
' following the holiday she returned home and continued to contact mr @entity46 by phone and text messages			2
after another visit to @entity55 six weeks later , he sent her a number of @entity81 presents to her home , along with gifts for members of her family			0
@entity46 then discovered she had started a relationship with another man from the @entity54 area and as a result their relationship came to an end			2
he asked her to return the gifts he had sent her which she did apart from one , and it was after then that he downloaded 51 of the photographs onto discs			0
one by one the discs started to be received by businesses and individuals on the @entity100 , including the victim 's own mother			0
mr @entity61 said : ' several of the individuals contacted the police and when police searched @entity46 's home address he handed over four similar discs with the same labelling			2
significant : mr @entity46 describes himself as ' a witch ' and said he chose to prepare 13 discs as the number has a special significance for him - but he maintains they were posted by a friend who found them in his hall ' when he was interviewed he said he had become obsessed with the woman and the breakdown in their relationship had affected him very badly			1
' however , mr @entity46 told the court that despite previously saying that he had sent the discs , he had lied during his police interview to protect his new partner			1
he said he had suspected she sent them as he claimed she hated the victim after seeing the emotional breakdown he had suffered following their split			0
it was not until the autumn of 2012 that another woman , @entity133 , confessed that she had bought stamps and posted them on his behalf after finding them in the hallway of his home , saying she assumed he had intended to send them			2
mr @entity46 said he had prepared 13 discs and the number 13 was of great significance to him			1
' i am a witch and i do things completely differently , ' he said			2
' they were not for sending but it was a symbolic thing i was doing			0
not guilty : mr @entity46 was cleared by the court of sending offensive communications because the prosecution could not prove he posted the discs ' i had a complete breakdown after the relationship ended and lost three stone in weight and was feeling very stressed			1
' downloading the photos onto discs was my way of dealing with this and i did a lot of research on the internet and found names and addresses of individuals and businesses and put the discs into envelopes but then put them away			0
' i put all my frustrations and anger into it and that was my way of dealing with it , but they were never ever meant to be sent			0
' mr @entity46 's friend ms @entity133 , also from @entity54 , said that she had found a large number of envelopes in @entity46 's hallway and had taken them to a post office where she weighed them , bought stamps and then posted them to the various addresses not realising what they contained			1
in a written statement the victim explained that mr @entity46 had discovered her affair with the other man after she was tricked into accepting a friend request he had sent to her on @entity189 while posing as a female			1
the police in @entity38 then contacted her saying that various people and businesses had started receiving the discs containing the explicit images			0
she said : ' he was bitter about me breaking contact with him and when i learned about the images he had sent i was shocked and felt physically sick			0
' mr @entity46 , of @entity198 , @entity54 , denied 11 counts of sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature between march 1 , 2012 and march 31 , 2012 when he appeared before @entity56 sitting at @entity203 on tuesday			2
he was found not guilty after chairman of the @entity205 said it had not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that mr @entity46 was the person who had sent the discs .			1

@entity46 prepared cds of *illicit* images after break - up
but court heard they were posted by a friend who found them in his house
male witch said he only made cds as ' cathartic ritual ' and did not send them
