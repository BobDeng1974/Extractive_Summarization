by @entity0 @entity1 has revealed it is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the @entity4			1
following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough , the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them			1
because @entity11 have to be displayed on different devices , they are tightly controlled by the @entity13			1
spreading like wildfire : the top trending word of the year so far is emoji Â¿ small digital images ( pictured ) used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are used by millions of people in emails and on social media emoji were originally popular in @entity24 , and widely used online			2
however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere			0
@entity26 electronic messages and webpages , whose use is spreading outside @entity24			0
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means " picture " ( e ) + " letter " ( moji )			2
icons are standardised , and include some specific to @entity26 culture , such as a bowing ( apologizing ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , @entity26 curry , and sushi			2
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into @entity13 , allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could noww be added			2
at present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white			0
however , only two of the symbols seem to be @entity59 and none are black			0
since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the @entity13 - a @entity62 - based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms , software producers , user groups and @entity66 does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set			2
the latest disclosure came after @entity1 boss @entity72 was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue			1
@entity1 's @entity75 replied , telling @entity76 : ' @entity72 forwarded your email to me			1
' we agree with you			0
' our emoji characters are based on the @entity13 standard , which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms			0
' there needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set , and we have been working closely with the @entity13 in an effort to update the standard			1
' @entity88 joined the calls to make emoji more diverse the diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to @entity93 calling on @entity1 to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard			1
' of the more than 800 @entity99 , the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely @entity59 and another in a turban , ' it says			0
' there 's a white boy , girl , man , woman , elderly man , elderly woman , blonde boy , blonde girl and , we 're pretty sure , [ video game character ] @entity110			0
' a petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to @entity1 's keyboard ' but when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys , there 's a staggering lack of minority representation			1
' it added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same - sex couple , and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones .			0

stars including @entity88 have called for more diversity
@entity1 says it is working with the body that controls emoji to expand them
