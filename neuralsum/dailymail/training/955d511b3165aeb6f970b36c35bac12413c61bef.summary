by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a family doctor is being investigated after it emerged an elderly patient of his changed her will days before her death to leave his daughter a share of her £ 560,000 - plus estate			1
@entity11 , 87 , killed herself with an overdose of pills which her sister said had been prescribed by her gp , dr @entity16			1
nine days earlier she altered her will to state that her late husband 's car and the couple 's £ 250,000 bungalow should go to the 63 - year - old gp 's daughter @entity22 , who friends believe mrs @entity11 had never met			1
@entity11 , pictured with her late husband , @entity24 , killed herself nine days after changing her will yesterday her relatives said she could not have been of sound mind when she changed the will and insisted she must have fallen victim to ' criminal acts '			1
mrs @entity11 , who had no children , died in november 2010			1
she had lost her husband @entity24 , 86 , to cancer 11 days before she altered the will			1
she had originally planned to leave everything to her two sisters in @entity37 , the couple 's only surviving relatives			2
but yesterday the youngest sister , @entity39 , said she had been stunned to hear the house and car had gone to the @entity15 's daughter			1
much of the rest of the cash – in the region of £ 300,000 – was left to another individual			1
money was also left to four charities , but mrs @entity11 's sisters @entity49 and mrs @entity39 were left just a watch and some jewellery			1
mrs @entity39 accused police of failing to investigate the matter properly			2
she claimed the fact that her sister 's suicide note was written in @entity58 was suspicious because she ' still spoke and wrote in @entity59 '			2
mrs @entity39 even suggested that she did not think her sister would have taken her own life in the way alleged			2
although she acknowledged that her sister had spoken about taking her life after the death of her husband , a former salesman , she said her sister had planned to go ' somewhere like @entity66 in @entity67 – not by taking pills on her own '			2
mrs @entity11 named 23 - year - old @entity69 ( right ) - the daughter of her doctor dr @entity16 ( left ) - as one of two beneficiaries @entity74 – who had lost the suicide note by the time of mrs @entity11 's inquest – have already been criticised by a coroner over the ' shoddiness ' of their investigation into the death			1
mrs @entity39 , 69 , speaking from her home in the spa town of @entity85 near @entity86 , told the @entity87 that she and mrs @entity49 , 75 , had spent three years trying to find out why the will was changed			1
she said : ' we were very close and i would ring @entity11 almost every day			2
this is not the sort of thing she would do			0
i feel there have been criminal acts carried out here			0
' she was confused before she died			2
she told me a financial adviser was trying to make her make a new will			0
her will was completely changed days before she died and was drawn up by a different solicitor to the original will she had			1
' a friend of the @entity102 , who did not wish to be named , also held suspicions about the suicide note			2
the friend said it was written on expensive writing paper , but mrs @entity11 was notoriously frugal and would not have bought such paper			1
the change in the will meant that her doctor 's daughter received mrs @entity11 's £ 250,000 bungalow @entity116 @entity115 is investigating the doctor 's connection to the will and his surgery 's ' medicine management ' in relation to mrs @entity11			1
she met her husband when he was stationed in @entity37 during the @entity124			0
they moved back to his home city of @entity127 in 1949			0
at an inquest in november 2011 , @entity129 coroner @entity128 recorded a verdict of suicide but said ' there may well have been a suggestion ' the @entity102 were ' vulnerable to influence from an outside third party '			2
@entity39 , pictured with her sister @entity137 , is challenging the will because she does not believe her sister was of sound mind when she signed it mrs @entity11 and her husband were treated at @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity129 , for many years but she agreed with professionals – including dr @entity16 – who had considered mrs @entity11 to be of sound mind when she made the new will			1
the pensioner was on medication for what is thought to have been a heart condition when she died			0
dr @entity16 , known as @entity152 , is based at @entity143 in the @entity144 area of @entity127			0

@entity22 , 23 , is listed amongst the administrative staff			0
the family live in upmarket @entity158 , @entity129			0
there was no answer at their extended cottage yesterday			0
@entity115 said an investigation into aspects of mrs @entity11 's case was ongoing			1
in a statement @entity166 said the surgery had ' engaged fully with the @entity115 investigation '			0
@entity170 , 54 , the sister of dr @entity16 's wife , said : ' this is unbelievable			0
@entity22 is a lovely girl			0
it is very sad what has happened but @entity152 is the last person to take advantage of someone			0
' a spokesman for @entity74 said : ' we have investigated every aspect of this inquiry			0
there was no evidence to suggest any criminal activity and the case was closed			0

doctor had treated @entity11 and her husband for many years
she killed herself in 2010 , just 11 days after her husband died of cancer
but before her suicide she *rewrote* her will to cut her two sisters out
instead she left £ 250,000 bungalow to daughter of the gp who treated her
coroner found mrs @entity11 was of sound mind when she changed her will
her sister wants an investigation to find out if she was thinking *straight*
