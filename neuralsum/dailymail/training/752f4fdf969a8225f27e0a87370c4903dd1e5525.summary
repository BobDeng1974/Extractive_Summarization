the @entity0 has admitted that global warming has stalled			1
officials say that by 2017 , temperatures will not have risen significantly for nearly 20 years			2
they concede that previous forecasts were inaccurate – and have come under fire for attempting to ‘ bury bad news ’ by publishing the revised data on @entity8			2
rise : the earlier @entity0 predictions show a much sharper rise in projected global temperatures through to 2016 ... fall : but the new computer model predicts temperatures will stay relatively flat now a press release , published yesterday , has confirmed that over the next five years temperatures will be 0.43 degrees above the 1971 - 2000 average , instead of the previously forecast 0.54 degrees – a 20 per cent reduction			1
this rise would be only slightly higher than the 0.4 - degree rise recorded in 1998 , an increase which is itself attributed by forecasters to an exceptional weather phenomenon			2
with all but 0.03 degrees of the increase having occurred by 1998 , the revision means that no further significant increases to the planet ’s temperature are expected over the next few years			0
the figures have been seized on by sceptics of man - made climate change , who claim that global warming has flatlined despite a large rise in greenhouse emissions in recent decades			1
dr @entity34 , science adviser to the @entity35 , said : ‘ that the global temperature standstill could continue to at least 2017 would mean a 20 - year period of no statistically significant change in global temperatures			1
‘ such a period of no increase will pose fundamental problems for climate models			0
if the latest @entity0 prediction is correct , then it will prove to be a lesson in humility			1

phenomena like this is believed by many to be caused by global warming however , dr @entity57 of the @entity58 said : ‘ global warming is not “ at a standstill ” but does seem to have slowed down since 2000 , in comparison to the rapid warming of the world since the 1970s			2
‘ in fact , consistent with rising greenhouse gases , heat is continuing to build up beneath the ocean surface			0
’ he was backed by @entity68 of the @entity69 , who said it would be wrong to interpret that warming had stopped			0
however , he also condemned the @entity0 for releasing data without an explanation of its full meaning			1
‘ it ’s true to say this is n’t the @entity0 ’s finest hour , ’ he said			1
‘ the sceptics have simply exploited that fact			0
i think on this particular occasion the @entity0 has fallen short of the standards one would expect of them			2
’ @entity84 mp @entity83 said the @entity0 ’s short - term forecasts had improved , but their climate change analysis was ‘ poor ’			1
he said : ‘ by putting out the information on christmas eve they were just burying bad news – that they have got their climate change forecast wrong			0
‘ for a science - based organisation , they should be more up front , both about their successes and failures			0
’ the @entity0 said the updated five - year predictions were a result of a new modelling system , which takes into account changes in ocean surface temperatures , and was released as soon as practically possible			1
evidence : temperatures will not rise as rapidly as feared , according to @entity0 figures it claims the slow - down in temperature rises after a steep increase in the 1990s could be explained by natural variability , changes in solar activity , and the movements of the oceans			1
forecasts of continued global warming are driven largely by increasing levels of greenhouse gases			1
experts warn that without efforts to reduce emissions , the world is on course for dangerous temperature rises in the next century			0
professor @entity124 of the @entity125 said : ‘ a lot of people were claiming , in the run - up to the @entity130 2009 conference , that warming was accelerating and it is all worse than we thought			0
‘ what has happened since then has demonstrated that it is foolish to extrapolate short - term climate trends			0
‘ while every new year brings in welcome new data to help us rule out the more extreme scenarios for the future , it would be equally silly to interpret what has happened since the early 2000s as evidence that the warming has stopped			0

earlier forecasts predicted a much steeper rise in global temperatures
but latest figures from @entity0 show slower rise than previously warned
figures raise *questions* about the true danger posed by greenhouse gasses
