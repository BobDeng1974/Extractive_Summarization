he 's the heir to the @entity2 baronetcy and the @entity4 banking fortune that goes with it but @entity4 has more than money on his mind			1
rather than follow his father @entity8 into banking , the @entity7 educated 28 - year - old chose to become a magician			1
now better known as @entity13 , @entity12 is one of @entity16 's hottest young magic acts with a following that rivals those of @entity18 , @entity19 and even @entity20			1
it was , he says , a dream come true			2
' i get to explore the history of magic , i meet with some of my all - time heroes of magic , i recreate some of the most iconic illusions of all time and i share it around the world with a host of wonderful people , ' he says , enthusiastic			1
' this series is the culmination of a 20 - year obsession with , devotion to and study of magic			1
' born to @entity56 , 9th @entity2 and his wife @entity57 in 1986 , @entity55 first became interested in magic at the age of six			1
but it was n't until a trip to @entity62 's , the oldest magic shop in the @entity16 , aged eight that his ambition to swap money for magic crystallised			2
' from that moment , nothing else was ever an option , ' he laughs			2
' i briefly attempted the sensible option - banking - but that was a crashing disaster and i was miserable , so i ran away with the circus instead			1
' clever : money - @entity4 says his obsession with magic began more than 20 years ago banking dynasty : money - @entity4 ' family founded @entity79 which is used by the queen travels : in his new show , @entity30 with @entity13 , the magician travels the world in search of new tricks his repertoire of illusions combined with a love of card - sharping - his early tricks were practised on his @entity7 schoolmates - have made him into one of @entity16 's most popular magicians , although unlike @entity95 and @entity19 , he 's not a man for big bangs and well - publicised stunts			1
indeed , when asked about his favourite magicians , he plumps for the subtle @entity101 @entity100 , whose magic he describes as being ' filled with poetry and theatre '			0
his own style owes much to @entity100 's influence and he remains fascinated with subtle trickery and challenging illusions			0
' magic is like music , ' he explains			0
' nobody is born able to play a guitar or piano and there 's no shortcut to sitting down for hundreds and thousands of hours , for years on end , to learn every small minutiae required			0
' to me , an insatiable hunger to look under every stone and discover everything you can about the subject is the number one thing you need to become a magician			1
' magic in action : money - @entity4 performs the classic interlinking rings trick for a pair of baffled onlookers passion : although @entity4 briefly tried the family business , he was always thinking about magic instead subtle : unlike @entity20 and @entity19 , @entity12 takes a more low - key approach to magic tricks money - @entity4 ' background - the @entity7 education , the banking fortune , the title - does make him an unusual addition to the world of magic and he admits that few of his friends have chosen similar careers			1
' whenever i attempted something else , i ended up sitting there thinking about magic , so when the time came to leave university there was only one choice			0
' it 's a great irony that five or so years on , a great many friends who initially went into ‘ sensible ’ careers are now fleeing en masse to set up their own businesses , ' he smiles			0
' it ’s wonderful to see			0
' his family , who he hopes ' are very proud ' of his success , have proved supportive , although they rarely get to see him in action			2
' growing up i was very private about magic , ' he admits			0
' even today i try to keep my private life and my magic life separate			0
' it ’s very seldom my family or close friends actually ever see me perform			2
' lucky for the rest of us then , that we can .			0
