by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:36 est , 15 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:26 est , 16 december 2013 consultants could face the sack for refusing to work at weekends as part of a shake - up ordered by the @entity8 ’s top doctor			1
professor sir @entity9 also plans to impose fines of around £ 12million on hospitals where patients experience poor care on saturdays and sundays			1
the changes are being brought in after research published in the summer showed that 4,400 lives are being lost needlessly in hospitals every year because of a lack of senior doctors and because key scans and tests are not carried out			1
professor sir @entity9 plans to impose fines of around £ 12million on hospitals where patients experience poor care at the weekends patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if admitted on a sunday rather than on a wednesday , another study found			1
but for certain operations it can be much higher			0
other research showed that patients who have planned operations at the weekend rather than on a monday are 82 per cent more likely to die			1
at weekends , patients are usually left under the care of junior doctors who may only have a few months ’ experience with one or two consultants ‘ on - call ’ answering their mobile phones from home			1
yesterday senior doctors refused to confirm whether they will ask for more money to work weekends although many believe they deserve higher hourly rates			1
the @entity45 , their union , is holding talks with @entity8 officials about changes to consultants ’ contracts			1
@entity45 chairman dr @entity51 would not discuss details of these negotiations but pointed out that hourly rates for nurses and other staff who work weekends is far more attractive			1
sir @entity9 , the medical director of @entity59 , wants to remove a key clause in consultants ’ contracts that allows them to opt out of non-urgent weekend work			1
patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if admitted on a sunday rather than a wednesday and for some operations it can be even higher this would mean they would be sacked for refusing to work at this time , although officials said this would only be in the worst circumstances			2
hospitals that fail to have enough consultants working over the weekend or to provide x-rays , ultrasound scans and other key tests could also be fined up to 2.5 per cent of their annual income from the @entity8			1
a typical hospital gets £ 500million a year so the maximum penalty would be £ 12.5million			0
the plans – which will be rolled out over the next three years – will mean all patients admitted to hospital will see a consultant within 14 hours			2
some currently wait three days if they come in on a friday			0
critically - ill patients will have x-rays , heart scans , mri scans or blood tests within one hour , urgent cases within 12 hours and everyone else within 24 hours			2
sir @entity9 , @entity59 ’s medical director who is also a heart surgeon , said : ‘ it seems strange in many ways that we should start to wind down on a friday afternoon and warm up on a sunday while operating theatres are empty , outpatient clinics echo , expensive diagnostic kit is n’t being used and in the meantime people are waiting for diagnosis and treatment			2
‘ when those patients are admitted they get a diagnosis quicker and the appropriate treatment is started more quickly			2
’ @entity106 died after surgeons removed her ovary instead of her appendix mother - to - be @entity106 died after two trainee surgeons operating on a sunday removed the wrong body part			0
the 32 - year - old – who was five months ’ pregnant with her fourth child – was admitted to @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 with appendicitis but medics took out an ovary instead			0

mrs @entity106 suffered a miscarriage shortly after being re-admitted in october 2011			0
just 48 hours later , the teaching assistant died of major organ failure on the operating table just as doctors were finally removing the infected appendix			2
her husband @entity131 , 53 , said earlier this year : ‘ my wife ’s death could have been prevented , i am sure of it			0
' by the time they realised how serious the situation was – and they promised us all the best consultants – it was too late			0
‘ this is neglect , this is an unlawful killing			0
’ he said on the @entity147 ’s @entity146 show : ‘ that means that patients spend less time in hospital and the hospital as a whole runs more efficiently			2
‘ people are still kept waiting at the weekend for a diagnosis			0
we have a system that is not built around the convenience of patients and is not compassionate to patients for part of the week			1
’ if hospitals are relying too heavily on junior doctors at weekends , the @entity8 will force managers to bring in consultants in their place			1
patients will also be able to have minor surgery at the weekend such as for hernias and on hips and knees so they do not have to take time off work			2
@entity45 chairman dr @entity51 would not say whether it would ask for more money consultants to work weekends sir @entity9 added : ‘ why should somebody have to take time off work , why should someone else have to take time off work to take them to and from hospital , when , if they were to have their operations on a saturday , they could spend sunday recovering and , in many cases , get back to work sooner ? ’ the @entity190 watchdog has been urged to check for levels of weekend care during routine inspections of hospitals			1
@entity59 – which runs the @entity195 – estimates the plans will cost the @entity8 an extra £ 1billion a year			1
its annual budget is about £ 105billion			0
but @entity45 chairman dr @entity51 said other @entity8 staff including x-ray specialists , administration staff and social workers also needed to work at weekends to ensure high levels of care			1
he refused to comment on whether the @entity45 would ask for more money for consultants to work weekends as part of discussions about their contract			2
nurses currently get time and a half for working weekends while doctors receive time and a third , he said			1
a survey of 4,500 consultants by the @entity45 in september found that most were in favour of ‘ increased financial remuneration ’ for working in the evening and at weekends			0
health secretary @entity221 said : ‘ patients should be at the heart of the @entity8 and be able to depend on it every day – not just monday to friday			1
’ the weekend working shake - up follows a number of key studies which warned that patients are far more likely to die or suffer major complications if they are admitted at the weekend			0
@entity59 has calculated that 4,400 lives could be saved every year if hospitals offered the same level of care at weekends as they do during the week			1
patients undergoing planned surgery on saturday or sunday are 82 per cent more likely to die than if they have their operation on a monday , according to a study by researchers at @entity239 published in the spring			0
last year , scientists from @entity241 found patients are 16 per cent more likely to die if they are admitted on a sunday compared to a wednesday			0
the figure for saturday was 11 per cent			0
other studies also revealed an alarming difference in weekend death rates between hospitals			0
