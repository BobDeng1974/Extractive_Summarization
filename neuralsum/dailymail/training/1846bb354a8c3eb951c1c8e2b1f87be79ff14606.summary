by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 16 july 2013 the @entity1 has announced plans to provide £ 60 million for a revolutionary new rocket engine capable of taking people to @entity6 's stratosphere in just 15 minutes			1
the engine is called @entity8 , which stands for @entity9 , and was built by @entity11 firm @entity10			1
reaction engines claims @entity8 can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph ' spaceplane ' called @entity17			1
it is built by @entity11 firm reaction engines which plans to use the technology on a unique ' spaceplane ' called @entity17 , pictured the @entity27 - based company also add that at these speeds , a plane could theoretically travel from the @entity30 to @entity31 in under five hours			1
@entity32 , minister for universities and science , said the investment in @entity8 would provide support at a ' crucial stage ' to allow a full - scale prototype to be built			1
' we ’re investing £ 60 million in this and we expect them to go out and find private support as well , ' @entity32 told @entity43			0
' but we ’re backing this because it ’s technology that has been tested in the lab , it ’s been assessed by outside experts as right in principle			2
' now it needs to be built on a full - scale prototype before it can get commercial			0
' we think it ’s right to support it through that crucial stage			0
modern - day traditional aviation engines have to carry tanks of liquid oxygen when travelling at more than 1,900mph because they ca n't ' breathe ' oxygen			2
@entity60 helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion			2
@entity65 's @entity8 design uses a system of pipes , filled with helium			1
the air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat and the oxygen is carried to the engine			2
once in space , the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode			1
this means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and used to launch satellites , for example			2
@entity83 , founder of @entity10 , told @entity84 : ' @entity85 are stuck in a rut			0
the weight problem means it costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite			0
' the basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high speed it instantly heats up to @entity96 - which is unmanageably hot			1
' the challenge was to cool it back down to @entity99 in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine			0
' @entity83 continued : ' [ @entity8 ] would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply , to build space stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to earth			1
we could even construct spaceships for missions to other planets			0
' ' that ’s where too many great @entity11 ideas in the past have failed			1
' @entity32 is expected reveal details of the investment at this week 's @entity117 in @entity118			0
skylon is likely to be viewed a competitior to sir @entity123 ’s @entity122 business , in which people can experience six minutes of weightlessness during a sub-orbital spaceflights			0
sir @entity123 and his @entity122 company offer trips into space , that include six minutes of weightlessness , for around £ 121,000			2
@entity17 is expected to offer similar flights for cheaper , but has not announced any prices			2
figures from the company believe the skylon space place could cut the cost of space launches by around 95 per cent			1

when fitted to an aircraft , the engine is capable of travelling up to five times the speed of sound and will be used to send astronauts into space the @entity8 engine has taken part in 100 successful test runs and its design was recently validated by the @entity151 to validate the design			1

the @entity8 rocket engine was created by @entity11 firm reaction engines
it can be fitted to planes and travel up to five times the speed of sound
the company wants to use the technology on a ' spaceplane ' called @entity17
tests *suggest* it could cut the cost of space launches by 95 %
