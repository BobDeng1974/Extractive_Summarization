by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:22 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 23:18 est , 13 january 2013 bare - legged riders around the globe braved the winter weather and some stares from fellow commuters on sunday for the @entity8 - an annual celebration of freedom , subways - and skivvies			1
after events in cities like @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity12 followed suit , donning just their briefs and boxers in cities like @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
it started off as a prank by comedy group @entity27 that bemused a few embarrassed commuters but has since grown into a global phenomenon			0
' despite the threat of snow and bleak midwinter temperatures in @entity15 , many thrill seekers braved the weather and took to the @entity40 in the @entity81 's own version of the event			2
participants behave as if they do not know each other and - other than the lack of trousers - dress appropriately for winter donning hats , scarfs and a warm coat			0
the hilarious craze started back in 2002 when a handful of @entity21 pranksters decided to cause a stir on the subway			2
getting comfortable : a pantsless female rider in @entity60 , @entity61 , takes her seat on the train barefaced cheek : two female participants brave the cold weather and take to the @entity40 in just their underwear mind the gap : a gang of pranksters taking part in the @entity15 event make sure they stand behind the yellow line while waiting for their train disapproval : a man watches as participants in the @entity8 take the 6 train uptown in @entity21 @entity113 all : the event was orchestrated by @entity27 , a @entity21 - based prank collective that causes scenes of chaos and joy in public places just hanging around : some riders in the @entity21 subway ham it up for the camera as they participate in the event acting normally : those who take part are told to go about their everyday business and pretend not to know each other say cheese : other fully - clothed commuters take pictures of fellow passengers who are just in their pants on a packed @entity137 train untrussed @entity138 : commuters in @entity60 , @entity61 , also took to the train minus their trousers confused : passengers were bemused by less than fully - dressed commuters at a rail station in @entity145 colourful : some dressed in garish underwear as they removed their trousers to take part in the @entity8 in @entity145 today @entity150 : several riders in the @entity21 subway stand on the platform in their underwear spectacle : bemused riders watch as participants in the @entity8 take the 6 train downtown surprise : passengers on a @entity162 train look startled as one passenger , complete with warm jumper and wooly hat takes off his shoes and trousers untrussed : passengers on a @entity162 subway train might have their umbrellas to protect them from the rain , but they are likely to get wet legs without their trousers suiting up : participants shed their clothes to take part in the annual @entity8 in @entity177 , @entity178 pants off : participants of the @entity8 stand in a subway train in @entity24 one participant entered the train in just his underwear for seven consecutive stops and , if asked , were instructed to tell people that they ' just forgot ' their trousers			1
on the 8th stop , a final participant would enter the carriage selling trousers out of a duffel bag - much to the bemusement of other passengers			0
the annual event steadily grew each year with more and more people choosing to take part			2
but it nearly hit the buffers in 2006 when the stunt was halted by a @entity21 policeman			0
eight passengers were handcuffed in their underwear and taken into police custody			0
a judge later threw out the case because it is not illegal to wear just your underwear on the @entity210			0
spectacle : passengers look at a man not wearing pants , while riding in the subway during the annual @entity8 in @entity162 , @entity216 sprechen sie pants ? passengers look at a man without his pants on the subway during the @entity8 in @entity145 , @entity221 bottoms up : participants in the @entity8 wait to board an uptown 6 train in @entity21 confusing sight : a subway rider glances at a @entity227 participant aboard a train in @entity24 acting natural : riders resumed their usual subway activities , like reading - only without their trousers startling : onlookers watch as two girls chat nonchalantly on a @entity162 train earlier today the @entity227 event went global in 2008 with @entity236 in @entity61 joining eight @entity238 cities in taking part in the stunt			1
last year 's event saw tens of thousands of people daring to bare their underwear in 59 cities in 27 countries around the world			0
in @entity15 alone more than 150 took part			2
this year @entity248 startled fellow passengers on the @entity137			0
unlike freezing @entity15 participants , those who took part in @entity21 enjoyed a mild winter day , while those who took off their trousers in @entity60 basked in balmy summer weather			1
events also took place in cities such as @entity258 , @entity177 , @entity145 and @entity259			1
strange : passengers react to seeing a man without his pants on the subway during the annual @entity8 in @entity162 , @entity216 hilarious : a group of men share a laugh as they take part in @entity270 in @entity258 , @entity271 under - dressed on the underground : fellow passengers smile as two commuters board the train holding their trousers in the @entity271 capital @entity258 so good : passengers without pants queue to board a train and provide amusement to fellow travellers on the train in @entity258 undressed to impress : one commuter with a particularly loud pair of pants stands on the platform of a station in @entity177			1
