a group of schoolchildren has beaten the land speed record for a rocket - powered car , twice over , after their vehicles hit speeds of over 500mph ( 800km/h )			1
the young engineers from @entity7 beat the existing record of 287mph ( 460km/h ) set in march by @entity9 of @entity10 in @entity11			1
in total , the group put three car designs through their paces at a testing track in @entity17 - and all three were able to reach speeds in excess of 440mph ( 708km/h )			2
pictured is the @entity28 model the cars were each built by students at the @entity31 , in @entity32 , @entity7 , and were called @entity28			1
they were tested at the @entity35 track in @entity17			0
@entity36 reached speeds of 478.1mph ( 769.4km/h ) , and @entity38 followed with a speed of 448.9mph ( 722.4km/h ) – and then @entity40 took to the track			2

' we started with buying simple rocket kits , building them and firing them into the sky - then developed our ideas from there			0
' we thought before we did the official runs that we were in with a good chance - we were n't being cocky , but we had done lots of practice runs and knew how the cars were performing			0
