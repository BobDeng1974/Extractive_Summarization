by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 last night refused to choose between @entity3 and @entity4 in a sign that our relationship with the @entity8 may not be as special as once thought			1
the @entity10 president said both @entity4 and @entity11 are ‘ wonderful in their own ways ’ and - just like his two daughters - he would never choose between the two countries			1
he was speaking at the @entity16 during a state visit by unpopular @entity4 president @entity18 , whose colourful love life has captured the attention of the world			1
' and they are both gorgeous and wonderful , and i would never choose between them			0
' ' and that 's how i feel about my outstanding @entity39 partners			2
all of them are wonderful in their own ways			2
' @entity2 was speaking during a joint press conference with @entity4 president @entity18 , on the occasion of the first @entity46 by a @entity4 head of state since 1976			1
the move is the latest snub of @entity50 , after secretary of state @entity51 angered some in the @entity54 government by praising @entity4 as @entity8 's ' oldest ally ' and part of a coalition of the willing prepared to strike against @entity59 dictator @entity58 , whom he called a ' thug and murderer			1
' @entity51 made no mention of @entity3 in his speech on @entity59 , but praised @entity4 , @entity64 and even @entity65			1
in a coded swipe at the @entity54 , the president said : ‘ a lot of people think something should be done but nobody wants to do it			1
’ rivals ? @entity54 prime minister @entity28 and @entity4 president @entity18 may both want super-best - friend status with @entity75 , but @entity2 is no longer playing favorites today , the prime minister focused on the floods and told the press that ' money was no object ' deteriorating relationship : @entity28 and @entity2 walk side - by - side during the @entity84 last june insisting that the use of chemical weapons is the ‘ kind of offence that is a challenge to the world , ’ he confirmed the @entity10 was considering a ‘ limited , narrow act ’ intended to deter their use			1
weeks later , @entity28 failed to get @entity93 to vote for the use of military force in the country			0
@entity98 mps feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to mr @entity28 ’s standing at home and abroad – and to the @entity10 ‘ special relationship			2
’ at the time , defence secretary @entity104 said last night it would be deeply ‘ uncomfortable ’ to see the @entity8 and @entity4 working together ‘ while we stand and watch ’			2
' the @entity10 - @entity4 alliance has never been stronger , ' @entity2 said			1
' that 's good for @entity4			2
it 's good for the @entity8			0
it 's good for the world , because we share certain values and certain commitments and are willing to act on behalf of those commitments and values			0
' @entity2 appeared to cast aside an episode from the @entity118 administration that had @entity4 refusing to participate in a coalition effort to invade @entity120 while the @entity54 led the way			1
within weeks ' @entity4 fries ' were replaced in high profile eateries – including at least one congressional cafeteria on @entity125 – by ' freedom fries			2
' and a character on the animated comedy show @entity129 offered a label for the @entity4 that stuck : ' cheese - eating surrender monkeys			2
' @entity3 , meanwhile , enjoyed favored status in @entity75			2
then - prime minister @entity133 had famously promised after the 9/11 terror attacks in @entity135 and the @entity75 suburbs that @entity3 would stand ' shoulder to shoulder ' with the @entity8 people against a ' new evil of mass terrorism			0
' what a difference an election makes ! @entity118 and @entity133 once personified the ' special ' @entity10 - @entity54 relationship , partnering in an effort to oust @entity120 strongman @entity145 from power the @entity10 - @entity4 bilateral talks are happening on a global stage , with the very real possibility of putting @entity11 's collective nose out of joint despite his projection of a strong relationship between the @entity10 and @entity4 , @entity2 offered no word on tuesday about whether the result would be helpful to @entity11			1
a @entity4 journalist had noted that he ' actually praised @entity4 very warmly today ' and granted our president the first state visit of your second term			1
' ' does that mean that @entity4 has become the best @entity39 ally of the @entity10 and has replaced @entity3 in that role ? ' ' oh , my , ' a smiling @entity2 said , to a round of laughter			1
@entity18 followed @entity2 's lead with his own family comparison			1
' i have four children , ' he said through a translator , ' so that makes it even more difficult for me to make any choice at all			0
' ' but we 're not trying to be anyone 's favorite			0
' ' and i can see that our views converge on many issues			0
but it 's not about hierarchy ; it 's just about being useful to the world			0
' will @entity28 be pressed on @entity75 's ' special relationship ' with @entity50 during prime minister 's questions ? but the journalist 's question was n't meant to be playful			0
it continued with a more serious demand about the implications of whether @entity196 status exists between @entity75 and @entity197			0
' if so , ' came the zinger , ' why not extend to @entity4 the no - spying agreement that you have with @entity11 after the big scandal of the @entity203 ’s surveillance program ? ' @entity2 took issue with the premise of the question , cautioning that ' it 's not actually correct to say that we have a " no - spy agreement " with @entity3			1
that ’s not actually what happens			0
' ' we do n’t have – there ’s no country where we have a no - spy agreement , ' he said			0
' we have , like every other country , an intelligence capability			0
and then we have a range of partnerships with all kinds of countries			0
and we ’ve been in consultations with the @entity4 government to deepen those commitments			0

@entity2 and @entity18 took turns saying they could n't *declare* a ' *varotie* ' ally
@entity10 president refuses to say @entity3 was his favourite ally
**claimed** all @entity39 countries were both ' wonderful in their own ways '
comes after @entity51 refused to mention the @entity54 during speech on @entity59
secretary of state **claimed** @entity4 were the ' oldest ally ' and did not mention the @entity54
