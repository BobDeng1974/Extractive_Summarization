by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 04:07 est , 3 may 2012 human rights lawyers have threatened doctors who have removed asylum seekers from surgery lists gps are being warned that they face legal action if they refuse to accept illegal immigrants as patients			0
human rights lawyers have been threatening doctors who have removed failed asylum seekers from their surgery lists – even though they are not entitled to free @entity14 care			1
meanwhile , figures reveal that foreigners , including tourists and migrants , have been given an estimated £ 40million of free @entity14 treatment in the past three years			1
anyone who does normally live in the @entity21 – including tourists – is meant to pay for any @entity14 treatment they receive			1
the only exceptions are urgent care received in @entity26 departments or treatment for certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis			1
refugees and asylum seekers are given free @entity14 treatment , but if their application to remain in the @entity21 is turned down by the @entity33 they lose the entitlement			1
but government guidelines on when to provide free healthcare are vague and simply advise @entity5 to ‘ use their discretion ’			2
figures obtained by @entity40 show that some hospitals are managing to claw back only a quarter of the costs owed to them by so - called health tourists			1
its investigation also revealed that one surgery in @entity47 had been ordered to reinstate two failed asylum seekers from @entity49 after being threatened with legal action by human rights solicitors			0
doctors had removed the couple after their asylum application had been turned down by the @entity33			0
but they subsequently received a letter from @entity57 - based law firm @entity56 threatening legal action unless they were reinstated , and they have now been put back on the books			2
the manager of the surgery said that they were urged by their local primary care trust to reinstate the patients			0
the unnamed member of staff said : ‘ someone at the @entity70 read the letter and panicked			0
' hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people can not exploit the system			0
' ‘ do we just register everyone who is illegal ? ’ another practice in @entity78 was also told not to remove illegal immigrants in the face of similar threats			0
@entity83 mp @entity82 , who sits on the @entity84 , accused lawyers of ‘ piggy backing ’ on the @entity14			1
he said : ‘ gps are under enough pressure			0
they should not be made to feel accountable for not registering people who have no legal right to treatment			2
‘ i fear this is only the tip of the iceberg			0
in many cases , staff may not be asking people ’s nationality as it is beyond the hospital or clinic to recover the costs of treatment			2
refugees and asylum seekers are given free @entity14 treatment , but if their application to remain in the @entity21 is turned down by the @entity33 they lose the entitlement			1
‘ given that @entity14 resources are going to be stretched , these are savings which should be made			1
’ dr @entity109 , of the @entity110 , said : ‘ hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people can not exploit the system			0
’ the investigation obtained data from 35 hospital trusts in @entity118 showing that on average they had debts of £ 230,000 owed by foreigners since 2009			2
if that figure is replicated across all 168 hospital trusts in the country , then the @entity14 would collectively be owed £ 40million from health tourists			1
this included @entity128 in @entity129 , which had recovered only £ 1.5 million from the £ 3.5 million owed			0
another trust , @entity130 in the @entity131 , had managed to recover only 24 per cent of the £ 419,000 owed by foreign nationals			1
health minister @entity134 said : ‘ we wo n’t tolerate abuse of our @entity137			0
the @entity14 has a duty to anyone whose life or long - term health is at immediate risk , but it is not there to serve the health needs of the globe			2

foreign nationals , including migrants and tourists , have received £ 40m of free @entity14 treatment in last three years , figures show
