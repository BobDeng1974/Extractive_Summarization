his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier			0
' i hate @entity177 ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father @entity177 , who has blocked him from seeing the 22 - year - old in the hospital ' are you drinking ?

' @entity5 and @entity1 would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had			1
it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs			0

she was always covered in cigarette burns			0
' their relationship was also very volatile			0
' when @entity10 died @entity1 was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control @entity90 to get access to the money			2
she 'd do whatever he told her			0

they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around			0
' according to @entity237 : ' but @entity90 really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother			0
she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her			0
