by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 admitted to having dreamt about her @entity4 comeback during the seven years since she last played here , but she probably envisaged it lasting a little longer than 64 minutes			1
that is how long it took @entity9 and @entity10 to sweep away the @entity12 legend and her doubles partner @entity13			0
@entity1 , who lost in the third round of the singles in 2007 , was once box office gold at the @entity17			1
she won the title at 16 — one of five @entity21 singles crowns — and captivated with her wily tennis and youthful charm			2
not how she left it : @entity1 lost a doubles match in straight sets at @entity4 on wednesday back in the day : @entity1 won @entity4 as a teenager back in 1997 after losing 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 in front of a couple of hundred spectators on the relative wilderness of @entity33 , @entity1 shuffled off the court , flashing a weak smile to autograph hunters			1
it is easy to forget that at 33 , @entity1 is three months younger than @entity38 , who is still alive in the singles and doubles at @entity41			0
@entity1 is still enthusiastic about tennis , offering her services as a tv pundit and was courtside as @entity13 beat briton @entity45 in the singles			0
there were glimpses of that renowned tennis brain as she saved break point at the start of the second set but ultimately it was far from a dream return .			0

@entity1 won @entity4 singles ' title back in 1997
