it comes to something when even @entity2 looks surprised			1
after all , the former @entity4 coach has seen the @entity5 show many times before			1
he helped to construct it , to hone it			0
he could claim part - copyright			2
on the training fields of @entity4 ’s @entity11 training centre , on the slick , wet grass of the @entity13 and at the best @entity15 stadia , @entity2 has watched @entity5 make fools of many			1
here on wednesday night , however , as the current coach of @entity18 chose to return to his spiritual home , even he was left gasping , gaping and giggling at another night of remarkable productivity and beauty from the greatest footballer those of us on the south side of 50 have ever seen			2
@entity5 runs with the ball as the @entity4 man produces yet more genius at the @entity13 @entity5 evades the tackle as he runs towards goal during the @entity32 clash on wednesday @entity5 ( centre ) holds off the challenge of @entity36 's @entity35 ( left ) as @entity4 progress read @entity39 's match report from the @entity13 as @entity4 beat @entity36 1 - 0 to progress to the quarter - finals of the @entity32			1
@entity5 ’s free - kicks were n’t up to much on wednesday			1
three times he had the opportunity to beat @entity45 from just outside the penalty area			2
three times the ball flew over the crossbar			0
it was , in some ways , good to see that he is n’t perfect , that he does make mistakes			0
after all , if we accept that we have the first flawless footballer in our midst then where do we go from there ? pretty much everything else , however , was exemplary and it was a nutmeg on @entity58 by the near touchline in the first half that provoked one of the most memorable reactions of the season from @entity2			1
as @entity58 disappeared in to a place no footballer ever wishes to go , @entity5 was away up the field , scampering towards the retreating figures of @entity68 and @entity69 with savage intent			1
on nights like this , @entity5 will terrify the best defenders and , here , @entity36 ’s pair resembled pedestrians stranded on the central reservation of a motorway			1
lots of footballers can pull tricks , of course			0
@entity5 is n’t the only one with the moves			1
the key to his majesty , however , is that none of it is ever for show			2
he does it because he can but also because it works , because it wins matches			0
at times here he made the @entity93 champions look like a desperate , disparate bunch			0
if this is to be @entity97 ’s final act in @entity15 as manager of @entity36 then he will leave with @entity5 ’s scampering image burned on to the back of his eyes			1
@entity58 approaches @entity4 star @entity5 during their @entity32 tie on wednesday @entity5 slips the ball through @entity36 midfielder @entity58 's legs at the @entity13 @entity58 slides as @entity5 nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their @entity32 match @entity58 is left on his backside as @entity5 runs away from the @entity109 international with the ball @entity18 manager @entity2 ( centre ) reacts to the ridiculous skill from @entity5 during the match a ‘ nutmeg ’ is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent ’s legs , and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick			1
the origins of the word have long been debated , with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by countdown star @entity130 , of @entity131 , who tweeted : ‘ nutmegging in football comes from the centuries - old slang ‘ nutmegs ’ , meaning ‘ testicles ’			2
in case @entity5 is ever interested			1
’ however , the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in @entity142 rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation , while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between @entity147 and @entity109 in the 18th century , when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the @entity153			2
being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster			0
it later caught on in football , implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked , or , nutmegged			0
in @entity166 , the skill is known as ‘ cano ’ or ‘ tunel ’			0
they ’ve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the @entity13 thanks to @entity5			1
when @entity36 look back on the goal that effectively ended this tie , they will ask questions			1
was @entity176 right to track @entity177 all the way infield , allowing scorer @entity180 to proceed unimpeded from deep ? if @entity176 was not at fault then who was supposed to be tracking the runners ? for the visiting team the tactical debrief will not be pleasant			0
there was a poverty about their football at times			0
here in @entity191 , however , the locals will have taken home only memories of the way that @entity5 drifted infield from the right , dragging @entity36 defenders towards him like moths before lifting the perfect pass in to @entity180 ’s path			1
this is what the really great players do			0
they create panic and prompt rash decisions			0
they do , as much as is humanly possible in a sport involving 22 players , win games all on their own			0
not long after @entity4 ’s goal , @entity5 did pretty much the same thing again			1
this time he got a lucky bounce off his own face as he moved forwards but once again the chipped pass was perfect			0
once again @entity176 was distracted by the darting @entity177 but this time , somehow , there was no goal			0
it was to become a pattern			0
@entity36 did n’t help themselves			1
@entity68 began dreadfully and hardly improved			0
@entity69 looked paralysed – perhaps he was just too aware of what his international team - mate can do – while @entity36 ’s central midfield players failed palpably once again to locate the @entity4 midfield players queuing up to adorn @entity5 ’s creative work			1
at times they resorted to simply fouling @entity5			2
even @entity35 retreated back to his own 18 - yard line to crudely halt his passage towards goal			2
that , in its own way , was one of the night ’s most telling images			0
@entity5 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity69 ( left ) and @entity35 at full - time at the @entity13 @entity5 looks to break through as he terrorises the @entity36 defence on wednesday @entity5 shoots towards goal but his effort is saved by @entity36 goalkeeper @entity45 ( right ) @entity180 ( left ) scores the only goal of the game past @entity45 as @entity4 run out 1 - 0 winners @entity5 congratulates team - mate @entity180 on scoring the opener at the @entity13 on wednesday @entity246 and violence , though , will never distract @entity5			1
that is one of the many traits he shares with his great rival in @entity252 , @entity253			0
in to the second half and his appetite indeed remained strong			0
he touched the ball three times within ten seconds of the restart and two minutes later drove a shot towards goal that @entity45 beat away			2
at the death @entity45 denied him again at the end of a 70 - yard thrust that @entity5 began and almost finished			1
the @entity36 goalkeeper got the better of @entity5 at the end of the first leg , of course			1
he saved his penalty and @entity5 shovelled the rebound wide			2
maybe that memory drove him on wednesday night but it ’s doubtful			2
revenge is a motivation for the mortal			0
he ’s just a genius			0
@entity109 legend @entity276 settled the argument of who 's better between @entity5 and @entity253 former @entity280 player @entity279 wrote about @entity5 's nutmegs : ' again and again and again ... ' @entity283 's @entity282 was among those admiring the @entity4 star and wrote : ' @entity286 ' @entity288 striker @entity287 wrote that @entity2 's reaction said it all about @entity5 's skills @entity293 defender @entity292 wrote @entity5 could play against @entity36 on his own and ' still win the game ' @entity296 goalkeeper @entity295 echoed @entity297 by ' watching the game with my legs closed ' darts player @entity301 wrote on @entity302 that ' @entity5 could nutmeg a mermaid ' former @entity283 and now - @entity304 forward @entity305 added : ' @entity5 is a joke '			1

@entity2 looked surprised by the @entity5 show on wednesday
@entity4 beat @entity36 1 - 0 to progress to the quarter - finals of the @entity32
@entity5 's nutmeg on @entity58 provoked a memorable @entity2 reaction
