by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 01:34 est , 1 june 2012 @entity2 , i am delighted to say , has made it to the ball			1
just six weeks ago , @entity5 looked a dilapidated sight on her @entity8 mooring			1
few passers - by would have noticed the little brass plate commemorating her heroic part in the greatest rescue operation in @entity16 history – @entity17			1
in that sorry state , she was never going to make it to the greatest maritime party in several centuries – sunday ’s @entity23 on the @entity24			1
she 's arrived : the ' @entity25 , which saved 3000 lives in the @entity17 evacuation arrives in @entity28 to join the 1,000 crafts taking part in the jubilee pageant ahoy there : the @entity5 's crew waves to the shore as she sets sail ready to join the @entity36 but thanks to the generosity of @entity40 readers , she is seaworthy again			1
better still , she has made it to @entity28 for the first time in her 82 - year existence			1
yesterday , to whoops of delight from her devoted skipper and crew , she came chugging under @entity48 and on past some of the capital ’s most famous landmarks			1
and , come sunday , she will be part of the 50 - strong @entity17 contingent enjoying pride of place behind the @entity55 in that historic fleet of 1,000 craft			1
there is a real buzz building on the banks of the @entity24 where this friendliest of armadas has started arriving from all over the world			1
many of @entity28 ’s docks have been turned into temporary accommodation for the smaller craft			2
yesterday , beneath the shiny skyscrapers of @entity70 , i found a fleet of historic boats moored up , including several @entity73			2
most are in excellent condition but i still saw many owners in boiler suits , crawling over their engines just to make sure that nothing goes wrong cometh their greatest moment since 1940			2
proud history : the @entity5 makes her way under @entity48 for the first time in her 82 - year existence plucky : dwarfed in between a @entity88 vessel and the @entity90 19th century barque @entity91 continues her journey up the @entity24 one of these boats , @entity94 , made two round trips to the carnage of @entity17 , bringing back a cargo of @entity16 troops on the first run and @entity90 troops on the second			2
her pageant crew will include @entity103 , 72 , who was a schoolboy chorister at the @entity104 in 1953			2
‘ it ’s all going to be stunning			0
no one does this sort of thing better , ’ he said yesterday , proudly producing the @entity105 he was awarded for his boyhood service to the @entity107			0
last night , @entity5 was the latest arrival to this makeshift village in @entity114			0
her owner and skipper , @entity119 engineer @entity118 , was at pains to point out that his boat would never have got to @entity28 had @entity40 readers not heard of her plight last month and responded in their droves			1
‘ i want to thank every one of them , ’ he said			0
full ahead : the @entity5 chugs along proudly			0
she was carefully restored by skipper @entity128 thanks to the generosity of @entity40 readers pride of place : the 54ft craft had never ventured much beyond the @entity8 coast around @entity134 when she was summoned to @entity17 in may 1940 the 54ft new @entity91 had never ventured much beyond the @entity8 coast around @entity134 when she was summoned to @entity17 in may 1940			1
her owner , @entity136 , sailed to @entity90 with his 15 - year - old son , @entity137 , who is believed to have been the youngest participant in the great evacuation			0
that one small boat is believed to have plucked 3,000 men from the beaches and delivered them safely to waiting warships			0
neither @entity136 nor @entity137 ever spoke much about their experience afterwards and both men have since passed away			0
but , yesterday , @entity137 ’s nephew , @entity147 , 61 , was on board for the 12 - hour voyage to @entity28			0
what did it mean to see @entity5 prepare to take her place in front of the @entity55 ? ‘ it brings a tear to the eye , ’ he said			0
come sunday afternoon , he wo n’t be the only one			0
heyday : the @entity5 is believed to have plucked 3,000 men from the beaches and delivered them safely to waiting warships .			0

seaworthy again thanks to the generosity of @entity40 readers
