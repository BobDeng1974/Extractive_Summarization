a balloon carrying sensors designed to detect the faint traces left by alien life on other planets has been sent on a mission high into the @entity7 's atmosphere			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) spent more than an hour at 105,000 feet above the @entity7 's surface taking measurements before parachuting safely back to the ground			1
the experimental sensor , developed by researchers at @entity14 and the @entity15 , was being tested ahead of plans to send the device to other planets			1
the high altitude balloon above carried the new highly sensitive instrument 19.8 miles into the atmosphere capable of detecting traces of gas at parts per trillion - far more sensitive from current technologies - it could reveal the existence of life on other planets			1
even low levels of methane on a planet could indicate that there is life there breaking down organic material			2
the @entity8 sensor is launched into the air beneath a high - altitude balloon from @entity40 , @entity41 professor @entity42 , a physicist at the @entity15 who is leading the project , said : ' our sensor has the potential to detect specific gases at extremely low concentrations			1
' metabolic byproducts of life include characteristic gases like methane , which on @entity53 would be a very low concentrations			1
' professor @entity42 and his team launched their sensor , which uses an infrared laser the size of a grain of salt , on a high altitude balloon from @entity40 , @entity41 , on sunday			0
the toaster - sized device uses a technique known as ' intracavity laser absorption spectrometry ' to detect small amounts of gas			1
most atmospheric probes used to day are unable to measure the concentration of trace vapours or gases			0
however , @entity14 hopes that by using the @entity8 they may be able to detect small amounts of methane on other worlds like @entity53 , @entity75 's @entity74 and @entity78 's moon @entity76			1
low levels of methane have already been detected on @entity53 with hot spots where levels are thought to spike			2
scientists now want to explore these more closely in the hope that here may still be life existing somewhere beneath the surface			2
the test on the balloon was designed to show that the @entity8 could function in the extreme cold and low pressures of near space			2
in the stratosphere temperatures fall as low as @entity93 ( -59 ° c )			0
scientists claim to have discovered evidence that suggests there may be alien life living high up in our own atmosphere			0
researchers from the @entity101 and @entity102 claim to have gathered samples that show microscopic organisms are living 16 miles up in the stratosphere			0
using a high - altitude balloon , they gathered samples of dust and other microscopic debris high above the @entity7 's surface and say they found fragments of single celled algae known as a diatom			1
they argue that this could be the first evidence to show how life may have arrived on @entity7 from space , perhaps carried here by meteorites			2
it is not the first time organisms have been found in the atmosphere and indeed the skies are thought to be teeming with microscopic life			0
scientists working with @entity14 found 314 different types of bacteria living in the atmosphere up to five miles above the @entity130 and the @entity131 in 2012			2
they concluded the bacteria , which accounted for 20 per cent of the particles they collected , were carried up into the atmosphere by wind currents			0
however the team believe the device could also have applications on @entity7 to help monitor changes in the ozone layer as well as helping to detect traces of gas in breath tests to help diagnose disease			1
professor @entity42 said : ' the flight was very successful			0
the balloon reached 105,000 ft for over one hour , achieving objectives			0
' the instrument parachuted safely back to earth and i was able to join the recovery team			0
' our instrument functioned , and a first look at the data show expected types of numbers			0
it will take a while to analyze all of the data			0
' the @entity8 , shown above sitting on top of laboratory equipment being used to calibrate the device , is about the size of a domestic toaster and can detect minute traces of gases			1

@entity8 can detect tiny traces of gas
it can detect just one molecule of methane among a trillion other molecules
toaster - sized instrument flew 19.8 miles above @entity7 's surface in first test
it spent an hour at 105,000 feet collecting data before parachuting to @entity7
@entity14 hope to send it to @entity53 and other planets to search for signs of life
