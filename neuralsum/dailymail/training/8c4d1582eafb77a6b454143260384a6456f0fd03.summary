president @entity2 has a veto pen , and he will use it to block @entity5 - passed legislation if necessary , @entity1 press secretary @entity0 said on thursday			1
but , @entity0 , said , @entity2 would rather work with @entity5 instead of against them			1
' so if that means another round of golf with speaker [ john ] boehner ...			0
then he 's willing to do that			0
if it means sittin ' down at the table and enjoying some @entity15 bourbon with @entity16 , if that 's going to advance our ability to find common ground among ' he said , then @entity2 's willing to do that , too			1
@entity1 press secretary @entity0 said @entity2 would rather work with @entity5 instead of against them			1
' so if that means another round of golf with speaker [ john ] boehner ...			0
then he 's willing to do that			0
if it means sittin ' down at the table and enjoying some @entity15 bourbon with @entity16 ' then @entity2 's willing to do that , too			1
@entity0 's suggestion that @entity2 may bond with @entity31 over bourbon was in reference to a comment the president made on wednesday during press conference			1
in response to a question from a reporter , @entity2 said he ' would enjoy having some @entity15 bourbon ' with the @entity5 leader as a show of good faith			1
the joke harkens back to the 2013 @entity45			2
at the annul roast @entity2 told the audience , in jest , ' why do n’t you get a drink with @entity16 ! ' the dis was in response to critics of the president who had said he he needed to extend a hand across the aisle to the opposition			1
@entity31 responded to the jab by posting a picture of himself with a beer at a bar sitting next to an empty chair and a glass of red wine			2
at yesterday 's presser , in which @entity2 addressed the @entity5 gains in the @entity1 and @entity70 , @entity72 ' @entity71 reminded the president of the dig , at which point @entity2 said he 'd welcome a drink with @entity31			1
' i do n’t know what his preferred drink is , ' @entity2 said to laughter , adding that @entity31 ' has always been very straightforward ' with him			1
' to his credit , he has never made a promise that he could n’t deliver , ' @entity2 admitted			2
' and he knows the legislative process well			0
he obviously knows his caucus well -- he has always given me , i think , realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he ca n’t			0
' and so i think we can have a productive relationship			0
' @entity2 seemed open on wednesday to engaging the @entity5 leaders through less combative means than has typically been employed by both political parties since @entity5 took control of the @entity1 in 2011			1
' if the ways that we ’re approaching the @entity5 in @entity97 is n’t working , i ’m going to try different things - whether it ’s having a drink with @entity16 or letting @entity101 beat me again at golf , or weekly press conferences , ' he said			1
' i do n’t know if that would be effective , ' he added amid laughter from the press corp. since @entity2 's press conference yesterday @entity31 and @entity101 came out with a list of @entity5 sponsored legislation they 'd like to see approved by @entity97 and sent to the president 's desk next year			1
among those were bills that would gut @entity115 , the president 's legacy - making law			0
when @entity5 take a majority of both chambers beginning in january they will have enough votes to pass legislation repealing the health care reform act , forcing @entity2 to wet his ink straight out of the gate			1
' the president does have a pen on his desk			0
i ’m confident that he ’ll be in a position , where he ’ll have to veto some legislation where @entity131 and @entity5 are not able to find some common ground , ' @entity0 warned on thursday in an interview on @entity134 show @entity135			1
' the president 's eager , however , to actually sign pieces of legislation that have strong bipartisan support			0
' the bourbon bonding joke harkens back to the 2013 @entity45			1
at the annul roast @entity2 said in jest , ' why do n’t you get a drink with @entity16 ! ' while referencing criticisms that he had n't tried hard enough to find common ground with the @entity5 leader @entity31 responded to the dig by posting this picture of himself sitting in a @entity15 bar with a beer next to an empty chair and a glass of wine on twitter in an interview at @entity158 on thursday morning @entity0 said the president is fully aware that he and @entity5 leadership are not ' gon na to agree on everything			1
' ' there are things that the president 's gon na do that @entity5 wo n't agree with			2
there are bills that republicans are gon na pass that the president does n't agree with , ' he said			0
' the question really is , are we gon na to focus on the disagreements , or are we gon na to focus on those areas ' where @entity5 and @entity131 can work together			0
policy disagreements are no ' excuse ' not to work together to make the country better , @entity0 told reporters during his daily briefing on thursday			2
finding middle ground will be the ' focal point ' of the @entity1 in the weeks and months ahead and the topic of ' ongoing ' conversations with @entity184 leaders , starting with a bipartisan luncheon at the @entity1 tomorrow , he on thursday			0
playfully asked on @entity134 if @entity31 and @entity2 would finally grab that bourbon together during tomorrow 's meeting , @entity0 said , ' i think tomorrow will be focused on business			1
i do n't know that there will be a lot of drinking			0
' at the meeting @entity2 and congressional leadership will also discuss a request the president put forward for additional funding to fight @entity198			0
if the president and @entity31 do ' share a glass of bourbon , ' he said , it will be in a private setting , not a public one , like tomorrow 's meeting			2
@entity0 told @entity72 reporter @entity71 today that a date has not been set for the get - together ' but stay tuned			0
' ' i think the fact of the matter is the president is interested in trying to build some relationships with members of @entity97 to try to advance some of these priorities , ' @entity0 said thursday morning when he was asked about the anticipated bourbon summit while on @entity158			2
let 's be clear , though , he said , voters ' are n't just looking for the president to sit down and have a drink with @entity16 and play a round of golf with speaker @entity221 actually want results			2
' and if there are things that the president can do differently , he said , to make sure that we 're getting results for middle class families for the @entity230 people , then he 's willing to change his tactics to do exactly that , ' @entity0 said			0
at his briefing today with reporters @entity0 struck a similar tone			0
it 's not as if ' an extra cocktail party or another round of golf would have substantially changed the outcome ' of the last few years , he said			0
' but what will substantially change the outcome is a re-dedication on the part of this administration ' to work with @entity5 , he said , and ' a different political calculation ' by the @entity5 that would make them more inclined to work with the president to put into law legislation that both sides agree on .			2

@entity2 has a veto pen , and he will use it to block @entity5 - passed legislation if necessary , @entity0 said on thursday
but @entity2 would rather work to find ' common ground ' with @entity5 than fight with them
' if it means sittin ' down at the table and enjoying some @entity15 bourbon with @entity16 ' then @entity2 's willing to do that , @entity0 said
@entity2 said wednesday he 'd have a drink with @entity31 if the @entity5 leader wanted to ; joke goes back to jab @entity2 made at the senator in 2013
