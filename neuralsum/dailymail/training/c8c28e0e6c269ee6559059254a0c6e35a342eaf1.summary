the @entity20 said that the @entity21 of @entity2 , a species related to these black rhinos , is officially extinct according to the @entity8 , @entity2 's northern white rhino is ' teetering on the brink of extinction ' while @entity28 's @entity27 rhino is ' making its last stand ' the subspecies of the @entity26 - which is classified as ' critically endangered ' by the @entity8 's ( @entity8 ) @entity32 - was last seen in western @entity2 in 2006 , @entity30 reported			1
@entity33 , chairman of the @entity8 species survival commission , said : ' in the case of the western black rhino and the northern white rhino the situation could have had very different results if the suggested conservation measures had been implemented			1
' ' these measures must be strengthened now , specifically managing habitats in order to improve performance , preventing other rhinos from fading into extinction , ' mr @entity33 added			0
the western black rhino was a rare subspecias of the @entity26 , and was heavily hunted in the beginning of the 20th century			1
the population rose again in the 1930s , after preservation actions were taken , but a decline in protection efforts led to a decline in numbers			0
a javan rhino captured on camera in @entity59 's @entity58 , the last @entity60 in @entity59 was found dead in the park in april 2010 by 1980 the population was estimated in the hundreds and , by 2000 , an estimated 10 survived			0

they are the last known living members of the species , with none in captivity			0
the @entity80 , which is ' teetering on the brink of extinction ' , according to the @entity8 @entity59 's @entity27 rhino population had been shrinking for decades as land conversion and a rising local population threatened the animal 's habitat			1
the @entity8 says conservation efforts have paid off for the southern white rhino subspecies which have seen populations rise from less than 100 at the end of the 19th century to an estimated wild population of 20,000 today			1
another success can be seen with the @entity94 which was listed as ' extinct in the wild ' in 1996 but now , thanks to a captive breeding program , has an estimated population of 300			0
the latest update to the @entity32 reviews more than 60,000 species , concluding that 25 per cent of mammals on the list are at risk of extinction			0
many plants are also under threat , say the @entity8			2
populations of @entity109 fir , a conifer which was once widespread throughout @entity109 and @entity59 , is being threatened by the expansion of intensive agriculture according to the @entity8			2
a type of yew tree ( taxus contorta ) found in @entity28 which is used to produce @entity116 ( a chemotherapy drug ) has been reclassified from ' vulnerable ' to ' endangered ' on the @entity32 , as has the @entity118 -- a palm tree found in the @entity120 islands -- which is at risk from fires and illegal harvesting of its kernels			0
recent studies of 79 tropical plants in the @entity129 archipelago revealed that more than three quarters of them were at risk of extinction			0
in the oceans , the @entity8 reports that five out of eight tuna species are now ' threatened ' or ' near threatened , ' while 26 recently - discovered amphibians have been added to the @entity32 including the ' blessed poison frog ' ( classified as vulnerable ) while the ' summers ' poison frog ' is endangered			2
' this update offers both good and bad news on the status of many species around the world , ' @entity139 , director of @entity8 's global species program said in a statement			2
' we have the knowledge that conservation works if executed in a timely manner , yet , without strong political will in combination with targeted efforts and resources , the wonders of nature and the services it provides can be lost forever			2
