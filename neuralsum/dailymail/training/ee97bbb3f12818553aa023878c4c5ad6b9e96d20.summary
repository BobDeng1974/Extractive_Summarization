by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the message radiating from @entity3 is clear : @entity4 are a team transformed			1
as they look to banish last year to a box marked ‘ honest mistakes ’ , @entity4 - under the management of @entity8 - go into the new @entity9 season refreshed , full of new ideas and with a considerable amount of renewed optimism conspicuous by its absence for a club that spent more than £ 110million on replacing @entity15			1
the plan had been to reinvest the world - record fee on building a formidable squad , not reliant on one asset			2
in the end that hastily assembled group appeared lethargic under @entity22 and scattered with @entity23 in charge			2
a sense of direction was n't all that evident , @entity4 did n’t know who they were any more			1
from a relative nobody to one of the country ’s most revered coaches in under 18 months , the @entity34 has n’t messed about this pre-season			2
the squad have been made to work harder than ever before with an emphasis on a high octane programme ensuring they can press higher and for longer			2
players are comfortable with , even encouraging , the intensity training ; while a change in formation and style will be noticeable in the coming weeks - not least at @entity49 on saturday - it is the mood around the camp that has people at @entity4 wired			1
@entity52 is one of those enthusiasts			1
a club ambassador and under 18 coach , the former captain told @entity57 the tangible effects @entity8 - aided by @entity59 and @entity60 , who were both coaches at @entity62 - has had on an ailing group			1
‘ the manager has come in and is doing something that most of the players have never done before , ’ @entity52 said			1
‘ i 've been impressed			2
speaking to the players it ’s obvious pre-season has been tough but enjoyable			1
happy days : @entity8 has brought the smiles back to the faces of the @entity4 players ‘ they can see where the manager wants to go with this			1
it ’s not just hard work for the sake of hard work - it has a motive behind it			0
they can see why they ’re going to have to be fit			0
we need pace and fit players to get around the pitch to play at a high tempo			0
‘ last season we were guilty of not playing at the tempo we 've been used to			2
that ’ll come back this season			2
’ and here comes the real crucial item of information : ‘ the lads are happy			0
’ that has n't always been the case since @entity100 was sacked two years ago , and it ’s something that needed to be addressed quickly this summer			0
under @entity22 there had been more than a whiff of dressing - room dissent			0
his predecessor decided to play out spats in public			0
a united front it was not			0
@entity52 can be a tricky individual to read , but his body language when talking about @entity8 is expressive			1
there is a new philosophy afoot with largely the same squad , a desire to go and emulate @entity115 under @entity116			0
why not ? there is a squad in place , particularly after much - needed additions at the back , that can go and surprise			0
role model : @entity52 was appointed as an ambassador for @entity4 after hanging up his boots the 33 - year - old name checks @entity128 as someone who has the potential to unlock defences in a new system and an inventor able to ‘ flourish ’ when given licence			1
but @entity128 is the intriguing case			1
a poster boy for ill - informed decisions in the transfer market , it had looked like his stay in @entity141 would be brief			0
@entity22 was too rigid a coach to fully incorporate the @entity34 and by the time @entity23 rocked up the dye seemed to have already been cast			0
signed for close to £ 26million last august , @entity128 needed time to settle , time to stamp a mark on @entity141 football			1
people within the club truly believe he will thrive under @entity8			1
@entity128 has now been given that time , something not afforded to managers in north @entity150 very often			1
that ’s the main criticism levelled at @entity152 , who seems incapable of giving managers the lengthy stint they require			0
they 've gone through eight in 13 years			0
that impatience , says @entity52 , is merely borne out of a desire to get things right			1
@entity8 has a five - year contract and is seen as a long - term appointment			1
although the initial noises were the same with @entity22 , it appears the new man will be given a proper go			0
redemption : @entity128 has yet to live up to his £ 30million price tag after joining @entity4 last summer ‘ the chairman has done a great job over the years , ’ @entity52 added			1
‘ from where we were when i was breaking through to the end of my career has a lot to do with the chairman			0
he ’s driving and trying to make us a top team			0
‘ we 've obviously had a lot of changes but that ’s through a chairman who is passionate and wants the team to do well			0
’ @entity52 has a very valid point			1
the year he made his debut - 1999 - @entity4 finished in the bottom half			1
fifteen later that ’s unthinkable			0
‘ hopefully we ’ll go on and win the league in the next few years , ’ the club legend said			0
that ’s the power of @entity8			2
@entity188 happy with players @entity52 is an ambassador for @entity190			2
during the 2014/15 season , @entity190 will be saying thank you to all those people who champion the true spirit of the game			2
join the conversation at @entity197			0

@entity8 has already made an impact at @entity4
pre-season training has been tough but enjoyable
