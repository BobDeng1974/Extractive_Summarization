by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 08:11 est , 1 november 2012 an army veteran and his daughter are finally back together 21 years after his @entity4 wife had sent her to a foster home while he was in @entity6			1
@entity7 , 22 , is now with father @entity8 and his new wife @entity9 at their home in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the pair met for the first time in over two decades in july but it was not until october that @entity17 could secure a visa to live in @entity19			1
gulf war : @entity21 ( not pictured ) was activated for @entity22 and while he was gone his wife left him and sent their daughter to live with foster parents @entity8 , 48 , now a correctional officer , had been stationed in @entity4 during the first @entity22 , when he had @entity7 , before he was activated for @entity22 in @entity6			1
but when he returned his wife had moved away and @entity7 had been given to foster carers			1
in 1999 @entity8 was moved back to the @entity19 - but he did not stop searching for his daughter even though the only thing he had to remember her by was an old photo			1
@entity7 was taken back by her mother but then given up three more times to foster parents over the years			1
' when i came back to @entity4 she was gone , ' @entity8 told the @entity35			2
' i did n't know where she was , ' he said			2
' ( @entity7 's ) mother just ( disappeared )			1
she would n't talk to me - they said i 'm an @entity19 soldier , she 's @entity4 - so i had no rights			1
' he continued : ' i would write ( my former wife ) and i would never hear anything - nothing , ' he said			1
' but my ( current ) wife , @entity9 , wrote her and she started answering back			1
i do n't know why she would talk to her and not me			2
' @entity8 and @entity9 tried to get @entity7 to visit them when she was 13 but her mother refused to let the girl come without her			1
the call was suddenly ended and communication between them was blocked off again			2
but @entity7 was still searching , knowing her father lived in @entity13 and earlier this year her maternal aunt and uncle helped her find details of a @entity21 in @entity12			1
she left a message at @entity55 in the spring where @entity8 picks up an iced coffee on the way to work at the @entity59			2
' a girl named @entity61 was working there , ' said @entity8			2
' i went in and she said " someone from @entity4 called here "			2
' but @entity61 lost the note and it was not until a week later that the cafe owner @entity67 found it			0
' a few days later i went by and she had the piece of paper , ' explained @entity8			0
' it said " daughter looking for you " - and then the phone number			0
' he continued : ' i did the easy thing and asked @entity9 to call			0
but she told me i had to call			0
' eventually he picked up the phone and spoke to his daughter			0
' i could n't believe i was talking to her , ' he said			0
they began speaking via email and eventually she flew out to @entity84 to meet him and @entity9 on july 13			0
' unbelievable , ' said @entity8			0
' twenty - one years later , i did n't think it was possible			0
' he is delighted with the young woman that she has become over the past two decades			0
' very proud - very , ' he said			0
' she makes a father happy			0
@entity8 continued : ' sometimes i look at her and i think she 's a little 12 - or 14 - year - old kid			0
other times she 's a grown woman			0
' @entity7 said : ' i 'm happy to stay here and i will come back as fast as i can			1
' it is a good feeling to know where i came from			0
my dad and @entity9 are nice people and i love them very much			0
i 'm happy to see them again			0
' she spent a week in the @entity19 before flying back home , determined to live in @entity19 permanently			1
@entity8 and @entity9 hired a lawyer to help them secure dual - citizenship and after a visa struggle they eventually sorted out the paperwork			2
' it makes me angry that we tried everything to come here and nobody helps you , ' @entity7 told the @entity116			1
' they said " there 's nothing we can do - it 's your problem , not ours			0
" but finally , i 'm here			0
' she bought a one - way ticket to the @entity19 and arrived on october 7			1
in the weeks since then she has spent time on the @entity7 ranch , assisting with work on cars , splitting wood , driving a tractor and even firing @entity8 's guns			1
@entity7 is not planning on staying at the ranch - she is currently looking for a job and house in @entity134			1
' the main thing is i have a job and earn some money to start , ' she explained			2

@entity21 left for @entity6 when his then wife moved away , leaving @entity7 , nearly one , with carers
@entity7 has now secured a visa to stay in @entity19 where she is looking for a job
