@entity0 last night urged @entity1 to shake off the spectre of the @entity4 war and back potentially years of @entity6 strikes against the ‘ psychopathic murderers ’ of @entity8			1
mps have been scrambled for an emergency recall of @entity11 tomorrow to sanction bombing raids on terrorist positions in northern @entity4			1
all three party leaders indicated support for air strikes , and the attacks are expected to begin as early as tomorrow night			1

mr @entity0 , who last night held talks with @entity4 prime minister @entity23 to finalise military plans , stressed that @entity1 troops would not be sent back to @entity4			1
in a speech to the @entity28 general assembly in @entity29 , mr @entity0 acknowledged the long shadow cast by the disastrous legacy of the @entity46 , which left the region in near anarchy - and , some say , sowed the seeds of the rise of @entity8			2
but he said it was vital to ' learn the right lessons - yes to careful preparation ; no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan '			2
mr @entity0 warned : ' we must not be so frozen with fear that we do n't do anything at all			1
' isolation and withdrawing from a problem like @entity62 will only make things worse			2
' we must not allow past mistakes to become an excuse for indifference or inaction			2
' action against @entity40 should be ' comprehensive , intelligent and inclusive ' , working with partners in the region , potentially including @entity71 - whose president @entity73 he met for historic talks at the @entity28			2
and he added : ' we should be uncompromising , using all the means at our disposal - including military force - to hunt down these extremists			2
' the struggle with extremism must be waged not only against @entity40 in @entity4 and @entity34 , but also against @entity83 in @entity37 , @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 in @entity36 and @entity87 in @entity35 , mr @entity0 said			1
while the threat would not be best solved by @entity91 ground troops ' directly trying to pacify or reconstruct @entity93 or @entity94 countries ' , there was a place for the military in training , advising and supporting humanitarian missions , as well as in responding to the @entity4 government 's request to the @entity28 for support			1
' my message today is simple , ' he told the @entity28			2
' we are facing an evil against which the whole world must unite			2
and , as ever in the cause of freedom , democracy and justice , @entity1 will play its part			2
' ahead of his speech he told reporters : ‘ this is completely different to 2003			2
everyone can see that @entity62 ( @entity40 ) is a direct threat to the @entity1			0
they have taken hostages , they have conducted plots to kill and maim @entity1 citizens			0
they are a clear and present danger to the @entity1			0
they are also clearly a massive danger to the region			0

six of the fighters are currently based in @entity131 @entity0 last night urged @entity1 to shake off the spectre of the @entity4 war and back @entity6 strikes against the ‘ psychopathic murderers ’ of @entity8 ‘ so this organisation is a direct threat			1
we need to be part of a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy it			0
it ’s right that @entity1 plays our part in that			0
‘ this is going to take time , there ’s no doubt about that , but it ’s right to be part of this action			0
the @entity4 government has requested it and we have capabilities that are needed for it and so it ’s the right thing to do			1
’ @entity40 has murdered three @entity91 hostages in recent weeks and is now threatening to kill kidnapped @entity1 taxi driver @entity156			0
some relatives of mr @entity156 have warned this week that air strikes could reduce the hopes of ever seeing him alive again			1
mr @entity0 acknowledged their plight , but insisted @entity1 now had to take the fight to @entity40			2

‘ one is that we are dealing with psychopathic murderous brutal people who will stop at nothing to carry out dreadful acts on these hostages			0
‘ and secondly , it ’s very important that we do the right thing as a country and we stick to the path that we set out about having a comprehensive strategy including all the elements at our disposal – humanitarian aid , diplomacy and also where appropriate military action			0
’ the prime minister said @entity1 would never give up the hunt for @entity205 , the @entity1 extremist thought to have beheaded three hostages			1
asked if he wanted him to face justice in a @entity1 court , a visibly angry mr @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m not sure i can describe in words what i ’d like to happen to him , but i ’m not going to say any more about it			0
he should see justice one way or another			0
’ he backed @entity216 and @entity218 air strikes against @entity40 in @entity34 but said @entity1 would not be joining in at this stage			1
the wife of @entity1 hostage @entity156 last night thanked wellwishers for their support as more than 150 people attended a multi-faith peace vigil in @entity226 to pray for his release			1
a statement from @entity229 was read to the crowd by her husband ’s friend @entity231 , who described the taxi driver as ‘ like a brother to me ’			0
it read : ‘ we are very grateful for your support and kind words at this difficult time			2
i ask you all to pray for @entity156 and all the other people unfairly imprisoned worldwide			0

labour leader @entity272 held an emergency meeting of his shadow cabinet at the party ’s annual conference in @entity277 , and spoke by telephone to the prime minister			1
he indicated that his party , which inflicted a humiliating defeat on mr @entity0 last year when it pulled its support for military strikes in @entity34 , is ready to back action in @entity4			1
but to the anger of some conservative mps , he said joining the @entity216 in hitting @entity34 , where @entity40 is thought to be holding mr @entity156 , would need to be approved by a @entity287 resolution – something that is politically impossible given the opposition of @entity290 and @entity291			1
@entity293 leader @entity292 said his party backed the air strikes because they were requested by the @entity4			1
mr @entity0 also held talks with @entity71 president @entity73 – the first face - to - face talks between the leaders of the two countries since the @entity71 revolution in 1979			2

@entity302 : ' the only language understood by killers like this is the language of force			0
