she enraged @entity2 users by saying that ' unhealthy lifestyles ' should not be ' facilitated ' , and now the plus - size industry has spoken out about @entity6 's comments on @entity7			1
critics and the public have spoken out after @entity6 said that obese women ' should feel uncomfortable ' about their unhealthy size , and that high street stores should not be catering for them			1
the panellist said she was ' hounded on @entity2 ' after airing her views on the @entity15 show in a discussion about overweight teenagers , and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20			1
she said : ' we come in all shapes and sizes and we all deserve to enjoy shopping for clothes whether we are a size zero or a size 20 plus			2
it is such a shame that @entity6 has used her privileged position of influence to encourage people to feel ashamed of themselves			0
' the thought that a person should be made to feel excluded from having access to lovely clothes is absurd and trying to link clothes size to health is also uninformed			2
' our ethos at @entity29 in @entity30 is to make women look and feel great about their bodies and give women more choice and access to great quality premium denim			2

' @entity98 , who set up @entity99 , told @entity100 she did so because she ' does n't believe in ignoring bullies '			0
' the whole point of the hashtag is not health or weight			0
people 's health is their own business and if someone chooses to be plus size and healthy or unhealthy that is up to them			2
the idea behind the hashtag is that even if people are unhealthy , they have a right to buy clothing without being made to feel uncomfortable			2
' @entity6 called for a large spectrum of people being made to feel uncomfortable just because they could be unhealthy and that will never be acceptable to me or the other people using the @entity125 tag			2

' so i do feel like @entity6 has been somewhat unfairly picked on			1

' i did n’t make it clear on the show that i was talking about extremes , i was talking about above size 20 and below size six , those sizes being available en masse , ' she said			0
