by @entity0 and @entity1 authorities say a pair of deer on the @entity5 snarled traffic in and out of @entity7 during the evening commute			1

' not a big deal			0
just some deer running down the @entity43 on the @entity5 , ' joked @entity44 on @entity37			2
@entity9 officer @entity45 tells the @entity10 that it 's not uncommon for calls about ' animal hazards ' to work themselves out before the officers arrive because animals do n't like traffic any more than humans do			2
@entity53 reports that the deer seemed entered the bridge from the south , according to @entity9 officer @entity57			0
the deer forced three northbound traffic lanes to a halt as they scampered all the way from @entity7 toward @entity14			1
' they pretty much created their own traffic break , ' @entity63 said			0
' that could be what saved the deer from getting hurt ... if it was lighter traffic the cars would have been moving faster , ' he added			1
this is n't the first time that animals have been spotted on the @entity5 but this is the first time it 's happened during his two years as serving as a public information officer			0
despite the commotion , the deer got off the bridge safe and sound and the drivers were able to put their hooves on the gas pedal once again though they were still stuck in traffic			2

@entity103 held up three lanes of traffic as they scampered on the @entity5 from @entity7 towards @entity14 at about 5:30 p.m.
the deer briefly halted the evening commute as drivers slowed to give them space
by 6 p.m. , the officers on the way to the scene were called off because the deer were no longer in the road
no deer nor humans were injured
heavy traffic kept the deers from getting hurt *due* to slower pace of cars
