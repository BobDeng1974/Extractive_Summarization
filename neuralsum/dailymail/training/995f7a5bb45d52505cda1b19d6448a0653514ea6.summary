@entity12 player @entity11 flipped the bird when he became the focus of kiss cam - which zooms in on couples in the crowd with the aim of getting them to pucker up for the @entity20			0
the far from romantic gesture came as the camera operator singled out 6ft 4ins @entity11 and his teammate @entity23			2
pucker up : @entity11 , left , and @entity23 appear on kiss cam just moments before the rude gesture that 's the spirit : a couple happily show @entity11 how kiss cam should be done in front of 17,000 fans it has prompted @entity2 bosses to fine @entity11 $ 25k but the punishment will hardly dent the 30 - year - old 's $ 854,389 salary			1
the kiss cam is a fans favourite at @entity2 arenas across the @entity39 but can lead to awkward situations , with relatives sometimes having to plead with the camera crew to move on to their next target			1
it is not unusual for players to become kiss cam fodder but they normally shrug it off with a chuckle , get into the spirit with a pretend kiss or just ignore it altogether			0
even @entity50 is not immune from kiss cam			0
earlier this year he sportingly kissed wife @entity52 when they flashed up on the big screen during an exhibition match between @entity39 and @entity56			1
slam dunk : @entity11 , left , shows his defensive skills against @entity60 ' @entity59 high earner : @entity11 was fined $ 25k it will hardly dent his $ 854,389 salary with @entity12 @entity11 was targeted in the fourth quarter of the @entity12 match against @entity60 ' at the @entity66 in @entity67 on friday - which they lost 95 - 94			1
he signed for @entity12 in the summer , a year after a $ 3m deal with the club fell through because @entity11 was diagnosed with heart problems			0
@entity11 has played for seven @entity2 teams , including @entity73 and @entity74 , in his 10 - year career but his trophy cabinet is empty			2
he has also struggled to replicate the form he showed during a spell at @entity79 from 2005 - 08			0
