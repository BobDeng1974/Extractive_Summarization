@entity0 has dismissed @entity2 curry as ' a craze ' with ' no authentic origin ' and predicted ' it will slowly die ' in this country it is one of @entity10 's most popular curries			1
but the popularity of the @entity2 may soon be over , according to one of the nation 's top food writers			1
@entity0 has dismissed the dish as ' a craze ' with ' no authentic origin ' and predicted ' it will slowly die ' in this country			1
@entity18 , who was born in @entity19 and became a household name with her @entity22 cookery shows in the 1980s , said @entity24 food in @entity10 was slowly getting better			1
and she said the @entity2 , which had ' origins in no place we would want to visit ' , would slowly die out as people moved on to other @entity24 dishes			1
the dish , which is thought to have been invented in a @entity32 curry house in 1977 , gained popularity in the @entity10 throughout the 1980s and 1990s			1
it recently appeared in a list of the top ten most popular curries by the @entity37			2
speaking yesterday at the @entity38 , @entity18 said it was an easy way to cook but was not the traditional @entity24 way			1
she said : ' i studied the @entity2 phenomenon quite a few years ago			1
around the 80s , i really studied the @entity2 and whether it had any authenticity or not			1
i think it was just a craze			2
' it was just a version of cooking in a wok and it was stir fried food			0
' the heat is so high that sauces get reduced very fast			0
it 's a style of cooking where you have pre-cooked or partially cooked meat sitting there , pressure cooked , and you make different sauces for that meat			0
that became known as @entity2 cooking			2
' i do n't think it has origins in any place we would want to visit			2
' @entity18 , who was speaking at the @entity38 , said @entity24 curries used to taste like ' mud ' but that technique was slowly improving			1
she added of the @entity2 : ' i do n't think it has origins in any place we would want to visit			1
i think it just grew up in @entity32 , then @entity73 , then a lot of places around there			2
' i think it will slowly die			1
people like it , they obviously get a kick out of it			2
but i do n't think it has authentic origins			1
' @entity18 , 81 , who was awarded @entity84 in 2004 , first came to the @entity10 to study at the @entity85 , from which she graduated in 1957			2
she appeared on a number of cookery programmes including @entity0 's @entity88 in 1982 , @entity0 's @entity89 in 1989 and @entity0 's @entity90 in 1995			2
balti curry is thought to have been invented in a @entity32 restaurant in 1977 and gained popularity in the @entity10 throughout the 1980s and 1990s yesterday , she said she had decided to leave @entity94 because of the ' inequality ' women faced in the home			1
and she hit out at sexism in the restaurateur business , saying women had been held back from being chefs because of societal constraints			0
she said : ' my grandmother and mother ran kitchens for 30 people , 40 people			0
and they were large households that they ran and they ran them with great efficiency and great care and cleanliness and all the rest of it			0
' they did n't need to be told by a man that only men can do the job			0
men step in and take away the job when there 's money to be made			0
' and when you look at the history of chefs , it 's men – because for example in a country like @entity94 women were n't allowed to go out and mix with the men			0
there 's all kinds of other reasons that kept them back – not their abilities			0
' any woman can run a kitchen , she 's used to it for thousands of years			0
but it 's where the men allow women , it 's the women 's place in society , i think all that has been the problem			0
' she also advocated teaching more multicultural dishes in schools , to enable children to learn about other cultures			0
she said : ' they 're not only learning each other 's cultures but they learn how to cook each other 's food			0
' that is a wonderful way that schools can teach people about other cultures , and bring food in as a method of learning , which i think in schools is absolutely wonderful			0
