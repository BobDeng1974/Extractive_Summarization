have an idea for an unusual trip but do n’t have the funds to pay for it ? this could be the site for you			2

@entity14 , the ceo of @entity15 , said he wants to make travel more accessible and use crowdfunding as the means to make the dreams come true			1
@entity15 the crowd - funding site			1
you , too , can get other people to pay for your trip of a lifetime ‘ the idea is to make travels more accessible to people			2
it ’s not a secret that most people do n’t travel because it ’s expensive , ’ he said			0
‘ at @entity15 we allow people to raise funds for their travels using crowdfunding and sponsorships			1
friends , family , inspired people can back the trip and make it a reality			0
’ and while some seem a little self - indulgent – taking a trip on @entity45 – and others appear a little overly optimistic – feeding the homeless in ten @entity49 countries – there are many worthwhile projects that people are trying to raise funds for			1
users have between 10 and 90 days to get their money but any cash you do raise , you get to keep ( unlike other crowdfunding sites ) although @entity15 will keep 5 per cent plus @entity59 will take another 3.9 per cent			1
not getting his kicks : one @entity15 user wanted $ 10,000 to make a trip on @entity45			2
he only managed to raise $ 15 ‘ some travels are really inspirational and travellers go on a journey not for themselves , but for other people – volunteering , charity , etc , ’ said @entity14			0
‘ mostly travels are not about destination , it ’s about the process , about the impact and about making a difference either on your life or in someone else ’s			0
‘ today technology allows us to raise funds for all of that and more – connect with people and tell your story			1

the company is earning money but @entity14 knows that he has a tough journey ahead of him			0
‘ we will always stick to our vision – to make travels cheaper and accessible to everyone , so unless we find some gold mine , we will stick to finding the ways to increase our success stories , ’ he said			2
‘ even after finding gold in a mine we ’re still probably going to fund some trips with it			0
because nothing that you buy actually makes you richer – only travels			0
