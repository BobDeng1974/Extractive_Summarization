@entity0 may be better known for its smartphones , but the @entity3 company today revealed it plans to enter the camera market			1
in what has been described as a direct challenger to the likes of action camera @entity8 and @entity11 's latest cubed device , @entity0 has launched its first standalone camera , dubbed re. the @entity14 device , which also records videos in 1080p hd , features a unique cylindrical design and remote viewfinder			1
the 16 megapixel re camera , which has a cmos sensor and 1080p hd video recording , features a unique cylindrical design a built - in grip sensor instantly activates the camera when its picked up , and its single shutter button allows one tap to capture photos , with a longer press being used for video recording			1
the design also has a 146 - degree wide - angle lens , as well as slow - motion and time - lapse recording , with a remote viewfinder that allows users to take shots through their mobiles			1
an app , available for both @entity39 and @entity40 , will automatically back everything stored on the camera to the user ’s phone or the cloud to free up space on the camera			0
in the future , @entity48 will offer real - time video streaming to @entity51 , allowing anyone to share events in their lives as they happen			1
a built - in grip sensor instantly activates the camera on pick up			1
its single shutter button allows one tap to capture photos and a longer press for video recording			0
pictured is the camera with its stand the periscope camera , called re , is curious - looking			2
it stands around four inches tall and the cylinder design means it ’s easy to grip and a hidden sensor means that as soon as you touch it , it ’s ready to go			2
the colour finishes look good and the re feels solid and classy , much more so that just looking at it might suggest			0
holding it is a strange experience at first , especially as you do n’t look at the back of it as you would a regular camera			0
in fact , it ’s more akin to the way @entity85 photographers would hold a flash aloft			0
because it has a wide - angle lens you do n’t need to have it in front of your face and it easily includes all that you ’re looking at , so there are no worries about framing your shot			0
the lens does mean there ’s a slight fish - eye lens effect			0
the trigger button , a large chrome button on the rear of the device , means there ’s no shutter lag and the simple way of shifting between stills and video ( short press for images , long press for video ) works well			0
still , it ’s light and small enough to hide in a pocket or bag easily			0
you can also trigger the shutter remotely from an @entity40 or @entity118 smartphone , which is handy			0
the four times slo - mo looks pristine , though the resolution is @entity121 , not full hd			0
the re is a different product even from the lens - style cameras @entity127 has launched			1
the initial results looked promising and it feels good in the hand			0
though whether the public is ready to embrace a hand - held periscope is anybody ’s guess @entity135 alongside its new camera , @entity0 also unveiled its latest @entity138 model , the @entity139			1
the smartphone has @entity142 front and rear - facing cameras , and three microphones to increase sound quality alongside its new camera , @entity0 also unveiled its latest @entity138 model , the @entity139			1
size : 3.8 - inch ( 96.7mm ) x 1 - inch ( 26.5 mm ) weight : 65.5g memory : @entity149 included connectivity : @entity151 ( @entity152 4.0 ) , @entity153 , micro-usb , 1/4 - inch tripod connection camera : 16mp , cmos sensor , 146 ° lens , 1080p , 30fps @entity160 video , 720p , 4x slow motion video , time - lapse video recording battery : 820 mah rechargeable battery ( 1,200 @entity14 photos ; 1 hour 40 min of continuous @entity160 video recording ) the smartphone has @entity142 front and rear - facing cameras , and three microphones to increase sound quality			1
back - illuminated sensors capture crisp photos , even in low - light conditions , and dual - led flash on both cameras means selfies are illuminated			0
@entity139 has a 5.2 - inch full hd display , waterproof casing , a @entity181 801 processor and @entity182			1
as well as hardware , the @entity183 has face - tracking capabilities that can follow four people in a room at the same time when using services such as @entity189			1
in direct competition with the @entity48 camera , @entity11 recently launched its cube device , a tiny action camera with a distinctive square design			1
it measures 1.5 inches ( 3.8cm ) on all sides and can capture high definition video at 1080 or 720p			0
in a similar format to @entity48 , still images can also be taken at a resolution of @entity200 with its one - button operation			2
three is the only @entity203 operator to offer the @entity204 and @entity205			0
the camera will also be available from @entity207 from november for £ 169.99			2
the @entity139 is a big phone ( thanks to its 5.2 - inch screen ) but feels comfortable enough in the hand			1
snapping selfies is straightforward and the front - facing camera was fast and responsive , even in lower light			2
the first thing you notice is a much bigger lens on the front of this phone than on any other , matched by the twin flash			0
@entity221 looked and sounded good thanks to full @entity160 resolution recording on both front and back cameras , and three microphones to pick up all the sound – this also promises better background noise cancellation for audio and video calls			2
the phone has @entity0 ’s trademark @entity233 twin speakers at top and bottom of the screen to enhance sound whether you ’re video - calling or playing back footage you ’ve shot			2
commenting on the news , @entity241 , chief of research at @entity243 said : ' the @entity205 ’s quirky design is certainly distinctive , but @entity0 is going to have to provide some compelling reasons to buy one given most people are already carrying a smartphone with a great camera			1
' @entity0 has doubtless had its head turned by the 3.8 million action cameras that @entity8 sold in 2013 but it is going to be a stretch to expect consumers to embrace the re camera as a compelling alternative for everyday action photography			2
the re camera has a 146 - degree wide - angle lens , as well as slow - motion and time - lapse recording , with a remote viewfinder that allows users to take shots through their mobiles in regards the @entity139 , @entity265 , mobiles expert at @entity267 , said : ' @entity0 has unleashed what can only be described as the ultimate selfie phone on the market right now			1
' no other mobile maker has yet added a whopping @entity142 camera to the front of a mass - market phone , so this handset could well feature under a few trees this year			0
' if priced right , the launch of the @entity139 could be @entity0 's smartest move yet - an affordable phone , with flagship features , targeted at a younger market - just as we head towards the present buying time of year			1
' in direct competition with the re camera and @entity8 ( right ) , @entity11 recently launched its @entity286 ( left ) , a tiny action camera with a distinctive square design			0
