@entity5 , 67 , known for tackling controversial topics with movies including @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11 , will base his film on the @entity13 , the book about the scandal by @entity17 journalist @entity16			1
it will tell the story of the @entity21 defence contractor who stole hundreds of thousands of documents exposing spying by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) and other state spy agencies , including @entity17 's @entity26			1
film director @entity5 , 67 , left , is to make a thriller about how @entity1 , 30 , leaked state secrets @entity24 executive @entity29 , who assessed the damage done by @entity1 's leaks , said the stolen files contained ' the keys to the kingdom ' , while @entity36 director @entity35 called it ' a gift to terrorists '			1
wanted by @entity21 authorities on spy charges punishable by 30 years in prison , @entity1 went on the run , and has now sought temporary asylum in @entity45			1
@entity5 , who will direct the film with @entity47 as producer , said : ' this is one of the greatest stories of our time			0
' the @entity1 scandal began a year ago when the 30 - year - old computer genius leaked details of attempts by government agencies to illegally view citizens ’ private information , claiming that people 's internet history , emails , text messages , calls and passwords had been harvested			1
the defence contractor , who had worked for the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) also made the highly damaging revelation that the @entity21 had hacked @entity72 computers , and the communications of allies such as @entity75 and @entity76			0
the computer specialist , who worked at an intelligence centre in @entity79 , tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in @entity21 history , on a par with @entity89 whistleblower @entity88			2
the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) headquarters in @entity91 : details of its spying programmes were leaked the leak began this time last year when he met @entity21 journalists @entity99 and @entity100 , telling them he had ' sensitive documents ' he would like to share			2
after handing over @entity24 documents , he revealed himself publicly as the source , before fleeing @entity21 justice to @entity45			1
@entity1 is now living there on a one - year temporary asylum , granted last august			0
some , including @entity5 , hailed @entity1 as a hero for lifting the lid on government surveillance			2
@entity5 said : ' he revealed secrets that we should all know , that the @entity21 has repeatedly violated the fourth amendment			0
' but many accused him of putting people 's lives at risks with his betrayal			1
@entity24 executive @entity29 , in charge of assessing the damage , said the stolen files contained ‘ the keys to the kingdom ’ , while @entity36 director general @entity35 called it a ‘ gift to terrorists ’			0
journalists from @entity17 newspaper the @entity127 , which reported the leaked documents , will be involved in the making of @entity5 's film , which they hope will not flop like @entity132 did , the 2013 film starring @entity134 based on @entity89 and its founder , @entity135			1
editor @entity136 said : ' the story of @entity1 is truly extraordinary , and the unprecedented revelations he brought to light have for ever transformed our understanding of , and relationship with , government and technology			0
' the film will start shooting before the end of the year			0
while @entity5 will have a host of @entity151 stars to choose from when casting for an actor to play @entity1 , he will have his work cut out for him choosing someone to portray @entity127 editor , @entity136			0
the privately educated 60 - year - old was criticised after he published documents leaked to his newspaper by @entity1 and then destroyed computer hard drives containing the information , rather than handing them over as requested by government authorities			2
@entity136 , who earns £ 395,000 as editor of the @entity127 , is said to be involved in the making of the film as a consultant , but is not expected to play himself in the movie			0
@entity166 , 53 , who is not known for his love of a free press , would be the flattering choice , while other - likely and less likely - candidates could include tousle - haired @entity171 , 48 , or even ( provided he shaved first ) , would - be journalist , @entity173 , 38			0
if @entity127 editor @entity136 , left , features in @entity5 's film , would @entity166 be picked to play him ? @entity175 - haired @entity171 , left , looks most like @entity136 , but @entity173 could be a left - field choice			2

@entity1 , 30 , leaked documents from state spy agencies including @entity26
former intelligence worker was accused of putting people 's lives at risk
after handing over classified papers to journalists , he fled the @entity21 to @entity45
@entity1 is wanted on spy charges which are punishable by 30 years ' jail
@entity5 , director of @entity9 , @entity11 , and @entity10 , is a *fan*
@entity17 and @entity21 spy chiefs have *condemned* him , but @entity5 says ' he 's a hero '
