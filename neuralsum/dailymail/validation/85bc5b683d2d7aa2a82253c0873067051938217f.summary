president @entity0 wasted little time monday night in blasting @entity3 @entity2 gov. @entity2 for a new state law that bans requiring the payment of union dues as a condition of employment , saying it ' will weaken , rather than strengthen workers			1
' @entity2 signed the bill into law on monday , making the @entity3 the 25th with such a ' @entity13 ' law			1
@entity3 gov. @entity2 signed the measure into law monday			1
@entity2 is expected to run as a @entity19 candidate for president in 2016			1
' hours later , he leveraged the issue in a fundraising email			0
' the @entity37 will never forgive me for taking away their power but we are doing the right thing , ' he wrote , asking for donations ranging from $ 10 to $ 1,000			0
by 9:00 at night , the @entity43 was circulating a statement from @entity0 claimign that @entity2 had notched a ' victory over working @entity46			1
' if the @entity3 governor were interested in protecting workers , the president said , be would be ' taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave			1
that ’s how you give hardworking middle - class families a fair shot in the new economy			0
' the nod to wages was a subtle jab at @entity3 for not embracing a @entity43 - led push to raise the minimum wage nationwide			1
the new @entity3 law , @entity0 claimed , is part of ' a sustained , coordinated assault on unions , led by powerful interests and their allies in government			1
' @entity3 is the first to enact a right - to - work law since @entity74 and @entity75 did it in 2012			1
the president issued this statement shortly after 9:00 p.m. on monday : ' it ’s no coincidence that the rise of the middle class in @entity46 coincided in large part with the rise of unions – workers who organized together for higher wages , better working conditions , and the benefits and protections that most workers take for granted today			2
so it ’s inexcusable that , over the past several years , just when middle - class families and workers need that kind of security the most , there ’s been a sustained , coordinated assault on unions , led by powerful interests and their allies in government			1
' so i ’m deeply disappointed that a new anti-worker law in @entity3 will weaken , rather than strengthen workers in the new economy			2
@entity3 is a state built by labor , with a proud pro-worker past			2
so even as its governor claims victory over working @entity46 , i ’d encourage him to try and score a victory for working @entity46 – by taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave			0
that ’s how you give hardworking middle - class families a fair shot in the new economy – not by stripping their rights in the workplace , but by offering them all the tools they need to get ahead			0
' opponents of the measure complain that the law will give companies the upper hand and drive down wages			0
proponents say laws that de-fang powerful unions can bring renewed business investment into a state , creating more jobs			2
@entity133 , president of the @entity134 , said the @entity3 law could bring a new wave of imitators in the @entity138 – historically strong industrialized regions with robust labor unions			1
' every worker deserves freedom of choice when it comes to union membership and dues payment , @entity133 said in a statement , ' and if states like @entity74 and @entity3 can pass right to work then @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 can too			2
' not all @entity3 residents are behind @entity2 , most notably labor union bosses and much of their rank - and - file			1
as legislators passed the new bill on feb. 28 , thousands of opponents braved sub-freezing temperatures to rally outside the state capitol in @entity160 , chanting union slogans and listening to speeches			0
it was a far cry from larger protests that engulfed the capital city in 2011 when he endorsed a plan to cut $ 1.5 billion of state spending by requiring unionized government workers to fund some of their own health benefits			0
the proposal , which he later signed into law , also gave school districts the power to hire and fire without regard for seniority , something opposed by teachers unions			0
getting that legislation to @entity2 's desk proved problematic , however : at one point 14 @entity183 legislators fled the state to nearby @entity186 , @entity148 , denying republicans the quorum they needed to hold a vote			2
he later survived a recall campaign led by unions , collecting more votes than he had during his election to office			0
halfway there ? with @entity3 's new right - to - work law , it 's now illegal in half of @entity46 's 50 states to require the payment of union dues as a condition of employment about 5,000 union supporters marched against ' right to work ' legislation on feb. 28 in @entity160 , @entity3 , a fraction of the estimated 100,000 who had massed near the state capitol four years earlier in another @entity212 protest @entity2 is now fine - tuning campaign messages in advance of what is expected to be a bruising @entity19 presidential primary season – and many of those talking points have @entity0 in their crosshairs			1
ten days ago at the @entity220 , he lambasted @entity0 for what he said was a weak performance fighting the @entity224 terror army overseas			0
@entity46 needs a leader who ' realizes that radical @entity227 terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom - loving people , ' he said ' if i can do that with 100,000 protesters , i can do the same across the world , ' @entity2 later claimed , bringing howls for the comparison of his critics to violent @entity227			0
' he is even less qualified to be president than i thought , ' a @entity183 spokesman said in response			0
the super pac supporting @entity2 , called @entity245 , defended the right - to - work law on tuesday			2
' workforce participation is up in @entity3 because @entity2 is a leader who tackled the tough economic problems left by his predecessor , ' the @entity244 's spokeswoman @entity247 said in a statement			1
' @entity13 is happening because @entity3 supports it but also because it 's pro-growth , pro-freedom and pro-work			0

@entity3 gov. @entity2 signed a bill into law on monday , making his state the 25th to ban requiring union dues as a condition of employment
president @entity0 fired back , calling the wave of similar laws ' a sustained , coordinated assault on unions '
@entity2 has emerged as the @entity19 's latest front - running in the 2016 hunt for the @entity43 and is already using the bill - signing to raise money
@entity19 - *dominated* state legislature *approved* the bill in just two weeks
