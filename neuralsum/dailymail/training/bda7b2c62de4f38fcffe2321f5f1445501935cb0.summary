by @entity0 published : 04:12 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 20 july 2012 a shop worker forced to dump her car in @entity3 when flood waters made roads impassable returned to find a £ 50 parking ticket slapped to her windscreen			1
@entity8 , 55 , of @entity9 , was driving home from work at a co-operative shop in torrential rain when rising flood waters stopped her in her tracks			1
mrs @entity8 quickly parked up in a council - run car park - intending to come back when conditions were safer - but was outraged to discover the fine when she returned less than two hours later			1
disbelief : @entity8 was stunned to find the penalty charge on her windscreen after rising flood waters forced her to ditch her car in @entity3 she has now had an appeal against the penalty rejected			1
' i just could n't believe it , ' she said			0
' there was no way i could get home			0
i thought i was doing the right thing by parking it up somewhere out of the way and coming back when it was safer			0
' mrs @entity8 tried alternative routes to get home from her early morning shift at the co-op store in @entity37 on july 7 , driving through @entity38 and making it as far as @entity40 before finally admitting defeat and parking up her @entity42			2
' i did n't have any money with me because i 'd been at work and you 're not allowed to carry cash , ' she said			0
' so i could n't buy a ticket			0
' i thought that because of the flooding i 'd be okay there for a couple of hours			0
' torrential : the flash floods that forced mrs @entity8 to abandon her car also saw the @entity53 burst its banks , as @entity3 was hit by a deluge of heavy rain but a passing traffic warden evidently chose not to take the weather conditions into consideration , and duly issued mrs @entity8 with the £ 50 fine			1
the shop worker had parked up at around 10.45am on the day of the flooding			2
she was offered a lift by a woman in a 4x4 and walked back to her car less than two hours later , by which time flood waters had receded			2
mrs @entity8 appealed to @entity67 , but the local authority upheld the fine			1
she was told : ' after careful consideration of the circumstances , we have found no grounds for cancellation of the charge			0

torrential rain meant @entity3 shop worker @entity8 , 55 , had ' no way home '
car had been in the council car park less than two hours when the fine was issued
local authority has refused to waive the penalty
