by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 15 august 2012 a series of blunders : dr @entity3 outside her fitness to @entity6 hearing in @entity7 a consultant who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient was ' hasty , careless , and dismissive ' before , during and after the procedure , a tribunal has found			1
dr @entity3 , who botched an operation to remove an ectopic pregnancy and left the woman - referred to as patient a - unable to conceive naturally , was found to have made a series of errors over an 18 - hour period at @entity18			1
a fitness to practise panel , held by the @entity21 , found dr @entity23 ’s fitness to practice had been impaired by the misconduct			2
the finding said the doctor had acted ' against the patient ’s interests ' and that her actions had ' undermined public confidence in the medical profession '			1
dr @entity33 , chairman of the panel , said : ' you did not provide good clinical care to @entity36 ' you acted against your patient ’s interests and failed to take action when this was brought to your attention			1
' the panel is of the opinion that your actions have caused patient harm , have brought the profession into disrepute and have undermined public confidence in the profession			2
' the panel noted that while she had an ' unblemished career ' before and after the incident , dr @entity23 had ' failed patient a during each stage of her care and treatment '			1
it said : ' you were careless in your pre-operative approach , hasty in your intra-operative approach and dismissive of the patient ’s concerns in your post-operative approach			0
' dr @entity23 admitted to the panel previously that she had not checked which tube contained the ectopic pregnancy and did not correctly identify the tube during the surgery on september 21 , 2010			1
an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg begins to develop outside of the womb , usually in the fallopian tubes			0
the pregnancy can cause life - threatening bleeding if left untreated			2
patient a had been trying to conceive for about two years when she fell pregnant but went to her gp when she suffered bleeding			0
after initially being told she had suffered a miscarriage and ordered to rest , the woman went to @entity18 's @entity78 when the bleeding worsened			0
doctors discovered she had an ectopic pregnancy and told her she would have to undergo surgery to remove the affected tube			0
@entity72 , who can not be named for legal reasons , was concerned after the operation and challenged what had happened as she had pain in her right side			0
the patient had previously been told that the ectopic pregnancy had been present in her left fallopian tube			1
the panel heard that , when challenged , dr @entity23 said it was obvious that the right side must have had the ectopic pregnancy			2
@entity97 , prosecuting , said : ' dr @entity23 was then told the woman had a cyst in her right fallopian tube - a separate and unrelated issue			1
she had looked shocked and had asked to see the patient ’s notes			0
' dr @entity23 did not order further tests before telling the patient to go home , where the pregnancy ruptured			2
the patient then underwent emergency surgery to have the correct fallopian tube removed , meaning she lost both tubes in three days			0
the panel will now decide what sanctions will be bought against dr @entity23 .			0

consultant made a series of blunders over an 18 - hour period
dr @entity3 acted ' against the patient 's interests ' , said medical panel
patient a was left *infertile* after the surgeon operated on the *healthy* tube
