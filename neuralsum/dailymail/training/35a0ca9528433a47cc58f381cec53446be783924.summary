it ’s the relationship advice that you definitely wo n’t find in her book			0
‘ @entity5 ’ @entity5 stole her husband away from his first wife after meeting him at work , @entity4 can reveal			1
@entity9 , 59 , sparked a national conversation and won infamy for herself when she wrote an article urging young women to find a husband while at college - ideally @entity17 , her alma mater - and not put their careers first			1
but she her adamantly declined to talk about her own marital past , aside from revealing that she is divorced and has two sons			0
now @entity4 can reveal that her ex is advertising executive @entity24			2
it was @entity9 ’s first day working at an advertising agency in the 1980 ’s when she spotted @entity24 on the job and shocked colleagues over a meet - and - greet lunch by saying : ‘ i ’m gon na marry that man ! ’ marry @entity32 : @entity9 's advice to young women is to invest the same time in finding the right man as they do in their careers			1
but she admits she did n't practice what she preached revealed ! this is the ex. @entity39 was determined to marry @entity24 the moment she saw him on her first day at work in the ' 80 's			1
they have since divorced when they protested that he was already happily married , she ignored them and began a years - long process of ‘ wearing him down ’			0
@entity24 stood no chance against brassy @entity9 who ‘ bowled him over ’ - and swept his wife aside			1
earlier this year she wrote a book , @entity54 , expounding on her theory and was condemned by feminists who said that she taking women back to the 1950s			0
but she her adamantly declined to talk about her own marital past aside from revealing that she is divorced and has two sons			0
in interviews @entity9 has admitted that she did not follow her own advice , but only now can the full story be told			1
when she met @entity24 they were both in their late 20s and the agency they worked for was @entity68 / @entity67 , run by famed illustrator @entity68 when the industry was in the last throes of the @entity72 age			2
ouch : @entity9 chided her ex for not attending a prestigious ivy league college			1
good - humored @entity24 made a joke of it on his @entity78 page @entity24 , now a pudgy , balding 60 , came from the unglamorous @entity80 neighborhood of @entity81 in the city and attended a humble college on @entity84			1
@entity9 would later snobbily refer to it as a ‘ college of almost no name recognition ’			1
and @entity24 would later use the line in his @entity78 profile			2
she herself had come from the @entity92 , a tough borough of @entity93 , and was raised by @entity95 immigrant parents who were both @entity96 survivors before she was accepted at the prestigious @entity17			2
by the time @entity9 joined the advertising agency as an account executive , @entity24 was already well established			1
he was also married to his first wife , @entity100 , who is now 61			0
school daze : @entity9 gloats about her @entity17 roots , but she was so eager to get married and have kids she settled for someone who went to a ' college of almost no name recognition ' a source told @entity4 : ‘ it was @entity5 ’s very first day and she had lunch with a few of her colleagues , a get to know you kind of thing			1
‘ @entity24 was there too but he was n’t at the table so @entity5 , bold as brass , tells them : ‘ i ’m gon na marry that man ! ’ ‘ i think everyone was a bit taken aback			1
‘ his wife was really nice , a calm person			0
she was like a librarian - she did n’t have a chance against @entity5			2
‘ @entity24 was a mellow kind of guy			2
he was popular with the ladies , he was easygoing			0
he was too passive , that was his problem			0
‘ it took a few years but she managed to wear him down			0
@entity24 was just too nice and so was his wife			2
she would n’t take no for an answer ’			0
@entity135 's boy : @entity17 senior @entity136 uses his mother 's last name on his @entity139			2
he was recently dubbed ' the hottest guy on campus ' thanks to his mother 's notoriety @entity24 moved to advertising firms @entity145 and @entity146 before founding his own company , which he runs to this day under the name @entity24 and partners			1
@entity9 ’s decision to stick with @entity24 appears to be more functional than romantic			1
in an interview she said : ‘ after i graduated i spent years dating men who were not nearly as good as the men in my class			0
‘ ultimately i married the man i was dating when i was 31 , because i was running out of time to have children			1
' they have two sons are @entity136 , 21 , a senior at @entity17 , where he is studying art history and @entity162 , 25 , who studied history at @entity17 and then went to @entity165			0
he now works at a @entity167 law firm			0
a video from @entity162 ’s wedding at the @entity170 in @entity167 shows him getting married to a young woman named @entity172 , 25 , who studied computer science at @entity17 and is now an analyst at @entity175			2
her @entity17 credentials are impeccable - even her father @entity177 attended the college , where he studied mathematics			2
the wedding video includes a shot of @entity9 grinning broadly , no doubt delighted that her older son was doing what she says - and not what she herself did			0
legal eagle : @entity24 and @entity9 's son @entity162 is another @entity17 grad who went on to law school			1
he practices in @entity167 @entity9 ’s reputation comes from the blunt nature of the advice in her book ‘ @entity195 ’ , which has been branded everything from ‘ sexist ’ to ‘ slapdash ’			0
it includes advice to women such as : ‘ potential buyers are unmotivated if offered free merchandise , i.e. , it ’s the lonely cow that gives away free milk ’			0
she also blamed women if they get sexually assaulted while drunk and said the term ‘ date rape ’ was too ‘ politically correct ’			0
there was also this missive : ‘ if you ’ve struggled with obesity through most of your teen years , then maybe surgical intervention is a good idea for you ’			0
there is little advice about what to do if a relationship ends however , so it might prove useful to see what happened in @entity9 ’s case			0
a source told @entity4 that on the first day of her divorce hearing @entity9 was in court but told the judge to stop when he announced that proceedings had got underway			1
@entity9 said that they had to wait until mr @entity24 arrived , but the judge informed her he was in fact already present			1
@entity9 turned and looked her soon - to - be ex and said : ‘ @entity231 ! he ’s got so fat ! ’ @entity24 declined to comment to @entity4 but said in an email : ‘ as tempted as i am to voice my perspective on @entity5 , her book and her opinions , out of respect for my sons ' privacy , i will refrain from doing so			1

' i *'m* gon na marry that man , ' @entity5 , known as ' the @entity5 ' , told colleagues at work , pointing to already married @entity24
' she bowled him over . she would n't take no for an answer ' , says a friend
her *guidance* to girls : find a guy while you *'re* in college
@entity9 , who graduated from @entity17 , pokes fun at her ex for attending a school with ' no name recognition '
she admits she married @entity24 because she was 31 and she was running out of time to have children
when she saw him in divorce court she said , ' @entity266 . he 's got so fat ! '
