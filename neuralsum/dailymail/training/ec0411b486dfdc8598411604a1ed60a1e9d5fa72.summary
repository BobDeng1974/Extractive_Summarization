@entity0 is the likely victor in today 's gubernatorial election as he is leading his @entity3 rival by 20 points and is expected to hold on to his job for another four years			1
that said , @entity7 was clear during the campaign that if he decides to run for an even bigger title - as he has been loudly considered a possible presidential nominee - he will have no problem leaving office before his second term as governor comes to a close			1
that admission would hurt many candidates , but not @entity7 as voting booths opened in @entity19 on tuesday with him beating his @entity3 rival @entity21 by a wide margin			1
taking it all in : @entity7 laughs at the jokes that her husband @entity25 made to reporters after voting in @entity27 , @entity19 on tuesday happy day : @entity0 is expected to win a second term as @entity19 governor when the state votes in their gubernatorial election today and he is leading by 20 points in the latest polls keep smiling : @entity21 went up against @entity7 after working as a state senator and she used her campaign to paint him as an ambitious conservative out for only himself casting her vote : @entity21 , with her husband @entity39 standing behind her , signs in at the voting station mrs @entity21 was the first of the two to cast her vote , wearing a blue skirt suit and waving to fans at the @entity46 polling station			1
@entity7 commented for the first time about the fact that a member of @entity51 's campaign staff leaked the @entity19 governor 's private vetting file to two reporters writing a book about the 2012 campaign			1
in the files , several potentially embarrassing disclosures were made about @entity7 's past including lawsuits and favoritism when it comes to awarding state contracts			2
' when it came to light a few months ago that it had leaked , @entity51 called me right away , and i could tell he was really embarrassed and outraged about it and i think thats the kind of reaction that the person in charge should have , ' @entity7 said in an interview with @entity72 on @entity73			2
the authors of the book in question , @entity76 , have not revealed their source but it had to be someone within @entity51 's inner circle			2
@entity7 brushed off the issue , but said that it was clearly a reflection of someone 's feelings against him and not the handful of other @entity85 vetted by @entity51 's team who had similar files			2
' there 's nothing in there that i have a huge problem with and it seems it only happened to me , ' he said			2
@entity7 spent much of the past week traveling across the state in an effort to ensure voter turnout , and if his supporters cast their vote , he may become the first @entity85 governor to win a state - wide office by more than 50 per cent since former president @entity101 did so in 1988			1
@entity7 was last seen on monday , making the rounds at a series of campaign stops including one photo opp at a bakery in @entity107			0
the @entity85 's weight has been an issue of public debate ever since he was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate for @entity51 last year			0
' i feel really good , ' @entity7 told @entity72 's @entity113 on @entity73			0
' we 're a little more than halfway to my goal in the last 8 months and i sleep better and the biggest difference to me is that i did n't feel badly at my previous weight but i did n't realize how badly i slept which is bad for my staff because i have more energy than i did before which i did n't think was possible			0
' he has repeatedly brushed off the concerns about his health by saying it is a personal issue but he also announced in may that he had undergone lap - band surgery two months prior to help combat his obesity			0
as part of his campaign , @entity7 allowed his doctor to give a report on his health status saying that the 51 - year - old has been ' losing weight steadily ' since the february operation			0
' governor @entity7 has normal blood work , normal cardiovascular test results , and good functional capacity , ' said dr @entity140			1
get in there : governor @entity0 shakes the hand of a worker at the @entity144 in @entity107 , @entity19 during a campaign stop on monday , just hours before polls open in his re-election bid steering clear : the @entity85 governor 's weight has been a concern for some political operatives and may have been a contributing factor for why he was passed over in the choice of @entity51 's vice presidential selection being good : since having lap - band surgery in february , @entity7 's doctor said that he is half way towards his weight goal but would not disclose what that number was the doctor would not give a specific figure to @entity164 during an interview last week , but did say that @entity7 is ' more than halfway ' to his goal weight			1
while his weight has largely been an issue for critics , but a new book that gives a backstage look at the 2012 election reveals that it is something that his allies thought about as well			0
@entity7 was listed as part of @entity51 's short list for vice presidential candidates , and the campaign tell - all ' @entity76 ' , as reported by @entity177 , shows that the candidate 's team used fish - themed nicknames for each of the secret subjects			0
as such , @entity7 was given the moniker ' pufferfish '			0
facing off : the latest poll has @entity7 beating his @entity3 opponent @entity21 by 20 points many directions : even if he is re-elected on tuesday , he has said that he would consider running for president in 2016 which would force him to leave the governorship before his term ends the latest poll conducted by @entity197 reported by @entity198 , has @entity7 beating his @entity3 opponent @entity21 by 20 points , with him winning the race 57 per cent to 37 per cent			1
the presumed victory comes as little surprise as @entity7 is popular on both sides of the aisle and received some record - breaking approval numbers following his handling of @entity206			0
his campaign staff were not the only ones who expected a victory , as the @entity3 governor 's @entity211 only spent $ 5,000 to support his competitor .			1

governor @entity0 is running for re-election and polls open tuesday
he is leading against his @entity3 rival @entity21 by 20 points
