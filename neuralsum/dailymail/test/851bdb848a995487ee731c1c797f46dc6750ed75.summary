this is one safety video you wo n't be able to take your eyes off			0
a dramatic virtual environment has been created using a headset that shows how passengers would survive a plane crash landing on water			1
the short film has been developed on an @entity9 - a virtual reality headset - by @entity11 's @entity13 's @entity12 it is hoped the simulation can make people aware of the correct processes to follow for a landing on water the video is based on an actual event when , on january 15 , 2009 , @entity22 was forced into a landing on water			1
following a series of bird strikes , both engines failed , and the @entity28 , piloted by captain @entity29 was forced to land in the @entity30			1
incredibly of the 155 on board , only one person was hospitalised ovenight , and the incident became known as ' @entity22			2
' with the dramatic background music , this video could well prove to be much more effective than a safety notice and demonstration			0
the scene begins by the passenger being welcomed onto the plane by the flight attendant , before a gentle walk to locate the seat			0
the start of the virtual reality programme starts casual enough as the passenger moves to their seat a large bang is heard on the simulation before the plane starts to rapidly descend once seated the film jolts into action when a loud bang is heard , and the plane rocks from side to side			1
as the plane descends quickly and abruptly , the user is told that the ' goal is to come out unharmed from the aircraft by following safe procedures			1
' the first thing to do is inflate the life jacket			0
what follows is a jog down the cabin and to the emergency exit , where the flight attendant is beckoning you out of the door and onto the evacuation slide			0
the video pans to the passenger reaching into the overhead lockers for their luggage but doing this results in putting yourself in immense danger of drowning in the incoming water there are cries , screams and shouting , just what you would expect from the real thing			1
a chilling scene then appears telling you to beware of making mistakes - in this instance it is wasting time grabbing luggage			0
this is shown when , after grabbing the luggage , the passenger is overcome with water - this actually forces the man who has taken the simulation on to remove the headset and puff his cheeks			1
speaking to @entity104 , @entity105 , head of the project , said : ' the ' @entity108 ' demo we have just released for the @entity9 was developed in the last year , and is just one of a series of aviation safety education games we are developing for all possible technological platforms , not just the @entity9			1
' airlines are already using video safety briefings on - board some aircrafts and they do not seem to engage passenger 's attention any more than conventional briefings			0
of the simulation video , he added : ' it 's a personalized , experiential way of learning , more engaging than passively watching a video or a safety briefing or reading a safety card			0
' this user made it as far as the ' what happens if you reach for your baggage ' before the water overpowering him made him remove the headset and it produces measurable results			2
' in the study of our virtual water landing experience , we had one group of people study a traditional airline safety card and another group playing the virtual reality game , ' added @entity105			2
' after one week , people who had studied the safety card suffered a significant loss of knowledge , while passengers who had played the game fully retained the safety knowledge gained			0
' considering that ' @entity108 ' is the world 's first prototype of an airliner water landing and evacuation experience , we are satisfied with the result			2

simulation available on @entity9 shows plane crashing on water
cries , screams and shouting heard as plane rapidly descends
shows what happens if you make *attempts* to grab your luggage
based on actual incident in 2009 when @entity171 airways @entity28 made *successful* landing in @entity30 with no casualties
