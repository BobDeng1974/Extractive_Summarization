@entity1 goes up against @entity3 in @entity9 on saturday night but @entity1 must first face the unbeaten @entity3 in @entity9			1
‘ i believe @entity1 will beat @entity3 and i want him to win because i want to be the one to beat him in @entity7 and put an end to his reign , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we ’ve been in discussions to get the fight on , hopefully at one of the big football stadiums in september			0
it ’s something which i ’ve left with my promoter and team and things are looking positive though it takes a very brave or stupid man to step in the ring with @entity0			0
‘ i ’m the heavyweight who is going to take over this division because i have everything that is needed			0
@entity1 has had a good run but it ’s time for a change because the heavyweight division needs an injection of new blood and i ’m ready to provide that			2
’ reigning heavyweight champion @entity1 shake hands with @entity3 , left , after the weigh - in @entity1 has held a portion of the world title since 2000 but @entity0 is convinced he is the man to beat him			1
‘ i ’m mandatory for the @entity40 title and if @entity1 does defend it against me he wo n’t last more than eight rounds because i will be knocking him out after being involved in a bit of a brawl early on , ’ he added			1
‘ i know his flaws and i know how to beat him – for once he will be picking on someone his own size			0
‘ a fight with @entity1 does n’t concern me because i know i will beat him , it ’s just a matter of how and what round i do the job in			0
i ’m still not fully convinced he has the balls to step in the ring with me but if he does then i take my hat off to him because it will be the night the @entity1 era ends and the @entity0 one begins			2
