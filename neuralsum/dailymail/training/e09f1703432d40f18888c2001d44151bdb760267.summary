@entity0 have endured some humiliations at the hands of @entity3 in recent years ; notably there was that awful 8 - 2 defeat at @entity6 among a smattering of comprehensive victories , as @entity10 ’s team have waned from their previous position of power			1
they have bided their time in north @entity15 and have waited patiently for the roles to be reversed , for @entity3 to be vulnerable and exposed			1
and when their moment came , they failed utterly			0
worse than that ; they presented @entity3 with the points			1
of all the indignities heaped on this @entity0 side in recent years , saturday ’s defeat ranks as one of the more significant			2
it is not that @entity0 were bad , as going forward they were exceptional at times			2
indeed , had they drawn this game , it would have felt like a missed opportunity			0
@entity3 captain @entity31 celebrates scoring his side 's second in their 2 - 1 win away at @entity0 @entity31 ( right ) doubled @entity3 's advantage with a delicate left - footed chip over replacement goalkeeper @entity37 ( left ) @entity31 ( bottom right ) is mobbed by his @entity3 team - mates after putting them 2 - 0 ahead in the 85th minute @entity31 ( left ) celebrates his strike in front of the delirious travelling @entity3 supporters @entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity44 5 ( @entity37 59 - 5 ) , @entity45 6 , mertesacker 6 , @entity46 5.5 , @entity47 5.5 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 5.5 ( @entity50 77 - 6.5 ) , @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 7 ( @entity53 55 - 6 ) , @entity54 7.5 , @entity55 6.5			1

the fact that they could contrive to lose to such a weakened @entity3 side in a game which they might have had wrapped up within 20 minutes was stupefying			2
and their sheer absence of ruthlessness indicates just how fragile they have become : a mentally - flawed team that has turned losing games from dominant positions into an art form			0
‘ it was a game that we dominated for 80 per cent of the time and it ’s a long time since we have dominated games against @entity3 like we did today , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ but we were not efficient enough in the final third and we made a mistake at the back			0
we had plenty of chances : their keeper is man of the match and that tells you the story of the game			0
’ @entity84 ’s brazenness is generally characterised as genius ; it looked closer to madness in those opening 20 minutes as @entity3 flailed in defence			2
a back three of @entity65 , @entity64 and @entity66 was encouragement enough to @entity0 and within 15 minutes @entity3 had also lost @entity67 to injury			1
@entity10 ’s side attacked like a team that knew they were in the ascendancy , @entity51 leading the way , playing with an intensity which was exhilarating			0
the chances came in a flurry : a free header for @entity140 ; a header over from @entity55 after superb play from @entity54 ; a shot from @entity52 , after he drove through a vacant @entity3 midfield			1
but principally there was @entity52 ’s chance on 15 minutes , created by @entity51 chasing down @entity147 , whose consequent weak clearance reached only @entity55 , who fed @entity52			2
charging through @entity3 ’s defence again and this time less than six yards out with only @entity63 to beat , @entity52 hesitated before shooting into the @entity3 goalkeeper ’s body : it was a terrible miss. ‘ i was not pleased with the way we had played in the first half , ’ @entity152 said			1
‘ i have to say the first 25 minutes we gave the ball so easily away , it ’s not possible for a top team			0
@entity0 created a lot of chances , but fortunately we have a very good goalkeeper in @entity147 ‘ if @entity0 had score in the first 20 minutes , it would have been another game and then maybe i would have had to respond to all the questions because i had chosen three defenders - but now i can laugh			1
@entity55 ( left ) spurned a great chance against his former side in the open minutes when his shot was blocked by @entity65 @entity0 could have easily been 2 - 0 ahead in the opening minutes when @entity52 saw a brilliant opportunity saved @entity3 boss @entity84 had to reshuffle his defence early following an injury to left back @entity67 ( centre ) @entity67 ( left ) rolled his left ankle in the seventh minute after clearing his lines following an @entity0 attack @entity67 ( left ) shakes the hand of former @entity179 team - mate @entity178 as he leaves the field before @entity67 ( right ) was substituted , @entity0 felt they should have had a penalty after @entity52 fell under his challenge @entity52 was lucky not to be sent off after appearing to headbutt @entity72 during the first half the incident brought a heated exchange between the two players which needed the intervention of both sets of teams @entity147 ( centre ) had an excellent performance in goal for the @entity193 denying several @entity0 shots click here to view our brilliant @entity196 including the move for @entity47 ' own goal @entity200 miles @entity0 109.3 67.9 @entity178 90 11.4 7.1 @entity48 90 10.8 6.7 @entity55 90 10.4 6.5 @entity3 112.6 70.0 @entity72 90 12.1 7.5 @entity31 90 11.3 7.0 @entity70 90 11.1 6.9 @entity52 ’s miss proved significant , as @entity3 slowly began to settle and @entity52 it was who was un-nerved enough on 30 minutes to butt his head into @entity72 ’s chin			1
he was lucky to stay on the pitch , let alone not even earn a yellow card			2
@entity0 started the second half well , with @entity54 delivering a delightful ball for @entity55 , who found his way blocked again by @entity63			1
try as he might , @entity55 could not punish @entity152 for his lack of faith in his talent			0
and shortly after @entity52 had to depart with an ankle injury after a terrible challenge from @entity65			2
and yet @entity0 are always only a moment away from calamity			2
an @entity68 cross on 56 minutes was directed at a marginally offside @entity72 but @entity47 and @entity44 got themselves in a terrible mess , colliding and knocking each other over			1
@entity71 fired in a relatively harmless cross , but @entity47 inexplicably lifted his leg while still grounded			0
with his goalkeeper still struggling , winded and injured , @entity47 diverted the ball into his own net			1
worse for @entity0 , @entity44 had to come off immediately after the goal with @entity37 replacing him			0
suddenly @entity64 looked a leader , making crucial interceptions and pulling @entity65 and @entity66 into shape			0
there was a @entity51 header on 63 minutes and a fine @entity53 strike on 69 minutes , but then @entity0 lost the ball on the edge of the @entity3 box on 86 minutes - they are never more of a danger to themselves than when on the attack - and @entity72 swept the ball to @entity239			1
he advanced it on to @entity31 , who finished with a cool confidence			0
‘ it was just after a corner and we were not cautious enough , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t know why we had nobody at the back at all			0
’ it might have been 3 - 0 , @entity73 chipping wide when he seemed sure to score from another breakaway			0
@entity50 then provided his late riposte , but such finery could not disguise @entity0 ’s failings			1
‘ there ’s discordance between possession and the chances we create and our results , ’ said @entity10			0
‘ it ’s very difficult but we have to keep faith in what we do			0

@entity3 took the lead in the second half after @entity0 defender @entity47 put through his own net
@entity3 captain @entity31 doubled their lead in the closing stages of the match with a left - footed chip
@entity50 scored a *consolation* for the @entity299 with a terrific strike , which made it for a nervy ending
@entity52 was lucky to escape a red card after appearing to headbutt @entity72 in the first half
