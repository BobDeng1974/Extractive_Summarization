it 's complicated , but there i was in a @entity4 resort in @entity5 , not with my wife @entity6 but with my best friend from university , @entity7			1
by coincidence we had pitched up together to review the 14th in the @entity4 chain			2
neither of us had been before , but @entity14 only ? weddings on the beach ? @entity17 and i , both hard - bitten travellers , were set to sneer			2
@entity20 has 225 suites spread over three ‘ villages ’ in a small sandy bay			1
on arrival @entity24 , the manager , tells me his philosophy is ‘ to give guests more than they expect ’ , and at first glance it ’s hard to tell who ’s happier – the 350 guests or the 500 staff			1
certainly everyone appears to be grinning constantly , as if part of a cult - the @entity36			2
among @entity5 's 225 suites is the @entity38 , with this stunning private infinity pool the three ' village ' luxury all - inclusive resort hosts 350 guests with 500 staff our personal butlers , trained by the @entity46 , take us to our ( separate ) rooms			1
@entity17 ’s giant suite features a black marble bath and a terrace with plunge pool and @entity52			2
meanwhile , i follow my butler , @entity55 , up to my @entity56			0
@entity55 hands me a mobile telephone and says : ‘ anything you need , i ’m a phone call away			1
’ from my private infinity pool , i look out over the fort , and reflect on what i know about @entity5			1
it is mountainous , measuring just 12 miles by 21 , with a population of 110,000 , a high level of literacy and land ownership , and one of the lowest crime figures in the @entity71			0
the island ’s recent peaceful history has emerged from two tempests			0
one was a natural phenomenon , @entity76 , that struck in september 2004 and destroyed 85 per cent of houses and vegetation , including @entity5 ’s precious nutmeg trees			1
@entity20 is situated on a sandy bay on mountainous @entity5 , an island just 12 by 21 miles among the resort 's shared facilities is three freshwater swimming pools including this in the ' @entity86 ' village the second was political : the 1983 @entity89 coup in which prime minister @entity90 was killed – a move that prompted @entity93 to land 6,000 @entity95 troops on what was part of the @entity98			1
my father was a @entity100 diplomat at the time , and he recalls meeting the @entity101 shortly after the invasion			0
@entity17 and i find the scale of the resort overwhelming			1
there are nine restaurants , several bars , and even an @entity109 pub. after some fishing , during which i catch and release a 200lb blue marlin , i land an audience with the island ’s popular prime minister			0
dr @entity115 greets us barefoot at his official residence , where we chat about @entity5 ’s future as an eco-tourist centre and its current peace and stability , which he ascribes to his people ’s inherently cheerful nature			1
the @entity4 resort occupies the heart of @entity5 's exclusive @entity127 writer @entity128 enjoys a pedalo ride with his friend @entity7 the @entity132 's living room opens up to a trellised veranda with a private plunge pool back at @entity20 , @entity17 and i attend a beach ‘ @entity137 ’ ceremony			1
two couples , from @entity139 and @entity140 , both married for more than 20 years , arrive for a moving service conducted with palpable delight by @entity144 pastor @entity143 , looking splendid in lime - green linen			0
@entity4 ( 0800 597 0002 ) offers seven nights at @entity147 from £ 1,629pp			0
this includes @entity149 ( all - inclusive ) accommodation in a @entity151 with @entity152 , return flights from @entity154 and resort transfers			1
valid for travel between september 1 and october 20 , 2015			0
there are tears of joy as well as laughter as @entity161 and @entity162 , both in full - length cream and carrying white orchids , walk up the jetty to a small pavilion hanging over the sea to repledge their love to husbands @entity170 and @entity172 respectively			2
the staff are in white waistcoats and ties for the occasion			2
the couples have prepared statements to read to each other , giving thanks for the love and lives they share			0
it is the simplest , most genuine and therefore the most profoundly moving service i ’ve been to … well , since my own wedding			0
@entity17 and i weep openly			0
@entity4 is victorious – cynicism is slain .			0
