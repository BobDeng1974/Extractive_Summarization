by @entity0 the key to any good flashmob is the element of surprise , but for these tricksters the surprise was on them when police turned up and began arresting everyone			0
prank group @entity10 ran into trouble while pretending to be shop mannequins in a @entity14 branch of @entity15 after an employee called police			1
around 40 people went into the shop dressed in @entity15 clothing with white bodysuits underneath , before zipping the suits up at a predetermined time and posing next to genuine mannequins			1
concerned by a spate of burglaries disguised as flashmobs at other nearby stores , officers promptly cuffed around 20 of the human mannequins before laying them out on the floor			1
' we were very surprised at the response , ' @entity10 founder @entity10 told @entity58			0
' it was distressing to see these people who were just helping me out down on the floor in handcuffs			2
' however , when cops realised people were just part of an innocent stunt , they decided to let them go			2
the store manager said he considered banning the participants for life , but had decided against it			0
they then posed next to genuine mannequins dotted around the store ( the fake mannequin is on the right ) initially members of the public and staff were filmed laughing at the trick ( fake mannequin is on the far right ) at a glance the intruders are almost indistinguishable from the real thing ( fakes are left , in glasses , and right ) by strange coincidence , it turned out that one policeman recognised some of the group 's organisers , because he had taken part in one of their flashmobs last summer			1
on that occasion 7,000 people dressed up like tourists and went to @entity101 's @entity100 as part of an @entity104 experiment			0
they were asked to download a track on to their mp3 player , then press play at a predetermined time and follow the instructions they were given			0
@entity10 has carried out roughly 20 pranks in stores including @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , all of which passed off without much of a fuss			2
while some people remained oblivious to what was going on , it was n't long before one staff member called police by coincidence it turned out that there had been a spate of robberies nearby disguised as flashmobs , so when cops arrived they placed around 20 of the mannequins in handcuffs and laid them on the floor however , after establishing it was just a harmless prank , officers let the participants go			1
by coincidence , it turned out that one policeman had actually taken part in another of the group 's flashmobs last summer the last time police were called in was during a prank at @entity144 eight years ago when participants dressed up like employees and stood around the store helping members of the public out			1
while nobody was handcuffed on that occasion , they were all forced to leave the store after staff became concerned .			0
